CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2015 III EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017 III Highlights: Withholding known health history or pertinent exam findings may negate a policy if a claim is made. Veterinarians shouldn't succumb to owner pressure to misrepresent the severity or duration of a condition. Permission to euthanize should be received from the insurance company to protect the owner's ability to collect. Each insurance policy for a horse is a contract between the horse owner and the insurance company, and the policy dictates the specific terms and conditions concerning the payment of a claim. There are various types of insurance that owners can purchase for their horse, including accidental death, mortality, health, loss of use and fertility. Equine veterinarians become involved in the process when asked by the owner to perform an \"insurance exam,\" which may be required by the insurance company before a policy is issued. Each insurance company has their own criteria that determines the need for an insurance examination, such as age of the horse, value of the horse, certain breeds and/or uses, and history of previous lameness or illness. Unlike with human life insurance, where the insurance company typically retains a physician to perform the examination on the person to be insured on the company's behalf and at their expense, with equine insurance it is usually the respon-sibility of the owner to request and pay for the examination that is actually being performed on behalf of the insurance company. This arrangement can lead to an ethical dilemma for the veterinarian. Being honest with client, insurance company The scope of this examination is usually dictated by having the veterinarian answer a series of questions on a \"certificate of veterinary examination\" form about the health of the horse that is to be insured. In cases of a new purchase of the animal, the company may accept a written copy of the pre-purchase exam, which is often in greater detail than the standard insurance exam form. It is important for the veterinarian to fully understand the type of policy/coverage that the owner is requesting as this will impact the type of examination performed, for example reproductive health versus basic mortality coverage. It is incumbent upon the veterinarian to answer each question to the best of their ability based on the results of a thorough physical examination that they perform on the horse to be insured; and, theoretically, if the veterinarian is the regular attending veterinarian for the horse to be insured, they are ethically obliged to report to the insurance company any knowledge they have regarding the health history of the horse in question, even though reporting such information might adversely affect the insurability of the horse. Likewise, most applications for insurance require that the owner disclose any and all infor-mation they know of pertaining to the health history of the horse to be insured. Failure to disclose such informa-tion by either the owner or the examining veterinarian may negate the policy if and when a claim is made. Therefore, prior to performing an insurance examination for a client, the client should be informed and forewarned of the consequences of what you, as an ethical veterinarian, must do to be forthright with the insurance company. Any attempt to withhold pertinent information from the insurance company concerning the health of a horse that might affect its insurability to protect the interests of your client may ultimately result in you being held liable if a claim is denied because of your failure to report a pre-exist-ing condition that is discovered during the investigation of a claim by the insurance company. For the reasons mentioned previously, performing an insurance exam should not be taken lightly and insurance examination forms should never be filled out for a client without you having performed a Ethics: Role of ethical equine veterinarians in equine insurance Insurance examination forms should never be filled out for a client without you having performed a thorough and objective examination answering all questions truthfully and to the best of your ability.By Nat T. Messer, DVM; Kenton D. Morgan, DVM; and Karen A. Nyrop, MS continued on page IV McKee-Pownall Equine ServicesIV VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017 Ethics , continued from page III thorough and objective examination answering all questions truthfully and to the best of your ability.For a loss of use policy, veterinarians may be pressured by the owner to overesti-mate or overrepresent the severity of a condition or situation to the insurance company. Occasionally, a veterinarian is asked to underestimate how long a condition has been going on before contacting the insurance company. Obviously, either of these actions would be unethical and the veterinarian could be held liable if it were discovered these types of false assessments had been rendered.Recommending euthanasiaEquine veterinarians are also asked to provide their opinion when an insured patient of theirs may require euthanasia. When this situation arises, and if at all possible, the insurance company must be notified immediately before any action is taken. Most insurance companies have adjusters on call around the clock to com-municate with the owner and attending veterinarian when euthanasia of an insured horse is deemed necessary. After reporting all the facts of the case to the adjuster, the adjuster will need to grant permission for euthanasia based on the available options for the horse. The adjuster may ask for a second opinion from one of their own consulting veterinarians if the circumstances are not clear cut. In most cases, the adjuster will accept the recommendation of the attending veterinari-an. The ultimate decision to euthanize the horse rests with the owner once the insurance adjuster gives permission. It is important to distinguish between mortality insurance and loss of use insurance in these decisions. Just because an insured horse is no longer able to perform or be used does not necessarily make that horse a candidate for euthanasia. The typical mortality insurance policy does not cover a horse that is merely disabled. Again, it is our ethical obligation to make a recom-mendation for euthanasia based solely on the horse's immediate condition and to prevent unnecessary pain and suffering from a problem that has a hopeless prognosis for life.Although every effort should be made to adhere to the AAEP's Euthanasia Guidelines (see sidebar), it should not be assumed that every insurance company will accept those criteria as grounds for euthanasia of an insured horse. Therefore, it is very important to receive permission directly from the insurance company through their adjusters before euthanizing an insured horse to protect the owner's ability to collect on their insurance even though, in your opinion, the horse should be euthanized. A veterinarian should not make a recommendation for euthanasia solely to help a client make a claim and collect insurance; to do so is definitely unethical. In every case the owner is required to make provisions for a post-mor-tem examination to be performed if the owner intends to make a claim. The veteri-narian does not have the responsibility to advise the owner of this, but it serves their clients well if they remind them of this requirement.In summary, the veterinarian's role in equine insurance can provide a valuable service within the scope of a valid veterinary-client-patient relationship, but it requires both the veterinarian and the horse owner to be familiar with their respective responsibilities with regard to providing the insurance company with accurate and objective information about the current health and health history of the horse to be insured. When these steps are completed, and in the unfortunate case that a claim must be filed, the outcome for all concerned\u2014most importantly the horse\u2014will be resolved in an equitable and acceptable manner.

EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017 VII Touch Point: Use client profiles to understand differences in service needs A client's age, gender, number of horses owned and type of horses owned all should affect the way vet-erinarians approach relationship and communication issues, according to AAEP market research. The client who owns English sport horses values different things in veterinary service than the client with a single pleasure horse. The savvy and insightful veterinarian tailors his or her approach with each client based on the client's individual needs and demographic profile. One size truly does not fit all. The AAEP Touch program offers 13 different client profiles to help you better understand the individual needs of your future clients. You can view all profiles at touch.aaep.org/8-one-size-does-not-fit-all. Although the top priorities for relationship attributes and services are consistent across all demographic groups, paying attention to the subtle differences between each client type can yield the blueprint for customizing your approach within your equine practice. Touch is exclusively available to AAEP members at touch.aaep.org. You can log in using the same username and password that you use for aaep.org.

Tissue from 18 affected Friesians, 10 unaffected Friesians and 30 Warmblood horses (in which aortic rupture (amino glycosaminoglycan content) were measured wall and the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT). There was no difference in total collagen content between the three groups. At the aortic rupture site inaffected Friesians cross-linking were signi cantly higher than at the same site in unaffected horses. There were no differences in the aorta ECM between Warmbloods and unaffected Friesians. cantly in of unaffected Friesians compared to Warmbloods suggesting signi cant differences in collagen metabolism between the two breeds. There was no difference at the DDFT site between affected and unaffected Friesians, with differences only seen at the aortic rupture site, suggesting the absence of a generalised ECM disorder in the breed. Signi cant remodelling has been demonstrated at the site of aortic rupture in Friesians; these changes are not present at other sites in the body or in unaffected Friesians. Potential differences in collagen metabolism between Friesians and other breeds warrant further investigation. Direct Etest for antimicrobial susceptibility testing This study by Michele Dumoulin and colleagues in Belgiumevaluated the Etest for direct antimicrobial (AST) of agar directly determine minimum inhibitory concentrations(MICs) of 13 antimicrobials, using the Etest (direct Etest).Results were compared with those obtained with the agardilution reference method, the standard Etest, and the discdiffusion method, after subculture and standardisation of theinoculum. MICs were translated into susceptibility categories,using clinical breakpoints, to enable categorical comparisonof AST results. The direct Etest predicted categorical susceptibility/ resistance of bacteria from equine synovial fluid with acceptable accuracy (overall categorical agreement, 91%) and was more reliable than the disc diffusion test. The direct Etest was less accurate than the standard Etest for generating MICs /C61 log dilution relative to the reference method (overall essential agreement, 69% vs. 89%). The Etest generated a high percentage of inaccuracies with trimethoprim and sulfadiazine, indicating that these antimicrobial agents were less suitable for inclusion. The authors concluded that the direct Etest reliably predicted the susceptibility of isolates from equine synovialfluid for the tested antimicrobials, except for trimethoprim and sulfadiazine. As no subculture and preparation of a standardised inoculum was required, direct Etest results were available at least 24 h earlier than with other methods, which could aid the diagnosis of synovial infections. However, when accuracy is prioritised over speed for MIC determination, the standard Etest is preferred over the direct Etest. Hair shafts within synovial structures This descriptive study by Jessica Partlow and colleagues in theUSA illustrates the clinical, ultrasonographic and arthroscopiccharacteristics of hair shafts within synovial structures. Seven horses with clinical signs of in flammatory or septic synovitis/tenosynovitis that had hair shafts identi ed within those structures ultrasonographically were identi ed from medical records. Imaging ndings were rmed by surgical arthroscopy, bursoscopy, intrasynovial hyperechoic structures, which did not cast acousticshadows. These ndings support the use of ultrasonography as a complementary diagnostic method for ruling out hair foreign material in horses with signs of in flammatory or septic synovitis/tenosynovitis. Monitoring equine head-related pain This study by Johannes van Loon and Machteld VanDierendonck, based in the Netherlands and Belgium,validates a recently described pain scale, the Equine UtrechtUniversity scale for facial assessment of pain (EQUUS-FAP), inhorses with acute or post-operative pain originating from thehead, including dental or ocular pain, or trauma to the skull. This cohort study of 23 horses with head-related pain and 23 normal, healthy controls revealed signi cant differences in EQUUS-FAP scores between control horses and horses withacute or post-operative pain. In addition, pain scores aftersurgery decreased signi cantly over time. The scale predictive values (78%). Anti-in flammatories in EHV-1 infection This in vitro study by Lutz Goehring in Germany andcolleagues in the USA set out to determine the effects ofseveral anti-in flammatory drugs on endothelial cells infected with flunixin meglumine therapeutic Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were infected with EHV-1, and three experiments were performed. Experiment 1 used immortalised equine carotid artery cells. The degree of infection and subsequent cell lysis was detectable as a 'plaque ', allowing cell infection to be measured by 'plaque count per well '. All ve anti- inflammatory drugs resulted in signi cantly decreased plaque \u00a92017 Ltd234 EQUINE monolayers. Experiment 2used brain-derived endothelial cells and signi cant reduction in plaque counts were observed in monolayers treated withlidocaine, rocoxib and dexamethasone. Experiment 3 evaluated the effect of the drugs over a restricted 24 h period on infected PBMC alone, brain endothelial cells alone or both together. Lidocaine and rocoxib signi cantly reduced plaque counts when both types of cells were incubated together. This effect was not seen when only one cell type was infected, with the exception of dexamethasone, which signi cantly decreased plaque counts in PBMC cells. These results provide further evidence that infection of the central nervous system with EHV-1 appears to occur by contact between infected PBMC and endothelial cells. Crucially, infection of endothelial cells in vitro is reduced by incubation with anti-in flammatory drugs, including commonly used NSAIDs. More research is warranted to determine whether anti-in flammatories result in reduced infection rates in clinical cases of disease. Laparoscopic nephrosplenic space closure In this study Marco Gandini and colleagues in Italy evaluatedlaparoscopic nephrosplenic space ablation with barbedsuture. Eight horses (5 geldings and 3 mares) were evaluated for laparoscopic closure of the nephrosplenic space following ahistory of recurrent left dorsal displacement of the largecolon. All horses underwent a physical examination androutine clinicopathological testing. Transrectal palpation andtransabdominal ultrasonography were performed to excludethe presence of organs in the left paralumbar region. A left flank laparoscopic approach was used on standing horses. A continuous suture was placed in a craniocaudaldirection between the renal and splenic capsules withunidirectional barbed suture material. This allowed obliterationof the nephrosplenic space without the need for knots tosecure both ends of the suture line. Transrectal palpation wasperformed in all horses 2 months after surgery; at this time,closure of the caudal part of the nephrosplenic space wasevident. Follow-up laparoscopy was performed in two horsescon rming complete closure of the nephrosplenic space. Telephone follow-up revealed that none of the horses had anysigns of recurrent left dorsal displacement of the large colon. These results suggest that laparoscopic nephrosplenic space closure with unidirectional barbed suture materialcould be considered as an option for prevention of left dorsaldisplacement of the large colon in horses. Barbed suturematerial allowed secure ablation of the nephrosplenic spaceand eliminated the need for intracorporeal knot tying in thehorses in this report. Cardiopulmonary effects of anaesthesia This clinical trial by Paula Larenza Menzies and colleagues inSwitzerland evaluated cardiopulmonary effects andanaesthesia recovery in horses anaesthetised withisoflurane receiving medetomidine or S-ketamine infusions. The horses in this study, all undergoing elective surgery, were randomly allocated into two groups of 25 horses (Med treatment group or S-ket treatment group). Following acepromazine and 0.5 mg/kg bwt/h). All horses were mechanically ventilated. Cardiopulmonary variables were evaluated. Iso flurane end-tidal concentrations, dobutamine requirements and thiopental boli were recorded. Plasma samples were collected in six horses to evaluate S-ketamine and S-norketamine concentrations. After surgery, medetomidine (2 lg/kg bwt) was administered i.v. Four independent observers scored recovery using a visual analogue scale and a numerical rating scale. Both groups required similar mean iso flurane end-tidal concentrations (1%). However, S-ket horses needed more thiopental boli. Median intraoperative cardiac index values were higher with S-ket (4.5 L/min/m 2) than Med (3.9 L/min/ m2). Overall, there were no differences in heart rate, blood pressure or dobutamine requirements; however, horses in S- ket showed higher heart rate values at 30 min after anaesthesia induction. Compared with Med horses, S-ket horses showed decreased PaO 2and increased pulmonary venous admixture values. Recoveries were shorter and of poorer quality with S-ket. During infusion, S-ketamine and S- norketamine plasma concentrations lay in the ranges of 0.209 -0.917 lg/mL and 0.250 -0.723 lg/mL, respectively. Despite the higher intraoperative cardiac index with S-ket, both protocols were considered to provide acceptablecardiovascular function. However, recovery quality was signi cantly better in the Med group. S. WRIGHT EVE Editorial Of ce References Dumoulin, M., Martens, A., Van F.

Routine cystoscopy was performedunder standing sedation during which the horse collapsedwith apparent seizure activity. General anaesthesia wasinduced and the horse recovered neurologically normal.Four days later, during a perineal urethrotomy procedure, thehorse experienced a similar collapse with seizure-likeactivity. General anaesthesia was again induced andcystoscopy performed through the urethrotomy incision. Aventral bladder mass was visualised and sampled.Cytology con rmed a neoplastic process and the horse was subjected to euthanasia. Histopathology con rmed transitional cell carcinoma. Air embolism was the suspectedcause of loss of consciousness and seizure activity in bothinstances. Case details History A 14-year-old Arabian gelding weighing 474 kg presented toa referral institution for evaluation of macroscopichaematuria of 7 weeks 'duration. The horse was evaluated by the referring veterinarian 2 weeks prior at which timethere were no abnormalities on physical examination andtransrectal palpation was unremarkable. A urinary catheterwas passed without dif culty and grossly normal urine was obtained for urinalysis. A complete blood count (CBC) andbiochemistry pro le were also performed. Biochemistry pro le was unremarkable and total protein concentration wasnormal (62 g/l). Complete blood count abnormalitiesincluded neutrophil numbers (2.71 9103cells/l) and lymphocytes at the low end of the normal range (1.80 9103cells/l). Absolute RBC number was decreased (6.36 9106cells/l). Packed cell volume was normal (34%). Urinalysis revealed a speci c gravity of 1.009 and trace blood, but was otherwise within normal limits. In the 2 weeks between referring veterinarianassessment and presentation to the referral centre, the haematuria increased in frequency and was noted during all phases of urination with blood clots being observed several times. Stranguria was noticed the day prior to presentation. On presentation, the horse was bright and alert with a normal rectal temperature (99.9 \u00b0F/37.7 \u00b0C), was tachypnoeic (60 breaths/min) and tachycardic (68 beats/min). The external appearance of the sheath and penis was normal. Complete blood count and biochemistry were not repeated. Packed cell volume was 20% and total protein42 g/l, which had decreased from 2 weeks prior. A voided midstream urine sample was grossly abnormal with a deep red-brown colour. Urinalysis revealed pH 8.5, urine speci c gravity 1.028, glucose 1 +, ketones 1 +, protein 3 +and red blood cells were too numerous to count. Bilirubin wasnegative, WBC numbers were within normal limits and nobacteria were seen. Cystoscopy The horse was sedated intravenously (i.v.) maleate (Acepromazine2, 20 mg, 0.05 mg/kg bwt) and placed in stocks. The urethral entrance was cleaned with Ivory soap and a 3 m flexible videoendoscope (Fujinon 11 mm) inserted into the urethra. Intermittent air insuf flation was used to distend the urethra and bladder. No urethral mucosal abnormalities were noted during advancement and the bladder was entered easily. The bladder was distended with air and contained red-coloured urine that was removed using suction and LRS (Lactated Ringers irrigation)3lavage. The dorsal bladder mucosa was normal in appearance and grossly normal urine was visualised entering the bladder from both the left and right ureters reducing the likelihood of the kidneys as the source of haematuria. After removal of all urine, a large blood clot could be seen on the ventral bladder floor. It appeared to be organised with large amounts of brin forming a scaffold-like appearance throughout the clot ( Fig 1 ). Small pieces of the blood clot were able to be removed with vigorous LRS3fluid lavage but were insuf cient to evaluate the ventral bladder mucosa. The decision was made to discontinue cystoscopy and perform a perineal urethrotomy (PU) to facilitate clot removal and biopsy acquisition the following day. As the endoscope was about to be removed, 30 min after commencing the procedure, the horse appeared to suddenly awaken from sedation, his head went from drooping to held high with a wide-eyed appearance. His eyes rotated dorsad until sclera was showing. This lasted about 25 s. All 4 limbs then began to move in an uncoordinated fashion and the horse collapsed into sternal followed by left lateral recumbency. All 4 limbs exhibited a flailing pattern and the horse appeared to lose consciousness for about 20 s. These signs were consistent with a generalised seizure. The horse was administered detomidine (Dormosedan1, 5 mg, 0.01 mg/kg bwt i.v.) and a 14 gauge catheter placed in the right jugular vein while the horse was in lateral recumbency. The horse appeared to be aware of his surroundings by this time. General anaesthesia was induced using xylazine 1 g, 2.1 mg/kg bwt) i.v. An emergency rescue glide was placed under the horse in lateral recumbency and he was moved to a padded surgical recovery stall. The horse recovered well and stood within 25 min, although was ataxic after initially standing with a signi cant head tremor and therefore additional xylazine was given (AnaSed4150 mg, 0.31 mg/kg bwt i.v.) and head tremor decreased. Two hours after full recovery a brief neurological examination was performed and no de cits noted. The horse was hospitalised through the weekend and treated with flunixin meglumine every 12 -24 h (Prevail5, 520 mg 1.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.) for anti-in flammatory purposes after falling in the stocks. He remained stable with haematuria observed each time the bladder was emptied. Perineal urethrotomy Four days later, a perineal urethrotomy was planned to allowmore direct access to the bladder for removal of the bloodclot and a representative biopsy to be obtained. The horsewas placed in stocks and sedated with an initial bolus ofdetomidine (Dormosedan 1, 5 mg, 0.01 mg/kg bwt i.v) and then maintained on a constant rate infusion of detomidine (34 mg Dormosedan1added to 500 ml LRS3). This was titrated to effect (0.4 -1.3 mg/h). A using (Morphine sulfate6, 50 mg, 0.1 mg/kg bwt) and a total of 2.5 mg detomidine (Dormosedan)1. Room temperature LRS3was used to make a total of 7 ml of fluid and this was administered into the caudal epidural space over 5 min. The rectum was evacuated and the tail secured out of the surgical eld. An approximately 30 930 cm area centred on the perineum in the dorsocaudal region of the hindlimbs was clipped and aseptically prepared with Betadine8scrub and 70% isopropyl alcohol5. Local anaesthetic subcutaneous tissue with 2% mepivacaine (Carbocaine)1 vertically for 10 cm over the perineal region on midlinestarting 4 cm distal to the anus and extending distally. Thepenis and prepuce were cleaned with warm water andsoap. A sterile urinary catheter was placed into the urethraretrograde from the tip of the penis to the bladder to assistwith locating the urethra during surgical dissection. Anapproximately 7 cm longitudinal skin incision was made onmidline with a No. 10 blade starting 4 cm distal to the anusand extending distally. The subcutaneous tissue and paired retractor penis muscles were separated on the midline using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection with Metzenbaum scissors. The bulbospongiosum muscle was incised on the midline with Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra was identi ed by palpation of the urinary catheter and secured between the surgeons 'ngertips and the corpus spongiosum penis surrounding the urethra and the urethra was incised with a No. 15 blade. The incision into the urethra was lengthened with Metzenbaum scissors to approximately 1.5 cm in length. At this point in the surgical procedure the urinary catheter was removed normograde from the urethra. As the tip of the catheter moved past the PU site a second episode occurred almost identical to the rst one. As before, the horse appeared suddenly awake, lifting his head and widening his eyes to show the sclera (lasting 45 -60 s) before becoming laterally recumbent with limbs flailing. A very brief period (<15 s) occurred where he appeared to lose consciousness. Venous blood gas drawn while the gelding was in lateral recumbency showed and bicarbonate were within normal limits. The detomidine1 CRI was bolused and again the horse anaesthetised(Zetamine 1.05 mg/kg bwt, Guaifenesin725 g, 52.7 mg/kg bwt) and transferred to the recovery stall where he was intubated and maintained under anaesthesia using inhalant (Iso flurane8in oxygen). A 1 m endoscope (Fujunon, 9.3 mm) was inserted through the PU site. The bladder was lavaged using LRS until the ventral wall could be visualised. The floor of the bladder was taken up by an irregular mass present on the ventral wall of the bladder interspersed with large areas of well adhered, organised blood clot. The mass was cauli flower-like in appearance. A wire snare and forceps were used to remove several small pieces of tissue from the mass via the endoscope. Cytology Impression smears were submitted for emergency cytology(Fig 2 ) while the horse was under general anaesthesia. Cytology showed the sample to be of increased cellularitywith a large number of cells found individually, in looseaggregates and cohesive clusters. Numerous criteria formalignancy were found in markedly atypical cells displayingcharacteristics of both a sarcoma (spindloid shape) andcarcinoma (cohesive clusters, nuclear moulding). Frequentbi- and multinucleation were observed as well as markedanisocytosis and anisokaryosis. De nitive diagnosis could not be made by cytology alone but the interpretation was thatthis was a neoplasm of moderate to marked malignancy. The horse was subjected to euthanasia (Beuthanasia i, 85 ml, 0.17 ml/kg bwt i.v.) while under anaesthesia by owner decision due to malignancy and poor prognosis. Histopathology The mass appeared to be on a short collagenous stalk withone surface covered by a thick plaque of polygonal cellswith several sites of incursion beyond the basementmembrane into the stroma. Anisocytosis and anisokaryosis ofthe proliferated cells was marked with 21 mitoses in ten 400 9 elds. There were numerous apoptotic cells and neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic in flammation throughout. A vessel adjacent to invasive cells was blocked by a brin thrombus Fig 1: The ventral surface of the bladder as seen on initial endoscopy. A large brin clot (A) can be seen ventrally, surrounded by red urine. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd237 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017and there were several other areas of suspected vascularinvasion. De nitive diagnosis of a transitional cell carcinoma, a rarely diagnosed neoplasm in equids, was made ( Fig 3 ). A full necropsy was not performed; however, the bladder was removed for inspection. The serosal surface of the bladder was grossly normal with no visible erythema or inltration. A large irregular mass was located on the ventral aspect of the bladder measuring 8 96 cm and raised 2 cm above the mucosa ( Fig 4 ). Discussion Venous air embolism is dif cult to de nitively diagnose, especially in large animal species. In human medicine, diagnosis is typically made based on a suggestive history such as central venous catheter placement and compatible clinical signs (Van Hulst et al. 2003). Despite widely available advanced imaging, clinical evaluation remains one of the preferred diagnostics (Elliott and Moon 1996; Van Hulst et al. 2003). Reported signs have included dysrhythmia, tachypnoea, tachycardia, pulmonary oedema, CNS signs of seizure, blindness and behaviour changes (Bradbury et al. 2005; Holbrook et 2009; Nolen- Walston 2014; Romagnoli et al. 2014). In order to contribute substantially to the equine literature with regards to VAE, suspected cases need to be de nitively diagnosed when suspected by practitioners. Diagnostic modalities utilised will depend on availability; however, as the majority of equine urinary tract endoscopy and perineal urethrotomies are performed in a referral setting, advanced equipment is generally available. A logical diagnostic approach during an episode would include physical examination assessing for presence of dysrhythmias, tachycardia, tachypnoea, pulmonary oedema, seizure and blindness (Adornato et et al. 2009; Dugdale 2011). Cardiac auscultation is critical and reported auscultatable abnormalities include a washing machine/water wheel murmur that occurs when air is trapped in the heart chambers, tachycardia, arrhythmia and atrial brillation (Mirski et al. 2007; Pellegrini-Masini Nolen-Walston 2014). This should be followed by electrocardiographic assessment to look for reported changes such as ST segment and T wave abnormalities, peaked P waves and ventricular premature complexes (Oppenheimer et al. 1953; Adornato et al. 1978; Gildenberg et al. 1981; Bradbury et al. 2005). When available, echocardiographic examination is appropriate to assess for the presence of gas within the chambers of the heart. In most nonobese horses it is simple to perform a cardiac ultrasound using a 5 MHz curvilinear abdominal probe. Transoesophageal echocardiography is thought to be the most sensitive VAE monitoring tool in human medicine and can detect microthrombi too small to cause clinical disease (Jaffe et al. 1995). Blood gas analysis should be performed early in the diagnostic process with particular attention to carbon dioxide concentration as discussed later. In cases where clinical examination suggests cerebral involvement, efforts should be made to document the presence of air within cerebral vessels. Appropriate diagnostics include computed tomography (CT) with i.v. contrast or magnetic resonance al. of an adult equine head is readily performed in many referral centres. A case of VAE following pneumocystography in a cat described radiographic evidence of air within the right ventricle, liver vasculature, urinary bladder, ureters and renal pelves (Thayer et al. 1980). An equine case described a 24 h post endoscopy ultrasound, which identi ed air within the ureters and renal pelvis of both kidneys (Romagnoli et al. 2014). Diagnosis post mortem is possible. Venous air embolism should ideally be suspected clinically in order to attempt to demonstrate air within the vasculature. As in premortem cases, imaging can be con rmatory and plain radiographs may be diagnostic in smaller cases to demonstrate air within the vasculature or within a chamber of the heart (Ackerman et al. 1972). Advanced imaging of the head such as CT or MRI may be diagnostic post mortem .

This will allow detection of bubbles escaping into the water to make a de nitive diagnosis. The heart should be examined for the presence of defects such as patent foramen ovale (Pham Dang et al. 2002; Mirski et al. 2007). Few diagnostics were done in this case due to the emergency nature of the episodes. The facial artery was palpated and the horse was no more tachycardic than on presentation. Venous blood gas drawn during the second episode was consistent with those reported in other cases of equine VAE (Nolen-Walston 2014; Romagnoli et al. 2014) where the results typically show changes consistent with hypoxaemia and reduced ventilation (Van Hulst et al. 2003; Mirski al. et End-tidal CO 2is monitored in man when VAE is a risk and a decrease can be an early indicator of air entering systemic circulation (Van Hulst et al. 2003; Mirski et al. 2007). Increased lactate is consistent with decreased peripheral perfusion or muscular activity during a seizure-like episode; however, with no presurgery lactate, it is hard to determine if this is secondary to anaemia or due to VAE. Similarly, whileelevated CO 2has been recognised in the VAE cases, it is hard to draw conclusions from a venous sample in a sedated horse, where PvCO 2would be expected to elevate (Nolen- Walston 2014). Treatment for VAE centres on preventing further air entrainment, decreasing volume of air already present in circulation and supporting the circulatory system (Mirski et al. 2007). Where signs of VAE are recognised clinically, there are several potential treatments in addition to supportive care. Early recognition is key and the risk of VAE needs to be considered in procedures where venous communication is possible (Ackerman et al. 1972). When signs begin, several reports recommend placing the case in left lateralrecumbency in order to relieve an air lock in the right side of the heart (Ackerman et al. 1972; Thayer et al. 1980; Mirski et al. 2007). This technique has been questioned by several authors as being ineffective in providing haemodynamic bene ts (Adornato et al. 1978; Geissler et al. 1997). The entry site should be eliminated and saline can be used to flood the area and stop further air entry (Mirski et al. 2007). Compression of both jugular veins may prevent further air entrainment when the site of entry is in the head (Iwabuchi et al. 1986). The case may be placed on a ventilator if necessary, or 100% O 2provided as it increases the rate at which the nitrogen in the bubble is absorbed, therefore decreasing bubble size (Thayer et al. 1980). Attempts may be made to aspirate air from the right atrium via central venous catheter; however, these are infrequently placed in veterinary medicine (Adornato et al. 1978; Muth and Shank 2000). Where available, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may speed reabsorption of the air bubbles by increasing the nitrogen partial pressure gradient across the alveolar gas exchange membrane (Muth and Shank 2000; Van Hulst et al. 2003). Kjeld et al. (2012) recommends that this is commenced within 6 h of VAE occurrence. Circulatory support is also vital in these cases to achieve normovolaemia, which may include pharmacological agents to increase cardiac output. Further treatment depends on the clinical presentation of the individual and can include seizure control, thiamine, vitamin, mannitol if there is concern for cerebral oedema, or furosemide where pulmonary oedema is present (Muth andShank 2000; Holbrook et al. 2007). Steroids were advocated in human medicine initially but are now no longer recommended (Dutka et al. 1992; Holbrook et al. 2007). The pathophysiological mechanism behind VAE has not been fully elucidated. A small amount of air is well tolerated intravascularly in horses and, in the authors 'experience, is a very common occurrence during jugular venous catheterisation. The factors leading to VAE becoming clinically relevant appear to relate to the volume of air aspirated into the vessel, location of the aspiration and speed at which it occurs (Adornato et al. 1978; Pellegrini- Masini et al. 2009; Nolen-Walston 2014). In dogs, the volume of rapidly injected air suf cient to cause death has been shown to be approximately 7.5 -15 ml/kg bwt (Oppenheimer et al. 1953; Adornato et al. 1978; Palmon et al. 1997; Mirski et al. 2007) and it has been reported that 0.25 ml/kg bwt air can be tolerated intravascularly in the horse before clinical signs become apparent (Bradbury et al. 2005; Dugdale 2011). It has been estimated that 100 ml/s of air could flow through a standard 14 gauge catheter supposing a 5 cm pressure gradient is present (Flanagan et al. 1969; Pellegrini- Masini et al. 2009). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain clinical signs. A large bolus of air, such as that aspirated through a 14 gauge jugular catheter, is thought to cause airlock of the right ventricle, effectively obstructing out flow and causing cardiovascular collapse (Palmon et al. 1997; Mirski et al. 2007; Nolen-Walston 2014). Decreased cardiac output could theoretically explain the clinical signs of tachycardia, tachypnoea and collapse. This was supported by radiographic evidence of air in a cat ventricle following pneumocystography (Thayer et al. 1980). Loss of consciousness and seizure-like activity observed twice in this case certainly suggest disruption to cerebral blood flow. Whether this occurred due to right ventricular Fig 4: Post mortem image of the mucosal surface of the ventral bladder. The 8 3632 cm raised irregular mass can be visualised. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd239 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017air-lock causing general cardiovascular collapse, or whetherair was able to enter cerebral arterial circulation isimpossible to de nitively determine. Air bubbles in the venous circulation eventually travel to the pulmonarycapillary bed where they are ltered (Presson et al. 1989; Palmon et al. 1997). When the volume of air exceeds the ltration capacity of this capillary bed, these bubbles can be shunted from the venous circulation to the arterial circulation in a phenomenon called paradoxical embolism (Harvey et al. 1996; Van Hulst et al. 2003; Nolen-Walston 2014). Air bubbles trapped in the pulmonary vasculature likely contribute to the pulmonary oedema observed in several equine cases of VAE (Van Hulst et al. 2003; Holbrook et al. 2007; Nolen-Walston 2014). In human medicine, patent foramen ovale (PFO) is recognised as a risk for paradoxical air embolism and is often screened for prior to surgical procedure in the sitting position (Pham Dang et al. 2002; Fathi et al. 2009). In cases with PFO, air is able to travel from the right atrium, through the foramen ovale into the leftatrium and from there into systemic circulation (Fathi et al. 2009; Dugdale 2011) as opposed to being ltered by the pulmonary circulation (Pellegrini-Masini et al. 2009). While common in man, these congenital cardiac defects are considered uncommon in horses (Patteson 1996). An important factor in determining whether air will enter circulation is the pressure difference between the vasculature and external environment (Adornato et al. 1978; Jaffe et al. 1995; Palmon et al. 1997; Nolen-Walston 2014). This is one reason why venous air embolism is more common than arterial embolism as an entry point. The higher pressures maintained in an artery make it dif cult for air to enter, even when it is pressurised during a diagnostic procedure. Horses with a lower venous pressure than normal are therefore at increased risk and the larger the pressure gradient difference, the greater the risk of VAE (Palmon et al. 1997; Romagnoli et al. 2014). There were several factors in this particular case that contributed to a lower venous pressure than normal and may have increased the risk of VAE. Both endoscopies were performed after i.v. sedation with detomidine and acepromazine. Both drugs are well recognised to cause hypotension (Plumb 2011). During the second procedure the horse was also sedated with a detomidine CRI, which has similar cardiopulmonary depressive effects. While this case did not appear clinically hypovolaemic, a signi cant drop in PCV/TP had occurred from 2 weeks prior (34%/62 g/l) to presentation (20%/42 g/l), suggesting blood loss had occurred. This was clinically supported by the macroscopic haematuria. Inadequate intravascular volume has been previously reported as a risk factor in the literature in man (Palmon et al. 1997). Similarities exist between this case and a case of fatal VAE in a cat undergoing pneumocystography (Thayer et al. 1980). This cat also presented with haematuria and on post mortem examination, evidence of acute haemorrhage and sloughed mucosa were present. In the case presented here, large blood clots were present, along with exposed vessels in the lightly papillated and highly vascular neoplastic mass. Histopathology of the mass showed neoplastic invasion into vessels, with one particular area having a vessel blocked byabrin thrombus. The high vascularity of the mass with exposed super cial vessels presents a viable mechanism for pressurised air to gain access to venous circulation,especially in a potentially hypotensive case. While the basic mechanism of VAE was likely the same in the second episode of collapse, it is unclear why the horse collapsed immediately after removal of the urethral catheter. It is possible draining the urine through the catheter led to intraluminal bladder pressure being lower than atmospheric pressure, allowing air to be rapidly drawn in through the PU site once the catheter no longer essentially plugged the entrance. The urinary catheter was in place and open to the environment for approximately 30 min prior to the collapse while the PU was performed. Air could fairly easily have been drawn into exposed vessels in the bladder. Alternatively, the timing may have been pure coincidence. While 2 cases are insuf cient to draw de nitive conclusions, it does suggest that air insuf flation during cystoscopy may be contraindicated in cases examined for haematuria. Fluid distension may be a safer alternative despite a decrease in visual clarity. Alternatively, Nolen-Walston (2014) suggests using carbon dioxide for insuf flation may lower the risk of VAE in cases such as severe cystitis or neoplasia with presence of haematuria. Carbon dioxide is absorbed and excreted more rapidly than room air. Care should also be exercised when performing a PU procedure in similar types of cases. This is potentially a complication and whilst rare, clients should be made aware of it prior to surgery. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

J. Bertone College of Veterinary Medicine, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California, USA. et al. (2017) is an elucidating report that identi es an adverse event likely occurring at a higher frequency than reported in the veterinary literature.The frequency of this adverse event may be quite high ifone considers the few times cystoscopy is performed andthe number of cases in this and other referencedpublications. Unfortunately, this author has experienced it in a gelding during endoscopy. Fortunately, the horse survived. At thattime, minimal veterinary literature was available, but theauthor identi ed references to air embolism in human cystoscopy which was helpful. The contribution of this case toclinical medicine is its reporting and excellent review andgathering of information in an education publication for all toconsider. We can only speculate that air embolism was thecause in this case. Its similarity to the human condition andother reported equine cases cannot be discarded andjudiciously we have to assume the authors 'assumptions are correct. So now, where does this leave us? In my opinion, weshould use a judicious approach when we perform procedureswith clear adverse consequences in human medicine andsurgery where reporting tends to be far more aggressive. The rest of my comments are speculative, but may have some value. Frank blood and bleeding in the lower urinarytract, aggressive bladder in flation, the choice of in flation gases, prolonged procedures and our dependence on alpha-2 sedation are logical risk factors. Intuitively, these may beadditive to increasing risk of air embolism during cystoscopy. Blood in the urinary tract Clearly there is a de cit in the blood -air barrier. In review, this is common to many of these cases. However, it is also themost common indication for equine cystoscopy. Judiciously,we should suspect that a breech in the blood -gas barrier would be additive to other risk factors listed below. Inflation pressure It is dif cult to know the degree of safe in flation, or make a judgement of overin flation during cystoscopy. Accommodation of the bladder under luminal pressure may hide degrees ofdangerous in flation especially with the use of alpha-2 agonists. Judicious and frequent (every 30 s) pressure releases may be warranted, especially when heavy blood is evident.Residual gas Residual gas may explain cases not immediate with theprocedure and occurring hours later. Possibly as sedationwears and muscle tone improves, the pressure within thebladder increases to the point where bladder lumen tosystemic gas absorption is accelerated. It therefore makessense to reduce residual gas as much as possible whenprocedures are completed. Inflation gases Possibly prolonged procedures warrant carbon dioxide orother similar gas in flation. The solubility and quick discharge may be useful in avoidance of air embolus. Procedure duration Long procedures may warrant interruption. This authorgenerally believes that procedures requiring more than15 min need to be rested and resumed later for a reasonableperiod of time. This becomes dif cult for all of us when trying to deal with a calculous or perform a biopsy. However, somepatience may be warranted. Sedation The haemodynamic effects of alpha-2 agonist drugs mayalso increase the risk of air embolus. Hypotension andbradycardia that occur could speculatively contribute to gasabsorption and risk.

Introduction A portosystemic shunt (PSS) is an abnormal venouscommunication between the intestinal portal circulation andthe systemic circulation, which bypasses the liver. Thecondition is well recognised and frequently diagnosed in catsand dogs et al. Santilli shunts can be congenital or acquired(secondary to chronic liver disease with portal hypertension). Insmall animals, congenital PSSs are typically single vessels thatconnect the vein to either the caudal common and the majority areoutside the hepatic parenchyma, described as extrahepaticshunts. A minority are partly or wholly within the liver and areknown as intrahepatic. Another variation is multiple small shuntswithin the liver parenchyma, described as microvasculardysplasia or portal vein hypoplasia (Berent et al. 2009). Individual case reports of equine PSS have been described (Buonanno et al. 1988; Lindsay et al. 1988; Hillyer et 1993; Fortier et al. 1996; Martens et al. 2009; Hug et al. 2012). There are 3 reports of successful surgical correction of PSSs (Fortier et al. 1996; Martens et al. 2009; Hug et al. 2012). One foal with an extrahepatic PSS was treated by surgical ligation via a paracostal approach (Fortier et al. 1996); a second foal also bytransvenous catheterisation and coil embolisation with an intrahepatic PSS by cellophane banding (Hug et al. 2012). A successful case of extrahepatic PSS occlusion during laparotomy is described inthis report.Case summary A 3-week-old American Miniature blue roan lly was presented to the referring veterinary surgeons. Clinical signs were rst noticed by the owners at age 1 week. Veterinary examinationat age 3 weeks revealed hypersalivation, trismus, poorappetite, and marked ataxia ( grade 4 /5). The right eye had a super cial corneal ulcer. Laboratory ndings showed decreased urea (1.8 mmol/l), and c-glutamyl transferase (194 iu/l). The white blood cell count was 23.5 910 9/l of which 84% were neutrophils. Serological testing for equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 was negative. The lly showed an intermittent improvement during the following 2 weeks whilst being treated with a combination of antibiotics, multivitamins, tetanus antitoxin, dexamethasone, methyl prednisolone acetate and intravenous dextrose fluids. The foal was age 5 weeks at referral hospital admission. Her bodyweight was 20 kg. She was dull, her heart rate was 96 beats/min, respiratory rate 68 breaths/min, and body temperature 35.0 \u00b0C. The foal was treated for hypovolaemic shock as detailed below, which resolved over 36 h, by which time she was reasonably bright and able to feed normally. During hospitalisation, the foal had persistent, albeit variable, neurological signs. Neurological examination showed hindlimb stiffness and hypermetria and there was ataxia in all 4 limbs. She was disorientated, walked into stationary objects and had dif culty locating her dam. There was no menace re flex and the pupillary light re flex was absent bilaterally. Occasional stertorous inspiratory and expiratory noises could be heard. An intermittent left sidedunilateral milk-like nasal discharge was seen. Four days after admission she showed tenesmus and constipation. The white cell count was 25.5 910 9/l of which 83% were neutrophils. The packed cell volume was 25% and the mean corpuscular volume 38.1 fl, indicating a microcytic anaemia. Forty-eight hours after admission the white cell count had reduced to 15.4 9109/l. Blood samples taken at this time showed low potassium 2.43 mmol/l and low calcium 2.70 mmol/l. Gamma-glutamyl transferase slightly elevated at aspartarte aminotransferase was 522 iu/l; \u00a92015 EDUCATION / AE / MAY acid concentration was 54.6 lmol/l (reference range <15lmol/l). Forty-eight hours after admission, access to peripheral venous blood ammonia testing became available and was 92.0 lmol/l (reference range 7.6 -63.2 lmol/l). A working diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was made and further diagnostics pursued. Ultrasonography was performed using an Esaote Technos MPX with a 5.5 -8.5 mHz microconvex at 8.5 mHz. The foal was positioned rstly in right lateral recumbency and scanned from just caudal to the xiphisternum, then in left lateral recumbency through the right dorsal caudal rib cage intercostally and the craniodorsal abdominal wall. The liver appeared reduced in size, measuring 2.3 cm across the body in transverse section and from the right dorsal abdomen the hepatic portal vein was identi ed coursing cranially with a diameter of 4.7 mm ( Fig 1 ). The caudal vena cava had a diameter of 13.3 mm ( Fig 2 ). An abnormal vessel was identi ed arising from the prehepatic portal vein, which looped dorsally and caudally to merge with the caudal vena cava near the right renal vein ( Fig 3 ). A diagnosis of a single extrahepatic portocaval shunt with microhepatica was made. Treatment Initial i.v. dextrose fluid therapy, nasal oxygen insuf flation and provision to improve the hypothermia for 36 h. Cefquinome (4.5 mg/kg mg/kg bwt, q. 24 h i.v.) were administered. Thirty-six hours after the onset of treatment, the lly was feeding regularly from the mare. The detection of hyperammonia prompted lactulose treatment (8 ml, q. 6 h per os ). Antibiotic treatment was changed to ampicillin (15 mg/kg bwt, q. 12 h i.m.) for 3 days due to swelling around the jugular venous catheter. On Day 4, omeprazole (4 mg/kg bwt, q. 24 h per os ) wasstarted. The corneal ulcer was treated with fusidic acid ointment twice daily. On Day 5, coagulation pro les were measured in anticipation of surgery and were within normal limits. Surgery was performed on Day 6. Premedication consisted of xylazine and maintained with iso fluorane at 1 -2% via an 8 mm cuffed endotracheal tube. Standard small animal instrumentation was used for surgery. In addition, a Balfour abdominal retractor and additional instruments for vascular surgery were used (notably ligature carrying forceps and a variety of Satinsky clamps).

A 6 cmabdominal midline incision was made caudal to theumbilicus to allow portovenography using a C-armfluoroscopy unit. Operative mesenteric portovenography was conducted as follows. A jejunal vein was catheterised using an 18 gaugecatheter. The catheter was then secured ( Fig 4 ) and a short extension line attached. The foal was moved to lateralrecumbency and 25 ml of iohexol (647 g/l) was drawn upinto a syringe. The C-arm was centred over the cranialabdomen, the contrast was injected through the extensionline as fluoroscopy was performed (15 ml of the contrast was used). A single extrahepatic PSS was identi ed fluoroscopically opacifying cannulated hepatic portal caudal origin of the shunt, the portal vein wasmarkedly reduced in diameter. A ventrodorsal fluoroscopic image was also taken ( Fig 6 ). The foal was returned to dorsal recumbency and the midline incision extended. The duodenum was identi ed together with the visceral surface of the right lobe of the liver. The mesoduodenum was explored in this space but the shunt was not identi ed. The duodenum was then laid against the visceral surface of the right lobe of the liver and the mesoduodenum and the mesocolon adjacent to the right lobe of the pancreas were dissected and the shunt identi ed (Fig 7 ), which was 2 -2.5 cm in diameter. This vessel was visibly larger than any other adjacent vein. The shunt was isolated by blunt dissection and ligature carrying forceps with 4 metric silk in place, was used to encircle the shunt. The catheter sheath was used to temporarily act as a Rummel tourniquet (Fig 8 ). The Rummel tourniquet was tightened and the small intestine and pancreas were observed for congestion (an indicator of portal hypertension) but congestion of these viscera were not observed. A further 10 -15 ml bolus of contrast was introduced into the cannulated mesojejunal vein for lateral and ventrodorsal portovenograms with the shunt both occluded and patent and this demonstrated cessation of the portocaval communication, absence of further shunts, increased bloodflow to the liver parenchyma and opening of a major branch of the hepatic portal vein. Post occlusion, the shunting vessel now appeared truncated, and contrast was seen flowing through the hepatic portal vein with arborisation into the liver Fig 4: Laparotomy view showing catheter secured in jejunal vein with extension set attached.

The shunt ligature was tied ( Fig 10 ). A 3 metric polysorb mattress suture was placed around themesojejunal vein as the catheter was withdrawn. Directmean arterial blood pressure was stable through surgery at55-75 mmHg but 5 min after ligation of the shunt (75 min after induction) it increased to 95 mmHg; however, 5 min later it returned to preligation levels. A fracture suture biopsy of the left hepatic lobe was obtained. The abdomen was closed in routine fashion. The foal stood 20 min after the conclusion of surgery. The section of liver biopsied during surgery revealed the presence of diffuse, microvesicular hepatocyte vacuolation with small portal areas comprising proliferating indistinct venous structure consistent with congenital portosystemic shunt formation. Post operatively, the lly was supported with 4% glucose saline intravenously for 36 hours. The foal was largely off suckfor 24 h but would drink small quantities from a bowl. Twenty- four hours after surgery she returned to feeding normally from the mare. She received morphine (0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.) 4 h post operatively, ampicillin (15 mg/kg bwt, q. 12 h i.m.) for 2 days and then benzylpenicillin (10 mg/kg bwt, q. 8 h i.v.) for 5 bwt, q. 8 h ) for 5 days and omeprazole (4 mg/kg bwt, q. 24 h per os ).

The mare and foal were discharged 6 days post operatively with advice to start turnout 6 weeks later. Therewere no complications subsequent to hospital discharge. Outcome The lly was followed until she was just over 3 years old at which point she was subjected to euthanasia due to severe abdominal pain. A post mortem examination was not performed. The foal had grown to normal size and had shown no clinical disease. She had enjoyed a very successful show career. The owner considered the procedure successful. The mare produced 2 normal colts subsequent to this lly by the same sire and a normal lly by a different sire. Discussion A multidisciplinary approach was crucial to the success of thiscase. Portosystemic shunt is seen more commonly in dogsand cats, so small animal surgeons and radiologists haveinvaluable experience on which to draw. Typical clinical ndings in foals and other species with PSSs are congenital circling,ptyalism, central anaemia, microcytosis, raised serum ammonia and bile acids, reduced urea, plasma protein and albumin (Hug et al. 2012). Intraoperative location of the PSS is achieved by evaluation of the fluoroscopic images, which allows the surgeon to target the visual inspection of the abdomen in order to locate the portocaval shunt. If the prehepatic caudal vena cava can be inspected, the shunt is seen as a large vessel entering it caudal to the liver, but note that the renal veins also enter here. In other instances, the surgeon examines the mesoduodenum, mesocolon and both the lesser and greater curvatures of the stomach to identify anyunexpectedly large venous structures. The vessel is then isolated, a temporary closure performed (Rummel tourniquet) and the portovenography repeated to con rm closure and to be sure that no other shunt is present (Berent et al. 2009). In dogs and cats, extrahepatic shunts are routinely closed in a similar fashion to that described here, with immediate closure by ligation if portal hypertension does not develop or by partial occlusion or gradual occlusion if necessary (e.g. the placement of an ameroid constrictor or cellophane band). Intrahepatic shunts (shunts that are partially or completely within the hepatic parenchyma) are occasionally amenable to similar techniques if dissection around them is practical. When this is not possible, intravascular surgery (opening the portal vein after temporary occlusion of the portal vein and caudal vena cava ) or transvascular approaches (interventional radiology) are utilised (Tobias 2003). The authors are unaware of reports of these techniques in the horse. Acute shunt closure as performed in this foal, is not always possible in dogs as it may induce life -threatening portal hypertension. Methods to achieve gradual shunt closure using cellophane bands (Hunt et al. 2004) or ameroid constrictors (Mehl et al. 2005) have been investigated. However, thesemay lead to partial closure causing persistence of clinical signs. The cellophane band technique was used successfully in a foal (Hug et al. 2012); however, ammonia and bile acids both fell quickly after surgery, suggesting that this procedure resulted in acute closure of the PSS but without any deleterious effect on the foal. Two transvascular procedures have also been described in dogs typically with intrahepatic shunts: coil embolisation (Bussadori et al. 2008) and occluder devices (Hogan et al. 2010), which also act to close the shunt more gradually. Coils carry the risk of migration to the heart and lungs. Occluder devices have less of a tendency to migrate but result in a more acute closure (Hug et al. 2012). Coil embolisation was successfully used in a foal by Martens et al. (2009). The technique that we used was the routine approach that the small animal surgeons favoured in our hospital. The authors are not aware of reported acceptable portal vein pressures in the horse. In the dog, it is reported that after ligation, a portal vein pressure of <24 cm H 2O should be achieved (with a higher pressure requiring partial rather than full ligation). However, portal pressure measurement is somewhat imprecise and is not routinely performed in veterinary surgery. It is accepted that visual inspection of the viscera is an equally acceptable indication of portal hypertension, with the absence of intestinal or pancreatic congestion indicating acceptable pressure post occlusion (Tobias 2003). Computed tomography angiography has replaced portovenography in human patients (Hensler et al. 2001) and has also been shown to be accurate in dogs (Frank et al. 2003) but was not diagnostic in one equine PSS (Hug et al. 2012) due to breathing motion artefacts. This facility was not available for this foal. Additionally, although this is useful to determine the anatomy of the PSS, a second procedure (exploratory surgery or an interventional transvascular approach) is required for PSS closure. Transrectal scintigraphy is also described (Samii 2001) but provides limited anatomical characterisation. Percutaneous transsplenic injection of agitated saline and simultaneous echocardiography of the right cardiac chambers was used in one case and was considered diagnostic for the presence of a PSS (Hug et al. 2012). A result is considered positive if the agitated saline is seen immediately within the right cardiac chambers. Gomez- Ochoa et al. (2011) mapped the microbubbles within the portal vein, the PSS, the hepatic veins and the caudal h i.v.) improved clinical signs in a foal (Hug et al. 2012). It has been used previously in canine cases of chronic hepatoencephalopathy (Meyer et al. 1998). Its main equine indication maybe stabilisation, whilst the foal undergoes diagnostic investigation and surgical planning. Lactulose (which reduces the amount of ammonia absorbed from the intestinal tract), metronidazole and penicillin/neomycin, were given to one foal, and this regime resolved the clinical signs including blindness, and returned blood ammonia concentration to normal within 3 days (Martens et al. 2009). A ventral midline approach was very effective in this 20 kg foal but consideration of the right paracostal approach(Fortier et al. 1996) should be given for larger equids. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd247 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / 2017Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

GEQ-00180Clinical Commentary Portosystemic shunts: A diagnostic challenge J. R. Gold Department of Clinical Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, USA. this issue by Woodford et al . (2017) describes the surgical management of an extrahepatic portosystemic shunt in a 5-week old miniature foal. Only a handful of reports exist in the literature describing surgical procedures for repair of these congenital abnormalities in foals. One of the important aspects of the accompanying case report was the multidisciplinary approach taken in handling, imaging and surgical repair of the extrahepatic shunt. Small animal internal medicine specialists and surgeons diagnose portosystemic shunts much more frequently than equine veterinarians, regardless of whether they are general practitioners or specialists. It is therefore important to work as a team with small and large animalpractitioners. The case described by Woodford et al. (2017) had a positive outcome. Introduction Congenital portosystemic shunts are anomalous intra- orextrahepatic vessels that bypass the liver and drain directlyinto the systemic circulation. In the fetus, the ductus venosusis a shunt that exists with the purpose of bringing oxygen andnutrients from the umbilical circulation to the heart andbypassing the liver. The ductus venosus typically closes at, orshortly after, birth. In the adult, extrahepatic shunts connectthe with the Portosystemic shunts result in abnormal nutrient metabolism, failure of blood to be detoxi ed by the liver and abnormal ammonia metabolism. Portosystemic shunts can be either extra- or intrahepatic. The majority of portosystemic shunts previously noted in dogs and cats are extrahepatic, although intrahepatic shunts have also been reported to occur (Ewing et al. 1974; Center and Magne 1990; Birchard and 2007; et al. 2010; 2011). In foals, both intra- and extrahepatic shunts have been described, with only a small number surviving after surgical intervention (Buonanno et al. 1988; Hillyer et al. 1993; Fortier et al. 1996; Martens et al. 2009; Hug et al. 2012). Clinical signs Clinical signs associated with portosystemic shunts include thecentral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract as well as failureto thrive. Seizures, abnormal mentation, head pressing,obtundation, ataxia and cortical have beenpreviously reported as well as diarrhoea, constipation andtenesmus. Alterations in growth have also been describedsuch as poor growth, small for age or breed. The clinical signs listed have been well de ned in dogs and cats and have been reported in foals, calves and a camelid (Beech et al. 1977; Keane and Blackwell 1983; Fortier et al. 1996; Ivany et al. 2002). Diagnosis The diagnosis of portosystemic shunts can be particularlychallenging in horses due to the vague clinical signs andrarity of the condition. More common neurological or hepaticdisease differentials are usually considered before thediagnosis of a portosystemic shunt is made. This is in contrastto cats and dogs where portosystemic shunts are seenfrequently enough to rule them out as a diagnosis for anyyoung dog or cat with clinical signs of neurological diseaseand history of poor growth (Ivany et al. 2002). Presumptive diagnosis of portosystemic shunts can be made using serumbile acid and blood ammonia concentrations (Keane andBlackwell 1983; Center al. 1985; 1988; Hillyer et Johnson 1995). De nitive diagnosis of portosystemic shunts has been previously described in case report by Woodford et al. (2017) (Keane and Blackwell 1983; Wrigley 1987; al. 1996; Frank et al. 2003; Hug et al. 2012). Human patients with portosystemic shunts typically use computed tomography angiography(Hensler et al. 2001; Timparnaro et al. 2015) over portovenography and it appears to be accurate in dogs (Frank et al. 2003). In the article by Hug et al. (2012) computed tomography was unable to make an accurate diagnosis of an intrahepatic shunt due to a breathing artifact. However, advancements in computed tomography may still make this the tool of choice for diagnosis of portosystemic shunts in foals. Treatment It has been previously reported that cats with long-termmedical management have poor outcomes (Scavelli et al. 1986; Blaxter et al. 1988). Dogs managed with long-term medical treatment do well and can be used as a rst line option (Greenhalgh et al. 2010). Medical treatment in dogs typically consists of dietary management with high quality digestible protein in frequent small meals, antimicrobials EDUCATION AE / MAY 2017decrease ammonia concentrations. Treatment with long-termmedical management has not been previously reportedin foals. However, foals are typically treated with short-term medical management prior to surgery. Medicalmanagement in foals is similar to dogs with the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and metronidazole, anti-in flammatory agents, lactulose and intravenous fluids. Various surgical techniques have been previously utilised in small animals including ameroid constrictors, cellophane bands 2003; Lipscomb al. 2007). Cellophane bands and ameroid constrictors are utilised to slowly compress the shunt when portal hypertension needs to be prevented. In foals, only one successful surgical intervention has been reported using cellophane banding for an intrahepatic shunt (Hug et al. 2012). Three successful surgical corrections of extrahepatic shunts in foals have been described in the literature, with transvenous coil embolisation (McCornico et al. 1997; Martens et al. 2009) and one with surgical ligation (Fortier et al. 1996). The case report by Woodford et al. (2017) discussed the use of a ligature to surgically correct an extrahepatic shunt. Since the foal was a miniature horse and 20 kg, the technique similar to dogs and cats could be utilised including a ventral midline approach. They were also able to utilise the expertise of their small animal colleagues in deciding how to approach the case. Overall, it appears that surgical technique to correct portosystemic shunts depends upon the type of shunt, prevention of portal hypertension and personal preference of the surgeon. Summary In summary, portosystemic shunts tend to be a rareoccurrence in foals. However, the condition should beconsidered if a foal presents with central nervous system andgastrointestinal clinical signs along with poor growth.Diagnosis should be made using a combination of athorough history, clinical signs and laboratory concentrationsof serum bile acids and blood ammonia, along withdiagnostic imaging angiography or portography. Treatmentconsists of medical management with the goal to lowerammonia levels and stabilisation of the patient until surgerycan be performed. With advances in diagnostic imaging andcollaborative efforts of veterinarians, successful surgicalmanagement of Portosystemic shunts in foals is possible.

Bettschart-Wolfensberger\u00b6and K\u20acummerle* Clinic of Equine Surgery, Equine Hospital, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Switzerland;Clinic of Diagnostic Imaging, Equine Hospital, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Switzerland;\u00a7Institute of Veterinary Pathology, Equine Hospital, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of and\u00b6Section of distal metaphysis of the right tibia. A transcortical surgical approach was used to curette the lesion and ll it with an autologous bone graft and a calcium phosphate bone substitute material. Histopathology revealed mild histiocytic in flammatory changes, mild brosis and bone necrosis. This case report describes an unusual cyst-like lesion in the tibial metaphysis of a horse. Introduction Subchondral cystic lesions are well described entities in thehorse (Rechenberg et al. 1998). They can occur due to osteochondrosis or secondary to an osteochondroarticular defect (Jeffcott and Kold 1982) and are most frequently diagnosed in the medial femoral condyle and phalanges. Radiographically, they appear as a radiolucent area involving the subchondral bone that is commonly surrounded by a thin, well demarcated, sclerotic rim (Rechenberg et al. 1998). In man, other cystic bone lesions with similar pathologies have been described. These include unicameral bone such as osteoma or ossifying broma (Thompson and Pool 2002) and bone infarction (Munk et al. 1989; Umans et al. 2000) may resemble cystic lesions. In the horse, these differential diagnoses have rarely been reported. There are single case reports describing ABC in the mandible (Lamb and Schelling 1989) or at multiple locations in the tibia and third metacarpal and metatarsal bones (Steiner and Rendano 1982; Thomas et al. 1997), FD in the maxillary sinus (Jacobson 1971), the nasal cavity (Livesey et al. 1984) or the accessory carpal bone (Jones and Patterson-Kane 2004) and NOF in the distal phalanges (Attenburrow and Heyse-Moore 1982) and the proximal tibiae (Kidd and Bradshaw 2002) in predominantly young equine patients. Bone infarction has rarely been reported in the equine literature (Fenger et al. 1993; Martig et al. 2008; S/C19anchez et al. 2010). This case report describes an unusual cyst-like bone lesion in the metaphysis of the tibia in a horse.Case history A 6-year-old Ha flinger gelding, used for pleasure riding, with a bodyweight of 525 kg was presented to the Iffezheim EquineHospital, Germany, with a history of right hindlimb lameness of4 weeks 'duration. The referring veterinarian had performed diagnostic anaesthesia and a radiographic examination ofthe complete limb 2 weeks previously without any abnormalndings. Clinical ndings At clinical examination, the horse was sound at walk but hada 1/5 right hindlimb lameness (Ross and Dyson 2010) at thetrot. No other abnormal ndings were detected. Due to the mild degree of lameness and uncooperative behaviour of the horse, diagnostic anaesthesia was not performed. Diagnostic imaging Nuclear scintigraphy (MIE, Scintron)1was performed and in the bone phase, a marked focal increase of radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the distal part of the right tibia. Radiographically, there was a subtle radiolucent area in the distal metaphysis of the right tibia (Fig 1 ). Radiological diagnosis was consistent with a cyst-like lesion. The horse was then treated with a single intravenous (i.v.) infusion of tiludronic acid (Tildren, 500 mg), calcium- dobesilate (Doxium 500, 1500 mg per os b.i.d.) for 30 days and phenylbutazone (Equipalazone, 1.9 mg/kg bwt per os b.i.d.) for 8 days. The owner was instructed to hand walk the horse for 8 weeks. The horse was sound for 9 weeks but the lameness recurred when trotting exercise was reintroduced. Three months after scintigraphic examination, radiographic examinations were repeated at the Iffezheim Equine Hospital,Germany. Radiographically, a large oval, mildly radiolucent area was seen in the cancellous bone of the distal metaphysis of the right tibia. This radiolucent area had a heterogeneous, coarse trabecular pattern in its centre and was surrounded by a marked irregular sclerotic rim. The subchondral bone of the distal tibia appeared thickened but otherwise normal (Fig 2 ). For the CT scan and subsequent surgery the horse was referred to the Equine Hospital of the University of Zurich, Switzerland. Preoperatively, the gelding was premedicated with the right distal tibia. The lesion had a size of 4.4 94.492.8 cm and did not involve the cortices or the subchondral bone of the distal tibia ( Fig 3 ). In its centre, coarse trabecular bone was identi ed. A similar but much smaller lesion was detected medially in the proximalmetaphysis of the right metatarsal bone. Radiographicand CT ndings were suggestive of cyst-like lesions in the right tibia and third metatarsal bone. A metallic skin staple was placed under CT guidance to mark an appropriate site for a transcortical surgical approachto the lesion. Surgical procedure Subsequent to CT, the horse was transferred to the operatingtheatre to perform surgery in right lateral recumbency. The right limb and the left tuber coxae were clipped and prepared aseptically. A 2 cm skin incision was made over the medial aspect of the right tibia where the metallic marker had been placed.Sharp dissection was performed through the periosteum. A medial transcortical approach to the cystic lesion was performed using a 4.5 mm diameter drill bit followed by a 6 mm diameter drill. A Michele trephine was used to obtain a bone biopsy from the lesion. The cyst was debrided using Spratt curettes. It was noted that the cyst contained dense, bone-like material. Curetted material was also submitted for histopathological examination. The cystic cavity was lled with an autologous bone graft obtained from the left tuber coxae and a b-tricalciumphosphate bone substitute material (chronOS Granules 1.4 -2.8 mm, 25 cc, b-TCP) 3. The approaches to the tibia and tuber coxae were both closed with simple continuous sutures of the subcutaneous tissue followed by simple interrupted skin sutures. Finally, a stent bandage was applied to the tuber coxae and a full limb bandage applied to the right hindlimb. Assisted recovery from general anaesthesia was performed using head and tail ropes and recovery was uneventful. Outcome After surgery, phenylbutazone (Equipalazone, 1.9 mg/kg bwtper os s.i.d) administration was continued for 6 days and the horse kept cross-tied in the box. The keep it less fractious while tied in the box. Two days post operatively, follow-up radiographs demonstrated that the lateral part of the cyst was not lled with bone substitute material. Therefore, a second surgicalprocedure under general anaesthesia was performed 7 daysafter the rst surgery. Perioperative management and anaesthetic protocol were identical to the rst procedure. The horse was positioned in left lateral recumbency and alateral transcortical approach to the lesion was performed.Hypodermic needles and radiographic control were used todelineate the whole extent of the remaining part of the cystic Fig 1: Dorsolateral-plantaromedial oblique radiographic view of the right tibia obtained at initial clinical presentation.

This part was curetted and lled with the same bone substitute material as used in the rst surgical procedure but without an autologous bone graft. Closure of the surgicalincision was performed as described above. Phenylbutazone (Equipalazone, 1.9 mg/kg bwt per os s.i.d.) administration 1%, during hospitalisation. The horse was kept cross-tied for 36 days after the secondsurgery. Radiographs obtained 2 days after the second surgery con rmed that the cystic lesion was completely lled with bone substitute material. Sutures were removed 14 days after each surgery. No short-term complications occurred. The horse was comfortable in the box and sound at the walkthroughout the period of hospitalisation. On follow-up radiographs 55 days after the second surgery, opacity in the centre of the lesion had increased subjectively ( Fig 4 ) and mild new bone formation was seen at the sites of the transcortical approaches. At this time, thehorse was discharged from the hospital. The owner was instructed to keep the horse in a box with a small pasture and perform daily hand walking for 3 monthsfollowed by a gradual increase in exercise.A follow-up examination was performed 6 months post operatively. The horse was sound at walk and trot and radiographs revealed progressive remodelling of the bone substitute material in the former lesion ( Fig 5 ). Nine months after surgery, the owner reported that she could ride the horse at all paces without signs of lameness. Histology The biopsy obtained with the Michele trephine revealedpredominantly normal lamellar bone with areas of compactcortical bone and adjacent cancellous bone consisting ofbroad trabecules with mature fatty tissue that containedmultifocally moderate numbers of macrophages and singleneutrophils as well as mildly increased numbers ofbroblasts. The material debrided from the lesion consisted of predominantly normal lamellar bone and fatty tissueinterspersed with small to moderate numbers ofmacrophages, some conglomerates of neutrophils and smallareas of brous tissue. Special stainings for bacteria were negative in both locations. Both samples contained smallareas of necrotic bone characterised by hypereosinophilicbone with empty lacunae bordered by more basophiliclamellar bone ( Fig 6 ). a) b) c) Fig 3: Computed tomography study of the right tibia prior to surgery. a) The transverse plane shows the large dimension of the cystic lesion at the level of the skin staple set to mark the medial surgical approach, b) sagittal plane: the coarse trabecular structure of thecyst is visible and c) dorsal plane: the thick sclerotic rim can be differentiated cortex and subchondral bone. \u00a92015 EVJ MAY 2017The histological diagnosis was well differentiated lamellar bone with low grade histiocytic in flammation, mild brosis and evidence of bone necrosis. Discussion This case report describes an unusual cyst-like lesion in ahorse. Its main features were development of ascintigraphically active area in the distal tibial metaphysiswithout radiographic abnormalities a few weeks after onsetof lameness, followed by development of a clearradiographic lesion surrounded by a thick, irregular scleroticrim 3 months later, accompanied by intermittent lameness. Tothe best of our knowledge, such a cyst-like lesion in a horsehas not been previously described. Differential diagnoses include unicameral bone and IOG are not reported in the equine literature whereas single cases of ABC, NOF, FD and bone infarction have been described in horses. In human medicine, UBCs appear radiographically as intramedullary radiolucent areas surrounded by a thin sclerotic rim and thinning of the adjacent cortex. They are normally lled with clear serous to blood-tinged fluid and amorphous cementum-like tissue. The cystic wall is lined by a thin brous membrane. Histologically, these cysts contain clusters of giant cells and, in cases with secondary fractures, also haemosiderin-containing macrophages (Remotti and Feldman 2012). The single cases of ABCs described in horses correspond to the speci cation in man (Remotti and Feldman 2012). Multinucleated giant cells, haemosiderophages and reactive broblasts are commonly seen histologically and clearradiolucent areas within the bone spongin represent the of al. 1999; Ordidge 2001). Fig 5: Dorsolateral-plantaromedial oblique radiographic view of the right tibia obtained at follow-up examination 6 months after surgery. The transcortical approaches are fully healed by newbone formation. Fig 4: Dorsolateral-plantaromedial oblique radiographic view ofthe right tibia obtained 55 days after the second surgicalprocedure. The cyst is completely lled with the b-tricalciumphosphate granules.

A small 320. \u00a92015 / AE / MAY 2017Typical features of an IOG in man include a brous membrane lining the cystic wall and broblasts embedded in a myxoid and mucin matrix. A round radiolucent lesion with a sharp sclerotic rim located very close to the articular surface characterises its radiographic appearance. This kind of cystic lesion resembles the subchondral bone lesion in horses and is also seen secondary to degenerative bone disease in man (Remotti and Feldman 2012). Nonossifying broma in the horse has been reported only in one case (Attenburrow and Heyse-Moore 1982). Radiographically, this lesion presented as a well de ned radiolucent centre with a thin sclerotic rim and containedhomogenous soft tan to greyish brous tissue and broblasts present in large amounts beside multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells and lymphocytes. Within the lesionare haemorrhagic foci andcontent of broblasts in large amounts and osteoclast-like giant cells are also represented in the case described byAttenburrow and Heyse-Moore (1982). The radiographic appearance of FD in man is characterised by an expansile and intramedullaryradiolucency that may be eccentric or involve the entirewidth of the bone accompanied by a rim of reactive bone(Fitzpatrick et al. 2004; Remotti and Feldman 2012). Jones and Patterson-Kane (2004) described FD in a horse as aradiolucent area that occupied approximately 75% of theproximal aspect of the accessory carpal bone with anirregular and remodelled proximal margin adjacent to thelytic area. However, free fluid within the lesion as described in the literature in man (Remotti and Feldman 2012) was notfound in the carpal bone, which was of rm and gritty tissue that could be cut with a scalpel. Histologically, the bro- osseous connective tissue contains irregular woven osteoid trabeculae. The typical osteoblastic rimming of the normal bone surface is lacking in FD (Jones and Patterson-Kane 2004; Remotti and Feldman 2012). There is no convincing analogy of the ndings present in our case with any of these differential diagnoses. It is obvious that due to its metaphyseal location this lesion does not correspond to the typical appearance of a subchondral cystic lesion (SCL). Subchondral cystic lesions occur commonly in horses but are typically lled with myxomatous tissue, which was not the case in our patient. However, it was suggested that SCLs could also be located in the metaphysis (Auer and Rechenberg 2012). Low grade histiocytic and mildly neutrophilic in flammation with mild brosis were the main histopathological ndings in the patient described in this report. Additionally, focal areas of bone necrosis were present and suggested bone infarction as a further differential diagnosis. Interestingly, the tibia was involved in all case reports of equine bone infarction (Fenger et al. 1993; Martig et al. 2008; S/C19anchez et al. 2010). Radiographic changes included areas of patchy sclerosis (Fenger et al. 1993), indistinct areas of increased bone opacity between areas of decreased opacity (Martig et al. 2008) or an irregular but well demarcated radiolucent zone within the distal metaphysis without a sclerotic rim of the tibia (S /C19anchez et al. 2010). Different radiographic appearances of bone infarctions canbe explained by temporal progression. While mature bone infarcts typically appear as a densely calci ed region in themedullary cavity surrounding a central radiolucent area, early stages appear radiographically nonspeci c and include only mottled bone rare cation, sometimes with mild reactive sclerosis (Munk et al. 1989). Other histopathological characteristics of bone infarctions, such as soft consistency of the material within the lesion, necrosis of adipocytes with saponi cation, areas of haemorrhage and giant cells containing foreign material, found in the cases described in the literature (Fenger et al. 1993; Martig et al. 2008; S /C19anchez et al. 2010) were absent in our case. However, these differences might be due to the chronicity of the lesion and the histiocytic in flammation and mild brosis might be interpreted potentially as chronic healing process. Alternatively, it can be speculated if a local in flammatory process of unknown origin was the reason for the bone necrosis and cyst formation. Surgical debridement and lling with a bone graft and a bone substitute material was performed, despite the lack of a clear diagnosis for the following reasons: a) debridement is the treatment of choice for the most similar condition in equine orthopaedics, i.e. subchondral bone cysts and b) debridement and lling with a bone graft or bone substitute material is the treatment of choice in human medicine for most conditions relevant as differential diagnoses, i.e. UBC, ABC and extensive forms of NOF and FD (Remotti and Feldman 2012). Moreover, lling of the SCL in horses with the b-tricalciumphosphate graft has already been successfully used in horses (F \u20acurstet al. 1997; Auer et al. 2001; Deiss et al. 2001). The use of autologous bone graft from the tuber coxae is an alternative procedure in equine surgery (Auer 1999; McDuffee and Anderson 2003). It is known from other species that b-tricalciumphosphate granules are biocompatible and osteoconductive (Van Lieshout et al. 2011). They show degradation and are replaced by newly formed bone over 6-18 months after implantation (Buser et al. 1998; Steffen et al. 2001). A combination of b-tricalciumphosphate granules and autologous bone marrow can also be used to ll benign cystic bone lesions in man. It was found that this combination was superior to the use of b-tricalciumphosphate granules alone in terms of prevention of recurrence or persistent pain (Ondru /C20set al. 2011). The main risk of surgical intervention by transcortical debridement is weakening of the bone and catastrophic fracture. The capability of a bone to resist torsional loading after creation of a cortical defect is in fluenced by several factors such as cross-sectional geometry (Burstein et al. 1972), bone quality, thickness, cortical circumference (Frankel and Burstein 1968; Edgerton et al. 1990; Rosson and Shearer 1991), distribution of material properties within the cortices, rate of loading and the size of the defect (Chrisman and Snook 1968; Burstein et al. 1972; Clark et al. 1977). The transcortical drilling holes in our patient had a diameter of 6 mm and the craniocaudal diameter of the tibia at this location was 38 mm as measured on CT images. This corresponded to a defect size of 16% of the tibial diameter at each location. In fact, the cortical holes were even larger than 6 mm in diameter due to marginal bone loss when curettage was performed. While many studies showed a decrease in bone strength with increasing size of a cortical defect (Brooks et al. 1970; Clark et al. 1977; Edgerton et al. 1990; Hipp et al. 1990; Ho et al. 2010), an experimental study using circular, unicortical defects in ovine femora speci cally demonstrated the the \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd256 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017bone when defects were 10 to 20% of bone diameter(Edgerton et al. 1990). In an equine study, bicortical defects of 22 or 33% of bone diameter in third metatarsal bonesresulted in diminished torsional failure strength of 13 or 22%,respectively (Seltzer et al. 1996). Therefore, relevant decrease in torsional strength associated with creation of thetranscortical holes was assumed in our patient. For thisreason, assisted recovery was performed and the horse keptcross-tied for a considerable time. No complications occurredand progressive healing of the transcortical approaches wasdocumented on follow-up radiographs. An alternative tocross-tying is the use of a full body support sling-system toprevent the horse from lying down (F \u20acurst et al. 2008). However, such a sling was not used because of concernsassociated with the excitable nature of this patient. There are still some unanswered questions. A speci c diagnosis could not be made in our patient. The conditiondescribed here may represent an unreported disease. Itcould also be that the development of the condition mighthave been associated with with indistinct histopathologicalndings or the lesions detected at the time of histological examination might just represent a nonspeci c healing stage, not allowing a speci c aetiological diagnosis. Alternatively, the small specimens obtained for histopathological examination might not have fully represented the main lesion. Furthermore, it is possible that diseases well described in other species are rarely seen in horses and that histopathological features show variations between species.The dif culties in obtaining a diagnosis is in accordance with the experiences of other authors who suggest a close connection between FD, ossifying broma and osteoma (Thompson and Pool 2002) and report of diagnostic limitations in histopathological examination (Attenburrow and Heyse- Moore 1982).

Stancari, B. Conturba, S. Roncon\u00a7, E. Ferro, M. Gualtieriand F. Ferrucci* Department of Health, Animal Science and Food /C18a degli Studi di Milano, stricture is an uncommon condition in horsesthat results in an obstructive syndrome with regurgitation offood and possible aspiration pneumonia. Currently, in bothhuman and small animal practice, one of the preferredtreatment options for oesophageal strictures consists ofpneumatic or hydrostatic balloon dilation. The aim of thisarticle is to report 2 cases of severe oesophageal stricture inthe horse, successfully treated with endoscopic-guidedhydrostatic balloon dilation. Oesophageal stricture (OS) is a narrowing of theoesophageal lumen causing an obstructive syndrome inhorses (Green and Macfadden 1990). Oesophageal stricturemay be classi ed as congenital or acquired, benign or malignant and, according to its origin, as intra- or extramural(Gualtieri 2012). Symptoms of congenital stenosis appearshortly after birth and only the mucosal and submucosallayers of the oesophagus are usually involved (Stick 1987;Tillotson et al. 2003). Acquired strictures can be caused by external or internal trauma such as long-term oesophagealobstruction which can produce circumferential ulceration, akick from another horse, nasogastric tube trauma, or oesophageal rupture healing,etc. (Bezdekova 2012). Intramural OS is usually an annularlesion and can be classi ed into the following 3 types according to the anatomic location of induration and brosis: mural lesions that involve only the adventitia and muscularis layers ( type 1 ); oesophageal rings that involve only the mucosa and submucosa ( type 2 ) and annular stenosis that involves all layers of the wall ( type 3 ) (Fubini 2002). Oesophageal stricture from any cause is manifested as one or more of the following clinical signs: dysphagia, recurrent food impactions (choke) that can cause proximal oesophageal dilation, weight loss and aspiration pneumonia (Freeman 2005). Traditionally, intramural OS in horses has been treated by surgery with resection and anastomosis (Gideon 1984), mucosal resection and myotomy (Derksen and Stick 1993), patch al. combined oesophagostomy and cicatrix fenestration (Craig andTodhunter 1987), oesophagomyotomy (Nixon et al. 1983) and combined oesophagomyotomy and oesophagopexy (Lillichet al. 2001). Conservative management has also beenreported consisting of a diet of grass and soaked pelleted complete feeds (Knottenbelt et al. 1992). Currently, in both human and small animal practice, one of the preferred treatment options for OS consists of balloon dilation (BD) (Harai et al. 1995; Leib et al. 2001; Zoran 2005). The latter may be performed via insuf flation of air (pneumatic dilation) or water (hydrostatic dilation) into an in flatable balloon of different sizes, positioned through the stricture. The choice of using water or air for distending the balloon depends on the stricture resistance and fragility of the oesophageal wall. Water distention of the balloon induces an even pressure at any site of the balloon surface being particularly suitable for the dilation of strong strictures; balloons distended with air are characterised by higher deformability and are better indicated for small and young animals whose oesophageal wall is thin and fragile (Gualtieri 2012). To our knowledge, the BD technique in equine practice has only been reported in 3 cases (Tillotson et al. 2003; Reichelt et al. 2012). The aim of the present paper is to report 2 cases of severe OS in the horse which were successfully treated withendoscopic-guided BD. Case 1 History A 9-year-old Warmblood mare, weighing 563 kg, was referredbecause of weight loss and persistent dysphagia of 3 weeks ' duration. No solid food could be administered without theonset of coughing and nasal discharge of food material.Approximately 2 weeks prior to the onset of clinical signs, thehorse underwent repeated nasogastric intubation due toconstipation colic. Clinical examination Physical examinationThe patient appeared moderately thin (body condition score4/9, Kronfeld 1998) and a 12 cm swelling in the lower third ofthe left jugular furrow was apparent; the swelling was notpainful and was rm in consistency. Mucous membranes were normal, rectal temperature was 38.1 \u00b0C, heart rate was 36 beats/min and respiratory rate 16 breaths/min. The slap test was negative (i.e. no palpable cricoarytenoid dorsalis muscle contraction) on the left side and thoracic auscultation revealed continuous crackles on both sides of \u00a92015 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE pulmonary area. Abdominal auscultationand rectal palpation were normal.EndoscopyEndoscopy of the upper airways showed a grade IV left laryngeal neuropathy while mucus accumulation was apparent in the tracheal ( grade III , Gerber et al. 2004). Endoscopy of both guttural pouches was normal. After an accurate removal of food and saliva at a distance of 90 cm from the nostrils, oesophagoscopy revealed a large, irregular, de-epithelialised hyperaemic area. The lesion was followed by a lumen stricture of approximately 5 mm in diameter that prevented further progression of a 13 mm endoscope (60332 PKS/NKS) 1(Fig 1 ). The stricture diameter was by comparison with the 2.2 mm biopsy forceps. Radiography Double contrast oesophagography was performed using a liquid positive contrast agent (barium sulphate) and a negative contrast agent (air) administered through a stomach tube, positioned before the stricture. At the level of the distal third of the cervical oesophagus, oesophagography revealed a narrow stricture of a few millimetres in length with signi cant barium accumulation proximal to it. In the post stenotic tract, barium and air accumulation was evident ( Fig 2 ). Thoracic radiography did not show any pattern consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Clinical pathology The results of the laboratory analysis showed only a mild hyperbilirubinaemia (6.7 mg/dl; normal range: 0.9 -2.9 mg/dl, Lumsden et al. 1980). Microbiology A tracheal wash was performed transendoscopically for bacterial culture and this technique has previously been reported elsewhere (Ferrucci et al. 2008). No pathogens were isolated under aerobic and microaerophilic conditions. Diagnosis and prognosis On the basis of these results a diagnosis of oesophagealstricture was reached. The prognosis was considered to beguarded in view of the chronicity of the condition and therisks of aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition.Treatment After diagnosis, the horse was hospitalised in order to performendoscopic-guided BD. A human device was used (OTW,40 mm in diameter, 10 cm in length with a 100 cm longguide wire) 2(Fig 3 ). Since the balloon was too large to be inserted into the biopsy channel of the endoscope, a periendoscopic technique was used. Brie fly, the patient was restrained in stocks and sedated with 10 lg/kg bwt detomidine (Domosedan)3and the empty balloon inserted through the nostril under endoscopic control and then through the nasopharynx and oesophageal lumen until it reached the stricture. Positioned through the stricture, the balloon was progressively lled with tap water by an in flation device (DS-60CC-S)4until a pressure of 3.5 atm was obtained and maintained in this position for 5 min. When necessary, 0.2 mg/kg bwt g every 8 h per os Ampicillin (Vetamplius)8 11 mg/kg bwt every 8 h i.m. were administered. The horse was fed with an enteral fluid preparation (Rooney 2004), the composition of which is reported inTable 1 and this was administered orally approximately every 2 h. No access to solid food was permitted to avoid furtherepisodes of dysphagia and possible aspiration pneumonia. Fig 1: Oesophagoscopy (Case 1): large, irregular, de- epithelialised hyperaemic area. The lesion is followed by a lumenstricture, of approximately 5 mm in diameter, that prevents furtherprogression of a 13 mm endoscope.

Fig 3: 1): Balloon positioned through thestricture. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd260EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017Outcome A total of 16 daily dilating sessions was required to obtain therelease of the stenosis. After resolution, the endoscope couldprogress through the stricture into the distal part of theoesophageal lumen and stomach and no further lesions wereobserved. By that time, the horse was able to eat normallyand no regurgitation occurred. During hospitalisation, vitalparameters remained within normal limits and nocomplications occurred. At discharge, since the horse wasable to eat normally and its bodyweight had increased by8 kg, it was recommended to continue feeding pelleted feedand soaked hay. After discharge, follow-up information was collected by phone enquiry over a 2-year period. The horse did not showany further signs of dysphagia and returned to full athleticperformance. Case 2 History A 9-year-old showjumping pony gelding, weighing kg,was referred because of dysphagia, nasal discharge and apainful swelling on the left side of the neck. The ownerreported that the lesion appeared 2 months earlier after ani.v. phenylbutazone injection to which the animal reactedstrongly. The owner referred that, few days before admission,an oesophagoscopy under general anaesthesia wasperformed. According to the diagnosis of severeoesophageal stricture euthanasia was advised. Clinical examination Physical examinationThe pony appeared in poor body condition (body score 3/9;Kronfeld 1998) and presented with dysphagia, nasaldischarge, stiffness of the neck, oesophageal spasm andanxiety. In the middle third of the left cervical region apainful rm swelling of approximately 15 cm in diameter was observed. Over the swelling, spotted areas of leukotrichiawere present ( Fig 4 ). Mucous membranes were icteric, body temperature was 37.5 \u00b0C, heart rate was 32 beats/min and respiratory rate 12 breaths/min. The slap test was negative onthe left side (i.e. no palpable cricoarytenoid dorsalis muscle contraction). On auscultation of the chest, respiratorywheezes were audible over the whole pulmonary area. Bothspontaneous and provoked coughing was also present.When coughing, whitish mucous bilateral nasal dischargewas apparent. Auscultation of the abdomen and rectalpalpation were normal.EndoscopyEndoscopy of the upper airways revealed a grade IV left laryngeal neuropathy and grade II pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia. Tracheoscopy showed IV accumulation of mucus within the tracheal lumen (Gerber et al. of guttural pouches didnot show any abnormality. After an accurate removal of food and saliva at a distance of 65 cm from the nostrils, oesophagoscopy revealed a large, linear, de-epithelialised hyperaemic area. The lesion was followed by a lumen stricture of approximately 3 mm in diameter that prevented further progression of a 13 mm endoscope (CF30L) 9(Fig 5 ). Radiography Double contrast oesophagography using a liquid positive contrast agent (barium sulphate) and a negative contrast agent (air) administered through a stomach tube. Oesophagography showed signi cant barium and air accumulation proximal to the stricture. A very narrowbarium line depicted the extension of a canalar obstruction which extended for approximately 15 cm. Distal to this tract an accumulation of air and barium was observed ( Fig 6 ). Ultrasonography Thoracic ultrasonography revealed numerous bilateral comet tail artefacts in the cranioventral area. Clinical pathology The results of the laboratory analysis showed mild leucocytosis (14.6910 9/l; normal range: 4.9 -10.09109/l, (12.4 9109/l; normal range: 2.0 - 5.59109/l, Lumsden et al. 1980) (614 range: 150 -380 mg/dl, Lumsden 1980).TABLE Composition enteral ( Case 1 ) Ingredient Dosage/meal Total ingredients/day Pelleted horse feed 454 g 4860 g Corn oil 46 g 492 gWater 3 l 32 l Fig 4: Swelling with spotted areas of leukotrichia at the middlethird of left cervical region (Case 2).

Sensitivity test showed sensitivity to Ampicillin,Enro floxacin and Gentamicin. Diagnosis and prognosis According to the diagnostic procedures carried out, adiagnosis of oesophageal stricture was achieved. Theprognosis was considered poor for the chronicity and severityof the lesion, presence of aspiration pneumonia andprolonged starvation. Treatment The pony was hospitalised in order to perform endoscopic-guided BD. Due to the extremely narrow diameter of thestricture, different balloons of increasing diameter wereused. Before each session, the patient was restrained instocks and sedated with Detomidine 10 lg/kg bwt i.v. (Domosedan) 3. The early treatment consisted in 25 daily dilating sessions performed transendoscopically (CF30L)9 using a human medicine device (ECL-18 95.5)4. The balloon had a wire guide of 240 cm, a diameter of 18 mmand length of 5.5 cm ( Fig 7 ). The empty balloon was inserted into the endoscope biopsy channel and positioned through the stricture. It was then progressively lled with tap water by an in flation device (DS-60CC-S) 4until a pressure of 3.5 atm was reached and maintained in this position for 5 min. Fifteen daily treatments using another human medicine device (ECL-30 98)4were successively performed. The balloon, with a guide wire of 240 cm in length, was 30 mm in diameter and 8 cm in length. Finally, 20 daily dilations were performed using a larger balloon (WCAB-35)4. Since due to the length of the wire guide (75 cm) and the balloon size (35 mm in diameter and8 cm in length) the use of the biopsy channel was notfeasible, a periendoscopic technique was used (i.e. theballoon was inserted separately from the endoscope underendoscopic (Ranidyl)106.6 mg/kg bwt every 8 h per os were administered. The horse was fed with an enteral fluid preparation (Rooney 2004), the composition of which is reported inTable 2 and this was administered per os approximately every 4 h. No access to solid food was permitted until the BD process was completed to avoid further episodes of dysphagia and worsening of pneumonia. Outcome The pony received a total of 60 dilating treatments. Afterthe last session, the 13 mm endoscope could progressthrough the stricture. Thus, the distal part of theoesophageal lumen and stomach could be inspected andno further lesions were observed. During hospitalisation vitalparameters remained within normal limits and nocomplications occurred. At discharge, since the horse wasable to eat normally and its bodyweight had increased by32 kg, it was recommended to continue feeding pelletedfeed and soaked hay. After discharge, follow-up information was collected by phone enquiry over a period of one year. The horse did notshow any further signs of dysphagia and returned to fullathletic performance.

In horses there are only few reports describing OS and even less data available regarding guidelines for oesophageal dilation in this species. Generally, the use of bougienage and pneumatic or hydrostatic dilation are considered to have minimal practical value in adult horses because of the limited availability of special equipment, limited experience and the fact that repetition of the procedure is often necessary and rarely successful (Knottenbelt et al. 1992; Stick 2012). Some fundamental differences regarding clinical presentation, oesophageal dysfunction and severity andduration of the lesions make a direct comparison betweenour cases and those cases reported earlier very dif cult. Tillotson et al. (2003) describe the resolution of a probable congenital stenosis performed in a young foal under generalanaesthesia with BD. In the case reported, the historyreported 6 previous episodes of choke over a 2-week period,each solved by passage of a nasogastric tube. Despiteseveral attempts with fluid and paste contrast media, a distinct narrowing of the oesophagus could not bedemonstrated by oesophagography. Reichelt et al. (2012) report 2 cases of acquired stenosis in adult horses, solved by a single session of BD with the patientsstanding. The rst case was a 47-year-old pony mare fed with soaked pellets and hay because of chronic, recurrentepisodes of choke. A stricture was identi ed in the cervical oesophagus during endoscopy but could not bedemonstrated with negative or positive contrast and doublecontrast oesophagography. In the second case, referred foroccasional episodes of choke, a 17 mm nasogastic tube waspassed into the stomach with no dif culty and endoscopy revealed an intact oesophageal mucosa. However, contrastoesophagography showed a stricture in the thoracicoesophagus at the level of the tracheal bifurcation. Compared with previous reports, in our cases obstructive symptoms were very evident and severe, i.e. no solid foodcould be administered without the onset of dysphagia andnasal discharge of food material. Case 2 was in poor body condition and OS was complicated by aspiration pneumonia. In both cases, the stricture was evident both endoscopically and radiographically. The lesion prevented the passage of the endoscope and only a 2.2 mm biopsy forceps could be passed through it. Besides, double contrast oesophagography was able to clearly demonstrate a very narrow stricture associated with barium accumulation in both cases. Regarding the aetiology, in Case 1 the stricture was possibly due to internal trauma caused by repeated nasogastric intubation. Therefore, the lesion could beconsidered as type 2 , i.e. only mucosa and submucosa involved. However, the presence of a rm swelling in the left jugular furrow and grade IV left laryngeal neuropathy suggested the involvement of deeper layers and surrounding tissues. In Case 2 , the stricture was probably due to external trauma to the oesophageal wall, caused by accidentalintramural phenylbutazone injection. In this case, the lesioncould be classi ed as type 3 , i.e. all layers of the oesophageal wall are involved. Furthermore, swelling, leukotrichia and the presence of heat and pain on palpationwere consistent with a more severe involvement of theoesophageal wall and surrounding tissues. The different treatment options were evaluated according to the case presentation, owner compliance and evaluationof possible side effects. According to the literature, for Case 1 a conservative treatment based on frequent feeding of small quantities of soft food, anti-in flammatory and antimicrobial therapy would have been preferable to surgery (Fubini 2002; Stick 2012). In fact, mucosal stricture formation can occur from as early as the 15th day after mucosal damage, the greatest narrowing happens between Days 30 and 45 but the oesophageal lumen can return to normal by Day 60 under conservative management (Todhunter et al. 1984; Knottenbelt et al. 1992; Fubini et al. 1999; Stick 2006). Unfortunately, due to the narrow stricture, the horse was able to eat only a liquid feed that could not act as a natural stricture dilator. Therefore, an endoscopic BD protocol was established. In order to obtain as i g n i cant lumen enlargement to allow passage of solid food, a relatively large number of dilating sessions were needed. InCase 2 , surgical treatment was rejected by the owner who was concerned about the horse 's poor body condition and possible complications after surgery. Despite the poor prognosis, the pony was hospitalised in order to perform endoscopic BD that was planned with different progressive steps, in order to avoid possible oesophageal rupture. The owner was made aware that the hospitalisation would be protracted, costs would be elevated and the treatmentcould be ineffective. According to the chronicity of the lesion (>60 days), which involved the entire thickness of the oesophageal wall and the very narrow and quite extended OS, a large number of dilating sessions with balloons of progressively larger size were needed in this case. As reported in human and small animal medicine, repeated dilating sessions are required in cases of annular stenosis that involve all layers of the oesophageal wall and for long-term management of chronically affected patients (Harai et al. 1995; Grabowski and Andrews 1998; Katzka et al. 2000; Uygun et al. 2013). Moreover, it may be assumed that a major component of the resistanceto dilation could be exerted by brosis of surrounding tissues. This hypothesis seems to be particularly true for Case 2 in which the necrotising effect of phenylbutazone may haveresulted in a larger and painful swelling in the left jugularfurrow. In this case, the chronicity and type of lesion probablyexplain the larger number of dilating sessions whencompared with Case 1 . Furthermore, the long extension of the lesion (15 cm) and reduced length of the balloons used(from 5.5 to 8 cm) may also have affected the duration ofthe treatment protocol which had to be performed in aprogressive fashion. According to these considerations, in those cases in which a full thickness involvement and/or an involvement ofthe surrounding tissues were suspected, an ultrasonographicevaluation of the oesophagus and adjacent region would beadvisable in order to reach a de nitive prognosis. The use of electrocautery incision of the brous tissue followed by dilation has previously been described as a possible treatment of certain types of resistant annular or tortuous strictures in human and small animal medicine (Hordijk et al. 2009; Gualtieri 2012). To the authors ' knowledge, this combined technique has not been reported \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd263EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017in the horse. However, in the future it may be taken intoconsideration for chronic dilation-resistant strictures. Despite the large number of dilating sessions, the procedure reported here appeared to be safe and effective.The horses did not show any signs of discomfort during thedaily dilating sessions and no complications, such as ruptureor perforation of the oesophageal wall, balloon rupture, etc.were observed during the course of hospitalisation.Preparation of a homemade liquid diet and frequentadministration of food were particularly labourious so, whenavailable, commercially available products for horses couldbe an option. The long-term prognosis was excellent for bothpatients. In conclusion, repeated BD can be considered asafe and effective procedure for the management ofchronic complicated cases of OS in the horse, particularlywhen surgery is not an option. Indeed, more studies arerequired to standardise the technique in equine patients. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Pasicka*, V. Onarand P. M. Dixon\u00a7 Department of Biostructure and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Wroc aw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Poland;Department of Anatomy, Osteoarchaeology Practice and Research Centre, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, _Istanbul University, Avcilar, Turkey; and\u00a7The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and The Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush Veterinary Campus, Midlothian, UK. was a mandible belonging to a morphologicallymature horse of the late Byzantium period, discovered duringexcavations at Theodosius Harbour in Istanbul, Turkey thathad a developmental molar tooth abnormality, i.e. asupernumerary molar tooth. This is an interesting case due tothe rarity of supernumerary molars in archaeozoologicalmaterials, and also because it is the only such case of equidpolydontia from the late Byzantium period from thatarchaeological site. Introduction Animal remains are among the materials most oftenaccquired during exploration of archaeological sites 2009). Animal bone or dental remains fromexcavations are, mainly because of their stability over time, asource of invaluable information on the anatomy andmorphology of the detected species (B \u20acok\u20aconyi 1974; 1980; O 'Connor 2000; Davis 2002; Bartosiewicz 2008). Because of the presence of multiple skeletons in somesites, they are suitable for comparative, quantitative andqualitive analyses (Von den Driesch 1976). Thesearchaeozoological ndings also indicate the role that domesticated animals had in cultural development ofcommunities at that time (Lasota-Moskalewska 2005), andhow domestication affected the biological characteristics ofthose animals (B \u20acok\u20aconyi 1974; Lasota-Moskalewska 2008). They are also a source of information on diseases of animalsclosely associated with man (Bartosiewicz 2008; Waldron2009). However, due to the fact that human consumptionremnants prevail in archaeozoological materials, animalremains with possible pathological abnormalities, includingskull fragments with anomalies, are 2008; Reitz and Wing 2008; Waldron2009; Pasicka et al. 2012, 2014). Materials and methods The analysed material consisted of a right-sided mandible(catalogue no. MRY3467), belonging to a morphologicallymature horse aged approximately 9 -11 years at the time of death. This age was estimated by examination of the very well preserved incisors, including assessment of the ovalshape of their occlusal surface, and the presence of some residual infundibula in all incisors ( Fig 1 ). In this paper, the Triadan system of equine dental nomenclature ( Fig 2 ) is used to identify individual teeth (Dixon and du Toit 2011). The well preserved undamaged right mandibular bone had loss of Triadan 406 and the presence of a caudally situated supernumerary molar tooth (Triadan 412). The attached rostral aspect of the left mandibular bone contained an incisor tooth and a portion of the left physiological diastema ( Fig 3 ). The presence of fully developed and erupted canine teeth con rms it was a mature male horse ( Fig 1 ). This specimen is a part of a collection owned by Osteoarchaeology Practice and Research Centre, Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, _Istanbul University. The mandible was mined during excavation at the site of Theodosius Harbour at Yenikapi in _Istanbul, Turkey .The age of this specimen was estimated by Fig 1: Incisor teeth of a Byzantine period horse recovered from Theodosius Harbour. Infundibular remnants are still present in allincisors; including a well-de ned, small 'cup 'in 302 and irregular shaped enamel 'rings '('marks ') in 303 and 403 (arrows). \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd266EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017radiocarbon dating (14C) as being from the period of Late Byzantium (15th century CE) (Onar et al. 2013). This jaw presents an anomaly in molar dentition uncommon forosteoarchaeological materials, as manifested by thepresence of an additional cheek tooth (Lasota-Moskalewska2008). It is also the only recorded occurrence of polyodontiainEquidae from the Byzantium period at the location in question (Onar et al. 2015). Results and discussion Estimating the age at which animals died on the basis ofskeletal or dental remains is hardly ever precise. Animals inprehistory were characterised by a slower ontogeny rate,compared to current species where there is a fastermorphological puberty, manifested by more rapid dentaldevelopment and closure of growth plates of long bones.Because of the geographical site of recovery of this skull, thishorse was possibly an Arabian horse-type breed, whoseincisor wear differs from other breeds (Muylle 2011).Additionally, when determining the age of an individualbased on dental examinations one should consider that theage norms adopted in archaeozoological research havebeen established in modern species (Lasota-Moskalewska2008). Visual examination of the incisor occlusal surfacesindicated that the animal was 9 -11 years old, but applying another method of ageing, namely radiographicexamination of the reserve crowns and roots using theguidelines for modern horses of Dixon and Copeland (1993),this horse could have been aged 12 -15 years when it died. Anomalies in dentition occur in both man and animals (Hillson 2005; Reitz and Wing 2008; France 2009; Waldron2009) and they can be divided into genetic, developmentaland acquired in origin (Baker and Brothwell 1980; Hillson2005). Malocclusion is the most common equine dentaldisorder and is caused by uneven attrition of the cheek teethocclusal surface, possibly due to dietary reasons (Lasota-Moskalewska 2008).Among the common equine developmental dental abnormalities, one should list the atavistic polydontia (typical), associated with the occurrence of a rudimentary 105/205 tooth at the beginning of the row (wolf tooth, dens lupinus )( K \u20aconig and Liebich 2007). Developmental dental abnormalities include anomalies of shape and position of teeth, reduced numbers (hypodontia) or even total absence of teeth (anodontia). Hypodontia must be differentiated from where a tooth has been lost due to disease or extracted during the animal 's life (acquired anomaly), and the alveoli of such teeth shows signs of healing (Chaix et al. 1997) .

The 406 tooth is missing; and asupernumerary 412 (arrow) is present. \u00a92015 EVJ VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017Apparent supernumerary teeth may actually be due to retention of deciduous teeth. True polyodontia may be due to random divisions of dental primordia. Horses can also have displaced polyodontia, exempli ed by a dentigerous cyst, found on the dorsal aspect of the skull in horses (Jubb and Kennedy 1963). The true prevalence of equid supernumerary teeth is unknown, but clinical surveys have shown it to occur more commonly in incisors than in cheek teeth (B \u20acok\u20aconyi 1974; Dixon et al. 1999a,b; Hillson 2005), and more commonly in younger than in mature horses (B \u20acok\u20aconyi 1974; Dixon et al. 2005; Hillson 2005). However in donkeys, polyodontia wasidenti ed in 4 -5% of cases aged 6 years and older (Rodrigues et al. 2013). Examination of photographs and radiographs of this specimen showed loss of the Triadan 406, although noradiographic or gross anatomic evidence of alveolar diseasewas evident and so this loss is likely to be an artefactual post mortem loss. On gross examination, there is a slight ventral swelling of the mandible, circa 3 -4 cm in length beneath the Triadan 407 and 408, with a more focal 1 -2 cm wide periosteal reaction beneath the cadual root of 407. Radiography doesnot show any abnormalities in the overlying 407 or 408 teeth,but con rmed the presence of a localised periostitis of the ventral mandible. In an equid of this age, this swelling is verylikely to be due to a local mandibular trauma that occurredmany months earlier. Younger (age 3 -5 years) equids commonly have mandibular swellings due to eruption cysts atthis site (Dixon and du Toit 2011). There exists an apparently artefactual, super cial, vertical fracture of the lateral aspect of the mandible between 407 and 408 -that is not apparent on radiography and so this fracture is also likely to be a post mortem artefactual fracture (Fig 2 ). The 411 that is normally the most caudal cheek tooth, has a normal occlusal surface, and contains the usual six pulphorns and the normal triangular occlusal shape of amandibular Triadan 411 (Dixon and du Toit 2011). Lateralradiographs ( Fig 2 ) of this tooth shows a wide reserve crown, and a poorly de ned cadual root, as compared to all other cheek teeth roots in this specimen, but this wide reserve crown and delayed cadual root development is a common feature of the equid Triadan 411 mandibular tooth (Dixon and Copeland 1993). As noted, there is a supernumerary cheek tooth (412) present. Because of the absence of an antagonist tooth, this tooth has overgrown considerably ( >1 cm) in height, particularly on its caudal aspect ( Fig 2 ). If the animal had survived, this 412 overgrowth would have increased greatlyand eventually caused a severe clinical problem by initiallylacerating the tongue and soft tissues of the hard palateregion during mastication and even later, possibly penetratingthe hard palate (Dixon 2010). Food invariably becomesimpacted into diastemata that commonly develop betweenthe supernumerary and adjacent teeth leading to painfulperiodontal disease (Dixon et al. 1999b, 2005; Dixon 2010). Radiographic examination of the apex of this supernumerary tooth indicates this to be a relatively recently (estimated to be aged <2-3 years) erupted tooth because there is no root (enamel free apical area) developed yet, even allowing that root development in supernumerary teethmay not follow the usual pattern, and that this Byzantine period horse may not have grown and developed as quicklyas modern horses. There is also a lucent area beneath the apex of the supernumerary tooth resembling an eruption cyst, with sclerosis of the adjacent alveolar lining. However, the height of the overgrowth on this tooth may indicate that the tooth had been erupted for possibly 4 -6 years ( Fig 2 ). This supernumerary tooth is also possibly dysplastic because does not taper (rostrocaudally) in an apical direction like a normal cheek tooth (Dixon and du Toit 2011), but instead appears to be slightly wider more apically, even allowing that it is a young tooth. However, its structure is not that of a connated (more than one tooth joined together) supernumerary tooth (Dixon 2010). Otherwise this tooth seems of normal morphology. Based on the information gathered during analyses, we can conclude that the described mandible belonged to a morphologically mature horse, which survived with the described developmental polyodontia up to age about 9 - 11 years. There is no gross or radiographic evidence that the presence of this additional tooth was causing a clinical problem to this horse and it was very unlikely to have caused its death.

Barber, B. K. Wobeser and K. L. Lohmann Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, are rare in the horse and, tothe authors 'knowledge, no cases have been reported that include measurements of each segment of the large colon toconrm which section is abnormal .This case report describes chronic, intermittent colic in a Quarter Horse lly that had been attributed to chronic idiopathic hepatitis prior to an exploratory laparotomy. A colonic anomaly discovered at surgery became the primary differential for aetiology of the intermittent colic. Euthanasia of the lly and necropsy allowed further examination of the anomaly, where it was determined that the dorsal colon was short compared to the ventral large colon. In addition, the diagnosis of chronic idiopathic hepatitis was con rmed. Introduction Chronic, intermittent colic is de ned as a horse experiencing more than two episodes of colic in the previous 12 monthsand may be attributed to a variety of causes (Cohen andPeloso 1996). Some of the risk factors for chronic, intermittentcolic include previous celiotomy, advancing age and recentdiet change (Cohen and Peloso 1996). Diagnoses associatedwith chronic colic include but are not limited to: colonicimpaction, peritonitis, colitis, colonic displacement, intestinaladhesions, liver 's diverticulum (Mair and Hillyer 1997). Colonic anomalies are extremely rare, but have been reported as a cause of chronic, intermittent colic (Suann and Livesey 1986; Mair 2002). The incidence of congenital anomalies affecting the equine gastrointestinal tract varies from 0.1 to 0.5% (Ward Crowe and Swerczek 1985; Robertet al. 2008) and reports in the literature are few (Mair 2002). Congenital anomalies affecting the gastrointestinal tract do not always result in signs of colic (Trope and Steel 2010). Defects that have been associated with colic include: abnormalities in the mesocolon or mesentery (Steenhaut et al. Rakestraw and Hardy mesodiverticular bands (Trope and Steel 2010), Meckel 's diverticulum (Freeman 2012) and abnormalities of the ascending colon (Suann and Livesey 1986; Bassage et al. 2000; Mair et Robert et al. 2008; Trope and Steel 2010; Rakestraw and Hardy 2012). Here we describe a case of congenital hypoplasia of the dorsal colon, leading to the presence of an extra flexure in the ventral colon, which was the suspected cause of this horse 's chronic, intermittent colic episodes. Although evidence of mild, chronic idiopathic hepatitis waspresent, the authors feel the changes were too mild to cause the signs of colic. Case history A 10-month-old Quarter Horse lly presented for investigation of chronic, intermittent colic. The episodes of colic began when the lly was weaned, at age approximately 6 months. The frequency and duration of colic events was not speci ed but intermittent colic signs of 4 months 'duration were reported. Signs observed during episodes of colic included: inappetance, separation from the herd, pawing and prolonged lateral recumbency. The colic would resolve spontaneously and the lly was considered normal in-between episodes, although she did occasionally have non-formed faeces. Apart from weaning, there had been no dietary or housing changes and the other horses and foals on the property were considered normal. The lly's dam was vaccinated against Eastern and Western encephalitis, West Nile virus encephalitis and tetanus, but the lly herself had not yet been vaccinated. She had received treatment per os with fenbendazole (Panacur paste)1dosed to 10 mg/kg bwt at age 9 and 10 months, prior to the current veterinary involvement. The initial physical examination ndings included an elevated heart rate of 68 beats/min, tacky oral mucous membranes and a body condition score of 4/9. Other parameters were within normal limits. Abnormalities on a serum chemistry panel and complete blood count included: moderate elevation in c-glutamyl transferase (GGT; 82 u/l, 0 -5 u/l) (Table 1 ), mild elevation in total protein (76 g/l, rr 59 -73 g/l) and a microcytosis (mean 36.8 fl, rr 42.5 - 53.1 fl). Faecal egg count was low with 5 strongyle eggs/g of faeces and no ascarid eggs observed. Further diagnostic work-up, including percutaneous abdominal ultrasonography and abdominocentesis, was declined. No treatment was administered and no cause for the colic was determined. At age 16 months the lly presented again with the same complaint. The owners reported the colic episodes had continued since the examination at age 10 months, but were sporadic and dif cult to predict. In-between episodes, the lly remained bright, alert and responsive and had a good appetite. Physical examination was unremarkable. Blood work was repeated and revealed further elevations in GGT (88 u/l), AST (557 u/l) and GLDH (108 u/l), with the elevation in being most marked ( 1 ). Serum were / MAY 2017normal (6 lmol/l, rr <15lmol/l). Abnormalities on the complete blood count at that time revealed eosinophilia (0.665 9109/l, rr 0.0 -0.39109/l), continued microcytosis and mild elevation of total protein (76 g/l, rr 59 -73 g/l), although total protein was normal on the chemistry panel. Diagnostics including rectal palpation, abdominocentesis, abdominal ultrasonography, liver biopsy and exploratory laparotomy were discussed but declined by the owners. Approximately one month later, the lly presented again following similar signs of colic, with severe signs for 3 days andmilder signs for an additional 2 days. At the time of presentation the lly was not obviously uncomfortable and physical examination was within normal limits. A serumchemistry panel was repeated: abnormal ndings included further and more severe elevations in (147 u/l), AST (721 u/l) and GLDH (236 u/l; Table 1 ). Given this information, and the apparent increase in frequency and severity of the colic events, further diagnostics were again recommended and the owners agreed to hospitalisation for further testing. Clinical ndings On presentation to the hospital, approximately one weekfrom the previous examination, the lly was bright, alert and responsive, vital parameters were within normal limits and sheshowed no signs of colic. Results of a serum chemistry paneland complete blood count were similar to previous tests(Table 1 ). A coagulation panel including prothrombin time (11.0 s, rr 7.0 -11.0 s), partial thromboplastin time (37.1 s, rr 27.2 -49.6 s) and brin degradation products ( <5lg/ml, rr <5lg/ml) was within normal limits. The lly was hospitalised and monitored for 9 days during which time her appetite andfaecal output were considered normal, however she didshow signs of colic on Days 3, 4 and 5 of hospitalisation. OnDay 3, she was found in lateral recumbency, flank watching and depressed. Physical examination revealed mild dehydration (tacky oral mucous membranes) but vital parameters and gastrointestinal borborygmi were within normal limits; rectal examination and abdominal ultrasound examination at this time were unremarkable. The lly responded to treatment with i.v. flunixin meglumine (Flunixin Injection) 2at 1.1 mg/kg bwt and hand walking. Colic signs returned on Days 4 and 5; again vital parameters andgastrointestinal borborygmi were within normal limits and thelly responded to treatment with flunixin meglumine. Diagnostics and post mortem ndings In addition to the described diagnostic testing andexaminations speci c to colic episodes on Days 3, 4 and 5 ofhospitalisation, the lly underwent rectal examination on Days 1 and 2 of hospitalisation, abdominal ultrasonography on Days 2 and 3, abdominocentesis on Day 2, liver biopsy on Day 2 and exploratory laparotomy on Day 9. Peritoneal fluid collected by abdominocentesis was grossly normal; total protein concentration was 8 g/l (normal <25 g/l) (Smith and Magdesian 2009) 9/l nucleated fluid was interpreted as a transudate with low protein and low nucleated cell count. Ultrasonography (GE Logiq P6)3of the abdomen and liver showed no obvious abnormalities, although the liver was subjectively small. Transcutaneous liver biopsies taken on Day 2 of hospitalisation were negative for bacterial culture. Histological ndings from the liver biopsy included mild periportal to bridging brosis, mild, chronic-active suppurative hepatitis and mild to moderate biliary hyperplasia. These ndings, along with the serial blood work, supported a diagnosis of chronic idiopathic hepatitis ( Fig 1 ). An exploratory laparotomy was scheduled as diagnostics performed to date had not led to a de nitive diagnosis and the colic episodes continued. The lly was anaesthetised, positioned in dorsal recumbency and a ventral midline incision made. Dif culty was encountered in attempting to exteriorise the ascending colon. Once exteriorised it was apparent that the ascending colon was abnormally shaped with an extra flexure located approximately 40 cm orad to the pelvic flexure within the ventral colon ( Fig 2 ). Grossly, the serosa of the section of colon within the extra flexure was normal in colour; peristaltic movements were normal and there was no appreciable variation in diameter. No other abnormalities were found during the laparotomy. Resection and anastomosis of the apparently extra flexure were offered but declined by the owner and the lly was subjected to euthanasia without recovery from anaesthesia. A complete post mortem examination was performed in which the abnormal flexure located within the length of the left ventral colon was con rmed. The liver was of normal weight at 5.2 kg (average 5 kg) (Dyce et al. 2002). The length of each portion of the ascending colon was measuredTABLE 1: Changes in liver enzyme values over time AgeGamma glutamyl transferase (reference range -347 u/l)Glutamate dehydrogenase (reference range 0 -5 u/l) 10 months 82 452 34 16 months 88 557 10817 months 147 721 23617 months, 1 week136 581 182 Fig 1: Liver section stained in hematoxylin and eosin, showing mild periportal to bridging brosis and periportal inflammation. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd271EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017both before and after removal of ingesta with the ratios oflengths remaining constant. The length of each section priorto ingesta removal showed that the caecum was 81 cm fromapex to base; the ventral colon was 139 cm and the dorsalcolon 119 cm, a full 20 cm shorter than the ventral colon.Multiple sections of the various anatomic portions of theascending colon were submitted for histological evaluationwith no abnormalities found. Histopathology of the livercon rmed ndings of the biopsy no de nitive diagnosis or aetiological agent identi ed. Based on ante and post mortem diagnostic ndings, the nal diagnoses for this lly were idiopathic congenital hypoplasia of the dorsal colon and idiopathic chronichepatitis. Discussion Based on serial blood work and histological evaluation of liverbiopsies prior to exploratory laparotomy, the lly described herein was diagnosed with chronic idiopathic hepatitis.Exploratory laparotomy was undertaken due to the milddegree of hepatitis and the authors 'lack of conviction that the hepatitis was the cause of the lly's colic. Hepatitis certainly can cause colic (Barton 2010) but as the changesto the liver in the current case were mild, it is unlikely thathepatitis was causing the colic episodes. It is more likely thatthe colic episodes were due to intermittent impaction ordysmotility of the extra flexure of the left ventral colon and the hepatitis was a separate problem. There are several reports in the literature describing anomalies of the ascending colon of the horse including:stellate shape, T-shaped malformation and extra loop (Suannand Steel 2010). To theauthors 'knowledge, no colonic anomalies previously reported have used measurement to de ne the location of the anomaly. In the current case, an elongation of the ventralcolon was initially suspected, which accounted for theappearance of the extra flexure. This presumption of increased length of ventral colon has been shared by other authors (Mair2002; Trope and Steel 2010). In the current case, measurementof each segment of the ascending colon at necropsyindicated a shortening of the dorsal colon was the trueabnormality, and based on the attending pathologist 's opinion it is surmised that the extra flexure in the ventral colon was an accommodation to this shortened segment of dorsal colon. To the authors 'knowledge, there are no published references for the length of each section of the ascending colon, only an average total length of 3 -4 m has been reported (Schummer et al. 1979). As measurements were not reported (Suann and Livesey 1986; Mair 2002; Trope and Steel 2010) and no normal values are known, it is impossible to compare reports and one must take care not to jump to conclusions regarding a hypoplastic process of the dorsal colon vs. an elongation process of the ventral colon. The pathogenesis of colonic anomalies has not been de ned (Trope and Steel 2010). However, where congenital pathological conditions are concerned, hypoplasia or dysplasia leading to a decrease in the length of the dorsal colon seems more likely than elongation of the ventral colon. Previous reports have shown that surgical correction of large colon anomalies in the horse may be successful (Suann and Livesey 1986; Mair 2002; Koenig et al. 2007; Trope and Steel 2010); correction was not attempted in the current case. In the current case, the lly's colic episodes began at weaning, suggesting that they were triggered by a change from a mostly liquid to a solid diet. The authors infer that impaction or abnormal motility of the extra flexure in the left ventral colon was the cause of the lly's chronic, intermittent colic. The hepatitis encountered in this case was probably a separate problem. This case points to the need for publishedreferences regarding the length of each section of the large colon of the horse. Clinicians and pathologists should consider that hypoplasia of one or more sections of the ascending colon may be the problem when presented with a case of colonic anomaly.

M. Whyard, J. Daglishand I. M. Wright\u00a7* Department of Surgical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin, USA;Department of Clinical Sciences, James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, USA; and\u00a7Newmarket Equine fragmentation of thecarpus is a common injury in racing horses. Frequencydistributions of sites of fragmentation have previously beenpublished in racehorses in the USA, Australia, New Zealandand Japan but not in racing Thoroughbreds in the UK. Theobjectives of the study were to document sites ofosteochondral fragmentation in the carpus of a population ofThoroughbred flat racehorses in the UK and compare these with other Thoroughbred populations globally and other flat racing breeds. This study was a single centre retrospectiveobservational study; case records of flat racing Thoroughbreds with sites of carpal bone fragmentation thatunderwent arthroscopic surgery at Newmarket EquineHospital between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed. A total of291 sites of fragmentation were identi ed arthroscopically within the carpal joints of 174 horses. This involved 135 (75%) middle carpal (MCj) and 44 (25%) antebrachiocarpal joints(ABCj), which differs from other populations reported. The most common sites of fragmentation were dorsodistal radial carpal The dorsodistal radial carpal bone is also the most common site in American (US) Quarter Horses (QHs) and Thoroughbreds (TBs) and Australian (AUS) TBs, while DPrC3 has a greater prevalence in US Standardbreds (SBs). Thereafter the frequency distribution differs between the reported study groups. Although all horses underwent bilateral radiographic examination, 45% of the total population had unilateral arthroscopic evaluation. This may therefore underestimate the total number of sites of fragmentation reported. In summary the frequency distribution of carpal fragmentation in flat racing Thoroughbreds in the UK appears to differ from other populations of racehorses. Introduction Lameness associated with osteochondral fragmentation ofthe distal radius and cuboidal bones of the carpus is acommon training and racing injury in Thoroughbred (TB)racehorses. In some cases these present as acute injuries. Inothers, fragmentation appears to have resulted at the end ofa pathological process (McIlwraith et al. 2014). The latter is believed to be the result of a failure of adaptation of thesubchondral bone resulting in increased stiffness and bonedensity. Compressive forces created by carpal (hyper)extension are suggested to lead to fatigue failure and osteochondral fragmentation (Tidswell et al. 2008). Cumulative microdamage in subchondral bone has been demonstrated experimentally (Kawcak et al. 2000) and it has been recognised that some fragments originate from articular margins previously altered by subchondral bone disease (Pool and Meagher 1990). Osteochondral fragmentation creates incongruity of articular surfaces. Additionally, osteochondral debris is a potent mechanical and chemical irritant to articular cartilage and synovium respectively (McIlwraith et al. 2014). The resultant synovitis generates effusion with associated increased intra-articular pressure. The affected synovium also liberates a plethora of in flammatory mediators which result in a self-perpetuating cycle of in flammation that may culminate in the development of osteoarthritis. Arthroscopic removal of osteochondral fragments is therefore recommended in order to minimise articular insult and prevent development ofosteoarthritis (McIlwraith and Bramlage 1996). McIlwraith et al. (1987) reported the prevalence and location of osteochondral fragments in 580 racehorses in the United States (US), including 220 TBs and 349 Quarter Horses (QHs). Cumulative data from Palmer (1986) and Lucas et al. (1999) provided a total of 251 US Standardbreds (SBs) with osteochondral fragmentation of the carpus. Raidal and Wright (1996) reported carpal injuries in 220 Australian (AUS) TBs in which 210 sites of carpal bone fragmentation were identi ed. Additional studies from New Zealand (NZ) and Japan documenting carpal bone fragmentation in TBs have also been published (Kannegieter and Burbidge 1990; Shimozawa et al. 2000). Carpal osteochondral fragment location frequency distribution in UK flat racing TBs has not been previously documented. The objective of this retrospective study was to report the relative frequency distribution of carpal fragmentation in a population of flat racing TBs in the UK and compare the results with other populations of flat racing horses from different geographical locations. The hypothesis of the study was that the distribution of sites of osteochondral fragmentation in the carpus within a population of flat racing Thoroughbreds in the UK is different to that of other populations of racehorses worldwide. Materials and methods Case records of all TBs in flat race training admitted to Newmarket Equine Hospital between 2008 and 2013 that \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd274EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / surgery for carpal osteochondralfragmentation of the dorsal aspect of the carpal bones wereevaluated. Slab fractures and fractures of the accessorycarpal bone were excluded. All cases in this study underwentarthroscopic surgery under general anaesthesia. All horseswere included in the study reported by Jago et al. (2015) and therefore some received perioperative fluoroquinolones. Arthroscopy was performed by a European board certi ed surgeon experienced in advanced arthroscopic techniques(I.M. Wright), as previously described by McIlwraith et al. (2014), to evaluate between 1 and 4 of the available carpaljoints depending upon clinical and radiographic ndings. 1For the purposes of this study, a fragment was de ned as per the Oxford English Dictionary as 'a piece broken off '(Coulson et al. 1959). Speci cally, osteochondral fragmentation was dened as pieces of subchondral bone with overlying articular cartilage involving a single articular surface of the cuboidal bones of the carpus or distal radius. Lesions involving articular cartilage only, subchondral erosions or areas of compromised subchondral bone without discrete lines of cleavage from the parent bone were not included. With displaced fragments, location was de ned as the site of origin of the fragment(s). In all cases information regarding signalment, whether raced or unraced, use of radiographs for diagnosis and sites of fragmentation identi ed on arthroscopy for each horse were determined from retrospective analysis of existing case records; speci c locations of fragmentation within the carpus, limb(s) involved and joint(s) affected were also recorded aspositive outcome measures. Subsequently, the data wasorganised into relative frequency distributions for the locationof sites of fragmentation identi ed, joint involved and limb affected. These were compared with previously reportedfrequency distributions for groups of other racing horsepopulations to evaluate similarities and differences inprevalence of arthroscopically con rmed fragmentation in the carpal joints 1986; McIlwraith et al. 1987; Raidal and Wright 1996; Lucas et al. 1999). A 2-tailed Fisher 's exacttest was applied to the data using the SAS 2statistical programme to determine the likelihood of the presence of fragmentation at each of the possible locations within the carpus for the UK TB population compared to the presence of fragmentation at the same location for each of the other reported populations. A post hoc Bonferroni correction was then applied to reduce the risk of error associated with multiple statistical tests being performed. Signi cance was set at P <0.05. Odds ratio and 95% con dence intervals were calculated for each comparison to determine the likelihood of a positive outcome (UK TB more likely to have a site of fragmentation than the comparison population). The remaining epidemiological information was recorded as descriptive summaries only. Results A total of 174 horses satis ed the inclusion criteria and these comprised 83 males, 58 females and 33 geldings. There were3 yearlings, 103 2-year-olds, 46 3-year-olds, 16 4-year-olds and6 horses 5 years old. Of all horses included in the study, 45% (78) had unilateral carpal arthroscopy and 55% (96) subsequent to bilateral carpalradiographic evaluation. Negative arthroscopic ndings (e.g. no sites of fragmentation identi ed) were present in one limb in 56 (58%) of those horses evaluated bilaterally. Carpal osteochondral fragmentation was found at 291 sites; 224 (77%) sites of fragmentation were identi ed in the middle carpal (MCj) and 67 (23%) in the antebrachiocarpal joints (ABCj). In 130 (75%) horses, fragmentation was identi ed in the MCj only, in 39 (22%) horses the ABCj only and in 5 (3%) horses both the MCj and ABCjs were affected. A single site of fragmentation was identi ed in a total of 171 carpal joints (76% MCj; 24% ABCj), 2 54 joints (85% MCj; 15% ABCj) and 3 sites of fragmentation in 4 joints (25% MCj; 75% ABCj). The relative frequency distribution (%) of the sites of fragmentation in this study is demonstrated in Table 1 alongside the frequency distributions for other published TABLE 1: Statistical comparison of location of osteochondral carpal fragments in UK Thoroughbreds compared with US Thoroughbreds, Quarter Horses and Standardbreds (Palmer 1986; McIlwraith et al. 1987; Lucas et al. 1999) and AUS Thoroughbreds (Raidal and Wright 1996) Fragment locationUK TB vs. US TB TB vs. valueOdds 95% P valueOdds ratio 95% P CI 0.8 -1.7 DDiCi 0.4 0.5 0.2 -0.9 0.07 0.4 0.2 -0.8 0.3 3.9 1.1 -14.5 0.8 2.0 0.9 -4.6 3.4 1.0 -67.3 0.1 -1.90 0.5 <0.0001* 0.3 3.9 0.0 -0.1 0.2 0.5 -1.16 Left limb 0.001* 1.7 1.2 -2.1 0.04* 1.3 1.0 -1.7 -- - - - - Right limb 0.001* 0.6 0.5 -0.8 0.04* 0.8 0.6 -1.0 -- - - - - UK lesion more likely if odds ratio >1.

Supplementary Item 1 summarises speci c fragment location distributions for each population.Fragmentation was identi ed bilaterally in 57 (33%) horses and unilaterally in 117 (67%) horses, of which 78 (67%) horses were evaluated unilaterally and 39 (33%) bilaterally with negative arthroscopic ndings in one limb. A total of 42 of 57 (74%) of the horses bilaterally affected had at least one location where fragments were located at the same site between limbs; the most common bilaterally symmetric site of fragmentation was the dorsodistal radial carpal (DDiCr) bone (32/42; 76%). Where 3 sites of fragmentation were identi ed the most common combination was paired sites of DDiCr bone fragmentation with a single site of dorsoproximal third carpal (DPrC3) bone fragmentation (14/25; 56%). Comparison of data from the current study with frequency distributions reported in US TBs, QHs and SBs (Palmer 1986; McIlwraith et al. 1987; Lucas et al. 1999) and AUS TBs (Raidal and Wright 1996) is shown in Table 1 and Figs 1 -3, with speci c population comparisons including odds ratios and con dence intervals presented in Supplementary Items 2 -5. The UK TBs were 1.7 and 1.8 times more likely to have sites of DDiCr bone fragmentation and 3.5 and 8.7 times more likely to have DPrC3 bone fragmentation than US TBs and QHs respectively. In addition, the UK population were less likely to have ABCj pathology, but 3.3 and 3.9 times more likely to have MCj pathology compared to the US TBs and QHs, respectively. Finally, UK TBs were 1.7 and 1.3 times more likely to suffer from left forelimb injuries and less likely to suffer from right forelimb injuries than the US TB and QH populations reported. The UK population had single sites of fragmentation in 52% (91/174) of cases, which is similar to US QHs (162/349 horses, 46% single sites). The US TBs had a lower prevalence for single site of fragmentation (87/220 horses, 40%) (McIlwraith et al. 1987) than identi ed in the UK population reported here. In comparing the UK TBs with US SBs (Palmer 1986; Lucas et al. 1999), the former were 8.4 times more likely to have sites of dorsoproximal radial carpal (DPrCr) bone fragmentation, 15.6 times more likely to have dorsoproximalintermediate carpal (DPrCi) bone fragmentation, 47.2 times more likely to have dorsolateral distal radial (DLDiR) fragmentation and 8.42 times more likely to have dorsomedial distal radial (DMDiR) fragmentation than US SBs. The ABCj was 19.7 times more likely to be affected in UK TBs and the MCj less likely to be affected compared to US SBs. European and AUS racing TBs appear to have similar distributions of sites of carpal fragmentation (Raidal and Wright 1996); no differences in location of fragmentation distribution were identi ed. Comparisons between left and right limbs were not made for AUS TBs or US SBs as no comparable data were available. Discussion This study documents the frequency distribution of sites ofcarpal fragmentation in a population of flat racing TBs in the UK admitted to a single referral hospital. Several incitingfactors for osteochondral fragmentation have previouslybeen described and should be considered when assessingthe differences in distribution from geographically distinct TBsand other populations of racehorses. These include skeletal 60 TBUS QH US SB AUS TB Fig Relative frequency distribution of sites of arthroscopically conrmed osteochondral fragmentation in UK flat racing Thoroughbreds compared with other populations of flat racing horses. 120 100 80604020 0 MCj ABCj Site of fragmentation specific US TBUS QH US SB AUS TBRelative frequency (%) Fig 2: Relative frequency distribution of joints containing arthroscopically con rmed osteochondral fragments in reported populations of flat racing horses.

Severity of joint disease may advance with persistence of fragmentation within the joint and sites of secondary damage may develop as a consequence on adjacent, or with displaced fragments, on remote articular surfaces (McIlwraith et al. 2014). Radial carpal, Ci and C3 are perceived to undergo the greatest loading of the 6 axial weightbearing carpal bones (Bramlage et al. 1988; Ruggles 2012). Intercarpal articulations are arranged so that this load is partially dissipated bytransferring force to the intercarpal ligaments by mediolateraldisplacement of the bones. This protects the articularsurfaces, but requires conditioning of the ligaments throughtraining. Similarly, the capacity of the palmar joint capsule,ligaments and flexor muscles to limit compression of the dorsal aspect of the joint in hyperextension must bedeveloped through conditioning exercise. These self-protective properties are anticipated to increase with ageand training (Bramlage et al. 1988). In this study, involvement of the MCj was more likely in UK TBs than US TBs and QHs (McIlwraith et al. 1987) but less likely than in US SBs (Palmer 1986; Lucas et al. 1999). Similarities in frequency distributions of speci c locations of fragmentation within the MCj were recognised between UK and AUS TBs(Raidal and Wright 1996), which suggests aetiological factorscommon to both populations. In both the UK and AUS,training is typically on arti cial or turf surfaces with the majority of racing on turf (Anon 2014a). Race distances andspeeds are similarly distributed in relation to age and gender.No statistical differences were identi ed between the two populations; the only difference recorded was that in UK TBsthe DPrCr represented 4.5% of the total sites of fragmentationidenti ed, whereas AUS TBs had no DPrCr bone involvement reported (Raidal and Wright 1996). It has been proposed that injury to the ABCj is more likely to be an acute, hyperextension overload rather than thechronic repetitive stress injury which more typically involvesthe MCj (Bramlage et al. 1988). Forelimb kinematic studies of TBs at different paces have shown that with increasing speedthe protraction phase of the stride remains constant whilst thestance phase of the stride decreases, resulting in anincreased stride frequency (Witte et al. 2006). Maximal carpal extension has also been shown to increase linearly withspeed and gradient (Burn et al. 2006), suggesting that injury to the ABCj is more likely to occur in horses exercising at higher speeds. This infers that horses training at greater speeds, such as the US TB and QH are more likely to have both a greater degree and higher frequency of carpal hyperextension than those training at slower speeds (Witte et al. 2006), increasing the risk of fragmentation within the ABCj. The reported frequency distribution of carpal chip fractures in Japanese TBs identi ed a high proportion of distal radius fragmentation (Shimozawa et al. 2000). The data presented could not be directly compared to frequency distributions in the UK, US and AUS populations reported in this study, but distinct differences are evident. In the Japan study 47.8% of all fragmentation involved the distal radius, 28.6% DPrC3 and 9.8% DDiCi. No other population offlat racing horses in the literature presents such a high proportion of distal radius lesions or such a low prevalence ofCr involvement. If the previously discussed pathogenic proposals are accepted then the Japanese TBs, which race at speeds greater than the European and AUS TBs on turf (Anon 2014b), appear to suffer more 'acute 'hyperextension injuries than similar populations elsewhere in the world. In all reported groups except the Japanese population (Shimozawa et al. 2000) DDiCr lesions were most frequent, accounting for almost half of all sites of fragmentation in UK and AUS TBs and US SBs (Palmer 1986; McIlwraith et al. 1987; Raidal and Wright 1996; Lucas et al. 1999). The high prevalence of fragmentation of the DDiCr bone and opposing radial facet of the DPrC3 bone individually, paired, or in cases of multiple sites of fragmentation, appears to be related to the medial position of these bones. It has been suggested that the medial aspect of the carpus may be more susceptible to injury as it is less protected by overlying muscle and tendon, undergoes greater loading (Bramlage et al. 1988; Barr 1994) and is less able to attenuate weightbearing stress by transfer of load by interosseous displacement through intercarpal ligaments (Bramlage et al. 1988). Sites of DPrC3 bone fragmentation were most common in US SB, followed by UK and AUS TB. The US TB and QH have relatively low prevalences of DPrC3 bone fragmentation compared with UK TBs and US SBs. Training regimens in US SBs, which comprise longer periods of slower, lower intensity exercise (Lucas et al. 1999) may be a risk factor for fragmentation in the MCj. Standardbreds race at trot orpace, pulling a sulky rather than carrying a jockey. This reduces vertical loading forces through the forelimb, displaces the centre of gravity caudally and reduces loading of the carpus in the stance phase (Lucas et al. 1999). At slower speeds the stance phase has a greater duration (Witte et al. 2006), during which the carpus is loaded. In each stride, the third carpal bone is therefore loaded for longer at slower speeds, which may be associated with the chronic bony changes documented in the US SB (Lucas et al. 1999; Hopper et al. 2004). In the current study, 42/57 (74%) of multiple sites of carpal fragmentation were symmetrically paired. Of the total population, sites of fragmentation were identi ed in 165 (57%) left and 126 (43%) right limbs. This differs from studies in the US, NZ and AUS which have documented a higher prevalence in right carpi (McIlwraith et al. 1987; Kannegieter and Burbidge 1990; Raidal and Wright 1996). Geographical limb bias has also been demonstrated within Australia where there is a difference between territories in sidedness of affected limbs according to racing direction (Raidal and Wright 1996). A weakness of this study was that 45% of the total number of horses undergoing surgery did not have both limbs evaluated arthroscopically. Identi cation of all limbs affected and total number of sites of fragmentation may therefore be underestimated. However, all horses underwent bilateral radiographic examination and all joints with radiographically identi able sites of fragmentation were evaluated arthroscopically. Of horses which underwent bilateral arthroscopy, 58% had fragmentation identi ed in one limb only. In summary, the results reported support the hypothesis that distribution of carpal osteochondral fragmentation in this UK TB population differs from comparable populations of flat racing horses elsewhere in the world. Differences may stem from factors such as conformation, training surfaces and \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd277 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017regime and race speeds and distances imposed by thedifferences in the type of racing populations and theirrelative geographical locations.

A. Allbaugh Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Ames, USA. Corresponding author email: uveitis (ERU) is a vision-threatening oculardisease that practitioners must be able to identify andmanage. Although not every case of acute uveitis willdevelop into ERU, if 2 or more episodes of uveitis areobserved, a diagnosis of ERU can be made. Patient outcomesimprove with early diagnosis, appropriate therapy and clienteducation. Recent advances in surgical options andtreatment of horses with ERU have improved success inmanaging this condition. New therapeutic strategies underinvestigation may further enhance results and reduce thedevelopment of complicating factors. Introduction The uveal tract is the vascular tissue in the eye, consisting ofthe iris, ciliary body and choroid. In flammation of these structures is termed uveitis and is the most common causeworldwide of equine blindness (Schwink 1992; Gilger andDeeg 2011; Hollingsworth 2011). Causes of primary, acuteuveitis include local and systemic infectious diseases, blunt orpenetrating trauma, neoplasia and idiopathic or immune-mediated in flammation. The acute form of uveitis can affect any horse so it is important to distinguish primary, acute uveitis from the chronic, recurrent form and not assume that every case of uveitis in a horse is equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) as diagnostic testing, management and prognostic considerations differ (Gilger 2013). Prevalence and aetiology Equine recurrent uveitis, also known as moon blindness orperiodic ophthalmia, has a prevalence of 2 -25%, 8 -10% and <1% in the United States (US), Europe and United Kingdom (UK), respectively. Differences are presumed to be due to genetic and environmental factors (Deeg et al. 2002a,b; Gilger and Deeg 2011; Mitchell 2014). It is characterised byepisodes of persistent or recurrent intraocular in flammation that typically develop months after an initial uveitis episodesubsides. A uveitis episode recurring within only a few weeksmay be ERU, or may simply represent unresolved primary,acute uveitis if the underlying cause was not identi ed and managed appropriately, or if therapy was not continued for2-4 weeks past the resolution of clinical signs. The ERU condition is known to be a T-helper type 1 immune-mediated disease that occurs when disruption ofthe blood-ocular barrier allows CD4 +T lymphocytes to enter the eye and their presence leads to repeated or persistentepisodes of uveitis through recognition of self-antigens(Romeike et al. 1998; Gilger et al. 2012; Malalana et al. 2015). Although leptospirosis is the most commonly implicated ERU initiator (Sillerud et al. 1987; Dwyer et 2000; Wollanke et al. 2001; Brandes et al. 2007) and numerous investigations have been performed to further elucidate its role in disease (Halliwell et al. 1985; Matthews et al. 1987; Brem et al. 1999; Rohrbach et al. 2010; Verma and Stevenson 2012; Polle et al. 2014), other infectious and noninfectious aetiologies may also trigger ERU including past ocular trauma and Deeg 2011; Gerding and Gilger 2016) and Leptosporosis remains to be identi ed as a cause of ERU in the UK. Initiating or persisting infection alone does not suf ciently explain the clinical course or therapeutic response and recurrent episodes appear to result from epitope spreading (Deeg et al. 2006a; Deeg 2008). The primary uveitis cause, environmental in fluences and genetic make-up of the individual play a role in thedevelopment of this immune-mediated disease to ERU; however, the disease couldimpact any breed with Quarter Horses and/or Thoroughbredlineage-breeds commonly affected due to populationnumbers. Genetic markers for ERU risk have been identi ed in Appaloosas and German Warmblood horses (Kulbrock et al. 2013a; Fritz et al. 2014). Coat colour within breeds is also a factor. The Leopard complex spotting locus is associated withinsidious ERU in Appaloosas (Fritz et al. 2014) and brown or black Warmbloods are more often affected than those ofother colours (Kulbrock et al. 2013b). No gender predilection has been proven, but 2 recent retrospective studiesdocumented a signi cant overrepresentation of male horses (Kulbrock et al. 2013b; Gerding and Gilger 2016). The age of onset is variable, yet many cases present during mid-adult prime performance years (Dwyer et al. 1995; Gilger 2013; Gerding and Gilger 2016). Disease is unilateral inapproximately 50% of horses, except for the Appaloosabreed with 80 -87% bilateral ERU (Mitchell 2014; Gerding and Gilger 2016). Initial ocular signs such as intermittent squinting,tearing, or cloudiness may be noted by owners weeks,months, or years prior to eventual presentation due topersistent signs of ocular pain, a change in appearance tothe eyes, or vision compromise. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd279 EQUINE VETERINARY / AE / appearance and classi cation Clinical signs and ndings are highly variable depending on ERU chronicity and clinical syndrome. The 3 stages of ERU are active, quiescent and end-stage. The active stage involves acute flare-ups of uveitis showing observable pain and blood-ocular barrier breakdown in flammation and detachment ( Fig 1 ). The quiescent stage occurs after an active flare-up resolves and may last for weeks, months or greater than a year. During this period, eyes appear comfortable and have no evidence of active uveitis. Indicators of previous in flammatory episodes such as posterior synechia, pigment rests on the anterior lens capsule (i.e. 'footprints of synechia '), iris ( Fig 2 ). End-stage eyes are irreversibly blind manifest with bulbi, pupillary seclusion,blinding cataracts, luxated lenses and/or retinal detachments(Figs 3 -7and Supplementary Item 1 ). The disease is further classi ed by the clinical syndrome (classic, insidious, or posterior ERU) (Gilger and Deeg 2011; Gilger 2013). Classic ERU is the most common manifestation. It involves active observable in flammatory episodes followed by quiet periods, as described above and can occur in anyhorse. Recurrent episodes of classic ERU develop ocularchanges that can lead to end-stage disease. Insidious ERUinvolves low-grade uveitis without apparent common in Appaloosas and Draught breeds. Detailedveterinary examination is necessary to identify the subtlesigns of this smouldering in flammation which may go unnoticed by owners until cataract, vision de cits or end- stage disease are present. Posterior ERU affects the vitreous and retina with little to no signs of anterior uveitis and most commonly affects Warmbloods, Draught breeds and European horses.Knowledge of ERU syndrome and stage classi cation impacts prognosis and treatment recommendations, as detailed below, but making an accurate diagnosis is imperative for appropriate therapy. Examination and clinical aids Ophthalmic examination should begin by assessing generaleyelid and globe position, retroillumination, pupil size andsymmetry, direct and consensual pupillary light re flexes and menace responses. If the menace response is not present adazzle re flex can be performed in a dim light setting using a bright light source (e.g. LED light on most mobile phones) toassess for retina and optic nerve function. Intraocular pressureshould ideally be documented with an applanation orrebound tonometer ( Fig 8 ). 15 - 30 mmHg, with uveitic eyes typically 5 -12 mmHg and glaucomatous eyes above 35 mmHg (Miller et al. 1990; Knollinger et al. 2005). Sedation and periocular nerve blocks are used for examination of painful or uncooperative horses.Fluorescein staining is imperative to assess for corneal ulcers Fig 1: An active ERU episode presenting with ocular conjunctival and episcleral blood vessel congestion, mild diffuse cornealoedema and a relatively miotic pupil given the dim lightexamination setting. A mild degree of aqueous flare is also present that contributes to the generally hazy appearance of theeye. Re flections are present on the corneal surface that are artifactual and not associated with ocular disease.

Pupils should be dilated with tropicamide to allowfor vitreal and Activeuveitis or posterior synechia may prevent full mydriasis;however, such impediments to dilation may reveal clinicalndings supportive of ERU, reiterating the value of attempting pharmacological dilation. A dark setting is necessary for identi cation of some clinical ndings associated with ERU, such as aqueous flare, keratic precipitates, or faint cataracts. If an enclosedstructure is not available for eld examinations either work under a dense shade tree, place a large blanket overthe heads of the horse and examiner, or schedule theexamination at a dark time of the day. Aqueous flare is the hallmark of anterior uveitis. It is diagnosed by shining abright focal light source (e.g. direct ophthalmoscope set onthe smallest circle beam) into the eye held very close to thecornea ( <1 cm away) while examining from a perpendicular angle. Aqueous flare is visualised as a beam of lightcontinuing through the anterior chamber to connect the cornea and lens and is graded based on intensity (Hogan et al. 1959). This space should be clear in normal eyes and the technique can be practiced in healthy horses. Keratic precipitates may be found on the ventral corneal endothelium and can be viewed with direct illumination usingmagni cation. Small cataracts associated with ERU are commonly located in the lens cortex. They may be associated with posterior synechia or pigment rests on the lens surface and will be more easily visualised after Fig 5: A horse presenting for cataract evaluation. The left eye had complete lens opaci cation, corpora nigra degeneration, lateral posterior synechia and diffuse iris hyperpigmentation.Recurrent bouts of previous in flammation were reported consistent with ERU and an ocular ultrasound revealed a retinaldetachment. Fig 6: Fundic image showing the optic nerve on the left side ofthe picture with radiating white folds indicative of retinaldetachment. The view is hazy due to unclear ocular mediacommon with ERU. The eye was irreversibly blind but remainedcomfortable with medical management of the uveitis. LAT -1 -2x -3 Fig 7: Ultrasound image of an eye with a detached retina due to ERU. The hyperechoic line visible in the vitreous is theneurosensory retina that has detached from the back of the eyebut remains attached centrally at the optic nerve andperipherally at the ora. Fig 4: Chronic end-stage ERU. The eye has a diffusely hyperpigmented iris, extensive posterior synechia and a complete cataract. The pupil aperture is greatly reduced by theadhesions and nearly secluded. \u00a92016 Anterior subcapsular lens opacitiesare noted with predominantly anterior uveitis, while primarilyposterior changes are seen with posterior ERU and bothlocations may be affected with panuveitis. Vitrealinflammation (hyalitis) manifests as vitreal cellular in ltrate, vitreal debris and/or a yellow/green hue to the vitreous (Fig 9 ). Fundic evaluation may reveal active chorioretinitis lesions retinal oedema, chorioretinal present in eyes with other clinical ndings of ERU may be associated with historic disease; however, depigmented punctate lesions or peripapillaryscarring may also be considered incidental ndings in the absence of other signs and are not pathognomonic for ERU(Matthews et al. 1990; Mathes et al. 2012). Retroillumination is the technique of aligning an examiner 's gaze with a light shone into the eyes of the patient from approximately 3 feet away to result in a fundic reflex. This can be done prior to dilation to help assess pupil size, symmetry and general optical axis clarity but should also be done after dilation to help identify keratic precipitates, cataracts, vitreal opacities, or other subtle imperfections which may be more easily highlighted. Eyes with a fundic reflex visible on retroillumination but lacking a menace response, PLR, or dazzle re flex likely have irreversible retinal or optic nerve damage. Detachment of the retina, whether diagnosed on ophthalmic examination or ocular ultrasound, is a grave prognosis for vision (see Figs 6 ,7and Supplementary Item 1 ) (Strobel et al. 2007).Phthisis bulbi is shrinking of the globe seen secondary to severe or prolonged uveitis and may be evidenced by prominent scleral show, corneal wrinkling, diffuse brosis and a lack of PLR or dazzle re flexes (see Fig 3 ). These changes are consistent with end-stage disease that may have occurred due to any form of ERU. Differential diagnoses Nonspeci c signs of ocular pain include blepharospasm, epiphora and photophobia. These are symptoms clients mayrecognise with classic ERU, but they could also be due toconjunctival foreign bodies, corneal ulcers, or corneal stromalabscesses. Evaluation of the ocular surface during anexamination can exclude these differential diagnoses. Clientsshould be instructed to seek immediate veterinary evaluationand not apply a topical corticosteroid if signs of ocular painoccur as it could exacerbate a newly formed corneal ulcer(Fig 10 ). When diffuse corneal oedema is present in a painful eye with or without corneal vascularisation, a cream-coloured corneal stromal abscess may be present andcorticosteroids should not be administered. Diffuse cornealoedema associated with elevated IOP is diagnostic forglaucoma and commonly associated with ERU in horses, butrequires additional management (Wilkie 2010; Utter andBrooks 2011; Annear et al. 2012). Diagnostic testing Fluorescein staining should be performed on every horsepresenting with ocular complaints. Horses with ERU that arestain negative with no other signs of primary corneal diseasecan be treated with standard medical therapy as detailedbelow. Tonometry is useful to aid diagnosis and monitoring ofERU or secondary glaucoma. A physical examination shouldbe performed to identify signs of general illness and ensurethere are no contraindications with planned medicaltreatment. Fig 8: Intraocular pressure measurement using a TonoVet rebound tonometer.1The eyelid is gently held open with pressure on the orbital rim instead of the eyeball to avoid artifactualelevation of intraocular pressure and the tonometer probeoriented perpendicular to the ocular surface. The normal valuefor a horse is 15 -30 mmHg. Fig 9: The vitreous has a yellow-green appearance in this horse with uveitis as a result of serum pigments ventrally, dark faint multifocal lens opacities arealso present. EVJ Ltd282EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017Additional diagnostic tests to consider include a complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry pro le and testing for speci c aetiological agents. The CBC and serum chemistry pro le may help to identify concurrent or associated systemic disease or more commonly serve as anormal baseline prior to initiating therapy. Notably, plasmabrinogen and serum amyloid A are not useful biomarkers for uveitis (Labelle et al. 2011). Leptospirosis serology can be performed on serum and ocular fluids by microscopic agglutination test (MAT). The most commonly tested serovarsinclude L. bratislava, L. canicola, L. pomona . Titres of 1:400 or greater are considered positive, but the value of a single positive serological specimen is limited so paired sera samples 2-3 weeks apart are preferred with a 4-fold rise being diagnostic (Verma et al. 2013). If both serum and aqueous humour or vitreous are tested, the ratio of ocular to serum antibody concentrations can be calculated (C value) for each serovar and a value greater than 4 is indicative of intraocular Leptospira antibody production (Gilger et al. 2008). Ocular fluids may also be tested with real-time PCR to detect the presence of leptospirosis DNA. Leptospira culture is not recommended for clinical cases due to the lack of sensitivity and length of culture (Polle et al. 2014). If an eye must be removed due to chronic pain and blindness, ocular histopathology can be performed to look for pathognomonic ERU lesions; however, aetiological agents are rarely identi ed (Cooley et al. 1990; Dubielzig et al. 1997). Medical therapy Active uveitis initially warrants aggressive treatment, withtherapy slowly tapered and discontinued 2 -4 weeks past the resolution of signs as con rmed by ophthalmic recheck examinations ( Fig 11 ). The goals of therapy are to reduce pain and preserve vision. The most critical component of treatment is anti-in flammatory therapy. neomycin/polymyxin B/dexamethasone) should be given 4 times daily or even more frequently if needed to control the uveitis. Ophthalmic hydrocortisone and sodium phosphate steroid preparations are less effective due to poor intraocular penetration. Subconjunctival triamcinolone, which has effects over 2 -3 weeks, is not effective as monotherapy and may predispose to bacterial infection or melting if a corneal ulcer develops. Concurrent topical nonsteroidal anti- 0.09% 3 -4 times daily may be needed in severe cases or can be utilised if corticosteroid therapy is contraindicated by corneal ulcers or calci c band keratopathy. Flunixin meglumine appears to be the most effective systemic NSAID (Gilger and Michau 2004) with initial treatment recommended at 1.1 mg/kg bwt twice daily for 3 days then once daily for one week or longer. Injectable 5% solution is inexpensive and may be given by mouth with good absorption and bioavailability (Pellegrini- Masini et al. 2004). An oral dosing syringe can be coated with a palatable substance to help mitigate the bitter taste of the injectable solution. Other systemic anti-in flammatories such as phenylbutazone, rocoxib, aspirin, prednisolone, or dexamethasone are either less effective or have greater risk of side effects, with systemic steroids reserved for severe, nonresponsive cases (Gilger and Michau 2004). Topical ophthalmic atropine 1% should be given once to twice daily to dilate the pupil (reducing the risk of blinding synechiae),alleviate ciliary muscle spasm and help stabilise the blood- aqueous barrier. Severe cases may require atropine treatment up to 4 times daily, but clients should closely monitor for inappetence, lethargy, reduced faecal output, or more profound signs of colic as ileus is an idiosyncratic reaction in some horses (Williams et al. 2000). Horses with frequently recurring ERU may bene t from long-term maintenance using a topical NSAID daily and/or topical atropine weekly. If an active leptospiral infection is suspected, systemic antibiotics (doxycycline hyclate 10 mg/kg bwt per os twice daily for 4 weeks, minocycline hydrochloride 4 mg/kg bwt per osonce daily for or enro floxacin 7.5 mg/kg bwt per osonce daily for 3 weeks) may also be administered, but ocular penetration and ef cacy is questionable (Gilmour et al. 2005; Divers et al. 2008; Popp et al. 2013). A recent study reported that systemic antibiotic therapy had minimal effect on visual outcome in horses with leptospirosis- associated ERU as a positive titre may not indicate active infection but rather prior exposure (Gerding and Gilger 2016). Vaccination against leptospirosis as adjunctive treatment for ERU is not supported at this time (Rohrbach et al. 2005). Intravitreal injections and surgical treatment Severe or frequently recurring ERU cases may require treatmentby intravitreal injections, vitrectomy, or suprachoroidalcyclosporine implantation. The choice of advanced treatmentwill depend on the accessible options and ERU clinicalsyndrome. Intravitreal injection is an inexpensive technique that can be performed with standing sedation and appropriate sterilepreparation. Low dose gentamicin (4 mg intravitreally) hasbeen previously reported (Gilger and Michau 2004) and arecent preliminary study showed promising results for use in Fig 10: Epiphora and blepharospasm are present in this horse with historic ERU episodes. The client started empiric treatment4 days prior with a topical steroid but signs did not resolve and afungal corneal ulcer was diagnosed on veterinary examination asthe cause of the ocular pain symptoms. This reiterates theimportance of veterinary evaluation with the onset of clinicalsigns as corticosteroid use may be contraindicated. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd283EQUINE AE or persistent posterior uveitis cases with notableclinical improvement within 1 -3 days (McMullen 2015). Intravitreal dexamethasone (1 -2 mg) or triamcinolone acetonide (5 -10 mg) may also be considered; however, they may predispose to microbial infection (Yi et al. 2008; Gerding and Gilger 2016). Rapamycin (10 mg/eye) appears to be safe, but clinical studies are needed to establish ef cacy in ERU (Douglas et al. 2008). Pars plana vitrectomy, although of limited bene t in North America, is commonly performed in parts of mainland Europe, notably Germany, for horses with posterior uveitis to clear the visual axis of vitreal opacities and remove inflammatory mediators with 85% maintenance of vision reported (Fr \u20acuhauf et al. 1998). It is most bene cial for Leptospira-associated ERU and may not be recommended for horses testing negative for L. interrogans antibodies given signi cantly less clinical bene t( T\u20acom\u20acordy et al. 2010). Despite success in relieving pain and preventing ERU recurrence, eyesundergoing vitrectomy may become blind due to retinal detachment, or progressive cataract (Fr \u20acuhauf et al. 1998; von Borstel et al. 2005). Given that ERU is a T cell mediated disease, the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine has been investigated. Although topical therapy cannot penetrate the ocular surface, suprachoroidal cyclosporine implant placement allows achievable intraocular drug levels for over 3 years (Gilger et al. 2006). The implant is placed deep within the sclera in contact with the choroid ( Fig 12 and Supplementary Item 2 ). Horses that can be controlled with standard medical therapy, but have frequent recurrences or early relapse of active ERU after being gradually tapered off medications are considered ideal candidates (Gilger et al. 2010). In a review of 151 operated eyes, frequency of uveitic episodes was dramatically reduced and vision maintained in 70% of eyes 5 or more years after surgery (Gilger et al. 2010). Although surgery appears to reduce vision loss by approximately one half in all ERU horses, Appaloosa horses especially bene ted as vision loss was only 12% in eyes that received the implant (Gilger et al. 2010). Ocular diseases secondary to ERU Eyes that present with additional changes secondary to ERUmay need supplemental therapy or referral to a specialist. Calci c band keratopathy Calci c band keratopathy manifests as grey to white mineral depositions in the super cial cornea along the interpalpebral central region and may include fluorescein positive corneal ulcers (Rebhun et al. 1993; Brooks 2012). Topical steroid use has been associated with its development in both man and horses (Rebhun et al. 1993; Taravella et al. 1994; Schl \u20acotzer- Schrehardt et al. 1999; Brooks 2012). Treatment includes cessation of corticosteroid therapy and the addition of a topical calcium chelator such as dipotassiumethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA 1% ointment 3 times daily) to decrease tear lm and tissue free calcium levels (Brooks 2008). Chelation with EDTA 3.75% following epithelial debridement may cause calcium dissolution (Najjar et al. a) b) Fig 11: a) Active ERU episode in a blue-eyed horse with episcleral and conjunctival blood vessel injection, miosis,yellowing of the previously blue iris and engorged iris bloodvessels ventrally and near the pupil margin dorsally. b) Same eyeas shown in (a) one week following treatment with uveitiscontrolled and the iris a normal blue colour (dark areas medialand lateral are normal heterochromia irides colouration). Irisblood vessels remain visible and are likely within a preiridal brovascular membrane. Medications were gradually tapered over subsequent weeks following con rmation of in flammation control. Fig 12: Surgical suprachoroidal cyclosporine implant placementdorsolaterally underneath a scleral flap in this left eye to reduce the frequency and severity of ERU episodes. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd284EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 20172004). When corneal ulcers occur due to the mineralisation,topical antibiotics, atropine and a systemic NSAID areindicated. In rare cases, diamond burr debridement orsuper cial keratectomy may be considered to facilitate healing (Rebhun et al. 1993; Brooks 2012; Lassaline-Utter et al. 2014). Topical NSAID and EDTA therapy should be prescribedfor ERU-affected horses developing early signs of calci c band keratopathy while monitoring for worsening ofmineralisation and ERU. Cataracts Small cataracts that develop with ERU may not impact visionbut should be monitored for progression. Eyes with completecataracts that prevent posterior segment examination mayhave ocular ultrasonography performed hyperechoic vitreal line extending from theora ciliaris retina to the optic nerve is diagnostic for retinaldetachment (See Fig 7 and Supplementary Item 1 ). It has been previously stated that horses with complete cataractsdue to ERU are not good candidates for cataract surgerydue to pre-existent in flammatory changes. A recent study con rmed ERU eyes that underwent cataract surgery were signi cantly less likely to be visual (25%) than horses without preoperative ERU (65%) at the last post operative follow-up (Edelmann et al. 2014). However, another report showed no difference in ERU and non-ERU eyes following cataract surgery with a similar visual outcome of 37% greater than 2 years post operatively (Brooks et al. 2014). Individual horse ocular status and surgeon preference will dictate if cataract surgery is an option in a patient with historic ERU. Glaucoma Horses with uveitis are at risk for glaucoma and ERU is themost common cause of equine glaucoma (Annear et al. 2012; Curto et al. 2014). Clinical examination of the equine iridocorneal angle is possible medially and laterally with someERU eyes showing scarring or brosis that may predispose to glaucoma ( Fig 13 ). Horses with secondary glaucoma (high IOP or inappropriately high-normal IOP during active uveitis)can be medically treated. The medicaltreatments include topical 2%, dorzolamide 2% timolol0.5% product 2 -3 times daily (van der Woerdt et al. 2000; Willis et al. 2001; Germann et al. 2008; Tof flemire et al. 2014). Although atropine stabilises the blood-aqueous barrier and may reduce IOP in some horses, its use is not recommended in equine glaucoma unless daily IOP monitoring is possible due to the risk of compromising aqueous humour drainage (Herring et al. 2000; Utter and Brooks 2011). Semiconductor diode laser transcleral cyclophotocoagulation may be used to help reduce IOP in affected eyes and maintain vision, but does not eliminate the need for medications (Annear et al. 2010). Chemical ciliary body ablation can be performed by intravitreal injection in blind eyes af flicted with glaucoma to reduce pressure using gentamicin (25 -50 mg) and dexamethasone (1 mg) (K \u20aconig et al. 2003; Utter and Brooks 2011). Enucleation, evisceration, or other cosmetic globe surgeries could also be considered. A recent retrospective study reported that ERU horses with elevated IOP at initial presentation were at greater risk for blindness and/or enucleation than other horses despite attempted glaucoma therapy (Gerding and Gilger 2016).Prognosis and impact Equine recurrent uveitis has a poor long-term prognosis;however, chances of retaining vision can be improved withprompt diagnosis of in flammatory episodes, appropriate treatment and diligent monitoring. Appaloosas have thepoorest prognosis for vision when compared with otherbreeds and an 8 times greater predilection for ERU (Dwyeret al. 1995; Fritz et al. 2014), but suprachoroidal cyclosporine implant placement is especially bene cial in managing ERU in this breed (Gilger et al. 2010). A recent retrospective study of 224 ERU horses (338 eyes) documented rates of vision loss (46.9% of eyes, including 28.4% of eyes on initial examination), globe loss (12.1%), decreased performance (60.8%), transfer of ownership (19.1%), or even euthanasia (14.9%) (Gerding and Gilger 2016). The nancial impact of diagnosis and treatment ranged between $4000 and $8000 USD for most horses and nearly 85% of horse owners felt the value of their horsedecreased as a result of ERU (Gerding and Gilger 2016). Although these numbers may be biased by the population being referred and a greater proportion of rst line cases may be more effectively managed by veterinarians, the overall impact on individual horses, their owners and the equine industry as a whole is signi cant. Client education Clients should be informed about the potential for ERUwhenever a horse presents with uveitis since inciting causesmay be numerous; however, ERU should not be diagnoseduntil 2 or more episodes of uveitis are documented. Clientsshould also be told to contact a veterinarian for evaluation ifocular signs recur and should be cautioned against empirictreatment given the possibility of corneal ulceration, stromalabscessation, foreign body, or another condition presentingsimilarly. General health status should be monitored and aveterinarian contacted immediately if issues develop whilereceiving medical treatment for ERU as colic, colitis,gastrointestinal ulceration and other problems may beassociated with some treatments. Fig 13: The iridocorneal angle or 'grey line 'visible near the lateral limbus has become more brotic in appearance due to scarring of the trabecular meshwork. This change can be seenwith ERU and is not pathognomic for glaucoma but does warrant intraocular pressure monitoring. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd285 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MAY 2017Horses with ERU may have or develop visual de cits which owners should be informed of to allow for safe interactions and use. Breeding horses with ERU is not recommended given the potential genetic in fluences (Kulbrock et al. 2013a,b; Fritz et al. 2014). Genetic selection of individuals free of disease and not possessing risk markers may reduce the prevalence of ERU in the future. Conclusion Equine recurrent uveitis is the leading cause of vision loss inhorses. Accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment and closemonitoring will help to improve outcomes and maintainvision. When ERU persists or worsens despite seeminglyappropriate therapy, recurs frequently, or is simply beyondone 's capability for treatment, referral should be offered as an intravitreal injection or surgical treatment may bewarranted. Research is ongoing to determine more speci c information about the pathogenesis of ERU and newtherapeutic strategies are under investigation to aid clinicalmanagement.
