HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system . (The immune system fights infections and diseases in a person's body.) Over time, HIV weakens a person's immunesystem so it has a very hard time fighting diseases. HIV causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). People with HIV can have it for manyyears before it develops into AIDS. How is HIV spread? HIV is passed from person to person. This happens when a person with HIV gets his/her blood, semen,vaginal fluid, or breast milk inside another person's body. There is no risk of getting HIV from the person's urine, sweat, tears, saliva, or vomit unlessthere is also blood in it. A person of any age, sex, ethnic group, religion, economic background, or sexual orientation can getHIV. It is not who you are. It is what you do that puts you at risk. Anyone who shares needles, shares works to inject drugs, or has unprotected sex (sex without a condom) with someone who has HIV is at very high risk for getting infected. A mother with HIV can also pass the virus to her baby during pregnancy, during birth, or by breast feeding. It is not possible to tell if people have HIV by looking at them. People can have HIV for manyyears and not know they have it. They can also passHIV is a virus that hurts the body'simmune system. It is not who youare. It is whatyou do that putsyou at risk forgetting HIV.HIV: The Basics 1-3 9/03it to others without knowing it. That is why it is so important for people to get tested to find out if theyhave HIV. People with HIV who look and feel healthy, or have very low or undetectable (un d\u00eb tekt\u00b4 i bul) levels of virus , can still pass HIV to others. (See HIV: The Basics , How is my child's immune system watched? Measuring the amount of HIV inyour child's blood: viral load, page 1-8.) How does HIV affect a person's health? When people first get infected with HIV, they may or may not feel sick. Some get flu-like symptoms (simp\u00b4 toms), they may get a fever, sore throat, swollen glands, or a skin rash. These symptoms will go away without treatment, but HIV stays in theirblood where it grows and begins to destroy their immune system . People with HIV can have it for many years before their immune system gets weakand other symptoms appear. After symptoms appear, people with HIV will feel better with treatment. People with HIV may get sick more oftenand have illnesses that are harder to treat than people who do not have HIV. Sometimes people with HIV may get very sick.People who have HIV may not haveany symptomsfor years.1-4 HIV: The Basics 9/03Infants who were born with HIV or got HIV from their mother's breast milk may have symptoms that include: Islow to grow and gain weight. Islow learning to walk and talk. Ifrequent diarrhea (d\u00ef a), a lung infection. Iother infections that healthy children do not usually get. Infants with HIV may get sick more often and have illnesses that are harder to treat than other infants. How do people know they have HIV? HIV is most often diagnosed (d\u00ef ag n\u00f6st\u00b4) in adults and in children over 2 years old by tests that look for HIV antibodies (an\u00b4 t\u00eb bod \u00ebz). HIV antibodies are substances the immune system makes to fight HIV. If the test finds HIV antibodies, the test result is HIV positive . This means the person has HIV. At birth, all infants will have HIV antibodies in their blood if their mothers have HIV. Until infants are 6 to 18 months old, they have their mother's HIV antibodies. To find out if an infant has HIV, a bloodThere are tests that show ifsomeone has HIV.HIV: The Basics 1-5 9/03test called a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is done. A PCR test is different from an HIV antibody test. Rather than look for HIV antibodies, a PCR test looks for HIV in an infant's blood. In almost every case, the test can tell if the infant has HIV by thetime he/she is between 1 and 4 months old. If HIV is found, the PCR test will be positive. This means the infant has HIV. Special Note for Foster Parents: Make sure to keep your caseworker informed aboutfollow-up doctor visits for PCR testing . How does HIV attack a person's immune system? When HIV gets inside a person's body, it attacks his/her immune system . (The immune system fights infections and diseases.) The immune system has many kinds of white blood cells to fight infections. HIV finds the white blood cells, called CD4 cells . HIV gets inside the CD4 cell and makes copies of itself. Then, HIV kills the CD4 cell and the new HIV copies find other CD4 cells to get inside and start the cycle again. The immune system tries to control HIV by making more CD4 cells . But when the immune system cannot make CD4 cells fast enough, the amount of virus in the body goes up and the number of CD4 cells goes down. Because the immune system can no longer control HIV, the person can become sick. A weak immune system has a hard time fightingHIV kills immune system cells thathelp the Basics 9/03germs, even the germs that are around us all the time. These infections might last longer, be moresevere, and return more often in someone with a weak immune system. The picture below shows what happens in your child's body when HIV attacks your child's immune system . Think of the running water as HIV making copies of itself. Think of the drain as the immunesystem ( CD4 cells ) working to get rid of the virus . The clogged drain, or weak immune system, cannot get rid of HIV fast enough. The water goes up in thesink just the way the amount of HIV can go up in your child's blood. When this happens, your child has a high viral load . Adapted from \"Your Child, Your Family, and HIV\" published by the National Pediatric & Family HIV Resource Center at theUniversity of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.HIV: The Basics 1-7 9/03How is my child's immune system watched? You and your child's doctor(s) will watch your child's health in many ways. Your child's doctor will look for signs and symptoms of infections or other problems by ongoing health check-ups and bloodtests. These will tell the doctor if the HIV is getting stronger or weaker. They will also help the doctor find a problem early when it may be easier to treat. Ongoing medical check-ups Your child's doctor and clinic visits are important.These visits help the doctor or nurse see how yourchild is doing. Ongoing visits also help the doctor or nurse find health problems when they may be easier to treat. The doctor or nurse will give your child aphysical exam and talk with you and your child, if old enough, about changes in your child's health and behavior. He/she will ask you about how your childis doing at home, day care, or school. He/she will also ask about changes in your child's eating habits, sleeping habits, activity level, etc. Whenever you see a sudden change in your child's behavior, call the doctor. A sudden change may mean that your child needs help for a physical ormental problem.Your child's doctor will use ongoingcheck-ups andblood doctoror nurse find healthproblems whenthey may be easierto treat. Special Note for Foster Parents: As noted above, if you see sudden changes in your foster child's behavior, call the doctor and keep yourcaseworker informed.1-8 HIV: The Basics 9/03Measuring the amount of HIV in your child's blood: viral load One of the goals of treating HIV is to keep the amount of virus in your child's body as low as possible. To see how much virus is in your child'sblood, a viral load test will be done from time to time. Based on the test result, the doctor will know: Iif medicine is needed to help control HIV. Iif the medicine already being taken iscontrolling HIV. Iif other medicine is needed to control HIV. The test information will help the doctor suggest treatment options. When your child has a very low or undetectable viral load , he/she may not feel sick at all or may have fewer serious infections and illnesses related to HIV. Anyone with HIV, even if they have a low or undetectable viral load, can still pass HIV to others if their blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk get inside anotherperson's body. Measuring your child's immune system: CD4 cell counts Another way to see how well your child is doing is to check the number of CD4 cells he/she has. The CD4 cell blood test tells the doctor if your child's immune system is weak or strong. If his/her immune system is weak, the doctor may suggest medicines to help prevent some serious infections. By looking at both viral load and CD4 cell numbers, the doctor can find out a lot about your child's health.Your child will get blood tests fromtime to time tomeasure howmuch virus is inhis/her blood. Your child will also have blood testsdone from time totime to checkhis/her immunesystem. HIV: The Basics 9/03Checking your child's blood A complete blood count (CBC) is usually done at each doctor or clinic visit. The CBC is a blood test that counts the number of your child's red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets . IRed blood cells carry oxygen to cells in the child's body. IWhite blood cells fight infections. IPlatelets help control bleeding. Changes in your child's blood count can be caused by many things, such as HIV, another infection, or by a side effect from medicines. Checking your child's other body systems Other blood tests will be done from time to time to see how well your child's kidneys, liver, and other body systems are working. If your child has a health problem that cannot be diagnosed with blood tests, other tests may be needed. X-rays , ultrasounds , CT scans (computerized tomography), MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging), and PETs (positron emission tomography) are tests that show the doctor what is going on inside your child's body.Your child's doctor may have othertests done to cause of ahealth problem.1-10 HIV: The Basics 9/03What are the goals in treating HIV? The goals in treating HIV are to: Ilower the amount of virus in your child's blood. Iincrease the number of CD4 cells in your child's immune system . The sinks below may help show how HIV treatment works. Think of the running water as HIV making copies of itself. Think of the drain as the immunesystem (CD4 cells) working to get rid of the virus. Adapted from \"Your Child, Your Family, and HIV\" published by the National Pediatric & Family HIV Resource Center at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. HIV: The Basics 1-11 9/03The drain on the left shows HIV making many copies of itself. The clogged drain, or weak immune system , cannot get rid of HIV fast enough. The water goes up in the sink just the way the amount of HIV can go up in your child's blood. When thishappens, your child has a high viral load . The drain on the right shows what happens when HIV treatment is working. HIV stops or slows down making copies of itself. The unclogged drain, or strong immune system, can get rid of HIV. So the water goes down in the sink just the way the amountof HIV can go down in your child's blood. When this happens, your child has a low or undetectable viral load . How do medicines slow down or stop HIV? Experts have made medicines that work to stop HIV from getting inside white blood cells (CD4 cells ) or work to stop HIV from making copies of itself. These medicines are called antiretrovirals (an t\u00ef\u00b4 ret r\u00f6\u00b4 v\u00ef viral\" means the virus . Antiretroviral medicines can lower the amount of HIV in your child's blood. When the amount of HIV in yourchild's blood is low, it is much harder for HIV to make copies of itself. This means: Iyour child's medicines are working. Iyour child's immune system is stronger. Iyour child will have fewer illnesses.Antiretroviral medicines canslow or stop HIVfrom makingcopies of itself.1-12 HIV: The Basics 9/03Which medicines are best to take? In the beginning, there was only one medicine to fight HIV. So there was no choice about what medicine to take. Now, there are many medicines,and it is harder to decide. A group of HIV experts looked at all the research studies and came up with guidelines or plans. These plans help your child'sdoctor decide which medicines are best for your child. Deciding which medicines are best for your child depends on his/her: Ipast and present medical problems. Iantiretroviral medicines taken in the past. Iability to take each medicine on time. Iability to take medicine in liquid, pill or powder form. Iability to deal with the way the medicine tastes or feels in his/her mouth. Why do HIV medicines stop working? HIV is very smart. If given a chance , HIV will try to grow stronger. HIV will grow stronger very quickly when your child's:The doctor will recommendantiretroviralmedicines that arebest for your child. HIV will try tochange itself so itcan grow stronger.HIV: The Basics 1-13 9/03IHIV medicines are not taken correctly. IHIV medicine doses are missed. IHIV medicines do not work. When HIV grows stronger, your child's HIV medicine may stop working. HIV may be resistant (r\u00eb zis\u00b4 tant) to the HIV medicines your child takes. This means: Iyour child's medicines can no longer control HIV. IHIV will make more copies of itself. Iyour child's immune system will become weaker. Iyour child may have more infections and illnesses. Remember the running water and clogged drain on page 1-6. The clogged drain, or weak immune system, cannot get rid of HIV fast enough. The water goes up in the sinkjust the way the amount of virus goes up in your child's blood. Taking medicines everyday can be very hard . But for the medicines to do their best to control HIV, it is important for your child to take every HIV medicine dose correctly and on time. Your child's doctor or nurse should be called if there is a problem taking any of the medicines. You, your child, and your child's doctor or pharmacist (far\u00b4 ma sist) can work together to get the best medicine schedule for your child. If your child has a problem takingany of themedicines asdirected, call thedoctor or nurse. 1-14 HIV: The Basics 9/03How are some infections and illnesses prevented or treated? The best thing to do is prevent problems before they start. Sometimes, this can be done by giving your child medicines before an illness starts. Whether or not a preventive medicine is given depends on yourchild's health and immune system . Many times, your child's CD4 cell count is used to help decide if preventive medicine is needed and when to start.Preventive medicines may be used for illnesses such as PCP thrush . A child with a very weak immune system may need help to fight: Iserious infections, such as a lung infections (pneumonia ), blood infections ( sepsis ), and sinus infections ( sinusitis ). Imeasles .Special Note for Foster Parents: If your foster child has a problem taking any of his/her medicines, call the doctor or nurse and your caseworker. Some medicines can help preventillnesses beforethey start. A child with HIV who has a weakimmune systemmay get infectionsand illnesses thathealthy childrendo not get.HIV: The Basics 1-15 9/03What other illnesses or problems do children with HIV sometimes get? Children with HIV may get illnesses or have problems caused by: IHIV. Ia weak immune system . Imedicines. Anemia Anemia (a n\u00eb\u00b4 m\u00eb a) is common for children with HIV. Children are anemic (a n\u00eb\u00b4 mik) when the number of their red blood cells fall below normal. Red blood cells are important because they carry oxygen to different parts of the body. Children whoare anemic may be tired and pale or have no symptoms at all. Anemia is diagnosed by a blood test. Children most often become anemic from a low iron level, or from one of the antiretroviral medicines they are taking. If the anemia is caused by antiretroviral medicines, the doctor may treat theanemia by changing the medicine. If the anemia is caused by low iron levels, the doctor will treat it with iron vitamins. Herpes simplex virus Herpes simplex virus is also common among children with HIV. This virus causes common cold sores. The herpes simplex virus causes painful sores in and around the mouth of a child with HIV. Sometimes, when first infected with the herpessimplex virus, or when a child's immune system is1-16 HIV: The Basics 9/03weak, this virus can cause many painful blisters and a fever. The sores often make it difficult to eatand swallow. Herpes simplex virus can be treated, but may also come back. Usually when the infection returns, there are fewer sores in andaround the child's mouth. LIP LIP (lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis) is a serious lung disease that starts with shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing. The cause of LIP is not known. A chest X-ray may help the doctor make a diagnosis . LIP is usually treated with steroid medicines , as well as antiretroviral medicines to control the HIV. With treatment, LIP will improve greatly. Shingles Shingles are caused by the same virus as chicken pox. After having chicken pox, the virus can come back months or years later anywhere in the body and is often very painful. On a small area of the body,the skin breaks out in a rash or small blisters much like the chicken pox. Inside these little blisters is the chicken pox virus. Chicken pox can be spread toanother person who has not had the chicken pox by touching these blisters. Shingles usually go away in 1 - 2 weeks but can last longer and be more severewhen the child's immune system is weak. Shingles can come back either at the same place or a different place on a child's body.HIV: The Basics 1-17 9/03Fat redistribution Fat redistribution or lipodystrophy (lip \u00f6 dis\u00b4 tr\u00f6 f\u00eb) is a change in the way a person's body stores fat. These changes may include: Ilosing fat in a person's face, arms and legs. Igaining fat in a person's stomach or at the base ofhis/her neck. The cause of lipodystrophy is still being studied. If lipodystrophy is bothering your child, talk to your child's doctor. How are scientists finding new treatments for HIV? Scientists are still working hard to find new treatments and a cure for HIV. Research studies called clinical trials test new medicines and combinations of medicines to see which ones workthe best and which ones are the safest. These studies are offered by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG ). Without clinical trials, there would be no medicines to fight HIV. Medicines that are studied in clinical trials are used very carefully. Before anyone can be in a clinical trial, he/she mustfit the study requirements. Once in the study, the person must agree to follow the rules of the study. A person can stop a clinical trial at any time if he/shedoes not want to continue. As a parent or guardian , you must give permission for your child to be in a clinical trial. Again, themedicine and the study can be stopped if you feelNew medicines for treating HIV arebeing tested inclinical trials.1-18 HIV: The Basics 9/03the medicine is not helping or hurting your child. No matter if your child is in a clinical trial or not,good medical care will be given to him/her.
