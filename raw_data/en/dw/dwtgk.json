Your mind, body, and soul can benefit from new cultures in distant lands, and traveling to these unique places has long been a form of spiritual practice. If you're looking to reap the benefits of natural healing, you must be selective about where you go! You can't just travel to any old place; it has to offer something for your body and spirit. From mystical religious sites to therapeutic hot springs, there are plenty of locations all over the world that provide natural healing and spiritual experiences. Below are 20 of the best spiritual destinations from every corner of the globe. Each one provides you with a soul-nourishing experience that is guaranteed to improve your connection with the earth, other people, and, most importantly, yourself. Blue Lagoon - Grindav\u00edk, Iceland The Blue Lagoon is Iceland's most visited attraction when it comes to physical and spiritual wellbeing. The lagoon's geothermal waters are rich in minerals, including salts, silica, and even algae. The nutrient-rich soft white mud rejuvenates your body when applied, leaving you feeling relaxed and refreshed. There's an outdoor spa offering a premium service, where you'll be treated to a comfortable bathrobe, a pair of slippers, and two mud masks. Sit back in the warm water with your mask on and allow nature to do its thing. The mask's exfoliating effect will leave your skin beautiful and radiant, but that's not all that will be glowing; your soul will be feeling the love too. Camino de Santiago - Europe This world-renowned pilgrimage passes through several European countries: France, Portugal, and Spain. The final destination is the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain, where Saint James is rumored to be buried. Originally used exclusively by pilgrims, the routes are now popular with tourists from all over the world. The Camino de Santiago is often dubbed the trip of a lifetime, which isn't surprising, considering it can take up to 35 days to complete when walking 25 kilometers per day. People often make the journey one section at a time, returning at a later date to resume where they left off. The walk certainly tests your mental and physical strength, making it a very unique and rewarding journey to go on. The best time to make the trip is between April and June, or during September and October. Healing Forests - Japan The term \"forest bathing\" is alien to most people, but it's well known in Japan. The ritual of forest bathing involves taking meditative strolls through the woods, where you unwind and relax in the heart of nature. The benefits of forest bathing are backed up by science, with evidence showing it helps boost self-esteem and strengthen the body's immune system. The practice first started in Japan, and the country is now home to 62 forest therapy bases. You can take a guided tour in Japanese and English, or if you'd prefer to, you can do it alone. Medicinal Mayan Gardens - Near San Antonio, Belize Belize is full of natural healing places, from kitchen gardens, hotel resorts, yoga retreats, and a whole lot more. One of the country's best places for healing is Garcia Sisters, the home of many generations of Mayan natural healers. You'll learn how to resolve stomach issues with brewed herbs, treat the flu with soursop leaves, and reduce inflammation with mashed up oregano leaves. You'll find no end of opportunities to practice meditation and spiritual healing here. Table Mountain - Cape Town, South Africa Table Mountain is an iconic sight to behold, towering more than 3,500 feet above the South African city of Cape Town. The mountain contains vast quantities of quartz stone, which is considered to be one of the world's most powerful healing stones. For that reason alone, the site attracts thousands of spiritual travelers from all over the world each year. As you take in the stunning city and ocean views, you'll be mesmerized by the beauty that earth has to offer. If hiking isn't your thing, you can still enjoy the sights by hopping on the cableway that takes you to the top of the mountain. Mount Shasta - Siskiyou County, California For decades, Mount Shasta has been a popular destination for spiritual seekers. It's regarded as an excellent source of natural healing, and according to Native American legend, it's a sacred and powerful place. Some people say Mount Shasta is where heaven meets the earth, which could be true as it stands at over 14,000 feet tall! Healing Springs - Budapest Despite being hidden in plain sight, the healing springs of Budapest are perhaps one of Europe's best-kept secrets. Budapest is home to more than 100 natural hot springs, with three of the biggest spa complexes located right in the heart of the city. The biggest one in the whole of Europe is Sz\u00e9chenyi - we'd definitely recommend paying a visit! After taking a dip in these mineral-rich springs, you'll feel refreshed, energized, and spiritually cleansed. And of course, the architecture is full of history and character, as is typical in Hungary. Dead Sea - Jordan and Israel Did you know that the dead sea isn't a sea at all? It's actually a massive salt lake that sits 1,290 feet below sea level, making it the lowest elevation and lowest body of water on the planet. Located just 30 minutes away from Jerusalem, the dead sea attracts lots of tourists in search of its natural healing powers. The black, mineral-rich mud is used by visitors to nourish their skin, leaving it silky smooth and radiant. Ubud - Bali, Indonesia This list wouldn't be complete without mentioning Bali! Bali has earned the nickname of \"Island of Gods\" due to its many spiritual rituals and traditions that date back thousands of years. There are countless temples and healers dotted all over the island, hidden among the stunning forests and lush vegetation. Ubud is perhaps the island's best known spiritual escape, known for its shamans, yoga, art workshops, and healthy cuisine. If you're in Bali on a spiritual journey, be sure to check out Ubud, you won't be disappointed! Pamukkale Hot Springs - Denizli, Turkey These hot springs look like no other place on earth - in fact, they look like something from another planet! The white, chalky structures are made from rock deposits, and they contain beautiful blue water from the hot springs. The springs are said to cure many ailments, from high blood pressure to arthritis and asthma. One thing's for sure: a dip in these springs will leave you feeling renewed and full of energy. Pack your bathing suit and book yourself a tour of the springs! Le Monast\u00e8re des Augustines - Quebec City, Canada Silence, beauty, and peace.

It has everything you'll need for a relaxing experience, including accommodation, daily activities, healthy food, healing sessions, and a wellbeing center.

That's followed by natural healing activities, such as exploring the monastery, enjoying massages, walking through nature, and practicing meditation. There's no doubt about it, you'll leave this place full of peace and tranquility. Uluru (Ayers Rock) - Northern Territory, Australia Uluru, commonly known as Ayers Rock, receives more than 300,000 tourists every single year. Even so, it doesn't feel like your typical tourist destination. The 550 million-year-old sandstone is sacred to the indigenous Anangu people, and it's believed that being close to the rock provides unique healing benefits. Climbing the rock used to be popular with tourists, but it's now forbidden out of respect for the indigenous people. Kyoto - Japan For more than one thousand years, Kyoto has been the center of Japanese culture, and it still is today. In fact, it was once the capital city of Japan! Kyoto is populated with thousands of spiritual sites and traditional wooden houses. There are over 1,600 Buddhist temples, 400 Shinto shrines, and 90 Christian churches in the city, making it a hub of religion and spirituality. The scenery is simply picture-perfect, with typical Japanese style shrines sitting against the backdrop of stunning mountains and warm blossom trees. A real beauty to behold! Cape Reinga - New Zealand Also known as Te Rerenga Wairau, Cape Reinga is located at the northern tip of New Zealand's north island. It's a sacred place to the Maori people, as they believe the recently deceased use the cape to leave earth and pass on to the afterlife. The awe-inspiring views stretch on for miles, with the cape overlooking where the Pacific and Tasman seas meet. If you do decide to visit this beautiful place, don't consume food on the cape and leave everything as you found it out of respect for the Maori people. Borobudur - Indonesia Borobudur is the biggest Buddhist temple on the planet, located on the Indonesian island of Java. The structure was built in the 9th century, using more than 2 million stone blocks to form a massive mandala - a diagram of the universe in all its perfection. This is a sacred structure in Buddhism, with the center of the structure representing Nirvana. Walking up the steps of the pyramid allows you to really harness the energy of this history-rich and super sacred place. The views are pretty magnificent too. Angkor Wat - Cambodia Constructed in the 12th century, Angkor Wat in Cambodia spans over 402 acres, making it the largest spiritual site in the world. It's regarded as the heart and soul of Cambodia, a real national treasure. It was originally built as a Hindu temple to house the remains of King Suryavarman II, but over time it became a Buddhist temple. It's awe-inspiring to see the stunning feat of construction and the high level of detail that went into building the site. The temple really gives off a great vibe and powerful energy, which is why people travel from all over the world to benefit from the natural healing that Angkor Wat has to offer. Sedona - Arizona Sedona is a desert town, situated about 100 miles south of the Grand Canyon. It was originally a sacred place for Native American tribes, and it's home to many unmarked energy vortexes. However, these days it's extremely popular with people from all walks of life who are seeking wellness and spiritual energy. The town has many wellness centers that offer yoga, meditation, alternative medicine, crystals, card reading, and a whole lot more. Machu Picchu - Peru Created by the Inca Empire in the 15th century, Machu Picchu is a real marvel to behold that's located high up in the Andes Mountains. It's home to many temples, caves, and shrines, but it's best known for its advanced construction. The journey to the top of the mountain is very spiritual and has been undertaken for hundreds of years. Many of Machu Picchu's sites have been used for healing purposes and connecting with ancient energies. Machu Picchu was abandoned at one point in history, and its former use is still shrouded in mystery to this day. Sanctuary of Apollo - Greece Located in Delphi, the Sanctuary of Apollo has a lot of history dating back to 1500 BC. It was once considered as the center of the earth by the ancient Greeks, and it was also home to the famous Oracle, who'd make tough decisions for people. For those seeking advice and energy, this is the place to visit. If you're planning to travel during the summer months, we'd recommend visiting in the early morning or late afternoon as it can be absolutely scorching! The Western Wall - Israel The Western Wall is a very symbolic place for many religions, including Christianity, Islam, and in particular, Judaism. It has a fascinating history, having been originally built by King Herod in 20 CE. The wall was once part of the second temple of Jerusalem, but it was mostly destroyed by the Romans. All that's left is this limestone wall, sometimes called the \"wailing wall\" as a nod to the people mourning the temple's loss. It's a great place to visit, and thousands of religious people make the trip each year as part of a pilgrimage.
