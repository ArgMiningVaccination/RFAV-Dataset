We propose a categorization of these meth ods within a single theory and framework, as this has previously been lacking. To be considered under the rubric of TAIM applied therapies, the procedures must have: 1) proof of use in the Arab and Muslim world; 2) consider ed an essential component of Avicenna's compendium of regimental therapy; and 3) historical lineage acc ording to regional, cultural or Islamic healing practices. We developed a taxonomy of applied therapies by deno ting each as a primary or supportive method and providing a definition for each category of methods. We define applied therapy as techniques or procedures involving physical and manual contact with the individual that are aimed at restoring health and preventing illness. Primary methods describe therapies which when used individually can impact the vital force of the body in order to preserve or restore health, while supportive methods describe t herapies used in conjunction with primary methods intended to augment or create a synergistic and enhanced effect , exceeding that of primary methods alone. Our work provides a fundamental step in continuing the evolution of the TAIM conceptual model and advancing our understanding of the diverse practices under the rubric of appl ied therapy. Researchers can use this comprehensive TAIM taxonomy for investigating the respective elements, and sy stematically exploring the theoretical and therapeutic applications. hijama, hyd rotherapy, unani medicine, Avi cenna 1. Introduction The Traditional Arabic & Islamic Medicine (TAIM) model was intr oduced to define and organize the multiple intertwined elements within a single conceptual framework (Alra wi & Fetters, 2012). TAIM elements include medicinal herbs, dietary practices, mind-body therapy, spiritua l healing and applied therapy. We define applied therapy as techniques or procedures involving physical and manual contact with the individual, aimed at restoring health and preventing illness . Applied therapies are among the most utilized methods of trea tment employed by traditional physicians for preventive and therapeutic measures (Lone et al., 2011). A taxonomy that unifies and demonstrates the depth and encapsul ates the richness of the applied therapies specifically has been lacking. Absence of a systematic categori zation, one that is cohesive and comprehensive, creates a barrier to the classification of applied methods and research investigating the prevalence of use. Thus, the primary objectives in this paper are: 1) to define and categori ze in a taxonomy the applied therapy element of the TAIM model and contextualize its application within the scope o f p r a c t i c e , a n d 2 ) t o s u g g e s t a h i e r a r c h i c a l organization of the methods utilized as primary or supportive. To achieve these objectives, we first review the historical context of applied therapies, and known extent of us e. We then explain our methodology for creating a typology and describe each component of the typology based on k nown origins and current applications. We conclude with a discussion of the typology including potential limitations. 1.1 History of Applied Therapy and Extent of Use Since the third millennium B.C., Arab and Muslim physicians hav e drawn on traditional practices in ancient Mesopotamia and ancient Babylon (De Bustinza, 2016). They have also practiced medicine with roots in gjhs.ccsenet.org Globa l Journal of Health S cience V ol. 11, No. 10; 2019 74 Graeco-Roman, Chinese, Persian and Ayurvedic theories and princ iples. One of the most significant thinkers and writers of the Islamic golden age, Avicenna, believed that \"med icine is the art whereby health is maintained and the art by which it is restored when lost\" (p. 90) (M. A. Khan, Raz a, & I. A. Khan, 2015). Physicians believed in promotion of health, prevention of disease and restoration of h ealth through regimental and dietary therapies (Lone et al., 2012). Avicenna described 36 methods to restore balance of patients' various elements, humors and faculties (Hamid, 2018). Arab and Muslim physicians such as Rhazes and Av icenna believed both physical and spiritual health is essential, that the body should be treated as a whole entity rather than separate parts and organs, and that the body possesses the natural ability to heal when provided wi th rest, a good diet, fresh air, and cleanliness (Saad & Said, 2011). Illness is viewed as an opportunity to serve, cl ean, purify and balance the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual realms (Lone et al., 2012). This core beli ef can be seen weaved through the methods utilized for restoring and maintaining health. Previous research demonstrates widespread use of applied therap i e s g l o b a l l y , ( H a m i d , 2 0 1 8 ) y e t a c l e a r a n d encompassing definition and framework illuminating historical r oots, religious influences and modern day applications is lacking. The clinical implications of defining the scope of applied therapy practices are to shed light on commonly utilized methods, dem onstrate potentia l for integra tion of methods into health care needs, understand determinants of care as well as delineate patterns o f utilization. 2. Methods 2.1 Methodology for Creating the Typology For procedures to be considered under the rubric of TAIM applie d therapies, we required: 1) proof of use in the Arab and Muslim world; 2) considered an essential component of Avicenna's compendium of regimental therapy; and 3) historical lineage accordin g to regional, cultural or Is lamic healing practices. General treatment objectives follow a three-step pattern specifying elimination of cause, no rmalization of humors, and normalization of tissues and or organs. We created a typology of primary and supportive methods to differentiate between the various therapies in their approach to modulate the patient's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health with the goal of restoring constitutional balance. We arrived at this categorization of primary and supportive met hods based on careful examination of historical and current use, as well as p hysiological effect of each applied therapy. Figure 1 illustrates primary an d supportive methods o f the applied thera py element within TAIM. 2.1.1 Primary Methods Primary methods describe therapies which when used individually can impact the vital force of the body in order to preserve or restore health and achieve the goals of recovery. T hese methods are often considered part of a standard set of treatments. Primary methods include leeching, venesectio n, cupping, manual therapy, cauterization, auricular therapy, fomentation, hydrotherapy, and physical move ment. We grouped the aforementioned procedures under primary methods based on evidence of use in chronic and l ifestyle mediated conditions including asthma, coronary heart disease, type 2 di abetes, digestive disorders, m usculoskeletal concerns, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic skin disorders as well as autoimmune conditions. By vir tue of their effect, procedures listed under primary methods are able to balance the elements inherent in every indi vidual by manipulating innate or acquired, physical or energetic, deficiencies involving body, mind, and spirit. If primary methods are unable to produce a cure or cause unwarranted effects, supportive methods are employed. 2.1.2 Supportive Methods Supportive methods describe therapies used in conjunction with primary methods and are intended to augment or create a synergistic and enhanced effect, which exceeds that of a primary method alone. As illustrated in Figure 1, examples include, purgation, emesis, diuresis, enema, diaphores is, irrigation, expectoratio n, and counter irritation. Supportive measures are designed to further aid cleansing, bala ncing, healing, and rejuvenation if and when primary methods alone are unable to encourage the goals of reco very (Figure 1). We chose the term supportive rather than secondary to highlight the interconnectivity (as re presented by the arrows in Figure 1) and sometimes promoting nature of these methods. We turn now to the role of p rimary methods and expound upon the understanding of the applied therapy element of the TAIM model. gjhs.ccsenet.org Globa l Journal of Health S cience V ol. 11, No. 10; 2019 75 Figure 1. Hierarchical categor ization of TAIM applied therapy 2.2 Description of the Applied Therapy Typology Componenets Initial approaches to treatment entail the establishment of a r egimen of care, or applied therapy, to correct and balance factors contributing to ill health. Should this initial course of treatment prove to be ineffective, only then are additional methods such as diet and natural medicine recomm ended. The safety and efficacy of applied therapies have been supported by scientific rigor, however addi tional studies are needed to standardize and develop parameters for evaluation of the efficacy of all proced ures. Important techniques i n applied therapy along with details regarding its principles, objectives, indications, clinical applications, and contraindications are described below. 2.2.1 Leeching The Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Greeks, Mayans, and Aztecs practi ced leech therapy (Lone et al., 2011). When Islamic medical theories began to disseminate through the Latin speaking countries of Europe, leech therapy became more widespread (Lone et al., 2011). Leech therapy, or Taleeq , relies on the application of medicinal leeches ( Hirudo medicinalis ) to an affected area to suck and draw the blood from deeper ti ssues (Ahmad & Anwar, 2009). Avicenna described the m ethodlogy of leech therapy accor ding to pre-leeching, proper leeching and post leeching procedures (Lone et al., 2011). During this process, l eeches infuse their saliva into the blood, providing a complex mixture of biologically and pharmacologically active su bstances (Singh, 2010). Abdualkader, Ghawi, Alaama, Awang and Merzouk (2013) indicate that the important ad vantage of leech therapy is that it may be advised on those areas of the body where other processes of blo odletting like venesection and cupping are not possible. Clinical applications. Jha, Garg, Narang and Das (2015) indicate the use of leech the rapy in varicose veins, chronic skin disease, chronic ul cers, migraines, musculoskeleta l and cardiovascular conditions. Contraindications r e p o r t e d b y P a r m a r a n d P a r m a r ( 2 0 1 4 ) i n c l u d e t h e t r e a t m e n t o f m edical conditions and diseases including hemorrhagic diseases, absolute hemophilia, pregnancy, anemia, h ypotension, general fatigue, allergy to leech, active tuberculosis, immune compromised and severely ill, bed r idden and extremely fearful patients. Parmar and Parmar (2014) further suggest sites of the body where leech app lication is contraindicated such as the abdomen around the liver, spleen, stomach and intestine, and report the risk of adverse effects and complications such as pain during treatment, local itching, hypotension, vasovagal at tacks, anemia, infections, allergies, sepsis, scarring, and slight fever. 2.2.2 Venesection Venesection, or Fad, originated in the ancient civilization of Egypt, then continue d with the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Asians, and eventually spread through Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (Greenstone, 2010). In this procedure, an incision is made in any of the 32 superficial vessels, and blood containing waste material is allowed to flow (Sherwani, A. N. Anasari, H. A. Ana sari, & I. A. J. A. Anasari, 2004). Historically, instruments used included thorns, sharp sticks, and pieces of s hell (Bergum & Ansari, 2012). Bloodletting is generally carried out from various veins and arteries; each pro viding a site for specific indications, i.e. cephalic vein used for diseases of the head and neck like meningitis, co njunctivitis and pain in the ear (Bergum & Ansari, 2012). The practice of venesection was not recommended by the P rophet Muhammad which explains why general bloodletting was not a practice early Muslims implemented follo wing the Prophet's death in 632 AD despite their awareness of it (El-Wakil, 2011). Bergum and Ansari (2012) cons idered spring as a suitabl e time for venesection. Clinical applications. Faiz and Ali (2018) indicate the use of venesection for removin g excess or abnormal humors, gjhs.ccsenet.org Globa l Journal of Health S cience V ol. 11, No. 10; 2019 76 preventing accumulation of waste material in the blood, excreti ng waste material from various parts of the body, stimulating metabolic processes and correcting altered temperam ents. Contraindications reported by Khan, Siddiqui, Itrat and Jamal (2014) include applying procedure in excessively cold temperament and climate, in cases of severe pain, after coitus, in children less than fourteen ye ars of age, obesity, in elderly persons, with a full stomach, after resolving baths, and during pregnancy or menstru ation. 2.2.3 Cauterization Cauterization and the use of heat therapy were known to various ancient cultures including Egyptian, Indian, Chinese, Greco-Roman as well as pre- and post-Islamic and Arab culture (Alsanad, Asim, Gazzaffi, & Qureshi, 2018). The use of cautery, or Kai, was greatly developed by the Arab Muslim physician Albucassis , who described various techniques, instruments, indications, precautionary mea sures, and related possible risks to more than 50 cauteries (Alsanad et al., 2018). The number of cautery events in one session vary, and the place of application is specific to each disease. Treatment further depends on the age and sex of the patient (Farid & El-Mansoury, 2015). The instrument used for cauterization is called cautery or Mikwt, and preferably made of gold or iron (Nasir, Fatma, Ali, & Ahmad, 2018). In a prophetic tradition, it is nar rated that the Prophet Muhammad performed cautery on one of his companions when he had sepsis on his finger, (Nik hat & Fazil, 2013) and on another occasion to stop bleeding. However, it is believed that the Prophet allowed the use of cauterization only i n severe cases, which has since been maintained according to Islamic law (El-Wakil, 2011) . The Prophet advised against the use of cauterization as a routine procedure, and it's apparent that th e practice of cupping was favored to cauterization following his teachings (El-Wakil, 2011). Clinical applications. Nikhat and Fazil (2013) report the use of cauterization in five circ umstances: \"first to halt the spread of sepsis; second, to stop the flow of disease-causi ng humors toward the health y areas; third, to correct the abnormal cold temperament in an organ; fourth, to stop hemo rrhage, and fifth to remove dead and necrotic tissue when other methods are not effective\" (p. 83). Indicatio ns for cauterization also include paralysis, recurrent cold and cough, migraine, musculoskeletal disorders, vascular b leeding, gangrene, splenomegaly, and ascites. Cauterization is contraindicated in extremely cold or hot weat her (Nasir, Fatma, Ali & Ahmad, 2018). Following the pro cedure, patients are treated wit h herbal medicine and prescribed a specific diet to aid recovery. 2.2.4 Cupping The earliest recorded references to cupping therapy are found i n the Ebers Papyrus, dating back to 1550 B.C (Qureshi et al., 2017). Cupping therapy has roots among many an cient healing systems including Chinese, Unani, traditional Korean, Tibetan, Afri can, European, Ar abic and Prop hetic medicine, with variations in the types of cups used, methods of cupping, and application sites (Mehta & D hapte, 2015). Cupping in Arabic is called Hijama , and derived from the Arabic word ' ajm, which means to suck something out, to collect, or to extract so as to restore something to its natural state (Qureshi et al., 2017). It is a technique in which a cup is applied over the surface of the skin by creating a vacuum--this is known as dry cupping or ijmat bil Shart (Mehta & Dhapte, 2015). Dry cupping can further be subdivided into two types: fi re cupping and cupping without fire (Mohammad, Fasihuzzaman, & Jabeen, 2015). Sometimes, scarification is done at the location of cupping to draw blood, this process is known as wet cupping or ijmat bil-Shart (Mehta & Dhapte, 2015). Wet cupping can further be subdivided into mandatory and optional, depending on the indica tion. According to Islamic tradition, hijama is usually explicit to 'blood cupping' (El-Wakil, 2011). Hijama wa s recommended by the prophet Muhammad, who mentioned cupping in approximately 28 holy instructions or hadith (Saqlain, Ali, & Parveen, 2017). According to the teachings of the prophet, hijama is recommended on the 17th , 19th and 21st of the month, according to the Islamic lunar calendar (Saqlain, Ali, & Parveen, 2017). Various sites of the body are indicated for application of hijama (Mohammad, Fasihuzzaman, & Jabeen, 2015). To date, this method of healing continues to thrive in many Muslim countries (Deuraseh, 2006). Clinical applications. Ahmedi and Siddiqui (2014) report indications for cupping such as the elimination or diversion of morbid material, enhancing circulation, correcting the temperament of a particular organ and promoting detoxification. Qureshi et al., (2017) reports indica tion of cupping therapy for the treatment of many chronic conditions including but not limited to musculoskeletal diseases, cardiovascular disorders, skin diseases, inflammatory disorders, neuropsyc hiatric and metabolic disorder Sadeghfard and Zarshenas (2014) inc lude anemia, pregnancy, extreme cold weather, obesity or frail constitution, child ren less than 2 years of ag e or adults over 60, before or after coitus. gjhs.ccsenet.org Globa l Journal of Health S cience V ol. 11, No. 10; 2019 77 2.2.5 Manual Therapy. Manual Therapy Includes Therapeutic Massa ge, Reflexology and Bone Setting 2.2.5.1 Therapeutic Massage T h e r a p e u t i c m a s s a g e , a l s o k n o w n a s dalk, is the manipulation of muscle and connective tissue using var ious techniques, to enhance organ function and body mechanics, promo te relaxation and well-being thereby enabling the healing process. The mechanis m of action is based on the ev acuation or diversion of morbid humors and excess fluids from the body, thus maintaining homeostasis in the quali ty and quantity of four bodily humors responsible for the maintenance of health; black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood (Ahmed et al., 2014). Traditional Arab medicine identifies several varieties of therapeutic massage in cluding strong pressure or friction ( dalak e sulb pressure or friction pressure dalak e khashin) ; each achieving a certain effect in the body. For instance, soft pressure massage ( dalak e layyin ) is considered relaxing in nature, while moderate massage ( dalak moatadil ) improves and maintains blood circulation. Two additional type s of massage incorporate using a cloth to facilitate application. The first type, rough ( dalak e khashin ) uses a rough textured cloth to improve blood circulation and facilitate nutritive energy to the muscles and organs. A second type, smooth ( dalak e amlas ), uses cloths like silk to improve peripheral blood circulation and pr ovide nutrition to adjacent tissue. Clinical applications. Jamal et al. (2013) reports general indications of massage incl uding musculoskeletal and chronic pain, weight management, immune system support, reducin g inflammation and ameliorating psychosomatic disorders. Therapeutic massage can be combined wi th aromatic oils and varies in its application based on temperament of organ and person, disease as well as co ndition of patient, season and desired outcome (Jafar, Ansari, Alam, Khalid, & Mand, 2015). Rough massage has been identified as a treatment for alopecia, while smooth massage is indicated for conditions such as fatigue (Jam al et al., 2013). Though generally a safe procedure, Khalique and Siddiqui (2017) report contraindications for massa ge in inflammatory conditions, bleeding disorders, skin wounds and ulcers as well as severe osteoporosis, they als o suggest that therapeutic massage should not be performed in any area of the body with a blood clot, fracture, open or healing wound and skin infections. 2.2.5.2 Reflexology Egyptian hieroglyphics depict the ancient beginnings of reflexo logy (Cade, 2002). Evidence of reflexology is found on a wall painting in the tomb of Ankhmahor, illustrating a physician massaging the hands and feet of a patient (Callaway & Burgess, 2009). Techniques used in the form of massage included thumb and finger pressure, as well as squeezing and pressing with the fingertips. Today su ch techniques may be referred to as reflexology (Embong, Soh, Ming, & Wong, 2015). Reflexology, or Tadlik Alqadam , is based on the notion that there are reflex areas on the hands, feet and ear auricles that correspond to sp ecific parts of the body (Oleson & Flocco, 1993). Pressure applied to these specific areas assist in potentiating the normal functioning of the corresponding body part and thus can be used to restore and maintain the body's natural equilibrium and encourage healing (Asltoghiria & Ghodsib, 2012). Clinical applications. Khuda and Al-Shamrani (2018) report the integration of foot the rapy in prescriptions for sub-acute or chronic strokes noted by Avicenna who recommended massaging the feet in warm salty water and hot oils. Referenced oils include lily flower, dill seed and chamom ile flower (Zargaran, Zarshenas, Karimi, Yarmohammadi, & Borhani-Haghighi, 2013). Other recommendations include support after a headache or migraine attack by applying several hours of foot massage with violet essential oil, salt, chamomile oil and clove gillyflower (Gorji & Ghadiri, 2002). Foot therapy is recommende d for the treatment of insomnia as well as anointing the forehead or feet (Feyzabadi, Javan, Mokaberinejad , & Aliasl, 2014). To com bat sexual dysfunction, massage to the soles of the foot with almond oil before sexual intercourse is recommended daily for a duration of five minutes (Molkara et al., 2018). Contraindications include foot infections or wounds, some circulatory and cardiac problems, recent surgery an d high-risk pregnancies (Hor owitz, 2004). 2.2.5.3 Bone Setting The Ebers papyrus, one of the oldest and most comprehensive pre served medical documents in ancient Egypt, contains writings on bone setting (Serageldin, 2013). A notable surgeon of Arab medicine, Albucasis, compiled writings on cautery and bloodletting as well as bone setting (A njum, 2013). Bone setting or Al Tajbeer , identifies procedures related to dislocated and fractured bones. In either of these forms of treatment, herbal remedies and dietary practices are utilized as an adjunct to treatment. In A frican countries, the role of bone setters in correcting fractures and dislocations is pivotal to many communities. Bone setting is a technique commonly recognized in Traditional Chinese Medicine for the treatment of fractured or dislocated bones by means of various manipulative therapies in conjunction with herbs (Robinson, 2006). While som e value and prefer traditional bone setting to its gjhs.ccsenet.org Globa l Journal of Health S cience V ol. 11, No. 10; 2019 78 western counter part, evidence indicates it has become less pro minent in the Middle East as access to modern hospitals and private clinics is i ncreasingly available (Ghazan far, 2011). Clinical applications. Manipulation techniques are intended to realign the musculoskel etal and ligamentous relationships. Use of this procedure is indicated for fractures or joint manipulation of limbs and lower jaw as well as spine, pelvis and shoulder, b ed rest is recommended for the latter. Prescriptions noted include a mixture of egg yolk and certain local herbs molded into a plaster and applied to fractured, dislocated or displaced bones (Hurreiz, 2002). As demonstrated by Ghazan far (2011), \"once a bone fractu re is corrected, a plaster is applied made from the resin of Acacia spp., seeds of tamarind or lentils mixed with e gg. The fracture is then bound with cloth and the limb stabilized with wooden planks\" (p. 3). Certain plants are also used in instances when the bone setter may have to break and reset the bone if it is not set properly. To aid reco very, a diet of date or bee honey is also prescribed. Other prescriptions include the preparation of poultice using black d ate and ground sheep fat to assist skeletal pain and dislocations (Asefzadeh & Sameef ar, 2001). To aid swollen joint s, preparations of boiled mellow leaf mixed with egg yolk and salt are used. Complications of bone setting inclu de mal-union and non-union of fractures, compartment syndrome, tetanus, deformities, chronic osteomyelit is and soft tissue infections, gangrene and amputation (Manjunath, 2016). Contraindications of bone setting are comparable to those of other manual therapies including but not limited to inflammatory processes a nd severe forms of osteoporosis. 2.2.6 Auricular Therapy Auricular therapy is a treatment modality in which specific poi nts are stimulated on th e ear with the goal of correcting the body's dysfunction (Round, Litscher, & Bahr, 201 3). A postulated relationship between external body points and various effects on the body, is a part of the m edical historical record of a number of ancient societies. In the 16th a nd 18th centuries, rudimentary knowledge of ear acupuncture and auricu lar therapy was found in Arab folk medicine (Landgren, 2008). Medieval Arabic m edicine also describes a correlation between internal organs and at least one external point on the body (Ra mey, 2000). The practice of cauterizing a part of the ear with a hot metal probe has been reported among certain trib es in Arabia, \"likely a vestige of the acupuncture practiced in ancient Egypt and Sa udi Arabia\" (Gori & Firenzuoli , 2007). The Ebers papyrus of 1550 B.C. describes a system of channels and vessels in the body; which closely res embles the Chinese system of meridians (Gori & Firenzuoli, 2007). Clinical applications. Hippocrates described the method of auricular therapy for the t reatment of impotence and observed that women were less likely to conceive if points on t he ear were stimulated (Gori & Firenzuoli, 2007). Egyptologist Alexandre Varille, documented that women in ancien t Egypt had their external ear cauterized with heat or pricked with a needle as a form of contraception. Clini cal and basic research suggests auriculotherapy can be effective in the treatment of pain, and for anxiety related disorders (Gori & Firenzuoli, 2007). Gori and Firenzuoli (2007) report the cauterization of the external ear for treatments of sciatic pain and sexual dysfunction. Contraindications for auricular therapy include pregnancy, thos e who are immune compromised and in severe bleeding disorders (Tan, Molassiotis, Wang, & Suen, 2014). 2.2.7 Fomentation Fomentation, or Takmeed, has been used by many ancient medical traditions (Sinclaire, 2 007). Fomentation is the soothing application of warm substances to the body, expediting the delivery of heat or moisture to the body for purposes of healing. A poultice or compress is often used, and when herbs are necessary, they are applied to the skin through a cloth soaked in an infusion or decoction of herb s. Traditionally, wool and cotton material are commonly used for their ability to retain heat and moisture wel l. There are several types of fomentation, including hot, dry, wet, cold, herbal and whole body fomentation (Hamid, 2018). For instance, hot fomentation is whereby a towel is dipped in hot water or a towel is made hot by steam ap plication, whereas wet fomentation relies on the use of a towel dipped in water boiled with analgesic or anti-inflam matory herbs (Hamid, 2018). Application of fomentation varies acco rding to the areas o f the body being tre ated. Clinical applications. Fomentation enhances circulation, thereby increasing eliminatio n of wastes and toxins from the body and relievin g internal congestion. Indications of fomentation include local swelling and pain, sinusitis, bloating, nervous tension, sleeplessness, menstrual pain, colic , constipation, cough, congestion, as analgesic, and muscle relaxant. Hot dry fomentation is beneficial for flatulen ce whereas hot moist fomentation is beneficial for arthritis (Baig, Quamri, Khan, A nzarAlam, Maaz, & Ahmed, 2014). Bitschai (1952) provides examples of prescriptions for the use of pomegranate flowers, celery and coriander. Manik, Wahid, Islam, Pal and Ahmed (2013) provide indications f or fomentation of warmed wheat bran, salt and/or dill leaves applied to the stomach for the treatment of bloating (Larijani et al., 2016). Tumpa, Hossain and gjhs.ccsenet.org Globa l Journal of Health S cience V ol. 11, No. 10; 2019 79 Ishika (2014) indicate the use of boiled leaves of Indian ash t ree applied as a fomentation for the treatment of local swelling and pain (Manik et al., 2013). Sultana, Lamatunoor, Be gum and Qhuddsia (2017) indicate use of the root of velvet bean boiled in water, and a sterile cloth soaked in t he warm solution and applied for conditions related to pain in the vagina or enlargement of vaginal tissue due to part urition (Tumpa, Hossain, & Ishika, 2014). Unani scholars have prescribed hot fomentation with warm water or wit h decoction of various herbs such as common wormwood, orris root or leaves of cherry to relieve uterine pai n (Sultana et al., 2017). Contraindications include loss of sensation caused by spinal cord injury, diabetic neurop athy, rash or other skin conditions that could be made worse by heat, inflammation, swelling, open wounds including bu rn, sore or cracked skin from eczema or severe chapping and malignancy (Sinclaire, 2007). 2.2.8 Hydrotherapy. Hydrotherapy Includes the Medicinal Bath or ammm, Sitz bath, Hand & Foot Bath, Vaporization, Steam & Aromatherapy The use of water for therapeutic purposes is found amongst many traditions. The Rig Veda, a religious text of ancient India, as well as prescriptions found in biblical recor ds, describe hydrotherapy tr eatments used for healing (Wardle, 2013). Use of 'gush of water is mentioned in medical treatise based on writings of Hippocrates, Galen, Celsus as well as Avicenna and Rhazes. The pouring of water, al one or in combination with other prescriptions, was applicable in a variety of illnesses such as fever, joint p ain, psychic disease and he adache but also considered a general therapeutic method (Jacoby, 2002). Hippocrates descri bed hydrotherapy in his writings noting that \"for the bath soothes the pain in the side, chest and back; cuts the sputum, promotes expectoration, improves the respiration, and allays lassitude: for it soothes the joints an d outer skin, and is diuretic, removes the heaviness of the head, and moistens the nose\" (p.12) (Wardle, 2013). Further more, along with lifestyle modifications, Hippocrates viewed the applicati on of water for healing as an e ssential component of his regimen (Wardle, 2013). 2.2.8.1 ammm Hammam, or traditional bath house, was an essential fabric of I slamic society. Following the rise of Islam, rapid development in the architecture of hammm was observed (Sibley & Jackson, 2012). Centrally located near mosques, souks and residential areas, a hammm provided a venue for the completion of ablutions necessary before praying but also served as a platform for social interac tion and rituals (Sibley, 2008). A traditional hammam consists of three consecutive rooms with one room leading to th e other furnishing specific provisions and conditions; the cold (frigidarium), the warm (tepidarium), and the hot (calidarium) (Raftani & Radoine, 2008). Avicenna compared each chamber to a season; the bather passing through each chamber within a specified duration of time, so he is amenab le and adaptable to the change s of every season (Sherwani, Ahmed, Naaz, Khan Sherwani, & Khan, 2006). The ham mam ritual did not involve a ma ssage, however it began to be performed later on (\u00d6zk\u00f6se, 2005). Kolb and Dumr eicher (2008) completed a case study of hammm traditions in five different countries around the Mediterranean, and concluded that a vivid social life, specific washing ceremonies and festive rituals continue to be practiced. Clinical applications. Several types of baths have been described, including medicinal bath, sea bath, thermal bath and oil bath to name a few (Nasir et al., 2018). Avicenna descr ibes the positive effects of the hammm, particularly observing the effect of bathing on promoting circulation, reduc ing viscosity of the humors, enhancing metabolism and overall health, aiding detoxification, regulating weight an d strengthening vitality. He also appreciated the bath for its powerful, purifying and cleansing effect both in a phys ical and spiritual sense. A ccording to Al-Ghazali, a prominent philosopher and mystic (11th century), a bath facilit ates opening of the pores, extraction of superfluous humors, dissolves flatulence and enables urine flow (De Bustinz a, 2016). Use of a hammm is contraindicated on an empty stomach, during pregnancy, fever and asthenia and shou ld not be recommended for prolonged stay (Hamid, 2018). 2.2.8.2 Sitz Bath A sitz bath, or Abzan , is an immersion bath in which an individual will sit in a tub with water covering the hips, buttocks and lower abdomen (Wardle, 2013). This regimen activat es the organs of the abdomen and pelvis by increasing circulation and thereby reducing muscle congestion a nd inflammation (Baig et al., 2014; Nayab, 2016). Evidence exists that Avicenna indicated the use of sitz bath in various diseases, and also used the bath as a means to deliver local application of herbal medicines (Madinah, 2009). There are four types of a sitz bath; hot, cold, neutral and alternating between hot and cold (Hamid, 2018). Clinical applications . Examples of herbs used in conjunction with the bath include o live oil, yarrow and milk (Baig et al., 2014; Nayab, 2016). Other decoctions used in a si tz bath include preparations of chamomile, yellow sweet clover, celery, leaves of common marshmallow and maidenha ir fern (Hussain, Ahmed, Jahan, & Abida, gjhs.ccsenet.org Globa l Journal of Health S cience V ol. 11, No. 10; 2019 80 2016). Prescriptions for the treatment of dysmenorrhea include the use of common juniper, rue, chamomile, sweet marjoram, wild mint and celery (Sultana et al., 2017). Rhazes, a Persian physician, philosopher and alchemist, advised using a sitz bath with a solution using the skin of pom egranate to treat anal pain (Al-Humadi & Al-Samarrai, 2009). A sitz bath with warm water and flax was al so indicated for the treatment of psoriasis (M. S. Khan, Lari, & Khan, 2018). Sitz baths are contraindicated in op en wounds or active bleeding including vaginal bleeding, prolapsed organs, acute inflammation, painful conditi ons with spasm or colic, pregnancy and cardiovascular concerns (Wardle, 2013). 2.2.8.3 Hand & Foot Bath During hand and foot bath therapy, a small tub containing water is utilized, hands or feet are placed into the tub ensuring water covers the forear ms or calf muscle. Rhazes presc ribed foot baths, or Hammam Alqadam , for the treatment of gout and observed that the temperature of water an d the time of application were essential factors involved in gout management (Changizi Ashtiyani, Golestanpour, Shamsi, Tabatabaei, & Ramazani, 2012). An underlying mechanism responsible for the efficacy of foot baths is due to reducing the sympathetic nervous system and affecting autonomic nervous activity (Yamamoto, Aso, Nagata , Kasugai, & Maeda, 2008). Clinical applications. Saeki, Y, N Nagai and M Hishinuma (2007) have demonstrated sign ificant effects of hand and foot baths in relieving stress, combating fatigue and insom nia symptoms in addition to increasing overall body temperature and white blood cell activity, yielding immune boos ting effects and increasing general health and well-being (Saeki, Nagai & Hishinuma, 2007). Oils, herbal extra cts or decoctions are used in conjunction with the bath. Prescriptions can be found for using mustard and warm wat er for the treatment of dysmenorrhea (Rehman, Begum, Anjum, & Tabasum, 2013). For the treatment of dry feet, a warm foot bath is recommended followed by rubbing the feet with oil or fat including the fat of goat and cattle as well as castor, olive and sesame oil (Jedkareh, Esmaeili, Alembagheri, & Mortazav i, 2016). Contraindications fo r a warm hand or foot bath include skin rash and open wounds, however if a bath is prepared hot then contraindic ations would include loss of sensation in hands or feet, diabetes and lymphedema of upper or lower extremities (Si nclaire, 2007). 2.2.8.4 Vaporization, Steam & Aromatherapy. Inhalation therapy was developed during the Islamic ages, Musli m doctors employed it as part of their treatments due to ease of preparation and use (Khashan, 2018). Avicenna in troduced the process of extracting essential oils by means of steam distillation (Saffari & Pakpour, 2012). Albucasi s believed aromatherapy was greatly beneficial and developed the medicine of aromatherapy and its applications (Al raghran & Khatib, 2016). Steam & vaporization therapy, or Bukhoor , involves the inhalation of water vapor from a bowl of boiling water, with the back of the head covered with a towel to prevent evaporation. This method of tre atment is generally applied for 5-10 minutes, and an essential oil, menthol or incense may be added to the boilin g water (Saad & Said, 2011). This method is still routinely applied in the Arab and Islamic world. Clinical applications. Vaporization is indicated for c olds, headaches, acne, cough and as an air freshener. Common oils used during vaporization include amber, chamomile, saffron , sandalwood, violet, camphor, mustard, and musk. Traditional prescriptions of inhalation include raw amber disso lved in chamomile or quince oil, mixed with a small amount of saffron to treat conjunctivitis. Equal parts of sweet almond oil, viola oil, and women's milk dissolved in a small amount of saffron are used to treat weakness of the opt ic nerve (Khashan, 2018). These preparations are placed on the hand and patients are advised to inhale the mixtu re. An alternate preparation for vaporization includes immersing a thin piece of wet cloth in a preparation o f sandalwood and musk dissolved in rose water, patients are advised to vaporize it by the rods of cardamom (Ja lkhi & Kakhshan, 2015). Lavender was known to Unani physicians and was recognized for its beneficial treatmen t of melancholy, mania, epilepsy, amnesia, anxiety, and numbness as it is efficacious for removing morbid matters f rom the brain and clarifying intellect as well as providing strength to other organs including the liver, spleen, stomach and intestines (Khan et al., 2015). Preparation of the leaves of chrysanthemum are used in a steam bath for its sedative and antispasmodic effects, often used to relieve muscle aches, nervousness, and contractio ns of the uterus (Abu-Rabia, 2012). Steam inhalation is contraindicated for inflammatory skin conditions, and injuries to the respiratory tract including burns have been reported as an adverse effect of application (Balakri shnan, Tijunelis, Gordon, & Prasad, 1996). 2.2.9 Physical Movement. Physical Movement Comprises Exercise a nd Ritual Prayer 2.2.9.1 Exercise Noted as an important component of ancient medical theory, phys icians emphasized the centrality of exercise and diet as key components of one's way of life (Berryman, 2012). A long with food and sleep, Avicenna indicated exercise, or riyazat , as the third principle in the preservation of good health (Ba khtiar, Gruner, Shah, & Crook, gjhs.ccsenet.org Globa l Journal of Health S cience V ol. 11, No. 10; 2019 81 2014). He proposed that exercise has a protective effect on hea lth by preventing temperament and humoral disorders, a notion supported by Hippocrates and Galen (Cetkin, Bahsi, & Orhan, 2016). In addition to the proper duration of exercise and the best time to commence physical act ivity, Avicenna expressed that there is an exercise type for each person, and for various parts of the body. Additi onal principles of exercise include age and temperament of a person, present environment and condition of t he body (Firdaus & Sultana). For instance, with vociferation from high-pitched and deep voice, chest and respir atory organs can be made to exercise. The notion of healing sounds is a similar practice to the six healing sounds found in Qigong (Liu, Schaffer, Herrs, Chollet, & Taylor, 2015). Clinical applications. To maintain health and a strong physical constitution, the body requires exercise as well as rest. Arab and Muslim physicians prescribed moderate exercise t o strengthen the organs, increase the vital force of the body, eliminate waste products and increase appetite (Saad & Said, 2011). Islamic medieval texts reveal doctors paid close attention to the patient's regimen; especial ly exercise, a restful environment, and sleep and believed these factors in addition to the patients' temperament , age, and present environment should be adjusted as needed, to ensure the patient's daily life is conducive to reco very (Dols, 1987). Exercise is contraindicated on either a full or empty stomach as well as in the presence of ex cess temperaments in the body, namely hot, dry or cold (Firdaus & Sultana). 2.2.9.2 Ritual Prayer Islamic ritual prayer, or salat , consists of a set of physical postures, or intentional moveme nts including standing, bowing, prostrating and sitting, performed a minimum of five ti mes per day (Doufesh, Ibrahim, & Safari, 2016). Considered to be a mild to moderate form of physical activity, salat provides psychological, musculoskeletal and neurophysiological effects (Ibra him, Sian, Shanggar, & Razack, 2013). This ritual praye r can be compared to tai chi and yoga as it involves the movement of the whole body as w ell as providing those practicing a meditative platform (Doufesh et al., 2016). It has been observed, that dur ing this ritual prayer most of the joints and muscles of the body are engaged with little effort, potentially playing an integral role not only in cerebral blood flow but also postural reflexes (Reza, U rakami, & Mano, 2002). Clinical applications. Considered a type of meditation, prayer may convey many of the psychological and biological benefits associated with improved health including r eduction in blood pressure and heart rate, altering levels of serotonin and melatonin, boosting the immune response , reducing stress and promoting positive mood states including reduction of anxiety, pain, and enhancing self -esteem as well as promoting a favorable influence on overall quality of life (Andrade & Radhakrishnan, 2009). Spi ritual meditation has been found to impart a stronger effect on anxiety, spiritual experiences, and toleranc e to pain when compared to secular meditation. Islamic ritual prayer as well as voluntary and congregational p rayers, unique in their form and spirit, are believed to embody spiritual, psychological, physical and moral benefits (Syed, 2003). Many employ this simple, sacred and spiritual lifestyle to enhance health, happiness and longev ity of the individual and community. There are no contraindications for the performance of salat. 3. Discussion Applied therapy has long played a significant role in providing health promotive, preventive and curative care. Based on this research, we have demonstrated a clear and concis e definition as well as a logical and systematic categorization of the applied ther apy element. This work provid es a definition of applied therapy along with its components, and typology of primary and supportive methods, as a fundamental step in continuing the evolution of the TAIM conceptual model and advancing our understanding of t h e d i v e r s e p r a c t i c e s u n d e r t h e r u b r i c o f applied therapy. While creating a typology is an integral step in providing a hi erarchal categorization, it presents several limitations. First, in theory, it is possible that a method can be both prim ary and supportive. For instance, if two primary therapies are applied in consecutive order to systematically ad dress an imbalance, one could stipulate that the second method albeit still primary by definition, acts as suppo rtive. Second, if a primary method utilized induces a state whereby the resulting effect is similar to a supportive m ethod then it becomes difficult to delineate whether the efficacy is attributed to th e initial or combined effect. T his can be illustrated in the following example whereby a primary method such as hydrotherapy induces diaphoresis, a su pportive method. In either case of the proposed limitations, our typology becomes relevant as we convey an inte rconnectivity among the methods and therefore a space where a synergistic relationship is possible. Lastly, whi le we attempt to highlight the most commonly utilized methods in accordance w ith modern use, historical acco unt and Avicenna's compendium of regimental therapies, there may be additional and less obvious methods req uiring further study. gjhs.ccsenet.org Globa l Journal of Health S cience V ol. 11, No. 10; 2019 82 This typology opens a plethora of research opportunities about applied therapies. What are clinical patterns of utilization, and how do they vary geographically? What are soci oeconomic factors associated with use? How does a user's cultural and religious view impact acceptability of th e different types of therapy? To what extent do practitioners use the different types of applied therapy, and a re the different types of therapy used together? Are there instances where practitioners avoid using a combination o f therapeutic approache s ? I n w h a t w a y s a r e authentic prescriptions being preserved and disseminated? How a re the varied therapies integrated into medical care? 4. Conclusion By delving comprehensively into the components of the TAIM conc eptual model, we have set out to define & categorize the applied therapy el ement, to present the proposed therapies in a cohesive and schematic context and to suggest a hierarchical prese ntation of the methods utilized. While health practitioners and patients continue to apply these methods as they endeavor to improve their health ca re coverage, a deeper understanding of traditional and indigenous health practices must be an evolving process. Re searchers can begin to use this comprehensive TAIM taxonomy to continue examining the respective elements, an d systematically explore the theoretical and therapeutic applications.
