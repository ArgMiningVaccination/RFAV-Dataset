Like any life process that involves change, it can be accompanied by intense discomfort. Menopause symptoms affect women in middle age physically, emotionally, and mentally. TCM and acupuncture treatment are ideally suited to bring balance and allow women to navigate this time with greater ease and menopause symptom relief. Several studies have shown that the three most commonly prescribed forms of Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) or Hormone Replacement all i [ncrease the risk](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/103/4/296/896054) of breast cancer, and the risks increase the longer these therapies are used. [Acupuncture and TCM treat menopausal hot flashes](https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/2008/15060/A_randomized,_controlled_pilot_study_of.12.aspx) effectively without any side effects. Signs of Menopause Symptoms: Hot Flashes, Night Sweats and More Menopause is technically defined as when a woman has not had a period for a full twelve months. The period of time during which a woman begins [experiencing ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hyperthyroidism-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hyperthyroidism-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) related to menopause is actually the pre-menopausal or \"perimenopausal\" state. This phase can unfold over the course of a few months or up to several years; the average amount of time is about four years. Most women begin experiencing perimenopause in their 40s, although some women begin feeling different and having irregular periods as early as their 30s, and other women don't feel changes until their 50s. Perimenopausal symptoms and signs can include: - Irregular menstrual periods - Hot flashes, hot flushes, night sweats - Difficulty sleeping, [sleep apnea, snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Vaginal dryness - Low libido [Urinary incontinence](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Loss of bone density - Higher cholesterol and lower \"good\" cholesterol [Anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), irritability, [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [PMS or PMDD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Headaches - Weight gain About 80% of women will experience hot flashes at some point during their perimenopausal phase. These sudden hot flushes are caused by lower estrogen levels, which can confuse the brain's typical regulation of internal temperature. These episodes can feel really disconcerting and disruptive. Acupuncture for Menopause Treatment and Menopause Supplements [Studies have shown that acupuncture treatments can reduce the frequency of hot flashes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782712). As few as three treatments produced significant positive results, while a full course of treatment (at least eight sessions) provided relief for many women for up to six months. In addition to relieving hot flashes, acupuncture also improves quality of life in many other ways: reducing headaches and other body aches, alleviating anxiety and depression, and improving sleep. TCM also offers [customized herbal formulae](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222383) that support the body's hormone balance and help with menopause symptom relief. In many ways, the effects of perimenopause and menopause are not quantifiable, as some are more emotional in nature. This change occurs not just in the body, but in the mind. At this time, a woman is seeing herself differently, reevaluating her own sense of identity and purpose, and in some cases, shifting her focus and energies in life. Acupuncture for PMS Symptoms and Menopause Physically, a woman goes through many significant changes over the years, and different factors come into play. If a woman's body is out of balance \u2014 due to trauma, stress, illness, injury, diet, environment, etc.-she may experience difficulties with her female organ function. Painful periods, irregular periods, cysts, fibroids and endometriosis are all common conditions \u2014 but they do not happen without some imbalances causing them. A lifetime of choices, experiences, pains and pleasures add up to create the health status we live with now, in this moment. [Women's health issues](https://myartofwellness.com/womens-health-fertility-tcm/) can be addressed, at any stage of life, with acupuncture and herbs, as well as the right kind of food and lifestyle choices. If a woman finds and partners with a good healthcare practitioner, and practices a lifestyle that helps her achieve optimal health, she does not have to suffer through years of PMS, unpleasant symptoms during pregnancy like [morning sickness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-morning-sickness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), nor through years of menopausal symptoms, either. Unfortunately, many women do not know there is an alternative to using pain relief medicines, oral contraceptives and hormone replacement to manage symptoms. These drugs do not offer a real solution to the problems; they mask them. As women, we are often expected to simply accept these problems and learn to cope. But why settle for that, when we have the means to correct them? What is a Natural Remedy for Hot Flashes? Acupuncture and Menopause Supplements TCM looks at female care as \"ovarian care.\" Besides paying attention to our liver, heart, lungs, and kidneys, we also focus on menstrual and premenstrual care, pregnancy and postpartum care, and menopause care. These are unique to women. The ovaries are the major players when it comes to female hormones, cycles, and reproductive health. Girls, young women and older women can all benefit from regular treatment, herbal supplementation, and lifestyle improvements to encourage healthy and smooth functioning of these processes. If, as a younger woman, you are able to manage your hormones, then, when menopause comes, it hopefully will not be too much of a problem. If you are already experiencing menopause symptoms, it is not too late to get Yin and Yang balance restored, so that you can enjoy this phase of life and many healthy years to come! [According to TCM, most menopausal disorders](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/menopause/) fall under kidney and/or liver Yin deficiency. This manifests in hot flashes, waking often at night around 3:00-4:00 a.m., dreamy light sleep, irritability, memory loss, dry eyes, mood swings, and irregular periods. A smaller percentage of symptoms fall under kidney Yang deficiency; low back soreness, incontinence, water retention, [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), indigestion, and weight gain. We use very specific acupuncture points to help with each of these different problems, and are able to treat each woman's unique combination of issues. We also have our unique techniques (needling and massage) and herbal products to [help skin stay firm and smooth](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/). 8 Self-Care Best Practices for Menopause Acupuncture and herbal modalities have been taking care of these women's health issues for thousands of years. Besides seeking these professional services, there are many things you can do at home to facilitate a smooth transition: - For Yin deficiency, stick with cooling and juicy foods like fresh veggies, fruit, yams, sweet rice, mung beans, lotus roots or seeds. Stay away from alcohol, coffee, and spicy foods which increase internal fire or heat. Snacking on Goji berries is recommended, drinking chrysanthemum tea, chamomile tea or Art of Wellness's own Night Tea can help you rest and sleep better. - For Yang deficiency, drink warm lemon water upon rising, eat more cooked and warm food, nuts, especially walnuts and pecans, stay away from dairy, icy foods and drinks and greasy, heavy meals. 20-30 minute hot foot spa before bedtime is recommended. Rub the low back along the midline of the spine and on both sides until very warm. - For saggy or loose skin, facial rejuvenation acupuncture needling will help stimulate collagen production and improve facial circulation. - Speed-walk 30-45 minutes per day. - Rub hands to warm them, then rub the soles of each foot 100 times. Practice daily. - Meditate 20 minutes daily, in the morning or ideally, at bedtime. - Suggested Menopause Meditation: focus on the lower abdominal area (Dan Tian), until it feels warm. Then, move the warm sensation into your kidney area. - Try this Lotus smoothie recipe. Good for anyone, but especially for women experiencing menopausal symptoms: \u00bd cup lotus seed, \u00bd lily bulbs, 1 tablespoon mung beans, 1 tablespoon sweet rice, 10 pieces of honey dates. Rinse all ingredients but dates. Add 6 cups of water, cook for 20 minutes. Blend. Garnish with a few goji berries. Make 4 servings. Serve warm for breakfast, or cold for an afternoon snack. Feel free to add fruit, such as banana, berries, apple, pear, etc. If you or a woman you care about is experiencing menopause symptoms, look for acupuncture near me, and call [Art of Wellness](https://myartofwellness.com/contact/), Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA.

[ How to Treat Stress with TCM and Acupuncture ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) by Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Nowadays, we hear pretty constantly that everyone is \"under a lot of stress.\" But what is stress? [Stress](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11874-stress) is a natural reaction in the body to any difficulties or changes that we face in life. Stress affects health at every level: physically, mentally, and emotionally. Stress can bring a lot of negative effects to your health and your career. [TCM and acupuncture offer a unique treatment to stress management](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/) without any of the side effects that anti-depression drugs cause. [Acupuncture treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/) often brings people immediate stress relief, as they leave the clinic feeling calm, relaxed, sometime even euphoric. But TCM and acupuncture can also provide meaningful reduction in the toxic effects of long-term stress over time. In this [article](https://myartofwellness.com/dont-let-stress-hijack-health/) we will discuss stressors, stress symptoms, and how to combat the negative effects of stress on your body, mind and spirit. What Are Stress Symptoms? \"But he was so young!\" \"But there wasn't anything wrong with her!\" Have you heard of someone you know-maybe a friend or a relative, maybe someone famous you admire-dying, suddenly? It's hard to take it in; we don't want to believe that these things can happen, especially when someone is only middle aged. It forces us to look at our own lives. Are we taking the time to take care of ourselves? Or are we rushing around from one crisis to another, always stressed out? Stress is the body's natural reaction to any difficulties that appear in our lives, physically or emotionally. It's a normal response to adverse conditions. It's actually healthy to experience some low-degree, short-term stress occasionally, because this lets the body practice protecting itself. Unfortunately, our modern lifestyle creates a lot of stressful situations for us to endure, and most people are not taught or encouraged to release the effects of stress from their bodies and minds. When stress builds up, it can lead to health problems. It may be that when you go to an M.D. who orders tests, nothing shows up in a scan or a blood test. But that does not mean you don't have a serious problem. Chronic stress can cause a variety of symptoms and illnesses and affect overall health and well-being. Many diseases, including [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037818/), can be linked to stress. Job changes, the illness or death of a family member, relationship issues, financial or business difficulties, caring for and educating children - we all face these stressors at one time or another. For some people, the problems begin in childhood. If a child experiences trauma-parents fighting, or bullying at school, for example-that kind of severe stress can develop into permanent health problems as he or she grows up. What Does Stress Do to Your Body? Stress can affect all systems in the body. It starts with the central nervous system and the endocrine system. When something unusual happens, the brain gets a signal: something needs to be done! The brain sends out a message, alerting the body to start producing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline increases the heart rate, elevates the blood pressure and boosts energy supplies. Cortisone increases sugar in the bloodstream, enhances the brain's use of glucose and increases the body's ability to repair tissues. The body's initial reaction to stress is to protect itself. But if you are under this kind of stress constantly-think about it-your body will keep producing adrenaline, causing the heart to beat constantly at a high rate and keep the [blood pressure high](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/). Eventually, the body will become [exhausted](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), leading to [chronic fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3148561/), hypertension, diabetes, risk of stroke and heart attack. The lungs become vulnerable, which can trigger asthma, and allergic reactions such as [eczema](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-eczema-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or [hives rash](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hives-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). When the cortisone level is high, it causes a constant immune response. Eventually, the immune system becomes imbalanced. When stressful periods are prolonged, the body can lose the ability to shut off the alert that says something is wrong: what we call the \"fight or flight\" response. Say you send a soldier to a war zone. The soldier's job is to shoot the enemy. When the enemy approaches, the soldier starts to shoot. But if the soldier is there fighting for days, weeks, years, and his job is to keep shooting, at some point he stops recognizing who is an enemy or who is an ally. He will shoot anybody. Likewise, the body loses the ability to recognize what is good and what is not good. Stressful life events are often a main factor in the onset of [an autoimmune condition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568997215002621), like ALS, MS, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis. When a person has experienced shocking, perhaps life-threatening, events such as being attacked or surviving in a war zone, he or she may exhibit [PTSD symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). When a person is under chronic stress, the liver has to work much harder. We rely on the liver to clean the blood, but if it gets tired out, it can't do its job. So toxins don't always come from outside the body; they can come from stress, when the body becomes more acidic and toxic, increasing inflammation and risk of cancer. Liver Qi problems are a major factor in women's health problems, including [PMS and PMDD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). When we're upset, the appetite changes, causing us to eat too much or too little, affecting our nutrition. Many digestive problems are related to long term stress: heartburn and reflux, ulcers, cramping, nausea, vomiting, obesity, constipation, bloat, IBS, diarrhea. Sometimes stress shows itself externally, on the [surface of the skin](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/), as with eczema or psoriasis. Stress causes the muscles to become tight and makes the nerves more sensitive. This causes more pain and inflammation. The reproductive system and the sex drive are, naturally, affected by hormone imbalances. For women, this can cause PMS, fertility issues related to ovarian function, blocked tubes, or unstable uterine lining, and more severe menopausal symptoms. For men, long term stress can cause the testosterone level to drop, the prostate and the urethra to become inflamed and prone to infection. With all of this, it is no wonder that libido and sexual function [(erectile dysfunction)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) take a dive, too. Stress Management by TCM and Acupuncture TCM is based on the philosophy that the body, mind, and spirit are inextricably linked. It is only in recent years that Western science has begun to acknowledge the connection between the emotions and our physical health. In TCM, we always look at the whole person. If the emotions are out of balance, the body's functions will be, too. Keep in mind that without a spirit, the body is nothing more than a container: a box. Likewise, if the body is not healthy, the spirit doesn't have a good home to live in. That is why we treat stress, emotional fluctuations, and balance the body's organ systems all at the same time [with acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/). Acupuncture is one great way to help you manage your stress and protect you from permanent health damage. Even though you may not be able to avoid stress, you do have the power to manage stress better so that it can't build up, hurt you internally, and turn into serious health issues. Top 7 Habits for Stress Relief Every day, we encounter people and situations that cause frustration. Sometimes several minor incidents over the course of a day can build up until we feel we are at the end of our ability to cope. Other times, we are hit with a big problem that we have no choice but to face. These stressors are unavoidable. What we can do is pay attention to our responses, and train ourselves to respond more calmly when situations arise. Here are some things you can do in your daily life to manage stress. - Change the way you view problems. It is human nature to protect ourselves from danger by recognizing the negative energies coming at us. But we can become too accustomed to looking for the \"dark side.\"A lot of time we needlessly take things negatively. Say you wake up to the sounds of a bird, chattering in a tree. You can think, \"Ah, the beautiful music of nature!\" Or you can get annoyed. Same situation, different response. Learn how to think positively. Often I ask a patient to \"show me your hand.\" They show me the palm side, but don't think to look at the back of the hand. In the world, nothing can exist that has one side only. This is the concept of Yin and Yang; nothing is only good or only bad. There is good and bad in everything. Learn to pay attention to both, but \"accentuate the positive.\" - Connect yourself to nature; consciously choose to make yourself one with the Universe. Connect to energy outside of yourself by going to the mountains or the beach, walking barefoot on the sand and listening to the waves. Sit by a river and feel the flow of the water. When you feel anger inside, go out and face something - a mountain, or the woods - breathe out, remove that negative energy from your body, absorb positive energy; make that exchange. By doing this, you gain the perspective of playing a small, yet integral part within the greatness of the universe. This will release stress and give you new strength. - Learn some techniques: Tai Chi, yoga, meditation, Qi Gong. Tai Chi, for example, trains you physically and emotionally at the same time, cultivating your internal Qi. Deep breathing will make your body more balanced and calm; exhale negative energy and inhale fresh air and energy. - Engage in regular physical activity, especially cardiovascular varieties. Walk, jog, bike, swim. Going outdoors, getting fresh air and sunshine, is even more beneficial than going to the gym. - Encourage yourself to engage in some social activity. Stress can cause sadness and depression. People tend to close themselves off. So, you must push yourself to go out, keep up your activities. Talking with friends will release the stagnation from your body and mind. Sign up to volunteer; helping other people will reduce your stress. - Take time for a hobby. Whatever you enjoy: walking, swimming, reading, listening to music, going to dance class, fishing, golfing. Do it regularly. But it should be something active for your body or mind. Inactive pastimes- like watching television or playing video games, surfing the internet-may seem relaxing, but they can actually increase stress long term. Keep time spent on those passive activities to a minimum. - Work on your sense of humor! When you laugh, you are happier and so are others around you. Be generous with your positive energy and others will be there to help you when you need it. Managing stress will pay off, not only by making you happier, but probably also allowing you to enjoy a longer and healthier life. Practicing stress management will help you to recover from existing conditions and prevent other issues from becoming serious in the future.

[ How to Sleep Better with Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Do you suffer from [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/) or do you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep? [Acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/) and [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine/) offers many solutions on how to sleep better without sleeping aids. TCM stresses the importance of getting a good night sleep. Chinese medicine has tools such as; exercise, Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, and meditation all which can help you get a good sleep so you can function at the highest potential throughout the day. Below you will read about TCM and the history it provides in regards to sleep and the many tips that can help you get the best sleep tonight. History of Sleep with TCM Sleep is a part of the interplay of yin and yang: yang energy is dominant when we are awake and active, and yin energy rules sleep. Night is yin; daylight is yang. This is all in keeping with the holistic, universal nature of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) theory. Our bodies are designed to work with the movements of the earth, sun, and moon. When a person experiences insomnia, either hard to fall asleep or wake up often then difficult to fall back to sleep, there is a lack of balance. The body is out of sync with its environment. The yang energy is taking over, or not interplaying with yin appropriately. In TCM terminology, \"Shen\" is the spirit, the energy which controls our mental activities and thought. During sleep, Shen \"hides\" in the organs - predominantly the Heart and the Liver - resting, so that it can function with sharpness during our waking hours. Insomnia, in TCM, is often viewed, then, as a problem of the Heart system, or the Liver system. If one of these major organs is unable to \"house\" the Shen, then the Shen will wander restlessly, causing sleeplessness. Protective Qi cycles through the body continuously, but it follows different paths along the meridians at different times of the day and night. During the day, protective Qi, which fights off pathogens, moves through the yang meridians, and during the night, it flows through the yin meridians. If you find yourself waking up at a particular hour in the middle of the night every night - or feeling sluggish at one particular time every day - it is probably related to some deficiency of Qi in that area. Between the hours between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m. the liver meridian is actively supplying Qi to the liver system so that it can clean toxins from the blood. Then, between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m., the freshly cleaned blood and energy is being delivered to the organ systems. It is especially important to be sleeping soundly during that time. The liver does all the heavy lifting of cleaning and detoxifying the blood and therefore, the whole body. If the liver is stinted of its full rest and rejuvenation, night after night, we can be left feeling truly sick and tired. Sleeplessness may be the central problem for some people; for others, it's just a part of the big picture. Many people have gone so long without restful sleep that they have become used to it and just consider it their new \"normal.\" When you come in to [Art of Wellness](https://www.myartofwellness.com) for a visit, our doctors will ask many questions to get a sense of what kind of sleep problems you're having, including other symptoms that may be related to the same root issue. - Having trouble falling asleep may be related to an excess condition of the liver and/or gall bladder. - Waking easily and then having trouble falling back to sleep may point to a deficiency of the Heart Yin or too much internal heat. - Nightmares may indicate a gall bladder meridian problem, while repetitive, literal dreams (about work, for example) might indicate a heart/spleen problem. Sleep problems can be related to other conditions, such as depression, menopause in women, fibromyalgia, [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and cardiovascular disease. How to Make Winter A Time of Rest and Renewal Getting a good night sleep is always important, but in the Wintertime. Nature and our bodies are really asking us to rest more, and more deeply, than we do during other times of the year. This is a time for the body to store energy. If we go at a frantic pace, and behave the same way we do in the middle of summer, we will become depleted. Unfortunately, our current culture does not necessarily support this idea. It seems we are asked to do more and be more than ever during the rush of the winter holiday season. It really is vital to prioritize \"doing less\" in order to preserve good health. People with sleep problems seek [tips](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/healthy-sleep-tips) for help. The practices in acupuncture and TCM help you to be calm. Visit the link and read some TCM tips for sleep. Top 20 Tips For Creating Calm so That You Can Get A Good Sleep - Choose carefully how many social commitments you make. You don't have to attend every gathering - only the ones that are meaningful to you. If it feels more like an obligation than fun, make a plan to stop in, extend your greetings, and then leave early. This way, you won't overeat, drink too much, and you can still get to bed a reasonable hour - Don't [exercise](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/17-tips-to-sleep-better)too vigorously close to bedtime. An evening walk, or gentle program of Tai Qi or yoga will help you work out excess energy with stimulating you further - Deep breaking techniques: using you lower abdomen, inhale deeply. Hold it for about 5 seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat ten times. Deep breathing exercises not only relax your mind, but they help to dispel negative Qi from the body before bed - Create an oasis of calm in your bedroom, with good ventilation, restful colors and no devices. Set a time, half an hour to hour before going to bed, when you will discontinue watching TV or looking at your computer and phone. The light stimulus from the screen is not helpful for falling asleep. Reading a book, writing in a journal, coloring in a coloring book, are all activities that help you wind down for the night. - Change your [eating habits](http://choosemyplate.gov): many people wake up around 3 AM and find it difficult to fall back asleep. This may be cause by low blood sugar level due to the over activity for the adrenal gland. For a better sleep, try to balance your blood sugar level daily by eating small portions of food about every 3 hours and drinking a glass of warm, low fat milk or eating a handful of nuts\u2014such as raw walnuts or almonds, before bedtime. It helps to balance your blood sugar. Waking up in the middle of the night can be caused by fluctuating insulin levels - the result of too much sugar or alcohol in the evening. - Keep your feet warm by soaking them in hot water for 15-20 minutes before bedtime. Also, massaging the bottom of the feet can help to stimulate key kidney points. Give a good, fast rub to the center of your soles for a few minutes to warm them while getting into bed. - Stimulating acupressure points just before bedtime can be helpful. Use your thumb or fingertip to apply moderate pressure and rotate clockwise for 2-3 minutes. - Shen Men, called the \"Spiritual gate\" point, releases heart fire, excitement, anger, irritation and anxiety. - Tai Chong, a liver point can help alleviate insomnia due to excessive heat or stagnation in the liver, which can cause feelings of depression, stress, sadness. - Take off any constricting clothing (underwear), and wear loose, comfortable pajamas for bedtime. - There is an old saying: \"sleep like the crescent moon.\" Sleeping in a fetal position on your right side puts your heart above your liver, which helps drain blood, giving the heart some relief and extra nourishment to the liver. It also helps food move through your digestive system properly. - Keep away from interruptions: Turn off your phone after dinner or keep a note book by your bed. If you keep thinking about sometime important to do, write it down. - Listen to calm and relaxing music - Sleep and wake at the same time every day, yes that includes weekends. Do not stay in bed for too long even when you do not have to go to work. Your body needs to have a regular sleep-wake cycle in order to function at its maximum - Reduce the water temperature for baths and showers: when the water temperature is well about body temperature, your body heat increases. Then when you get out of the water, your body heat decreases. Try to avoid such fluctuation of the body temperature. - Keep your bedroom simple and clean: limit the number of electronic devices such as TV's, computers from your bed room - Do not play video games at night - Obey the 20-minute rule: if you do not successfully fall asleep in twenty minutes, get up and do something else until you feel tired and ready to sleep again. - Waterfall Meditation. In this exercise, imagine yourself at the base of a waterfall. As you breathe in and out, picture the water gently raining down on you, trickling down each route until the tension inside you releases, allowing your entire body to enter a peaceful and relaxed state. - Oneness Meditation. Just as in the Waterfall exercise, picture yourself standing beneath a waterfall.
