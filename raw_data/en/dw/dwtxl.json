How essential oils are used for good health and wellness.", "sitename": "The Jackson Sun", "date": "2017-05-12", "cleaned_text": "Essential oils, the power of natural remedies In 1993, Treva Maitland delivered twin boys 14 weeks prematurely. After doctors said the boys would not survive, both were released by 11 months. \"I said 'one miracle down and a whole bunch to go,'\" Maitland said. One of the twins was immune to antibiotics, so when he was diagnosed with pneumonia at 2 years old, Maitland and her family did not know what to do to treat him. She finally called upon a chiropractor friend who believed in natural solutions and suggested that they rub essential oils on the boy's back. The essential oils worked for her son, but Maitland still wasn't convinced. \"My experience with essential oils had been good, but they had not been great,\" Maitland said. Twenty years later, Maitland was experiencing a hot flash while selling her handmade jewelry at a conference. Essential Oil Educator Krisann Blair was at the conference selling oils and offered her peppermint oil to rub on the back of her neck. \"It shocked me because it was so potent and effective and so fast,\" Maitland said. Maitland has been using essential oils ever since and claims that is has made her immune system better and helped her family tremendously. \"It's been a sincere blessing in our lives,\" she said. \"It doesn't take long to realize the benefits, all you have to do is use them.\" Although she never advocates for people to stop seeing doctors and using traditional medicine, she does recommend trying quality essential oils for minor issues, she noted. Blair and Maitland both sell doTERRA essential oils and educate people on all the ways they can used. \"Essential oils have a whole wide realm of ways that you can use them,\" Blair said. They can be used for cooking, as fabric softener, for cleaning, as pest control, health and wellness, mood control and for crafts among other things, she said. Blair's main goal is to help people create healthier homes, she said. \"I just like having an alternative, or natural solutions,\" Blair said. \"Many people are surprised at the effectiveness of something so simple.\" Most cleaning supplies are made with a lot of chemicals that can make people sick, so she uses essential oils to make her own. Blair teaches webinars, does demonstrations and meets with people one-on-one to educate them about essential oils and how they can help.
