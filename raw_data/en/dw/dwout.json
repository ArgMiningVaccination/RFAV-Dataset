Previous Publications 197 4Annual report 2000ABOUT THE COMMITTEES This is the tenth joint annual report of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), the Committee onMutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment(COM) and the Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, ConsumerProducts and the Environment (COC). The aim of these reports is to provide a brieftoxicological background to the Committees'decisions. The year 2000 has seen changes in the administration of the Committees. With the formation of the Food Standards Agency on 1 April 2000, the Secretariats becamethe joint responsibilities of the Food Standards Agency and the Department ofHealth. The Food Standards Agency has prime responsibility for the COTand theDepartment of Health for the COM and COC. The terms of reference of theCommittees has been changed to include the Food Standards Agency in the list ofdepartments and bodies to which the Committees provide advice (see Annex 1). Members of the COT, COM and COC are appointed by the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Chairman of the Food Standards Agency. The Committees advisethe CMO and the Chairman, and through them, the Government. Anumber of important changes have been made in recent years in the way Government departments are required to deal with appointments to the advisorycommittees for which they have responsibility. These principles are set out in theNolan Report on Standards in Public Life. Arising from this, all futureappointments to the COT, COM and COC will follow the best practice set out inGuidance issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments(OCPA). Appointments are made on the basis of merit, to form committees with abalance of relevant skills and backgrounds. The appointment process will be openand Departments will be required to justify any departures from best practice.Members are appointed for fixed time periods, generally three years, and areeligible for reappointment at the end of their terms. It will, however, be unusual fora member to be appointed beyond the 10 year maximum allowed for in the OCPAGuidance. In common with other independent advisory committees the members are required to follow a Code of Conduct which also gives guidance on how the commercialinterests should be declared. Members are required to declare any commercialinterests on appointment and, again, during meetings if a topic arises in which theyhave an interest. If a member declares a specific interest in a topic underdiscussion, he or she may, at the Chairman's discretion, be allowed to take part inthe discussion, but they are excluded from decision making. The Code of Conductis at Annex 2 and Annex 3 describes the Committees'policy on openness. 5Annual report 2000Annex 4 contains a glossary of technical terms used in the text. Annex 5 is an alphabetical index to subjects and substances considered in previous reports.Previous publications of the Committees are listed in Annex 6. The usual way in which committee reviews are conducted is that the relevant Secretariat critically assesses all the relevant data and prepares papers for thecommittee. These normally consist of appendices giving detailed summaries of thestudies reviewed - methodology and results - and a covering paper in which theavailable data are briefly summarised, the most important points highlighted andrecommendations presented for discussion by the Committee. Although originalstudy reports are not routinely circulated to members, they are made available onrequest and are circulated if the study is particularly complex. Definitivesummaries are necessary because documentation on any one chemical can amountto many hundreds of pages. The Committees cannot undertake to reviewinformation provided by individuals, industry or other organisations that has notbeen forwarded through, or discussed with, the appropriate Secretariat. Many of the reviews conducted by the Committees are done so at the request of other Government Departments, and the Committee Secretariats liaise closely withcolleagues in these Departments. The Committees offer advice independently ofeach other in their areas of expertise but will, if need be, work closely together.This is helped by the Secretariats'close working relationship, which is nowmaintained by the sharing of responsibilities between the Food Standards Agencyand Department of Health. If, for example, during a review of a particular chemicalby the COT, it becomes clear that there is need for expert advice on mutagenicity orcarcinogenicity aspects, it will be referred to COM or COC as appropriate. Thesethree Committees also provide expert advice to other advisory committees, such asthe Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes and the Food AdvisoryCommittee. There are also links with the Veterinary Products Committee and theAdvisory Committee on Pesticides. The Committees'procedures for openness include the publication of agendas, finalised minutes, agreed conclusions and statements. These are now published onthe internet at the following addresses: COT: http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk/committees/cot/summary.htm COM: http://www.doh.gov.uk/com.htm COC: http://www.doh.gov.uk/coc.htm This report contains summaries of the discussions and includes the Committees' published statements in full in order to fulfil the obligation to publish statementsboth electronically and in hard copy. 6Annual report 2000COMMITTEE ON TOXICITY OF CHEMICALS IN FOOD,CONSUMER PRODUCTSAND THE ENVIRONMENT 7Annual report 2000Preface The COThas again discussed a wide range of toxicological problems over the past year. Many of these have related to chemicals that may be present in food,including additives (intense sweeteners), processing aids (enzymes), supplements(French Maritime Pine Bark Extracts), food contact materials (terephthalic andisophthalic acids), natural constituents (fluorine, bromine and dioxin-like polychlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls have formed three separate discussionitems, with consideration of results of general dietary exposure, of a specificsurvey of free-range eggs as an indicator of environmental exposure, and the start ofa major review of the tolerable daily intake of these contaminants. The COThas also been asked to advise on the safety of breast implants, on an environmental pollutant, on aspects of research commissioned by the FoodStandards Agency and the Department of Health and on papers dealing with theworkings of scientific advisory committees. We are pleased to note that theCommittee already follows most of the procedures considered to constitute bestpractice for advisory committees. 2000 was also a busy year for COTWorking Groups. An open meeting was held in February to consult on the draft report of the Working Group on Food Intolerance.The final report from this Working Group was published in July 2000, under thetitle \"Adverse Reactions to Food and Food Ingredients\". Two new Working Groupscommenced work during the year, on Phytoestrogens in April, and on RiskAssessment for Mixtures of Pesticides/Veterinary Medicines in December, andexpect to report in 2001 and 2002, respectively. The predominance of food-related issues in the COTagendas led to the decision that the lead responsibility for the Secretariat should be moved to the Food StandardsAgency, on its formation in April 2000. As in previous years, we have been well served by the Secretariat who have continued to ensure the smooth-running of the Committee proceedings and haveprovided working documents of the highest quality. Professor H F Woods (Chairman) BSc BM DPhil FFPM FIFSTHonFFOM FRCP(London & Edinburgh) 9Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Adverse Reactions to Food and Food Ingredients 1.1 The COTWorking Group on Food Intolerance completed its review of adverse reactions to food. Adraft report was the subject of consultation at anopen meeting of the COTin February 2000 and the final report was publishedin July 2000. The report, entitled \"Adverse Reactions to Food and FoodIngredients\" may be obtained from the COTsecretariat at: The FoodStandards Agency, Room 511C, Aviation House, Kingsway, London WC2B6NH or by contacting Food Standards Agency Publications, PO Box 369,Hayes, Middlesex UB3 1UT(tel: Alitame 1.2 Alitame is an intense sweetener that was initially considered by the COTin 1989. Additional data were submitted during the period 1990-1994 and in1998, both in response to requests made by the COTand as a result ofrequests made to the company by other regulatory bodies. 1.3 In 1998, the COTestablished an Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.3 mg/kg bw per day. This was subsequently confirmed in 1999, following submission ofadditional information by the company. The basis for determining theAcceptable Daily Intake was a significant elevation in liver weight in dogstreated with alitame for 18 months. There was a significant increase in liverweight at 500 mg/kg bw per day and a non-significant increase in male dogsreceiving the next lowest dose (100 mg/kg bw per day). The COTconsideredthat this finding was unusual and that it would be prudent to regard the doseof 100 mg/kg bw per day as a LOAEL. Consequently, the NOAELderivedfor alitame was 30 mg/kg bw per day, the lowest dose tested. Uncertaintyfactors of 10 for inter-species and 10 for intra-individual variability were thenapplied, resulting in the Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.3 mg/kg bw per day. 1.4 The COThad also previously noted other observations of potential concern. Enzyme induction was reported in the dog study, with a NOAELof 100mg/kg bw per day. Astudy in diabetics given alitame 10 mg/kg bw for 90days, had reported a number of cardiovascular complications in some patientsof both the alitame and placebo groups during the follow-up period. 1.5 In 2000, the company submitted the results of a new, more comprehensive study in which diabetics were administered alitame at 10 mg/kg bw per day.Particular emphasis was given to cardiovascular effects, the results indicatingthat alitame was well-tolerated and therefore the company asked for theAcceptable Daily Intake to be increased. 10Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.6 The COTnoted that the diabetic studies had not included an assessment of enzyme induction, and the results of statistical analysis of the new study werequestioned. The COTagreed that the new data were not adequate to justifydecreasing the uncertainty factor and therefore did not warrant review of theAcceptable Daily Intake for alitame. Breast implants 1.7 In 1999 the COTprovided an emergency consideration for the Department of Health and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) on the safety of breastimplants containing soya bean oil. This contributed to the voluntarywithdrawal of the Trilucent' breast implant due to a lack of adequate safetydata. The MDAsubsequently initiated a review on the safety and performanceof all recently introduced breast implant fillers. 1.8 MDAreviewed the technical information provided by one manufacturer, Poly Implant Prosthesis, on their hydroxylpropyl cellulose hydrogel pre-filledbreast implant. MDAasked the COTto consider the report of a study inwhich rats received subcutaneous injections of the filler material and werethen observed for periods of up to 12 weeks. 1.9 The COTconsidered the rat study to be very limited in nature. There were serious deficiencies in the design, performance and reporting of the study.COTconcluded that the findings of the rat study could not be discounted andsuggested that a study employing a considerably longer period of observationshould be conducted on the filler material. Astatement outlining theconclusions reached by the COTis included at the end of this report. 1.10 On receipt of these conclusions MDAinitiated regulatory activity which led to the voluntary withdrawal of these implants by the manufacturer. This was aprecautionary measure until sufficient information to address MDA'sconcerns over the manufacturer's biological safety assessment of the device isavailable. The withdrawal was made public by an MDADevice Alert (MDADA2000(07)) on 11 December 2000. 1.11 On 5 December MDArequested an emergency consideration of data on a second hydrogel filling material used in NovaGold' breast implants. Thisfilling material was a polyvinylpyrrolidone and guar gum gel. As described inthe 1999 Annual Report, emergency consideration can be undertaken with theagreement of the COTChairman and provides the collated opinions of alimited number of individual members with particularly relevant expertise.The information was circulated to a number of members on 5 December.Their opinions were received by 8 December and were passed to MDA.MDAreleased an MDADevice Alert (MDADA2000(08)) on 11 December, 11Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentwhich identified inadequacies in the manufacturer's biological safety assessment and concluded that as a precautionary measure these implantsshould not be implanted until the concerns have been addressed. Code of Practice for Scientific Advisory Committees 1.12 In July 2000, the Office of Science and Technology published a consultation paper, inviting comments on a proposed code of practice for ScientificAdvisory Committees. The paper outlined proposed guidelines for ScientificAdvisory Committees and complemented a second document on \"Review OfRisk Procedures Used By The Government's Advisory Committees DealingWith Food Safety\", which was published in September 2000 and alsodiscussed by the COT(see paragraphs 1.72 - 1.78). The consultation paperdescribed the duties, rights and responsibilities of committee members andtheir independence from the committee's secretariat, stressing the need forinclusivity, transparency and proportionality and raising the issue of themanner in which confidential information is handled. It stressed the need forclear explanation of levels and types of uncertainty, and how this informationis incorporated into advice, and called for training of committee members incommunication skills. 1.13 The Secretariat noted that producing a set of uniform guidelines would enable interested parties, the public and the media to judge and comment on thestandards required of such committees. 1.14 Members agreed that the COTalready follows the procedures defined as far as is practicable. COTnoted that considerable steps have been made toincrease transparency. However there was concern that publication of somematerial or attribution of comments made during a meeting couldcompromise personal security. 1.15 Members also discussed the issue of confidential papers and noted that steps have been taken to reduce or eliminate use of material classified asconfidential. Where commercial confidentiality precluded full publication, itwas suggested that at least part of the paper and the Committee'sdeliberations should be published. The Secretariat informed Members thatwhere material was \"commercial in confidence\", it is normal procedure toapproach companies to determine whether they would be willing for part, ifnot all, of the papers concerning their product to be made publicly available.(Procedures for openness are outlined in Annex 3). 12Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.16 Members noted the suggestion that Chairs and Secretariats should review board members interests, taking into account: \"the proportion of the totalequity value which is held\" (where share holdings are under consideration).It was stressed that it is well-established COTprocedure to tabulateMembers'interests in the annual report, but that it would be difficult toquantify interests. 1.17 With regard to Secretariat duties, Members noted that the COTwould continue to encourage submission of Secretariat reviews to journals forpublication in peer-reviewed journals. Dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs - Dietary exposure 1.18 COTwas asked to consider estimates of dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs derived from the 1997 Total Diet Study. Dietary exposuresto dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs had previously been estimated from the 1982and 1992 Total Diet Studies. Since these earlier data were published, theWHO had recommended /revised Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs) fordioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, which were endorsed by the COTin 1998.Therefore, the 1982 and 1992 exposure estimates had been recalculated usingthese latest WHO-TEFs in order to be directly comparable with the new data. 1.19 In comparison with earlier similar surveys, dietary exposures to dioxin-like compounds, on a total toxic equivalent (TEQ) basis, for all three age groups,showed a continuing downward trend. 1.20 COTagreed the data indicated that changes in analytical sensitivity, or in the number of food groups analysed, had not contributed significantly to thedecline in exposure. COTtherefore agreed it should be stressed that thedecline in exposure to these compounds was real and not an experimentalartefact. 1.21 The COTagreed a statement (included at the end of this report) on dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, concluding that the currentconcentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food are unlikely to pose arisk to health. 13Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentDioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in free range eggs 1.22 COTwas informed of a Food Standards Agency survey of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in free-range hen and duck eggs. The aim of the survey wasto examine the use of eggs as indicators of environmental contamination andthe results were not considered as being representative of free-range eggs onsale throughout the UK. 1.23 Dietary exposure had been estimated using the concentrations of these compounds in free-range eggs together with age-specific food consumptiondata, and used different scenarios based upon average or maximumconcentrations in the eggs. 1.24 Advice was sought from the COTon the public health significance of the estimated dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs based on datafrom this survey of free-range eggs. Members were also asked to considerwhether the survey was sufficiently robust to draw conclusions applicable toconsumers of free-range eggs and whether the different exposure scenarioswere realistic with respect to anticipated consumption patterns of free-rangeeggs. 1.25 COTagreed that the survey should be considered as a hypothesis generating study, indicating that analysis of free-range eggs is a potentially usefultechnique for investigating environmental contamination. However, becauseof the sampling methodology and the limited number of samples taken, thedata from this survey should not be used to estimate dietary exposures tothese compounds for consumers of free-range eggs. There was also a paucityof data on concentrations of these compounds in other types of eggs, such asbattery hen eggs, against which meaningful comparisons could be made. 1.26 The COTstatement on the survey is included at the end of this report. Di-isopropylnaphthalenes 1.27 Di-isopropylnaphthalenes (DIPN) are used as solvents for the colour former in carbonless copy-paper, which may be included in recycled paper used inmaking board for food-packaging. Treatment of the recycled fibres may failto remove all of the DIPN and thus some may be present in the finished boardand could migrate into food. The Committee gave consideration to a surveyon DIPN during 1998, and agreed that the toxicological information wasinadequate and that additional studies should be submitted within 3 years.(See paragraphs 1.5 - 1.6 of 1998 Annual Report). 14Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.28 COM reviewed new mutagenicity data on DIPN in February 2000. It concluded that DIPN could be regarded as non-mutagenic and that no furthermutagenicity testing was required (see paragraphs 2.11 - 2.12 of this report).COTwas asked whether, in light of the new mutagenicity data and the advicefrom the COM, it wished to revise its previous position on DIPN and itsearlier requirement for a long-term study. 1.29 The COTconsidered that, even though DIPN could be regarded as non- mutagenic, there was still a need for further safety studies. In view of the factthat there were no longer concerns that DIPN may be a genotoxic carcinogen,and that intakes of DIPN were low, a carcinogenicity study was no longerrequired. Instead the COTagreed that a 28-day sighting study for doseselection, followed by a 90-day study would be acceptable. Because the dataon human exposure levels are limited, the Committee stressed the importanceof ensuring that appropriate dose levels were used in the proposed studies,achieving some toxicity at the highest dose. 1.30 COTre-iterated its previous advice that it would be prudent to ensure that the levels of DIPN in food packaging made from recycled paper and boardshould be kept as low as reasonably practicable. Enzyme submission - Amano 90 1.31 COTconsidered the Amano 90 submission by postal consultation in 1999. At that time COTrequired further evidence to support the company's claim thatno residual enzyme activity would be expected in bread after baking, furthervalidation of the enzyme assays and an increase in the frequency of testingfor mycotoxins and antibacterial activity. COTagreed to recommend a twelvemonth temporary clearance of Amano 90 for use in bread making, whileawaiting the additional data from the company. 1.32 In response the company had submitted the results of a study aiming to demonstrate that Amano 90 is inactivated during the baking process, togetherwith data on the repeatability of the assay used to determine enzyme activity.The company also provided written assurance that one in every four batchesof Amano 90 would be tested for mycotoxins and antibacterial activity. 1.33 In the study submitted, Amano 90 was added to flour, at the recommended concentration and also at a 40-fold higher concentration, either prior to orsubsequent to baking. Enzyme activity was only detected in the bread samplein which the higher concentration of Amano 90 was added after baking, beingbelow the limit of detection in all the other samples. However, COTconsidered that the method routinely used to assay enzyme activity inproduction batches of Amano 90 was not sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate 15Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentenzyme inactivation during baking of bread containing the recommended concentration of enzyme. COTrecommended that a more sensitive methodshould be developed, and a limit of detection in bread defined. The improvedassay should then be used in a repeat study, with duplicate analyses. 1.34 COTconsidered that the data submitted were not adequate to demonstrate the validity of the enzyme assay. COTagreed that a better description of the datawould be helpful and this should include data on the linearity of the enzymeassay. 1.35 COTwelcomed the statement of intent to increase routine testing of mycotoxins and antibacterial activity in at least one in four batches but wasunable to recommend full clearance of the enzyme preparation, Amano 90. Enzyme submission - Chymosin 1.36 Chymosin had previously been evaluated by COTand had been granted clearance. The manufacturer had now developed a modified recovery andpurification procedure for this enzyme preparation. 1.37 COTconsidered that additional information was required to confirm the similarity between the product of the modified purification process and theoriginal product. In addition several technical issues relating to the modifiedprocess required further clarification, as did the current specification for theenzyme preparation. The Committee agreed to one year's temporary clearancewhilst this further information was provided. Enzyme submission - Lipase D 1.38 COTconducted a postal consultation of a submission seeking approval of an immobilised enzyme preparation, Lipase D, to be used in manufacture ofyellow fat spreads. The responses were discussed and agreed by the fullCommittee. COTagreed that the level of detail submitted on themanufacturing processes was appropriate and recommended that: the production strain of Rhizopus oryzae should be deposited with a recognised culture collection; the specification for the immobilised enzyme should include limits forheavy metals; 16Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmenttesting for moulds and yeasts should be conducted on every batch and mycotoxins and antibacterial activity should be analysed in at least onein four batches; in the absence of toxicological data on a polymer used in the process,evidence that this polymer is not found in the final inter-esterifiedproduct or products should be provided. 1.39 COTagreed to recommend a two-year temporary clearance for the use of immobilised Lipase D in production of yellow fat spreads, pendingsubmission of the requested analytical data. Enzyme submission - Newlase 1.40 Newlase was granted temporary clearance pending the submission of further data in 1994. Additional data were submitted in 1998 and COTrecommendedfurther temporary clearance, pending the submission of a satisfactory methodfor the detection of the mycotoxin rhizoxin. Data on the detection of rhizoxin,submitted to the COTin 1999, were considered inadequate. The companysubsequently submitted a revised methodology. 1.41 COTconsidered the new methodology would be sufficiently robust to demonstrate the absence of rhizoxin, subject to some additional requirements.These modifications involved the analysis of an appropriate Newlase samplespiked with rhizoxin with each batch and specification of the percentagerecoveries of spiked samples compared to the equivalent concentrationanalysed by direct injection as part of the same analytical run. 1.42 COT agreed to extend the temporary clearance for an additional two years, provided that the recommended amendments to the protocol were adhered toand that batches of Newlase in which rhizoxin was detected should not bemarketed. COTrequested that during this period, the company collate analyticaldata on routine rhizoxin analyses of at least one in every four Newlase batches.These data should be submitted so that the COTcould be assured that themethodology was adequate for routine assay of production batches of Newlase. Fluorine, bromine and iodine 1.43 COTwas informed of the results of analyses of fluorine, bromine, and iodine on samples collected for the 1997 Total Diet Study. COTwas also providedwith estimates of mean population, and mean and high-level adult consumerdietary intakes of fluorine, bromine, and iodine. Dietary intakes for agegroups other than adults had not been estimated. 17Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.44 It was noted that there are no guidelines for fluorine against which to assess estimated dietary intakes. COTwill await the findings of a review of fluorineby the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM) before consideringany potential effects associated with intake of this element. 1.45 COTnoted that since the essentiality of bromide is unclear, the FAO/WHO ADI of 0-1 mg bromide/kg body weight should be considered as a TolerableDaily Intake (TDI) of 1mg bromide/kg body weight. It was agreed that theestimated intakes of bromide were not a cause for concern. 1.46 With regards to dietary intakes of iodine, COTconfirmed that its 1999 advice (See paragraph 1.17 of 1999 Annual Report) still applied ie these intakes ofiodine are unlikely to pose a risk to health. However, it reiterated its previousrecommendation on the need for investigation of the bioavailability of iodinein milk and indicated that it may wish to reconsider its advice in light of theforthcoming findings of the EVM review of iodine. Astatement on this studyis included at the end of this report. Food Standards Agency funded research and surveys 1.47 COTwas informed that most of the current research portfolio within the Food Standard Agency (FSA) is based on research programmes inherited fromMAFF. At the request of the FSABoard, a Research Review Group had beenestablished to review research within the FSAand ensure that the overallresearch strategy and priorities reflect the FSAfuture requirements. TheGroup is expected to hold three meetings and is due to report in the spring of2001. 1.48 The Review Group had set up a Working Party, comprising senior Agency officials and outside independent experts including academics, other researchfunders, consumer groups and industry, to be responsible for the detailedreview. COTwas informed that the Working Party is conducting aconsultation exercise and was invited to contribute. COTrequested andreceived clarification relating to: funds for research on risk management/risk communication; funds for research on animal feedstuffs; the basis for collaboration with MAFF and DH. openness and responsiveness to researchers with suggestions for newareas to be included on research agendas 18Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.49 COTwas not in favour of making long term commitments to specific \"centres of excellence\", which could deter other potential applicants and inhibitdevelopment of new areas of research. However, it was agreed that longerterm funding is needed to attract and retain good research staff. TheCommittee were informed that most research contracts cover a three-yearperiod. 1.50 The issue of quality assurance for research was raised: COTwas informed that there is a need to develop quality assurance criteria for aspects such asensuring management protocols within laboratories and independent appraisalof the quality of the work. 1.51 COTagreed that the design of surveys should take into account the need to interpret human health implications of the data. French Maritime Pine Bark Extracts 1.52 COThad reviewed French Maritime Pine Bark Extract on previous occasions (see paragraph 1.7 of 1998 and paragraph 1.11 of 1999 Annual Reports) andnoted the possibility that the product might contain allergenic proteins. Themanufacturers had submitted new information addressing this issue. 1.53 COTconsidered that elemental analysis for nitrogen was not sufficiently sensitive and could not be used to exclude the possibility that the extractcontained allergenic proteins. The SDS-PAGE analysis was considered to bemore reliable but more information on the method used was needed,particularly in view of the fact that pine bark extract was a complex material.In addition, each analysis should include a concurrent control. Health effects in populations living close to landfill sites 1.54 In 1998, COTcommented on a SAHSU (Small Area Health Statistics Unit) proposal for a study on health effects in populations living close to landfillsites (see paragraphs 1.9 - 1.15 of 1998 Annual Report). The protocol hadbeen revised following identification of all relevant sites, and the Committeewas asked to consider the amended protocol and comment on whether it wasappropriate to proceed with the study. 1.55 The Committee noted that the primary objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that living near a landfill site is associated with an excess risk ofgiving birth to a child with a congenital anomaly or of low birth weight, orwith an excess risk of stillbirth. The secondary objective was to test the 19Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmenthypothesis that living near a landfill site is associated with an excess risk of certain cancers. 1.56 After discussion of aspects of the study design and possible confounding factors, the Committee considered that it was appropriate to proceed with thestudy but urged caution in interpretation of the results. Hexachlorobutadiene 1.57 Hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) is formed as a by-product during the manufacture of chlorinated solvents. COTwas informed of public healthconcerns related to possible prolonged exposure to HCBD in the vicinity of adisused waste dump in a quarry in Cheshire, and was asked to provide adviceon the toxicity of HCDB. 1.58 COTnoted that advice had been sought from some members of the COM, who had reviewed the mutagenicity data on HCBD. They had advised that itwas prudent to assume that HCBD is an in vivo somatic cell mutagen. COT therefore agreed that it was not possible to establish a safe level in relation tocancer or to identify a TDI. Thus, it would be more appropriate to determinemargins of exposure, by comparing the measured air levels with the dosesproducing effects in the toxicology studies. 1.59 On the basis of some conservative approximations, the NOAELfor non- cancer effects of 0.2mg/kg bw/day in animal studies was estimated to beequivalent to continuous inhalation of an air level of 60ppb HCBD. Theeffect level for non-cancer effects estimated to beequivalent to 600ppb HCBD in air and the effect level for tumours of20mg/kg bw/day was equivalent to 6,000ppb HCBD in air. 1.60 COTnoted that there are qualitative similarities between humans and animals in the way that HCBD is distributed and metabolised in the body, andtherefore continuous exposure to a concentration of less than 0.6 ppb HCBDin air (which allows for a 100-fold Margin of Exposure compared to theNOAELequivalent of 60ppb) could be regarded as being without appreciableadverse health effects in respect of non-carcinogenic and reproductive effects. 1.61 This level was approximately 10,000 times lower than the dose that caused cancer in animals following lifetime dietary exposure and therefore COTconsidered that the carcinogenic risk at these low exposure levels wasminimal and was not of appreciable health concern. However, given theuncertainties in the data, the Committee considered that exposure should bereduced to as low a level as reasonably practicable. 20Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.62 The Committee was informed that health studies are being undertaken of exposed individuals. There is also a proposal to develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for HCBD exposure. In addition, theCommittee was informed that a technique is being developed to allowanalysis for HCBD at parts per trillion concentrations in air. The Committeewelcomed this information and considered that the results of these studiesshould inform a further review by the Committee, in due course, of itsconclusions on the health significance of low-level exposures to HCBD. 1.63 The COTstatement is included at the end of this report. Multiple Chemical Sensitivity 1.64 COTlast considered this item in 1999 when it agreed that there was a need to continue monitoring developments in the field so that the issues could bereconsidered when more information became available (see paragraphs 1.25 -1.27, 1999 Annual Report). However, it noted that there were no consistentpatterns of symptoms or exposure data to define the condition, and concludedthat on the basis of knowledge current at the time, there was insufficientevidence to make comments on potential mechanisms or to recommendfurther research in this area. 1.65 COTwas asked to consider a recent report published by the British Society for Allergy, Environmental and Nutritional Medicine (BSAENM) (Eaton et al., J. Nutr. Environ. Med. 10, 39-84, 2000). This reviewed prevalence, possible mechanisms, clinical signs, diagnosis and patient management ofMultiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS). The review had generatedconsiderable public interest and referred to links between MCS and allergy(including food allergy). However it contained little peer-reviewed data. Onenew paper (Kreutzer et al., Am. J. Epidemiology 150, 1-12, 1999) which had not previously been considered by the COT, claimed a high prevalence (6%)of MCS, based on a telephone interview. COTwas asked whether theBSAENM report warranted any change in its 1999 view. 1.66 COTremarked on the limited number of peer reviewed studies cited in the BSAENM report. There was discussion in the report of the need for tests tobe developed to aid diagnosis but there was a major problem regarding theabsence of any clear definition of MCS which was a condition based onpatient-defined criteria with no consistent pattern of symptoms. The term isassociated with a wide range of chemicals and symptoms so diverse that it isnot possible to define mechanisms or formulate studies to consider possiblemechanisms. 21Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.67 COTquestioned the discussion in the BSAENM report of high dose effects of chemicals, such as depletion of nutrients, in considering low dose effects. Thereport also referred to TILT(Toxicant Induced Loss of Tolerance), and type Ballergy, with reference to a collection of unexplained symptoms. COTnotedthat there is no scientific basis for these concepts, and that they are notaccepted by the immunology community. 1.68 The new study of Kreutzer et al(1999) was based on telephone interviews with physician-assisted diagnoses. There was an indication that theparticipants may have been asked leading questions and the approach wasconsidered to lack objectivity and accuracy. Another limitation was an almostcomplete lack of exposure data. 1.69 COTconsidered the case-files in the BSAENM paper. It was pointed out that when individual cases of MCS are investigated they often led to diagnosis ofchemical allergy to a single specific chemical agent. People with allergy toone chemical may be more sensitive to effects of other chemicals. COTtherefore agreed that problems with sensitivity to chemicals can occur butthat these are not necessarily Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. The term\"multiple\" may be applied simply because a specific causal agent has notbeen identified. 1.70 COTalso considered the suggestion that funds should be allocated on a ring- fenced basis for research on MCS. However, it considered that the lack ofevidence for any mechanism of action prevented formulation of a soundresearch programme. 1.71 After careful consideration of the BSAEMN report COTconcluded that there was no basis for modifying the view expressed in 1999. Risk procedures used by the Government's Advisory Committees dealing with food safety 1.72 COTwas informed that, at the Prime Minister's request, Sir Robert May (then Chief Scientific Advisor to the Government) together with the ChiefMedical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson, and the Chairman of the FoodStandards Agency, Sir John Krebs, had carried out a review of risk proceduresin scientific committees that deal with food safety. The review group alsoincluded representatives of the devolved administrations and Dr JimMcQuaid, former Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Chief Scientist andChairman of the Interdepartmental Liaison Group on Risk Assessment(ILGRA). The completed review outlined how the committees approachedrisk analysis and provided recommendations for best practice. 22Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.73 Chairmen of the relevant committees (including the COT) were interviewed and asked to provide information on the committee approaches to riskassessment, information about risk communication, and its role in riskmanagement. 1.74 COTconsidered that it is rigorous in its risk assessment and that the actual approach taken needs to be determined by the specific situation and notdictated by a formal systematic structure. However, a more structuredframework for information gathering (for instance, details of literaturesearches) might help to increase transparency and confidence in the database. 1.75 There was considerable discussion over the issue of providing advice on risk management. It was agreed that, although the COT's primary aim is toprovide advice on risk assessment, occasions can arise when it is necessary toreview the toxicological implications of alternatives for risk managementprocedures. However, a clear distinction was made between technicalassessments of policy options and making judgements on possible politicaltrade-offs. It was noted that, in providing risk assessment advice to policymakers, committees need to clarify the assumptions made and theuncertainties involved in their assessments. Where the COTdid provideviews on possible risk management options these should be carefullydelineated and not weighted by areas outside of Members'expertise. 1.76 COTconsidered that recent measures had greatly increased openness and that very significant moves had been made towards making the findings moreaccessible and transparent. It was agreed that minutes should remainanonymous because of personal security issues. It was stressed that COTreaches a collective decision and therefore unanimity is not an issue. 1.77 It was acknowledged that a degree of communication between expert committees arose mainly from cross membership of advisory committees.Members welcomed a suggestion that, at least on an occasional basis, theyshould meet with their counterparts on other committees. 1.78 Although Members were not usually called upon to discuss Committee conclusions with the media, it was agreed that training in risk communicationwould be helpful. Sucralose 1.79 COTlast discussed sucralose in 1999, when a new teratogenicity study in rabbits was presented. COTconcluded that the \"study was adequate anddemonstrated that sucralose is not a specific developmental toxicant\" and thatthe No-Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for the study was 23Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment350mg/kg bw/day. COTwas content to leave the determination of an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) to the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). 1.80 COTwas informed that the SCF had completed its review and concluded that the effects on the gastrointestinal tract of the dams in the teratogenicity studywere most likely to be attributable to high doses of poorly digestiblesubstances, to which the rabbit is particularly sensitivity. The NOAELidentified by the study was therefore not considered to be relevant to settingthe ADI. ANOAELof 1500 mg/kg bw per day was identified from a numberof dietary and gavage studies. Application of a 100-fold safety factor resultedin an ADI of 0-15 mg/kg bw per day. 1.81 COTnoted and endorsed the SCF opinion and ADI of 0-15 mg/kg bw per day. Terephthalic and isophthalic acids in food 1.82 Terephthalic acid (TA) and isophthalic acid (IA) are starting materials in the manufacture of polyester resins, which are used in coatings on the internalsurface of some metal cans designed to come into contact with food. 1.83 The views of the COTwere sought on the health implications of the results of a survey of TAand IAmigration from can coatings into food. In particular theCOTwas asked to give its views on the possibility that these compoundsmight have endocrine disrupting activity. 1.84 COTwas provided with estimates of intake of IAand TAby infants, toddlers and adults, based upon levels found in canned foods in this survey. 1.85 The toxicology of both TAand IAhad been reviewed by the European Commission's (EC) Scientific Committee for Food (SCF). The SCF had set arestriction (for migration) of for IAand a TDI for TAof 0.125mg/kg bw per day. 1.86 COTconsidered that the available toxicology data were old and not carried out to modern standards. In particular the Committee noted the presence ofurinary bladder stones and associated tumours that developed in a long-termrat study carried out with a concentration of 5% TPAin the diet and requestedthat the views of the COM should be sought on the available in vivo genotoxicity data. 1.87 COTconcluded that the concentrations of TAand IAthat had been determined in foods analysed in the survey were not of concern for publichealth on the basis of available information. However, it was considered that 24Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentthe available toxicity studies were not adequate to exclude the possibility of endocrine disruptor activity, and therefore appropriate studies should beconducted. 1.88 The COTstatement on the survey is included at the end of this report. Working Group on Risk Assessment of Mixtures of Pesticides 1.89 Risk assessment of pesticides has been carried out by measuring residue levels of individual pesticides in food and calculating whether intakes werelikely to exceed the ADI for that pesticide. Usually this has not taken intoaccount concurrent exposure to a number of pesticides via the same route(termed \"cumulative exposure\") or concurrent exposure to one or morepesticides via a different route (termed \"aggregate exposure\"). This has beena source of concern to a number of groups including consumers. Interest inan aggregate approach has been fuelled by the US Food Quality ProtectionAct, which mandates that intakes from all sources including food, drinkingwater and other sources should be considered. It also mandates thattoxicological effects of exposure to more than one pesticide functioning bythe same mechanism of action (eg cholinesterase inhibitors) should beconsidered. In addition, a considerable body of work has been carried out onthe toxicology of mixtures in the US and the assumption is made thatcompounds with the same toxicological action will act in an additive fashionwhereas those with different actions will act independently. 1.90 COTwas informed that the Food Standards Agency considers that \"combined\" risk assessment of pesticides is a priority area. In order toconsider cumulative and aggregate exposures, consideration needs to begiven to the relative toxicity of the compounds, the magnitude of residues andthe amounts of foods consumed. It may also be necessary to consider othersources of these chemicals such as drinking water and veterinary residueswith similar action to the pesticide under consideration, and other means ofexposure, such as occupational and domestic exposure. COTwas asked toconsider establishing a Working Group to review these issues. 1.91 COTagreed to the establishment of the Working Group and approved the terms of reference and membership. The Working Group expects to reportwithin 18 months. 25Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentOngoing work Dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs - Consideration of the TDI 1.92 COT has commenced a review of the recent risk assessments of dioxins carried out by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the EU Scientific Committee onFood (SCF), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA).As part of this review COTwill be reconsidering the tolerable daily intake (TDI).The Committee aims to complete its review of dioxins as soon as possible butaccepted that it would not be complete before mid-2001 at the earliest. Withoutreviewing of the available data independently, COTwas not content to acceptthat the studies selected by the WHO and SCF to inform their tolerable intakeswere the most appropriate for this purpose. 1.93 COTproposed to review the evidence of effects other than cancer, taking into account the information provided by EPA, WHO and SCF. The Committee onCarcinogenicity (COC) was asked to review the evidence of carcinogenicityand the risk assessment procedure adopted by the US-EPA. COTagreed that itwould be valuable to consult additional experts in other specialised areas. Background on the three major assessments being considered by COT. 1.94 In 1998, a consultation of the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (WHO-ECEH) and the International Programme on Chemical Safety(IPCS) recommended a TDI for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the range of 1-4pg WHO-TEQ/kg. The WHO assessment was published in 2000 (van Leeuwenand Younes, Food Additives and Contaminants 17(4) 223-369). The WHO TDI was derived using the NOAEL/LOAELs of what were considered to be the mostsensitive effects in experimental animals, and body burdens associated with theseNOAEL/LOAELs (as opposed to daily intakes) were used to extrapolatebetween species. These body burdens were used in turn to calculate the estimateddaily intake (EDI) considered to result in comparable steady state body burdensin humans. The use of body burdens was assumed to obviate the need for anuncertainty factor to account for species differences in toxicokinetics. TEFs wereused to account for differences in toxicokinetics and potency between dioxin-likecompounds. The consultation decided on an uncertainty factor of 10 to accountboth for interspecies and interindividual differences and the use of LOAELsinstead of NOAELs. COTdid not regard the information presented to besufficient to make a judgement on whether the endpoints used by the WHOconsultation to derive its TDI were the critical adverse effects. 26Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.95 Atask force of the SCF reported its review of the TDI for dioxins in November 2000. It concluded that dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs should beallocated a temporary Tolerable Weekly Intake (t-TWI) of 7 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw. The opinion is available on the SCF website at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scf/outcome_en.html#opinions 1.96 The second draft of the US-EPAreassessment of dioxins was released during 2000. As in its previous (1995) assessment, the US-EPAconsidered thatcancer is the critical endpoint and used low dose linear extrapolation toestimate the risk to humans. The validity of the US-EPAapproach to the risksto health from exposure to of dioxins will be considered in addition to theTDI approach. The US-EPAdraft reassessment is available on the EPAwebsite at http://www.epa.gov/nceawww1/pdfs/dioxin/cd_index.html. Hyperactivity and Food Additives 1.97 COTwas asked to consider the results of a research project entitled \"Do food additives cause hyperactivity and behaviour problems in a geographicallydefined population of three-year-olds?\" Ashort statement was drafted, itsrelease to coincide with release of the study results. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) - Pragmatic guideline limits in food for use in emergencies. 1.98 COTwas asked to consider the appropriateness of setting pragmatic guideline limits for PAHs in food. Guideline limits would be helpful in formulatingadvice on dealing with incidents, such as fires or oil spills, which resulted inPAH contamination of food. In such situations, it may be necessary to makedecisions on possible restriction of harvesting or marketing the affectedfoodstuffs. 1.99 COTnoted that some of the PAHs are generally accepted to be experimental carcinogens and occupational exposure to mixtures of PAHs have been shownto be associated with human cancer. The COC had identified threecompounds as being of greatest concern in respect of carcinogenic hazard onthe basis of in vivomutagenicity and/or multi-site carcinogenicity. These are benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene and dibenz(a,h)anthracene. 27Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.100 The COTwas informed by published data on reported concentrations of individual PAHs that have been detected in various foods, and noted thatsmoking of food and some cooking processes, such as grilling andbarbequing, may result in higher concentrations being detected. 1.101 COTis considering a statement on pragmatic guidelines for PAHs in food for approval and release in 2001. 28Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentStatements of the COT Statement on a Toxicity Study in the Rat of a Hydrogel Filler for Breast Implants Statement on Dietary Exposure to Dioxins and Dioxin-Like PCBsStatement on Dioxins and Dioxin-Like PCBs in Free-Range EggsStatement on the 1997 Total Diet Study - Fluorine, Bromine and Iodine Statement on HexachlorobutadieneStatement on Terephthalic Acid and Isophthalic Acids from Can Coatings 29Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentStatement on a Toxicity Study in the Rat of a Hydrogel Filler for Breast Implants Introduction 1. The Committee was informed that, because of concerns raised by clinicians about the safety of the fillers used in breast implants, the Medical DevicesAgency (MDA) had decided to review the safety data on a hydrogel pre-filledbreast implant manufactured for Poly Implant Prostheses. The MDAhadasked the Committee to consider the report of a study in the rat in which theanimals had received subcutaneous injections of the filler material and hadthen been observed for periods of up to 12 weeks. 1 The implant 2. The filler comprises 92% of physiological saline gelled with 8% of a polysaccharide. It is understood that the polysaccharide is based on a cellulosederivative and forms long, linear chains linked by bridges. This gel iscontained within a silicone elastomer shell. The rat toxicity study 3. The Committee was advised that the only toxicity study of any duration was one in which groups of five rats were injected once subcutaneously on either flankwith the gel filler material or with saline as a control. Groups of dosed andcontrol rats were killed after 3 days, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Limited observationswere made during life and at necropsy. In the groups of rats that were killed at 4and 12 weeks no abnormal clinical signs or differences in body weight werereported for either treated or control animals. However, in the treated animalsresidues of the gel and poorly characterised tissue damage were observed at theinjection site. At these times there were histopathological changes in lymphnodes, livers and, to a lesser extent, the kidneys of the treated animals. 4. The Committee considered that, despite having been carried out in 1996, the study was unsatisfactory in its design, execution and reporting. It was the viewof the Committee that the changes in the lymph nodes represented a real effectand were consistent with a chronic inflammatory response. These changesrequire further study, including investigation of lymph nodes close to anddistant from the site of injection. In addition, there should be investigation ofthe lesions reported in the liver and kidney and of the reversibility of anychanges observed. 30Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusions i) The Committee considered that the conclusion of the study, namely that there were no pathological findings in the organs examined, wasnot supported by the limited experimental results provided, which wereconsidered to be imprecise and inadequate. ii) The Committee agreed that the findings from the study could not be discounted. The Committee was not able to exclude the possibility thatthe reported lesions were indicative of a toxic or immunologically-mediated response. iii) The Committee considered that further testing should be undertaken involving the administration of single doses of the filler gel withlonger-term follow-up and with more detailed reporting compatiblewith current guidelines for chronic toxicity tests.

We have been informed of the results of a study conducted by the former Joint Food Safety and Standards Group of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries andFood and the Department of Health in which Total Diet Study (TDS) samplescollected in 1997 were analysed for the dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and (PCDFs), collectivelyreferred to as dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 1 Tolerable Daily Intake 2. In 1992 we endorsed a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) of 10 picograms/kilogram body weight(10 pg/kg bw) that had been recommended by the World Health Organization(WHO) Regional Office for Europe. We also recommended that whenconsidering mixtures of dioxins the TDI could be regarded as being expressedin Toxic Equivalents of TCDD (TEQs), calculated using internationally agreedToxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs) for dioxin congeners, ie 10 pg TEQ/kg bw. 2 3. In our 1997 review of the health hazards of PCBs, we were unable to set a TDI for total PCBs. However, we considered that the use of TEFs for certaindioxin-like PCB congeners offered a pragmatic approach to assess thepotential toxicity of these dioxin-like PCBs and that they should be consideredin combination with dioxins. 3 4. Recently, we have endorsed the TEFs recommended by a WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (ECEH) consultation for the seventeen2,3,7,8-substituted dioxin congeners and twelve dioxin-like PCB congeners. 4, 5 5. We are aware that a recent WHO International Program for Chemical Safety (IPCS)/ECEH consultation has recommended a TDI range for dioxins anddioxin-like PCBs of 1-4 pg TEQ/kg bw. 6We have not yet had the opportunity to review the data used by the consultation to derive the recentlyrecommended WHO-TDI. We will undertake such a review when a full reportof the consultation is available. In the interim we have considered the resultsof the 1997 TDS survey using both the current UK-TDI and the recentlyrecommended WHO-TDI. 32Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentEstimated dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs 6. We have been provided with estimates of dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs of adults, schoolchildren and toddlers ie children aged 11/2 to 41/2. The same methodology has been used to estimate dietary exposures from the 1997 TDS as was used to estimate exposures for these age groupsfrom the 1982 and 1992 TDS. 1 We note that where concentrations of these compounds in food were below the limit of detection, the concentration hasbeen assumed to be at the limit of detection. It is considered that thisapproach overestimates dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.We have been informed that dietary exposure of adults and schoolchildrenhas been estimated using food consumption data for these specific groups. 7, 8 7. While food consumption data for toddlers do exist,9 due to a current limitation in the methodology used to estimate exposures, the consumption of 'toddler-specific'foods cannot yet be determined. As a result, toddler food consumptiondata were not used directly to estimate toddler dietary exposures from previousTotal Diet Studies. 10 Toddler dietary exposure has been estimated previously by scaling the estimated dietary exposure of adults by the relative energy contentsof adult and toddler diet. The energy content of the latter was calculated fromthe toddler food consumption data. 9 For comparative purposes, this approach has also been used to estimate dietary exposure of toddlers from the 1997TDS. 1 However, toddler exposures have now also been estimated from the 1997 TDS (and retrospectively from the 1982 and 1992 TDS for comparativepurposes) directly using toddler food consumption data. We note that thisapproach does not take into account exposures resulting from the consumptionof 'toddler-specific'foods but we consider that it provides a more robustestimate of toddlers'dietary exposure than the earlier approach. However, werecommend that the methodology is revised as soon as possible so as to takeaccount of consumption of 'toddler-specific'foods and we ask to see theserevised exposure estimates at the earliest opportunity. 8. Dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, estimated from the 1982, 1992, and 1997 Total Diet Studies, for average and high-level (97.5thpercentile) adult, schoolchild, and toddler consumers (using both approaches)are presented in the Table. The Table presents toddler dietary exposuresestimated from toddler food consumption data and also presents exposuresestimated by scaling adult consumption patterns by the energy content of thetoddler diet. Dietary exposures estimated using toddler food consumptiondata are higher than when estimated by scaling adult consumption patterns bythe energy content of the toddler diet. Exposures estimated from the 1982 and1992 TDS have been recalculated using the new WHO-TEFs so that the dataare comparable to dietary exposures estimated from the 1997 TDS. 33Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment9. The estimated dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs for both average and high-level consumers from the three age groups are at or withinthe current UK-TDI of 10 pg TEQ/kg bw. Furthermore, the estimatedaverage and high level dietary exposures for adult and schoolchild consumersare also below the upper value of the recently recommended WHO-TDI of 1-4 pg TEQ/kg bw. However, the estimated dietary exposures for toddlers whoare average consumers are at or slightly above the upper value of this TDI.The upper value of this TDI is exceeded approximately two-fold by alltoddlers who are high-level consumers. 10. The estimated dietary exposures to dioxin-like compounds, on a total TEQ basis, for all three age groups show a continuing downward trend, albeit lesssteeply compared with the decline between 1982 and 1992. However, thedietary exposures to dioxin-like PCBs estimated from the 1997 TDS are verysimilar to those estimated from the 1992 TDS. 34Annual report 2000 Year 1982 1992 1997 Consumertype Average High-level Average High-level Average High-levelAge-group Adults 7.2 13 2.5 4.3 1.8 3.1 Schoolchildren 8.6 15 3.0 4.7 2.2 3.5 Toddlers (estimated using toddler food consumption data) 1 1/2to 21/2 23 49 7.5 14 5. 1 1 0 21/2to 31/2 19 41 6.3 11 4.4 8.4 31/2to 41/2(boys) 17 33 5.6 9.2 4.0 6.9 31/2to 41/2(girls) 17 34 5.6 9.6 4.0 7.2 Toddlers (estimated by scaling adult consumption patterns by the energy content of the toddler diet) 11/2to 21/2 18 28 6.3 9.8 4.6 7.2 21/2to 31/2 17 25 5.8 8.6 4.2 6.3 31/2to 41/2(boys) 16 23 5.7 8.0 4.1 5.8 31/2to 41/2(girls) 15 23 5.3 8.0 3.9 5.8 Table: Estimated dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCB from TDS samples (pg TEQ/kg bw per day)11. We have seen data which indicate that the decline in dietary exposure is real and not attributable to changes in analytical sensitivity or number of foodgroups analysed in different Total Diet Studies. This decline in dietaryexposure is primarily due to either a reduction in emissions to theenvironment or a change in food consumption patterns, or both. Environmental controls 12. Abatement measures have been taken to control the emission of dioxins to the environment and hence foods. In particular the imposition of strict emissionlimits on municipal waste incinerators have reduced emissions from thissector by an estimated 90%. The UK is introducing Regulations to give effectto EC Directive 96/59, which requires the phasing out and disposal ofremaining identifiable PCBs. The Regulations follow on from consultationlast year, and the publication of the UK action plan in 1997. 11 It is anticipated that as a result of these measures dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-likePCBs will continue to decline gradually. We understand that the Governmentis in the process of producing an UK position paper on dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, which will assess the effectiveness of current and future abatementmeasures. Recommendations 13. We are reassured by the evidence of a continuing decline in dietary exposure to dioxin-like compounds. We welcome the evidence that average and high-level adult and schoolchild consumers do not exceed the current UK-TDI orthe upper value of the recently recommended WHO-TDI. 14. We notethat estimated dietary exposures of toddlers do not exceed the current UK-TDI but that approximately 50% of toddlers will exceed theupper value of the newly recommended WHO-TDI. However, we notethat there are limitations in the methodology used to derive these estimatedexposures for toddlers, which means that such estimates should be viewedwith caution. We recommend that robust characterisation and estimates of toddler exposure, taking into account consumption of 'toddler-specific'foods,are carried out and we request that we see such information at the earliestopportunity. 15. We notethat the WHO-IPCS/ECEH consultation recommended that continued efforts should be made to reduce exposure towards the lower endof the newly recommended WHO-TDI range. We will undertake a review ofthe WHO-TDI when a full report of the consultation is available and we willpay particular attention to the relevance of the WHO-TDI to toddlers. 35Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment16. We recommend that dietary exposure to dioxin-like compounds should continue to be monitored at regular intervals to confirm that the overalldownward trend in exposure continues as a result of current and futureabatement measures. 17. The available data indicate that some 50% of toddlers in the UK will exceed the upper value of the WHO-TDI but not the current UK-TDI. However, wedo not consider that this exceedence necessarily poses a health risk and, inadvance of a detailed review of the WHO-TDI, we do not recommend anyintervention with respect to the diets of toddlers. This interim position isbased upon the following considerations: i) it is not yet clear to what extent the WHO-TDI is particularly relevant for toddlers; ii) evidence that some toddlers may exceed the WHO-TDI is based upon estimations of dietary exposure that need to be treated with somecaution; and iii) there is a continuing decline in the overall exposure to dioxin-like compounds. Conclusions 18. Estimated exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs for adults, schoolchildren, and toddlers are all at or below the current UK-TDI.Estimated exposures for adults and schoolchildren are also below the uppervalue of the newly recommended WHO-TDI, although toddlers may exceedthis value. However, estimated exposures for all age groups havesubstantially declined since 1982 and we anticipate that exposures willcontinue to decline in the future due to the environmental controls already inplace and those planned. We conclude that the current concentrations ofdioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food are unlikely to pose a risk to health.

We have been informed of the results of a study conducted by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in which free-range hen and duck eggs wereanalysed for the presence of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) collectively referred to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 1 Survey design 2. Atotal of 45 free-range hen and duck egg samples, each sample consisting of six individual eggs, were collected from farms or private houses in Kent,Essex, Norfolk, and Buckinghamshire between November 1994 and April1996. We have been informed that the purpose of this exercise was toexamine the use of free-range eggs as indicators of environmentalcontamination, rather than to estimate dietary exposure to these compoundsthrough the consumption of free-range eggs. The sampling sites were selectedfor practical convenience rather than on the basis of concerns about localcontamination. We note that these free-range egg samples may not berepresentative of those on sale throughout the United Kingdom. Concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs 3. Concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the combined yolk and white of hen eggs were in the range of 1.1-22 (mean 6.3, median 3.5) ngToxic Equivalents (TEQ)/kg fat. In the combined yolk and white of duck eggsconcentrations were in the range of 1.9-49 (mean 12, median 5.2) ng TEQ/kgfat. We note that in both cases the distribution of values appeared to beskewed. We have been informed that there were no obvious major pointsources of contamination in the immediate vicinity of these sampling sites toaccount for the higher values. We have been told that the most likely sourceof contamination of free-range eggs by these compounds is via the ingestionof soil and sediment by hens and ducks as they forage for food. However,environmental sampling at the sites of egg collection was not undertaken. 38Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentEstimated dietary exposures 4. We have been provided with estimated dietary exposures for toddlers, schoolchildren, and adults to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs based on theconcentrations of these compounds in free-range eggs in this survey. However,we consider that, because these free-range eggs may not be representative ofthose on sale throughout the UK, the data from this survey cannot be used toestimate dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs with anyconfidence from these sources. Nor can the data from this survey be used todraw any comparisons between free-range eggs and other hen and duck eggs,for which there are few data available. Conclusions 5. We consider that this survey of dioxins and dioxin-like PCB in free-range hen and duck eggs cannot be used to estimate the risk to health of consumers ofsuch eggs in the UK. 6. The concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in free-range hen and duck eggs might be used as an indicator of environmental contamination. Alarger, more rigorously designed study would be needed to investigate this. July 2000 COTstatement 2000/06 References 1 Food Standards Agency (2000). Dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in free-range eggs. Summary Report, located on the FSAwebsite at: http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk/maff/archive/food/infsheet/1997/no105/table2.htm 39Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentStatement on the 1997 Total Diet Study - Fluorine, Bromine, and Iodine Introduction 1. We have been informed of the results of a study conducted by the Food Standards Agency in which Total Diet Study (TDS) samples collected in 1997were analysed for the presence of three halogen elements, namely fluorine,bromine, and iodine. 1 Estimated dietary intakes 2. We have been provided with estimates of mean population, and mean and high-level (97.5th percentile) adult consumer dietary intakes of fluorine,bromine, and iodine. Mean population intakes are based on household, ratherthan individual, consumption data that are updated yearly and thus can be usedto follow trends in dietary intakes. Mean and high-level consumer intakes arebased on adult consumption data from the 1986/87 National Diet andNutrition Survey of British Adults. 2 We note that dietary intakes for age groups other than adults have not been estimated. 3. We note that the analytical techniques used to determine the concentrations of fluorine, bromine, and iodine in the TDS samples did not distinguish betweenthe different chemical forms in which these elements may exist in food. Fluorine 4. The mean population dietary intake of fluorine estimated from the 1997 TDS is 1.2 mg/person per day. Estimated dietary intakes for mean and high-level adultconsumers are 0.94 and 2.0 mg/person per day respectively. Dietary intakes forfluorine were last estimated in 1984 when the mean population intake,calculated from concentrations of fluorine determined in selected food samplesfrom the 1978, 1979, and 1980 total diet studies, was estimated as 1.8mg/person per day. 3 However, due to changes in the TDS design since 1981 and the limited number of samples that were used to estimate this intake in1984, a direct comparison between the 1997 TDS mean population intakeestimate and this earlier estimate cannot be made. There are no guidelines forfluorine against which to assess these estimated dietary intakes. However, wehave been informed that the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM)will be considering fluorine in due course and we will await the findings of thatbody before considering any potential effects associated with these intakes. 40Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentBromine 5. We have not previously considered dietary intakes of bromine. The mean population dietary intake of bromine estimated from the 1997 TDS is 3.6mg/person per day. Estimated dietary intakes for mean and high-level adultconsumers are 3.8 and 6.2 mg/person per day. We have had the opportunity toreview an evaluation of bromine by the Joint Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Meeting onPesticide Residues (JMPR), which established an Acceptable Daily Intake(ADI) range of 0-1 mg/kg body weight. 4 It is not certain whether bromine is essential5so we consider it inappropriate to recommend a range for intakes of bromine that includes zero. However, we consider that the upper value of thisrange represents a bromine intake below which intakes are unlikely to pose arisk to health. In this respect the upper value of 1 mg bromine/kg body weightper day, equivalent to 60 mg/day for a 60 kg individual, can be considered tobe a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI). Estimated mean and high-level adultconsumer dietary intakes of bromine are within this guideline and aretherefore not a cause for concern. Iodine 6. We have considered dietary intakes of iodine on a number of previous occasions, most recently earlier this year when we considered a survey ofiodine in cows'milk. 6We concluded that the concentrations of iodine in cows'milk were unlikely to pose a risk to health,7despite calculations that suggested that dietary intakes of iodine by some toddlers may exceed theProvisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (PMTDI) for iodine of 0.017milligrams per kilogram body weight (17 (g/kg body weight) asrecommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives(JECFA). 8Dietary intakes for mean and high-level adult consumers estimated from the 1997 TDS of 240 and 420 (g/person per day are within the JECFAPMTDI, which is equivalent to 1000 (g/day for a 60 kg individual, and aretherefore not a cause for concern. While dietary intakes for children aged 1 1/2 to 41/2have not been calculated from the 1997 TDS, we have been informed that intakes for this age group are likely to be comparable to the intakes weconsidered in relation to the survey of iodine in cows'milk. There is no newinformation that would lead us to alter our previous advice 7that estimated dietary intakes of iodine by toddlers are unlikely to pose a risk to health.However, we have been informed that the EVM are in the process ofconsidering iodine and thus we may wish to reconsider these results in thelight of the findings of that body. 41Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusion 7. We conclude that the estimated total dietary intakes of bromine and iodine based on data from the 1997 Total Diet Study are unlikely to pose a risk tohealth. However, further information on the different chemical forms of theseelements in the diet would assist in risk assessment. We will await thefindings of a review of fluorine by the Expert Group on Vitamin and Mineralsbefore considering any potential effects associated with the intakes of thiselement.

The fully chlorinated hydrocarbon hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD, C4Cl6) is formed as a by-product during the manufacture of chlorinated solvents. 2. Environmental contamination with HCBD has recently been detected around a disused waste dump in a quarry at Weston in Runcorn, Cheshire. This wasused by ICI for about 50 years until the early 1970s. The release of HCBDinto the underlying strata and groundwater came to light as a result of aproject carried out by ICI to investigate the environmental impact of itsprevious industrial and waste disposal activities. HCBD has been detected inthe indoor air of properties close to the site. 3. We have been informed that there are 128 houses built close to the former dump which have been investigated and HCBD has been detected recently in theindoor air of 21 of these, at concentrations of under 10 parts per billion (ppb) inall houses apart from one, where a concentration of 1000 ppb was detected. Thecurrent limit of detection is 2 ppb in air. People living in most of the houseswhere HCBD has been detected have been moved to other accommodation.North Cheshire Health Authority has offered health checks to those residentswho were, at the time, living in houses where HCBD was detected. 4. In view of public health concerns, the Committee has been asked by the Department of Health to provide advice on the toxicity of HCBD. This isgiven below. Toxicology of HCBD 5. There is very little information on the toxicological effects of HCBD derived from studies on humans. Consequently, an assessment of the possible risks tohuman health has to be based on laboratory and animal data. However, mostanimal toxicity studies on HCBD have been conducted using oral exposureand there are few studies of exposure by inhalation, the prime route ofexposure for residents at Weston. 6. The results of studies of repeated oral administration indicate that HCBD can cause damage to the kidneys at doses of 0.5 milligrams/kilogram body weightper day (mg/kg bw per day) and above in female mice 1and at doses of 2 mg/kg bw per day and above in both sexes of rats.2Damage to other tissues (liver, nervous system) has been reported at a higher dose of 20 mg/kg bw per 44Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentday in rats.2In reproduction studies at this dose foetal toxicity, predominantly manifested as retardation of foetal growth, was also recorded in rats.3 However, these effects were attributed to maternal toxicity because adversedevelopmental effects were not induced at doses that were not toxic to thedam. Limited information from the animal studies indicates that exposure byinhalation results in the same toxic effects, with the kidney being the primetarget organ. 7. Thresholds for each of these adverse effects have been demonstrated in several studies. The Committee considered that the response in the kidneys of mice isthe most sensitive indicator of the toxicity of HCBD but that the response ofone female mouse dosed with 0.2 mg/kg bw per day for 13 weeks 1was not sufficient evidence to warrant the use of a lower figure for a No ObservedAdverse Effect Level (NOAEL). Therefore, the Committee considered that, fornon-carcinogenic effects, the NOAELis 0.2 mg/kg bw per day. 4,5 8. Members of our sister committee, the Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COM) have reviewed themutagenicity of HCBD. There are in vitrodata, mainly from studies using Salmonella TA100, that indicate that HCBD has mutagenic potential. 6,7 Negative results have been reported from in vivoassays in bone marrow 8,9but these were inadequate to draw definite conclusions. COM members consideredthat further in vivostudies were needed, particularly in the kidney, before any definite conclusions could be drawn. On the data currently available it would beprudent to assume that HCBD is an in vivosomatic cell mutagen. 9. Acarcinogenic response has been seen in the kidneys of rats in a study in which HCBD was administered continually in the diet for two years at a doseof 20 mg/kg bw per day (the highest dose tested). No tumours were observedin the kidneys of male or female rats administered doses of 2 mg/kg bw perday or lower. 2 10. In view of the advice from the COM that HCBD should be regarded as an in vivomutagen the COTwere unable to establish a safe level in relation to cancer or to identify a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for HCBD. Conclusions 11. From animal studies, the Committee agreed that a NOAELof 0.2 mg/kg bw per day had been established for the non-carcinogenic effects of HCBD. 12. The Committee considered that, in order to estimate the concentration in air that would result in humans inhaling a dose of 0.2 mg/kg bw per day, it wasnecessary to make the following assumptions: 45Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentthe toxicity of HCBD following inhalation exposure is essentially the same, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as the toxicity of HCBDfollowing oral exposure; there are no significant differences in the extent of absorption of HCBDby either route; and a 60 kg adult would inhale 20 cubic metres (m3) of air per day. On this basis the Committee considered that, as an approximation, a dose of 0.2 mg/kg bw per day would correspond to the continuous inhalation of aircontaining 0.6 mg/m 3of HCBD, equivalent to an air concentration of about 60 ppb. 13. In view of the evidence that there are qualitative similarities between humans and animals in the way that HCBD is distributed and metabolised in the body,the Committee considered that continuous exposure to a concentration ofHCBD in air of less than 0.6 ppb (ie the Margin of Exposure below 60 ppb isat least 100) can be regarded as being without appreciable adverse healtheffects in respect of non-carcinogenic and reproductive effects. 14. In respect of concerns about a potential carcinogenic effect, the Committee noted that exposures to less than 0.6 ppb HCBD were 10,000 times lower thanthe equivalent dose of HCBD which, when fed daily throughout a lifetime torats, had resulted in kidney tumours. The Committee considered therefore thatthe carcinogenic risk at these low exposure levels was minimal and was not ofappreciable health concern. However, given the uncertainties in the data, theCommittee considered that exposure should be reduced to as low a level asreasonably practicable (ALARP). 15. The Committee was informed that health studies are being undertaken of exposed residents of Weston 10and members of the ICI workforce.11There is also a proposal to develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model forHCBD exposure. 11In addition, the Committee was informed that a technique is being developed to allow analysis for HCBD at parts per trillionconcentrations in air. The Committee welcomed this information andconsidered that the results of these studies should inform a further review bythe Committee, in due course, of its conclusions on the health significance oflow-level exposures to HCBD.

The views of the Committee were sought on the health implications of the results of a survey1of terephthalic acid (TA) and isophthalic acid (IA) migration from can coatings into food. In particular the Committee was askedto give its views on the possibility that these compounds might haveendocrine disruptor activity. Background 2. TAand IA(see Figure) are starting materials in the manufacture of polyester resins, which are used in coatings on the internal surface of some metal cansdesigned to come into contact with food. Figure 1 Terephthalic acid (TA) Isophthalic acid (IA) 3. As part of the Food Standards Agency's continuing programme of surveillance on the migration of chemicals from food contact materials a two-part survey for TAand IAwas carried out. In the first phase of the surveyvarious canned foods were purchased and the cans were tested for thepresence of coatings made from polyester resins. In the second phase, furthersamples of the products in those cans which had polyester coatings wereanalysed to determine whether migration of TAand IAinto the can contentshad occurred. 1 48Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentTerephthalic acid (TA) Isophthalic acid (IA) COOH COOH COOHCOOHSurvey results 4. Twenty-eight products were identified as being in cans coated with polyester resin on all, or part, of their internal surfaces. In samples of the contents ofthese cans, TAwas found in 3 of 28 samples at or just above the limit ofquantification *and in 7 samples at levels between the limit of detectionand limit of quantification. IAwas detected in 4 of 28 samples at levels betweenthe limit of detection and limit of quantification. 5. Estimates were made of the potential intakes of TAand IAfrom canned foods studied in the second phase of the survey. Intakes were estimated for differentage groups according to the types of foods in which these substances werefound. The estimates used the analytical results for samples in which TAand/or IAwere found. Intakes were calculated by summing the intakes of97.5th percentile consumers for each food in which the given substance was detected, giving greatest weight in this summation to the two highestestimates of intake. The intake estimate was divided by bodyweight to derivecontaminant exposure in milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight (mg/kg bw)per day, bodyweights used were: 8.8 kg for infants, 14.5 kg for toddlers (1 1/2- 41/2years old) and 60 kg for adults. 6. The potential intake of TAby infants between 6 and 12 months old who were 97.5th percentile consumers was estimated as 0.0074 mg/kg bw per day. Fortoddlers who were 97.5th potential intake of TAwasestimated as 0.083 mg/kg bw per day. For adults who were 97.5th percentileconsumers the potential intake of TAwas estimated as 0.0025 perday. 7. The intake consumers was estimated as 0.0013 mg/kg bw per day. There are no estimates of intake by infants as noIAwas detected in baby foods. 49Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment* Limit of quantification: the lowest level at which the amount of a substance can be stated with confidence. Limit of detection: the lowest level at which a substance can be detected with confidence. 97.5th percentile consumers are those whose consumption of a specific food or group of foodstuffs corresponds to the 97.5th percentile point on a distribution curve for consumption of the given food orfoods.Toxicology of TA and IA 8. The European Commission's Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) reviewed studies of the toxicity and migration of both TAand IA. 9. In view of the availability of data from long-term studies the SCF was able, pending submission of full reports, to set a temporary Tolerable Daily Intake(TDI) for TAof 0.125 mg/kg bw, which was based on 3-month and 2-yeardietary studies in rats. 2The major finding in the long-term study with TAwas the occurrence of malignant and benign tumours of the urinary tract at highdoses. 3,4These were documented as being associated with the formation of stones in the urinary bladder which represents a potential non-genotoxicmechanism for the formation of such tumours. 10. On the basis of the available data from migration and toxicity studies submitted by industry the SCF has also set a restriction (for migration fromplastics) of 5 mg/kg food for IA. 2This limit was based on negative genotoxicity data and a 90-day dietary study in rats, from which a NoObserved Effect Level of 250 mg/kg bw per day was established. 11. The manufacturers of TAand IAsubmitted a commentary on the available reproductive and developmental toxicity data for both compounds. In this itwas proposed that the weight of the evidence from these studies does notsupport a role for these acids in modulating the endocrine system. 5 12. The Committee noted that the toxicity studies on TAand IAwere not carried out to modern standards. It was recognised that the limited nature of thepublished work would not allow them to address fully the questions that theyhad been asked. 13. It was requested that, in the light of the urinary tumours occurring in rats fed the highest dietary concentration of TA, the view of the Committee onMutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentbe sought on the potential in vivogenotoxicity of this compound. 14. It was noted that the estimated intakes of TAby infants, toddlers and adults who were 97.5th percentile consumers were below the temporary TDIestablished by the SCF. In addition, it was noted that the concentrations of IAfound in samples of canned food in the survey were below the migration limitset by that committee. 50Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusions i) The Committee concluded that the concentrations of TAand IAthat had been determined in foods analysed in the survey were not of concern for publichealth on the basis of available information. ii) The Committee notedthe commentary of the manufacturers on possible endocrine disruptor activity of TAor IA. However, it was considered that thetoxicity studies were inadequate to exclude this possibility. It was thereforerecommended that appropriate studies should be carried out to determine whether TAor IApossess endocrine disruptor activity. September 2000 COTStatement 2000/08 References 1.

Such requests generally relate to chemicals for which there areincomplete, non-standard or controversial data sets for which the expertise of theindependent committee members is required to provide recommendations onpotential hazards and risks and frequently suggestions for further studies. During 2000, advice was provided on a diverse range of chemicals including food packaging contaminants, industrial chemicals and alcoholic beverages. Amongstthe most complex evaluations of mutagenic potential are estimates of howconclusions may be extrapolated from in vitro to in vivotests, and from somatic to germ cells. As part of an ongoing development of expertise in such extrapolations,the committee published statements on data extrapolation from somatic to germcells for chemicals which disturb the fidelity of chromosome segregation whichmay thus induce aneuploidy. The year 2000 saw the completion of a major committee project; the preparation of a guidance document on a strategy for the testing of chemicals for mutagenicity.This document provides guidance on both test method selection and theirappropriate use in the assessment of the potential mutagenic activity of chemicals.The updated guidance provides advice on the application of a range of methods(such as the use of transgenic animals) that have been developed over the past 10years and highlighted the importance of measuring the potential of aneuploidyinduction by chemicals in mutagenic screening programmes. The development ofthe guidance document involved extensive discussions and meetings with a widerange of interested parties, including the Industrial Genotoxicology Group, the UKand the European Environmental Mutagen Societies. The completed guidancedocument is being widely distributed and current indications are that the strategyrecommended will have a major influence on future European policy on chemicaltesting. Professor James M Parry (Chairman) BSc PhD DSc 59Annual report 2000 Hydroquinone and phenol 2.1 At the request of HSE the Committee had provided advice on the interpretation of mutagenicity data on hydroquinone and phenol in 1994 and1995. The COM had agreed that both hydroquinone and phenol should beregarded as somatic cell in-vivomutagens. The Committee had been persuaded for these two compounds that by the oral route there was apotential for a threshold of activity. This conclusion was based on goodevidence of protective mechanisms (namely rapid conjugation anddetoxification via the glutathione pathway) that would substantially reducesystemic exposure to any active metabolites formed. However, membersagreed that there was insufficient data regarding activity following inhalationand dermal exposures and it was not possible to assume a threshold existedfor mutagenic activity when exposure was via the respiratory tract or via theskin. The Committee reviewed some additional data provided by industry in1995 on the metabolism of hydroquinone and phenol in animals and humans.These data were useful but did not allow for an assessment of pre-systemicmetabolism following either inhalation or dermal exposure. The Committeerecommended that further studies were required which should include earlysampling for free and conjugated hydroquinone or phenol in blood followingadministration of test substances to rats or dogs via a bronchoscope. 2.2 In 1999, further published data was provided to the Committee on the kinetics of hydroquinone metabolism in rats following intratracheal instillation and itspercutaneous absorption, together with some in-vitrostudies using rat skin and human stratum corneum. Anumber of additional in-vivomutagenicity studies including an investigation of site of contact mutagenicity in skin andrespiratory tract of Muta TM mice using the LacZ transgene were also considered. The Committee considered these new data during 1999 andagreed a statement which was published on the COM Website in January2000. 2.3 In summary the new toxicokinetic study involved giving rats a single intra- tracheal dose of 14C-hydroquinone. Free hydroquinone in arterial blood was detected 5-10 seconds after dosing. This suggested a potential hazard of site-of- contact and systemic mutagenic effects following exposure by inhalationto hydroquinone. The Committee thus reaffirmed its previous conclusions onhydroquinone (and phenol) which are given in full in the statement at the endof this report. 60Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment3-Monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) 2.4 3-Monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) is a member of a group of chemicals present as contaminants known as chloropropanols. 3-MCPD canbe present as a contaminant in epichlorhydrin/amine copolymers or coagulant aids in water treatment. These polyamine flocculantshave been available for many years as approved products for use in watertreatment and thus 3-MCPD may be present in drinking water arising fromtheir use. The Committee was aware that 3-MCPD had been detected as acontaminant of several foods and food ingredients, including acid hydrolysedvegetable protein (acid-HVP). The COC was asked to evaluate and advise onthe carcinogenicity of 3-MCPD by the Committee on Chemicals andMaterials of Construction for use in Public Water Supply and SwimmingPools (CCM), a statutory committee which provides advice to the Secretaryof State for the Environment, Transport and Regions on the approval ofchemical substances in contact with public water supplies. 2.5 The COM had reviewed the available mutagenicity data on 3-MCPD in 1999 which suggested that 3-MCPD had mutagenic activity in-vitro. The Committee agreed that further negative results in an in-vivomutagenicity test in a second tissue namely rat liver UDS were required in order to provideadequate reassurance that the activity seen in-vitrois not expressed in vivo. The Committee considered at its October 2000 meeting two new in vivo mutagenicity studies commissioned by the UK Drinking Water Inspectorate.These comprised a rat bone-marrow micronucleus test and a rat liver UDSassay, both of which are widely used to assess genotoxicity in-vivo. 2.6 The Committee concluded that both the rat bone-marrow micronucleus test and the rat liver UDS test had been carried out to acceptable standards andwere negative. Thus, the additional information recommended by the COM asbeing necessary to provide adequate reassurance that the mutagenic activityseen in-vitrowas not expressed in-vivohad now been provided. The Committee agreed that \u00df-chlorolactic acid was the major urinary metabolitein rats formed by the oxidation of 3-MCPD and that the two newmutagenicity studies supported the view that reactive metabolites if formeddid not produce genotoxicity in-vivoin the tissues assessed. 2.7 The Committee concluded that 3-MCPD can be regarded as having no significant genotoxic potential in-vivo. Acopy of the revised COM statement on 3-MCPD can be found at the end of this report. 61Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentMutagenicity of ethanol, acetaldehyde and alcoholic beverages 2.8 In 1995 the COM gave detailed consideration to the potential mutagenicity of ethanol, acetaldehyde and alcoholic beverages. This was to provide input tothe Interdepartmental Working Group reviewing current advice on this topic.The Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC) also carried out a detailed reviewof the available data, mainly from epidemiology studies, on thecarcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages. The advice from these Committeeswas considered by the Interdepartmental Working Group when drawing uptheir Report on Sensible Drinking published in December 1995. The mainconclusions reached by COC and COM at that time were: i) The COM agreed that the consumption of alcoholic beverages does not present any significant concern with respect to their mutagenicpotential. ii) The COC concluded that the epidemiological evidence supported the view that drinking alcohol causes a dose-related increase in the risk ofsquamous carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract as a whole, andfor cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and oesophagus. 2.9 The COM was asked to update its statement on the mutagenicity of ethanol, acetaldehyde and alcoholic beverages by the COC in order to provideadditional information as part of a review of the evidence on the associationbetween drinking alcohol and breast cancer. 2.10 The Committee reaffirmed its 1995 conclusion that consumption of alcoholic beverages does not present any significant concern with respect to theirmutagenic potential. Acopy of the statement published on the COM Websitecan be found at the end of this report. Di-isopropylnaphthalene(s) in food packaging made from recycled paper and board: Conclusion on mutagenicity studies using the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) 2.11 The Committee was asked by the COTto provide advice on the conduct and interpretation of in-vitromutagenicity tests with di-isopropylnaphthalenes using the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA). The COM reviewed two separatetests, one at its May 1999 meeting and a further test at its February 2000meeting. The COM concluded that the results of the two mouse lymphoma 62Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentassays were similar. The evidence suggested equivocal mutagenicity in the mouse lymphoma assay, therefore no conclusion based on the MLAstudiescould be drawn. Amore detailed summary of the results from these two testshas been published on the COM Website. 2.12 However, the Committee noted that di-isopropylnaphthalene(s) contained no chemical groups which would be structurally alerting for potentialmutagenicity. In addition there was no evidence for a mutagenic effect inother in-vitromutagenicity tests or in an adequately performed in-vivo micronucleus assay in mice. The Committee agreed that no furthermutagenicity testing was required. Testing strategies and evaluation 2.13 The Committee completed a major piece of work during this year, namely the revision of its guidelines on an appropriate strategy for the testing ofchemicals for mutagenicity. This involved contributions from membersduring 1999 whose terms of appointment ended in April 2000 and then frommembers of the new committee. The Committee's deliberations concentratedon the strategy itself, and members did not undertake any updating of theother aspects covered in the earlier guidelines. Adraft document was issuedfor public consultation in March 2000. This was discussed at a meeting ofthe UKEMS's Industrial Genotoxicity Group in May 2000. It was agreed thatthe final document should be referred to as \"Guidance on a strategy fortesting of chemicals for mutagenicity\" to emphasise the advisory nature ofthese recommendations. 2.14 The Committee also provided advice to the Advisory Committee on Pesticides on the evaluation of chemically induced aneuploidy and inparticular the extrapolation of data from somatic cells to germ cells. Thislatter piece of work involved a detailed consideration of the conclusionsreached by the European Commission's Group of Specialised Experts whowere considering the classification and labelling of benomyl, carbendazimand thiophanate-methyl under the Dangerous Substances Directive67/548/EEC. Areport outlining the Committee's consideration of each ofthese items is given below and the statement by the Committee on theextrapolation of data on chemical induced aneuploidy is given at the end ofthis report. 63Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentGuidance on a strategy for testing of chemicals for mutagenicity. 2.15 The COM first published guidelines for testing of chemicals for mutagenicity in 1981. These provided guidance to the relevant governmentdepartments/agencies on the state of the art approach to testing at that time.The need for these to be periodically updated, to reflect advances indevelopment and validation of methods, was recognised and revisedguidelines were published in 1989. The new guidance which has beenpublished as a separate document and on the COM Website continues thisupdating process. The strategy outlined is believed to be the most appropriatewith regard to available methods and recognising the need to avoid the use oflive animals where practical and validated alternative methods whereavailable. It is recognised that, as with earlier guidelines, it will be some timebefore this strategy is reflected in the mandatory, regulatory guidelines of thevarious agencies, and it is not intended for this guidance to be appliedretrospectively. The Committee believes that the approach outlined willremain valid for several years and will encourage steps to obtain internationalrecognition of the newer tests being recommended for which there are,currently, no international harmonised guidelines. 2.16 An outline of the overall strategy in the revised guidance is given below. It is not possible to adequately cover all of the issues covered in the revisedguidance document and the reader is encouraged to obtain a copy from thesecretariat or to view the document on the COM Website. 2.17 The strategy being recommended, as in the Committee's earlier guidance, is based on three progressive stages. 2.18 Stage 1 (initial screening) is based on in-vitrotests. For most chemicals three tests are recommended, but for those where little or no human exposure isexpected (eg industrial intermediates, some low production volume industrialchemicals) two tests may be appropriate, namely a bacterial assay for genemutation and an in-vitromammalian cell assay for clastogenicity and aneugenicity. The Committee believes that screening for both clastogenicityand aneugenicity is now possible in the initial (Stage 1) tests. The second testmay be metaphase analysis, with consideration of hyperdiploidy, polyploidyand effects on mitotic indices as indicators of possible aneugenicity; if thesesuggest potential aneugenicity this needs to be confirmed by use ofappropriate staining procedures, such as FISH and chromosome painting.Alternatively an in-vitromicronucleus test may be used. If a positive result is obtained, kinetochore or centromeric staining should be employed toascertain the nature of the micronuclei induced (ie whether induction is due toclastogenicity or aneugenicity). The third recommended assay is an 64Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentadditional gene mutation assay in mammalian cells, the mouse lymphoma assay being the current best choice. The three assays, if negative, willprovide sufficient information for the assessment of most chemicals.However where high, or moderate and prolonged, levels of exposure areexpected (eg most human medicines) an in-vivoassay is recommended to provide additional reassurance regarding lack of mutagenic activity.Decisions on the extent of testing appropriate for given exposure levels ofspecific chemicals need to be taken by the relevant regulatory authority on acase-by-case basis. 2.19 Stage 2 involves an assessment of whether genotoxic activity seen in any of thein vitro tests can be expressed in somatic cells in vivo. In addition, one appropriate in-vivotest is needed for all chemicals (which are negative in in- vitroassays) for which human exposure is expected to be high, or moderate and prolonged. Aflexible approach is needed with consideration of thenature of the chemical, its metabolism and results obtained in the initial in- vitrotests. The most appropriate initial test will be a bone marrow micronucleus assay unless the initial considerations give an indication to thecontrary. Techniques for the assessment of whole chromosomes areappropriate if there is evidence of aneugenicity. If negative results areobtained in this assay additional testing in other tissue(s) will be required forall compounds that are positive in-vitro, to provide adequate reassurance for the absence of activity in vivo.The type of study (or studies) needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis having regard to the available informationon the compound including the results from earlier tests. Studies that may beappropriate include liver UDS assay, comet assay, the reasons forthe choice of assay in a specific given situation should be justified. 2.20 Stage 3 consists of assays in germ cells. The need for such studies requires careful consideration. In most cases chemicals that are recognised as in-vivo somatic cell mutagens will be assumed to be both potential genotoxiccarcinogens and potential germ cell mutagens, and no further genotoxicitytesting is necessary. However, in some cases germ cell studies may need tobe undertaken to demonstrate that a somatic cell mutagen is not a germ cellmutagen. Information on whether a compound is genotoxic in germ cellsmay be obtained from a dominant lethalassay and mutation assays in transgenic animals). Information on theinduction of DNAlesions in germ cells may be obtained using the variousapproaches listed for phase 2. Consideration of the type of mutationproduced in earlier studies is important when selecting the appropriate assay.None of these assays provide conclusive information as to whether effectswill be seen in future generations, and the only methods on which risk 65Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentestimates for the effects can currently be based are the heritable translocation test and the mouse specific locus test. These are not practical options in viewof the very large number of animals needed. Currently there are no routinemethods available for investigating the induction of aneuploidy in offspringfollowing exposure of parental animals. Thresholds for aneugens: Extrapolation of data from somatic cells to germ cells. 2.21 The safety evaluation of aneuploidy inducing chemicals (aneugens) acting by inhibition of microtubule formation is based on the identification of athreshold dose or NOELbelow which aneuploidy is not induced. Benomyl,carbendazim and thiophanate-methyl belong to the methyl benzimadazolecarbamate (MBCs) class of chemicals. The MBC class of chemicals arewidely used in approved pesticide products as fungicides and also inveterinary medicines including anthelmintics in both food producing andcompanion animals. These chemicals act by interfering with microtubuleformation during mitosis. The Committee was asked by the AdvisoryCommittee on Pesticides (ACP) to advise on the applicability of extrapolatingto germ cells evidence for thresholds for induced aneuploidy obtained instudies on somatic cells, and the relevance of these conclusions for theapproach used by PSD to evaluate aneuploidy data in the risk assessment ofagricultural pesticides, specifically in respect of MBCs. 2.22 The Specialised Experts concluded that \"..current knowledge does not allow extrapolation to meiotic cells of the in-vitrofinding of a threshold [for induced in somatic cells]. Meiosis I is fundamentally differentfrom mitosis in the structures and processes involved in chromosomesegregation. Due to the current lack of knowledge on the interaction ofaneugens with these possible targets, the concept of a threshold for inducedaneuploidy in germ cells is as yet a hypothetical one.\" The Committeeundertook a detailed review of a study published by de Stoppelaar JM, et al, (1999) Mutagenesis, 14, 621-631, which had been identified as the critical piece of evidence used by the Specialised Experts in reaching theirconclusion. 2.23 The Committee concluded that the aneuploidy induced by methyl benzimadazole carbamates (specifically benomyl, carbendazim andthiophanate-methyl) which act by inhibiting spindle formation is a threshold-related effect. There is a sound scientific basis to assume that these chemicalshave a threshold of action in both somatic and germ cells. The Committee didnot agree with the interpretation reached by the European Commission'sGroup of Specialised Experts in fields of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and 66Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentreprotoxicity at its meeting of the 1-2 September 1999 particularly with regard to the finding by de Stoppelaar et al(1999) of the induction of diploid sperm in rats in the absence of induction of micronuclei in peripheralerythrocytes. The Committee considered the finding of diploid sperm to be anexpected effect of carbendazim on male germ cells undergoing meiosis andentirely consistent with the known effects of this chemical on microtubuleformation. 2.24 Acopy of the statement providing the detailed evaluation of the relevant data is given at the end of this report. Ongoing Work 2.25 The Committee has agreed to consider Risk Assessment of mutagens other than aneugens with regard to thresholds during 2001. 67Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentStatements of the COM Statement on the Mutagenicity of Hydroquinone Phenol Statement on Mutagenicity of 3-Monochloropropane 1,2- Diol (3-MCPD)Statement on Alcoholic Beverages : Update on Information Published Between 1995-2000. Statement on Thresholds for Aneugens : Extrapolation of Data from Somatic Cells to Germ Cells 68Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentSTATEMENT ON THE MUTAGENICITY OF HYDROQUINONE AND PHENOL Introduction 1. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) asked for advice from the Committee during 1994 and 1995 and most recently in 1999 on the interpretation of themutagenicity data on hydroquinone and phenol. The advice from COM wasrequired by HSE as part of its regulatory reviews of occupational exposurelimits to hydroquinone and phenol. 2. The principal use for hydroquinone is in the manufacture of black and white film developers. Other uses include the manufacture of antioxidants andpolymerisation inhibitors; as a chemical intermediate in the manufacture ofpharmaceutical, agrochemicals and dyes; in the production of cosmetics andtopical creams; and as a laboratory reagent. Occupational exposure tohydroquinone in the UK is mainly via inhalation of airborne concentrationsusually below 1 mg m -3and averaging about 0.15 mg.m3[8 hour time weighted average (TWA)]. Dermal exposure to hydroquinone in theoccupational setting is low. [The current UK occupational 15 minute short-term exposure limit (STEL).1] 3. Phenol is mostly used in the manufacture of phenolic resins, and is also used in the manufacture of disinfectants, some shampoos and in the preparation ofsoaps. The highest occupational exposures would be expected to occur in thepaint stripping of aircraft, where exposures are controlled to below 8 mg.m -3 (8 hour TWA). The other possible circumstances where high exposures mayoccur is in the use of phenolic resins in foundries. The resins contain smallamounts of free phenol and whilst most exposures are very low, in somespecial cases exposures of up to 12 mg.m -3(8-hour TWA) may occur. There are no data available for occupational dermal exposure to phenol. However,as personal protective equipment is known to be extensively used, it isconsidered that exposure via the skin will be very low. [The current UKoccupational inhalation exposure limits for phenol are 20 mg.m -3 as an 8-hour TWAand 39 mg.m-3 as a 15 minute STEL.2] Overview of COM considerations. 4. Abrief overview of the Committee's discussions held in 1994, 1995 and 1999 is given below. Full details of the Committee's considerations in 1994 and1995 have been published in the Annual reports. 2,3 69Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment5. In 1994, the COM agreed that both hydroquinone and phenol should be regarded as somatic cell in-vivomutagens.4-11The Committee agreed that for exposure to these two compounds by the oral route there was potential for athreshold of activity as there was good evidence that two protectivemechanisms (namely rapid conjugation and detoxification via the glutathionepathway) would substantially reduce systemic exposure to any activemetabolites formed. However, Members agreed that there were insufficientdata on inhalation and dermal exposure and it was not possible to assume thata threshold existed for activity when exposure was via the respiratory tract orthe skin. The Committee noted the information from one published paper thatwhen radiolabelled phenol was given intratracheally, initially all theradiolabel in the plasma was present as phenol. 12These data suggested that there was little conjugation of phenol on the \"first-pass\" from airways to thecirculation. The Committee recommended that appropriate toxicokineticstudies were needed. 6. In 1995, a submission from industry to the HSE provided some additional studies on the metabolism of hydroquinone and phenolic derivatives in thelung and skin, HSE requested the Committee's assessment of these newdata. 13-20 7. The Committee agreed that the new data on the metabolism of hydroquinone and phenol in animals and in humans were valuable but appropriate studies todetermine the extent of pre-systemic metabolism following either inhalationor dermal exposure had not been undertaken. It was agreed that the followingstudies were needed to answer this question: i) Further in-vivostudies in rats or dogs using administration of hydroquinone or phenol via a bronchoscope with very early samplingfor free and conjugated test substance in the blood. ii) It was essential that the method be sensitive enough to measure both free and conjugated substance. iii) Additional investigations in volunteers following dermal administration would also be useful but should be undertaken usinghigher doses of hydroquinone and early sampling times. (Membersacknowledged that the skin irritancy of phenol would limit the doselevel of this compound that could be studied.) 8. In 1999, further data from published papers on the kinetics of hydroquinone in rats following intratracheal instillation and on its percutaneous absorptionin in-vitrostudies using rat skin and human stratum corneum were provided to the Committee. 21,22Anumber of additional in-vivomutagenicity studies 70Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentincluding an investigation of site of contact mutagenicity in skin and respiratory tract of MutaTMmice using the LacZ transgene were also considered.23-25 9. Regarding the new data on hydroquinone,23the Committee agreed that a positive result had been obtained in a new bone-marrow micronucleus assayand that these results were consistent with previous studies considered in1994. The new toxicokinetic study in which rats were given a singleintratracheal dose of 14C-hydroquinone showed detectable free hydroquinone in arterial blood within 5-10 seconds after dosing.21This new information suggested a potential risk of site-of- contact and systemic mutagenic effectsfollowing inhalation exposure to hydroquinone. 10. Regarding the new data on phenol, the new bone-marrow micronucleus studies showed that a small but consistent positive result with phenol couldbe identified in studies conducted according to OECD guidelines atintraperitoneal dose levels of around 100-160 mg/kg. 23,24 11. The Committee considered the new transgenic mutagenicity test with phenol using the LacZ transgene in MutaTMmice.25Animals were given either dermal doses of 100 mg/kg bw or exposed for a period of 2 hours to a vapourcontaining 100 ppm phenol (390 mg.m -3) on five consecutive days. Samples of tissues (liver, bone marrow, and blood, and also, for inhalation exposure,nasal epithelia and lung) were taken at a number of time points after dosingand the DNAextracted and packaged for analysis of LacZ mutants. Membersnoted that a positive control chemical (benzo(a)pyrene) had been used for thedermal studies but no positive control had been used for the inhalation studiespresumably because of the potential hazards involved in handling andcontrolling exposures to test animals. Members acknowledged that therewould be an observable degree of inter-animal variation in results for in-vivo mutation assays such as LacZ, which complicates the assessment of data butagreed that the results reported for the study concerned could not be assessedin view of the failure to obtain acceptable levels of DNApackaging in manyof the trials. The Committee considered that inhalation exposure to phenolfollowed by assessment of mutation frequency in nasal tissue were critical tothe identification of site-of-contact mutagenicity and felt that a further studywith acceptable levels of DNApackaging would be needed before anyconclusions on site-of-contact mutagenicity could be reached. 71Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentOverall conclusions 12. The Committee reached the following conclusions based on all the available information. Hydroquinone a. Hydroquinone is an in-vivomutagen in somatic cells,4-11but there is no convincing evidence for effects in germ cells in vivo.26-28Any risk to human health by ingestion would be likely to be greatly reduced byrapid conjugation and detoxification via the glutathione pathway.Furthermore, mutagenicity appeared to be positively related toperoxidase activity while catalase could also have a protective role. 29 Actual systemic exposure levels in humans would be very much lowerthan levels at which positive results had been achieved in studies inanimals. b. The Committee concluded that by the oral route there was potential for a threshold of activity based on the protective mechanisms outlined at(a). c. However, there is insufficient evidence to support a threshold approach to risk assessment for inhalation or dermal exposure to hydroquinone. d. The Committee concluded that the available data showed that occupational exposure to hydroquinone was associated with amutagenic hazard but it was not possible to quantify the risk. Phenol a.In-vitromutagenicity data on phenol were of poor quality and results difficult to interpret, but in-vivodata show phenol to be a somatic cell mutagen following intraperitoneal doses of approximately 100-160mg/kg 5,8,23,24No conclusions can be drawn from the one available study in transgenic animals (MutaTMmice) on site-of-contact mutagenicity following dermal or inhalation exposure.25The Committee felt that a further study in transgenic animals, withacceptable levels of DNApackaging, would be helpful before anyconclusions on site-of-contact mutagenicity could be reached. Datafrom germ cell studies in vivowere inadequate to allow any definite conclusions to be drawn. 30,31 72Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentb. Any risk to human health by ingestion would be likely to be greatly reduced by rapid conjugation and detoxification via the glutathionepathway. Furthermore mutagenicity also appeared to be positivelyrelated to peroxidase activity while catalase could also have aprotective role. Actual systemic exposure levels in humans would bevery much lower than levels at which positive results had beenachieved in studies in animals. c. The Committee concluded that by the oral route there was potential for a threshold of activity based on the protective mechanism outlined at(b). d. However, there is insufficient evidence to support a threshold approach to risk assessment for inhalation or dermal exposure to phenol. e. The Committee concluded that the available data showed that occupational exposure to phenol was associated with a mutagenichazard but it was not possible to quantify the risk.

These polyamine flocculants have been available for manyyears as approved products for use in water treatment and thus 3-MCPD maybe present in drinking water from their use. 3-MCPD is a member of a groupof contaminants known as chloropropanols. This group includes some knowngenotoxic carcinogens in animals such as 1,3-dichloropropan-2-ol. The COMwas asked in 1999 to evaluate the available mutagenicity data on 3-MCPDand to provide conclusions for the Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC) whohad been asked to consider the carcinogenicity data on 3-MCPD. The COMwas aware that 3-MCPD had been detected as a contaminant of several foodsand food ingredients, including acid hydrolysed vegetable protein (acid-HVP)and that the EU Scientific Committee for Food had published an opinion in1994 where it was agreed that 3-MCPD should be regarded as a genotoxiccarcinogen. 1 2. In 1999 the COC noted that in a carcinogenicity study undertaken by Sunahara et al(1993) 1,3-MCPD was administered via drinking water to groups of 50 male and 50 female (aged 6 weeks at start) F344 rats for aperiod of 104 weeks. 2Statistically significant increases in leydig cell adenomas (intermediate and high dose level) and mammary glandfibroadenomas (high dose level) had been noted in males and a statisticallysignificant increase in kidney tumours had been noted in females at the highdose level. The COC had noted in 1999 that the high dose level had exceededthe Maximum Tolerated Dose. The COC therefore asked the COM for anassessment of the mutagenicity data on 3-MCPD as part of its evaluation ofthe mechanism for the carcinogenic effects seen in rats. Evaluation: 1999 3. The Committee was aware that 3-MCPD had been detected as a contaminant of savoury food ingredients, including acid hydrolysed vegetable protein(acid-HVP) and that the EU Scientific Committee for Food had published anopinion in 1994 where it was agreed that 3-MCPD should be regarded as agenotoxic carcinogen. 1The Committee also had access to published mutagenicity data on 3-MCPD, a safety evaluation prepared by CanTox Inc(Ontario, Canada) for the International Hydrolysed Protein Council, 3a review 77Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentdocument published by the Institute of Toxicology, National Food Agency of Denmark,4and one in-vivomutagenicity submitted in an in-confidence basis.5 In reviewing these documents, members commented that the available metabolism data on 3-MCPD were relatively old and focused on metabolicpathways following intraperitoneal administration. There was no oral massbalance investigation available. The Committee considered the proposal byCanTox Inc regarding the formation of bacterial-specific mutagens andagreed that there was no evidence to support this speculation. 4. The Committee reached the following conclusions on the mutagenicity data available in 1999. i) 3-MCPD was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation. 6-9The addition of S-9 mix did not increase the mutagenic response observed. ii) Positive results have also been reported in the mouse lymphoma assay in the presence of metabolic activation,4but the full report of the study was not available to the Committee. Positive results were also reportedin tests in yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) 10and in tests for Sister Chromatid Exchange in mammalian cells.4 iii) The Committee concluded that 3-MCPD had mutagenic activity in- vitro. iv) Negative results have been reported from a bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice using a single oral dose of up to 120 mg/kg bw andsampling of bone marrow at 24, 48 or 72 hours post administration.The authors stated that higher doses would result in significant weightloss and mortality. The Committee noted that there was no evidence fora reduction in the ratio of polychromatic to normochromaticerythrocytes (ie ratio of PCE/NCE) and thus there was no evidence toshow exposure of the bone marrow to the test material and itsmetabolites had occurred. 5 v) The Committee agreed that no conclusions could be drawn from the investigation of colonic micronuclei in mice5in view of the limited database available for this assay or from the inadequately reporteddominant lethal assays. 11,12 vi) The Committee agreed that further negative results in an in-vivo mutagenicity test in a second tissue, namely rat liver UDS, wererequired in order to provide adequate reassurance that the activity seenin vitrois not expressed in vivo. 78Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentEvaluation: 2000 5. The Committee considered two new in-vivomutagenicity studies commissioned by the UK Drinking Water Inspectorate at its October 2000meeting. These comprised a rat bone-marrow micronucleus test and a rat liverUDS assay, both of which are widely used to assess genotoxicity in vivo. Rat in-vivo bone-marrow micronucleus test13 6. sex [male (Crl: HanWist BR): group size 6] was used as there was no substantial sexdifferences in toxicity. The top dose was selected from a range-finding studyin which single oral doses of between 20-100 mg/kg bw were administeredonce daily for two consecutive days to groups of male and female rats. Doselevels of 60 mg/kg bw resulted in severe toxicity and some deaths. In themain study, doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg bw were given for two consecutivedays. Signs of toxicity were seen at the top dose level (piloerection) whichwas also associated with a clear reduction in polychromatic erythrocytes, indicating or its metabolites reached the bone-marrow). 7. There was no increase in the number of micronucleated PCEs at any dose level in 3-MCPD treated animals (2000 polychromatic erythrocytesscored/animal). The positive control, cyclophosphamide produced a clearincrease in micronuclei . Rat Liver UDS assay14 8. The UDS assay protocol conformed to OECD protocol 486. The top dose, a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg bw, was chosen on the basis of a sightingtoxicity study which had shown severe toxicity at oral doses of 150 mg/kgbw. In the main study single oral doses of 40 mg/kg bw or 100 mg/kg bwwere administered to male rats (Han Wistar) and hepatocytes recovered forUDS analysis using autoradiography (4 animals/dose level)and 2-4 hours (5 animals/dose level). No signs of toxicity were seen at eitherdose level. There was no evidence for any increase in UDS at either doselevel or time point. The two positive control substances (2-AAF and DMN)both gave clear positive results. 79Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentDiscussion 9. Members agreed that 3-MCPD has a chemical structure which suggests that it may be metabolised to genotoxic intermediates (particularly glycidol). 3-MCPD was clearly mutagenic salmonella assay and in the mouse lymphoma assay in the presence of metabolic activation. 10. The committee noted that the predominant urinary metabolite in rats fed or given intraperitoneal doses of 3-MCPD was \u00df-chlorolactic acid 15ie by a pathway not producing glycidol or other genotoxic intermediates. Adegradation product of \u00df-chlorolactic acid, namely oxalic acid, has beendocumented to induce the nephrotoxic effects seen with 3-MCPD. 5,16 One study has also shown that 3-MCPD may be metabolised by a minor pathwayand undergo conjugation with glutathione to ultimately form a mercapturicacid in urine of rats [N-acetyl-S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) cysteine], 17 suggesting the formation of a reactive metabolite, glycidol, at low levels thatare subsequently inactivated. The COM considered that the metabolism of the3-MCPD in rats had not been fully examined, but agreed that evidence fromthe two new in-vivomutagenicity studies supported the view that reactive metabolites were not produced in the tissues where genotoxicity wasassessed. Thus the Committee reached the following conclusions. Conclusion 11. The Committee concluded that both the rat bone-marrow micronucleus test and the rat liver UDS test had been carried out to an acceptable standard andwere negative. Thus the additional information recommended by the COM asbeing necessary to provide adequate reassurance that the mutagenic activityseen in vitrowas not expressed in vivohad now been provided. 12. The Committee agreed that the major urinary metabolite \u00df-chlorolactic acid in rats was formed by oxidation of 3-MCPD and that the two newmutagenicity studies supported the view that reactive metabolites if formeddid not produce genotoxicity in vivoin the tissues assessed. 13. The Committee concluded that 3-MCPD can be regarded as having no significant genotoxic potential in vivo.

In 1995 the COM gave detailed consideration to the mutagenicity of ethanol, acetaldehyde and alcoholic beverages. This was to provide input to theGovernment Interdepartmental Working Group reviewing overall advice onthis topic. The Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC) also carried out adetailed review of the available data, mainly from epidemiology studies on thecarcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages. The advice from these Committeeswas considered by the Interdepartmental Working Group when drawing uptheir Report on Sensible Drinking published in December 1995. 1The main conclusions reached were: i) The COC concluded that the epidemiological evidence supported the view that drinking alcohol causes a dose-related increase in the risk ofsquamous carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract as a whole, andfor cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and oesophagus. ii) The COM agreed that the consumption of alcoholic beverages does not present any significant concern with respect to their mutagenic potential. 2. With regard to the COC conclusions on the particularly important topic of the association between alcohol and breast cancer, the Committee felt that whilethere was no decisive evidence that breast cancer is causally related todrinking alcohol, the potential significance for public health of a weak causalassociation between alcohol and breast cancer was such that theyrecommended that this matter be kept under review. 3. The COC has recently finalised its review of the published literature from 1995-1999 on alcohol and breast cancer ( www .doh.gov.uk/coc.htm ). The COC concluded: i) There is an association between drinking alcoholic beverages and increased risk of breast cancer. It is difficult to resolve whether this iscausal. The magnitude of the observed association is small (ie therelative risk is modest and, even for heavy drinkers, rarely in excess of3) and within the range where it is difficult to exclude bias and/orconfounding as explanations for the observed results in epidemiologicalstudies. It is difficult to derive a quantitative relationship from thedose-response data available in the literature. 83Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentii) Further epidemiological studies have been published since 1995. There is a need for further systematic review of the epidemiologicalliterature to assess fully the influence of bias, confounding and effectmodification. This will contribute to a conclusion on causality andpopulation attributable risk associated with drinking alcoholicbeverages. iii) Studies of possible mechanisms provide evidence for a plausible basis for the causation of breast cancer by consumption of alcohol. Alcoholincreases blood levels of oestrogens and in particular oestradiol in bothpremenopausal and postmenopausal women. These data suggested asimilar mechanism to other known breast cancer risk factors. iv) The COM should be asked to update its opinion of 1995 on the mutagenicity data on alcohol. 4. This statement details the conclusions reached by the COM with regard to the published information on ethanol, acetaldehyde and alcoholic beverages from1995 to February 2000, and whether there was any need to modify theconclusions drawn in 1995. The Committee recalled that alcoholic beveragescontain small amounts of a significant number of volatile and non-volatileorganic compounds formed during production, storage and maturation. TheCommittee reaffirmed its view that it was not essential nor practical to reviewthese constituents individually for their mutagenic potential. 5. The conclusions reached with regard to the mutagenic potential of ethanol, acetaldehyde and alcoholic beverages are given below. Adiscussion of onerecent hypothesis 1that alcohol might induce breast cancer via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is also included.2 Mutagenicity of ethanol 6. The Committee noted that there were no new in-vitromutagenicity studies with ethanol. No conclusions could be drawn regarding the in-vitro investigations of effects of ethanol in the pre-implantation development ofmouse oocytes injected with spermatozoa stored in 70% ethanol. 3 7. The Committee reaffirmed its previous conclusions with regard to the mutagenicity data on ethanol, namely: negative results have been obtained ina wide range of in-vitrotests and in in-vivotests including those for effects on germ cells; it was concluded that there was no evidence that ethanol inducesgerm cell mutation in vivo. 84Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentMutagenicity of acetaldehyde 8. The committee agreed that the most recent experiments using human lymphoma cells had confirmed earlier studies that acetaldehyde inducesprotein-DNAcross links, but only at concentrations which resulted in celldeath. In addition acetaldehyde induced HPRTmutations in human Tcells. 5 Members agreed that no conclusions could be drawn from the finding ofacetaldehyde DNAadducts in peripheral white blood cells of alcoholics inview of lack of control for the effects of smoking by alcoholics in the studygroup and the well known abnormalities in metabolism in alcoholics. 6 9. The Committee reaffirmed its previous conclusions with regard to acetaldehyde. The available data show that acetaldehyde induceschromosome aberrations in mammalian cells in the absence of an exogenousmetabolising fraction. There is some evidence to show that covalent binding(DNA-protein cross links) in the nasal mucosa of rats exposed to high levelsof acetaldehyde by inhalation. 10. The mutagenic profile of acetaldehyde is very similar to that of formaldehyde. The compound has direct acting mutagenic potential in vitro, but would only be expected to have the potential of in-vivoactivity at sites where it is not rapidly metabolised to acetic acid. The COC has concludedthat the observation of tumours in animals exposed to high inhalation dosesof acetaldehyde is not relevant to drinking alcohol. 1 Mutagenicity of Alcoholic Beverages 11. The Committee recalled that in 1995, considerable weight had been attached to one study from the Medical Research Council's Cell Mutation Unit, whohas examined hprt mutant frequency in circulating T-lymphocytes of normaladults and the relationship with alcohol intake. 7The study showed that alcohol intake in 143 people over the range of 0-56 units/week (1 unit - 8gethanol) had no effects on hprt mutant frequency. Less weight had beenplaced on studies which examined the mutagenicity of concentrated extractsof wines and sprits in bacteria, 1and the significance of such data was felt to be questionable. There were no adequate in-vivomutagenicity studies of alcoholic beverages available in 1995 or for the current review. 12. Since 1995 two further studies of the relationship between hprt mutant frequency in lymphocytes obtained from individuals for whom informationon drinking patterns were available. 8,9There was no association between hprt mutant frequency and alcohol ingestion in these studies, thus confirmingthe results of the earlier MRC investigation. 85Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentThe Reactive Oxygen Species hypothesis of alcohol induced breast cancer 13. Members reviewed the hypothesis published by Wright et al.2Wright and colleagues had noted the finding that alcohol metabolism is known to producereactive oxygen species (ROS) and mammary tissue contains the necessarymetabolising enzymes to produce ROS from alcohol. In addition, Wright andcolleagues noted two further observations which supported their hypothesis,namely that breast cancer is associated with higher levels of hydroxylmodified DNAand iron, which has been proposed to catalyse the formationof ROS, accumulated with time in breast tissue. Members agreed that therewas evidence that ethanol and its metabolites induced the formation of freeradicals in vitro, but the evidence in vivowas conflicting. Members commented that the observations reported by Wright and colleagues might bea result of tumour progression rather than an initiator of cancer. In addition itwas noted that co-administration of iron and alcohol to rats in the initiationphase of a two stage model for hepatocarcinogenesis 10did not result in any genotoxic effects. Overall, the COM concluded that there was insufficientevidence to support the Wright et alhypothesis regarding breast cancer. Overall Conclusion 13. The Committee reaffirmed its 1995 conclusion that consumption of alcoholic beverages does not present any significant concern with respect to theirmutagenic potential.

These are widely usedin approved pesticide products as fungicides and also in veterinary medicines,in particular as anthelmintics, in both food producing and companion animals.These chemicals act by interfering with microtubule formation during mitosis.The COM has provided advice to the UK regulatory Authorities namely thePesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate(VMD) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the mostappropriate approach for the risk assessment of MBCs. 1-3 2. In 1993 the COM agreed that it was reasonable to assume that aneuploidy inducing chemicals (particularly those that function by interfering with thespindle apparatus of cell division) have a threshold of action. 1The safety evaluation of aneuploidy inducing chemicals (aneugens) acting by inhibitionof microtubule formation is based on the identification of a threshold dosebelow which aneuploidy does not occur. The Committee provided advice onmethodology for identifying thresholds in 1993, namely appropriate in-vitro experiments in human lymphocytes using the detection and quantification ofnon-disjunction, chromosome loss and centromere positive micronuclei usingFISH (Fluorescent in-situ hybridisation) analysis of selected chromosomes forcentromeric DNA. This advice was used by PSD and VMD when requestingdata from approval/licence holders of products containing MBCs. In 1996, theCommittee considered the results of experiments undertaken with benomyland carbendazim and concluded that the studies had been satisfactorilyconducted and the data indicated No Observed Effect Levels (NOELs) forthese two chemicals. 4-6It was noted that that it would be difficult to define 88Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentprecise thresholds for activity from these data and the mathematical models that had been used for their analysis. Appropriate studies which providedevidence for a threshold effect have also been undertaken with thiophanate-methyl. 7 3. The UK Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) considered that the available in vitroaneuploidy data were consistent with a threshold for MBC- induced aneuploidy. The ACPconsidered that in vitroaneuploidy threshold studies should be regarded as providing data that underpinned the regulatorydecision rather than providing critical NOELS for direct use in settingAcceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level(AOEL) values. The conclusions of the UK review have been passed to therapporteur for the ongoing EC review (under Directive 91/414/EEC) of theuse of MBCs as agricultural pesticides. 4. In the case of consumer safety for veterinary medicines, ADIs and Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) in edible tissues are set on a substance specific basisby the EU Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP). Allcurrently authorised veterinary medicines have been assessed on the basis ofthe concept that aneuploidy induced by spindle inhibitors is a threshold effect. Background to current review 5. The Committee was asked by the ACPto consider the conclusions reached by the European Commission's Group of Specialised Experts who wereconsidering the classification and labelling of benomyl, carbendazim andthiophanate-methyl under the Dangerous Substances Directive 67/548/EEC.The Committee considered a draft summary record of the meeting of theSpecialised Experts held on the 1-2 September 1999. 8The Committee was asked by the ACPto advice on the applicability of extrapolating to germ cells,evidence for thresholds for induced aneuploidy obtained in studies on somaticcells, and the relevance of those conclusions for the approach used by PSD toevaluate aneuploidy data in the risk assessment of agricultural pesticides. TheCommittee has not been asked to comment on the proposals for classificationand labelling of these MBCs. Conclusion reached by Specialised Experts 6. The Specialised Experts concluded that \"..current knowledge does not allow extrapolation to meiotic cells of the in-vitrofinding of a threshold [for induced in somatic cells]. Meiosis I is fundamentally differentfrom mitosis in the structures and processes involved in chromosome 89Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentsegregation. Due to the current lack of knowledge on the interaction of aneugens with these possible targets, the concept of a threshold for inducedaneuploidy in germ cells is as yet a hypothetical one.\" 7. The COM considered that the critical piece of evidence used to reach this conclusion came from the publication by de Stoppelaar et al(1999) which reported diploidy (ie polyploidy but of rats exposedto carbendazim. 9de Stoppelaar et alconcluded that their findings suggested that diploidy in sperm is induced at a lower dose level than micronuclei inperipheral blood erythrocytes (no micronuclei were seen in this study). TheCommittee reaffirmed that there was adequate information available on themechanism of interaction of MBCs with microtubules to assess the effects ofthese chemicals in both somatic and germ cells. The Committee agreed ittherefore important to review the results obtained by de Stoppelaar et alin detail in order to comment on the conclusions reached by the SpecialisedExperts. Consideration of de Stoppelaar et al Mutagenesis, 14, 621-631, 1999 8. Groups of 5 Wistar (Unilever) rats aged 13-14 week were given a single oral dose of carbendazim (50, 150, 450 or 800 mg/kg bw) in corn oil. The controlgroup received corn oil only. Afurther group of 5 rats were given anintraperitoneal dose of 150 mg/kg bw carbendazim in corn oil. The animalswere killed at thirty-one or 50 days (at 450 mg/kg bw only) and epididymalsperm isolated. In a second experiment, groups of three rats received a singleoral dose of carbendazim (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150, 450, 800 mg/kgbw) in corn oil. Agroup of 4 rats received 3 mg/kg bw mitomycin C(intraperitoneal) and the negative control received corn oil only. One daybefore and 48 hours and 72 hours after treatment peripheral blood sampleswere collected from the tail vein for assessment of micronucleatederythrocytes. The animals in the second experiment were killed thirty-onedays after treatment and epididymal sperm isolated. Fluorescence in situhybridisation was carried out using DNAprobes specific for rat chromosomes4 and Y(and 19 in the second experiment). Additional analyses wereundertaken using some animals from the first experiment for chromosome 4and 19 to confirm the presence of diploid sperm. Five thousand sperm werescored on two slides per animal (ie 10,000 sperm per animal). Only one slidewas scored for rats treated intraperitioneally or in trials where rats were killedat 50 days after treatment. 90Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment9. The main finding of experiment one was a small but dose-related increase in the absolute frequency of diploid sperm (0.03% to 0.22%) following oraldosing and analysis of sperm at 31 days after treatment. An increase in spermclassified as diploid was only seen in one of five animals followingintraperitoneal treatment with carbendazim at 150 mg/kg bw. No increase in'diploid'sperm was seen in animals killed 50 days after treatment with anoral dose of 450 mg/kg bw carbendazim. The Committee noted that a smallerincreased frequency of diploid sperm was reported in the second experimentin animals given an oral dose of 800 mg/kg bw carbendazim which may haveresulted from sub-optimal exposure conditions in the experiment. Nomicronuclei were induced in peripheral blood erythrocytes following oraltreatment of up to 800 mg/kg bw after sampling peripheral blood at 24 or 48hours post treatment. 10. The Committee noted that the mechanism of action of carbendazim involved interference with the formation of polar microtubules. This effect combinedwith differences in the type of nuclear organising centres (NOC's) for germcells in first meiotic division in males (a single pole) and in females (multiplepoles) would result in carbendazim inducing polyploidy in sperm andaneuploidy in oocytes. The Committee agreed that the finding of diploid butnot aneuploid sperm by de Stoppelaar et alwas to be expected. The Committee noted the finding of aneuploid oocytes in hamsters given a singleoral dose of 1000 mg/kg bw carbendazim was also an expected finding. 10The Committee considered that in the case of MBCs such as benomyl,carbendazim and thiophanate-methyl that affect the formation of spindles itwas scientifically plausible for such compounds to be aneugenic in bothsomatic and germ cells. There is currently no evidence to suggest that MBCsare capable of modifying meiosis I specific events such as chromosomepairing. The Committee agreed that it would be expected that MBCs had athreshold of activity in somatic and germ cells. 11. The Committee considered that the results obtained by de Stoppelaar et aldid not provide evidence for a lower threshold for aneuploidy in germ cellscompared to somatic cells. The Committee felt that the analysis of peripheralblood samples for micronuclei in rats undertaken by de Stoppelaar et alwas suboptimal in that a 24 hour sampling time point should have been used asmicronucleated erythrocytes may have been efficiently removed by the spleenin rats and, as noted in paragraph 9 above, exposure conditions used may nothave been optimal for the production of micronuclei. The Committee agreedthat a more appropriate study in somatic cells for comparison with germ cellsin the rat would be an investigation of the dose-response for the formation ofmicronuclei containing aneuploid chromosomes in polychromaticerythrocytes obtained in bone marrow smears from rats treated using a similarprotocol to that used by de Stoppelaar et al. The Committee noted that such 91Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentdata would be informative with regard to any differences between aneuploidy in somatic and germ cells and agreed to review the subject when appropriatestudies had been undertaken. Even if it could be established that the effects onsperm occur at lower doses than for somatic cells, this would not invalidatethe concept of a threshold effect. Conclusions 12. The Committee agreed the following conclusions: i) The aneuploidy induced by methyl benzimadazole carbamates (specifically benomyl, carbendazim and thiophanate-methyl) which actby inhibiting spindle formation is a threshold related effect. There is asound scientific basis to assume that these chemicals have a thresholdof action in both somatic and germ cells. The Committee did not agreewith the interpretation reached by the European Commission's Groupof Specialised Experts in fields of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity andreprotoxicity at its meeting of the 1-2 September 1999 particularly withregard to the finding by de Stoppelaar et al 8of diploid sperm in rats. The Committee considered the finding of diploid sperm to be anexpected effect of carbendazim on male germ cells undergoing meiosisand entirely consistent with the known effects of this chemical onmicrotubule formation. ii) The Committee concluded that de Stoppelaar et al 9had not adequately demonstrated a lower threshold for aneuploidy in male germ cells ofthe rat compared to somatic cells. The Committee agreed that a moreappropriate study in somatic cells for comparison with germ cells inthe rat would be an investigation of the dose-response for the formationof micronuclei containing aneuploid chromosomes in polychromaticerythrocytes obtained in bone marrow smears from rats using a similartreatment protocol to that used by de Stoppelaar et al. The Committee agreed to review the subject when appropriate studies had beenundertaken. iii) The Committee agreed that the approach used for risk assessment of MBCs by regulatory authorities for pesticides and veterinary medicinesand the strategy outlined in the Pesticide Safety Directorate positionpaper on the role of aneuploidy in the risk assessment of agriculturalpesticides were acceptable but would need to be reviewed should amarked difference in sensitivity to aneuploidy induced by thesechemicals be reported between germ cells and somatic cells. 92Annual report 2000 Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentiv) The Committee agreed that these conclusions were only relevant to aneuploidy inducing chemicals acting by spindle inhibition. The riskassessment (ie consideration of thresholds in somatic and germ cells)of aneuploidy inducing chemicals acting via other mechanisms neededto be considered on a case by case basis.

Anew Committee has been recently appointed via openadvertisement procedures established by the Commissioner for PublicAppointments. The new appointments were made on 1 April 2000 to run for 3years. I would like to welcome the new members (Professor D Harrison, Ms DHowel, Professor D Phillips, Dr R Roberts and Professor D Shuker) to theCommittee. The details of the Membership are published on the Internet and theAgenda, Minutes and Statements are published on a regular basis. During the year 2000 the COC has published 3 statements; alcohol and breast cancer, carcinogenicity of 3-MCPD, cancer incidence near municipal solid wasteincinerators in Great Britain. The advice on alcohol and breast cancer was anupdate of data published between 1995 - 1999. The Committee made arecommendation for further research, namely a systematic review of epidemiology,which is being funded by the Department of Health. The Committee also providedadvice on research to be sponsored by the Department of Health on the earlyidentification of non-genotoxic carcinogens. Apreliminary assessment of a pre-publication paper on the trends in the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomawas undertaken. The Committee looks forward to assessing the final publishedversion of this particular research. The Committee also provided advice on teststrategies including the problems associated with poor survival in certain strains ofrat. During 2000, the Food Standards Agency was established and the COC now has a joint Secretariat with DH/FSA. The DH Toxicology Unit at the Imperial College ofScience, Technology and Medicine now prepare some of the papers for the COC. Professor PG Blain (Chairman) BMedSci MB as epichlorhydrin/amine copolymers used as flocculants or coagulant aids treatment. These polyamine flocculants have been available for manyyears as approved products for use in water treatment and thus 3-MCPD maybe present as a contaminant in drinking water arising from this use. 3-MCPDis a member of a group of contaminants known as chloropropanols. TheCommittee was aware that 3-MCPD had been detected as a contaminant ofseveral foods and food ingredients, including acid hydrolysed vegetableprotein (acid-HVP) The COC was asked to evaluate and advise on thecarcinogenicity of 3-MCPD by the Committee on Chemicals and Materials ofConstruction for use in Public Water Supply and Swimming Pools (CCM), astatutory committee which provides advice to the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, Transport and the Regions on the approval of chemicalsubstances in contact with public water supplies. 3.2 The COC had reviewed the available carcinogenicity data on 3-MCPD in 1999 and had concluded that it \"was not possible to draw a definite conclusionregarding the significance of the observed carcinogenic effects of 3-MCPD inthe rat.\" However, the COM conclusions were noted. These were that 3-MCPD was an in vitromutagen and that further in vivodata was needed to provide reassurances that this activity could not be expressed in vivo. The COC concluded that it would be prudent to assume that the compound was an in vivo mutagen. In view of these COM conclusions the COC agreed that it would beprudent to reduce exposures to as low as technologically practicable. 3.3 Another review of the carcinogenicity data was undertaken by the COC at its November 2000 meeting following further advice from the COM which hadreviewed new in-vivomutagenicity studies conducted using 3-MCPD. These provided evidence reactive (mutagenic) metabolites of 3-MCPD are notproduced in vivoin the tissues examined in these studies. In the light of the new data the COM was able to conclude that 3-MCPD is an in-vitromutagen but has no significant genotoxic potential in-vivo. The COC was asked to consider the implications of these revised conclusions on the mutagenicitydata for carcinogen risk assessment. 3.4 The Committee considered the proposal that all of the increases in tumours noted in rats were mediated by non-genotoxic mechanisms involving eithercytotoxicity (in respect of the findings in the kidney) or hormonaldisturbances. The possible influence of the stereoisomerism of 3-MCPD wasalso discussed. Members agreed that it was now probable that 3-MCPDinduced tumours by non-genotoxic mechanisms. 3.5 The Statement on 3-MCPD can be found at the end of this report. 102Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentAccelerator Mass Spectrometry - An aid to carcinogen risk assessment 3.6 Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) is the most sensitive technique available for measuring the formation of adducts with DNA. AMS technologyallows the accurate measurement of very low levels of radiolabelledchemicals (particularly 14C) in biological samples at around 10-21to 10-18 mole. The Committee was asked to consider the value of AMS for theassessment of chemically induced carcinogenicity. 3.7 The Committee noted that high levels of sensitivity and reproducibility in the analysis of biological samples were reported with AMS. The sensitivity ofthe technique was related to the background level of radioactivity in thesample and, if individual adducts are being investigated, the quality andeffectiveness of the HPLC separation used in the sample preparations. 3.8 The Committee concluded that AMS is a highly sensitive and reproducible technique. Its main uses in the area of chemical carcinogenicity are in hazardcharacterisation, measurement of tissue levels of administered radiolabelledcompounds and mechanistic investigations. However, the biologicalsignificance of the very low levels of binding that may be observed isdifficult to assess. Furthermore, the very high cost of the technology currentlylimits the use of AMS. The association between alcohol and breast cancer 3.9 Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. In England, approximately 30,000 cases are registered each year and there are roughly11,000 deaths from breast cancer. It is clearly important to identifypreventative measures to reduce the incidence of breast cancer. 3.10 The COC last reviewed the extensive literature on the association between alcohol and breast cancer in 1995, at the request of the InterdepartmentalWorking Group on Sensible Drinking (IDWG), as part of the review ofmedical and scientific evidence on alcohol and health and interpretation ofthe long term effects of drinking alcoholic beverages. The Committee advisedthe IDWG that drinking alcoholic beverages causes a dose-related increase inthe risk of squamous carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract as a whole,and of cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus which isindependent of the effect of smoking tobacco. 103Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment3.11 With respect to breast cancer, the Committee concluded \"... while there is no decisive evidence that breast cancer is causally related to drinking alcoholicbeverages, the potential significance, for public health, of even a weakassociation between alcohol and breast cancer is such that we recommend, inparticular, that this matter be kept under review.\" The IDWG endorsed theCOC's conclusions and the recommendation that the relationship betweenalcohol and breast cancer should be kept under review. 3.12 The Committee undertook a detailed review of the literature published since 1995 at three meetings in 1999 and finalised a statement at its March 2000meeting. It was evident that a large number of epidemiology studies had beenpublished since the first review. The Committee's finalised statement isappended to this report. The detailed secretariat papers considered during thereview have been published on the COC Website ( www .doh.gov.uk/coc.htm ) 3.13 Following publication of the COC statement, the Department of Health is funding a systematic review of the epidemiological literature at ImperialCollege of Science, Technology and Medicine. The study is due to becompleted by the end of 2001. The Committee discussed further the potentialmechanism by which alcohol might induce breast cancer at its November2000 meeting where members considered a draft scoping study by Dr TimKeys (ICRF, Oxford) on the investigation of the effects of alcohol onoestrogen metabolism. The Committee will consider this aspect in more detailwhen the report of the systematic review becomes available. 3.14 The Statement on Alcohol and Breast Cancer can be found at the end of this report. Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators on Great Britain 3.15 According to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), currently around 26 million tonnes of municipal waste is produced inthe UK each year; around 10% of this is disposed via incineration. In the UKall municipal waste incinerators (MWIs) are regulated by the EnvironmentAgency or local authorities. Since 1 December 1996, all MWIs have beenrequired to meet the standards in the Municipal Waste Incineration Directives89/369/EEC and 89/429/EEC and this resulted in the closure of the majorityof the existing incinerators and the upgrading of the remainder. Adioxinemission limit of 1 nanogram per cubic metre (ng.m -3) was imposed at the same time although, in practice, most existing plants already achieve dioxinemissions close to 0.1 ng.m -3. The Committee was informed that there is expected to be a significant increase in UK incinerator capacity over the next 104Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment10-20 years to meet the requirements of the EC Landfill Directive which sets limits for the percentage of biodegradable waste which may be landfilled. 3.16 There have been very few epidemiological studies published which investigated cancer incidence or mortality amongst individuals living in proximity toincinerators in Great Britain. The COC was asked during 1993-4 to commenton a study undertaken by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) whichinvestigated the cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near to 72MWIs. SAHSU is a research unit based at the Department of Epidemiologyand Public Health, Imperial College School of Science, Technology andMedicine. The study was subsequently published [Elliott P, et al(1996) Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain. British Journal of Cancer , 73, 702-710]. The study reported an increased incidence of liver cancer in people living near to MWIs. However, it was difficult tointerpret this finding because it is known that there is often misdiagnosis ofliver cancer, with secondary tumours originating in other organs being wronglyrecorded as primary liver cancer. The COC recommended that there should bea histological review of the liver cancer cases identified in the first study, todetermine whether there really was an increase in primary liver cancer inpeople living near MWIs. The report of this review was considered at the June1999 meeting and a statement subsequently agreed in March 2000 to coincidewith publication of the follow-up investigation [Elliott P et al (2000) Cancer Incidence near Municipal Solid Waste Incinerators in Great Britain 2 :Histopathological and Case Note Review of primary liver cancer cases. British Journal of Cancer , 82(5),1103-1106]. 3.17 The Committee concluded that any potential risk of cancer due to living near to MWIs (for periods in excess of 10 years) was exceedingly low andprobably not measurable by the most modern epidemiological techniques.The Committee agreed that, at the present time, there was no need for anyfurther epidemiological investigations of cancer incidence near MWIs. 3.18 Acopy of the full statement is given at the end of this section. 105Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentCode of Practice for Scientific Advisory Committees 3.19 In July 2000, the Office of Science and Technology published a consultation paper, inviting comments on a proposed code of practice for ScientificAdvisory Committees. The paper outlined proposed guidelines for ScientificAdvisory Committees and complemented a second document on \"Review OfRisk Procedures Used By The Government's Advisory Committees Dealingwith Food Safety\", which was published in September 2000. Theconsultation's paper described the duties, rights and responsibilities ofCommittee Members and their independence from the Committee'ssecretariat, stressing the need for inclusivity, transparency and proportionalityand raising the issue of the manner in which confidential information ishandled. It stressed the need for clear explanation of levels and types ofuncertainty, and how this information is incorporated into advice, and calledfor training of Committee Members in communication skills. 3.20 Members felt that the current arrangements for openness (publication of agenda, minutes, statements) were adequate. The Committee discussed theholding of open meetings. Some members felt that there would be no impacton Committee work whereas others felt that the role of specialist advisoryCommittees was to produce advice which could be subject to public scrutiny.It was agreed that any further proposals for greater openness needed carefulplanning in consultation with members and would place additional resourcerequirements on the secretariat. Early identification of non-genotoxic carcinogens 3.21 The development of rapid methods for the identification of chemicals that induce cancer by non-genotoxic mechanisms would be beneficial for publichealth, because it would enable more compounds to be tested. It would alsoreduce the need for long term studies which use large numbers of animals. Forthese reasons the COC identified this as an important research area whenconsidering research priorities in 1996. The COC reviewed a paper on thistopic, prepared by the DH Toxicology Unit, at the November 1999 meeting.Members agreed that the most important non-genotoxic mechanisms could beplaced into one of four groups, (i) persistent cytotoxicity accompanied byproliferative regeneration, (ii) chronic inflammation accompanied by theproduction of reactive oxygen species, (iii) hormomimetic activity and (iv)ligand binding with xenobiotic induction receptors. Members considered thatincreased cellular proliferation (mechanism (i)) was of particular significance. 106Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentMembers also noted that no one test would be suitable for the detection of all non-genotoxic carcinogens. 3.22 The COC recommended that further research to develop such tests was desirable and a project was commissioned from Professor Kevin Chipman.Professor Chipman made a presentation to the COC on the outline of theproposed research project. The studies were to involve daily administration ofselected chemicals to rats over a period of 28 days, using three dose levelsselected from the available information from carcinogenicity bioassays.Molecular markers indicative of disturbance of cell cycle control, intercellularcommunication and inhibition of apoptosis would be studied at two timepoints (after 3 days and 28 days of dosing). The evaluation of mediators wouldinvolve the use of immuno-histochemical methods including analysis ofphosphorylated gene products. 3.23 The Committee was asked to advise on priority chemicals for inclusion in the research project. Members agreed that priority should be given to carcinogensthat pose the greatest hazard to humans and were also carcinogenic to the rat.For pragmatic reasons the work would only consider the oral route of exposure.Members stressed the need for appropriate negative controls. It was noted thatinclusion of a further positive control (such as phenobarbitone or a peroxisomeproliferator) and d-limonene as a negative control in the female rat would bevaluable. Members agreed that TCDD, oestrodiol, hexachlorobenzene andtetrachloroethylene should be considered as suggested thatchloroform, nitrobenzene, alachlor, dichlorobenzene andparacetamol could be considered to be of interest. Evidence for an increase in mortality rates from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in England and Wales 1968-1996. 3.24 An increase in the age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) for all causes of liver cancer has been documented in England and Wales over the period 1979-1994. Apreliminary investigation suggested that the increase in mortalityfrom liver cancer may in part be due to an increase in the incidence ofintrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is arelatively rare tumour in the UK, and the prognosis for patients with thistumour is poor. The COC was asked to review the evidence for an increase inthe incidence of this tumour. 107Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment3.25 The Committee was provided with a prepublication copy of a draft report which presented a detailed analysis of mortality data provided by the Office ofNational Statistics (ONS). At the November 1999 meeting of the Committeemembers heard a presentation from Professor Howard Thomas and colleaguesat the Department of Medicine, Imperial College of Science, Technology andMedicine. 3.26 The total number of deaths attributed to particular tumours [using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 8 thand 9threvisions] were analysed by year and sex. Professor Thomas noted that in 1978 there was atotal of 95 deaths reported from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Englandand Wales, whereas there were 736 cancer deaths reported in 1996.Preliminary data from 1998 indicated a total of 835 deaths from intrahepaticcholangiocarcinoma. The increase in the ASMR over the period 1968 to 1996was from 0.1/100,000 to 1.22/100,000 in males and from 0.05/100,000 to0.92/100,000 in females. The age-specific mortality rates (ASpMR) in and females aged 45+ for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma increased byapproximately 15 fold over the study period. 3.27 It is possible that the recorded increase in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was an artefact due to confounding factors. The Committee noted that anumber of potential confounding factors had been considered by the authors,Professor Thomas and colleagues, such as changes in criteria for InternationalClassification of Disease codes (ICD revisions 8 and 9), the introduction ofendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the mid to late 1970s as anew diagnostic technique for facilitating precision in the location of site forseveral cancers of the hepatobiliary system and the consequent possibility thattumours which had previously been classified as tumours of the pancreas,gallbladder and extrahepatic biliary tree were now being classified ascholangiocarcinoma. The Committee agreed that changes in diagnosticstandards over time could account for the reported increase in age-standardised mortality rate for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma over theperiod 1968 to 1996. It was therefore important to undertake additionalinvestigations before a definite conclusion could be reached about the apparentincrease in the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. 3.28 The Committee agreed that it was important to keep this topic under review, and to assess further the work of Professor Thomas and colleagues whenpublished. 108Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentLongevity of carcinogenicity studies: consideration of a database prepared by Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) 3.29 The proper conduct of carcinogenicity studies in rats is an important part of the evaluation and prediction of potential human carcinogens. For a ratcarcinogenicity bioassay to be considered acceptable, survival at 24 monthsshould be 50% or greater in all groups (see OECD, EPAand EC guidelines).Significant reductions in the number of control rats surviving to the scheduledend of the study linked to obesity have been widely reported in the scientificliterature. This is a matter of concern since inadequate carcinogenicity studiescould result in failure to identify potential human carcinogens. In addition,inadequate studies could be rejected by regulatory agencies with theconsequent need to repeat the study using more animals to obtain a validresult. 3.30 PSD reviewed survival in control animals from 26 rat carcinogenicity studies which had been submitted over the period 1993-1998. These carcinogenicitytests had been undertaken between 1983 and 1995. Of these studies, 18 hadused Sprague-Dawley rats (from various sources), six used Wistar rats andtwo used Fischer 344 rats. Adequate survival was reported for 3/18 studies inSprague-Dawley rats, all of the studies in Wistar rats, and one studyundertaken in Fischer 344 rats. Most inadequate studies had been undertakenusing Charles River Sprague-Dawley rats. There was no evidence to support aprevious suggestion that virus antibody status had an effect on survival.Improved survival has been shown to occur in Sprague-Dawley rats whichhave been fed diets containing fewer calories or smaller portions. The USFood and Drugs Administration has been considering ways to improvesurvival by reducing the amount of food available to individual animals. 3.31 The Committee reached the following conclusions: i) Information from the database of rat carcinogenicity studies reviewed by PSD supports the view that unacceptable survival at termination(<50%) in carcinogenicity tests is predominantly confined to CharlesRiver Sprague-Dawley rats. Survival in long-term carcinogenicitybioassays should be compliant with current UK and EC guidelines fora negative result from such studies to be acceptable. ii) The available information supports the view reached by the COC in its guidelines published in 1991 that dietary restriction in carcinogenicitystudies should be applied with caution and is the responsibility of thetoxicologist undertaking the study. This subject may be reviewed whenmore information is available. 109Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment3.32 The Committee agreed to consider this topic further when the US Food and Drugs Administration publishes its revised proposals for dietary restriction. Ashort statement was published on the COC website in April 2000. Ongoing work 3.33 Full details of ongoing work can be found in the minutes of meetings published on the COC website. This has been substantially upgraded andnow contains a \"What's new\" section. Abrief review of the discussionsabout the influence of genetic susceptibility on chemical inducedcarcinogenesis is given below. Genetic susceptibility 3.34 The Committee was aware of increasing recognition of the modulating role of genetics in human disease and that there was evidence in some publishedepidemiological studies that genetic variation had a role in the metabolism ofchemical carcinogens in determining risk of cancer. The Committee was alsoaware that potential genetic susceptibility to environmental chemicals hadbeen the subject of media attention. Members held an initial discussion at theJuly 2000 meeting and agreed to a further detailed review. Members askedfor papers on three topics to be prepared for discussion. These are: i) Criteria for the design of gene-environment epidemiology studiesii) Areview of potential target genes for susceptibility to carcinogenesisiii) Areview of how gene-environment studies should be used in risk assessment process 3.35 These papers will be presented to the Committee for discussion in 2001. Risk procedures used by the Government's Advisory Committees dealing with food safety 3.36 COC was informed that, at the Prime Minister's request, Sir Robert May (then Chief Scientific Advisor to the Government) together with the ChiefMedical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson, and the Chairman of the FoodStandards Agency, Sir John Krebs, had carried out a review of risk proceduresin scientific committees that deal with food safety. The review group alsoincluded representatives of the devolved administrations and Dr JimMcQuaid, former Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Chief Scientist and 110Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentChairman of the Interdepartmental Liaison Group on Risk Assessment (ILGRA). The completed review outlined how the committees approachedrisk analysis and provided recommendations for best practice. 3.37 Members agreed that the role of COC predominately concerned hazard identification and risk assessment but not risk management. The Committeeagreed that it should focus its work on scientific considerations and it was notthe role of the Committee to consider policy options . 111Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentStatements of the COC Statement on Evidence for Association Between Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages and Breast Cancer : Update of Information Published Between 1995-1999 Statement on Carcinogenicity of 3-Monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD)Statement on Cancer Incidence Near Municipal Solid Waste Incinerators in Great Britain 112Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentSTATEMENT ON EVIDENCE FOR ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CONSUMPTION OFALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND BREASTCANCER: UPDATE OF INFORMATIONPUBLISHED BETWEEN 1995-1999 Introduction 1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the most common cause of cancer mortality in women. Each year there are approximately30,000 cases registered in England and approximately 11,000 deaths frombreast cancer. 1The aetiology of breast cancer is very complex (see paragraph 5 below). The most clearly established risk factors which are reproductive(eg age at first full term pregnancy, parity, age at menarche) offer limitedscope for prevention. The reason for the interest in further consideration ofthe association between alcohol and breast cancer is that even a small risk, ifcausally associated with alcohol, could have serious public healthimplications in terms of the number of breast cancer cases attributable todrinking alcoholic beverages. An extensive literature on the associationbetween alcohol and breast cancer was reviewed by the World HealthOrganisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1988 2and by this Committee in 19953but both groups were unable to establish a causal association between drinking alcoholic beverages and breast cancer. Thefactors which prevented definite conclusions from being drawn areconsidered in detail in a section of this statement. As a large number ofresearch publications have become available since 1995, including somerecent studies investigating the potential mechanism by which alcohol couldinduce breast cancer, it is now timely for the Committee to update itsassessment. Background to COC consideration Statement for the Interdepartmental Working Group on Alcohol (1995) 2. The Committee first considered the epidemiological evidence for an association between alcohol and breast cancer in 1995 at the request of theInterdepartmental Working Group (IDWG) on Sensible Drinking 4as part of the review of medical and scientific evidence and its interpretation of the longterm effects of drinking alcoholic beverages. The Committee provided a 113Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentstatement to the IDWG on the evidence for alcohol and cancer at all sites and concluded that drinking alcoholic beverages causes a dose-related increase inthe risk of squamous carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract as a whole,and for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus whichwas independent of the effect of smoking tobacco. There was a substantialamount of information available to members who were able to drawconclusions on dosimetry, duration and frequency of drinking alcoholicbeverages and the effect of abstinence and of smoking. 3 3. Asubstantial amount of research was available to the Committee on drinking alcoholic beverages and breast cancer in 1995. Members reviewed the 1988IARC monograph, which provides an evaluation of four large prospective and13 case-control studies. The Committee also reviewed seven additionalprospective studies, 5-1117 new case control studies12-28and two meta- analyses.29,30In addition a number of reviews of the available information were also considered.31-33The Committee agreed that the adequacy of control for confounding by known and/or alleged risk factors for breastcancer varied in the different accounts. Adose-related association wasreported in most cohort studies and in some hospital-based case-controlstudies. The results of population-based case-control studies did notgenerally support an association. Astatistically significant dose-relatedincrease in relative risk (RR) was reported in the two meta-analyses [RR at 3drinks/day 1.38 (95% CI 1.23-1.55)]. The Committee noted that the smallincreases in relative risk documented in epidemiological studies rangingbetween approximately 1.2-3 were associated with highly variable estimatesof consumption (ca 1-60g ethanol/day). It was agreed that clear evidence ofcausality had not been demonstrated. 3,4 4. The Committee concluded \"...that while there is no decisive evidence that breast cancer is causally related to drinking alcoholic beverages, the potentialsignificance, for public health, of even a weak association between alcoholand breast cancer is such that we recommend, in particular, that this matter bekept under review.\" 3The Interdepartmental Working Group endorsed the COC's conclusions and the recommendation that the relationship betweenalcohol and breast cancer should be kept under review. 4 Evaluation of epidemiological data on alcohol and breast cancer 5. The factors which may affect the adequacy and interpretation of any epidemiological studies, such as bias, confounding and errors of measurementhave been discussed in detail in the Committee's guidelines for the evaluationof chemicals for carcinogenicity. 34The assessment of the available epidemiological literature on drinking alcoholic beverages and breast cancer 114Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentis particularly difficult as the size of the relative risk estimates reported in the literature (ca 1-3) are within the range where it is difficult to exclude biasand/or confounding as explanations for the results. It is therefore important tohighlight the relevant factors of particular concern in interpreting studies ofdrinking alcoholic beverages. Estimating alcohol consumption data 6. The difficulty in obtaining an accurate drinking history is an important cause of the observed variation in estimates of the consumption of alcohol and ofrelative risks for breast cancer at particular levels of drinking alcoholicbeverages. Factors which affect the collection and interpretation of alcoholconsumption data include inaccurate recall of drinking alcoholic beverages,leading to under reporting, changes in drinking patterns over time, culturaland regional variations in drinking habits, and differences in quantifyingalcohol intakes between studies. The inadequate and inconsistentstratification of exposure groups further complicates the assessment ofepidemiological data. Confounding 7. Adequate measurement or control for confounding breast cancer risk factors is also difficult to achieve. Known risk factors for breast cancer include age,ethnic group, family history of the disease, age at birth of first child, atmenarche and at menopause, history of biopsy for benign breast disease,socio-economic status, obesity and, in premenopausal breast cancer, history oflactation. 1Other proposed risk factors have been cited, such as parity (in addition to age at birth of first child), use of oral contraceptives and hormonereplacement therapy. Introduction to current review 8. The Department of Health commissioned three discussion papers from its Toxicology Unit based at Imperial College of Science, Technology andMedicine to assist the Committee in its review. The first paper considered anupdate of the epidemiological literature from 1995 to March 1999 35and the second paper was a review of the evidence (up to June 1999) on possiblemechanism(s) by which drinking alcoholic beverages could induce breastcancer. 36The third paper was requested by the Committee following an initial consideration of the evidence on possible mechanisms, and presented atabulation of data on plasma and urinary sex hormones followingconsumption of alcohol. 37The full evaluation of confounding and the 115Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentdemonstration of a plausible mechanism between drinking alcoholic beverages and breast cancer would be significant steps towards establishing acausal relationship. Asummary of the literature reviewed in these papers isgiven below. 9. All of the information was evaluated in accordance with the Committee's guidelines 34and also with regard to the criteria proposed by Sir Austin Bradford-Hill.38 These latter criteria, which are listed below, are generally regarded as being valuable in the consideration as to whether or not anassociation between an outcome (in this case breast cancer) and a putativerisk factor (drinking alcoholic beverages) is causal. 39 Bradford-Hill criteria StrengthConsistencySpecificityTemporalityBiological gradientPlausibilityCoherenceExperimentAnalogy Objectives of current review 10. The primary objectives of the current COC review were: i) To update the assessment of breast cancer in relation to alcohol consumption; to assess this risk in relation to the level and type ofalcohol consumption; to examine any differences in risk betweenpremenopausal and postmenopausal women and/or between womenusing or not using exogenous hormones [oral contraceptives (OCs) andhormone replacement therapy (HRT)]. ii) To review the evidence relating to the mechanistic basis for an association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer. iii) To assess whether any association between alcohol consumption and the risk of breast cancer can be considered as causal. iv) If a conclusion regarding causality cannot be reached, to identify the nature of any additional research required to reach a definiteconclusion. 116Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentReview of new information Update on epidemiological evidence35 11. Three new prospective studies were identified in the DH Toxicology Unit discussion paper.40-42These investigations found a small but statistically significant association between drinking alcoholic beverages and increasedrisk of breast cancer and thus confirmed the findings of prospective studiesreviewed by the COC in 1995. Afurther 22 case-control studies werereported. 43-64Astatistically significant association between drinking alcoholic beverages and increased risk of breast cancer was reported in 17 of thesestudies with relative risks in drinkers estimated to be between 1.2 and 2.5. Adose-related trend for the association between drinking alcoholic beveragesand breast cancer was reported in the two cohort studies where this aspectwas considered 40,42and in the majority of the case-control studies reviewed.45,47,50,53,57,64Asignificant trend between increasing alcohol consumption and relative risk of breast cancer was documented in a pooledanalysis of six prospective studies. 65 The extent of correction for potential confounding risk factors varied between the different studies and a number ofdifferent methods for estimating alcohol consumption were used. An analysisof risks in pre menopausal and post menopausal women separately wasundertaken in nine case-control studies 43,45,46,48-50,59,62,64 and in one pooled analysis of six prospective studies65but no conclusions could be drawn regarding these data in view of the variation in quality and results betweenthe individual investigations. Other important variables, such as beveragetype and duration and frequency of drinking alcoholic beverages wereconsidered in a number of the epidemiology studies but no clear conclusionscould be drawn from the narrative review provided. Consideration of epidemiological data 12. The Committee noted that the DH Toxicology Unit had considered dose- response and duration of drinking alcoholic beverages and had come tosimilar conclusions to that reached by the COC in its 1995 review; namelythat there was evidence for an association between drinking alcoholicbeverages and breast cancer. Overall, there were no definitive data on aneffect of beverage type on relative risk and thus the authors had concludedthat most information pointed to an effect of alcohol itself rather than anycongeners or other ingredients. The Committee agreed that a morecomprehensive review of all the epidemiological data was required,particularly with respect to the quality assessment of the individualinvestigations, and suggested that the epidemiological papers should be 117Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentassessed for quality using a scoring method and that a formal systematic review, and where appropriate, meta-analyses of all the epidemiological datashould be undertaken. Two further epidemiological studies published after theDH Toxicology Unit report considered the evidence for a risk of breast cancerin premenopausal women. 66,67The Committee agreed that the results of these studies needed further consideration as part of the systematic review. Possible mechanisms for association between drinking alcoholic beverages and Breast Cancer36,37 13. The discussion paper drafted by the Department of Health Toxicology Unit identified sparse evidence for a number of potential mechanisms by whichalcohol could induce breast cancer including enhanced metabolism ofcarcinogens, 68-70increased cellular permeability to potential carcinogens,71 impaired immune responsiveness,72and abnormal differentiation of mammary tissue.73Afurther published paper presented a hypothesis that alcohol could induce tissue and DNAdamage via the formation of reactiveoxygen species in breast tissue. 74However, most of the available studies on mechanism examined the effects of drinking alcoholic beverages onoestrogen metabolism in humans. There was evidence from both cross-sectional and intervention studies that alcohol consumption affectedoestrogen metabolism in premenopausal 75,76and postmenopausal77-83 women. The mechanism by which alcohol affected oestrogen metabolismwas not readily apparent from these studies particularly in view of theevidence for confounding and interaction by other possible breast cancer riskfactors such as obesity, 77the use of oral contraceptives84and hormone replacement therapy.82One small study published after the DH Toxicology Unit review86provided evidence suggesting that among premenopausal women there may be a group which is more susceptible to the effect ofalcohol consumption on breast cancer, because of genetic differences inalcohol metabolism. The results obtained in this latter study need to beconfirmed before any definite conclusions can be reached. Consideration of potential mechanisms 14. The Committee agreed that there was now substantially more information on the potential effects of alcohol on oestrogen metabolism than was available in1995. However the interpretation was complex and it was requested that thedata be reviewed by an independent expert endocrinologist who would adviseon what effects alcohol might have on the metabolism of oestrogens inpremenopausal and postmenopausal women. Afurther discussion paper 37 prepared by the Department of Health Toxicology Unit was considered 118Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmenttogether with a submission from Professor H S Jacobs (Emeritus Professor of Reproductive Endocrinology, University College Medical School, London)who provided an oral assessment of the data to the Committee. TheCommittee agreed with Professor Jacobs that there was sufficient evidencefrom the available studies in humans to conclude that drinking alcoholicbeverages can elevate blood concentrations of oestrogens (particularlyoestradiol) and that the data concerning oestrogen-receptor status in breastcancer suggested a plausible link between alcohol consumption and anincreased risk of breast cancer. 85Overall the available data suggested a plausible mechanistic link between consumption of alcohol and breast cancermediated via an effect of alcohol on hormones. The interpretation of thesedata was particularly complicated and difficult; for example, the influence ofconfounding effects of other possible breast cancer risk factors such asobesity, use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy and theirpotential interaction with drinking alcoholic beverages needed to beconsidered carefully. 15. Some recent research has noted that the effects of alcohol on serum oestradiol concentrations occur in premenopausal women using oral contraceptives. 87 The Committee agreed that further epidemiological work should consider anumber of sub-groups, ie premenopausal women who either used or did notuse oral contraceptives and postmenopausal women who had or had not takenHRT. The Committee agreed that there were insufficient data available todescribe a threshold of action for alcohol-induced elevation in oestrogens. 16. The Committee agreed that it was important to consider carefully all the available evidence relating to potential mechanisms and therefore asked theCOM to update its conclusions, reached in 1995, on any new and relevantmutagenicity studies. Consideration of causality 17. The Committee felt it helpful to consider all the available evidence under the Bradford-Hill criteria which were outlined above in paragraph 9, in order toassess whether a definite conclusion on causality between drinking alcoholicbeverages and breast cancer can be reached and, if not, to use the criteria toidentify key areas where further work is required. An assessment of theavailable evidence has been tabulated as shown below. 119Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment120Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentCriterion Evidence Comments regarding alcohol and breast cancer Strength Limited. The RR in alcohol drinkers is modest and, even Magnitude of for heavy drinkers, rarely exceeds 3. However association is the RR for most other identified breast cancer small risk factors also rarely exceed this value. Consistency Limited. Under The available published meta-analysis by review. Longnecker MP 30reported significant heterogeneity. Areason for marked variation in results across studies was not found. The pooled analysis of prospective studies published by Smith-Warner SAet al 65found evidence of heterogeneity in results for premenopausal women but not postmenopausal women. There is a need for a further systematic review, using all studies available to date, to evaluate heterogeneity more fully. (ADH funded study is in progress). Specificity Not relevant. Cancer risk attributed to alcohol is not specific for breast cancer (e.g. prolonged alcohol consumption can induce cancers of the head and neck and oesophagus and liver). 3The mechanism for alcohol induced causation of these cancers is unknown but is unlikely to be related to that for breast cancer. Temporality Yes Association demonstrated in prospective studies where alcohol consumption can be studied before the occurrence of disease. Biological Limited. There is some evidence for a dose-response effect gradient Some evidence but the RR rarely exceeds 3 even in heavy drinkers. available Assessment of potential confounding and bias required to reach a conclusion on this criterion. Plausibility Yes Evidence for effect of alcohol consumption and elevations in blood levels of oestrogen metabolites (in particular oestradiol) documented. 36,37Raised oestradiol is a risk factor for breast cancer.39The evidence therefore suggests a plausible mechanism in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Coherence Limited Evidence for an increased risk of breast cancer in alcoholics 88and for a relatively low rate of breast cancer incidence among populations abstaining from alcohol (e.g. Mormons). 89Difficult to assess this criterion on these data. Experiment Limited. Some No evidence that alcohol is carcinogenic in evidence experimental animals.3Some evidence that alcohol available. affects breast tissue differentiation in animals.90 Analogy Yes Other causes of significantly increased oestradiol levels in exposed populations are suggested risk factors for breast cancer (e.g. use of oral contraceptives and HRT). 39 18. Taking all the available data into account there is evidence to satisfy three of the criteria (temporality, plausibility, and analogy) and some limited evidenceto satisfy a further four of the criteria (consistency, biological gradient,coherence, and experiment). The Committee agreed that there was noevidence that alcohol is carcinogenic from experimental studies in animals.The Committee considered that the criterion of specificity was not relevant tothe assessment of breast cancer risk. The Committee agreed that there wasconsiderable evidence to support an association between drinking alcoholicbeverages and increased risk of breast cancer but the magnitude of theassociation was small (ie the relative risk is modest and, even for heavydrinkers, rarely exceeds 3) and it was difficult to ascertain the nature of thedose-response relationship from the available information. The smallmagnitude of the association between drinking alcoholic beverages and riskof breast cancer and the complex aetiology (ie it is not specific to a single riskfactor) of breast cancer are the main reasons for the difficulty in reaching adefinite conclusion based on the Bradford-Hill criteria. The association couldbe due to biases in the studies or to confounding by other breast cancer riskfactors. 19. The Committee conclude that, in view of the difficulty in assessing the data on drinking alcoholic beverages and breast cancer, there is need for a rigoroussystematic review of the epidemiological literature using appropriate methods(ie meta-analysis) to identify and evaluate potential biases, confounding andheterogeneity so that an assessment of causality and risk associated withdrinking alcoholic beverages can be facilitated. The Committee agreed that itwould be important for any further analyses of the data to provide apopulation-attributable risk estimate for the UK. The Committeesubsequently agreed an outline proposal for a meta-analysis study preparedby a research team from Imperial College of Science, Technology andMedicine. The study has been commissioned by the Department of Healthand was initiated in December 1999. Adraft report should be available forscrutiny by the Committee in approximately 18 months time. The Committeewas also aware that additional relevant data on alcohol consumption and riskof breast cancer from the Oxford Collaborative Group on Hormonal factors inBreast Cancer would be forthcoming and should be reviewed when available. 121Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusions of current review 20. The Committee reached the following interim conclusions based on its updated review of the published literature since 1995. i) There is an association between drinking alcoholic beverages and increased risk of breast cancer. It is difficult to resolve whether this iscausal. The magnitude of the observed association is small (ie therelative risk is modest and, even for heavy drinkers, rarely exceeds 3)and within the range where it is difficult to exclude bias and/orconfounding as explanations for the observed results inepidemiological studies. It is difficult to derive a quantitativerelationship from the dose-response data available in the literature. ii) Further epidemiological studies have been published since 1995. There is a need for further systematic review of the epidemiological literatureto assess fully the influence of bias, confounding and effectmodification. This will contribute to a conclusion on causality andpopulation attributable risk associated with drinking alcoholicbeverages. iii) Studies of possible mechanisms provide evidence for a plausible basis for the causation of breast cancer by consumption of alcohol. Alcoholincreases blood levels of oestrogens and in particular oestradiol in bothpremenopausal and postmenopausal women. These data suggest asimilar mechanism to other known breast cancer risk factors. iv) The COM should be asked to update its opinion of 1995 on the mutagenicity data on alcohol.

These polyamine flocculants have been available for manyyears as approved products for use in water treatment and thus 3-MCPD maybe present in drinking water from their use. 3-MCPD is a member of a groupof contaminants known as chloropropanols. This group includes some knowngenotoxic carcinogens in animals such as 1,3-dichloropropan-2-ol. The COCwas asked to evaluate and advise on the available carcinogenicity data on 3-MCPD by the Committee on Chemicals and Materials of Construction for usein Public Water Supply and Swimming Pools (CCM), a statutory committeewhich provides advice to the Secretary of State for the Environment on theapproval of chemical substances in contact with public water supplies. 2. The Committee was aware that 3-MCPD had been detected as a contaminant of several foods and food ingredients, including acid hydrolysed vegetableprotein (acid-HVP) and that the EU Scientific Committee for Food hadpublished an opinion in 1994 where it was agreed that 3-MCPD should beregarded as a genotoxic carcinogen. 1The Committee also had access to published mutagenicity data on 3-MCPD, a safety evaluation prepared byCanTox. Inc (Ontario, Canada) for the International Hydrolysed ProteinCouncil, 2and a review document published by the Institute of Toxicology, National Food Agency of Denmark.3The COC asked for advice from the Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products andthe Environment (COM) in respect of the mutagenicity of 3-MCPD. Inreviewing these documents in 1999, members commented that the availablemetabolism data on 3-MCPD were relatively old and focused on metabolicpathways following intraperitoneal administration. There was no oral massbalance investigation available. The Committee considered the proposal byCanTox Inc regarding the formation of bacterial-specific mutagens andagreed that there was no evidence to support this speculation. However,additional in-vivomutagenicity data became available to the COM in 2000, namely a bone marrow micronucleus test and a rat liver UDS assay. Bothstudies were conducted to appropriate protocols and 3-MCPD was negative inboth studies. 132Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusions 3. The Committee has now reached the following conclusions on all the available mutagenicity and carcinogenicity data. i) 3-MCPD has a chemical structure which suggests that it may be metabolised to genotoxic intermediates (particularly glycidol). ii) The COM has advised that 3-MCPD is an in-vitromutagen but has no significant genotoxic potential in-vivo. (The COM statement on mutagenicity of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol has also been revised).The COM also noted that the predominant urinary metabolite in ratsfollowing dietary or intraperitoneal doses of 3-MCPD was beta-chlorolactic acid 4,(ie resulting from a pathway not producing glycidol or other genotoxic intermediates). Astudy has also shown that 3-MCPD may be also metabolised by a minor pathway and undergoconjugation with glutathione ultimately to form a mercapturic acid inurine of rats [N-acetyl-S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) cysteine]. 5 iii) 3-MCPD has been tested in four long-term animal carcinogenicity experiments, two in mice and two in rats.6-8However, three of these studies 6,7were conducted between 1970 and 1981 to inadequate protocols. The conclusions reached by the COC therefore refer to theone study conducted to contemporary standards. 8 The Committee had access to the full study report 8and to published reviews of this study.2,3The tumour data have been evaluated by a number of statistical methods. The analyses reported below refer to the Fisherspair-wise comparisons with controls. iv) In the study undertaken by Sunhara et al (1993) 83-MCPD was administered via drinking water to groups of 50 male and 50 femaleF344 rats (aged 6 weeks at study initiation) for a period of 104 weeks.Concentrations of 0, 20, 100, and 200 ppm were used. These equated todose levels of 0, 1.1, 5.2, or 28 mg/kg bw/day in males and 0, 1.4, 7.0,or 35 mg/kg bw/day in females. 3-MCPD was also detected in thedrinking water used in this study at 2.7 ppm and thus control animalswere given doses of approximately 0.1 mg/kg bw/day. The high dosegroup exceeded the Maximum Tolerated Dose as evidenced by adecrease in body weights relative to controls of 33% and 35% in malesand females respectively. There was no evidence of any treatment-related increase in mortality in this study. Survival to termination wasacceptable (ie >50%) in all dose groups with the exception of the malehigh dose group where 21/50 animals survived to termination. 133Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentv) In males, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of Leydig- cell adenoma was documented at the intermediate and high dose levels.Three animals at the high dose level had Leydig-cell carcinomas. Astatistically significant increase in the incidence of mammary glandfibroadenoma was noted in the high dose male group. Astatisticallysignificant increase in mammary gland hyperplasia was recorded in themale mid and high dose groups. Asmall but not statistically significantincrease in the incidence of preputial gland adenoma was recorded inthe mid and high dose male groups. One animal in the intermediatedose group and two in the high dose group had preputial glandcarcinomas. It is difficult to evaluate these findings since only a limitednumber of preputial glands were examined histologically (5-16/group)in this study. Asmall (not statistically significant) increase in renaltubular adenomas was documented in the intermediate and high dosemale groups. Astatistically significant increase in the incidence ofnephropathy and renal tubular hyperplasia was also recorded at theintermediate and high dose levels in this study. vi) In females, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of renal tubular adenoma was recorded at the high dose level. Astatisticallysignificant increase in nephropathy and renal tubular hyperplasia wasalso recorded at the intermediate and high dose levels in this study. Aslight but statistically non-significant increase in mammary glandhyperplasia was reported at the high dose level. vii) The Committee noted that tumours were reported in both sexes in the kidney and in males only at hormonally responsive sites (ie the testes,mammary gland and preputial gland) at dose levels which exceeded themaximum tolerated dose. Evidence from previously conductedinvestigations with 3-MCPD was considered in evaluating possibleexplanations for these findings. viii) In the kidney, the Committee noted that tumours in both sexes were benign (renal tubular adenoma) and that these were accompanied by achronic progressive nephropathy. In considering possible mechanisms,the Committee were aware of earlier findings that metabolism to beta-chlorolactic acid is a major pathway in the rat 4and that this metabolite is further broken down to yield oxalate and CO2. Oxalate is known to induce severe renal cytoxicity.3,9Other evidence, including a study which reported crystals of oxalate in the urine of rats treated with 3-MCPD (single dose of 100mg/kg ip), 4supported a role for sustained cytotoxicity as a possible mechanism for the induction of kidneytumours. The renal adenoma recorded in one female animal at thelowest dose was not considered to be biologically significant, and the 134Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentCommittee agreed that a dose of 1.1mg/kg bw/day was a no observed effect level for the induction of kidney tumours. The Committee,however, noted some evidence of a toxic effect upon the kidney at thisdose level (ie increased tubular hyperplasia and statistically significantincrease in absolute kidney weight). ix) With regard to the sex-specific tumours in male rats (in the testes, mammary preputial gland), the Committee noted that thetesticular tumours needed to be viewed against the high spontaneousincidence of Leydig-cell tumours common in ageing F344 rats, whichmay be up to 100% in control groups. 10,11The high proportion of Leydig cell adenoma (between 86% and 100% in treated animalgroups, compared to 76% in controls) was particularly noted in thisstudy. However, Leydig-cell carcinoma developed only at the highestdose in 3/50 treated animals. As 3-MCPD has been shown to induce aprolonged increase in circulating hormone levels [a singleintraperitoneal dose of 80mg/kg bw causing hormone (LH) andprolactin], 12it is possible that increases in the spontaneous rate of Leydig-cell tumours may have been promoted by hormonal imbalancecaused by 3-MCPD. Subsequently, the increase in tumours at otherhormonally responsive sites (ie in the male mammary gland and thepreputial gland) may be secondary to further hormonal disturbancesknown to be induced by proliferating Leydig cells. 2Overall, the Committee noted that there was no evidence of a significant increase intumourigenic response at any of these sites at a dose of 1.1 mg/kgbw/day. x) The Committee considered the suggestion that all of the increases in tumours noted in this study in rats were mediated by non-genotoxicmechanisms involving either cytotoxicity (kidney) or hormonaldisturbances. 2,3,8The possible influence of the stereoisomerism of 3- MCPD was also discussed. Members agreed that the proposed non-genotoxic mechanisms advanced were plausible, now that specificevidence was available that reactive metabolites were not producedin-vivoin tissues where genotoxicity was assessed. xi) The Committee concluded that the no observed effect level (NOEL) for tumourigenic effects of 3-MCPD in rats was approximately 1.1mg/kgbw/day. xii) The Committee agreed that an approach utilising the NOELwith appropriate uncertainty factors would be acceptable for carcinogenicrisk assessment for 3-MCPD. An overall uncertainty factor of 1000 135Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentwas considered appropriate in view of the uncertainties identified in the data, particularly in respect of the quality and incompleteness of themetabolic data on 3-MCPD. xiii) The Committee concluded that 3-MCPD was unlikely to present a carcinogenic risk to man, provided the exposure was 1000 times lowerthan the NOELof 1.1mg/kg bw/d for on 3-Monochloropropane 1,2-diol (3-MCPD).

There have been very few epidemiological studies published which investigated cancer incidence or mortality amongst individuals living in proximity toincinerators in Great Britain. 1,2The COC was asked during 1993-4 to comment on a study undertaken by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) whichinvestigated the cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near to 72solid waste incinerators. This investigation had been initiated following thepublication of several reviews of the potential health risks associated withincineration which highlighted the lack of appropriate epidemiologicalinvestigations of cancer risk. 1, 3,4and was published in the scientific literature in 1996.5However, before drawing any conclusions on the SAHSU study, the Committee requested further information in respect of the data on liver cancer;namely a histopathological and case-note review of primary liver cancer cases.The Committee considered the report of this latter investigation during 1998and at its March 1999 meeting. This statement presents some backgroundinformation on municipal solid waste incineration in the UK, a review of theSAHSU investigations of cancer incidence near to municipal solid wasteincinerators and conclusions reached by the Committee regarding the risk ofcancer associated with living near to municipal incinerators. Municipal solid waste incineration in the UK 2. According to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), currently around 26 million tonnes of municipal waste is produced inthe UK each year; around 10% of which is disposed via incineration. In the UKall municipal waste incinerators (MWIs) are regulated by the EnvironmentAgency or local authorities. Since 1 December 1996, all MWIs have beenrequired to meet the standards in the Municipal Waste Incineration Directives89/369/EEC and 89/429/EEC and this resulted in the closure of the majority ofthe existing incinerators and the upgrading of the remainder. Adioxin emissionlimit of 1 nanogram per cubic metre (ng m -3) was imposed at the same time although, in practice, most existing plants already achieve dioxin emissionsclose to 0.1 ng m -3. There are currently 11 MWIs in operation in the UK, with another due to start operating in 2000. The Committee was informed that thereis expected to be a significant increase in UK incinerator capacity over the next10-20 years to meet the requirements of the proposed EC Landfill Directivewhich sets limits for the percentage of biodegradable waste which may be 138Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentlandfilled (it has been estimated that a further 16 MWIs may be required by 2006).6However, the draft Waste Incineration Directive currently being discussed within the EU seeks to reduce further emissions of key pollutantsfrom incineration processes, including particulates, dioxins, and heavy metals. SAHSU studies of municipal solid waste incinerators. A. 1996 Investigation of health statistics 3. The cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near to 72 municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain was examined from 1974-1986(England), 1974-1984 (Wales), and 1975-1987 (Scotland). 1The study was conducted in two stages: the first involved a stratified sample of 20incinerators and the second considered the remaining 52 incinerators. Overallthere was a statistically significant decline in risk with distance fromincinerators for all cancers combined and for stomach, colorectal, liver andlung cancers. The excess risk in people living within 1 km of a MWI for thesecancers after allowing for a 10 year lag period, was estimated from thesecond stage investigation to vary from 5% (colorectal) to 37% (liver; 0.95excess cases 10 -5year-1). SAHSU estimated a total of 23 excess cases of liver cancer in the 0-1 km zone from the second stage of the analysis. There wasevidence of residual confounding which the authors suggested was a likelyexplanation for the findings for all cancers, stomach and lung, and also toexplain at least part of the excess of liver cancer. For this reason and becauseof the substantial level of misdiagnosis (mainly secondary tumours) believedto occur among registrations and death certificates for liver cancer, the COCasked for a further investigation. This was to comprise a histological reviewof the liver cancer cases identified in the first study, in order to determinewhether or not an increase in primary liver cancer had occurred. B. Histological and case-note review of primary liver cancer cases 4. This diagnostic histopathological and case-note review considered 235 cases (155 males, 80 females) registered with primary liver cancer and included all87 cases within 1km of a MWI, and random samples of 74 cases from 1-7.5km and 74 from the rest of Great Britain. Diagnostic material was availablefor 94 cases (of which 26 also had clinical notes available) and medicalrecords only were available for 25 additional cases. Histopathological slideswere reviewed independently by three pathologists and any discrepanciesresolved at case conferences. The medical records were reviewedindependently by one senior clinician. 139Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment5. Primary liver cancer was confirmed in 66/119 cases (55%, 95% CI 46-64%) while 21 cases (18%; 95% CI 11-24%) were considered to be definitesecondary cancers. The remaining cases could not be distinguished betweenprimary and secondary cancers (26 cases) or no malignant tissue was found inthe specimens available (6 cases). There was no evidence to suggest that theproportion of cases confirmed as having primary liver cancer, nor of thosewith evidence of cirrhosis and associated risk factors, differed with distancefrom incinerators. The Committee agreed that the confirmation of 55% ofregistered primary liver cancer cases following diagnostic review, is inaccordance with a previous study in Great Britain. 7The Committee agreed that the finding of a high concordance between cancer registration and deathcertificate data for the confirmed primary liver cancer cases (80%) wasunexpected but important new information which suggested that the use ofdeath certificates was acceptable in epidemiological investigations of livercancer. 6. Two cases of angiosarcoma were diagnosed on histopathological review within 7.5 km of a MWI (cf 0.26 expected based on a national register(p<0.05)), but there was no evidence more generally of clustering nearincinerators of cases ascribed to angiosarcoma in a national register. Neither ofthese two cases had been diagnosed previously, both being registered ashepatocellular carcinoma, and neither was an industrial case. The Committeenoted that there was no background information on the extent to whichangiosarcoma was misdiagnosed routinely as hepatocellular carcinoma orcarcinoma (not otherwise specified) in the general population. The Committeeagreed that SAHSU had adopted an acceptable approach to the evaluation ofthe significance of the two cases of angiosarcoma given the limitations in thenational register data used. 7. The histopathology diagnostic review allows a range of estimates to be made of possible (absolute) excess of \"true\" primary liver cancer near incinerators,based on relative risk estimates from the previous study. Assuming thatprimary liver cancer was the correct diagnosis in 55% of all registered casesthen the excess number of cases among the population living within 1 km ofan incinerator is reduced from 23 to 12.6, i.e. an excess of 0.53 excess cases10 -5year-1. With only definite secondary cancer cases excluded (18%) then the excess within 1km is reduced to 18.8 cases, ie 0.78 excess cases 10-5year-1. 8 140Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentCOC evaluation of SAHSU studies 8. The Committee was informed that there have been considerable reductions in the levels of emissions of pollutants from incinerators in recent years. TheRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution recognised thatepidemiological studies are much less likely to reveal any health effects inrelation to current standards of controls on emission of pollutants fromMWIs. 1Thus estimates of the relative risk derived from the SAHSU investigations would, if causally associated with exposure to emissions, berelated to accumulated exposures prior to the introduction of the controlsimplemented through the 1989 Municipal Waste Incineration Directives. 9. The Committee agreed that there were a number of factors that should be considered in deriving conclusions on the SAHSU studies of MWIs: i)accuracy of health statistics, ii) accuracy of cancer diagnosis, iii) potentialconfounding factors for individual cancers, and iv) a number ofenvironmental variables particular to incineration such as type of waste burnt,geographical and meteorological conditions, and controls placed on theemission of pollutants. 10. With regard to the 1996 study of cancer incidence, the Committee agreed that the excess of all cancers, stomach, lung and colorectal cancers were due tosocio-economic confounding as has been reported by the SAHSU groupfollowing adjustment of the data by use of a deprivation index. Post-hocanalyses which compared cancer incidence prior to establishment of anincinerator with cancer incidence following a 10 year lag period since firstexposure was consistent with this conclusion. 11. With regard to the diagnostic histopathology study of liver cancer, the Committee agreed that whilst the excess of primary liver cancer nearincinerators was not readily explained by known confounding or otherfactors, residual confounding by socio-economic factors could not beexcluded in view of the strong association of deprivation with liver cancerincidence. 141Annual report 2000 Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusions 12. The Committee agreed the following overall conclusions with respect to the SAHSU investigations of cancer incidence near MWIs: i) The SAHSU studies found a small excess of primary liver cancer near municipal solid waste incinerators (estimated to be between 0.53-0.78excess cases 10 -5year-1). It is not possible to conclude that this small increase in primary liver cancer is due to emissions of pollutants fromincinerators, as residual socio-economic confounding cannot beexcluded. The Committee agreed that an excess of all cancers,stomach, lung and colorectal cancers was due to socio-economicconfounding and was not associated with emissions from incinerators. ii) The finding of two cases of angiosarcoma during the histopathology review in individuals who were resident within 7.5 km of a municipalsolid waste incinerator was unexpected. The Committee consideredthat the evaluation of this finding was difficult given the limitations inthe registration of angiosarcoma and lack of information regardingaccuracy of diagnosis in the general population. The Committee,however, agreed that there was no evidence more generally ofclustering near incinerators of cases ascribed to angiosarcoma in anational register. iii) The Committee was reassured that any potential risk of cancer due to residency (for periods in excess of 10 years) near to municipal solidwaste incinerators was exceedingly low and probably not measurableby the most modern epidemiological techniques. The Committeeagreed that, at the present time, there was no need for any furtherepidemiological investigations of cancer incidence near municipalsolid waste incinerators.

The Ministers of the sponsoring departments are answerable to Parliament for the policies and performance of this Committee, including the policy framework withinwhich it operates. Standards in Public Life All Committee members must: follow the Seven Principles of Public Life set out by the Committee onStandards in Public Life (see below); comply with this Code, and ensure they understand their duties, rightsand responsibilities, and that they are familiar with the function androle of this Committee and any relevant statements of Governmentpolicy. If necessary members should consider undertaking relevanttraining to assist them in carrying out their role; not misuse information gained in the course of their public service forpersonal gain or for political purpose, nor seek to use the opportunityof public service to promote their private interests or those ofconnected persons, firms, businesses or other organisations; and 150Annual report 2000not hold any paid or high profile unpaid posts in a political party, and not engage in specific political activities on matters directly affectingthe work of this Committee. When engaging in other politicalactivities, Committee members should be conscious of their public roleand exercise proper discretion. These restrictions do not apply to MPs(in those cases where MPs are eligible to be appointed), to localcouncillors, or to Peers in relation to their conduct in the House ofLords. Role of Committee members Members have collective responsibility for the operation of this Committee. Theymust: engage fully in collective consideration of the issues, taking account ofthe full range of relevant factors, including any guidance issued by theFood Standards Agency; the Department of Health and sponsordepartments or the responsible Minister; in accordance with Government policy on openness, ensure that theyadhere to the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information(including prompt responses to public requests for information); agreean Annual Report; and, where practicable and appropriate, providesuitable opportunities to open up the work of the Committee to publicscrutiny; not divulge any information which is provided to the Committee inconfidence; ensure that an appropriate response is provided to complaints and othercorrespondence, if necessary with reference to the sponsor department;and ensure that the Committee does not exceed its powers or functions. Individual members should inform the Chairman (or the Secretariat on his or her behalf) if they are invited to speak in public in their capacity as a Committeemember. Communications between the Committee and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) Board and /or Ministers will generally be through the Chairman except where theCommittee has agreed that an individual member should act on its behalf.Nevertheless, any member has the right of access to the FSABoard and/or Ministers 151Annual report 2000on any matter that he or she believes raises important issues relating to his or her duties as a Committee member. In such cases the agreement of the rest of theCommittee should normally be sought. Individual members can be removed from office by the FSABoard if they fail to perform the duties required of them in line with the standards expected in publicoffice. The role of the Chairman The Chairman has particular responsibility for providing effective leadership on theissues above. In addition, the Chairman is responsible for: ensuring that the Committee meets at appropriate intervals, and that theminutes of meetings and any reports to the FSABoard accuratelyrecord the decisions taken and, where appropriate, the views ofindividual members; representing the views of the Committee to the general public; and ensuring that new members are briefed on appointment (and theirtraining needs considered), and providing an assessment of theirperformance, on request, when members are considered for re-appointment to the Committee or for appointment to the board of someother public body. Handling conflicts of interests The purpose of these provisions is to avoid any danger of Committee membersbeing influenced, or appearing to be influenced, by their private interests in theexercise of their public duties. All members should declare any personal or businessinterest which may, or may be perceived (by a reasonable member of the public) to, influence their judgement. Aguide to the types of interest that should be declared isbelow. (i) Declaration of Interests to the Secretariat Members of the Committee should inform the Secretariat in writing of their currentpersonal and non-personal interests, when they are appointed, including theprincipal position(s) held. Only the name of the company and the nature of theinterest are required; the amount of any salary etc. need not be disclosed. An 152Annual report 2000interest is current if the member has an on-going financial involvement with industry, eg if he or she holds shares in industry, has a consultancy contract, or if themember or the department for which he or she is responsible is in the process ofcarrying out work for industry. Members are asked to inform the Secretariat at anytime of any change of their personal interests and will be invited to complete adeclaration form once a year. It is sufficient if changes in non-personal interests arereported in the annual declaration form following the change. (Non-personalinterests involving less than \u00a31,000 from a particular company in the previous yearneed not be declared to the Secretariat). The register of interests should be kept up-to-date and be open to the public. (ii) Declaration of Interest and Participation at Meetings Members of the Committee are required to declare any direct interests relating to salaried employment or consultancies, or those of close family members,1in matters under discussion at each meeting. Having fully explained the nature of their interestthe Chairman will, having consulted the other members present, decide whether andto what extent the member should participate in the discussion and determination ofthe issue. If it is decided that the member should leave the meeting, the Chairmanmay first allow them to make a statement on the item under discussion. Personal liability of Committee members ACommittee member may be personally liable if he or she makes a fraudulent ornegligent statement which results in a loss to a third party; or may commit a breachof confidence under common law or a criminal offence under insider dealinglegislation, if he or she misuses information gained through their position.However, the Government has indicated that individual members who have actedhonestly, reasonably, in good faith and without negligence will not have to meet outof their own personal resources any personal civil liability which is incurred inexecution or purported execution of their Committee functions save where theperson has acted recklessly. To this effect a formal statement of indemnity has beendrawn up. 153Annual report 2000 1Close family members include personal partners, parents, children, brothers, sisters and the personal partners of any of these.Annex 1 THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC LIFE 154Annual report 2000 Selflessness Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest.They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits forthemselves, their family, or their friends. Integrity Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or otherobligation to outside individuals or organisations that might influence them in theperformance of their official duties. Objectivity In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awardingcontracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of publicoffice should make choices on merit. Accountability Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions to thepublic and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to theiroffice. Openness Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions andactions that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrictinformation only when the wider public interest clearly demands. Honesty Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to theirpublic duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way thatprotects the public interests. Leadership Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by leadershipand example.Annex 2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTEREST The following is intended as a guide to the kinds of interests that should be declared. Where members are uncertain as to whether an interest should be declared they shouldseek guidance from the Secretariat or, where it may concern a particular product whichis to be considered at a meeting, from the Chairman at that meeting. If members have interests not specified in these notes but which they believe could be regarded asinfluencing theiradvice they should declare them. However, neither the members nor the Secretariat are under any obligation to search out links of which they mightreasonably not be aware. For example, either through not being aware of all the interests of family members, or of not being aware of links between one company and another. Personal Interests Apersonal interest involves the member personally. The main examples are: Consultancies and/ordirect employment any consultancy, directorship, position in or work for industry which attracts regular oroccasional payments in cash or kind; Fee-Paid Work : any commissioned work by industry for which the member is paid in cash or kind; Shareholdings : any shareholding or other beneficial interest in shares of industry. This does not include shareholdings through unit trusts orsimilar arrangements where the member has no influence on financialmanagement; Non-Personal Interests Anon-personal interest involves payment which benefits a department for which amember is responsible, but is not received by the member personally. The mainexamples are: Fellowships : the holding of a fellowship endowed by industry; Support by Industry : any payment, other support or sponsorship which does not convey any pecuniary or material benefit to a memberpersonally, but which does benefit their position or department eg: 155Annual report 2000i) a grant for the running of a unit or department for which a member is responsible; ii) a grant or fellowship or other payment to sponsor a post or a member of staff or a post graduate research programme in the unit for which amember is responsible. This does not include financial assistance forstudents; iii) the commissioning of research or other work by, or advice from, staff who work in a unit for which the member is responsible. Members are under no obligation to seek out knowledge of work done for, or on behalf of, the industry or other relevant bodies by departments for which they areresponsible, if they would not normally expect to be informed. Trusteeships : where a member is a trustee of a charity with investments in industry, the Secretariat can agree with the member a generaldeclaration to cover this interest rather than draw up a detailedportfolio. DEFINITIONS In this Code, 'the industry'means: Companies, partnerships or individuals who are involved with theproduction, manufacture, sale or supply of products subject to thefollowing legislation; The Food Safety Act 1990 The Medicines Acts 1968 and 1971The Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985The Consumer Protection Act 1987The Cosmetic (Safety) (Amendment) Regulations 1987The Notification of New Substances Regulations 1982 Trade associations representing companies involved with such products; Companies, partnerships or individuals who are directly concerned withresearch, development or marketing of a product which is beingconsidered by the Committees on Toxicity, Mutagenicity, orCarcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and theEnvironment. In this Code 'the Secretariat'means the Secretariat of the COT/COM/COC. 156Annual report 2000ANNEX 3 OPENNESS Introduction 1. The Committee on Toxicity (COT) and its sister committees the Committee on Mutagenicity (COM) and Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC) are non-statutory independent advisory committees who advise the Chief MedicalOfficer and the Chairman of the Food Standards Agency and, through them,the Government on a wide range of matters concerning chemicals in food,consumer products and the environment. 2. The Government is committed to make the operation of advisory committees such as the COT/COM/COC more open and to increase accountability.Proposals have been published in \"Quangos-Opening the Doors\" (CabinetOffice, July 1998). The COT/COM/COC have recently considered a numberof options for greater openness of Committee business. There was a highlevel of agreement between the COT/COM/COC regarding the adoption ofproposals for greater openness. 3. In discussing these proposals (during the course of 1999) the Committees were aware that the disclosure of information which is of a confidentialnature and was communicated in circumstances importing an obligation ofconfidence is subject to the common law of confidentiality. Guidance is setout in the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (secondedition, 1997). Thus an important aspect of implementing initiatives forgreater openness of Committee business concerns setting out clear guidelinesfor the handling of information submitted on a confidential basis. General procedures for openness 4. The Committees agreed that the publication of agendas, finalised minutes, agreed conclusions and statements (subject to the adoption of appropriateprocedures for handling commercially sensitive information) andappointment of a lay/public interest member to each Committee would helpto increase public scrutiny of Committee business. The Committees alsoagreed that additional open meetings on specific topics where interest groups,consumer organisations etc could attend and participate should be held. 5. Asummary of the proposals is tabulated below. Amore detailed outline of procedures regarding products where confidential data has been reviewed isgiven in paragraphs 11-13. 157Annual report 20006. The Committees stressed that, in view of the highly technical nature of the discussions, there was a need for all documents released to be finalised andagreed by the Committee, ie any necessary consultation with Members andChairman should be completed before disclosure. 7. Statements and conclusions should summarise all the relevant data, such as information regarding potential hazards/risks for human health in respect ofthe use of products and chemicals, and any recommendations for furtherresearch. 8. The Committees will be asked for an opinion based on the data available at the time of consideration. It is recognised that, for many chemicals, thetoxicological information is incomplete and that recommendations for furtherresearch to address these gaps will form part of the Committee's advice. 9. The release of documents (papers, minutes, conclusions and statements) where the COT/COM/COC has agreed an opinion on the available data butwhere further additional information is required in order to finalise theCommittee's conclusions, needs to be considered on a case-by case basis. Therelevant considerations include the likelihood that such additional data wouldalter the Committee's conclusion, any representations made by a companyabout, for example, commercial harm that early disclosure could cause andalso the public interest in disclosure. 10. In the event that the Committees need to consider an item over several meetings, it might be necessary to keep relevant documents (eg papers andminutes) confidential until an agreed opinion (eg statement) is available. 158Annual report 2000Summary of proposals for committee openness. (* Procedures for handling confidential information outlined in paras 11-13 below) Procedures for handling confidential information Background 11. COT/COM/COC quite often consider information which has been supplied in confidence. For the most part this comprises information which iscommercially sensitive. For example, this could include productformulations/specifications, methods of manufacture, and reports oftoxicological investigations and company evaluations and safety assessments. 12. Normal procedure in the past has been to publish a summary of the Committee's advice in the Annual Report and to ask companies to release fullcopies of submitted reports for retention by the British Library at thecompletion of a review. Given the clear Ministerial commitment to the 159Annual report 2000 Issue Proposals Comment Open meetings on Agreed. Suggestions Meetings would be on specified topics (eg invited include meeting at time of genetic issues in chemical audience, interest groups, release of Annual Report. toxicology, carcinogenicity, consumer organisations, External consultation on mutagenicity and risk professional societies). identifying topics for such assessment. There would be meetings. no discussion of individual commercial products. Agenda Agreed Made publicly available via Internet site prior to meeting. Papers Agreed Finalised papers to be made available upon request. Confidential information/ annexes to be removed. Minutes* Agreed Anonymised minutes made available upon request and on Internet site after appropriate consultation with members and agreement by the full committee. Conclusions/statements* Agreed Agreed conclusions/ statements published as appropriate including via the Internet and also made available on request. Annual Report* Agreed Publish in accordance with procedures for previous years.publication of detailed information regarding the activities of advisory committees, and in particular following the assessment of products which arealready available to the general public, the COT/COM/COC have begun toadopt where possible a more open style of business where detailed statementshave been published via the Internet soon after they have been finalised. 13. Except in cases where there is legislation under which information has been submitted and which deals with disclosure and non-disclosure, the generalprinciple of the common law duty of confidentiality will apply. This meansthat any information which is of a confidential character and has beenobtained in circumstances importing a duty of confidence may not bedisclosed unless consent has been given or there is an overriding publicinterest in disclosure (such as the prevention of harm to others). Thefollowing procedure will be adopted which allows confidential information tobe identified, assessed and appropriate conclusions/statements to be draftedand published on the basis of a prior mutual understanding with thecompanies. There is scope for companies to make representations also aftersubmission of the information and prior to publication regarding thecommercial sensitivity of data supplied and to comment on the text ofstatements which are to be published. However, companies would not have aright of veto in respect of such statements. Procedures prior to committee consideration Initial discussions Upon referral to COT/COM/COC the Secretariat will liaise with the relevant company supplying the product in the UK to: i) Clearly state the policy of Committee openness (as summarised above).ii) To identify and request the information needed by the COT/COM/COC (eg test reports, publications etc). Confidential data iii) The company will be asked to clearly identify any confidential data and the reason for confidentiality. 160Annual report 2000Handling confidential data iv) The procedures by which the COT/COM/COC will handle confidential data and the public availability of papers, minutes, conclusions andstatements where reference is made to such data will be discussed withthe company prior to submission of papers to the Committee(s). Thegeneral procedures for handling documents are outlined in paragraphs4-10 above. Companies will be informed that confidential annexes toCommittee papers (eg where detailed information supplied inconfidence such as individual patient information and full study reportsof toxicological studies) will not be disclosed but that otherinformation will be disclosed unless agreed otherwise with anindividual company. v) The following is a suggested list of information which might be disclosed in COT/COM/COC documents (papers, minutes, conclusionsand statements). The list is not exhaustive and is presented as a guide. a) name of product (or substance/chemical under consideration), b) information on physico-chemical properties,c) methods of rendering harmless,d) a summary of the results and evaluation of the results of tests to establish harmlessness to humans, e) methods of analysis,f) first aid and medical treatment to be given in the case of injury to persons. g) surveillance data (eg monitoring for levels in food, air, or water). Procedures during and after Committee consideration vi) The timing of release of Committee documents (papers, minutes, conclusions and statements) where the item of business involved theconsideration of confidential data would be subject to the generalprovisions outlined in paragraphs 4-10 above. Documents would not bereleased until a Committee - agreed conclusion or statement wasavailable. vii) The most important outcome of the Committee consideration is likely to be the agreed statement. Companies will be given an opportunity tocomment on the statement prior to publication and to make 161Annual report 2000representations (for example, as to commercial sensitivities in the statement). The Chairman would be asked to consider any commentsprovided, but companies would not be able to veto the publication of astatement or any part of it. Companies will continue to be asked torelease full copies of submitted reports for retention by the BritishLibrary at the completion of a review. 162Annual report 2000ANNEX 4 GLOSSARY OF TERMS ACUTE Describes a disease of rapid onset, severe symptoms and brief duration. ACUTE TOXICITY Effects that occur over a short period of time (hours or few days) immediately following exposure. ADDUCT Achemical grouping which is covalently bound (strong bond formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons) to alarge molecule such as DNA(qv) or protein. Ah RECEPTOR The Ah (Aromatic hydrocarbon) receptor protein regulates gene expression. The identity of the naturalendogenous chemical which bind to the Ah receptor areunknown. Arange of chemicals such as chlorinateddibenzodioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls bind toAh receptor. The available research suggests thatbinding to the Ah receptor is an integral part of thetoxicological mechanism of these compounds. ALANINE An enzyme that, when elevated activity is detected in AMINOTRANSFERASE serum, may indicate damage to certain organs. ALKYLATING AGENTS Chemicals which leave an alkyl group covalently bound to biologically important molecules such as DNA(see adduct). Many alkylating aremutagenic, carcinogenic and immunosuppressive. TEST In vitro(qv) assay for bacterial gene mutations (qv) using strains of Salmonella typhimurium developed by Ames and his colleagues. ANEUGENIC Inducing aneuploidy (qv).ANEUPLOIDY The circumstances in which the total number of chromosomes within a cell is not an exact multiple ofthe normal haploid (see 'polyploidy') number.Chromosomes may be lost or gained during celldivision. 163Annual report 2000ASPARTATE An enzyme that, when elevated activity is detected in AMINOTRANSFERASE serum, may indicate damage to certain organs. ASSAY Aprocedure for measurement or identification.B6C3F1 MICE a particular strain of mice.BIAS An inference which at any stage of an epidemiological investigation tends to produce results that departsystemically from the true values (to be distinguishedfrom random error). The term does not necessarilycarry an imputation of prejudice or any other subjectivefactor such as the experimenter's desire for a particularoutcome. \u00df-ISOMER Isomers are two or more chemical compounds with the same molecular formula but having different propertiesowing to a different arrangement of atoms within themolecule. The \u00df-isomer of alitame is formed when thecompound degrades and the atoms within the moleculeare rearranged. BIOAVAILABILITY Aterm referring to the proportion of a substance which reaches the systemic circulation unchanged after aparticular route of administration. BIOMARKER Areadily measurable biological concentration or similar quantity which acts as a surrogate for abiological effect. BRADFORD - Sir Bradford-Hill established criteria that have been HILLCRITERIA universally used to assist in the interpretation of associations reported from studies:- STRENGTH - The stronger the association the more likely it is causal. The COC has previously noted that the relative risks of<3need careful assessment foreffects of bias or confounding. CONSISTENCY- The association has been consistently identified by studies Using different approaches and is also seen indifferent populations with exposureto the chemical under consideration. 164Annual report 2000SPECIFICITY- Limitation of the association to specific exposure groups or to specific types ofcancers increases likelihood that the association iscausal. TEMPORALITY- The association must demonstrate that exposure leads to cancer. Therelationship of time since first exposure, duration ofexposure and time since last exposure are allimportant in assessing casuality. BIOLOGICALGRADIENT- If an association reveals a biological gradient or dose-reponse curve,then this evidence is of particular importance inassessing causality. PLAUSIBILITY- Is there appropriate data to suggest a mechanism by which exposure could leadto concern? However, even if an observedassociation may be new to science or medicine itshould not be dismissed. COHERENCE - Cause and effect interpretation of data should not seriously conflict with generallyknown facts. EXPERIMENT- Can the association be demonstrated. Evidence from experimental animalsmay assist in some cases. Evidence that removal ofthe exposure leads to a decrease in risk may berelevant. ANALOGY- Have other closely related chemicals been associated with cancer. BRONCHIAL Relating to the air passages conducting air from the trachea (windpipe) to the lungs. CARCINOGENICITY Tests carried out in laboratory animals, usually rats and BIOASSAY mice, to determine whether a substance is carcinogenic. The test material is given, usually in the diet,throughout life to groups of animals, at different doselevels. 165Annual report 2000CARCINOGENESIS The origin, causation and development of tumours. The term applies to all forms of tumours, benign as well asmalignant (see 'tumour') and not just to carcinomas(qv). CARCINOGENS The causal agents which induce tumours. They include external factors (chemicals, physical agents, viruses)and internal factors such as hormones. Chemicalcarcinogens are structurally diverse and includenaturally-occurring substances as well as syntheticcompounds. An important distinction can be drawnbetween genotoxic (qv) carcinogens which have been shown to react directly with and mutate DNA, and non- genotoxic carcinogens which act through other mechanisms. The activity of genotoxic carcinogens canoften be predicted from their chemical structure - eitherof the parent compound or of activated metabolites(qv). Most chemical carcinogens exert their effectsafter prolonged exposure, show a dose-responserelationship and tend to act on a limited range ofsusceptible target tissues. Carcinogens are sometimesspecies- or sex-specific and the term should be qualifiedby the appropriate descriptive adjectives to aid clarity.Several different chemical and other carcinogens mayinteract, and constitutional factors (geneticsusceptibility, hormonal status) may also contribute,emphasising the multifactorial nature of thecarcinogenic process. CARCINOMA Malignant tumour arising from epithelial cells lining, for example, the alimentary, respiratory and urogenitaltracts and from epidermis, also from solid viscera suchas the liver, pancreas, kidneys and some endocrineglands. (See also 'tumour'). CASE-CONTROL (Synonyms - case comparison study, case referent STUDY study). Astudy that starts with the identification of persons with the disease of interest and a suitablecontrol group of persons without the disease. Therelationship of some attribute to the disease (such asoccupational exposure to a carcinogen) is examined bycomparing the disease and nondiseased with regard tohow frequently the attribute is implicated in each of thegroups. 166Annual report 2000CELLS IN CULTURE Cells which have been isolated from animals and grown in the laboratory. CELL See Transformation. TRANSFORMATION ASSAY CENTRILOBULAR Vacuolation of cells surrounding the central vein in a HEPATOCYTE liver lobule.VACUOLISATION CHROMOSOME Collective term of particular types of chromosome ABERRATION damage induced after exposure to exogenous chemical or physical agents which damage the DNA. (seeclastogen). CHRONIC Describing a disease of long duration involving very slow changes. Such disease is often of gradual onset.The term does not imply anything about the severity ofthe disease. CLASTOGEN An agent that produces chromosome breaks and other structural aberrations such as translocations (qv).Clastogens may be viruses or physical agents as well aschemicals. Clastogenic events play an important part inthe development of some tumours. COHORT Adefined population.COHORTSTUDY (Synonyms - follow-up, longitudinal, prospective study) The method of epidemiological study in whichsubsets of a defined population can be identified whomay be exposed to a factor or factors hypothesized toinfluence the probability of occurrence of a givendisease. An essential feature of the method isobservation of the population for a sufficient number ofperson-years to generate reliable incidence or mortalityrates in the population subsets. This generally impliesstudy of a large population and/or study for a prolongedperiod of time. CONGENER Compounds varying in chemical structure but with similar biological properties. 167Annual report 2000COVALENT The type of binding formed by the sharing of an electron pair between two atoms. Molecules arecombinations of atoms bound together by covalentbonds. CYTOCHROME Haem proteins that catalyse electron transfer reactions. Cytochrome P450 is a collective term for an extensivefamily of haem proteins involved in enzymic oxidationof a wide range of substances and their conversion toforms that are more easily excreted. In some cases themetabolites produced may be reactive and may havecarcinogenic potential. CYTOGENETIC Concerning chromosomes, their origin, structure and function. DELETION Usually a chromosome aberration in which a proportion of a chromosome is lost. DIETARYREFERENCE Aterm used to cover LRNI (qv), RNI (qv) and safe VALUE (DRV) intake. DNA The carrier of genetic information for all living (DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC organisms except the group of RNAviruses. Each of ACID) the 46 chromosomes in normal human cells consists of 2 strands of DNAcontaining up to 100,000 nucleotides,specific sequences of which make up genes (qv).

As thechromosomes are most easily examined in metaphase,cells are arrested at this stage for microscopicalexamination for chromosome aberrations (qv) - knownas metaphase analysis. METASTASIS The process whereby malignant cells become detached from the primary tumour mass, disseminate (mainly inthe blood stream or in lymph vessels) and 'seed out'indistant sites where they form secondary or metastatictumours. Such tumours tend to develop at specific sitesand their anatomical distribution is often characteristic;it is non-random.

MUTATION Apermanent change in the amount or structure of the genetic material in an organism which can result in achange in the characteristics of the organism. Thealternation may involve a single gene, a block of genes,or a whole chromosome. Mutations involving singlegenes may be a consequence of effects on single DNAbases (point mutations) or of large changes, includingdeletions, within the gene. Changes involving wholechromosomes may be numerical or structural. Amutation in the germ cells of sexually reproducingorganisms may be transmitted to the offspring, whereasa mutation that occurs in somatic cells may betransferred only to descendent daughter cells.

TOXICOKINETICS The description of the fate of chemicals in the body, including a mathematical account of their absorption,distribution, metabolism and excretion. TRANSFORMATION The process by which a normal cell acquires the capacity for neoplastic growth. Completetransformation occurs in several stages both in vitroand in vivo. One step which has been identified in vitrois 'immortalisation'by which a cell acquires the ability todivide indefinitely in culture. Such cells do not have thecapacity to form tumours in animals, but can be inducedto do so by extended passage in vitro, by treatment with chemicals, or by transfection with oncogene DNA. Thetransformed phenotype so generated is usually, but notalways, associated with the ability of the cells to growin soft agar and to form tumours when transplanted intoanimals. It should be noted that each of these stages oftransformation can involve multiple events which mayor may not be genetic. The order in which these eventstake place, if they occur at all, in vivois not known. TRANSGENIC Genetically modified to contain genetic material from another species (see also genetically modifiedorganism). 176Annual report 2000TRANSGENIC ANIMAL Animals which have extra (exogenous) fragments of MODELS DNAincorporated into their genomes. This may include reporter genes to assess in-vivoeffects such as mutagenicity in transgenic mice containing arecoverable bacterial gene (lacZ or lac I ). Other transgenic animals may have alterations of specificgenes believed to be involved in disease processes (egcancer). For example strains of mice have been bredwhich carry an inactivated copy of the p53 tumoursuppressor gene (qv) -, or an activated form of the ras oncogene which may enhance their susceptibility of themice to certain types of carcinogenic chemicals. TUMOUR (Synonym - neoplasm) Amass of abnormal, disorganised cells, arising from pre-existing tissue,which are characterised by excessive and uncoordinatedproliferation and by abnormal differentiation (qv).BENIGN tumours show a close morphologicalresemblance to their tissue of origin; grow in a slowexpansile fashion; and form circumscribed and(usually) encapsulated masses. They may growingand they may regress. Benign tumours do not infiltratethrough local tissues and they do not metastasise (qv).They are rarely fatal. MALIGNANTtumours(synonym - cancer) resemble their parent tissues lessclosely and are composed of increasingly abnormalcells in terms of their form and function. Welldifferentiated examples still retain recognizable featuresof their tissue of origin but these characteristics areprogressively lost in moderately and poorlydifferentiated malignancies: undifferentiated oranaplastic tumours are composed of cells whichresemble no known normal tissue. Most malignanttumours grow rapidly, spread progressively throughadjacent tissues and metastasise to distant sites.Tumours are conventionally classified according to theanatomical site of the primary tumour and itsmicroscopical appearance, rather than by cause. Somecommon examples of nomenclature are as follows:- Tumours arising 2000Tumours arising from connective fat, cartilage or they of bonemarrow cells called leukaemias. Benigntumours may evolve to the corresponding malignanttumours; examples involve the adenoma ->carcinoma sequence in the large bowel in humans,and the papilloma -> carcinoma sequence in mouseskin.
