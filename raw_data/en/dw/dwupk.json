CANImmunize has been focused on immunization technology since 2012, when our team developed the CANImmunize app, which has been used by hundreds of thousands of Canadians to track their families' vaccination records. In December 2020, we partnered with the province of Nova Scotia to lead their COVID-19 vaccine roll-out, beginning with implementation in long-term care facilities, and expanding to meet the ever-changing needs of the pandemic response. Through this collaborative partnership, we developed ClinicFlow, an end-to-end immunization clinic management platform. Building on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded the platform to other vaccines, starting with influenza and Mpox vaccines, and ultimately to supporting lifespan vaccines across the province. This webinar will describe the ways in which an agile, partnership-driven response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a successful vaccine roll-out and how this approach can be used to address the need for high-quality, robust vaccine tracking and management solutions in the post-COVID-19 era. It will also outline how real-time data and patient engagement can be used to empower patients, combat disinformation about vaccine safety, and support evidence-based healthcare decisions. Finally, we will present how CANImmunize will continue to apply these lessons to streamline immunization clinics and help patients make informed vaccine decisions as the vaccine landscape continues to evolve and more vaccines come to market.

Presenter: - Dr. Arnaud Gagneur, MD, PhD, University of YouTube](https://youtu.be/c749bWMwATU) Midwives and Vaccinations: Delivering Informed Choice Discussions Date: Thursday, February 11, 2021 Duration: 57 minutes Description: Registered and Indigenous Midwives in Canada are primary care providers for pregnancy, birth, (approximately 6-8 weeks postpartum) and newborns integrated in the Canadian health care system. While midwifery training and competencies are parallel to those for physicians, the Canadian midwifery model focuses on the continuity of the carer, informed choice, choice of birthplace, and evidenced-based practice while seeking to protect normal pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding, and newborns. Current midwifery education, scope of practice and practice norms regarding immunization vary widely across the country. The Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM) and the National Aboriginal Council of Midwives (NACM) recently assessed current midwifery practice, and the perspectives and informational needs of midwifery clients around immunization. This presentation will describe the challenges and opportunities about what discussing vaccination through a midwifery informed choice lens presents and the role of midwives in immunization decision-making and service delivery. In addition, it will share some of CAM/NACM's assessment findings and the informational materials produced in response. Presenters: - Jasmine Chatelain, Registered Midwife - Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM) - Fallon Cooper, Registered Midwife - Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM) [Slides Available](/sites/default/files/Website%20Images/CANVax%20Webinar%20Series/Slides_Midwives%20and%20Vaccinations_JChatelain.pdf) [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0go9jC4JRvg&feature=youtu.be) Immunization in special populations: Are you really \"up to date\"? Date: Tuesday, June 23, 2020 Duration: 58 minutes Description: Vaccine preventable infections continue to cause diseases across the world. Various special populations are at increased risk of complications from these vaccine-preventable diseases. There are vaccination strategies and programs that are in place for these groups. However, many people who are considered immunocompromised or more susceptible to disease remain undervaccinated. Health care providers caring for these patients may ask themselves: - Which vaccines are recommended specifically for my patient? - How should I vaccinate my patients? - When should I be vaccinating these patients? - Who should be vaccinating these patients? - How can I find resources or guidance to help me optimize immunization? After this session, attendees will be able to: - Describe general principles of immunization in immunocompromised or high-risk patients - Distinguish between low-level and high-level immunosuppression. - Understand how to optimize vaccination in special populations and/or immunocompromised patients Presenter: - Dr. Anne Pham-Huy - University of CHEO and Immunize Canada [Slides Available](/sites/default/files/Website%20Images/CANVax%20Webinar%20Series/Slides_Webinar%20Presentation_Dr.Pham-Huy.pdf) [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/qbAPXbQr3Rs) Introducing the CARD system: Playing your best hand to improve vaccine delivery at school Date: Tuesday, May 19, 2020 Duration: 57 minutes This presentation will review: - The rationale for trying to optimize the vaccination delivery process at school - A new vaccination delivery framework (the CARD system) that integrates evidence-based strategies to reduce student pain, fear and fainting during school vaccinations - Factors that can affect implementation success.

By understanding the factors that influence practices of women's healthcare providers, improvements to antenatal care can be recommended. These changes can have a long-term impact on maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality related to vaccine-preventable illnesses. Presenter: - Dr. Courtney R. Green, PhD, MSc - Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) [Slides Available](/sites/default/files/Website%20Content/Webinars/CANVax%20Webinar%20Series_Vaccinating%20Pregnant%20Women_Courtney%20Green.pdf) [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/7q9aTYt5-DA) Increasing immunization coverage by strengthening the decision-making process of parents through motivational interviewing intervention in maternity wards: The EMMIE program Date: Thursday, February 20, 2020 Duration: 57 minutes Description: To date, many parents are concerned about accepting vaccines for their children and trying to convince them by simply providing the facts may backfire and make them even more hesitant. In this context how can health care workers overcome the challenge of meeting parental decision-making needs regarding vaccination of their children? The PromoVac strategy consists of an immunization education session given to parents in maternity wards using motivational interviewing techniques. The MI-approach aims to give information to parents, according to their specific needs and their individual level of knowledge with respectful acceptance of their own beliefs. The Promovac strategy has proven its effectiveness in Canada through numerous studies including multicenter randomized controlled trials and it is also effective as a new practice of care in maternity wards across the Province of Quebec through a governmental program (EMMIE program) since 2018. This webinar will present the main results of the PromoVac studies and the evaluation of the implementation of this strategy as a new public health program in Quebec.

Vaccine-hesitant parents may choose to refuse vaccines for their children, to delay vaccination, or to follow the recommendations of health authorities despite significant fears and concerns. Some authors attributed vaccine hesitancy to the proliferation of negative information about vaccines on the Internet. Other studies indicated that vaccine-hesitant parents adhere to a specific parental approach, such as intensive mothering. In North America, many normative views co-exist, most of them put children's needs as the priority. In this context, it is important to understand how the Internet participates in shaping maternity knowledge and the role of the Internet regarding health decision for their child's vaccination. This presentation is based on the findings of an online ethnography conducted in 2015. Non-participant and participant observations on three online social media groups for mothers, 19 individual interviews with mothers, and media monitoring on the topic of vaccines were conducted. The results highlight different types of vaccine hesitancy and the informational context of mothers and the tensions between health authority norms (such as the vaccine norm) and healthism ideology norms (such as questioning expert knowledge). Presenter: - Dr, Maryline Vivion, PhD - Quebec National Institute of Public [Slides Available ](/sites/default/files/Website%20Content/Webinars/Intensive%20Mothering%20and%20Vaccine%20Hesitancy%20in%20the%20Web%202.0%20Era_Slides_2020.pdf) [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt-B6imYmd4) Vaccine-Injury Date: Thursday, November 14, 2019 Duration: 34 minutes Description: In Canada, only the province of Quebec has a vaccine-injury compensation program. This CANVax webinar will provide participants with an overview of the dialogue on vaccine-injury compensation (VIC), the rationale for these policies, and how they function. The speaker will further describe the context and current status of VIC policies/programs in Canada, based on specific recent events, reviews of the literature, and other related conversations via social media and advocacy groups. The session will conclude with a conversation on gaps in knowledge and important next steps for Canada's immunization strategies and planning.
