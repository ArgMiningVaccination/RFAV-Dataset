This means you do not need to enroll in Medicare Part D and pay extra for prescription drug coverage. If you decide to enroll in Medicare Part D later , you will not have to pay a penalty for late enrollment as long as you keep your FEHB coverage. However , if you choose to enroll in Medicare Part D, you can keep your FEHB coverage and your FEHB plan will coordinate benefits with Medicare. Remember: If you are an annuitant and you cancel your FEHB coverage, you may not re-enroll in the FEHB Program. Please be advised If you lose or drop your FEHB coverage and go 63 days or longer without prescription drug coverage that' s at least as good as Medicare' s prescription drug coverage, your monthly Medicare Part D premium will go up at least 1% per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go 19 months without Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, your premium will always be at least 19 percent higher than what many other people pay . Y ou will have to pay this higher premium as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the next Annual Coordinated Election Period (October 15 through December 7) to enroll in Medicare Part D. Medicar e' s Low Income Benefits For people with limited income and resources, extra help paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available.

Pr eventing Medical Mistakes An influential report from the Institute of Medicine estimates that up to 98,000 Americans die every year from medical mistakes in hospitals alone. That' s about 3,230 preventable deaths in the FEHB Program a year .

Although some of these complications may not be avoidable, too often patients suf fer from injuries or illnesses that could have been prevented if the hospital had taken proper precautions. W e have a benefit payment policy that encourages hospitals to reduce the likelihood of hospital-acquired conditions such as certain infections, severe bedsores and fractures; and reduce medical errors that should never happen. These conditions and errors are called \"Never Events.\" When a Never Event occurs, neither your FEHB plan nor you will incur costs to correct the medical error . Y ou will not be billed for inpatient services related to treatment of specific hospital-acquired conditions or for inpatient services needed to correct Never Events, if you use APWU Health Plan preferred providers. This policy helps to protect you from preventable medical errors and improve the quality of care you receive. 7 2015 APWU Health Plan Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory FEHB Facts Coverage information W e will not refuse to cover the treatment of a condition you had before you enrolled in this Plan solely because you had the condition before you enrolled.

This law mandates that you be enrolled for Self and Family coverage in the FEHB Program, if you are an employee subject to a court or administrative order requiring you to provide health benefits for your child(ren). If this law applies to you, you must enroll for Self and Family coverage in a health plan that provides full benefits in the area where your children live or provide documentation to your employing of fice that you have obtained other health benefits coverage for your children. If you do not do so, your employing of fice will enroll you involuntarily as follows: Childr en's Equity Act 9 2015 APWU Health Plan FEHB Facts If you have no FEHB coverage, your employing of fice will enroll you for Self and Family coverage in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan' s Basic Option; If you have a Self Only enrollment in a fee-for -service plan or in an HMO that serves the area where your children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self and Family in the same option of the same plan; or If you are enrolled in an HMO that does not serve the area where the children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self and Family in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan' s Basic Option. As long as the court/administrative order is in ef fect, and you have at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, you cannot cancel your enrollment, change to Self Only , or change to a plan that doesn' t serve the area in which your children live, unless you provide documentation that you have other coverage for the children. If the court/administrative order is still in ef fect when you retire, and you have at least one child still eligible for FEHB coverage, you must continue your FEHB coverage into retirement (if eligible) and cannot cancel your coverage, change to Self Only , or change to a plan that doesn' t serve the area in which your children live as long as the court/administrative order is in ef fect. Contact your employing of fice for further information. The benefits in this brochure are ef fective January 1. If you joined this Plan during Open Season, your coverage begins on the first day of your first pay period that starts on or after January 1. If you changed plans or plan options during Open Season and you r eceive car e between January 1 and the effective date of coverage under your new plan or option, your claims will be paid according to the 2015 benefits of your old plan or option except when you are enrolled under this Plan's Consumer Driven Option. Under this Plan's Consumer Driven Option, between January 1 and the ef fective date of your new plan (or change to High Option of this Plan) you will not receive a new Personal Care Account (PCA) for 2015 but any unused PCA benefits from 2014 will be available to you. However , if your old plan left the FEHB Program at the end of the year , you are covered under that plan' s 2014 benefits until the ef fective date of your coverage with your new plan. Annuitants' coverage and premiums begin on January 1. If you joined at any other time during the year , your employing of fice will tell you the ef fective date of coverage. If your enrollment continues after you are no longer eligible for coverage, (i.e. you have separated from Federal service) and premiums are not paid, you will be responsible for all benefits paid during the period in which premiums were not paid. Y ou may be billed for services received directly from your provider . Y ou may be prosecuted for fraud for knowingly using health insurance benefits for which you have not paid premiums. It is your responsibility to know when you or a family member are no longer eligible to use your health insurance coverage. Under the Consumer Driven Option, if you joined this Plan during Open Season, you receive the full Personal Care Account (PCA) as of your ef fective date of coverage. If you joined at any other time during the year , your PCA and your Deductible for your first year will be prorated for each full month of coverage remaining in that calendar year . When benefits and pr emiums start When you retire, you can usually stay in the FEHB Program. Generally , you must have been enrolled in the FEHB Program for the last five years of your Federal service. If you do not meet this requirement, you may be eligible for other forms of coverage, such as T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). When you r etir e When you lose benefits 10 2015 APWU Health Plan FEHB Facts Y ou will receive an additional 31 days of coverage, for no additional premium, when: Y our enrollment ends, unless you cancel your enrollment; or Y ou are a family member no longer eligible for coverage. Any person covered under the 31 day extension of coverage who is confined in a hospital or other institution for care or treatment on the 31st day of the temporary extension is entitled to continuation of the benefits of the Plan during the continuance of the confinement but not beyond the 60th day after the end of the 31 day temporary extension. Y ou may be eligible for spouse equity coverage or T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC), or a conversion policy (a non-FEHB individual policy). When FEHB coverage ends If you are divorced from a Federal employee, or annuitant, you may not continue to get benefits under your former spouse' s enrollment. This is the case even when the court has ordered your former spouse to provide health coverage for you. However , you may be eligible for your own FEHB coverage under either the spouse equity law or T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). If you are recently divorced or are anticipating a divorce, contact your ex-spouse' s employing or retirement of fice to get RI 70-5, the Guide to Federal Benefits for T emporary Continuation of Coverage and Former Spouse Enrollees, or other information about your coverage choices. Y ou can also download the guide from OPM' s website, www .opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/plan- information/guides.

Y our costs for cover ed services This is what you will pay out-of-pocket for covered care: Cost-sharing is the general term used to refer to your out-of-pocket costs (e.g., deductible, coinsurance, and copayments) for the covered care you receive. Cost-sharing High Option: A copayment is a fixed amount of money you pay to the provider , facility , pharmacy , etc., when you receive certain services. Example: Under the High Option, when you see your PPO physician you pay a copayment of $18 per visit. Consumer Driven Option: There are no copayments under the Consumer Driven Option. Note: If the billed amount or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full is less than your copayment, you pay the lower amount. Copayment A deductible is a fixed amount of covered expenses you must incur for certain covered services and supplies before we start paying benefits for them. Copayments and coinsurance amounts do not count toward any deductible. When a covered service or supply is subject to a deductible, only the Plan allowance for the service or supply counts toward the deductible. High Option If you use PPO providers, the calendar year deductible is $275 per person. Under a family enrollment, the deductible is satisfied for all family members when the combined covered expenses applied to the calendar year deductible for family members reach $550. If you use non-PPO providers, your calendar year deductible increases to a maximum of $500 per person ($1,000 per family). Whether or not you use PPO providers, your calendar year deductible will not exceed $500 per person ($1,000 per family). If the billed amount (or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full) is less than the remaining portion of your deductible, you pay the lower amount. Example: If the billed amount is $100, the provider has an agreement with us to accept $80, and you have not paid any amount toward meeting your calendar year deductible, you must pay $80. W e will apply $80 to your deductible. W e will begin paying benefits once the remaining portion of your calendar year deductible ($275) has been satisfied. Note: If you change plans during Open Season, and the ef fective date of your new plan is after January 1 of the next year , you do not have to start a new deductible under your old plan between January 1 and the ef fective date of your new plan. If you change plans at another time during the year , you must begin a new deductible under your new plan. If you change from Self and Family to Self Only , or from Self Only to Self and Family during the year , we will credit the amount of covered expenses already applied toward the deductible of your old enrollment to the deductible of your new enrollment. However , if you change from High Option to Consumer Driven Option or from Consumer Driven Option to High Option, during the year , expenses incurred as of the ef fective date of the option change are subject to the benefit provisions of your new option. Deductible 24 2015 APWU Health Plan Section 4 Consumer Driven Option: Y our Deductible is your bridge between your Personal Care Account (PCA) and your T raditional Health Coverage. After you have exhausted your PCA, you must pay your Deductible before your T raditional Health Coverage begins. Y our Deductible is generally $600 for a Self Only enrollment or $1,200 for a Self and Family enrollment. Y our Deductible in subsequent years may be reduced by rolling over any unused portion of your Personal Care Account remaining at the end of the calendar year(s). Also, there is no separate Deductible for mental health and substance abuse benefits under the Consumer Driven Option. High Option: Coinsurance is the percentage of our allowance that you must pay for your care. Coinsurance does not begin until you have met your calendar year deductible. Example: Y ou pay 30% of our allowance for of fice visits to a non-PPO physician. Consumer Driven Option: Coinsurance is the percentage of our allowance that you must pay for your care after you have used up your Personal Care Account (PCA) and paid your Deductible. Coinsurance If your provider routinely waives (does not require you to pay) your copayments, deductibles, or coinsurance, the provider is misstating the fee and may be violating the law . In this case, when we calculate our share, we will reduce the provider ' s fee by the amount waived. For example, if your physician ordinarily char ges $100 for a service but routinely waives your 30% coinsurance, the actual char ge is $70. W e will pay $49 (70% of the actual char ge of $70). If your pr ovider r outinely waives your cost In some instances, an APWU Health Plan provider may ask you to sign a \"waiver\" prior to receiving care. This waiver may state that you accept responsibility for the total char ge for any care that is not covered by your health plan. If you sign such a waiver , whether you are responsible for the total char ge depends on the contracts that the Plan has with its providers. If you are asked to sign this type of waiver , please be aware that, if benefits are denied for the services, you could be legally liable for the related expenses. If you would like more information about waivers, please contact us at 1-800-222-APWU (2798). W aivers High Option: Our \"Plan allowance\" is the amount we use to calculate our payment for covered services. Fee-for -service plans arrive at their allowances in dif ferent ways, so their allowances vary . For more information about how we determine our Plan allowance, see the definition of Plan allowance in Section 10. Often, the provider ' s bill is more than a fee-for -service plan' s allowance. Whether or not you have to pay the dif ference between our allowance and the bill will depend on the provider you use. PPO pr oviders agree to limit what they will bill you. Because of that, when you use a preferred provider , your share of covered char ges consists only of your deductible and coinsurance or copayment. Here is an example about coinsurance: Y ou see a PPO physician who char ges $150, but our allowance is $100. If you have met your deductible, you are only responsible for your coinsurance. That is, you pay just -- 10% of our $100 allowance ($10). Because of the agreement, your PPO physician will not bill you for the $50 dif ference between our allowance and his/her bill. Non-PPO pr oviders , on the other hand, have no agreement to limit what they will bill you. When you use a non-PPO provider , you will pay your deductible and coinsurance -- plus any dif ference between our allowance and char ges on the bill. Here is an example: Y ou see a non-PPO physician who char ges $150 and our allowance is again $100. Because you've met your deductible, you are responsible for your coinsurance, so you pay 30% of our $100 allowance ($30). Plus, because there is no agreement between the non-PPO physician and us, the physician can bill you for the $50 dif ference between our allowance and his/her bill. Differ ences between our allowance and the bill 25 2015 APWU Health Plan Section 4 The following table illustrates the examples of how much you have to pay out-of-pocket for services from a PPO physician vs. a non-PPO physician. The table uses our example of a service for which the physician char ges $150 and our allowance is $100. The table shows the amount you pay if you have met your calendar year deductible. EXAMPLE PPO physician Non-PPO physician Physician's char ge $150 $150 Our allowance W e set it at: $100 W e set it at: $100 W e of our No: 0 Y es: $50 T OT AL YOU P A Y $10 $80 Consumer Driven Option: In-network pr oviders agree to accept our Plan allowance so if you use an in-network provider , you never have to worry about paying the dif ference between the Plan allowance and the billed amount for covered services. If your covered expenses are being paid out of your Personal Care Account or if you are receiving in-network covered preventive services, the Plan will pay 100%. If you have exhausted your Personal Care Account, you will be responsible for paying your Deductible and also coinsurance under the T raditional Health Coverage. Out-of-network Pr oviders - If you use an out-of-network provider , you will have to pay the dif ference between the Plan allowance and the billed amount only if you use up your Personal Care Account for the year . Note that it usually makes sense to use in-network providers because it will make your Personal Care Account go much further since money left in your Personal Care Account can be rolled over to be used in the next year . There is a limit to the amount you must pay out-of-pocket for combined medical and prescription drug coinsurance for the year for certain char ges. When you have reached this limit, you pay no coinsurance for covered services for the remainder of the calendar year . High Option: PPO benefit: Y our out-of-pocket maximum is $5,000 for combined medical and prescription drugs for either a Self Only or a Self and Family enrollment if you are using PPO providers and in-network pharmacies. Only eligible expenses for PPO providers and in-network pharmacies count toward this limit. Non-PPO benefit: Y our out-of-pocket maximum is $10,000 for combined medical and prescription drugs for either a Self Only or a Self and Family enrollment if you are using non-PPO providers or out-of-network pharmacies. Eligible expenses for network providers or in-network pharmacies also count toward this limit. Y our eligible out-of- pocket expenses will not exceed this amount whether or not you use network providers. Out-of-pocket expenses for the purposes of this benefit are: The 10% you pay (or the 5% you pay for Cancer Centers of Excellence) for PPO; inpatient medical services and supplies, sur gical and anesthesia services, services provided by a hospital or other facility and ambulance services, emer gency services/ accidents, mental health and substance abuse; and the medical deductible The 30% you pay for non-PPO; medical services and supplies, sur gical and anesthesia services, services provided by a hospital or other facility and ambulance services, emer gency services/accidents, mental health and substance abuse, dental; and the medical deductible The copayment of $18 for outpatient visits to PPO physicians Y our Catastr ophic pr otection out-of-pocket maximum for deductibles, coinsurance and copayments 26 2015 APWU Health Plan Section 4 The copayment of $40 for outpatient facility char ges in an Ur gent Care Center The 25% you pay for in-network brand name prescription drugs, and the $8 and $15 you pay for in-network generic prescription drugs The following cannot be included in the accumulation of out-of-pocket expenses: Expenses in excess of our allowance or maximum benefit limitations Any amounts you pay because benefits have been reduced for non-compliance with this Plan's cost containment requirements (see Section 3) The $300 per admission for non-PPO inpatient hospital char ges Expenses in excess of visit maximums for physical, occupational and speech therapy (see pages 38, 39) Expenses incurred in excess of the $90 per day provided under home nursing care (see page 42); and Expenses in excess of Hospice care and preventive care maximums The dif ference in cost when brand name drugs are purchased and a generic is available Drugs reimbursed at the non-network pharmacy level 50% coinsurance for retail drugs after the first two fills if Mail order is not used 100% of the cost for tar geted drugs if the Plan's step therapy is not followed Any associated costs when you purchase medications in excess of the Plan's dispensing limitations Cost associated with non-covered drugs and supplies Consumer Driven Option: If you have exceeded your Personal Care Account and met your Deductible the following would apply: In-network benefit: Y our out-of-pocket maximum is $3,000 for combined medical and prescription drugs for a Self Only enrollment or $4,500 for a Self and Family enrollment if you are using in-network providers and pharmacies. Only eligible expenses for network providers and pharmacies count toward this limit. Out-of-network benefit: Y our out-of-pocket maximum is $9,000 for medical for either a Self Only or a Self and Family enrollment if you are using out-of-network providers.

If you have already met your old plan' s catastrophic protection benefit level in full, it will continue to apply until the ef fective date of your coverage in this Plan. If you have not met this expense level in full, your old plan will first apply your covered out-of-pocket expenses until the prior year ' s catastrophic level is reached and then apply the catastrophic protection benefit to covered out-of-pocket expenses incurred from that point until the ef fective date of your coverage in this Plan. Y our old plan will pay these covered expenses according to this year ' s benefits; benefit changes are ef fective January 1. Note: If you change options in this Plan during the year , we will credit the amount of covered expenses already accumulated toward the catastrophic out-of-pocket limit of your old option to the catastrophic protection limit of your new option. Carryover W e will make diligent ef forts to recover benefit payments we made in error but in good faith. W e may reduce subsequent benefit payments to of fset overpayments.

An accidental injury is a bodily injury sustained solely through violent, external, and accidental means, such as broken bones, animal bites, and poisonings. What is a medical emergency? A medical emer gency is the sudden and unexpected onset of a condition or an injury that you believe endangers your life or could result in serious injury or disability , and requires immediate medical or sur gical care. Some problems are emer gencies because, if not treated promptly , they might become more serious; examples include deep cuts and broken bones. Others are emer gencies because they are potentially life-threatening, such as heart attacks, strokes, poisonings, gunshot wounds, or sudden inability to breathe. There are many other acute conditions that we may determine are medical emer gencies - what they all have in common is the need for quick action. If you are unsure of the severity of a condition in terms of this benefit, the Plan recommends that you first call its 24-hour nurse advisory service 1-800-582-1314, option 7, or your physician. Note: If you use an emer gency room for other than a recognized medical emer gency , facility fees and supplies will not be covered. 54 2015 APWU Health Plan High Option Section 5(d) High Option Benefit Description Y ou Pay After the calendar year deductible...

These include: Who can write your pr escription. A licensed physician or dentist, and in states allowing it, licensed or certified Physician Assistant, Nurse Practitioner and Psychologist must prescribe your medication. Wher e can you obtain them. Y ou can fill the prescription at an Express Scripts network pharmacy , a non-network pharmacy , or by mail. W e pay our highest level of benefits for mail order and you should use the mail order program to obtain your maintenance medications. W e use a formulary . Our formulary is the National Preferred Formulary through Express Scripts. A formulary is a list of medications we have selected based on their clinical ef fectiveness and lower cost. By asking your doctor to prescribe formulary medications, you can help reduce your costs while maintaining high-quality care. There are safe, proven medication alternatives in each therapy class that are covered on the formulary . Some drugs will be excluded from the formulary and coverage, see http://www .apwuhp.com/high_option_pharmacy_program.php for a list of excluded medications. This list is not all inclusive and there may be changes to the list during the year . A formulary exception process is available to physicians if they feel the formulary alternatives are not appropriate. Physicians may request a clinical exception by calling 1-800-753-2851. Brand/Generic Drugs Why use generic drugs? A generic drug is a chemical equivalent of a corresponding name brand drug. The US Food and Drug Administration sets quality standards for generic drugs to ensure that these drugs meet the same standards of quality and strength as brand name drugs. Generic drugs are less expensive than brand drugs, therefore, you may reduce your out- of-pocket-expenses by choosing to use a generic drug. A generic equivalent will be dispensed if it is available, unless your physician specifically requires a brand name drug. If you receive a brand name drug when a Federally-approved generic drug is available, and your physician has not received a preauthorization, you have to pay the dif ference in cost between the name brand drug and the generic, in addition to your coinsurance. However , if your doctor obtains preauthorization because it is medically necessary that a brand name drug be dispensed, you will not be required to pay this cost dif ference. Y our doctor may seek preauthorization by calling 1-800-753-2851. 58 2015 APWU Health Plan High Option Section 5(f) High Option The Plan may have certain coverage limitations to ensure clinical appropriateness. For example, prescription drugs used for cosmetic purposes may not be covered, a medication might be limited to a certain amount (such as the number of pills or total dosage) within a specific time period, or require authorization to confirm clinical use based on FDA labeling. In these cases, you or your physician can begin the coverage review process by calling Express Scripts Customer Service at 1-800-841-2734. These ar e the dispensing limitations: The Express Scripts Retail Network - you may obtain up to a 30-day supply plus one 30-day refill for each prescription purchased from an Express Scripts network pharmacy . After one 30-day refill, you must obtain a new prescription and submit it to the mail order program. If you do not, we will pay the non-network pharmacy benefit level. T o receive maximum savings you must present your card at the time of each purchase, and your enrollment information must be current and correct. In most cases, you simply present the card together with the prescription to the pharmacist. Refills cannot be obtained until 75% of the drug has been used. Exceptions for special circumstances - the Plan will authorize up to a 90-day supply at a network pharmacy for covered persons called to active military service. Also, the Plan will authorize an extra 30-day supply , either at network retail or Home Delivery , for civilian Government employees who are relocated for assignment in the event of a national emer gency . Authorization may be obtained from Express Scripts at 1-800-841-2734 or from the Plan at 1-800-222-APWU (2798). Non-network pharmacy - if you do not use your identification card, if you elect to use a non-network pharmacy , or if an Express Scripts network pharmacy is not available, you will need to file a claim and we will pay at the non-network retail pharmacy benefit level. Mail order - through this program, you may receive up to a 90-day supply of maintenance medications for drugs which require a prescription, diabetic supplies and Insulin, syringes and needles for covered injectable medications, and oral contraceptives. Some medications may not be available in a 90-day supply from Express Scripts by Mail even though the prescription is for 90 days. Refills for maintenance medications are not considered new prescriptions except when the doctor changes the strength or 180 days has elapsed since the previous purchase. Refill orders submitted too early after the last one was filled are held until the right amount of time has passed. As part of the administration of the prescription drug program, we reserve the right to maximize your quality of care as it relates to the utilization of pharmacies. Y ou may fill your prescription at any pharmacy participating in the Express Scripts system. For the names of participating pharmacies, call 1-800-841-2734, or go to www .express-scripts.com . Certain controlled substances and several other prescribed medications may be subject to other dispensing limitations, such as quantities dispensed, and to the judgment of the pharmacist. Personalized Medicine (voluntary pr ogram) The Personalized Medicine Program combines a Pharmacogenomic test (genetic lab test) with a clinical program to optimize prescription drug therapies for patients taking W arfarin (anticoagulant) and Plavix (antiplatelet). This program focuses on giving physicians information, on an individual level, on patients who have already been diagnosed with a disease or condition. The benefits of this testing, done with a simple cheek swab are: - Greater patient safety and ef ficacy through more precise dosing for W arfarin and Plavix - Elimination of adverse events since the patient will be taking the appropriate dose of W arfarin or Plavix from the early onset of therapy 59 2015 APWU Health Plan High Option Section 5(f) High Option Pharmacogenomic testing gives physicians personalized information they can use to make more precise prescribing and dosing decisions to help their patients receive the critical care they need. The Personalized Medicine Program is available to you at no additional cost. If your medication history indicates that the testing could be beneficial for you, a pharmacist will contact your physician to discuss the program. If your doctor agrees that the test results would be helpful, you will be contacted by a pharmacist to let you know that the testing is available. If you agree to participate, you will receive a cheek swab test that you can administer on your own. The results of your test will be sent to your doctor and to an Express Scripts pharmacist who has received special training in personalized medicine. The pharmacist is available to help your doctor interpret the results of your test. Y our participation is voluntary , and your doctor is still solely responsible for deciding which drug and dose is right for you. Coverage Authorization The information below describes a feature of your prescription drug plan known as coverage authorization. Coverage authorization determines how your prescription drug plan will cover certain medications. Some medications are not covered unless you receive approval through a coverage review (prior authorization). Examples of drug categories that require a coverage review include but are not limited to, Growth Hormones, Botox, Interferons, Rheumatoid Arthritis agents, Retin A, drugs for or ganic impotence, and FDA approved drugs for weight management. This review uses Plan rules based on FDA-approved prescribing and safety information, clinical guidelines and uses that are considered reasonable, safe and ef fective. There are other medications that may be covered with limits (for example, only for a certain amount or for certain uses) unless you receive approval through a review . During this review , Express Scripts asks your doctor for more information than what is on the prescription before the medication may be covered under your plan. If coverage is approved, you simply pay your normal copayment for the medication. If coverage is not approved, you will be responsible for the full cost of the medication. In our ongoing ef fort to provide a robust yet cost-ef fective prescription drug benefit, APWU Health Plan participates in programs to encourage the prescribing and use of generics and lower -cost alternative brands when appropriate. In most cases, you save money when the preferred generic or formulary brand is dispensed. One method that has proved ef fective in saving members money is \"preferred drug step therapy .\" Step therapy ensures that a generic alternative or brand alternative within a therapeutic category is used as a first-line treatment, before the use of a similar but more expensive drug. Specific therapeutic categories are identified as appropriate for preferred drug step therapy . Currently the Plan of fers the step therapy programs on Hypnotic, Osteoporosis, Migraine, Glaucoma, Hypoglycemic, Non Steroidal Anti- Acne, T opical Corticosteroids and T opical Immunomodulator medications. In situations where the tar geted drug is prescribed, doctors are notified of lower -cost generics and preferred brands. If the doctor approves, the cost-ef fective medication is dispensed. If the doctor disapproves, a coverage review is initiated. If the coverage review is approved, the member is responsible for the normal coinsurance found on page 61. If the coverage review is denied, the member is responsible for the full cost of the drug. If the member does not first obtain the Plan' s approval, they will pay the full cost of the drug. If approval is obtained after filling the prescription, the member may be reimbursed for any amount they paid minus their coinsurance.

Personal Car e Account (PCA) CDHP Important things you should keep in mind about your Personal Car e Account: All eligible health care expenses (except in-network preventive care) are paid first from your Personal Care Account (PCA). T raditional Health Coverage (under CDHP Section 5) will only start once your Personal Care Account is exhausted. Note that in-network preventive care covered under CDHP Section 5 does NOT count against your PCA. The Personal Care Account provides full coverage for both in-network and out-of-network providers. However your Personal Care Account will generally go much further when you use network providers because network providers agree to discount their fees. Y ou have flexibility about how to spend your PCA, and the Plan provides you with the resources to manage your PCA. Y ou can track your PCA on your personal private website, by telephone at 1-800-718-1299 (toll-free), or with quarterly statements mailed directly to you at home. If you join this Plan during Open Season, you receive the full PCA ($1,200 per Self Only or $2,400 per Self and Family enrollment) as of your ef fective date of coverage. If you join at any other time during the year , your PCA for your first year will be prorated at a rate of $100 per month for Self Only or $200 per month for Self and Family for each full month of coverage remaining in that calendar year . Unused PCA benefits are forfeited when leaving this Plan. If PCA benefits are available in your account at the time a claim is processed, out-of-pocket expenses will be paid from your PCA regardless of the date the expense was incurred. If the member has funds available in the PCA account, claims will always be paid out of the PCA first. If the member would like to use their FSA to pay a bill prior to using the PCA, please instruct the provider not to submit the claim to UnitedHealthcare. The member should get a copy of the bill from the provider and submit to the FSA carrier for reimbursement. This means that in some cases, the member may have to pay the cost of the services up front. Please remember that all benefits are subject to the definitions, limitations and exclusions in this brochure and are payable only when we determine they are medically necessary . Be sure to read Section 4, Y our costs for covered services , for valuable information about how cost- sharing works. Also read Section 9 for information about how we pay if you have other coverage, or if you are age 65 or over .

Personal Car e Account (PCA) A Personal Care Account (PCA) is provided by the Plan for each enrollment. Each year the Plan adds to your account: $1,200 per year for a Self Only enrollment or $2,400 per year for a Self and Family enrollment The Personal Care Account covers eligible expenses at 100%. For example, if you are ill and go to a network doctor for a $60 visit, the doctor will submit your claim and the cost of the visit will be deducted automatically from your PCA; you pay nothing. Balance in PCA or Self Only $1,200 Less: Cost of visit -60 Remaining Balance in PCA $1,140 There are two types of eligible expenses covered by your PCA. Basic PCA Expenses are the same medical, sur gical, hospital, emer gency , mental health and substance abuse, and prescription drug services and supplies covered under the T raditional Health Coverage (see CDHP Section 5 for details) Extra PCA Expenses include: - Dental and/or vision services are reimbursable out of your PCA and must be paid up front by you. W e will reimburse up to a combined maximum of $400 per Self Only enrollment or $800 per Self and Family enrollment each calendar year , including: - V ision exam performed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist - Eyeglasses and contact lenses - Dental treatment (including examinations, cleanings, fillings, restorative treatment, endodontics, and periodontics) - In-network preventive care services not included under CDHP Section 5, In-network Preventive Care benefits - Out-of-network preventive care limited to services shown as covered under CDHP Section 5 - Amounts in excess of the Plan allowance for services received out- of-network and covered under Basic PCA Expenses Note: Both Basic and Extra PCA Expenses are covered at 100% as long as you have not used up your Personal Care Account.

In-network Preventive Care is covered at 100% under CDHP Section 5 and does not count against your Personal Care Account. Y our Personal Care Account must be used first for eligible health care expenses. If your Personal Care Account has been exhausted, you must pay your Deductible before your T raditional Health Coverage may begin. Y our Deductible applies to all benefits in this section. The Consumer Driven Option provides coverage for both in-network and out-of-network providers. The out-of-network benefits are the standard benefits under the T raditional Health Coverage. In- network benefits apply only when you use a provider from the lar ge, national network. When a network provider is not available, out-of-network benefits apply . If you join at any time during the year other than Open Season, your Deductible for your first year will be prorated at a rate of $50 per month for Self Only or $100 per month for Self and Family for each full month of coverage remaining in that calendar year . When you use an in-network hospital, keep in mind that the professionals who provide services to you in the hospital, may not all be preferred providers. If they are not, they will be paid by this Plan as out-of-network providers. However , if sur gical services are rendered at an in-network hospital or an in-network freestanding ambulatory facility by an in-network primary sur geon, we will pay the services of anesthesiologists and sur gical assistants who are not preferred providers at the in- network rate, based on Plan allowance. If the covered services are performed at an in-network hospital or an in-network freestanding ambulatory facility , we will pay the services of radiologists and pathologists who are not preferred providers at the in-network rate, based on the Plan allowance.

T raditional Health Coverage benefits begin after covered eligible expenses total $1,800 for Self Only or $3,600 for Self and Family (the combination of eligible expenses paid out of your PCA and your Deductible) each calendar year . Note: Y ou must use any available PCA benefits, including any amounts rolled over from previous years, before T raditional Health Coverage begins. In year one, therefore, the Deductible is $600 for Self Only and $1,200 for Self and Family enrollment.

In future years, the amount of your Deductible may be lower if you rollover PCA dollars at the end of the year . For example, if you rollover $300 at the end of the year: Self Only Self and Family PCA for year 2 Rollover from year 1 $1,200 + 300 $1,500 $2,400 + 300 $2,700 Deductible paid by you + 300 + 900 T raditional Health Coverage starts when eligible expenses total $1,800 $3,600 If you decide to use your PCA for Extra PCA Expenses for other than covered dental and/or vision services, you may increase your Deductible. For example, if you have out-of-network preventive care for $150 and later have an accident that leads to a hospital stay , you will have to pay your Deductible plus \"make up\" the $150 dollars you spent on Extra PCA Expenses.

Please refer to the precertification information shown in Section 3 to confirm which services require precertification. What is an accidental injury? An accidental injury is a bodily injury sustained solely through violent, external, and accidental means, such as broken bones, animal bites, and poisonings. What is a medical emergency? A medical emer gency is the sudden and unexpected onset of a condition or an injury that you believe endangers your life or could result in serious injury or disability , and requires immediate medical or sur gical care. Some problems are emer gencies because, if not treated promptly , they might become more serious; examples include deep cuts and broken bones. Others are emer gencies because they are potentially life-threatening, such as heart attacks, strokes, poisonings, gunshot wounds, or sudden inability to breathe. There are many other acute conditions that we may determine are medical emer gencies - what they all have in common is the need for quick action. 99 2015 APWU Health Plan CDHP Section 5(d) CDHP Note: If you use an emer gency room for other than a recognized medical emer gency , facility fees and supplies will not be covered.

All char ges Personalized Medicine (voluntary pr ogram) The Personalized Medicine Program combines a Pharmacogenomic test (genetic lab test) with a clinical program to optimize prescription drug therapies for patients taking W arfarin (anticoagulant) and Plavix (antiplatelet). This program focuses on giving physicians information, on an individual level, on patients who have already been diagnosed with a disease or condition. The benefits of this testing, done with a simple cheek swab are: Greater patient safety and ef ficacy through more precise dosing for W arfarin and Plavix Elimination of adverse events since the patient will be taking the appropriate dose of W arfarin or Plavix from the early onset of therapy Pharmacogenomic testing gives physicians personalized information they can use to make more precise prescribing and dosing decisions to help their patients receive the critical care they need. The Personalized Medicine Program is available to you at no additional cost. If your medication history indicates that the testing could be beneficial for you, a pharmacist will contact your physician to discuss the program. If your doctor agrees that the test results would be helpful, you will be contacted by a pharmacist to let you know that the testing is available. If you agree to participate, you will receive a cheek swab test that you can administer on your own. The results of your test will be sent to your doctor and to an Optum Rx pharmacist who has received special training in personalized medicine. The pharmacist is available to help your doctor interpret the results of your test. Y our participation is voluntary , and your doctor is still solely responsible for deciding which drug and dose is right for you. 105 2015 APWU Health Plan CDHP Section 5(f) CDHP Benefit Description Y ou Pay Personalized medicine (voluntary pr ogram) Pharmacogenomic testing to optimize prescription drug therapies for certain conditions W arfarin (anticoagulant) Plavix (antiplatelet) Nothing Coverage Authorization The information below describes a feature of your prescription drug plan known as coverage authorization. Coverage authorization determines how your prescription drug plan will cover certain medications. Some medications are not covered unless you receive approval through a coverage review (prior authorization). Examples of drug categories that require a coverage review include but are not limited to, Growth Hormones, Botox, Interferons, Rheumatoid Arthritis agents, Retin A, drugs for or ganic impotence and FDA approved drugs for weight management. This review uses plan rules based on FDA-approved prescribing and safety information, clinical guidelines and uses that are considered reasonable, safe and ef fective. There are other medications that may be covered with limits (for example, only for a certain amount or for certain uses) unless you receive approval through a review . During this review , Optum Rx asks your doctor for more information than what is on the prescription before the medication may be covered under your plan. If coverage is approved, you simply pay your normal copayment for the medication. If coverage is not approved, you will be responsible for the full cost of the medication. The Plan will participate in other approved managed care programs to ensure patient safety and appropriate therapy in accordance with the Plan rules based on FDA-guidelines referenced above.

Coordinating benefits with Medicar e and other coverage Y ou must tell us if you or a covered family member has coverage under any other health plan or has automobile insurance that pays health care expenses without regard to fault. This is called \"double coverage.\" When you have double coverage, one plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payor and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payor . W e, like other insurers, determine which coverage is primary according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) guidelines. For more information on NAIC rules regarding the coordinating of benefits, visit the NAIC website at http://www .NAIC.or g . When we are the primary payor , we will pay the benefits described in this brochure. When we are the secondary payor , we will determine our allowance. After the primary plan pays, we will pay what is left of our allowance, up to our regular benefit. W e will not pay more than our allowance. When we are the secondary payor , we will not waive specified visit limits. Please see Section 4, Y our costs for covered services, for more information about how we pay claims. When you have other health coverage TRICARE is the health care program for eligible dependents of military persons, and retirees of the military . TRICARE includes the CHAMPUS program. CHAMPV A provides health coverage to disabled V eterans and their eligible dependents. If TRICARE or CHAMPV A and this Plan cover you, we pay first. See your TRICARE or CHAMPV A Health Benefits Advisor if you have questions about these programs. Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in TRICARE or CHAMPV A: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these programs, eliminating your FEHB premium. (OPM does not contribute to any applicable plan premiums.) For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement of fice. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under TRICARE or CHAMPV A. TRICARE and CHAMPV A W e do not cover services that: Y ou (or a covered family member) need because of a workplace-related illness or injury that the Of fice of W orkers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) or a similar Federal or State agency determines they must provide; or OWCP or a similar agency pays for through a third-party injury settlement or other similar proceeding that is based on a claim you filed under OWCP or similar laws. Once OWCP or similar agency pays its maximum benefits for your treatment, we will cover your care. W orkers' Compensation When you have this Plan and Medicaid, we pay first. Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in Medicaid or a similar State-sponsor ed pr ogram of medical assistance: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these State programs, eliminating your FEHB premium.

When other Government agencies ar e r esponsible for your car e 121 2015 APWU Health Plan Section 9 If we pay benefits for an injury or illness that you receive monetary compensation for from someone else (referred to as a \"third party\"), you are required to reimburse the Plan for the total amount of benefits it paid out of the compensation you receive. This is sometimes called \"subrogation\" and the dollar amount of the benefits paid for by the Plan is oftentimes referred to as its \"lien.\" Reimbursement to the Plan is a requirement and condition on your obtaining benefits under the FEHB Program and from the Plan under this brochure. The Plan credits the net funds it recovers through reimbursement and subrogation to the Employee Health Benefits Fund which ultimately helps lower subscription char ges for all enrollees in the FEHB Program. This section explains your basic obligations and procedures about this reimbursement requirement. By enrolling in the Plan and in accordance with the FEHB Program and this brochure, you agree to the following: Y ou will reimburse the Plan in any and all situations where you recover money from any source related to an injury or illness for which the Plan has paid benefits. This may include money recovered from a lawsuit, a settlement, administrative claims (such as worker's compensation), a third party' s insurance, or your own automobile or homeowner ' s insurance. Y ou will reimburse the Plan up to the total amount of benefits for the care related to the injury or illness that the Plan has paid or reasonably anticipates paying. This reimbursement responsibility covers benefits for you and any other person on your membership. Similarly , you are obligated to reimburse the Plan from any money that is recovered, whether that money is recovered by you directly or by your legal representatives, dependents, heirs, estate, administrators, successors or assignees. Y ou will reimburse the Plan on a first priority basis out of any recovery you obtain no matter the source (litigation, settlement, insurance claim or settlement) and no matter how the recovery is characterized (such as your claim against the third party being for \"pain and suf fering\"). Y ou will not do anything that would prevent us from being fully reimbursed for the benefits we paid, and you will cooperate in assisting us in recovering the cost of the benefits we paid. Y ou agree and authorize the Plan to communicate directly with any of your insurance carriers regarding your injury or illness and their reimbursements. Y ou are obligated to reimburse the Plan even if the amount you receive does not compensate you fully or if you have other liens or expenses. W e are entitled to be reimbursed for our benefit payments even if you are not legally \"made whole\" for all of your damages arising out of the injury or illness. Our right of recovery is also not subject to reductions for attorney' s fees or costs in recovering the money under the \"common fund\" or other legal doctrines. If you wish to discuss the amount of reimbursement to pay to the Plan, please contact Customer Service (High Option, 1-800-222-2798; Consumer Driven Option, 1-800-718-1299) or our subrogation representatives at the contact information at the end of this section. What to communicate to the Plan Promptly inform us if you have an injury or illness for which benefits paid by the Plan might be reimbursed or subrogated as described here. This includes reporting third party cases to Customer Service or responding to any questionnaires or surveys inquiring about benefit claims paid by the Plan. W e or our subrogation representatives will communicate with you about whether you owe the Plan any reimbursement. Failure to provide information related to reimbursements may delay the processing of your benefits. When others ar e r esponsible for injuries 122 2015 APWU Health Plan Section 9 If you make a claim or demand on a third party for compensation for an injury or illness for which the Plan has paid benefits, notify us immediately . W e will communicate with you to keep the status of your claim or demand updated in our systems so that there is no delay in processing your claims. W e may seek a first priority lien on the proceeds of your claim in order to ensure that the Plan is reimbursed for the benefits we paid or will pay . W e may also require you to assign to us (1) your claim or demand or (2) your right to the proceeds of your claim or demand. In all cases, we may enforce our right of recovery and reimbursement by of fsetting any undisputed amount you owe the Plan as a result of recovering money from a third party against future benefit payments on your behalf by the Plan. If you do not pursue a claim or demand against a third party , we reserve the right to ask you to allow the Plan to sue the third party in your name. The Plan' s right to reimbursement applies even if the Plan paid benefits before we knew of the accident or illness. Restrictive endorsements or other statements on checks accepted by the Plan or its agents to reimburse the Plan in a subrogation matter will not bind the Plan. If you need more information or wish to report or discuss a subrogation or reimbursement matter , please contact Customer Service or our subrogation representatives: High Option: ODSA P UnitedHealthcare 1-800-718-1299 Some FEHB plans already cover some dental and vision services. When you are covered by more than one vision/dental plan: Coverage provided under your FEHB plan remains as your primary coverage. FEDVIP coverage pays secondary to that coverage. When you enroll in a dental and/or vision plan on BENEFEDS.com, you will be asked to provide information on your FEHB plan so that your plans can coordinate benefits. Providing your FEHB information may reduce your out-of-pocket cost. When you have Federal Employees Dental and V ision Insurance Plan (FEDVIP) An approved clinical trial includes a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life-threatening disease or condition and is either Federally-funded; conducted under an investigational new drug application reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); or is a drug trial that is exempt from the requirement of an investigational new drug application. If you are a participant in a clinical trial, this health plan will provide related care as follows, if it is not provided by the clinical trial: Routine care costs - costs for routine services such as doctor visits, lab tests, X-rays and scans, and hospitalizations related to treating the patient' s condition, whether the patient is in a clinical trial or is receiving standard therapy Extra care costs - costs related to taking part in a clinical trial such as additional tests that a patient may need as part of the trial, but not as part of the patient' s routine care Clinical trials 123 2015 APWU Health Plan Section 9 Research costs - costs related to conducting the clinical trial such as research physician and nurse time, analysis of results, and clinical tests performed only for research purposes. These costs are generally covered by the clinical trials. This Plan does not cover these costs When you have Medicar e Medicare is a health insurance program for: People 65 years of age or older Some people with disabilities under 65 years of age People with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant) Medicare has four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance). Most people do not have to pay for Part A. If you or your spouse worked for at least 10 years in Medicare-covered employment, you should be able to qualify for premium-free Part A insurance. (If you were a Federal employee at any time both before and during January 1983, you will receive credit for your Federal employment before January 1983.) Otherwise, if you are age 65 or older , you may be able to buy it. Contact 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), (TTY : 1-877-486-2048) for more information. Part B (Medical Insurance). Most people pay monthly for Part B. Generally , Part B premiums are withheld from your monthly Social Security check or your retirement check. Part C (Medicare Advantage). Y ou can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan to get your Medicare benefits. W e do not of fer a Medicare Advantage plan. Please review the information on coordinating benefits with Medicare Advantage plans on page 126. Part D (Medicare prescription drug coverage). There is a monthly premium for Part D coverage. Before enrolling in Medicare Part D, please review the important disclosure notice from us about the FEHB prescription drug coverage and Medicare. The notice is on the first inside page of this brochure. For people with limited income and resources, extra help in paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available. For more information about this extra help, visit the Social Security Administration online at www .socialsecurity .gov , or call them at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY : 1 -800-325-0778). What is Medicar e? The decision to enroll in Medicare is yours. W e encourage you to apply for Medicare benefits 3 months before you turn age 65. It' s easy . Just call the Social Security Administration toll-free number 1-800-772-1213, (TTY : 1-800-325-0778) to set up an appointment to apply . If you do not apply for one or more Parts of Medicare, you can still be covered under the FEHB Program. If you can get premium-free Part A coverage, we advise you to enroll in it. Most Federal employees and annuitants are entitled to Medicare Part A at age 65 without cost . When you don' t have to pay premiums for Medicare Part A, it makes good sense to obtain the coverage. It can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses as well as costs to the FEHB, which can help keep FEHB premiums down. Should I enr oll in Medicar e? 124 2015 APWU Health Plan Section 9 Everyone is char ged a premium for Medicare Part B coverage. The Social Security Administration can provide you with premium and benefit information. Review the information and decide if it makes sense for you to buy the Medicare Part B coverage. If you do not sign up for Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may be char ged a Medicare Part B late enrollment penalty of a 10 % increase in premium for every 12 months you are not enrolled. If you didn't take Part B at age 65 because you were covered under FEHB as an active employee (or you were covered under your spouse's group health insurance plan and he/she was an active employee), you may sign up for Part B (generally without an increased premium) within 8 months from the time you or your spouse stop working or are no longer covered by the group plan. Y ou also can sign up at any time while you are covered by the group plan. If you are eligible for Medicare, you may have choices in how you get your health care. Medicare Advantage is the term used to describe the various private health plan choices available to Medicare beneficiaries. The information in the next few pages shows how we coordinate benefits with Medicare, depending on whether you are in the Original Medicare Plan or a private Medicare Advantage plan. (Please r efer to page 128 for information about how we pr ovide benefits when you ar e age 65 or older and do not have Medicar e.) The Original Medicare Plan (Original Medicare) is available everywhere in the United States. It is the way everyone used to get Medicare benefits and is the way most people get their Medicare Part A and Part B benefits now . Y ou may go to any doctor , specialist, or hospital that accepts Medicare. The Original Medicare Plan pays its share and you pay your share. All physicians and other providers are required by law to file claims directly to Medicare for members with Medicare Part B, when Medicare is primary . This is true whether or not they accept Medicare. When you are enrolled in Original Medicare along with this Plan, you still need to follow the rules in this brochure for us to cover your care. Claims pr ocess when you have the Original Medicar e Plan - Y ou will probably not need to file a claim form when you have both our Plan and the Original Medicare Plan. When we are the primary payor , we process the claim first. In this case, we do not waive any out-of-pocket costs. When Original Medicare is the primary payor , Medicare processes your claim first.

Y ou can find more information about how our Plan coordinates benefits with Medicare in APWU Health Plan's Blueprint to Medicare at www .apwuhp.com . Y ou must tell us if you or a covered family member has Medicare coverage, and let us obtain information about services denied or paid under Medicare if we ask. Y ou must also tell us about other coverage you or your covered family members may have, as this coverage may af fect the primary/secondary status of this Plan and Medicare. T ell us about your Medicar e coverage A physician may ask you to sign a private contract agreeing that you can be billed directly for services ordinarily covered by Original Medicare. Should you sign an agreement, Medicare will not pay any portion of the char ges, and we will not increase our payment. W e will still limit our payment to the amount we would have paid after Original Medicare' s payment. Y ou may be responsible for paying the dif ference between the billed amount and the amount we paid. Private contract with your physician If you are eligible for Medicare, you may choose to enroll in and get your Medicare benefits from a Medicare Advantage plan. These are private health care choices (like HMOs and regional PPOs) in some areas of the country . T o learn more about Medicare Advantage plans, contact Medicare at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), (TTY : 1-877-486-2048) or at www .medicare.gov .

W e will still provide benefits when your Medicare Advantage plan is primary , even out of the Medicare Advantage plan' s network and/or service area (if you use our Plan providers). However we will not waive any of our copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles. If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, tell us. W e will need to know whether you are in the Original Medicare Plan or in a Medicare Advantage plan so we can correctly coordinate benefits with Medicare. Suspended FEHB coverage to enr oll in a Medicar e Advantage plan: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, eliminating your FEHB premium.

Medicar e pr escription drug coverage (Part D) 126 2015 APWU Health Plan Section 9 Medicare always makes the final determination as to whether they are the primary payor . The following chart illustrates whether Medicare or this Plan should be the primary payor for you according to your employment status and other factors determined by Medicare.

Y our physician and hospital must follow Medicare rules and cannot bill you for more than they could bill you if you had Medicare. Y ou and the FEHB benefit from these payment limits. Outpatient hospital care and non-physician based care are not covered by this law; regular Plan benefits apply . The following chart has more information about the limits. If you: are age 65 or over; and do not have Medicare Part A, Part B, or both; and have this Plan as an annuitant or as a former spouse, or as a family member of an annuitant or former spouse; and are not employed in a position that gives FEHB coverage. (Y our employing of fice can tell you if this applies.) Then, for your inpatient hospital car e: The law requires us to base our payment on an amount - the \"equivalent Medicare amount\" - set by Medicare's rules for what Medicare would pay , not on the actual char ge. Y ou are responsible for your applicable deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments under this Plan. Y ou are not responsible for any char ges greater than the equivalent Medicare amount; we will show that amount on the explanation of benefits (EOB) form that we send you. The law prohibits a hospital from collecting more than the \"equivalent Medicare amount\". And, for your physician car e, the law requires us to base our payment and your coinsurance or copayment on: an amount set by Medicare and called the \"Medicare approved amount,\" or the actual char ge if it is lower than the Medicare approved amount. If your physician: Then you ar e r esponsible for: Participates with Medicare or accepts Medicare assignment for the claim and is a member of our PPO network, your deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Participates with Medicare and is not in our PPO network, your deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and any balance up to the Medicare approved amount. Does not participate with Medicare, your deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and any balance up to 1 15% of the Medicare approved amount. It is generally to your financial advantage to use a physician who participates with Medicare. Such physicians are permitted to collect only up to the Medicare approved amount. Our explanation of benefits (EOB) form will tell you how much the physician or hospital can collect from you. If your physician or hospital tries to collect more than allowed by law , ask the physician or hospital to reduce the char ges. If you have paid more than allowed, ask for a refund. If you need further assistance, call us. 128 2015 APWU Health Plan Section 9 W e limit our payment to an amount that supplements the benefits that Medicare would pay under Medicare Part A (Hospital insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical insurance), regardless of whether Medicare pays. Note: W e pay our regular benefits for emer gency services to an institutional provider , such as a hospital, that does not participate with Medicare and is not reimbursed by Medicare. W e use the Department of V eterans Af fairs (V A) Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice (MRA) when the statement is submitted to determine our payment for covered services provided to you if Medicare is primary , when Medicare does not pay the V A facility . If you are covered by Medicare Part B and it is primary , your out-of-pocket costs for services that both Medicare Part B and we cover depend on whether your physician accepts Medicare assignment for the claim. High Option: If your physician accepts Medicare assignment, then you pay nothing for covered char ges up to our allowance. Consumer Driven Option: If your physician accepts Medicare assignment, then you pay nothing if you have unused benefits available under your Personal Care Account to pay the dif ference between the Medicare approved amount and Medicare's payment. If your PCA is exhausted, you must pay either this full dif ference under your Deductible or the lesser of your coinsurance or the full dif ference if your Deductible has been met. If your physician does not accept Medicare assignment, then you pay the dif ference between the \"limiting char ge\" or the physician' s char ge (whichever is less) and our payment combined with Medicare' s payment. It is important to know that a physician who does not accept Medicare assignment may not bill you for more than 1 15% of the amount Medicare bases its payment on, called the \"limiting char ge.\" The Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) that Medicare will send you will have more information about the limiting char ge. If your physician tries to collect more than allowed by law , ask the physician to reduce the char ges. If the physician does not, report the physician to the Medicare carrier that sent you the MSN form. Call us if you need further assistance.

Pharmacogenomics Our Plan allowance is the amount we use to determine our payment and your coinsurance for covered services. Fee-for -service plans determine their allowances in dif ferent ways. W e determine our allowance as follows: For PPO providers, our allowance is based on negotiated rates. PPO providers always accept the Plan' s allowance as their char ge for covered services. For non-PPO providers, we base the Plan allowance on the lesser of the provider ' s actual char ge or the allowed amount for the service you received. W e determine the allowed amount by using health care char ges guides which compare char ges of other providers for similar services in the same geographical area. For sur gery , doctor ' s services, X-ray , lab and therapies (physical, speech and occupational), we use guides prepared by the Context4Healthcare and OptumInsight and apply these guides under the High Option at the 70 th percentile and under the Consumer Driven Option at the 80 th percentile. W e update these char ges guides at least once each year . If this information is not available, we will use other credible sources including our own data. For more information, see Dif ferences between our allowance and the bill in Section 4. Plan allowance Any claims that are not pre-service. In other words, post-service claims are those claims where treatment has been performed and the claims have been sent to us in order to apply for benefits. Post-service claims Those claims (1) that require precertification, prior approval or a referral and (2) where failure to obtain precertification, prior approval, or a referral results in a reduction of benefits.
