Which of these \"Dosha\" imbalances sounds the most like you? Vata (air) \"I'm feeling so scattered\" My day begins but internally I can't help but feel the windy city within as it swirls around through each and every one of my cells. I try to ground myself, as I grasp for each thought like the clouds that float by. I tend to reach for tall salads and ice-cold drinks, on the run, if I don't forget to to stop for food entirely. As the night wears on, I toss and turn, usually awakening very early, feeling unrested and weightless. Pitta (fire) \"I'm a hot-headed mess\" I feel a hot desert sun that penetrates my every pore and builds in pressure from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head like a steam engine. If I could scream out loud, I might say 'everyone clear out, I got this under control' It scares me to know how angry and hot-headed I can really get. I find myself craving spicy foods, alcohol, and I sometimes suffer from \"heart burn\" and skin conditions. Kapha (earth) \"I've waited too long.\" I feel stuck, sticky, slow, muddy, and heavy. I know I should be exercising but I just don't have the motivation. I seem to put off everything until tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes. I can't seem to get out of bed before 9 am. My thoughts remain stuck and rarely manifest into action. I'm hopelessly addicted to sweets, cakes, cookies, ice cream and all of those creamy sauces. What can you do for Dosha imbalance?

This allows for detoxifying all 7 layers of tissues, or Dhatus as they are called in Ayurveda. (The 7 Dhatu layers of the body - Plasma, Blood, Muscle, Fat, Bone, Marrow & Nerves, Reproductive Tissue) It takes at least 7 days to reach and cleanse the deepest level of tissue. 8 - 21 Day Program For those with more serious health concerns and chronic illnesses, we may suggest that you follow a longer program.

In India, it is common for one to undergo pancha karma rejuvenation for up to 90 days, at which point the body/mind is totally transformed and made new again. * Fees can be adjusted/discounted to reflect the longer program.
