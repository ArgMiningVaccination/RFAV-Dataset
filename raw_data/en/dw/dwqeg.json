Feeling these emotions allows us to let go and move on.\" - Ingrid Bacci, Ph.D., [The Art of Effortless Living](https://amzn.to/3Xpzz7V) (2000) What is a Healing Ritual? A ritual is typically an act of honor or reverence that is observed or performed on a regular basis. Rituals often define the customs and traditions of cultures, religions, and belief systems. However, a ritual can be something as simple as a routine that one follows on a regular basis. The repetitive, care-free nature of rituals can be very healing as they provide an opportunity for effortlessness, and even enable you to surrender to a higher power or act. The term \"ritual\" sometimes has a negative connotation. This is unfortunate since most rituals send positive energy, thoughts, and actions into the universe creating the opportunity for healing. Healing Traditions Many rituals are practiced in order to attain spiritual enlightenment and improved health. The following are some examples of healing traditions that lift the spirit: - Prayer - a simple daily prayer of reverence or gratitude can work wonders. More than 1600 studies have demonstrated that religious practices can greatly enhance health. - Meditation - [meditations](https://happyhealthyher.com/meditation/)are best performed on a regular basis so they become routine. - Tea Ceremony - tea is a healing drink on its own, but making your cup of tea into a moment of peace and appreciation enhances its benefits. Consider these words from Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh: \"You must be completely awake in the present to enjoy the tea. Only in the awareness of the present, can your hands feel the pleasant warmth of the cup. Only in the present, can you savor the aroma, taste the sweetness, appreciate the delicacy. If you are ruminating about the past, or worrying about the future, you will completely miss the experience of enjoying the cup of tea. You will look down at the cup, and the tea will be gone.\" - Burning Incense - the basic act of burning incense brings in the healing elements of [aromatherapy](https://happyhealthyher.com/aromatherapy/), and is a tradition that has been practiced for centuries. Shamanic Ceremonies Ritual has been a particularly powerful component of [Shamanism](https://happyhealthyher.com/health-systems/shamanism/).
