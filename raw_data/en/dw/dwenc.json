That is the conclusion of a new report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The report is the fifth of eight in an IOM series on vaccine safety and was sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. The batches of polio vaccine in question were administered between 1955 and 1963. More than 98 million people were vaccinated for polio in the US during that time period. The IOM committee creating the report found that between 10% and 30% of the polio vaccine given to US adults and children in that time frame was contaminated with SV40; estimates are that between 10 million and 30 million Americans were potentially exposed to SV40 through vaccination.

Accessing the Report The IOM committee's report is available via the National Academies Web site, at [http://national-academies.org.](http://national-academies.org.) \"Epidemiological evidence is inadequate to determine a causal relationship\" between SV40 and cancer, even though it is known that SV40 is a cellular transforming virus in experimental systems, said the report's Chair, Marie C. McCormick, MD, ScD, Chair of the Department of Maternal and Child Health at Harvard School of Public Health. \"It's impossible to determine how many actual cases of infection there were,\" she said in a conference-call telephone media briefing. \"Also, infection does not necessarily lead to illness, and detection of a tumor by itself does not indicate a causal relationship.\" Not Saying No Association However, she said that because the epidemiological studies committee members reviewed are flawed, \"the committee was quite unwilling to say there was no association\" between the contaminated polio vaccine and cancer. Overall, the IOM committee concluded that the biological evidence is of \"moderate\" strength that SV40 exposure from the contaminated polio vaccine could lead to cancer in humans under natural conditions. The IOM committee did not recommend a review of US vaccine policies in terms of cancer risks by any non-governmental national body or federal advisory body, since the polio vaccine has been free of SV40 contamination since 1963, but it did make other specific recommendations (see box). The contamination of the polio vaccine in question occurred due to exposure to SV40 from the monkey kidney cell cultures used to produce the vaccine. Most\u2014but not all\u2014of the contamination was in the inactivated polio vaccine administered during the crucial time period. In 1960, scientists discovered that monkey kidneys could be tainted with SV40, a previously unknown virus that causes a harmless infection in certain Asian monkey species, notably the rhesus monkey. In 1961, the federal government mandated testing of new lots of polio vaccine to make sure they were free of SV40; potentially contaminated vaccine was not recalled, however, and might have been used until early 1963. According to the IOM report, researchers have wondered for years about the effects of the contaminated vaccine\u2014if any\u2014on those who received it. The committee reviewed data showing that in rodent experimental systems infection with SV40 has been linked primarily to four types of cancer: mesothelioma; osteosarcoma; the rare brain cancer ependymoma, occurring primarily in children; and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Researchers have also detected SV40 DNA in human forms of these cancers. The IOM committee grouped the studies it reviewed\u2014done around the world\u2014into three categories: cancer incidence, cancer mortality; and cancer following prenatal exposure to vaccine containing SV40. The IOM committee reviewed ecologic studies; controlled observational studies; and uncontrolled observational studies. Members found that \"all of the studies that the committee reviewed concerning cancer incidence or mortality and exposure to polio vaccine containing SV40 have substantial limitations.\" Most of the epidemiological studies are subject to misclassification bias, because they rely on year of birth as a proxy for exposure to the contaminated vaccine, the report noted. It would not be possible to determine clearly which people actually received the contaminated polio virus without individual vaccination records, the committee concluded. Another limitation in these studies is the rarity of the cancers that are potentially linked to SV40 exposure, Dr. McCormick said. In its review, the committee found strong evidence that under experimental conditions SV40 can produce oncogenic transformation of cells in rodents, non-human primates, cell culture studies, and humans. The evidence that such transformation can occur under conditions of natural exposure is less clear; evidence derives from the fact that SV40 \"acts in ways consistent with tumorigenesis\" and that \"DNA sequences consistent with SV40 have been detected in several types of human tumors.\" Public Health Recommendations The IOM committee reviewing SV40 contamination from polio vaccine and cancer risk made the following recommendations: - Key US governmental agencies should develop a vaccination contamination prevention and response plan. - Sensitive and specific standardized serologic tests for SV40 should be developed and used. - Once there is agreement in the scientific community on the best detection methods and protocols, pre-1955 samples of human tissues should be assayed for the presence or absence of SV40 in rigorous, multicenter studies. - Further studies should be done on the transmissibility of SV40 in humans; - Until some of the technical scientific issues are resolved, additional epidemiological studies of people potentially exposed to the contaminated polio vaccine should not be done.
