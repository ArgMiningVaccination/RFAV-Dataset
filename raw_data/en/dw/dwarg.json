As indicated in 5.2.5, vaccine cell dosage will be approximately 1x10 7 , 4x10 6 , 1x10 6 , or 1x10 5 on the final cell yield. | Biological: Autologous, Lethally Irradiated Breast Cancer Cells | Vaccination with autologous tumor cells engineered by adenoviral mediated gene transfer to secrete GM-CS - Minimum Number of Vaccine Doses Created Using Participant Tumor Sample [ Time Frame: 40 Months ]Tumor samples were obtained via malignant effusion or a surgically accessible tumor nodule of 2 cm in greatest diameter. Tumor cells were processed to single cell suspension and transduced with adenoviral vector encoding human Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Then, the cells washed extensively and irradiated with 10,000 cGy. Over the next 14 days, sterility cultures were tested for endotoxin and mycoplasma contamination. Individual vaccine cell dose and number varied depending on the final cell yield from vaccine production. For stage II-III patients, the minimal dose was 1 x 10^5 cells and the maximal dose was 4 x 10^6 cells. For metastatic patients, the minimal dose was 1 x 10^5 cells and the maximal dose was 1 x 10^7 cells. - Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events [ Time Frame: Up to 58 Months ]Number of participants with grade 3 or higher adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. - Median Follow-up Time by Survival Status [ Time Frame: Up to 14 Years ]Participants followed for survival status. Participants who were alive were noted as such as late as December 2020. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
