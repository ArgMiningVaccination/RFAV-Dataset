Examples include Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) (see \"Definitions\") , Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) (see \"Definitions\") , Indian Health Service, Tribal, or Urban Indian Health Clinic s (see \"Definitions\") , Public Health Departments, Hospital -affiliated outpatient primary care practices , solo or group privat e practices, or Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) (see \"Definitions\"). The following are not eligible NHSC service sites , even if they are located in a HPSA: county/local prisons, inpatient hospitals (except for Critical Access Hospitals) , and other inp atient facilities . Clinics that limit care to veterans and active duty military personnel (e.g. VA Medical Centers and clinics, military bases, and civilian health care providers in the Tricare network ) are not eligible because they do not serve a designa ted HPSA . If the applicant works at more than one site (e.g., several satellite clinics), each site must be an NHSC - approved service site. The applicant must include all service locations in his/her application by selecting from the drop- down menu and initiat ing an electronic Employment Verification (EV) for each site. Selecting a site where the applicant is not providing direct patient care will disqualify his/her application. To receive the highest award level for working in a high -need HPSA, all service sites at which a clinician will satisfy their NHSC service obligation, must have a HPSA score of 14 or above. The site point of contact ( POC ) is the NHSC on-site, or greater organizational partner who has agreed to perform the applicant's initial em ployment verification, as well as the participant's in -service verifications (ISV) throughout the obligated service period. Once initiated by the applicant, the POC must complete the online EV in order for the application to be completed and ultimately submitted LPCs who work at schools that are NHSC -approved service sites are eligible to participate in the NHSC LRP, so long as they meet all other requirements listed above and are able to meet the clinical practice requirements for the entire calendar year (see \" Site Information and Service Requirements\" on page 18 and \"Requirements for School -Based Clinics\" on page 25). Career or guidance counselors are not eligible to participate in the NHSC LRP. 16 by the applicant, prior to the application cycle deadline . The applicant should initiate regular communication and follow up with the POC to ensure that EV is completed accurately and in a timely manner. The POC will receive periodic reminders to complete the EV; however, i t is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that the EV is complete and accurate , within a timeframe that will allow him/her to submit the NHSC application by the application deadline. The applicant will receive notification that the POC has completed the EV and should work to complete and submit the application, as soon as possible. The applicant must contact the POC to resolve any concerns regarding the responses provided on the EV. Applicant s will have the ability to edit their application and initiate a new EV if necessary (e.g., the site mistakenly stated that the applicant was not employed at the site or that the start work date is later than July 20, 2015). However, t he site must complete the corrected EV before the ap plicant can re submit the application, which must be done before the application deadline . The resubmitted application with corrected EV must be received by the March 30, 201 5 deadline or the ap plicant will be ineligible for an award . Errors made by applic ants and/or site points of contact cannot be corrected after the application deadline . Funding Preferences To determine which applicants are funded, consideration is given to c ommunity need, as determined by HPSA designation scores. These scores are indicated on the NHSC Jobs Center (see \"Additional Materials\" on page 39) - the higher the score, the greater the need. The NHSC will use HPSA data as of January 1, 2015 and will do so throughout the FY 2015 application and award cycle to deter mine the priority for selection and award amounts . The NHSC reviews and awards Loan Repayment Program application s by descending HPSA score, and based on other funding preferences identified below , to the extent that funding is available . The relevant HPSA score is e valuated based on the score of the site where the applicant will serve 100% of their service. If an applicant will serve at multiple NHSC- approved practice sites, with differing HPSA scores, the lowest score will be used to determine the order in which the application will be reviewed . The following funding preferences will be applied to all eligible and qualified applicants : Characteristics Likely to Remain in a HPSA plus Disadvantaged Background (see Definitions) . The NHSC will give priority to an appl icant who ha s characteristics that indicate a higher likelihood of continuing to practice in a HPSA once the service commitment is completed and who comes from a disadvantaged background . With the respect to the latter, the applicant must submit certifica tion from a school that he/she: (i) was identified as having a \"disadvantaged background\" based on environmental and/or economic factors or (ii) received a federal Exceptional Financial Need Scholarship. Characteristics Likely to Remain in a HPSA . The NHSC will also give priority to an applicant who ha s characteristics that indicate a higher likel ihood of continuing to practice in a HPSA once the service commitment is completed. Generally, the program will assess the applicant's experience in working wit h underserved populations, which can be demonstrated through past work and volunteer experiences, as well as an applicant's background. 17 Award Process Only the Secretary of HHS or her designee can make an NHSC LRP award. Awards cannot be guaranteed or granted by another person or entity including service site personnel, NHSC staff, a Primary Care Office, or a Primary Care Association. An applicant's electronic signature alone on the NHSC LRP contract document does not constitute a contractual agreement . The NHSC LRP contract becomes effective on the date it is countersigned by the Secretary or her designee. The participant's award letter will note the beginning and projected end dates of the service obligation. In addition, this information is contai ned in the participant profile on the Customer Service Portal. Participants will not receive service credit for any employment at an NHSC -approved service site prior to the effective date of their NHSC LRP contract. An applicant may withdraw his/her application any time before a contract is countersigned by the Secretary or her designee (see \" Application Review and Award Process \" on page 36 ). After a contract has taken effect, the Secretary or her designee may terminate the contract under the circumstanc es set forth below (see \" Contract Terminations \" below ). Award funds are disbursed in the form of a lump sum payment and will be electronically issued to the bank account provided by the participant approximately 90 days after the contract start date. Whe re the award amount is less than the maximum amount set forth in this Guidance, the payment will be calculated to include interest accrued during the period between the contract start date and the disbursement of funds. Once a contract is in place, t he NHSC LRP participant is required to participate in a New LRP Awardee webinar that will review program requirements. Participant s will be notified by email of upcoming webinars and other training opportunities . Contract Terminations The Secretary ma y terminate an NHSC Loan Repayment Program contract if, no more than sixty (60) days after the execution of the contract (i.e. signature of both parties) the participant submits a written request to terminate the contract, and returns all loan repayment fu nds that have been disbursed under that contract . The participant's written request should be made through the Customer Service Portal. If the LRP funds have been disbursed to the participant, he/she will receive separate instructions via the Customer Service Portal or via direct support from the NHSC outlining the process for returning the award ed funds. If applicable, award ed funds should be returned in the form of a check, mailed and made payable to the \"DHHS Collections Officer\" at : NHSC L oan Repayme nt Program Contract Termination 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 8 C-26 Rockville, Maryland 20857 Under the Treasury Offset Program, the Treasury Department is authorized to offset NHSC LRP payments for application to delinquent Federal and State debts, including delinqu ent child support payments. 18 NOTE: Contract termination will not be effective unless the participant submits a written request to terminate the contract and returns all loan repayment funds withi n sixty (60) days after execution of the Contract. Any attempt to terminate the NHSC LRP contract after sixty (60) days of execution of the Contract will not be effective. Updating Contact Information Applicants and participants must provide the NHSC with notification of any changes to their contact information ( e.g., name change, email, mailing address, or telephone number) prior to the change occurring, if possible, or immediately after the change occurs. Applicants can manage their contact information through their online application account on the \"Account Settings\" page . Once an applicant becomes a participant, he /she will be provided with information for logging into the Customer Service Portal. The NHSC LRP frequently corresponds with applicant s by email. It is important that the applicant check his/her email during the application process for correspondence from the NHSC office and make certain to disable SPAM blockers (or check the SPAM folder). SITE INFORMATION & S ERVICE REQUIREMENTS Most NHSC LRP participants are employees or independent contractors of non-Federal facilities in or serving HPSAs that have been approved by the NHSC for performance of the service obligation . Employment contract negotiations are solely the responsibility of the clinician and are between the clinician and the service site. The NHSC strongly discourages service sites from considering the loan repayment funds as income to the clinician when negotiating the clinician's salary . The terms of the employment contrac t should be carefully reviewed and fully understood by the clinician before the contract is signed. Applicants may want to seek legal guidance from private counsel before entering into an employment contract. It is important to remember that the partic ipant's service contract with the NHSC LRP is separate and independent from the participant's employment contract with their service site . Please note that the NHSC LRP requires a participant to work a specified minimum number of hours (defined below). I f the participant's employment contract stipulates fewer hours (and his/her salary is based on those hours), the participant is still required to meet the NHSC LRP service obligation requirements, and the participant's site administrator must verify his/he r total work hours (paid and unpaid) and NHSC full or half -time work status (see \"Service Verification\" on page 26) every six months during his/her period of obligated service. Service Requirements Every participant is required to engage in the full-time or half -time (as applicable) clinical practice of the profession for which he / she applied and was awarded an NHSC LRP contract, at his /her NHSC - approved service site(s). (1) Full-Time Clinical Practice. Full -time clinical practice is defined, for the pur poses of the NHSC, as a minimum of 40 hours /week, for a minimum of 45 weeks each service year. The 40 hours per week may be compressed into no less than 4 days /week, with no more than 12 hours of work to be performed in any 24 -hour period. Of the 40 hour s/week, a minimum of 32 hours must be spent providing direct patient care . Participants do not receive service credit for 19 hours worked over the required 40 hours /week and excess hours cannot be applied to any other work week. Also, time spent \"on call\" w ill not be counted towards the service commitment, except to the extent the provider is providing direct patient care during that period. Additional rules apply based on discipline and practice location. For these rules, please see \"Full -Time Clinical Practice Requirements , by Discipline \" below. (2) Half-Time Clinical Practice. Half -time clinical practice is defined, for the purposes of the NHSC, as a minimum of 20 hours /per week (not to exceed 39 hours / week), for a minimum of 45 weeks each service year. The 20 hours /week may be compressed into no less than 2 days / week, with no more than 12 hours of work to be performed in any 24 -hour period. Of the 20 hours /week, a minimum of 16 hours must be spent providing direct patient care . Participants do not rece ive service credit for hours worked over the required 20 hours / week and excess hours cannot be applied to any other work week. Also, time spent \"on call\" will not be counted towards the service commitment, except to the extent the provider is providing direct patient care during that period. Additional rules apply based on discipline and practice location. For these rules, please see \" Half-Time Clinical Practice Requirements , by Discipline \" on page 22. Inpatient Settings Inpatient hospital settings (e xcept CAHs) are not eligible NHSC service sites. Thus, clinicians who are employ ed in an inpatient setting in a full time capacity are not eligible for an NHSC LRP award. Hospitalists do not qualify for the NHSC LRP unless they can consistently meet the required minimum number of hours per week in an approved outpatient setting, as set forth in the clinical practice requirements below . Military Service As noted on p. 5, Reservists and National Guard members are eligible to apply for NHSC LRP funding. Participants with a Reserve or National Guard obligation who are called to active duty while performing NHSC service will not receive NHSC service credit for the period of active duty, but may qualify for a suspension of their NHSC obligation. See Suspensio ns, Waiver and Cancellation on page 31. NHSC LRP participants who enlist in any of the Armed Forces and incur an active duty military obligation before completing their NHSC obligation are subject to the default provision of their NHSC LRP contract.

The following definitions apply to both full -time and half -time clinical practice : Administrative , Management or other non -clinical a ctivities include charting, research, attending staff meetings, court appearances, and other non -treatment related activities pertaining to the participant's approved NHSC practice. Any time spent in a management role is also considered to be an administrative activity. The duties of a medical director are also considered primarily administrative , and NHSC LRP applicants serving in such a capacity should keep in mind that they cannot count more than 8 hours per week of administrative and/or management tim e (4 hours in the case of half -time) toward the total required 40 hours per week (or 20 hours in the case of half -time) . Teaching activities, to qualify as clinical practice , require NHSC LRP participant s to provide clinical education to students and re sidents in their area of expertise at the approved service site(s). All teaching must be conducted at the NHSC -approved service site(s). The clinical education may: (1) Be conducted as part of an accredited clinical training program; (2) Include the clinical sup ervision of a student/resident that is required in order for that student/resident to receive a license under State law; or 25 (3) Include mentoring that is conducted as part of the Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP), or the Centers of Excellence program. Clinical service provided by NHSC participants while a student/resident observes, should be counted as direct patient care, not teaching, as the NHSC LRP participant is treating the patient. Requirements for School -Based Clinics For providers working at an NHSC- approved school -based clinic, the NHSC require s that the school - based clinic is open year -round with sufficient patient visits to meet the clinical practice requirements. If the NHSC -approved site is not open year -round, the clinician will be req uired to work at additional NHSC- approved sites to meet the clinical practice requirements. F ailure to provide required verification documentation that the participant is meeting NHSC service requirements at the school -based clinic year -round or failure t o obtain additional employment necessary to maintain compliance with NHSC clinical practice requirements will disqualify providers from participating or result in a breach of the NHSC Loan Repayment Program contract. Telemedicine and Home Health Policies (1) Telemedicine. Subject to the restrictions below, the NHSC will consider telemedicine as direct patient care when both the originating site (location of the patient) and the distant site (the NHSC- approved site where the NHSC clinician works) are located i n a health professional shortage area (HPSA). Also, both the originating site and the distant site must meet the HPSA score requirements associated with the contract under which the applicant is applying to serve . For example, if the applicant would be s erving at a site scoring 14 or above, his/her telemedicine patients must also be located at a site that scores 14 or above . Further , the individual must follow all applicable licensing requirements and must meet the NHSC requirement to be licensed in the State of practice . Thus, if the originating site and distant site are in different States, the NHSC participant must be licensed in both. a. An NHSC clinician is prohibited from counting telemedicine encounters as more than 25 percent (i.e., no more than 8 hours per week for full -time participants and no more than 4 hours per week for half -time participants) of their direct patient care hours. b. Telemedicine services must be furnished using an interactive telecommunications system, defined as multimedia communications equipment that includes, at a minimum, audio and video equipment permitting two -way, real time interactive communication between the patient at the originating site and the NHSC clinician at the distant site. c. Telephones, facsimile machines, and electronic mail systems do not meet the definition of an interactive telecommunications system. Home Health. The NHSC does not currently recognize the homes of patients as NHSC -approved sites. As such, home visits may only be conducted at the direction of the NHSC -approved site a nd may only be counted in the alternative setting allotment for direct patient care (see \"Full -Time Clinical Practice Requirements by Discipline \" on page 19 and \" Half-Time Clinical Practice Requirements by Discipline \" on page 22) . Absences Policy Please note that the information provided below pertains to compliance with the NHSC LRP service obligation and is not a guarantee that a service site will allow any particular amount of leave. 26 (1) Full- time participants are allowed to spen d no more than 35 full- time workdays per service year away from the NHSC -approved service site for vacation, holidays, continuing professional education, illness, or any other reason. (2) Half-time participants are allowed to spend no more than 35 half -time workdays per service year away from their site for vacation, holidays, continuing professional education, illness, or any other reason. (3) If a participant works more than the minimum number of hours per week (40 for full- time, 20 for half -time), the only time spent away from the site that will need to be reported (see \"Service Verification \" below) and deducted from the allowed absences per service year (set forth above) are the hours of absence that cause a participant's work hours to fall below the requir ed minimum number of hours per week. For example, a half -time participant whose work schedule is 32 hours per week would not need to report 12 hours of sick leave taken, because the participant has still met the requirement of a minimum of 20 hours per we ek. Participant s who have a medical or personal emergency that will result in an extended period of absence will need to request a suspension of the NHSC service commitment and provide supporting documentation. The NHSC cannot guarantee that a suspension request will be approved. If a suspension is requested and approved, the participant's service commitment end date will be extended accordingly. See \"Suspension, Waiver, and C ancellation\" on page 31. Maternity/Paternity/Adoption Leave Policy Maternity/ paternity/adoption leave of 12 weeks or less will be automatically approved by the NHSC , if documented in the NHSC Customer Service Portal. If participants plan to be away from their site for maternity/paternity/adoption leave, the y are required to inform the NHSC before taking the leave. The NHSC will allow participants to be away from their site within the timeframes established by either the Family Medical Leave Act (up to 12 weeks) or the participant's state of residence; however, the participant must also adhere to the leave policies of his /her NHSC -approved service site. If participants plan to take additional leave, they are required to request a medical suspens ion (see \"Suspension\" on page 31), which may or may not be approved by the NHSC. Reques ts should be submitted through the Customer Service Portal. Remember that a participant is required to serve a minimum of 45 weeks per service year and is allowed to be away from the NHSC -approved service site for no more than 35 workdays per service year; therefore, a participant's obligation end date will be extended for each day of absence over the allowable 35 workdays. Service Verification Every 6 months, the NHSC verifies that participants are fulfilling their service obligation by meeting program requirements. The In -Service Verification (ISV) must be completed by the participant and the NHSC -approved site point of contact (POC) through the NHSC Customer Service Portal. By completing and electronically signing the ISV, the participant and the si te POC are certifying the participant's compliance or noncompliance with the clinical practice requirements during the preceding 6 -month period. The verification will also record the time spent away from the service site, hours that fall below 40 (full -time) and 20 (half -time) hours/week . The site must complete the 6 -month ISV in order for the participant to remain in compliance, and it is the participant's responsibility to ensure that the ISV is complete and accurate. Participants who fail 27 to ensure that their 6 -month ISVs are complete d and submitted on time risk not receiving service credit. Participants who do not submit 6 -month ISVs or who are consistently late in submitting them will not be selected for a Continuation Contract. Changing to a Half-Time Service Commitment Conversions between full - and half -time service , during the service obligation period , are allowable under certain circumstances. Requests for conversion from full-time to half- time are considered for approval if ALL of the following conditions are met: (1) The participant's NHSC- approved service site agrees in writing, via the online EVF to notify the NHSC via the online EVF that he/she may convert to half -time clinical practice (as defined by the NHSC LRP above); (2) The particip ant is a Federal employee or a Private Practice Assignee (see \" Practice Types in the NHSC\" on page 27). The half -time service option is not authorized for PPO practitioners; and (3) The participant agree s in writing (by signing an addendum to his/her NHSC LRP full-time contract) to complete his/her remaining service obligation through half -time clinical practice for twice his/her remaining full time commitment . Requests should be submitted through the Customer Service Portal. I f the participant is approved t o convert to half- time status, his/her service obligation end date and his/her allowable leave will be adjusted accordingly. Participants who receive approval to serve half -time must fulfill the rest of their service commitment serving half -time; particip ants will not be allowed to switch back to full - time service once they have been authorized for half -time service . Half-time participants are only allowed to convert to full- time service at the point they enter into a new full -time Continuation Contract under the following conditions: (1) The participant ha s completed his/her initial 2 -year half -time service contract and any previous Continuation Contract. Participants will not be allowed to switch from half -time to full-time status within a service cont ract period (e.g., 6 months into a 2 -year half -time contract); (2) The participant's NHSC- approved service site agrees to notify the NHSC via the online EVF that he/she will convert to full- time clinical practice (as defined by the NHSC LRP above); and (3) The participant agree s to perform one year of full -time clinical practice at his/her NHSC- approved service site. Practice Types Generally, NHSC LRP participants will serve in the NHSC as either federal employees (Public Health Service Commissioned Officers or Civil Servants) or as Private Practice Assignees who are employees of a public or private entity, receiving an income at least equal to what he /she would have received as a civilian employee of the U.S. Government, including malpractice insurance with tail coverage (either commercial or through the Federal Tort Claims Act). In some circumstances, an NHSC participant is not subject to the personnel system of the site to which he /she is assigned, does not receive a salary equivalent to a civilian emplo yee of the U.S. Government, and/or is not provided malpractice insurance (including tail coverage ) by their site. In these cases, the clinician can request to fulfill his /her obligation through the Private Practice Option (PPO). Under the PPO, an NHSC LR P participant may be (a) an independent contractor or (b) a 28 salaried employee of an eligible NHSC -approved service site who is not receiving salary and malpractice insurance (including tail coverage ) at least equal to what he/she would receive as a Federal Civil Servant. In order to serve under the PPO, the applicant must make such a request by submitting a PPO Request Form . Completed PPO Request Forms should be uploaded as an additional document when completing the application. If it is identified during the application review performed by the NHSC that a PPO Request Form is necessary, the NHSC will send an email request to the email address associated with the application and provide a timeline for submission. In addition, if the NHSC approves such request, the participant must enter into a PPO Agreement that stipulates the special provisions that apply to those serving under the PPO. The PPO service option is open only to full -time participants. NOTE: Federal Assignments and Private Practice Assignments require the NHSC -approved service site to accept Medicare assignment, enter into the appropriate agreements under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and utilize a schedule of discounts (including, as appropriate, waivers) of fees based on a patient's ability to pay. See definition of NHSC -approved service site on page 42. The Private Practice Option requires the individual to comply with the same billing requirements. If you are... and your salary and malpractice/tail coverage are... you will serve under a: A Federal Civil Service employee or an active member of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps provided by a federal government entity Federal Assignment (FA) NOT a Federal employee but you are an employee of an eligibl e HPSA site at least equal to what you would earn as a civilian employee of the U.S. Government Private Practice Assignment (PPA) NOT a Federal employee but you are an employee of an eligible HPSA site less than what you would earn as a civilian employee of the U.S. Government Private Practice Option (PPO) NOT a Federal employee but a contr actor to an eligible HPSA site whatever income you earn or generate; whatever malpractice coverage you purchase or receive PPO CHANGING JOBS The NHSC expects tha t participant s will fulfill their obligation at the NHSC- approved service site(s) identified in the \"Confirmation of I nterest \" notification that applicants are required to electronically sign when they accept the offer of an NHSC Loan Repayment Program contract . If a participant feels he/she can no longer continue working at the approved service site, the participant should discuss the situation and/or concerns with his/her NHSC- approved service site management and contact the NHSC immediately through the NHSC Customer Service Portal. If the participant leaves his/her NHSC - approved service site(s) without prior approval of the NHSC, he/she may be placed in default as of the date he/she left the initial NHSC -approved service site and become liable for the monetary damages specified in the participant's NHSC LRP contract. 29 Site Change Participants who require a site change to another NHSC- approved service site, the participant must request a transfer through the NHSC Customer Service Portal. The site change must be approved and processed by the NHSC prior to the participant beginning to work at the new site. If a participant begins employment at a site prior to obtaining NHSC approval, he/she will not receive service credit for the time period between his/he r last day providing patient care at the initial service site and resumption of service at the transfer site following NHSC approval. If the proposed site is disapproved by the NHSC and the participant refuses assignment to another NHSC -approved service site, he/she may be placed in default. Unemployment Participant s who resign or are terminated from their NHSC -approved site(s) must contact the NHSC immediately through the NHSC Customer Service Portal. The NHSC provides regional assistance to help unemployed participants identify a position at an approved NHSC service site, so long as the unemployment is not the result of a termination for cause . Note: Participants who voluntarily resign from their sites without prior approval from the NHSC or are terminated by their site(s) \" for cause \" may not receive a transfer to another site, may be disqualified from Continuation Contract eligibility , and may be placed in default. Examples of termination for cause may include , but are not limited to : Violat ion of your organization's code of conduct or ethics policy Failure follow approved clinical practices Loss or suspension of clinical license Falsification of records (personal or patient) Breach of employment contract Threats or threatening behavior Stealing of money or property Dishonesty Extreme insubordination, Breach of information network policy Working at Sites That Are NOT NHSC -approved Participants who are asked to work at a clinic that is not listed in the provider's profile on the NHSC Customer Service Portal must immediately notify the NHSC through the Customer Service Portal. Generally, time spent at unapproved clinics will not count towards the service commitment. BREACHING THE NHSC LRP CONTRACT While t he NHSC will work with participants to assist them, to the extent possible, participants are reminded that the failure to complete service for any reason is a breach of the NHSC LRP obligation. Clinicians serving in a high -need HPSA (defined as a HPSA score of 14 or above) must transfer to another high- need NHSC -approved service site. 30 Prior to breaching his/her contract, the participant should make sure that he/she understands the following monetary damages required by Federal law. A participant who breaches a commitment to serve in a full -time clinical practice will become liable to the United States for an amount equal to the sum of the following: (1) The amount of the loan repaym ents paid to the participant representing any period of obligated service not completed; (2) $7,500 multiplied by the number of months of obligated service not completed; AND (3) Interest on the above amounts at the maximum legal prevailing rate, as determined by the Treasurer of the United States, from the date of breach. See Section 338E(c)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254o(c)(1)), as amended. A participant who breaches a commitment to serve in a half -time clinical practice will become liable to the United States for an amount equal to the sum of the following: (1) The amount of the loan repayments paid to the participant representing any period of obligated service not completed; (2) $3,750 multiplied by the number of months of obligated serv ice not completed; AND (3) Interest on the above amounts at the maximum legal prevailing rate, as determined by the Treasurer of the United States, from the date of breach. See Sections 331(i)(F) and 338E(c)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254d(i)(F) and 254o(c)(1)). Any amounts the United States is entitled to recover, as set forth above, must be paid within one year from the date of default. Failure to pay the debt by the due date has the following consequences: (1) The debt will be repor ted as delinquent to credit reporting agencies . During the one -year repayment period, the debt will be reported to credit reporting agencies as \"current.\" If the debt becomes past due (i.e., remains unpaid at the end of the one -year repayment period), it will be reported as \"delinquent.\" (2) The debt may be referred to a debt collection agency and the Department of Justice . Any NHSC LRP debt past due for 45 days may be referred to a debt collection agency. If the debt collection agency is unsuccessful in co llecting payment, the debt will be referred to the Department of Justice for filing of a lawsuit against the defaulter. (3) Administrative Offset . Federal or State payments due to the participant (e.g., an IRS or state income tax refund) may be offset by the Department of Treasury to pay a delinquent NHSC LRP debt. Also, defaulters who are Federal employees may have up to 15% of their take - home pay garnished to pay a delinquent NHSC LRP debt. (4) Licensure Sanctions . In some States, health professions licensing boards are allowed to impose sanctions, including suspension or revocation of a defaulter's professional license, if the defaulter fails to satisfactorily address repayment of his/her NHSC LRP debt. Note : The minimum amount the United States is entitled to recover from a partici pant who breaches a commitment to serve full- time or half -time will not be less than $31,000 . 31 Bankruptcy The participant should also be aware that i t is not easy to discharge an NHSC LRP debt by filing for bankruptcy. A financial obligation under the NHSC LRP is not dischargeable in bankruptcy for 7 years after the debt becomes due (i.e., for 7 years from the end of the one -year repayment period). A fter the 7 -year period of absolute non -dischargeability expires, the debt may be discharged in bankruptcy only if a bankruptcy court determines that it would be unconscionable not to discharge the debt. Sample Default Scenarios Scenario 1: Dr. Jane Smith entered into a 2 -year NHSC LRP full -time service cont ract effective January 14, 201 4. Her service end date is January 13 , 201 6. She received $ 50,000 in LRP financial support to apply toward her qualifying educational loans. She was terminated for cause by her service site at the end of her workday on March 31, 201 5. The NHSC determines that she defaulted on her LRP contract on April 1, 201 5, and served 44 2 days of her 2 -year (73 0-day) service obligation. Dr. Smith is liable to the United States for: (1) $ 19,725 for the loan repayments received for obligated service not completed (288/73 0 x $50,000) and (2) $75,000 for the months of service not completed ($7,500 x 10). Her total LRP debt of $94, 725 will begin accruing interest at the maximum legal prevailing rate as of her default date ( April 1, 2015 ), and is due to be paid in full on March 31, 201 6. Scenario 2: Dr. Smith entered into a 2 -year NHSC LRP half -time service contract effective January 15, 2014 . Her service end date is January 14, 201 6. She received $ 25,000 in LRP financial support to apply toward her qualifying educational loans. She resigned from her service site at the end of her workday on September 30, 2015 because she found a higher paying job at a clinic that is not located in a HPSA . The NHSC determines that she default ed on her LRP contract on October 1, 201 5, and served 625 days of her 2 -year (731 -day) service obligation. Dr. Smith is liable to the United States in the amount of $31,000, since the loan repayments she receiv ed for obligated service not completed (106/731 x $ 25,000 = $3,625.17) and the amount owed for the months of service she did not complete ($3,750 x 4 = $15,000) total less than $3 1,000. Her total LRP debt of $ 31,000 will begin accruing interest at the max imum legal prevailing rate as of her default date ( October 1, 2015 ), and i s due to be paid in full on September 30, 201 6. SUSPENSION, WAIVER, AND CANCELLATION The NHSC requires participants to fulfill their contract without excessive absences or signi ficant interruptions in service . Participants are allowed approximately 7 weeks of leave per service year; however, there are some circumstances that occur which will prevent a participant from staying within this timeframe. In these cases, the Secretary of HHS may, under certain circumstances, suspend ( i.e., put \"on hold\") or waive ( i.e., excuse) the NHSC LRP service or payment obligation. (1) Suspension. A suspension of the NHSC LRP commitment may be granted if compliance with the commitment by the participant: (i) is temporarily impossible , or (ii) would involve a temporary extreme hardship such that enforcement of the commitment would be unconscionable. Periods of approved suspension of service will extend the participant's 32 service commitment end date . The major categories of suspension are set forth below. Suspension requests are submitted through the NHSC Customer Service Portal. a. Leave of Absence for Medical or Personal Reasons . A suspension may be granted for up to one year, if the participant pr ovides independent medical documentation of a physical or mental health disability, or personal circumstances, including a terminal illness of an immediate family member (e.g. - child or spouse, including same -sex spouse regardless of where the couple live s), which results in the participant's temporary inability to perform the NHSC LRP service obligation. b. Maternity/Paternity/Adoption Leave . If the participant's maternity/paternity/adoption leave will exceed 12 weeks during that year of obligated service , a su spension may be granted by the NHSC based on documented medical need. c. Call to Active Duty in the Armed Forces. Participants who are military reservists and are called to active duty must submit a request for an NHSC service suspension through the NHSC Customer Service Portal. The period of active military duty will not be credited towards the NHSC service obligation. Suspensions for active duty military assignment are granted for up to one year, beginning on the activation date described in the reservist's call to active duty order. A copy of the order to active duty must be provided to the NHSC with the request for a suspension. In the event that the NHSC participant's period of activity duty with the Armed Forces entity is extended beyond the approved suspension period, the participant must contact the NHSC through the Customer Service Portal for guidance on how to request an extension of the suspension period. (2) Waiver . A waiver permanently relieves the participant of all or part of the NHSC LRP commitment. A waiver may be granted only if the participant demonstrates that compliance with his/her commitment is permanently impossible or would involve an extreme hardship such that enforcement of the commitment would be unconscionable. A waiver request must be submitted by uploading a signed request letter, including the reason(s) the waiver is being sought, as an inquiry through the NHSC Customer Service Portal. The participant will be contacted by the BHW Division of Participant Support and C ompliance/ Legal and Compliance Branch regarding the medical and financial documentation necessary to complete the waiver request . All documents can be submitted through the Customer Service Portal. Note that waivers are not routinely granted, and require documentation of compelling circumstances. Cancellation of NHSC Obligation The NHSC obligation will be cancelled in its entirety in the event of a participant's death . No liability will be transferred to the participant's heirs. 33 APPLICATION INFORMATI ON Application Deadline A complete online application must be submitted by 7 :30 PM E ST on March 30, 2015.
