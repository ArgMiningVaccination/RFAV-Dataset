Groundbreaking for the campus occurred two years later, and during the following year, Ogeechee Tech began offering its first credit program, Practical Nursing, with 25 students enrolled. Ogeechee Tech assumed the responsibility for offering Adult Literacy programs and administering the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) examination in 1989. Faculty and staff moved into the new 75,000 square foot, $6 million state-of-the-art facility Fall term of 1990, and additional program offerings began Spring term1991. Ogeechee Tech graduated its first class of nine Practi cal Nursing students in December of 1990. The opening of Ogeechee Tech co incided with the expansive growth of Georgia Southern University and the Statesboro area. In addition, the estab lishment of the Georgia State Lottery funded Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) financial aid program in 1993 was a contributing factor in the unprecedented growth of Ogeechee Tech. Ogeechee Tech experienced a $5.5 million expansion by adding three buildings\u2014a Health Sciences Building, a Child Enrichment Center, and a Horticulture Building in 1999. During this time, Ogeechee Tech also increased its services through the opening of the Screven County Learning Center in Sylvania. Ogeechee Tech offered its first Associate of Applied Technology (AAT) degree program in Industrial Manufacturing Technology Winter Semester 2000, with eight students enrolled, and in the fo llowing academic year offered AAT degrees in Accounting, Co mputer Information Systems, Early Childhood Care and Education, Funeral Service Education, Health Information Technology, Healthcare Management Technology, Marketing Management, Opticianry, and Secretarial Science. House Bill 1187, known as the A + Education Reform Act, enacted in 2000, changed the names of technical institutes in Georgia to technical colleges. On July 6th of that year, Ogeechee Technical Institute officially became Ogeechee Technical College. Ogeechee Tech awarded its first AAT degree in December 2000 in Early Childhood Care and Education. During the summe r of 2002, Ogeechee Tech opened the Evans County Learning Center. Student growth continued at Ogeechee Tech due largely to the addition of new programs, many of which are unique to DTAE, the state, and the region. These distinctive programs included certificate, diploma, a nd degrees in technical areas such as Funeral Service Education, Forensic Science Technology, and Opticianry. With the opening of the Occupational Studies Building in Fall 2003, a wider variety of programs, such as Agribusiness, Wildlife and Plantation Management, Geographical Information Systems Technology, Veterinary Technology, Culinary Arts, and Hotel, Restaurant and Tourism Management, enabled the college to further expand its offerings. In 2004, Ogeechee Tech paid tribute to the late Senator Joseph E. Kennedy for his role in the establishment of Ogeechee Technical Institute by dedicating the main building on campus as the Joseph E. Kennedy Building. On May 13, 2008, Governor Sonny Perdue signed legislation that officially changed the name of the Department of Technical and Adult Education. Effective July 1, 2008, the system became known as the Technical College System of Georgia. Governor Perdue also served as the keynote speaker for the 2008 Spring Commen cement at Ogeechee Technical College. Shortly thereafter, Laura \"Molly\" Bickerton, a student in the College's Radiologic Technology program, was selected as Georgia's technical college Student of the Year in the 37th annual Georgia Occupational Award of Leadership (GOAL) competition. In July of 2008, Ogeechee Technical College was awarded a Regional Law Enforcement Acad emy in Claxton, Georgia. The project, which involved five other technical colleges, allowed new law enforcement officers to receive their basic law enforcement training at a state technical college and obtain college credit at the same time. Nearby in Hagan, Ogeechee Technical College began construction of the Evans Technical Education Complex. The new complex included the Logistics and Public Safety Building, the Commercial Trucking Preventive Maintenan ce facility, and driving track for the Commercial Trucking program and emergency vehicle operators track for the Regional Law Enforcement Academy. Towards the end of 2008, amid a downturn in the economy, a reduction in state funds, and rising gas prices, Ogeechee Technical College joined other technical colleges in the state to institute a four day work week. The move reduced the cost of utilities without reducing any services to students. Another big change came at the beginning of 2009 when an Emergency Mass Notification Syst em for faculty, staff, and students was implemented. The new OTC-Alert system provided a way to send emergency warnings via cell phone and email messages. Despite a challenging economy, good things continued to happen at Ogeechee Tech. Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel was the keynote speaker at the 2009 commencement exercises and in an effort to offer better services to the students, Ogeechee Tech moved the Adult Education program to a new location adjacent to the main campus. In the fall of 2010, Governor Sonny Perdue returned to campus to speak at a ceremonial ground breaking for the new Health Science Building-North. 9 In 2011, amid changes to the HOPE scholarship, transitioning from quarters to semesters, moving to a tobacco-free campus, and challenging economic times, Ogeechee Tech once again celebrated having the Technical College System of Georgia's star student as local Georgia Occupational Award of Leadership winner, Alvie Coes, III, a Funeral Service Education student, was named state GOAL winner. Another accolade for the College was announced when Ogeechee Technical College was named the 2011 Technical College of the Year for the State of Geor gia. Determined by meeting benchmarks in a variety of critical areas, Ogeechee Tech earned the top spot over all the other Colleges in the State system. In May 2012, the College consolidated its facilities in Evans County. In an effort to re duce the cost of operating two separate facilities, the College ceased operations at the Evans County Workforce Development Center in Claxton. Adult Education classes and the Basic Law Enforcement program were transferred to the Evans Technical Education Complex joining the Commercial Truck Driving program. A continuing effort to provide new and needed programs of study keeps Ogeechee Tech in the forefront of meeting the educational demands of citizens in this region of Georgia. Enrollment growth of 10.3 percent from 2010 to 2011, and 4,470 students attending classes have proved repeatedly that the demand for Ogeechee Tech's se rvices is stronger than ever. With credit programs, c ontinuing education, GED\u00ae and literacy programs, and various other services, the College's commitment to meet the needs of the region continues. Mission Statement Ogeechee Technical College (OTC ), a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia, is a public institution of higher education that contributes to the economic, educational, and community development of its three-county service area of Bulloch, Evans, and Screven counties.

The President may waive the \"16 years of age\" requirement for secondary students who are participating in an articulated program of study. Required Academic Criteria A GED or high school diploma (verified by an official transcript including graduation date and diploma type) will be required for admission to Ogeechee Technical College unless otherwise specified by the program's standards. High School diplomas from unaccredited institutions, Certificates of Attendance or special education diplomas are not recognized for admission purposes. Students with diplomas from secondary schools located outside the United States must have their transcripts evaluated for equivalency by an approved outside evaluation organization (suggested agenci es are available through the Admissions Office). Applican ts who have successfully completed (C or better) a minimum of 30 semester or 45 quarter hours at the degree level may submit official transcripts from all previously attended colleges accredited by an accepted accrediting agency in lieu of a GED or high school diploma. In order to be accepted by a Technical College, the applicant must have been awarded a high school diploma from a secondary school that is on the TCSG approved accreditation agency list. Gr aduates of unaccredited high schools must obtain a GED\u00ae diploma. Applicants of home schools located in Georgia who did not attend a recognized accredited program must adhere to the following alternative path for admission: Submit a letter from the local superintendent's office verifying that (1) the parent or legal guardian notified the superintendent of intent to home school and (2) that the parent or legal guardian submitted the required attendance reports to the superintendent's office on a monthly basis as required by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 20-2-690. Submit annual progress reports or a final transcript for the equivalent of the home-schooled student's junior and senior years. The final progress report should include the graduation date. Applicants of home schools lo cated outside the state of Georgia who did not attend a recognized accredited program must adhere to the following alternative path for admission: Submit annual progress reports or a final transcript for the equivalent of the home-schooled student's junior and senior years. The final progress report should include the graduation date. Submit SAT or ACT scores that meet the TCSG system minimum requirements. The President may waive the GED/high school diploma requirement for secondary students or those pursuing a GED who are otherwise eligible to enroll in a specific program of study. Assessment The ability for a student to succeed in a program at Ogeechee Technical College is greatly determined by the math and language skills possessed by that student. Ogeechee Tech is committed to assisting each student to reach their maximum potential. All students applying for diploma, degree, and certificate programs must be assessed prior to acceptance to a prog ram of study. Students will then be admitted in acco rdance with the academic standards applicable to that program. Ogeechee Tech utilizes COMP ASS or ASSET, the TCSG- approved assessment instruments, when evaluating students for program readiness. However, in the place of COMPASS or ASSET, Ogeechee Tech may accept a student's official entrance sc ore on a validated assessment instrument (such as SAT, ACT), or Georgia High School Graduation Test in English/Language Arts if the scores meet the college program's required minimums. If a student's SAT, ACT, or Georgia High School Graduation Test in English/Language Arts scores do not meet the college program's minimums for regular admission, a student must be assessed using one of the TCSG-approved instruments. Assessment results will be valid for placement purposes for a peri od of 60 months and are transferable to any TCSG college. Official transcripts from a regionally or nationally accredited postsecondary ins titution recognized by the United States Department of Education documenting equivalent program-level English and math coursework successfully completed (C or better) may be used in lieu of completing the corresponding portion of the TCSG- approved assessment instrument. Placement Testing The COMPASS placement exam consists of a series of four tests: Writing, Reading, Mathematics, and Algebra. This test is an untimed, multiple choice examination given by computer. Required scores may be found in the Academic Programs section of this catalog. For applicants who are uncomfortable with ta king computerized tests or in certain other situations, Ogeechee Technical College 13 offers ASSET, another st ate approved instrument published by ACT. ASSET consists of a series of four tests: Writing, Reading, Numerical Skills, and Elementary Algebra. This test is a paper and pencil and multiple choice format with each section timed at 25 minutes. Elementary Algebra scores are required only for Associate Degrees and certain other programs of study. All other programs require a Numerical Skills score.

Applicants who have been previously enrolled at a postsecondary institution and desire entrance into one of the competitive admission programs (Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Echocardiography, Practical Nursing, Radiologic Technology, or Surgical Technology) must meet certain specific requirements listed in the Ogeechee Technical College Catalog and Student Handbook . Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screenings are not transferable. Students may be eligible for advanced placement through two methods: transfer cr edit and exemption credit. Transfer Credit Ogeechee Technical College recognizes previous postsecondary coursework by accepting credits earned from other regionally or nati onally accredited institutions that are applicable to the student's program of study. A student who presents credit for evaluation and transfer must be aware that the aw arding of credit does not guarantee that institutions subsequently attended by the student will accept those credits. Credit for courses received at an institution accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Technical College System of Georgia (TCS G) and whose entrance requirements and curriculum ar e equivalent to or greater than those of OTC will be cons idered for awar d of transfer credit. Credit may be granted for formal military schools, training and correspondence courses in accordance with the American Counc il on Education. Ogeechee Tech recognizes that it is necessary to establish reasonable and definitive policies for accepting transfer credit. The College developed these guidelines in accordance with the standard s set by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Admissions Officers. Ogeechee Tech distinguishe s between the acceptance of credit and the applicability toward program requirements. Applicability of credit toward a credential refers to the prerogative of the academic divisions to count specific credit toward fulfillment of graduation requirements. The Registrar determines the transferability of courses taken at other postsecondary institutions by considering the educational quality of the learning experience for which the students seeks transfer credit; the comparability of the nature, content, and level of learning experiences to the courses offered at Ogeechee Tech (the course is essentially the same content as the course to be taken at the College); and the appropriateness and applicability of the learning experience to the programs o ffered at Ogeechee Tech and how recently the occurred. The College established the following procedures to guid e the Registrar in awarding transfer credit: In order for the Registrar to evaluate credit, the students must submit official transcripts from all colleges to Ogeechee Tech. All official 17 transcripts must include final grades. The student must also complete and submit the Transfer/Articulated Credit Evaluation form requesting the evaluation of their transcript(s) to the Registrar. Students may receive transfer credit for courses for which they earned a C or better. The Registrar will not award tran sfer credit with grades below a C, including D, F, I, IP, W, WF, and WP. Due to the rapid changes in technology and technical information, program-specific courses will be considered for transfer credit in a program only if the coursework has been completed within the past five years (60 months). Technical courses that were taken five years prior to admission to Ogeechee Tech will be evaluated for technical currency for course co ntent by the program faculty. A student desiring consideration of credit for technical courses or e xperiences that are more than five years old can request transfer by exemption testing. Transfer credit will be considered without restriction of completion dates for those courses in academic disciplines. Examples of these courses include, but are not limited to, English, psychology, mathematics, physical sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences . The Registrar will not aw ard transfer credit for learning support coursework or other institutional courses such as college orientation courses taken at other colleges. The transfer credit is recorded as TRA, TRB, or TRC on the Ogeechee Tech transcript and is not included in the calculation of the semester, cumulative, or graduation grade point average. The third letter indicates the actual grade earned in the course. For competitive admission programs, grades for credit earned as transfer credit will be evaluated for GPA and calculated in the GPA under consideration for program admission. Students may access their records online through the College website via BannerWeb to verify the transfer credit awarded by the Registrar. If coursework is earned at a nationally accredited college, Ogeechee Tech reserves the right to evaluate instructor credentials applicable to the requested transfer coursework. A student who has attended a previous college and is eligible for transfer of cred it for English and math is not required to take the COMPASS placement exam. However, if the student for any reason takes the exam and scores indicate the need for a learning support class, the student forfeits evaluation of their transcript and the scores on the exam will determine placement, except in the case of a competitive admissions program. Students wishing to transfer from Ogeechee Tech to another college must contact that college directly to determine transfer of credit. Experiential Learnin g/Military Training Credit Credit may be awarded for education/training experiences in the Armed Services. Such experiences must be certified by the American Council on Education (identified in the Council's publication: Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services) or the official catalog of the Commun ity College of the Air Force or a similar document. The experiential learning will be evaluated by the program instructor along with the Registrar to determine the cour se competencies. Credit will be given on the basis of individual evaluation. Course information must be present on the Armed Forces transcript. Credible military experience must closely correspond to the course (s) in the Ogeechee Tech curriculum content and comp etencies. The time limit specified in the transfer cred it section also applies to the experiential learning. Professional Certification Ogeechee Technical College co nsiders credit awarded for non-collegiate educational pr ograms as recommended by the American Council on Ed ucation (ACE). ACE's National Guide to College Credit for Workforce Training and National Guide to Credit Recommendations for Non- collegiate Courses contain recommendations for experiential learning and professional examinations or certifications offered by other organizations separate of postsecondary educational institutions, including agencies offering professional certifications and the military. Documentation is required. The faculty member of the program in which the student is enrolled evaluates the documentation to determine if the experience meets or exceeds the program/course standards and makes a recommendation to the Registrar only if sufficient documentation is provided. Final determination is made by the Registrar. The process en sures all course work and outcomes are at the appropriate collegiate level. Foreign Earned Credit Credit may be awarded based upon an evaluation performed by an independent evaluation service. Recommended evaluation services are available in the Admissions Office. The Registrar will make the final decision regarding the award of transfer credit. Grade points will not be assigne d to transfer credit. Articulated Credit Articulated Credit is an option that allows high school students to receive advanced placement or exempt courses by taking articulated courses in high school. The student must submit a high school transcript showing the completed courses the student wa nts to receive credit from. Ogeechee Technical College must validate student competencies before awarding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering the final examination/exemption ex amination for the course to 18 be articulated. No fee shall be charged to students taking an exam to validate articulat ed credit from high school. The student must score equal to or higher than the required scores for the courses. The College shall bank credit after a high school student successfully passes the exemption exam required to articulate subject credit. This credit shall be applied to the student's record once he/she matriculates to the College. The high school student must matriculate within 2 years after high school graduation, unless dictated by programs standards. A list of approved courses is available from a high school counselor or the Admissions Office. Ogeechee Tech will honor local articulation agreements statewide when students move from one area of the state to another and will validate the credit by administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course being transferred. Articulated credit awarded will be indicated on transcript/permanent records by use of the letters \"AC.\" Institutional Exemption Exam A student may receive credit for courses by passing an exemption examination only if the student has never attempted the course nor made a grade of D or F in an equivalent course at OTC or another postsecondary institution. A student cannot withdraw from a course and register to take an exemption examination within the same term nor can a student take an exemption examination if he/she is currently registered for the course. Students wishing to pursue credit by examination must: Be admitted and enrolled in a program of study at Ogeechee Technical College; Be able to present evidence which would indicate that the student has the education, training, or work experience similar to that given in a course being challenged and not a faculty member from his/her program; Complete the Application for Credit by Examination form, and obtain approval from the student's academic advisor and the instructor responsible for administering the exam, the Academic Dean, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs; Take the application to the Business Office in Building 600 (JEK Annex) and pay the TCSG approved non-refundable fee for the examination; Present the application and a receipt of payment to the instructor responsible for administering the examination; and Earn a score of at least a \"C\". For competitive admissions programs, grades for credit earned by exemption exam will be evaluated for GPA and calculated into the GPA under consideration for program admission. The examination will be taken during the week of final examinations unless otherwise approved on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate Academic Dean. A grade of \"EX\" will be entered on the permanent record if the exemption exam is successfully comp leted. The hours for the exempted grades will not be computed in the grade point average. Exemption exams may be taken twice and must be a course or elective in the student's program of study. NOTE: The Academic Affairs Division determines which courses exemption exams may be given for. A list of courses is available in the Of fice of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Academic Affairs reserves the right to change the courses on this list at any time and without notice. Standardized Exam Credit Credit may be awarded based on nationally normed exams including, but not limited to, the following: CLEP - Credit will be awarde d for successful completion of any appropriate CLEP (College Level Examination Program) subject area examin ations. Credit should be awarded based on score recommendations of the Council on College Level Services. Advanced Placement Examinations - Credit will be awarded to students who have taken appropriate courses (determined equivalent to courses offered at the College) in high school and achieve a score of 3 or more on the Advanced Placement Examination. The Advanced Placement Examinations are offered by the College Entrance Examination Board. International Baccalaureate Cr edit- Credit will be awarded to students who have taken appropriate courses (determined equivalent to courses offered at a Technical College) in high school and achieve a score of 3 or more on the International Baccalaureate Examination. The IB Examinations are offered by the International Baccalaureate Examination Board Residence Requirements for Degree/Diploma Ogeechee Technical College re quires that a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the coursework of a particular program of study be completed at the College in order to be granted an award. Changing Program of Study If students change their program of study at Ogeechee Tech, any courses common to the original program of study and the new program of study are transferable, providing that the student received a minimum score of C for the course. 19 Transient Courses A transient student is a student who is currently enrolled at one postsecondary institution seeking to take classes at another postsecondary institution. At Ogeechee Tech, students must obtain permission from their program advisor before applying as a transient student to other postsecondary institutions through www.gvtc.org. Grading procedures for transient students are the same as for traditional students. Therefore, the transient student's grade will be sent from the host school to Ogeechee Tech (home school) for recording of the grade upon completion of the course. The grade beco mes a part of the student's permanent record. The grade will be recorded as a transfer credit. 20 CAMPUS SAFETY AND SECURITY EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION All emergencies should be reported to the receptionist at (912) 681-5664 or 5664 for internal calls on the main campus.

Satisfactory Academ ic Progress (SAP) To be eligible to receive Student Financial Aid (SFA) funds (PELL, FSEOG, FWS, Federal Direct Loans, HOPE); students must maintain satisfactory academic progress. Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) is required by the U.S. Department of Education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) mean s the student is proceeding in a positive manner toward fulfilling educational requirements. Students attending OTC must be in good academic standing and making satisfactory progress. OTC uses the following standards to monitor students' progress toward their diploma, degree, or certificate: Grade Point Average Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 to remain in good standing. A student's GPA will be mon itored at the end of each semester. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 is placed on financial aid warning for the next semester of attendance. This will allow the student one semester to increase the cumulative GPA to the satisfactory level. If, after one semester, the GPA remains below 2.0, the student will lose financial aid eligibi lity (placed on financial aid suspension). Students may receive financial aid while on warning. Students will not receive financial aid while on suspension . Maximum Time Frame There are a maximum number of hours that students may attempt in pursuing their program of study. All students must complete their educational objective within a maximum time frame of one and one half (150 percent) 25 times the length of the program in which they are enrolled. This means that once a student has attempted one and one half times the minimum number of credit hours necessary for completing program requirements, the student is ineligible to receive financial aid. Completion Rate In order for students to graduate within this maximum \"time frame\" of hours, at the e nd of each semester they are expected to have cumulatively completed at least 66.6% of their credit hours attempted. A student who at the end of any semester has not successfu lly completed 66.6% of the cumulative hours attempted will be placed on financial aid warning for the next semester of attendance. This will allow the student one semester to increase the cumulative completion rate to the satisfactory level. If, after one semester, the cumulative completion rate remains below 66.6%, the student will lose fi nancial aid eligibility (placed on financial aid suspension). Students may receive financial aid while on warning. Students will not receive financial aid while on suspension. Grades The following grades are calculated in the completion rate but do not count toward successful completion: I , W, WP, F, or WF. Repeat courses w ill be considered as any other class and both grades will be counted in both the GPA and completion rate. A grade of A*, B*, or C* will be considered satisfactory comp letion of a learning support course. A grade of D* an d F* will be considered unsatisfactory. Grades received for learning support courses are not calculated in the GPA, but the hours are calculated in the 66.6% cumulative completion rate. Transfer Students Transfer students accepted by Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) but not previously enrolled at OTC will be classified as maintaining Sa tisfactory Academic Progress for the first semester enrolled. Only classes transferred in will be used in the completion rate calculation. At the end of the first semester, the student's grades will be measured in accordance with the College's Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. Students who previously attended OTC, transferred to another school, and then returned to OTC, will have all OTC courses and courses transferred from other institutions calculated in the cumulative completion rate. Warning/Suspension If a student fails to meet the cumulative GPA, cumulative completion rate, or the maximum time frame standards at the end of a semester, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Warning. The student will continue to receive financial aid while on financial aid warning. However, if the student doe s not meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards by the end of the warning period, he/she will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. The student can continue taking courses while on financial aid suspension at the student's expense. Appeal of Financial Aid Suspension Students have the right to appeal their suspension of financial aid if they have mitigating circumstances that prevented them from making satisfactory academic progress. A student wishing to appeal financial aid suspension must do so in writing with supportive documentation and is only allowed three appeals. The form may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office or the financial aid website. The SAP Appeal form must be submitted at the Financial Aid Appeals Briefing. Dates and times of all Financial Aid Briefings are posted in the Financial Aid Office and on the Ogeechee Technical College (OTC) website. The SAP Appeals Reviewer will review the appeals. The SAP Appeals Reviewer will notify the student of the decision. The Reviewer's decision is final. Appeal Outcomes Students will receive one of three decisions when they appeal: 1. Denial - Students whose appeals are denied remain on suspension and will have to pay for their classes. 2. Probation OT - Students whose appeals are approved will have their financial aid reinstated for one semester. Students must meet SAP at the end of the next semester of enrollment. 3.

Student Organizations Students at Ogeechee Technical College are encouraged to become active in career and technical student organizations. Part of each student's education is the development of social, cultural, and educational talents outside the classroom through participation in a variety of activities offered on campus. Student leadership organizations bring together students interested in specific career and technical fields, providing them with opportunities to meet new people and make new friends in a leadership-building environment, develop professional workplace skills, and learn from various activities, lectures, and events. The supervision and coordination of student activities and organizations are the responsibility of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Student organizations must be officially recognized by the College. Official recognition requires that the purpose and proposed activities are clearly related to the educational goals and mission of the College. Procedures for establishing new organizations can be found in the Guidelines for Student Organizations and Activities , available from the Vice President for Student Affairs and online. Membership in Organizations Eligibility for membership or active participation in student organizations is limited to currently enrolled students at Ogeechee Technical College. Eligibility to serve as an officer for an acad emic year or in an official capacity in a student organization is restricted to full-time, currently enrolled students who are not on academic probation. Any questions concerning eligibility for membership or holding office in a student organization are subject to final determination by the Vice President for Student Affairs or designee. Current Active Clubs and Organizations: Dental Assisting Club GPS and Mapping Society National Technical Honor Society (NTHS) Phi Beta Lambda (PBL) Radiologic Technology Club Recreational League Sports Skills USA Student Chapter of the National Association of Veterinary Technicians in America (SCNAVTA) Student Chapter of the Wildlife Society Student Leadership Council (SLC) The National Society of Lead ership and Success (NSLS) GOAL The Georgia Occupational Award of Leadership (GOAL) program focuses on excellen ce in technical education. Outstanding students attending Georgia's technical colleges and divisions are recognized for academic excellence and personal achievement. The first phase of GOAL takes place at the college level. College instructors identify their most promising students and nominate them for GOAL based on academic achievement and personal leadership. As nominees move through an interview and screening process, the college's top student is selected to represent their college and community. Then, all college GOAL winners compete at the regional level. Each regional competition will select three students (there are three regions), so nine semi-finalists will compete at the state level in Atlanta. The state level competition involved another round of interviews as the nine semi-finalists receive individual consideration from a panel of judges. From this outstanding group of students, the judges will select one student, the state GOAL winner, to serve as an ambassador for technical education in Georgia. Ogeechee Technical College's 2011 GOAL winner won the prestigious title of 2011 state GOAL winner. Along with this title the student won many awards including a brand new Chevrolet vehicle. The state GOAL winner is an ambassador for the Technical College System of Georgia promoting the system throughout the state. 34 POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Student Conduct (Student Rights and Responsibilities) I. Policy Academic institutions exist for the transmission of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, the development of students, and the well-being of society. Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the attainment of these goals. As members of this academic community, students are encouraged to devel op the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for knowledge. Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic conditions in the classroom, on the campus, other college sites, and in the community. Students are expected to exercise their freedom with responsibility. As members of the academic community, students are subject to the obligations which accrue to them by virtue of this membership. As members of the larger community of which the college is a part, students are entitled to all rights and protection accorded them by the laws of the community. By the same token, students are also subject to all laws, the enforcement of which is the responsibility of duly constituted authorities. When students violate laws, they may incur penalties prescribed by legal authorities. In such instances, college discipline will be initiated if the presence of the student on campus is considered a possible threat to persons or property, or if that person's presence may disrupt the educational process of the college. However, when a student's violation of the law also adversely affects the college's recognized educa tional objectives, or violates the college's Student Code of Conduct, the college will enforce its own regulations. When students violate college regulations, they are subject to disciplinary action by the college whether or not their conduct violates the law. It is the policy of the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) and Ogeechee Technical College to provide technical and adult education programs for the people of Georgia. TCSG's technical colleges must provide opportunities for intellectual, emotional, social, and physical growth. Ogeechee Technical College students assume an obligation to act in a manner compatible with the fulfillment of the mission. The technical college community recognizes its responsibility to provide an atmosphere conducive to growth. With these principles in mind, the Technical College System of Georgia establishes this Student Code of Conduct. Generally, technical college jurisdiction and discipline shall be limited to conduct which occurs on technical college premises, off-campus classes, activities or functions sponsored by the technical college, an examination or any other written or oral work submitted for evaluation and/or a grade, or which otherwise adversely affects members of the techni cal college community and/or the pursuit of the technical college's objectives.

OTC instructs and ev aluates students on work ethics in all programs of stud y. Ten work ethics traits are defined as essential for student success. The ten traits are appearance, attendance, attitude, character, communication, cooperation, organizational skills, productivity, respect and teamwork. The definitions for these traits have been integrated into the standards for each program offered at OTC. In a designated introductor y course in each program, instructors define and list the work ethics traits. A work ethics grade will be given in designated program capstone course. Program capstone course instructors will employ student evaluation methods that measure all work ethics traits. These methods will be documented and communicated to the enrolled students. Instructors will provide feedback to students with clear directions for remedial action prior to the final evaluation. A separate grade for work ethics in the capstone course will appear on students' transcripts. Grade Reports Final grades are recorded by in structors. Official grades are posted to the student's transcript via BannerWeb. Academic Appeals Ogeechee Technical College faculty and administrative staff have the right and responsibility to exercise professional judgment in making decisions about student performance and progress. Th e College is accountable for setting and maintaining standards of academic performance and is committed to ensuring stud ents are treated fairly in regard to all matters that relate to academic performance and progress. A student will be provided with a fair opportunity to have decisions that are believed by the student to negatively impact academic performance and progress reviewed in accordance with policies and procedures established by the College. Informal If a student believes that a basis exists for appealing an academic decision regarding a grade which prevents progression in a program of study, that student should first attempt to resolve the matter informally through discussion with the instructor who made the decision. A student has five (5) working days to discuss the academic decision. If no resolution can be reached within these five (5) working days, then the student will have another five (5) working days to discuss the concern with the Dean for Academic Affairs. The expectation is that the difference of opinion is to be resolved as closely as possible to the level at which it originated, and as quickly as is possible with careful review. It is only when a disagreement cannot be resolved through this informal process that a formal appeal of the academic decision should be made. A student may seek advice from a counselor for support and direction. Formal Once a decision has been made that the informal process has not resulted in resolution, formal procedures will begin. Written notification to the Dean for Academic Affairs must be made regarding the decision under question. The Dean for A cademic Affairs, upon completion of his/her review (course outline, documentation related to the student's progress, transcript, summary of events, etc.) may uphold, modify, or reverse the academic decision. The D ean for Academic Affairs will notify the student, the instructor, and the Registrar (if necessary) in writing of his/her decision with a rationale for the decision. If any party believes that the decision is not fair or reasonable, the decision may be appealed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. This gives the opportunity to ensure that all necessary and relevant information, documentation, opinion, and argu ment are fairly presented. The decision of the Vice Presid ent for Academic Affairs is final. Repeating Courses By registering for a course for which the student has already received credit, a student forfeits the previous credit in that course for grad uation purposes. The student's official grade for graduation purposes in the course(s) will be the last one earned on repetition. Although all grades remain on the official academic record, only the final attempt will be calculated for the purpose of meeting graduation requirements. For graduation purposes, a student must have a graduation GPA of a 2.0 and a cumulative GPA of 2.0. A student who fails or who does not earn a passing grade as required for courses specified in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook within two attempts will not be allowed to repeat that course for one year and will be allowed to retake a third time on a space-available basis only. Before retaking a course the third time, the student must complete any remediation assigned by the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs. A student may request from the appropriate Dean an exemption to this requirement if the student feels that additional information should be considered. Academic Probation and Suspension Students must maintain a minimum of a 2.0 cumulative grade point average to be in satisfactory academic standing. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0 will be placed on academic probation for the next academic semester. A student is subject to suspension for one semester if the cumulative grade point average is less than a 2.0 dur ing the semester enrolled on academic probation. Studen ts will be advised and counseled as to academic defi ciencies and given official notification of academic prob ation/suspension status. 59 Academic probation or suspen sion is indicated on the student's transcript via BannerWeb and recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Academic Transcript Request Process Students can receive an un official transcript via BannerWeb. The first official transcript for a student is provided free of charge. A fee of $5.00 will be charged for each additional official transc ript, which must be paid before the transcript is released. Transcripts will not be releas ed externally without the student's written consent unless as directed by law to comply. (Transcripts will be released in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. However, every reasonable attempt will be made to notify the student in advance of the compliance.) An academic transcript will be issued within three (3) business days of receiving a written request. The Academic Transcript Request form may be obtained in the Registrar's Office or on the Ogeechee Tech website using the BannerWeb electronic request/signature. If the student is unable to come to the Registrar's Office or download the form, Ogeechee Technical College will accept written consent in the form of a letter (either mailed or faxed) from the student. Enrollment Verification Students requiring verification for insurance, loan deferments, military I.D., past and current enrollment, and degree(s) earned can now access this information through the Self-Service program with the National Student Clearinghouse. Ogeechee Techni cal College has authorized the National Student Clearinghouse to provide enrollment verification certifications for students through its Web-based Student Self-Service program. Student Self-Service enables students to print official enrollment verification certifications on demand through their BannerWeb account at www.ogeecheetech.edu. Instru ctions are located in the Registrar's Office and online. Verification of enrollment status is based on the number of semester credit hours for which a student is or was enrolled. Full-time students carry 12 or more credit hours, three-quarter students carry ni ne to eleven credit hours, half-time students carry six to eight credit hours, and less than half-time students carry one to five credit hours. Withdrawing from a Course or the College Students withdrawing from courses or the College must complete an Application for Withdrawal form, which may be obtained from the Student Affairs Center, academic advisor, or the Counseling and Retention Coordinator. The effective date of the withdrawal is the last date the student attended or the last date of academic activity. The impact a withdrawal has on the student's academic record is determined on a course-by-course basis. In certain cases, the Counselor or Registrar may act on behalf of the student in completing the withdrawal process. Typically, this would occur in cases involving death, serious injury or illness, or formal requests to do so. Failure to attend classes does not constitute an official withdrawal. Students who fail to continue attending class and who do not complete an Application for Withdrawal form may be awarded a withdrawal-failing (WF) grade by the instructor. The instructor must still report the last date the student attended or the last date of academic activity to comply with the Federal Refund Policy. Students who withdraw from a course and have attended 60% or less of the course w ill receive a \"W\". Students who withdraw from a course and have attended more than 60% of the course will be issued a \"WF\" if the student was failing or a \"WP\" if the student was passing upon withdrawing or being dropped from the course. The 60% attendance date for each term is posted on the Campus Calendar located online at www.ogeecheetech.edu. If a student is called to active duty during a semester, he/she will be issued a WM, Withdrew Military. Ogeechee Technical College calculates earned Title IV federal fund amounts based on attendance. A student receiving Title IV federal fund s, such as loans and the Pell Grant, and withdraws prior to attending sixty percent (60%) of the semester, will only receive the earned amount. Since choosing to drop a course is a serious academic decision that may affect a student's progress towards a degree or a student's financial aid status, a student should consult with the in structor of the c ourse, the academic advisor, and a financial aid advisor before making this decision. Limited Withdrawals Students may withdraw from a maximum of three (3) courses at the College. If a student wants to withdraw from a course after he/she has accumulated three \"W\" grades, he/she may elect to receive a \"withdrawal-failing\" (WF) grade for the course or remain in the course. The grade of \"WF\" is calculated as an \"F\" for GPA purposes. Students are encouraged to verify the official number of withdrawals on their record as indicated in Banner prior to processing a withdrawal. Students may not exercise the right to withdraw to avoid sanction for academic dishonesty. It is the responsibility of the student to complete the withdrawal proce ss. A withdrawal is official when it is received and processe d by the Registrar's Office. The following types of withdrawals do not count against the limit of three course withdrawal (\"W\") grades: Exceptions Hardship withdrawals Medical or mental health withdrawals Military withdrawals Withdrawals during the first three days of the semester Withdrawals taken in semesters before Fall Semester 2013. Withdrawals taken at other institutions. Hardship Withdrawals Procedure 60 A student who has an emergency that prevents him/her from completing all classes for that term may request a Hardship Withdrawal through the Withdrawal Exemption Committee. Students must contact the Counseling and Retention Coordinator to withdraw them from all of their current semester classes. Students ar e strongly encouraged to contact their instructors by phone and/or email to notify them of their intentions to withdraw. Students must provide hardship documentation to the Withdrawal Exception Committee, including a letter from the student explaining the circumstances along with supporting documentation such as the following: for a death in the immedi ate family, a verifiable obituary; for a serious illness in the immediate family, documentation recommending withdrawal from a physician on the physician's letterhead signed by the physician (documentation on a prescription pad is unacceptable); for a workpl ace change, documentation from the employer on the company's letterhead. The hardship withdrawal process cannot begin until both the students' written permission and the supporting documentation have been received and verified. In cases where the student is petitioning to change a regular withdrawal to a hardship withdrawal, the actual assigned grade (\"W\") will not change; if the petition is granted, that withdrawal will not count towards the Limited Withdrawal policy. Medical Withdrawal Procedure A student who has an injury or illness that prevents the completion of all classes for that term may request a Medical Withdrawal through the Withdrawal Exemption Committee. Students must contact the Counseling and Retention Coordinator to withdraw them from all of their current semester classes. Students ar e strongly encouraged to contact their instructors by phone and/or email to notify them of their intention to withdraw. Students must provide medical documentation recommending withdrawal from a physician on the physician's letterhead si gned by the physician (documentation on a prescription pad is unacceptable). The Withdrawal Exception Committee will verify the authenticity of the physician's letterhead. Per Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) the Counseling and Retention Coordinator is not permitted to discuss a student's medical issues with instructors. (In some clinical programs, the student may subsequently be required to submit medical documentation to their program advisor or/and instructor prior to enrolling in future coursework as verification that the student is eligible to return to class.) If the documentation proves to be untruthful, the College reserves the right not to grant the request or to revoke the withdrawal. In cases where the student is petitioning to change a regular withdrawal to a medical withdrawal, the actual assigned grade (\"W\") will not change; if the petition is granted, that withdrawal will not count towards the Limited Withdrawal policy. Military Withdrawal Procedure A student who is called to active duty during a semester and cannot complete all courses for the semester may request a military withdrawal through the Withdrawal Exemption Committee. Students must contact the Counseling and Retention Coordinator to withdraw them from all of their current semester classes. Students ar e strongly encouraged to contact their instructors by phone and/or email to notify them of their intentions to withdraw. Students must provide the appropriate military documentation to the Withdrawal Exception Committee, including a letter from the student explaining the circumstances. The military withdrawal process cannot begin until both the student's written permission and the supporting documentation have been received and verified. In cases where the student is petitioning to change a regular withdrawal to a mil itary withdrawal, the actual assigned grade (\"W\") will not change; if the petition is granted, that withdrawal will not count towards the Limited Withdrawal policy. Reinstatement Procedure Students that are dropped from a course for non-payment or non-attendance may request to be reinstated into the course by following the steps outlined below. 1. Students must request to be reinstated with the instructor of the course that he/she was dropped from. 2. If the instructor approves, the instructor will request reinstatement on behalf of the student to their respective Dean for Academic Affairs. 3. If the Dean for Academic Affairs approves, an email or memo will be sent to the Registrar's Office to acknowledge the approval fo r reinstatement into the specified course. 4. Once the student has been reinstated, the Registrar's Office notifies the instructor and student via email. Students are limited to one reinstatement per course each semester. Students may drop and add courses during the first three days of each term without having to request a reinstatement. If a student is dropped for non-payment 61 after the beginning of a term, he/she will have to pay tuition and fees in full at the time of reinstatement. Graduation Requirements In order to be eligible for graduation, a degree, diploma, or certificate student must m eet all of the following requirements: Have completed all course and credit hour requirements as pres cribed in the state standard and/or outlined by each department, Have achieved regular admission status, Have a graduation GPA of 2.0 for the program of study in which they are enrolled, Have a cumulative GPA of 2.0, Have completed at least 25% of total semester credit hours at Ogeechee Technical College, Have satisfied all financial obligations to the College, and Have completed an Application for Program of Study Completion form by the mid-term of his/her final semester.
