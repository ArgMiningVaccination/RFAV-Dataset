I have been able to significantly reduce my heart medications and have incorporated tai chi into my weekly regimen, which helps create balance in my life and improves my sleep. These are all very doable lifestyle changes and have become second nature for me. We learn to address the root cause of our ailments instead of solely treating the symptoms.\" \u2014 Dannie Cassell Grateful patientUniversity of California, Irvine2 Integrative Health for the Future The Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute is pioneering a multidisciplinary, evidence-based, integrative approach to health that informs and underpins the Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences. Our transformative model combines the best conventional medical practices with the most effective complementary therapies to promote optimal health through all the stages of life. In partnership with colleagues in the Samueli College and UCI Health, we are expanding our scope so that more people will benefit from our trailblazing research, bold educational programs and compassionate, whole person care. Working together, we are reimagining the future of health for you, our community and people across the globe. The Samueli Institute's distinguished founding executive director, Shaista Malik, M.D., Ph.D., M.P .H., FACC, and our talented team are guided by an overarching vision: Shaista Malik, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., FACC3 UCI BRILLIANT FUTURE to be the preeminent national and international leader in integrative health sciences research, education and clinical care. Meeting the Demand for Integrative Health A survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 33.2 percent of adults in the United States and 11.6 percent of U.S. children age 4 to 17 used complementary health approaches in 2012. These findings reinforce what we have observed in our own practice: People are turning to integrative medicine to improve the quality of their lives. At the Samueli Institute, we provide patients the compassionate, whole person care they seek. The comprehensive treatments that we offer are uniquely reinforced by the research capabilities of UCI, where scientists from across the campus collaborate to advance our understanding of complementary approaches to health and well- being. By establishing best practices, we speed the incorporation of preventive and therapeutic strategies into the healthcare system and expedite insurance coverage of complementary approaches on a large scale. Treating the Whole Person The approach to wellness that guides our practices embraces the physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual health of individuals and populations. Holistic therapies are central to our transdisciplinary work. Every patient who visits the Samueli Institute receives an individualized treatment plan designed to restore health, improve the quality of life and prevent disease. These customized plans may include nutritional counseling, exercise, yoga, massage, mindfulness, acupuncture and a variety of other healing practices that complement conventional therapies. Our health sciences partners in the School of Medicine, the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing, the planned School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and the planned School of Population and Public Health share our integrated, patient-focused commitment to health and wellness. We are creating a healthcare delivery system that will provide patients with high-quality integrative health services. University of California, Irvine4 An integrative approach to health is already being woven into the fabric of UCI Health. For example, we are using integrative approaches to decrease the overuse of opioid medications prescribed to relieve pain. Over time, we will develop a clinical care model that incorporates integrative health principles into every patient visit in the UCI Health system to foster wellness, prevent illness and treat patients in an effective manner, while also minimizing unwanted side effects. These aspirations propel us forward. Speaking on behalf of the team at the Samueli Institute, Malik says, \"We would like to be known as thoughtful healthcare leaders who see the whole person and emphasize not only expanding the years one lives or the life span but also increasing the number of healthy years during that time and focusing on the health span.\" Our service mission to discover, teach and heal sets the stage for innovation on multiple fronts. Discovering New Frontiers of Knowledge Under the auspices of the Samueli Institute, investigators conduct rigorous translational and clinical research to answer fundamental questions about how complementary therapies work and how they can be optimized to heal patients. Researchers collaborate on a wide range of topics with colleagues across the UCI campus and the UC system, and have received grants totaling more than $15 million from the National Institutes of Health. With more than two decades of continuous NIH funding, our teams have studied issues related to heart health, including electroacupuncture in cardiovascular conditions, precision medicine in heart disease and the use of IV chelation therapy. Our researchers have explored the effectiveness of integrative healing therapies to treat patients who experience pain, stress or depression after neurosurgery. Another promising area of study has focused on electroacupuncture treatments in post-menopausal women and previously unidentified metabolic changes, a way to address how acupuncture treats the underlying causes of hypertension. 5 University of California, Irvine6 Patients in our clinic and around the world stand to benefit from the groundbreaking research our teams conduct. With your support, we will broaden the focus of our vital work and accelerate the incorporation of integrative therapies into routine medical practices, while also paving the way for insurance companies to reimburse patients for these therapies. Teaching Evidence-Based Methods We are educating the next generation of health sciences professionals to transcend current disciplinary boundaries. Students and healthcare providers learn about an integrative model of healthcare that includes complementary healing practices. Our classes address both the benefits and the risks associated with new approaches. Through all our programs, we strive to educate a diverse health workforce that includes members of underrepresented populations. Several novel programs that we have developed reinforce our commitment to educate the integrative healthcare leaders of the future: Health Education to Advance Leaders in Integrative Medicine (HEAL-IM): Students in the UCI School of Medicine now have the option of participating in HEAL-IM, a program designed to provide future generations of physicians with additional training in evidence-based, compassionate, whole person care and prevention. Naturopathic Medicine Residency Program: Launched in October 2016, this is the only program of its kind at an allopathic medical school. In 2017, we added a naturopathic residency track in integrative community health. Naturopathic medicine focuses on nutrition and the use of botanicals in a complementary nature to conventional medicine. Our program offers a unique and robust residency curriculum and has been designed to meet high standards in patient care for post-graduate training for naturopathic graduates. We plan to increase enrollment and expand research training time during residency in the years ahead. 7 UCI BRILLIANT FUTURE \"We are very fortunate to have naturopathic medicine at Serve the People Community Health Center, which is an otherwise inaccessible resource to our underserved patients. The most meaningful result of the naturopathic program has been the tremendous quality of service provided to our patient community. The physicians have connected with our patients to provide quality interactions that are educational, and most importantly, they delivered care with empathy to our patients' sensitive needs with understanding. This is what makes the naturopathic medicine program truly successful.\" \u2014 Isela Soriano Healthcare Operations Manager, Serve the People Community Health CenterUniversity of California, Irvine8 Integrative Medicine Tracks: The Samueli Institute continues to support and serve as the clinical rotation site for graduate medical education. The integrative medicine track in the UCI Family Medicine residency is the most popular track among family medicine residents. A new integrative medicine training track has been started for psychiatry residents in the UCI Department of Psychiatry. Integrative Nursing Program: In collaboration with UCI Health, the Samueli Institute is launching an integrative certification program that will eventually train all our inpatient and ambulatory nurses and medical assistants to use integrative methods at the patient's bedside. Integrative Health Coaching Program: We are working with the Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing to develop an integrative health coaching program that will train coaches to help individuals achieve their personal health and wellness goals.In addition to educating health sciences students and practitioners, we share best practices with members of the local community. Our curriculum introduces participants to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), yoga and tai chi. Culinary classes, which we offer at UCI's Family Health Center in Santa Ana and on campus at the Anteater Recreation Center, attract both medical students and members of the underserved community. Students in local elementary and high schools who take the nutrition classes and mindfulness programs that we are developing will learn how to optimize their own health and well-being. Your philanthropic gift will enable us to continue sharing our knowledge with UCI students and members of the community who wish to lead healthy, mindful lives. 9 UCI BRILLIANT FUTUREHealing Patients The clinical program at the Samueli Institute grew tenfold in the three-year period from 2015 to 2018, a testament to the valuable role we play in the community. The increasing demand for our integrative health services has led to long waiting lists for healthcare providers who treat the whole person. Patients seek our services at every stage of wellness. If you are a healthy patient, our clinicians will help you enhance your overall well- being and identify risk factors to prevent or delay the onset of specific diseases. If you are coping with chronic conditions or major medical events, our practitioners will also help you improve your health. To better serve all our patients, we are planning to relocate to a new, state-of-the-art facility on the UCI campus in 2022. We will occupy approximately 30,000 square feet inside the planned Susan and Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences building. Our clinical space will more than triple in size, allowing us to accommodate a greater number of healthcare providers and expand the range of special programs we offer. We are also dedicated to healing individuals and populations throughout the region. In January 2018, we established our first free community integrative clinic at Serve the People, a community health center in Santa Ana, Calif. Underserved individuals in Santa Ana now have healthcare access to naturopathic services, yoga therapy, dietary guidance and lifestyle education. \"There are countless times while rotating in the hospital that I have witnessed how patients' nutritional standards have directly benefited or harmed their overall health and recovery. It is easy to tell patients to eat healthier and hope that they do, but taking the time to educate them through what I learned in the culinary medicine elective has been a priceless means of providing patient- centered care.\" \u2014 Sean Thompson , medical student, UCI School of Medicine \"The MBSR class at the Susan Samueli Institute has made a big difference in my life \u2014 every day! Now, rather than rushing through breakfast, a morning walk, a conversation or anything at all, I have become truly aware of what's going on and can appreciate each day and each moment much more. This keeps me calm and not feeling stressed. I'm very grateful for having taken this course!\" \u2014 Judy Brandt , MBSR student University of California, Irvine10 11 UCI BRILLIANT FUTUREYour support for clinical care will enable us to hire more providers, expand current clinical services and establish several new programs with a specific focus, such as nutrition, mind/body wellness, botanical medicine, pain management, and medical subspecialties, including cardiology, gastroenterology and oncology.
