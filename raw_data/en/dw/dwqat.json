Heatclearing and detoxification are theories of traditional Chinese medicine meaning that <em>R. isatidis</em> could treat febrile disease by clearing heat and reducing swelling. Polysaccharides isolated from <em>R. isatidis</em> by water extraction and alcohol precipitation have exhibited numerous biological activities, including antiviral and immunomodulatory effects.

RAW264.7 cells treated with different concentrations of RIP displayed different morphological changes, from a round shape and aggregation to polygonal shape and dispersion in a dosedependent manner. In the 5 mg/ml RIPtreated group, the changes of morphology were as same as the lipopolysaccharidetreated group. RIP also significantly enhanced the release of nitric oxide as shown by Griess method, and the secretion of TNF and IL6 in RAW264.7 cells was confirmed by ELISA assay. Western blotting revealed a significant increase of tolllike receptor4 (TLR4) in RIPtreated RAW264.7, suggesting that TLR4 may be associated with the immunomodulatory mechanism of RIP. Animal experiments also demonstrated through ELISA assays a significant increase in IFN and IL10 levels after the splenocytes of RIPimmunized mice were stimulated by inactivated herpes simplex virus type 2.

China - Published online on: October 4, 2021 This article is mentioned in: Abstract Introduction Immune modulation serves an important role in maintaining human body health. The use of immunomodulators can enhance host defence, especially for patients with cancer and those that are immunocompromised ( [1](#b1-ETM-22-6-10841)). Several types of immunomodulators have been identified, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IFN- and numerous components extracted from microorganisms, such as glucose polymers from the cell wall of certain pathogenic bacteria and collagenases of bacterial metabolites ( [2-5](#b2-ETM-22-6-10841%20b3-ETM-22-6-10841%20b4-ETM-22-6-10841%20b5-ETM-22-6-10841)). In recent decades, natural polysaccharides isolated from Chinese herbal medicines have also attracted much attention in the biopharmaceutical field and, in certain cases, have been revealed to improve the immune function of patients. It was reported that the polysaccharides isolated from Chinese herbal medicines are relatively non-toxic and do not cause significant side effects compared with the immunomodulating polysaccharides derived from microorganisms and chemical synthesis ( [1](#b1-ETM-22-6-10841), [6](#b6-ETM-22-6-10841)). Polysaccharides are a group of natural macromolecular composed of >10 monosaccharides that are linked by glycosidic bonds. Since the 1990s, scientists have identified that numerous water-soluble polysaccharides extracted from plants can promote T-cell proliferation ( [7](#b7-ETM-22-6-10841)). A number of studies have documented that polysaccharides can exhibit a variety of biological functions, including immune regulation, anti-inflammatory responses, anti-viral functions and anti-tumor effects, regulating the immune system in numerous ways ( [8-12](#b8-ETM-22-6-10841%20b9-ETM-22-6-10841%20b10-ETM-22-6-10841%20b11-ETM-22-6-10841%20b12-ETM-22-6-10841)). Similar to other Chinese herbal medicines, Radix isatidis (R. isatidis) polysaccharides (RIPs) exhibit immunomodulatory effects. R. isatidis is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese herbal medicines from the roots of Isatis indigotica Fort. (family, Cruciferae) and has been used for thousands of years in China ( [13](#b13-ETM-22-6-10841)). The sliced and dried roots are manufactured into granules or syrups, then dissolved or diluted in hot water to treat febrile disease by clearing heat and reducing swelling ( [13](#b13-ETM-22-6-10841)). Different chemical constituents of R. isatidis have been isolated, including alkaloids, nucleosides, amino acids, organic sterols, flavonoids, lignanoids, volatile oils and polysaccharides ( [14](#b14-ETM-22-6-10841)). Among these, RIP has been demonstrated to broad antiviral activity ( [15-18](#b15-ETM-22-6-10841%20b16-ETM-22-6-10841%20b17-ETM-22-6-10841%20b18-ETM-22-6-10841)), RIP regulates the immune system by activating dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and lymphocytes ( [23](#b23-ETM-22-6-10841), [24](#b24-ETM-22-6-10841)). RIPs can promote the proliferation of NK cells and the expression of IFN- and TNF- ( [23](#b23-ETM-22-6-10841), [24](#b24-ETM-22-6-10841)). RIPs are also able to accelerate and secretory function of monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( [21](#b21-ETM-22-6-10841)). Furthermore, in immunocompromised mice, RIP can improve the phagocytosis capability of mononuclear macrophages, the transformation of lymphocytes and the production of IL-2 and IFN- ( [19](#b19-ETM-22-6-10841)). RIP has also been demonstrated to enhance the immune effects of vaccines, leading to adaptive and innate immunity ( [25](#b25-ETM-22-6-10841), [26](#b26-ETM-22-6-10841)). An -glucan isolated from R. isatidis, immunized with the H1N1 influenza virus and recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in mice, can positively affect antibody levels and stimulate macrophages proliferation and TNF- secretion isolated from R. isatidis, can also induce T-lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen and high levels of cytokine secretion in mice immunized with inactivated rabies virus ( [26](#b26-ETM-22-6-10841)). In a previous study, purified RIP was demonstrated to induce a T helper type 1 (Th1) cell-biased adaptive immune response of mice immunized receptors ( [28](#b28-ETM-22-6-10841)). Among TLRs, TLR-4 natural polysaccharide-induced activations of macrophages, dendritic cells and B Angelica sinensis polysaccharide ( [8](#b8-ETM-22-6-10841), [29](#b29-ETM-22-6-10841)). It is currently unknown whether TLR-4 is also a receptor of RIPs. Therefore, the role of TLR-4 in RIPs-induced activation of RAW264.7 cells was investigated in the present study. The present study aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of RIP on RAW264.7 macrophages and murine splenocytes, including the activation of RAW264.7 cells and the expression of immune-related cytokines, and attempted to identify the mechanism of immunomodulation. These findings could provide scientific evidence for the use of RIP as an immunomodulator.

RAW264.7 macrophages were purchased from Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of The Chinese Academy of Sciences. A total of 16 specific-pathogen-free female BALB/c mice (age, 8 weeks; weight, 20-22 g; Sino-British SIPPR/BK Lab Animal Ltd.) were kept in a temperature-controlled room (temperature, 18-29C; relative humidity, 40-70%) under a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. All animal procedures were approved and carried out in accordance with the Institutional Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences [Hangzhou, China; approval no. SYXK (Zhe) 2017-0008]. RIP preparation RIP was extracted by water extraction and alcohol precipitation. The extraction procedure was performed as previously described ( [27](#b27-ETM-22-6-10841)). R. isatidis (2 g) powder in 30 ml distilled water was incubated in a thermostatic water bath at 55C overnight. Following filtration through defatted cotton, the suspension was centrifuged 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4C by Allegra X-12 centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) to remove residues. The supernatant was concentrated via rotary evaporation and precipitated with 95% alcohol for 72 h at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4C. The precipitates were redissolved and dialyzed for 48 h at room temperature. The non-dialysate was lyophilized using Heto PowerDry LL3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at -40C for 48 h to obtain RIPs. The carbohydrate content of RIP was determined using the phenol-sulfuric acid method with glucose as a standard, as previously described ( [30](#b30-ETM-22-6-10841)). The protein content of RIP was determined using a Bradford Assay with BSA (cat. no. C506031; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.; 25-2,000 \u00b5g/ml) as a standard. Cell culture RAW264.7 cells cultured in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS 37C saturated humidity. RIP cytotoxicity RIP cytotoxicity was quantified using cell viability. RAW264.7 cells (2x104 cells/well) were cultured at for 24 h and under saturated humidity, and then incubated at 37C with different concentrations of RIP (0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/ml) in high-glucose DMEM for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter 96\u00aeAQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay. Briefly, 40 \u00b5l/well CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution reagent was added to the 96-well plates and incubated for 4 h at 37C. The optical density (OD) value at a wavelength of 490 nm was analysed using Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). High-glucose DMEM alone served as Morphological change of RAW264.7 cells RAW264.7 cells (1x106 cells/well) were cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h at 37C and 5% CO2 under saturated humidity. Cells were then treated with different concentrations of RIP (0, 0.08, 0.32, 1.25 and 5 mg/ml) or LPS (2 \u00b5g/ml) for 24 h. Morphological changes were observed using a phase-contrast microscope (magnification, 20x; Olympus Corporation). Nitric oxide (NO) production RAW264.7 cells (1x106 cells/well) were cultured six-well plates with 3 ml 10% FBS high-glucose DMEM for 24 h at 37C and CO2 under saturated humidity. RAW264.7 cells were then incubated at 37C with different concentrations of RIP (0, 0.08, 0.32, 1.25 and 5 mg/ml) or LPS (2 \u00b5g/ml) for 24 h. NO production in cells was measured by the Griess method according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer ( [31](#b31-ETM-22-6-10841)). Briefly, the cell culture media of the six-well plates were centrifuged (200 x g for 5 min) at 4C, the supernatant (50 \u00b5l) was distributed in 96-well plate, reagent I and 50 \u00b5l/well Griess reagent II were added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance was read at 540 nm using Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer, and the concentrations of NO2- were determined using a least squares linear regression analysis of the sodium nitrite standard curve. Mice immunization and sample collection All 16 female mice were randomly divided into two groups (8 mice/group) and immunized intramuscularly in their hind legs on day 0. Animals were treated with 50 \u00b5l per hind leg of PBS (PBS group) or with RIP (1 mg/ml; RIP group). On day 14, all mice were injected a second time. The body weight of experimental animals was measured every day until the end of the experiment. The animals were euthanized when the defined humane endpoint requirements were met: >15% loss of body weight within 1-2 days or >20% loss of body weight overall ( [32](#b32-ETM-22-6-10841)). On day 28, mice were humanely euthanized via intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) followed by cervical dislocation ( [33](#b33-ETM-22-6-10841)). Animal death was confirmed by the cessation of heartbeat and respiration. The spleens of mice were collected under sterile conditions. A single-cell suspension of splenocytes was prepared in 5% CO2 under saturated humidity. ELISA for the quantitative analysis of cytokines RAW264.7 cells (2x105 cells/well) were seeded into a 96-well plate and cultured for 24 h at 37C and 5% CO2 under saturated humidity. Cells were subsequently incubated at 37C with different concentrations of RIP (0.08, 0.32, 1.25 and 5 mg/ml) or LPS (2 \u00b5g/ml) in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. TNF- and IL-6 levels were determined by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Splenocytes (2x106 cells/well) were seeded into a 96-well and inactivated HSV-2 control) incubated at 37C for 48 h. IFN- and IL-10 levels of culture supernatant were then determined by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer. Western blotting RAW264.7 cells (3x106 cells/well) were seeded into a six-well plate and cultured in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h at 37C 5% CO2 under saturated humidity, then incubated at 37C with different concentrations of RIP (0.08, 0.32, 1.25 and 5 mg/ml) or LPS (2 \u00b5g/ml) in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. RAW264.7 cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS and lysed with Mammalian Cell Total Protein Lysis Buffer (cat. no. CW0889M; CoWin Biosciences). Total protein was quantified using Pierce Coomassie (Bradford) Protein Assay kit using BSA as a standard. Proteins (4.5 \u00b5g/sample) were separated by 10-12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) at 37C for 1 h. The membranes were incubated with the following primary monoclonal antibodies After washing the membrane with TBST for a total of three times, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000) secondary no. D110087; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) at 37C for 2 h. After washing the membrane with TBST for a total of five times, the membranes were treated with the W (western blot)-TMB Chromogenic Reagent kit (cat. no. C510025; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) at 37C for 15 min. Protein bands were visualized and imaged by western blotting imaging system (Peiqing Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). ImageJ software v1.8.0 (National Institutes of Health) was used to analyze the relative protein expression levels of TLR-4 (97 kDa), with -actin (42 kDa) as the loading control. Statistical analysis All in vitro experiments were performed in triplicate. A total of 8 mice per group were used for in vivo experiments. GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for data analysis. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. An unpaired Student's t-test was used make statistical comparisons between two groups, and one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's or Tukey's post hoc tests were used to make statistical comparisons between three or more groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Results RIP characterization The obtained RIPs were water soluble polysaccharides. We established in a previous study a glucose standard curve using the phenol-sulfuric acid method: The linear regression equation was y=0.0069x + 0.0397 [with x the mass of glucose (\u00b5g) and y the OD value at 450 nm]; R2=0.9955( [27](#b27-ETM-22-6-10841)). The carbohydrate content of RIP was 87.5% (100 mg crude polysaccharides contained 87.5 mg glucose). Using the Bradford protein assay, absorbance at 595 nm was 0.009, which was not within the BSA standard curve (25-2,000 \u00b5g/ml) and the protein content of RIP was lower than the detection sensitivity. The protein content was therefore considered to be weak. RIP cytotoxicity RIP cytotoxicity on RAW264.7 cells was examined ( [Fig. 1](#f1-ETM-22-6-10841)). RAW264.7 cell viability was almost 100% when RIP concentration was 1.25 mg/ml, demonstrating that RIPs had no cytotoxicity. Increasing the RIP concentration up to 10 mg/ml decreased cell viability; however, cell viability remained >95%, further demonstrating that RIP had a low cytotoxicity. The water-soluble RIPs extracted from R. isatidis, like other plant polysaccharides, had a low cytotoxicity ( [14](#b14-ETM-22-6-10841)). Therefore, 0.08, 0.32, 1.25 and 5 mg/ml of RIP were chosen for subsequent studies. | | Figure 1 Cytotoxicity of RIP in RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were treated with different concentrations of RIP from 0.02 to 10 mg/ml for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter 96\u00aeAQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay. High-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS served as negative control. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD (n=3). RIP, Radix isatidis polysaccharide. Morphological changes of RAW264.7 cells Following the addition of LPS and different concentrations of RIP to RAW264.7 cells, morphological changes were observed. In the control group, the RAW264.7 cells were round and clumped together ( [Fig. 2A](#f2-ETM-22-6-10841)). The RAW264.7 cells treated with different concentrations of RIP all displayed morphological changes in a dose-dependent manner. In the 0.08 mg/ml RIP-treated group, the cellular morphology was almost the same as the control group and cells were clustered together, only a few cells has a spindle-like shape ( [Fig. 2B](#f2-ETM-22-6-10841)). In the 0.32 mg/ml RIP-treated group, approximately one fourth of the cells were spindle-like but the round cells still clustered together ( [Fig. 2C](#f2-ETM-22-6-10841)). In the 1.25 mg/ml RIP group, almost half of the cells were spindle-like and independent, not aggregating in groups ( [Fig. 2D](#f2-ETM-22-6-10841)). In the 5 mg/ml RIP-treated group, most of the cells were spindle-like or polygonal in shape and were more dispersed ( [Fig. 2E](#f2-ETM-22-6-10841)). The morphological changes seen in the 5 mg/ml RIP treated group were the same as the LPS-treated group ( [Fig. 2F](#f2-ETM-22-6-10841)). | | Figure 2 RIP-induces morphological changes in RAW264.7 cells. Cells were treated with RIP (0.08, 0.32, 1.25 and 5 mg/ml), LPS (2 \u00b5g/ml) or high-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS alone for 24 h. Morphological changes were observed using a phase-contrast microscope. The images are as follows: (A) control, (B) 0.08 mg/ml RIP, (C) 0.32 mg/ml RIP, (D) 1.25 mg/ml RIP, (E) 5 mg/ml RIP and (F) LPS. The experiment had three independent repeats. RIP, Radix isatidis polysaccharide; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. NO production RIP (0.08, 0.32, 1.25 and 5 mg/ml) stimulated RAW264.7 cells to produce NO as demonstrated in [Table I](#tI-ETM-22-6-10841). A RIP concentration of 1.25 mg/ml produced the highest significant concentration of NO (17.38\u00b10.50 \u00b5M) in RAW264.7 cells compared with the medium control and all other RIP concentrations (P<0.01).

RAW 264.7 cells were treated with RIP (0.08, 0.32, 1.25 and 5 mg/ml), LPS (2 \u00b5g/ml) or DMEM only for 24 h. The culture supernatants of RAW264.7 cells were collected for detection of (A) TNF- and (B) IL-6 by ELISA. All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD (n=3).

Discussion Immunomodulation is regarded as a vital treatment strategy for enhancing the body's immune defense in patients with cancer and in those that are immunocompromised. Macrophages are the first line of defense against infections and are positioned throughout the tissues of the body ( [34](#b34-ETM-22-6-10841)). The immunomodulatory functions of macrophages include macrophage proliferation, phagocytic activity, the release of cytotoxic and inflammatory molecules such as NO and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6 present study, RIP induced morphological changes in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The emergence of the dendritic-like morphology of macrophages may reflect their activation ( [39](#b39-ETM-22-6-10841)). During this possible activation, the activated RAW264.7 cells produced NO, TNF- and IL-6. However, when the RIP concentration was 5 mg/ml, the production of NO decreased: It may be associated with the high concentration of RIP. Previous studies have demonstrated that RIP has adjuvant properties, elicited by the combined secretion of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines ( [19](#b19-ETM-22-6-10841), [27](#b27-ETM-22-6-10841)). In the present study, it was also demonstrated that RIP-injected mice had splenocytes with enhanced immune function when injected with inactive HSV-2 as a foreign stimulus. Following splenocyte stimulation by inactivated HSV-2, levels of IFN- and IL-10 were significantly increased compared with PBS-treated mice. krnjug et al ( [40](#b40-ETM-22-6-10841)) and Ning et al ( [41](#b41-ETM-22-6-10841)) also demonstrated this using a similar approach. IFN- is produced by Th1 cells and promotes the expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules through activation of macrophages. IFN- also enhances natural killer cell activity and regulates B cell function ( [42](#b42-ETM-22-6-10841)). IL-10 has stimulatory effects on B cells, including the promotion of B cell survival ( [43](#b43-ETM-22-6-10841), [44](#b44-ETM-22-6-10841)) and the stimulation of B cell proliferation and differentiation ( [45-47](#b45-ETM-22-6-10841%20b46-ETM-22-6-10841%20b47-ETM-22-6-10841)). There is evidence that a mixed Th1/Th2 response, characterized by IL-10 production, may enhance pathogen clearance ( [48](#b48-ETM-22-6-10841), [49](#b49-ETM-22-6-10841)). In the present study, mice were injected with a single dose of RIP. Further studies should consider the RIP dose gradient used in the current study for murine immunization. The immune function of RIP-immunized mice may possibly have been enhanced. The results may provide the foundations for the further development of an immunomodulator. LPS is a major macrophage activation factor and is widely used as an in vitro inflammatory model ( [50](#b50-ETM-22-6-10841)). On the membrane of RAW264.7 cells, LPS binds to CD14 receptors and further recognizes TLR-4( [51](#b51-ETM-22-6-10841)). TLR-4 requires myeloid differentiation factor 2 to form a complex for effective LPS recognition and downstream activation of the NF-B signaling pathway ( [51](#b51-ETM-22-6-10841)). The present study demonstrated the mechanisms of RIP-mediated activation and an increase in the relative expression level of TLR-4 in RIP-treated RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. As this is only preliminary research, more molecules within this signaling pathway should be investigated in the context of this study. The complexity of polysaccharide composition, including chemical composition, molecular weight, glycosidic linkage and the degree of branching, influences the application of polysaccharides ( [52](#b52-ETM-22-6-10841)). Previous studies of polysaccharides have focused on their extraction and purification. Two purified polysaccharides, an -glucan and an arabinogalactan isolated from R. isatidis, both have immunoadjuvant potential ( [25](#b25-ETM-22-6-10841), [26](#b26-ETM-22-6-10841)). Based on these studies, future work will focus on purified polysaccharides, such as the comparison of the immunostimulatory effects between purified polysaccharides and mixed polysaccharides. In conclusion, the immunomodulatory effects of RIP included the activation of RAW264.7 cells and the possible improvement of splenocyte immune function. The present study determined that RIP could potentially be used as a novel immunomodulator. Acknowledgements Not applicable.
