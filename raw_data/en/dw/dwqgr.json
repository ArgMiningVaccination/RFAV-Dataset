The systematic use of herbal therapy has developed over thousands of years with an increased popularity over recent years. With the negative side effects of many mainstream pharmaceuticals, the treatment offered by a herbalist is seen as a much more valuable alternative - effective in treating a range of illnesses while being non-habit forming. Natural herbal medicine has played an important role in conventional Western medicine, providing biological compounds initially found in plants that were synthesized to make up pharmaceutical drugs. With the chemical additives of pharmaceutical companies, these biological compounds are safer and more effective when taken in their herbal form, easily ingested as teas, tablets, essential oils or extracts, with Western Fluid Extracts a prime example - sourced from nature and provided in tablet or liquid form. As with all our therapies, personally tailored medicines are matched to individual needs. Herbal supplements work by engaging the body to enhance or inhibit organ function, with the aim of correcting physiological imbalance and resolving established patterns of dysfunction. Whole plants are generally used as they contain the most wide reaching benefits through synergistic action, while reducing overall toxicity at the same time. Our extensive knowledge of herbal medicine allows us to make prescriptions to suit each individual, on a case by case basis. China Med, Black Pearl patented Chinese pills - We are proud to carry China Med herbal products with over 140 classic formulas, mostly in the form of concentrated pills or capsules. Also available in an extensive range of granulated single herbs. The possibility of unwanted side effects has been filtered out over a long period of clinical experience. Homeopathy is a system of medicine which involves treating the individual with highly diluted substances, given mainly in tablet or liquid form, with the aim of triggering the body's natural system of healing. Based on specific symptoms, a homeopath will match the most appropriate medicine to each patient. Homotoxicology integrates the treatment principles of homeopathy with the diagnostic approach of allopathic medicine. The goal of homotoxicology is to detoxify the body and restore the body's natural biorhythms, thereby stimulating the body's ability to heal itself.
