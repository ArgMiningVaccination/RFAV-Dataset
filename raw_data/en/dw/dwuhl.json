CVD-Mali's core work since its inception has revolved around quantifying the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, and testing the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of new vaccines. CVD-Mali also plays an important role in the training of young investigators in Mali and around the world. CVD-Mali shares its research results with the Ministry of Health to guide public health decisions. CVD-Mali focuses on research and interventions which develop primary health care, to pave the way towards Universal Health Coverage. CVD-Mali's core principles are based around strong technical capacity in epidemiologic surveillance, laboratory capability, field surveys and clinical trials. "}
