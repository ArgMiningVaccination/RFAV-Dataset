LOUIS BLUES, ENTEPRISE CENTER AND STIFEL THEATRE TO END REQUIREMENT OF PROOF OF VACCINATION OR NEGATIVE TEST FOR GUESTS ATTENDING GAMES AND EVENTS ENTERPRISE CENTER POLICY TO BE DISCONTINUED BEGINNING MARCH 6 FOR MVC MEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT CHAMIPIONSHIP; STIFEL THEATRE POLICY TO BE DISCONTINUED BEGINNING MARCH 7 ST. LOUIS, March 4, 2022 - The St. Louis Blues today announced that beginning Sunday, fans attending home games will no longer be required to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a recent negative COVID-19 test result for entry into Enterprise Center. The policy is being discontinued in recognition of the significant reduction in local COVID-19 cases while being in alignment with the City of St. Louis' recent announcement that its indoor mask mandate will expire at 11:59 p.m. on Saturday. Fans attending the Missouri Valley Conference men's basketball tournament championship game at Enterprise Center on Sunday will therefore neither be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative test result to enter, nor obligated to wear a mask while inside the venue. Discontinuation of the policies at Stifel Theatre will go into effect on Monday, March 7. Some concerts, shows or other events at Stifel Theatre, as well as Enterprise Center, may be subject to vaccination or mask protocols at the request of the artist. As an example, proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test will be required this Sunday afternoon at Stifel Theatre for the performance of Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood Live! The vaccination or negative test requirement policy was introduced in October, ahead of the Blues' first regular season home game, and had applied to all guests, event staff, sponsors, news media and all who entered Enterprise Center and Stifel Theatre. The Blues will continue to be guided in the months ahead by the CDC as well as local, state and federal health and safety authorities. \"Returning to full capacity in October required a commitment by everyone, including our fans and guests, to the well-being of everyone who entered Enterprise Center and Stifel Theatre,\" said Chris Zimmerman, President and CEO of Business Operations of the St. Louis Blues, Enterprise Center and Stifel Theatre. \"It's because of that commitment, here and throughout our community, that we're able to make this announcement today. \"We are extremely grateful for everyone's support and compliance over the past five months. There is always the potential of having to revisit the vaccination or negative test policy, but we certainly hope that won't be the case. In that spirit, we ask that all of our guests continue to do all they can to respect the health and safety of their fellow fans, as well as our employees who are there to serve them. The more we do for one another, the better all of us will be.\" More information is available for fans and guests "}
