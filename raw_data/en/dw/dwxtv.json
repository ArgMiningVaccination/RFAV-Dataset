When researching Stockley 's Drug Inter- actions we had noticed the growing wealth of experimental data on herbal medicines, which does not fall within the brief of Stockley, which is primarily a clinically based reference work. However, it seemed somewhat of an omission tooverlook what is obviously valuable information in what can almost be considered a new field of drug interactions. We therefore reached the point where we decided that it wasworth producing a book dedicated to this information;however, little did we realise what a journey we 'd be taking ourselves on. As a group dedicated to the study of drug interactions, and the provision of clinically relevant data (aided by the largenumber of practising pharmacists we have on our team), we felt well equipped to deal with the interactions data. The herbal medicines side of things was, however, not somethingthat we were particularly familiar with, and we were greatly relieved to be approached by Elizabeth Williamson, with a very similar idea to our own, but with a wealth of knowledgeon herbal medicines with which to guide us. Liz is widelypublished in the field of herbal medicines, and is a member of a number of bodies that consider many aspects of herbal medicine use, such as the British Pharmacopoeia Commis-sion. Liz is the Chair of the Expert Advisory Group forHerbal and Complementary Medicines, which advises the BPC on standards for herbal drugs for the pharmaceutical industry. As a team therefore, we feel we have unrivalledexperience in assessing herb -drug interactions, and we believe that ours is a unique collaboration. Herbal medicines are, more than ever, receiving attention, both from the public and healthcare professionals alike, withmany countries now undertaking registration schemes for traditional medicines. However, healthcare professionals still freely admit their lack of knowledge in this area, and surveyssuggest that patients often rely on friends and family foradvice about herbal medicines. Never has there been a more appropriate time to advise healthcare professionals so that they can provide balanced, helpful advice to patients wishingto take herbal medicines with their 'conventional 'treatments. Our aim, as ever, has therefore been to critically evaluate the published literature and present it in a familiar, easy-to- handle format, so that the busy healthcare professional canquickly access the information and apply it to their clinical situation.This publication attempts to answer the same questions that we address in Stockley' s Drug Interactions , namely: .Are the drugs and substances in question known to interact or is the interaction only theoretical andspeculative? .If they do interact, how serious is it? .Has it been described many times or only once? .Are all patients affected or only a few? .Is it best to avoid these two substances altogether or can the interaction be accommodated in some way? .And what alternative and safer drugs can be used instead? Stockley 's Herbal Medicines Interactions follows the same easy-to-read format as our other publications, with the textorganised into a series of individual monographs, all with acommon format. In addition, we have included sections on: nomenclature, to help users identify herbal medicines that they or their patients may be familiar with under a differentname; uses, so that those less familiar with herbal medicines can put their use into context; and constituents, to allow us to address interactions that occur as a result of asubstance common to several plants. A pharmacopoeiasection is also included for those herbal medicines, dietary supplements and nutraceuticals that have entries in the latest editions (at time of press) of the British Pharmaco- poeia, the European Pharmacopoeia and the United States Pharmacopoeia . An indication of the constituents that the herbal medicine may be standardised for is also provided where necessary, but note that this does not necessarily mean that all marketed products are standardised in this way. In addition, we have added the simple, intuitive ratings system that users of Stockley 's Interaction Alerts and Stockley' s Drug Interactions Pocket Companion will already be familiar with. As with all Stockley products, the text is written for a worldwide audience. Terminology has been carefully con- sidered and international terms have been added where it was thought helpful to do so. This and the inclusion of the synonyms and pharmacopoeia sections will, we hope, cater for the needs of healthcare professionals around the world. As always, the Editorial team have had assistance from many other people in developing this publication, and the Editors gratefully acknowledge the assistance and guidance that they have provided. Of particular note are: the DigitalProducts Team led by Jane Macintyre; Ithar Malik, Ruchi Birla, Karl Parsons, Tom Whitaker and Darren Searson, who vihave worked tirelessly in transforming our data into a useable output. Particular thanks are also due to the editor of Martindale , Sean Sweetman, who has acted as our mentor on a number of other projects, and continues to provide invaluable support. Thanks are also due to Tamsin Cousins, who has handled the various aspects of producing this publication in print. We are also grateful for the support ofboth Paul Weller and Charles Fry. Ivan Stockley remains animportant part of all products bearing his name, and we are most grateful for the feedback that he provided on this new project.

Before using this publication it is advisable to read this short explanatory section so that you know how the druginteraction data have been set out here, and why, as well asthe basic philosophy that has been followed in presenting it. The monographs This publication includes over 150 herbal medicines,nutraceuticals or dietary supplements. For each of these products there is an introductory section, which includes the following sections where appropriate: .Synonyms and related species or Types, sources and related compounds .Pharmacopoeias .Constituents .Uses and indications .Pharmacokinetics .Interactions overview. The synonyms, constituents and uses have largely been compiled with reference to a number of standard sources.These include: .Sweetman SC . [online] London: Pharmaceutical Press http://www.medicinescomplete.com/ .Williamson EM, ed. Potter Herbal Cyclopaedia. Saffron Walden: The C.W. Daniel Company Limited; 2003. .Barnes J, Anderson LA, Phillipson JD (eds), Herbal Medicines 3. [online] London: Pharmaceutical Press http://www.medicinescomplete.com/ .Williamson EM, ed. Major Herbs of Ayurveda. 1st ed. London: Elsevier; 2002. More than 550 interactions monographs are included, each with a common format. These are subdivided into the following sections: .Abstract or summary for quick reading..Clinical evidence, detailing the interaction and citing the clinical evidence currently available. .Experimental evidence. Due to the nature of interactions with herbal medicines much of the data currently available comes from animal andin vitro studies. Although this data doesn 't always extrapolate to the clinical situation it can be used to provide some idea of the likelihood and potential severity of an interaction. It has been deliberately kept separate from the clinical data, because this type ofdata is a better guide to predicting outcomes in practice. .Mechanism, to allow an understanding as to why theinteraction may occur. .Importance and management. As with all Stockley products, providing guidance on how to manage an interaction is our key aim. The short discussion isdesigned to aid rapid clinical decision-making. .References, a list of all of the relevant references. Some of the monographs have been compressed into fewersubsections instead of the more usual five, simply whereinformation is limited or where there is little need to be moreexpansive. The monographs also carry an adapted form of the drug interaction Hazard/Severity ratings as used in the electronicStockley Interactions Alerts andStockley 's Drug Interactions Pocket Companion. Where difficulties arise in applying ratings to monographs that cover multiple pairs of drug -herb interactions, we have chosen to illustrate the worst-case scenario. Reading the Importance and management section will explain which members of the groups are most likely to represent a problem. The interactions are rated using three separate categories: .Action: this describes whether or not any action needs to be taken to accommodate the interaction. This category ranges from 'avoid' to 'no action needed '. .Severity: this describes the likely effect of an unmanaged interaction on the patient. This category ranges from 'severe 'to 'nothing expected '. .Evidence: this describes the weight of evidence behind the interaction. This category ranges from 'extensive 'to 'theoretical, weak '. These ratings are combined to produce one of five symbols: For interactions that have a life-threatening outcome, or where concurrent use is considered to be best avoided. For interactions where concurrent use may result in a significant hazard to the patient and so dosage adjustment or close monitoring is needed. 1For interactions where there is a potentially hazardous outcome, but where, perhaps, the data is poor and conclu- sions about the interaction are difficult to draw. For interactions where there is doubt about the outcome of concurrent use, and therefore it may be necessary to givepatients some guidance about possible adverse effects, and/or consider some monitoring. For interactions that are not considered to be of clinical significance, or where no interaction occurs. We put a lot of thought in to the original design of these symbols, and have deliberately avoided a numerical orcolour-coding system as we did not want to imply any relationship between the symbols and colours. Instead we chose internationally recognisable symbols, which in testingwere intuitively understood by our target audience ofhealthcare professionals. There are also several 'family monographs' included. These are for constituents that have been demonstrated tointeract in their own right, but which are prevalent in anumber of herbal medicines, the most common example of this being the flavonoids. This structure allows us to assess the relevant data in one place, and cross-reference the readeras appropriate. Because so many herbs contain a multitude of these constituents it would not be possible to cover them in each plant monograph. Data selection This publication has been produced by the team that writesStockley 's Drug Interactions , with the help and guidance of an expert in the herbal medicines field. The same rigorousapproach that is used to produce Stockley 's Drug Inter- actions has been applied here, although with some notable differences, particularly in the selection of data for inclusion.The data on interactions are of widely varying quality andreliability, and this is even more the case when considering interactions between herbal medicines and conventional drugs. The best information comes from clinical studiescarried out on large numbers of patients under scrupulously controlled conditions; however, with herbal medicines these are sparse. Indeed those that there are have already beenincluded in Stockley' s Drug Interactions . What this publica- tion attempts to do is assess the wealth of data from animal andin vitro studies, which would not normally be considered for inclusion in Stockley 's Drug Interactions . As with all our publications we undertake extensive literature searching, we consider guidance published by regulatory bodies and we aim to avoid citing secondary literature wherever possible. Some of the studies cited inherb -drug interaction articles or publications are of doubtful quality and some are merely speculation. We have included them because they appear in other reference sources for interactions, but we have attempted to put their results andrecommendations in perspective. The herbal medicines, dietary supplements and nutraceu- ticals selected for inclusion in this first edition were chosenon the basis of their popularity and/or because they haveinteraction reports associated them. Nomenclature Every care has been taken to correctly identify the herbalmedicine involved in interactions. The botanical nomenclat-ure and the vast number of colloquial names used for theplants can be very confusing. We have therefore adopted one name for each herbal medicine that is used consistently throughout the monograph, and indeed across the publica-tion. However, we are aware that we will not always have selected the most appropriate name for some countries and have therefore included a synonyms field to aid users whoknow the plant by different names. The synonyms comefrom several well-respected sources and, where botanical names are used, have been cross-checked against the extremely useful database constructed by Kew (RoyalBotanic Gardens, Kew (2002). electronic Plant InformationCentre. Available at http://epic.kew.org/epic/). Occasionally the same synonym has been used for more than one herbal medicine and, where we are aware of this, we have beencareful to highlight the potential for confusion. We should also point out that we have chosen the phrase 'conventional medicines 'to distinguish those products that are licensed and commonly used in Western medicine. Thisnomenclature is not meant to imply any preference, it is just simply a way of being clear about which preparation we are discussing. Similarly, there is the potential for confusion between the synthetic coumarins used as anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, acenocoumarol) and those coumarins that occur naturally within plants. We have therefore chosen to use the term'coumarins 'for those of synthetic origin, and 'natural coumarins 'to distinguish those of plant origin. Incidence of herbal medicines interactions The incidence of interactions between herbal medicines andnutritional supplements with conventional drugs is not yet fully known, and there is no body of reliable information currently available to draw upon when assessing the scale ofany possible problem, or predicting clinical outcomes. Evenin the case of St John' s wort, which is now commonly known to interact with a number of drugs, the clinicalsignificance of some reported cases cannot be accuratelyevaluated due to the variation in the nature of the herb itselfand products made from it. In general, the lack of evidence may be due to under-reporting or unrecognised interactions, but there is also the possibility that many herbal medicineshave a generally safe profile and do not interact significantlywith drugs. Given the poor quality of information available it can be difficult to put the problem into perspective and in the absence of good evidence, speculation has taken its place.Ivan Stockley, a pioneer in the field of drug-interaction investigation, has often maintained that data on interactions are of widely varying quality and reliability, and stated that'sometimes they are no more than speculative and theoreticalscaremongering guesswork, hallowed by repeated quotation until they become virtually set in stone '. Although these remarks were made in the context of drug interactions, they are even more apposite when applied to herb-drug inter- actions where anecdotal reports, uncontrolled studies or data based solely on animal studies are the main form of evidence available. These have to be evaluated very carefully before advising patients as to the safety (or not) of combining herbal medicines with either other supplements or conven- tional drugs. While many publications uncritically usetheoretical evidence to advise on this issue, it risks thedanger that patients (and their friends and families) who have2 General considerationsalready taken supplements and drugs together with no problems will no longer believe even good advice -and subsequently take incompatible combinations to ill effect. Itis also noticeable that, whilst anecdotal or theoreticalevidence is quite rightly considered unacceptable as evi- dence of efficacy for herbal products, it seems to be given undue credibility when demonstrating toxicity, and con-sumers of natural medicines have observed this doublestandard. Obviously the best answer to this problem is for good and reliable evidence to become available, and for the importance of reports to be based on the nature of theevidence that they provide. In the first instance, it would bemost useful to know the extent of the problem and the risk or likelihood of a herb-drug interaction arising. However, even numbers of people taking supplements is not accuratelyknown, although over the past 10 years several studies have been carried out to try to assess this. Some knowledge of not only who, but how and why people are taking herbalmedicines can help to identify potential problems or warn ofthem before they arise. Who uses herbal medicines? The use of herbal medicines and nutritional supplements isincreasing dramatically in many parts of the world, espe-cially in Europe, the US and Australasia, as part of the popularity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). It is difficult to measure the extent of the use ofherbal products by consumers and patients in a largelyunregulated market, especially with so many herbal products being sold over the internet, and survey studies that have attempted to do so have often been criticised for flawedmethodology. However, there is no doubt that the issue of people taking herbal and nutritional products at the same time as conventional medicines is significant, and thepurpose of this publication is to provide information sothat this practice can be carried out as safely as possible. Some idea of the size of the market and its recent growth can be seen from a series of studies carried out over the pastfew years in the US. In 1997, the results of a national survey 1 indicated that approximately 12% of the adult responders had taken a herbal remedy in the past year, which was an increase of 380% from 1990, and almost 1 in 5 of thosetaking prescription drugs were also taking a herbal orvitamin supplement. In 1998 and 1999, a survey of over 2500 adults estimated that 14% of the general population were regularly taking herbal products and, of patients takingprescription drugs, 16% also took a herbal supplement. 2Data obtained from a separate 1999 survey estimated that 9.6% ofUS adults used herbal medicines, 3which was lower than would be expected from the previous study, and illustratesthe problems of assessing consumer behaviour accurately, but it is still a significant increase from the 1990 figures. By 2002, figures showed that the annual use of dietarysupplements had risen to 18.8%. 4Although the accuracy of these figures can be questioned, what is also noteworthy is that the studies were carried out in the general population, so it is logical to assume that in the patient population usagecould be even higher. A survey undertaken in the UK in 1994 suggests that the prevalence of alternative medicine use (which includedherbal medicines) was 8.5% of the population, whereas inGermany, in 1996, it was much higher, at 65%. The lowfigure for the UK could be because of national differences,because different types of use were assessed (1-year versus lifetime) or because, at the time, the UK was undergoing a difficult economic period and usually CAM is paid forprivately. 5Useful information about herbal medicinal use can also be obtained from the monetary value of the market.In 2002, French health insurance paid $91 million in partialreimbursements for ginkgo, saw palmetto and pygeumprescriptions, with a total value of $196 million, and, in 2003, German health insurance paid $283 million in reim- bursements for prescribed herbal products including ginkgo,St John 's wort, saw palmetto, hawthorn, stinging nettle root and pumpkin seed. These figures do not include non- prescription purchase of herbal remedies, but it is known that, in 2003, European countries spent almost $5 billion (atmanufacturers 'prices) on non-prescription herbal medi- cines, 6and of course the cost at consumer level would be very much higher. 1.

Herbal medicine use in specific patient groups (a) Cancer patients Certain groups of patients are known, or thought to have, a higher incidence of supplement usage than others. It is generally thought that cancer patients, for example, have an exceptionally high intake of herbal and nutritional supple-ments. One of the first studies to collate the informationavailable on CAM use in cancer patients was from 1998, when a systematic review of 26 surveys from 13 countries was published. CAM use in adults ranged from 7 to 64%,with an average use of 31.4%. 1The high degree of variability was thought to be most likely due to different understandings of the term CAM on the part of both investigators and patients, but also illustrates that the resultsof such surveys must be interpreted very carefully. A subsequent study showed that CAM use (both self-medica- tion and visits to CAM practitioners) had increased signifi-cantly from 1998 to 2005 in cancer patients, and it wasestimated that more than 80% of all women with breast cancer use CAM, 41% in a specific attempt to manage their breast cancer. The most commonly used herbal products forthis purpose in 2005 were flaxseed, green tea and vitamins(C and E). 2A US survey of outpatients with cancer found that 83.3% had used at least one CAM. Vitamins and herbalmedicines were used by 62.6% of patients, and use wasgreater in women and those of a younger age. 3These findings were reflected in a 2005 study which confirmedthat, of the chemotherapy patients surveyed, 91% reportedusing at least one form of CAM (most frequently diets,massage and herbal medicine). Of these patients only 57%General considerations 3discussed the use of at least one of these therapies with their healthcare provider.4 Herbal medicine use by cancer patients seems to be high in many parts of the world: in New Zealand 49% of cancerpatients at a regional centre used CAM (most commonly vitamins, antioxidants, alternative diets and herbal medicines) to improve the quality of life and in the hope of a cure (47%and 30% of CAM users, respectively). CAM was deemedhelpful in the management of their cancer by 71% of patients, and 89% felt that CAM was safe. Younger patients tended to use CAM more. 5The different patterns of herbal use between cancer patients undergoing palliative or curative chemother-apy has also been studied, and the results confirmed that both groups frequently use herbal remedies concurrently with chemotherapy (37% and 38%, respectively), but with aslightly different intent. Palliative patients tended to show more frequent herbal use than curative patients (78% versus 67%), whereas curative patients used herbal remedies muchmore often to relieve adverse effects (31% versus 3%). 6 (b) Patients on weight-loss programmes Other groups of patients known to use supplements regularly are those on weight-loss programmes and most of the weight-loss supplements taken (73.8%) contained stimulantssuch as ephedra, caffeine and/or bitter orange. An estimated 15.2% of American adults (women 20.6%, men 9.7%) had used a weight-loss supplement at some time: 8.7% within thepast year (women 11.3%, men 6%). Women aged 18 to34 years used weight-loss supplements the most (16.7%), and use was equally prevalent among ethnic groups and education levels. More worryingly, many adults were long-term users and most did not discuss this practice with theirdoctor. 7 (c) Hospital inpatients A study of herbal medicine use during perioperative careidentified the most commonly used medications andassessed their potential for causing adverse events or drug interactions in patients who were having surgical procedures. Their conclusions were that certain herbal medicines posed apotential danger in perioperative care (such as St John' s wort because of its enzyme-inducing effects and valerian because of its sedative effects), but no attempt was made to ascertain the incidence of such events. 8However, in 2007, a study of 299 patients on the medical wards of two hospitals in Israelfound that 26.8% of participants took herbal medicines or dietary supplements and, of these, potential interactions were noted in 7.1%. The authors suggested that most patients arenot asked specifically about herbal consumption by their medical team. 9 1. Ernst E, Cassileth BR.

Differences in herbal use in specific population groups (a) The elderly CAM use is high in those of 65 years of age and over (27.7% according to one US study), but declines among those aged 75 years and over and, overall, more women than men areCAM users. The highest level of use seems to be amongAsians (48.6%), followed by Hispanics (31.6%), whites (27.7%) and blacks (20.5%). 1Data drawn from a 2002 survey that included a supplement on the use of herbal medicines, with the analysis limited to adults aged 65 years and older, showed that herbs were an important component of their own health management. Whereas about 25% of theAsian and Hispanic elderly used herbal medicines, onlyabout 10% of the black and white elderly used them; the herbs used, and the reasons for doing so, also differed according to ethnicity. 2 It is also apparent that, in the elderly, the use of herbal medicines with conventional medicines, both prescription and non-prescription, is widespread. The risk for adverse interactions was assessed in a Medicare population, using aretrospective analysis of Cardiovascular Health Study inter- view data from four different years. Of 5052 participants, the median age at the beginning of the study was 75 years,60.2% were female, 16.6% were African -American and 83.4% were white. From 1994 to 1999 the number using herbal medicines increased from 6.3% to 15.1%, and the number using herbal medicines concurrently with conven-tional drugs also increased, from 6% to 14.4%. Combin-ations thought to be potentially risky were noted in 393 separate interviews, with most (379 reports in 281 patients) involving a risk of bleeding due to use of garlic, ginkgo orginseng together with aspirin, warfarin, ticlopidine orpentoxifylline. An additional 786 drug-herb combinations were considered to have some (again) theoretical or uncer- tain risk for an adverse interaction. 3 The type of products taken obviously reflect the age group taking them, and the most common products used by theelderly are those concerned with ameliorating degenerativeor age-related conditions. In a predominantly white (91%)elderly cohort, the use of dietary supplements was surveyed each year from 1994 to 1999 for an average of 359 male (36%) and female (64%) participants aged 60 to 99 years. By1999, glucosamine emerged as the most frequently used(non-vitamin, non-mineral) supplement followed by ginkgo, chondroitin and garlic. For women, there was a significant trend of increasing use for black cohosh, starflower oil,evening primrose glucosamine, grapeseed extract, hawthorn and St John' s wort. For men, alpha-lipoic acid, ginkgo and grapeseed extract showed asimilar trend. 44 General considerations(b) Children Surprisingly, herbal medicine and nutritional supplement use in children can also be high, and so is the concurrent use with conventional medicine. A convenience sampling of paediatric emergency department patients in the US wascarried out during a 3-month period in 2001, where 153families participated in the study, with a mean patient age of 5.3 years. Children were given a herbal medicine by 45% of caregivers, and the most common herbal medicines report-edly used were aloe plant or juice (44%), echinacea (33%)and sweet oil (25%). 5 More recently, 1804 families were interviewed in a study of parents and patients up to 18 years arriving at a largepaediatric emergency department in Toronto, Canada. Con- ventional and herbal medicines or supplements were being used concurrently in 20% of the patients and 15% werereceiving more than one herbal medicine simultaneously.The authors of this study identified possible herb -drug or herb -herb interactions in 16% of children. 6 (c) Gender Studies usually show that herbal medicine use is higher inwomen than men, and this is likely to be true for manyreasons, despite the unreliability of figures gained in surveys. Women generally live longer than men, and elderly people take more supplements; women tend to be the primary carersfor children and the elderly and also purchase most of theeveryday remedies used in the home; and women take more weight-loss products than men. In several studies, it is suggested that women are at least twice as likely to takeherbal medicines or supplements as men. 1,7-10 (d) Educational level and knowledge of herbal products People of all levels of educational attainment are likely to take herbal and nutritional supplements. Some studies suggest that usage is similar across most education levels,10 whereas others have found that college graduates appear tohave the highest incidence of herbal use. 4,7,11 Despite the generally high levels of education, it is of great concern thatconsumers do not have a correspondingly high level ofknowledge about the products that they are consuming. In astudy of caregivers who reported giving their child a herbal product, 88% had at least 1 year of college education. However, 77% of the participants in the study did notbelieve, or were uncertain, if herbal medicines had any adverse effects; only 27% could name a potential adverse effect and 66% were unsure, or thought that herbalmedicines did not interact with other medications. 5In a study in Israel of users of 'natural drugs', 56.2% believed that they caused no adverse effects.12In Australia, the perceptions of emergency department patients towards CAMwere assessed by comparing the CAM users (68% of thepatients surveyed) with non-users, particularly regarding safety and efficacy. In both cases there was no significant difference between CAM users and non-users, with 44.1%agreeing that CAM is drug free and, more worryingly, 28.5% agreeing, or strongly agreeing, that CAM is always safe to take with prescription drugs. However, significantly moreCAM users agreed that CAM is safe and can prevent peoplefrom becoming ill and, furthermore, is more effective thanprescription drugs. Moreover, significantly fewer CAM usersagreed that prescription drugs are safe to take. 13 (e) Rural populations An Australian postal questionnaire survey found that inpeople living in rural areas of New South Wales the use ofCAM is high, with garlic and echinacea being the most usedherbal products. Of those responding, 70.3% reported using one or more CAM and 62.7% had visited a complementary practitioner. 14In Jamaica, concurrent surveys were carried out in Kingston (an urban parish) and Clarendon (a rural parish) in 743 patients who visited health centres and pharmacies. Herbal medicines were taken with conventionalmedicines by 80% of respondents and 87% of these did nottell their healthcare provider. In the rural community 92% took herbal medicines with conventional medicines, com- pared with 70% of the urban community. 15 1. Arcury TA, Suerken CK, Grzywacz JG, Bell RA, Lang W, Quandt SA.

Attitudes to the use of herbal medicines People who use herbal medicines and nutritional supple- ments report their primary source of information as friendsor relatives in 80% of cases, and only 45% of those giving their children herbal products report discussing it with either their doctor or pharmacist. 1In one study, 44.7% never reported herbal usage to their physician, and 11% did so onlyrarely. 2Again, this is a general trend found in other studies,3 sometimes with even higher levels (e.g. up to 70%) ofnon-reporting seen. 4In one study in New Zealand only 41% of patients had discussed their CAM use with their oncologist, and almost one-third had started such medicines before being seen at the cancer treatment centre.5In a study of hospital inpatients a great cause for concern was that 94%of the patients had not been asked specifically about herbalGeneral considerations 5consumption by the medical team and only 23% of the hospital 's medical files of the patients taking herbal medi- cines or dietary supplements had any record of this fact.6In fact, in many studies, even where the question was asked,many patients did not inform their doctor that they were also taking herbal remedies. 7,8 This serious under-reporting by patients may probably be because they consider herbal medicines safe, even if taken at the same time as prescription drugs.9One study found a significant correlation between the belief that herbal medi-cines can cause adverse effects and the tendency to reporttheir usage to the family physician. 2Some patients may fear the disapproval of the physician and, since they consider the medicines to be safe, see no reason for inviting problems by disclosing these practices. Unfortunately, even if patients doreport their use of herbal medicines to the physician or pharmacist, there is no guarantee that accurate information or advice will be available. Physicians usually underestimatethe extent to which their patients use these remedies andoften do not ask for information from the patient. Worse still, in one survey 51% of doctors believed that herbal medicines have no or only mild adverse effects and 75% admitted thatthey had little or no knowledge about what they are. 10 Pharmacists are equally likely to encounter patients taking supplements together with prescription or non-prescription medicines as they may be asked for advice, or theymay actually sell or supply the herbal medicine. Manypharmacists (like many doctors) do not feel that they have enough basic knowledge themselves, or information readily available, to recommend these safely, 11although, according to a study in an international cohort of pharmacists, 84% have tried CAM at some time in their life, and 81% still felt that they had inadequate skills and knowledgeto counsel patients. 12Personal use of dietary supplements was found to correlate with a twofold increase in the likelihood that a pharmacist would recommend them to a patient.11 1.

This definition is obviously as true for conventional medicines as it is for herbal medicines. The outcome can be harmful if the interaction causes an increase in the toxicity of the drug. A potential example of this is the experimental increase in toxicity seen when amikacin is given withginkgo, see Ginkgo + Aminoglycosides, page 209. A reduction in efficacy due to an interaction can sometimes be just as harmful as an increase. For example, the reductionin ciclosporin levels caused by St John' s wort has led to transplant rejection in some cases. See St John' s wort + Ciclosporin, page 368. As with any publication detailing the adverse effects of drug use it would be very easy to conclude after browsingthrough this publication that it is extremely risky to treat patients with conventional drugs and herbal medicines, but this would be an over-reaction. Patients can apparentlytolerate adverse interactions remarkably well, and manyinteractions can be accommodated for (for example, through natural dose titration), so that the effects may not con- sciously be recognised as the result of an interaction. One of the reasons that it is often difficult to detect an interaction is that, as already mentioned, patient variability isconsiderable. We now know many of the predisposing andprotective factors that determine whether or not an inter-action occurs but in practice it is still very difficult to predict what will happen when an individual patient is given two potentially interacting medicines. This effect is compoundedwhen considering the interactions of herbal medicinesbecause they themselves are subject to a degree of variability. Variability of herbal medicines Botanical extracts differ from conventional medicines in that they are complicated mixtures of many bioactive com- pounds. This makes it difficult to assess the contribution ofeach constituent to the activity of the whole, and thisincludes evaluating their possible interactions with drugs. Natural products are also liable to a great deal of variation and, even when standardised to one of more of theirconstituents, there can still be differences in the numerous other compounds present, and different constituents will affect different metabolic enzymes. As well as the sourcematerial, the method by which an extract is made will alsoaffect its composition, and thus its interaction potential. This is well illustrated by a study looking at echinacea prepar- ations. This study found that a and CYP3A4, with CYP3A4 being the most affected. However, when this and a number of other products were screened for their ability toinhibit CYP3A4, the inhibitory potencies of the products were found to vary by a factor of 150. 1 Sometimes, the overall effect of a herbal extract has a different effect on cytochrome P450 than that of an isolated constituent contained in the extract. For example, a mixture6 General considerationsof dietary soya isoflavones containing genistein was found to have no effect on rathepatic CYP1A2 and CYP2E1,2 whereas isolated genistein was found to inhibit bothCYP2E1 and CYP1A2 in experimental studies. 3Whether this is because of a species difference, a dose-related effect or opposing actions of some constituents within the extract remains to be seen, but it provides another illustration of thedangers of extrapolating results from different types ofexperiments on individual components to a clinical situation involving a whole mixture. These brief examples start to illustrate that the mechan- isms of drug interactions with herbal medicines bear a great relationship to those of conventional drugs. 1.

Mechanisms of drug interactions Some drugs interact together in totally unique ways, but, as the many examples in this publication amply illustrate, there are certain mechanisms of interaction that are encounteredtime and time again. Some of these common mechanisms arediscussed here in greater detail than space will allow in the individual monographs, so that only the briefest reference need be made there. This discussion is restricted to thosemechanisms that have been extensively investigated with herbal medicines. Readers interested in a more general discussion of mechanisms are referred to Stockley 's Drug Interactions . Very many drugs that interact do so, not by a single mechanism, but often by two or more mechanisms acting inconcert, although for clarity most of the mechanisms aredealt with here as though they occur in isolation. Forconvenience, the mechanisms of interactions can be subdiv- ided into those that involve the pharmacokinetics of a drug, and those that are pharmacodynamic. Pharmacokinetic interactions Pharmacokinetic interactions are those that can affect theprocesses by which drugs are absorbed, distributed, metab-olised and excreted (the so-called ADME interactions).Although all these mechanisms are undoubtedly relevant to interactions with herbal medicines, this discussion will mainly focus on cytochrome P450 and drug transporterproteins. Other enzymes have been shown to play a role inthe interactions of herbal medicines, such as UDP-glucur- onyltransferases (UGTs), but less is known about their effects. Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes Although a few drugs are cleared from the body simply bybeing excreted unchanged in the urine, most are chemicallyaltered within the body to less lipid-soluble compounds,which are more easily excreted by the kidneys. If this were not so, many drugs would persist in the body and continue to exert their effects for a long time. Some drug metabolismgoes on in the serum, the kidneys, the skin and the intestines,but the greatest proportion is carried out by enzymes that are found in the liver, mainly cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450 is not a single entity, but is in fact a very large familyof related isoenzymes, about 30 of which have been found in human liver tissue. However, in practice, only a few specific subfamilies seem to be responsible for most (about 90%) ofthe metabolism of the commonly these isoenzymes are also found in the gut wall.

The presence of an in vitro effect suggests that clinical study is warranted.8 General considerations(a) Enzyme induction Some herbal medicines can have a marked effect on the extent of first-pass metabolism of conventional drugs by inducing the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the gut wall or in the liver. A number of herbs have been studied specificallyfor their effects on these isoenzymes. Those that appear tocause clinically relevant induction of specific isoenzymes are grouped in a series of tables, along with the conventional drugs that are substrates for this isoenzyme. See the tablesDrugs and herbs affecting or metabolised by the cytochromeP450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, page 7, and Drugs and herbs affecting or metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, page 8. The extent of the enzyme induction depends on the herbal medicine, its dosage, and even the specific extract used (seeVariability of herbal medicines, page 6). It may take days oreven 2 to 3 weeks to develop fully, and may persist for asimilar length of time when the enzyme inducer is stopped. This means that enzyme induction interactions can be delayed in onset and slow to resolve. These effects havebeen seen with St John 's wort, page 362. If one drug reduces the effects of another by enzyme induction, it may be possible to accommodate the interactionsimply by raising the dosage of the drug affected, but thisrequires good monitoring, and there are obvious hazards ifthe inducing drug is eventually stopped without remember- ing to reduce the dosage again. The raised drug dosage may be an overdose when the drug metabolism has returned tonormal. This strategy is more complicated with herbal medicines; the intake of a set amount of the herbal medicine would need to be maintained for this approach to work, andthis is difficult because the interacting constituent may varybetween products, and even between different batches of the same product. (b) Enzyme inhibition More common than enzyme induction is the inhibition of enzymes. This results in the reduced metabolism of anaffected drug, so that it may begin to accumulate within the body, the effect usually being essentially the same as when the dosage is increased. Unlike enzyme induction, whichmay take several days or even weeks to develop fully,enzyme inhibition can occur within 2 to 3 days, resulting in the rapid development of toxicity. An example is the effect of grapefruit and grapefruit juice, which seem to inhibit thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, mainly in the gut, and therefore reduce the metabolism of oral calcium-channel blockers. See Grapefruit + Calcium-channel blockers,page 237. A number of herbs have been studied specifically for their effects on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Those that appearto have clinically relevant effects on specific isoenzymes aregrouped in a series of tables, along with the conventionaldrugs that are substrates for this isoenzyme. See the tables Drugs and herbs affecting or metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, page 7, by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, page 8. The clinical significance of many enzyme inhibition interactions depends on the extent to which the serum levels of the drug rise. If the serum levels remain within thetherapeutic range the interaction may not be clinicallyimportant. (c) Predicting interactions involving cytochrome P450 It is interesting to know which particular isoenzyme isresponsible for the metabolism of drugs because by doing in vitro tests with human liver enzymes it is often possible to explain why and how some drugs interact. For example, ciclosporin is metabolised by CYP3A4, and we know that St John 's wort is a potent inducer of this isoenzyme, so that it comes as no surprise that St John 's wort, page 368, reduces the effects of ciclosporin. What is very much more important than retrospectively finding out why drugs and herbal medicines interact is theknowledge that such in vitro tests can provide about forecasting which other drugs may possibly also interact.This may reduce the numbers of expensive clinical studies insubjects and patients and avoids waiting until significantdrug interactions are observed in clinical use. A lot of effort is being put into this area of drug development, and it is particularly important for herbal medicines, where it seemsunlikely that expensive clinical studies will be routinelyconducted. However, at present such prediction is not always accurate because all of the many variables that can come into play are not known (such as how much of the enzyme isavailable, the concentration of the drug at the site of metabolism and the affinity of the drug for the enzyme). Remember too that some drugs can be metabolised by morethan one cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (meaning may be able to 'pick up 'more metabolism to compensate for the inhibited pathway), some drugs (andtheir metabolites) can both induce a particular isoenzymeand be metabolised by it, and some drugs (or theirmetabolites) can inhibit a particular isoenzyme but not be metabolised by it. With so many factors possibly impinging on the outcome of giving two or more drugs together, it isvery easy to lose sight of one of the factors (or not even know about it) so that the sum of 2 plus 2 may not turn out to be the 4 that you have predicted. Drug transporter proteins Drugs and endogenous substances are known to crossbiological membranes, not just by passive diffusion, but also by carrier-mediated processes, often known as transporters. Significant advances in the identification of various trans-porters have been made, although the contribution of many of these to drug interactions in particular, is still being investigated. The most well-known drug transporter proteinis P-glycoprotein. More and more evidence is accumulating to show that some drug interactions occur because they interfere with theactivity of P-glycoprotein. This is an efflux pump found inthe membranes of certain cells, which can push metabolitesand drugs out of the cells and have an impact on the extent of drug absorption (via the intestine), distribution (to the brain, testis or placenta) and elimination (in the urine and bile). So,for example, the P-glycoprotein in the cells of the gut lining can eject some already-absorbed drug molecules back into the intestine resulting in a reduction in the total amount ofdrug absorbed. In this way P-glycoprotein acts as a barrier toabsorption. The activity of P-glycoprotein in the endothelialGeneral considerations 9cells of the blood -brain barrier can also eject certain drugs from the brain, limiting CNS penetration and effects. The pumping actions of P-glycoprotein can be experi- mentally induced or inhibited by some herbal medicines. So for example, the induction (or stimulation) of the activity of P-glycoprotein by capsicum, within the lining cells of the gut, causes digoxin to be ejected into the gut morevigorously. This may result in a fall in the plasma levels ofdigoxin. See Capsicum + Digoxin, page 116. In contrast, some extracts of danshen appear to inhibit the activity of P-glycoprotein, and may therefore increase digoxin levels.See Danshen + Digoxin, page 162. There is an between CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors, inducers and substrates. Digoxin is an example ofone of the few drugs that is a substrate for P-glycoprotein butnot CYP3A4. It is for this reason that it is used as a probe substrate for P-glycoprotein activity, and the effects of herbal medicines on this particular drug have been studied. Other transporters that are involved in some drug inter- actions are the organic anion transporters (OATs), organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and organic cation (OCTs), which are members of the solute carriersuperfamily (SLC) of transporters. The best known exampleof an OAT inhibitor is probenecid, which affects the renal excretion of a number of drugs. However, the effects of many herbal medicines and drugs on these transporters areless well understood than those of P-glycoprotein, and thus,the role of OATs, OATPs and OCTs in drug interactions is still being elucidated. Pharmacodynamic interactions Pharmacodynamic interactions are those where the effects of one drug are changed by the presence of another drug at its site of action. Sometimes the drugs directly compete for particular receptors but often the reaction is more indirectand involves interference with physiological mechanisms. These interactions are much less easy to classify neatly than those of a pharmacokinetic type. (a) Additive or synergistic interactions If two drugs that have the same pharmacological effect aregiven together the effects can be additive. For example,alcohol depresses the CNS and, if taken in moderate amounts with normal therapeutic doses of herbal medicines (e.g. valerian), may increase drowsiness. See Valerian +Alcohol, page 397. Sometimes the additive effects are solely toxic (e.g. theoretical additive nephrotoxicity, see Ginkgo + Aminogly-cosides, page 209). It is use the terms 'additive ', 'summation ','synergy 'or'potentiation 'to describe what happens if two or more drugs behave like this. These wordshave precise pharmacological definitions but they are oftenused rather loosely as synonyms because in practice it isoften very difficult to know the extent of the increased activity, that is to say whether the effects are greater or smaller than the sum of the individual effects. One particular additive effect is well known to occur between the herbal medicine St John' s wort, page 362, and conventional medicines. This is serotonin syndrome. Thereasons for this effect are not fully understood, but theserotonin syndrome is thought to occur as a result of over-stimulation of the 5-HT 1Aand 5-HT 2Areceptors and possibly other serotonin receptors in the CNS (in the brain stem and spinal cord in particular) due to the combined effects of two medicines (herbal or conventional). Serotoninsyndrome can occur exceptionally after taking only one substance that causes over-stimulation of these 5-HT receptors, but much more usually it develops when two ormore drugs (so-called serotonergic or serotomimetic drugs)act in concert. The characteristic symptoms fall into three main areas, namely altered mental status (agitation, confu- sion, mania), autonomic (hyperre-flexia, incoordination, myoclonus, tremor). The syndrome can develop shortly after one serotonergic drug is added to another, or even if one is replaced byanother without allowing a long enough washout period in between, and the problem usually resolves within about 24 hours if both drugs are withdrawn and supportivemeasures given. Non-specific serotonin antagonists (cypro-heptadine, chlorpromazine, methysergide) have also been used for treatment. Most patients recover uneventfully, but there have been a few fatalities. It is still not at all clear why many patients can take two, or sometimes several, serotonergic drugs together without problems, while a very small number develop this serious toxic reaction, but it certainly suggests that there are otherfactors involved that have yet to be identified. The full storyis likely to be much more complex than just the simple additive effects of two drugs. (b) Antagonistic or opposing interactions In contrast to additive interactions, there are some pairs of drugs with activities that are opposed to one another. Forexample, the coumarins can prolong the blood clotting time by competitively inhibiting the effects of dietary vitamin K. If the intake of vitamin K is increased, the effects of the oralanticoagulant are opposed and the prothrombin time can return to normal, thereby cancelling out the therapeutic benefits of anticoagulant treatment. It has been proposed thatthe vitamin K content of herbal medicines may be sufficientto provoke this interaction, but in most cases of normal intake of the herb, this seems unlikely. See Alfalfa + Warfarin and related drugs, page 23, for further discussion ofthis potential interaction. Drawing your own conclusions The human population is a total mixture, unlike selectedbatches of laboratory animals (same age, weight, sex, strain,etc.). For this reason human beings do not respond uniformlyto one or more drugs or even herbal medicines. Our genetic make-up, ethnic background, sex, renal and hepatic func- tions, diseases and nutritional states, ages and other factors(the route of administration, for example) all contributetowards the heterogeneity of our responses. This means that the outcome of giving one or more drugs to any individual for the first time is never totally predictable because it is anew and unique 'experiment '. Even so, some idea of the probable outcome of using a drug or a pair of drugs can bebased on what has been seen in other patients: the moreextensive the data, the firmer the predictions. The most difficult decisions concern isolated cases of10 General considerationsinteraction, many of which achieved prominence only because they were serious. Do you ignore them as 'idiosyn- cratic 'or do you, from that moment onwards, advise against the use of the herbal medicine and conventional drug totally? There is no simple yes or no answer to these questions, especially as evidence regarding interactions between herbalmedicines is often only of an experimental nature. Thedelicate balance between whether or not to give the drug hasthen to be set against the actual severity of the reaction reported and weighed up against how essential it is to use the combination in question. When deciding the possible first-time use of any two drugs in any particular patient, you need to put what is currently known about these drugs against the particular profile of your patient. Read the monograph. Consider thefacts and conclusions, and then set the whole against the backdrop of your patient 's unique condition (age, disease, general condition, and so forth) so that what you eventually decide to do is well thought out and soundly based. We donot usually have the luxury of knowing absolutely all the facts, so that an initial conservative approach is often the safest.It is now quite impossible to remember all the known clinically important interactions and how they occur but there are some broad general principles that are worth remembering: .Be on the alert with any drugs that have a narrow therapeutic window or where it is necessary to keep serum levels at or above a suitable level about the basic pharmacology of the drugs under consideration so that obvious problems (additive CNS depression, for example) are not overlooked, and try to think what might happen if drugs that affect the samereceptors are used together. And don 't forget that many drugs affect more than one type of receptor. .Keep in mind that the elderly are at risk because ofreduced liver and renal function on which drug clearancedepends.General considerations 11Acidophilus Lactobacillus acidophilus (Lactobacillaceae) Use and indications Lactobacillus acidophilus are lactic-acid producing bacterial organisms that are normally present in the human gut. Acidophilus supplements are primarily taken as a probiotic,to restore or maintain healthy microbial flora. Acidophilus has also been used to treat diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, urinary tract infections andyeast-based infections (such as those caused by Candida albicans ), and for general digestive problems. It is available in various forms ranging from capsules to yoghurts.Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview Acidophilus is a bacterial organism, and therefore it may lead to systemic infection in immunosuppressed patients, although this effect is expected to be rare. Antibacterials anddrugs that are dependent on bacterial degradation to releaseactive constituents, namely sulfasalazine, may also be expected to interact.A 13Acidophilus + Antibacterials The interaction between acidophilus and antibacterials is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Lactobacillus acidophilus are Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacteria and as such can be inhibited or killed by antibacterials that are effective against this type of acidophilus populations. Mechanism Antibacterials kill or inhibit the growth of bacterial populations through various different mechanisms. Importance and management Depending on the particular strain of acidophilus and the antibacterial dose, the desired therapeutic effect of acidophilus may be significantly reduced or even abolished by these anti- bacterials. 1.

Acidophilus is often present in live yoghurt. Acidophilus + Herbal medicines; Soya isoflavones Acidophilus does not generally affect the metabolism of soya isoflavones. Clinical evidence In a randomised study 20 women who had been successfully treated for breast cancer and 20 women without a history of cancer weregiven a soya protein isolate containing acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum , daily for 42 days. In general, the probiotics did not affect the plasma isoflavoneconcentrations, although two of the subjects had altered plasmaconcentrations of equol, a daidzein metabolite. No adverse effectswere reported in the study. 1In another study, the same probiotic did not alter the cholesterol-lowering effects of the isoflavones.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found.MechanismThe gut bacterial flora metabolises daidzein to equol, which is thought to be responsible for reduced breast cancer risk. The authorshypothesised that increasing the populations of bacteria, by usingprobiotics, levels of equol would increase. Importance and management Increasing the populations of bacteria in the gut does not appear to have a significant effect on the metabolism of soya isoflavones. Notethat the metabolism of isoflavones is variable, due to differences ingut flora between individuals, and so the effects of any interactionbetween acidophilus and isoflavones are likely to differ between individuals. For more information on the interactions of isoflavones in general, see under isoflavones, page 258. 1. Nettleton JA, Greany KA, Thomas W, Wangen KE, Adlercreutz H, Kurzer MS.

Acidophilus + Immunosuppressants An isolated case report describes fatal septicaemia in an immunosuppressed woman taking cyclophosphamide and flu-drocortisone who ate live yoghurt containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus, which is closely related to acidophilus. Clinical evidence A 42-year-old woman taking cyclophosphamide andfludrocortisone for Sj\u00f6gren 's syndrome developed pneumonia and secondary Lactobacillus rhamnosus septicaemia, which proved to be fatal, after taking a short course of supermarket own-brand live yoghurt for diarrhoea.1Note that Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a species closely related to Lactobacillus acidophilus . Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The immunosuppressed nature of the patient is thought to have provided a more conducive environment for the introduced bacteriato establish a sufficient population to reach a pathogenic threshold. Importance and management Although not a drug interaction in the strictest sense, it would be sensible to assume that introducing bacteria in the form of aprobiotic to an immunosuppressed patient should be undertaken withgreat care or perhaps avoided: note that patients who haveundergone a transplantation and who are immunosuppressed areoften advised to avoid foods such as live yoghurts. Remember that, as immunosuppression secondary to corticoster- oid use is dependent on numerous factors related to the dosage and duration of intake, not all patients taking corticosteroids are likely to be immunosuppressed and therefore they will not necessarily need toavoid acidophilus-containing products. 1. MacGregor G, Smith AJ, Yoghurt biotherapy: contraindicated in (2002) Acidophilus Sulfasalazine The interaction between acidophilus and sulfasalazine is basedon experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found.14 Acidophilus AExperimental evidence In an experimental study about 85 to 95% of a dose of sulfasalazine was broken down by several different strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus .1 Mechanism The azo link of sulfasalazine is split by anaerobic bacteria in the colon to release sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid, the latterbeing the active metabolite that acts locally in the treatment ofinflammatory bowel disease. The lipophilic nature of sulfasalazine isthought to enable it to reach the site of azoreductase activity withinthe bacterial cell by passive diffusion across the cell membrane. Importance and management Sulfasalazine is generally thought to be 'activated 'by its metabolismto release 5-aminosalicylic acid by bacteria in the colon. By introducing more bacteria, the metabolism could be increased.However, metabolism may also occur earlier, in the small intestine, which could be detrimental as one metabolite, sulfapyridine, is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine and can contribute to renaltoxicity. It should be noted, however, that this is a rather old experimental study that appears to be the only one of its kind in the literature.Also, the pH of the gut is much lower than the pH used in theexperimental study and there is a degree of interindividual variabilityin populations of bacterial flora. Taking all this into account, this interaction seems unlikely to be clinically relevant. 1. Pradhan A, Majumdar MK. Metabolism of some drugs by and their toxicological considerations. Acta Chaste tree, Monk 's pepper. Pharmacopoeias Agnus Castus (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Chaste Tree ( USP 32 ). Constituents Agnus castus is usually standardised to the content of the flavonoid casticin (dried ripe fruit and powdered extracts contain a minimum of 0.08%, USP 32 ), and sometimes also the iridoid glycoside agnuside (dried ripe fruit and powdered extracts contain a minimum of 0.05%, USP 32 ). Other major constituents penduletin. Use and indications Traditional use of the dried ripe fruit of agnus castus focuses on menstrual disorders in women resulting from corpus luteum deficiency, such as amenorrhoea, metrorrhagia and symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, including mastalgia. Ithas also been used to alleviate some menopausal symptomsand to promote lactation. In men it has been used to suppress libido and treat acne. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data for agnus castus found.For information the pharmacokinetics individual flavonoids present in agnus castus, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview A comprehensive systematic review of data from spontan- eous adverse event reporting schemes and published clinicalstudies, post-marketing surveillance studies, surveys and case reports was carried out in September 2004 to investigate the safety of agnus castus extracts. No drug interactions wereidentified. 1Agnus castus extracts in the data andZE 440 . However, agnus castus has dopamine agonist properties, and may therefore interact with drugs with either dopamineagonist or dopamine antagonist actions. Agnus castus contains oestrogenic compounds but it is unclear whether the effects of these compounds are additive,or antagonistic, to oestrogens and oestrogen antagonists (e.g.tamoxifen). Although agnus castus binds with opioid receptors, no serious interaction with opioid analgesics would be expected. For information on the interactions of flavonoids, see under flavonoids, page 186. 1. Daniele C, Thompson Coon J, Pittler MH, Ernst E. Vitex agnus castus : a systematic review of adverse effects. Drug Safety (2005) 28, 319 -32.A 16Agnus castus + Dopamine agonists or antagonists Agnus castus has dopamine agonist properties, and may therefore interact with drugs with either dopamine agonist or dopamine antagonist actions. Clinical evidence In a double-blind study in women suffering from mastalgia, agnus castus extracts reduced serum prolactin levels (by about 4 nano-grams/mL compared with about 0.6 nanograms/mL for placebo). 1 The agnus castus extracts used in this study were an oral solution, Mastodynon, and a tablet, MA 1025 E1.1 Experimental evidence Extracts of agnus castus act as dopaminergic compounds (mainly isolated from agnus castus almost identical prolactin-suppressiveproperties at the D 2-receptor to dopamine.3 Mechanism Active compounds of agnus castus and dopaminergics may have additive effects because of their similar pharmacological activity. Importance and management While the importance of any potential interaction is difficult to judge, it would be wise to exercise some caution with the concurrent use of agnus castus and dopaminergics that act at the D 2-receptor, which is the majority. For dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine and apomorphine , additive effects and toxicity is a theoretical possibility. Conversely, for dopamine antagonists such as the antipsychotics and some antiemetics (such as metoclopramide and prochlorperazine ), antagonistic effects are a theoretical possibility. 1.

Agnus Oestrogens or Oestrogen antagonists Agnus castus contains compounds. This may result in additive effects with oestrogens or it may oppose the effects of oestrogens. Similarly, agnus castus may have additive effectswith oestrogen antagonists or oppose the effects of oestrogenantagonists (e.g. tamoxifen). Clinical evidence A 32-year-old woman took a herbal medicine made from agnus castus, on her own initiative, before and in the early follicular phase ofher fourth cycle of unstimulated IVF ( in vitro fertilisation) treatment in order to try to promote ovarian function. In this cycle, shedeveloped four follicles, and her serum agnus castus and she experienced symptoms suggestive of mild ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in the luteal phase. Two subsequent cycles were endocrinologically normal with single follicles, as werethe three cycles before she took the herbal preparation. 1 It has also been suggested that agnus castus may provide relief from menopausal symptoms, see under Chinese angelica, page 129. Experimental evidence In receptor-binding studies, extracts of agnus castus were found to contain the flavonoids penduletin, apigenin vitexin, which arethought to have some oestrogenic effects. Apigenin was identified asthe most active, but all were selective for the oestrogen-betareceptor. 2,3 Mechanism Active compounds of agnus castus may compete for the same oestrogen receptor as hormonal drugs and treatment. The case report suggests that agnus castus has anti-oestrogenic effects (leading toincreased FSH and LH). The in vitro evidence suggests oestrogenic activity. Importance and management Evidence is limited and largely speculative, and it is therefore difficult to predict the outcome of using agnus castus with oestrogens or oestrogen antagonists. The evidence suggests that compounds of agnus castus may compete for the same oestrogenreceptor as conventional hormonal drugs, with the outcome of eitheran overall oestrogenic effect, or an overall oestrogen antagonisteffect (see also Chinese angelica, page 129). The main compoundsin agnus castus that have oestrogenic activity are and they are found, particularly apigenin, ubiquitously in foods and herbs. Phytoestrogens are generally much less potent than endogenous oestrogens and therefore anypotential interaction is likely to be modest. However, note that it isprobably inappropriate for patients undergoing IVF treatment to takehormonally active herbal medicines, unless under the advice of anexperienced endocrinologist. Further study is needed. 1. Cahill DJ, Fox R, Wardle PG, Harlow CR. Multiple follicular development associated with herbal medicine. Hum Reprod (1994) 9, 1469 -70. 2.

Experimental evidence Various agnus castus extracts have been shown to have an affinity to opioid receptors in an in vitro study. 1Lipophilic extracts of agnus castus produced an inhibition of binding to - and -opioid receptors and the aqueous fraction produced an inhibition of binding to-opioid AA of agnus castus acted as agonists at the -opioid receptor in a similar way to morphine, another opioid agonist. Mechanism Active compounds of agnus castus and opioids may have additive effects because of their similar pharmacological activity. Importance and management The importance of this action on opioid receptors is unknown.Agnus castus is not known for any strong analgesic effects or for producing opioid-like dependence and, as no clinical interactionshave been reported, it seems unlikely that any important interaction will occur with opioids. 1.

Constituents Agrimony may be standardised to a tannin content expressed aspyrogallol 2%. Other phytosterols; salicylic and silicic acids. Use and indications The dried flowering tops are used as a mild astringent anddiuretic. They have also been used for diarrhoea in children,mucous colitis, urinary incontinence, cystitis, and as sore throats and catarrh. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found specifically for agrimony, but see under flavonoids, page 186, for more detail on individual flavonoids present in the herb. Interactions overview Information on the interactions of flavonoid supplements arecovered under flavonoids, page 186, but note that it isunlikely that agrimony would be taken in doses large enoughto give the levels of individual flavonoids used in the flavonoid studies (e.g. quercetin 100 mg daily and above). Agrimony might have a weak blood-glucose-lowering effect,and has weak diuretic and blood pressure-lowering effects. It may therefore be expected to interact with conventional drugs that have these properties.A 19Agrimony + Antidiabetics The interaction between agrimony and antidiabetics is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In various in vitro and animal studies, high-dose agrimony has stimulated insulin secretion and reduced hyperglycaemia.1,2This suggests that usual doses used as a herbal medicine might have a weak antidiabetic effect, which could be additive with the effects ofantidiabetic drugs. Mechanism Additive pharmacological effects. Importance and management These experimental studies provide limited evidence of a possible blood-glucose-lowering effect of agrimony extracts. Because of thenature of the evidence, applying these results in a clinical setting isextremely difficult. However, if patients taking antidiabetic drugswant to take agrimony it may be prudent to discuss these potentialadditive effects, and advise an increase in blood-glucose monitoring, should an interaction be suspected. 1.

Experimental evidence Agrimony has traditionally been used as a diuretic. One study in rats found that agrimony had little significant diuretic activity,1and another in cats found that intravenous agrimony decreased blood pressure over a period of 20 minutes.2 Mechanism It is possible that the herb will have weak antihypertensive effects, and a slight additive reduction in blood pressure could be possible if it is given with antihypertensives. Importance and management These experimental studies provide limited evidence of a possible antihypertensive effect of agrimony extracts. Because of the natureof the evidence, applying these results in a clinical setting isextremely difficult and, until more is known, it would be unwise toadvise anything other than general caution. 1.

Constituents The main active constituents of alfalfa are the isoflavones , which include biochanin A ,formononetin ,daidzein hederagenin, medicagenic acid and soyasapogenols A -E. Other components include the toxic amino acid canavanine; natural coumarins such as and beta- miscellaneous compounds including vitamins (notably vitamin K), porphyrins, alkaloids (e.g. stachydrine),sugars, minerals and trace elements. Use and indications Alfalfa herb is usually used as a source of nutrients,including vitamins. Alfalfa seeds, when germinated, arepopular as salad sprouts. Alfalfa has therapeutic propertiesincluding lowering blood cholesterol (the saponins) andoestrogenic activity (see isoflavones, page 258). A possible association between alfalfa and systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported. This has been attributed tothe toxic constituent canavanine, which is a structural analogue of arginine and may interfere with arginine functions. 1 Pharmacokinetics No relevant data for alfalfa found. For information on thepharmacokinetics of its isoflavone constituents genistein,daidzein and biochanin A, see isoflavones, page 258. Interactions overview Although it has been suggested that alfalfa may interact withantidiabetic medicines and anticoagulants, evidence for this is largely lacking. Alfalfa may interact with immunosup- pressants, and has apparently caused transplant rejection inone patient. Potential interactions of specific isoflavoneconstituents of alfalfa are covered under isoflavones; see antibacterials, page 260, digoxin, page 261, fexofenadine, page 261, nicotine, page 261, paclitaxel, page 261, tamox-ifen, page 262, and theophylline, page 263. 1.

For the theoretical possibility that broad- spectrum antibacterials might reduce the metabolism of theisoflavone constituents of alfalfa, such as daidzein, by colonicbacteria, and so alter their efficacy, see Isoflavones + Antibacterials,page 260. Alfalfa + Antidiabetics An isolated case describes a marked reduction in blood-glucoselevels in a diabetic patient who took an alfalfa extract. Clinical evidence A case report describes a young man with poorly controlled diabetes (reportedly requiring large doses of insulin for even moderatelysatisfactory control) who had a marked reduction in blood-glucoselevels after taking an oral alfalfa aqueous extract. He also had a reduction in his blood-glucose levels in response to oral manganese chloride, but this effect was not seen in 8 other patients withdiabetes. 1 Experimental evidence In a study in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, high levels of alfalfa in the diet (62.5 g/kg) and drinking water (2.5 g/L) resulted in glucose levels that were similar to those in non-diabetic control mice and markedly lower than those in streptozotocin diabetic controlmice. 2Insulin-releasing and insulin-like activity was demonstrated for various extracts of alfalfa in vitro .2 Mechanism The authors of the case report (from 1962) concluded that the effect of alfalfa was due to the manganese content,1but a subsequent in vitro study discounted a major role for manganese.2 Importance and management Evidence is very limited, with just one early case report in an atypical patient and an animal study using very high doses of alfalfa. There are insufficient data to recommend any action, but it appearsunlikely that usual herbal doses of alfalfa will have much, if any,effect on diabetic control. 1.

Alfalfa + Food No interactions found.Alfalfa + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Alfalfa + Immunosuppressants An isolated report describes acute rejection and vasculitis with alfalfa and/or black cohosh in a renal transplant recipient taking ciclosporin. Clinical evidence A stable kidney transplant recipient taking azathioprine 50 mg daily and ciclosporin 75 mg twice daily began to take alfalfa and blackcohosh supplements (specific products not stated) on medical advicefor severe menopausal symptoms. Her serum creatinine rose from between about 97 and 124 micromol/L up to 168 micromol/L after 4 weeks, and to 256 micromol/L after 6 weeks with no associatedchange in her ciclosporin levels. Biopsy revealed severe acuterejection with vasculitis and she was treated with corticosteroids andanti-T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin with partial improvement inrenal function. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Alfalfa has been reported to cause worsening of systemic lupus erythematosus and immunostimulation, and it was suggested thatimmunostimulation may have contributed to the acute rejection inthis patient. 1 Importance and management The evidence of an interaction between alfalfa/black cohosh and immunosuppressants is limited, with the mechanism suggesting thatalfalfa is the more likely culprit, although an effect of black cohoshcannot be ruled out. As the effects were so severe in this case itwould seem prudent to avoid the use of alfalfa supplements inpatients receiving immunosuppressants for serious indications, such as organ transplantation. Similarly, it would seem prudent to avoid the use of alfalfa in those taking immunosuppressants for indicationssuch as eczema, psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis; however, if thesepatients particularly wish to take alfalfa a short-term trial ofconcurrent use is likely to be less hazardous, but patients should becounselled about the possible risks (i.e. loss of disease control). 1.

Note that paclitaxel is used intravenously, and the effect of biochanin A on intravenous paclitaxel does not appear to have been evaluated.22 Alfalfa AAlfalfa + Tamoxifen No data for alfalfa found. Data relating to the use of the isoflavone constituents of alfalfa, such as biochanin A, daidzein and genistein,with tamoxifen are covered under Isoflavones + Tamoxifen, page 262. Alfalfa + Theophylline No data for alfalfa found. For the possibility that high doses ofdaidzein present in alfalfa might modestly increase theophyllinelevels, see Isoflavones + Theophylline, page 263. Alfalfa + Warfarin and related drugs Unintentional and unwanted antagonism of warfarin hasoccurred in patients who ate exceptionally large amounts of some green vegetables, which can contain significant amounts of vitamin K 1. It is predicted that alfalfa may contain sufficient vitamin K to provoke a similar reaction. Evidence There is no specific clinical or experimental evidence relating to the use of alfalfa with anticoagulants, but alfalfa is predicted toantagonise coumarin anticoagulants based on its vitamin K content. There are some data on the amount of vitamin K in alfalfa, and lots of data on dietary vitamin K and anticoagulant control. (a) Vitamin K 1content of alfalfa Alfalfa supplements are often promoted on the basis that they contain significant amounts of vitamin K 1, although packaging rarely gives an amount. Alfalfa greens were used in early studiesfrom the 1930s when vitamin K was first identified. In one such study, the amount of vitamin K activity in dried alfalfa was about half that in dried spinach. 1Green leafy vegetables such as spinach are well known to contain high levels of vitamin K 1, with modern assay techniques giving values of about 500 micrograms/100 g.2 Conversely, sprouted alfalfa seeds have been shown to contain far more modest amounts of vitamin K 1(in the region of 30 mic- rograms/100 ).2It is likely that the seeds themselves would contain even less vitamin K 1. Therefore, the amount of vitamin K 1in an alfalfa product is likely to depend on the part of the plant used, andwould be highest from the green leaf material and lowest from theseeds. In addition, the way the product is extracted (vitamin K 1is a fat- soluble vitamin) would affect the vitamin K 1content. For example, although the leaves of green tea themselves are high in vitamin K 1, the brew prepared from the leaves contains very little vitamin K 1.3 Therefore an aqueous infusion prepared from alfalfa dried herbwould be unlikely to contain much vitamin K 1. Moreover, although the dried herb itself contains high levels of vitamin K 1, it is taken in modest amounts in the form of supplements when compared with,for example, eating spinach as part of a meal. If a capsule containing500 mg of powdered alfalfa leaf is taken at a dose of four capsulesthree times daily, then the daily intake of alfalfa would be 6 g, whichmight contain in the region of 15 micrograms of vitamin K daily. This amount seems unlikely to generally affect the response to vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants (such as warfarin), and manyproducts contain less alfalfa than this. (b) Dietary vitamin K and warfarin activity There is evidence that the average dietary vitamin K 1intake is correlated with the efficacy of warfarin. In one study, patientsconsuming a diet containing more than 250 micrograms daily of vitamin K 1had a lower INR 5 days after starting warfarin than patients consuming less dietary vitamin K 1(median INR 1.9 versus 3). Also, the group consuming large amounts of vitamin K 1needed a higher maintenance warfarin dose (5.7 mg/day versus 3.5 mg/day).4 In another study, multiple regression analysis indicated that, inpatients taking warfarin, the INR was altered by 1, by a weeklychange in the intake of vitamin K 1of 714 micrograms.5Similarly, for each increase in daily dietary vitamin K 1intake of 100 micrograms, the INR decreased by 0.2 in another study.6 In a randomised, crossover study in patients taking warfarin or phenprocoumon, increasing the dietary intake of vitamin K 1by 500% relative to the baseline value (from 118 to 591 microgramsdaily) for 4 days only modestly decreased the INR from 3.1 to 2.8 onday 4. Decreasing the dietary intake of vitamin K 1by 80% (from 118 to 26 micrograms daily) for 4 days increased the INR from 2.6 to 3.3on day 7. 7 There is some evidence that patients with a very low dietary vitamin K 1intake are more sensitive to alterations in intake, and have less stable anticoagulant control. For example, in one study,patients with unstable anticoagulant control were found to have amuch lower dietary intake of vitamin K 1, when compared with another group of patients with stable anticoagulant control(29 micrograms daily versus 76 micrograms daily). 8In another study in 10 patients with poor anticoagulant control takingacenocoumarol, a diet with a low, controlled vitamin K 1content of 20 to 40 micrograms daily increased the percentage of INR valueswithin the therapeutic range, when compared with a control group of10 patients not subjected to any dietary restrictions. 9 Mechanism The coumarin and indanedione oral anticoagulants are vitamin K antagonists, which inhibit the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase soreducing the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factorsby the liver. If the intake of dietary vitamin K 1increases, the synthesis of the blood clotting factors begins to return to normal. As a result theprothrombin time also begins to fall to its normal value. Naturally occurring vitamin K 1(phytomenadione) is found only in plants. The natural coumarins present in alfalfa are not considered to be anticoagulants, because they do not have the structural requirements for this activity. Importance and management Patients should be counselled on the effects of dietary vitamin K and the need to avoid dramatic dietary alterations while taking warfarin.It would be prudent to avoid large doses of alfalfa leaf supplementsas a precaution when taking warfarin or other coumarin antic-oagulants. Available evidence suggests that it is unlikely thatinfusions prepared with water, or alfalfa seeds, would pose any problem, due to the lower vitamin K 1content. 1. Dam H, Sch\u00f8nheyder F.

Constituents Aloe vera gel is contained in the mucilaginous tissue that is found in the inner leaf, and should not be confused withaloes, page 27, which is the latex stored in tubules along the leaf margin. Aloe vera gel may be produced by a hand- filleted technique to remove the inner leaf, or by a whole-leafextraction process where the aloes constituents (anthraqui-nones) are now usually subsequently removed (e.g. by charcoal filtration). The principal constituents of the gel are polysaccharides consisting mainly of polymannans, of which acemannan is the major one. Other constituents include glycoproteins such as aloctins, and various carboxypeptidases, sterols, saponins,tannins, organic acids, vitamins and minerals. Traces ofanthraquinone glycosides may also be present in prepar- ations. Use and indications Aloe vera is used topically to aid wound healing from cutsand burns, including sunburn, and is used in many cosmetic preparations such as moisturisers. It is reported to possess anti-inflammatory, antitumour, immunomodulatory and anti- bacterial properties. Internally, aloe vera is thought to beimmunostimulatory and to have mild analgesic, antioxidant and antidiabetic effects. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview Aloe vera contains only traces of anthraquinone glycosides, and would therefore not be expected to have any of the interactions of aloes, page 27, or similar herbal medicines, which occur, or are predicted to occur, as a result of theiranthraquinone content. Aloe vera may have blood-glucose-lowering properties and may therefore be expected to interact with conventionaldrugs that have the same effect. Aloe vera appears toenhance the absorption of some vitamins but the clinicalsignificance of this is not clear.A 24Aloe vera + Antidiabetics Aloe vera juice reduces blood-glucose levels in patients with diabetes taking glibenclamide. Clinical evidence In placebo-controlled clinical studies, aloe vera juice (80%), one tablespoonful twice daily for 42 days, reduced blood-glucose inpatients with diabetes, either taking glibenclamide ,1or not taking oral antidiabetic drugs,2from an average of 14 to 16 mmol/L down to 8 mmol/L over a period of 6 weeks. However, it should be notedthat, in the study in patients taking glibenclamide , there was, unexpectedly, no response to the use of glibenclamide alone. In these studies, the aloe vera juice (80%) was prepared from aloe gel andadditional flavours and preservatives. Experimental evidence There is extensive literature (not cited here) on the possible blood- glucose-lowering effect of various extracts of aloe vera in animal models of diabetes, with some studies showing an effect and othersnot. Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management It seems possible that some oral preparations of aloe vera might have a clinically important blood-glucose-lowering effect. Indeed, aloevera has traditionally been used to treat diabetes. It might thereforebe prudent to increase the frequency of blood-glucose monitoring ifpatients taking antidiabetic medication wish to try oral aloe verapreparations. 1.

Aloe vera + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Aloe vera + Sevoflurane An isolated case report tentatively attributed increased surgicalbleeding to the concurrent use of aloe vera and sevoflurane. Clinical evidence A 35-year-old woman, who had taken four aloe vera tablets (exact constituents and dose unknown) daily for 2 weeks before undergoinga procedure to excise a haemangioma from her left thigh, lost morethan double the amount of blood estimated before surgery. 1General anaesthesia was induced with propofol 110 mg, fentanyl 100 rocuronium by tracheal Sevoflurane to 1.3% was used to maintain anaesthesia with nitrous oxide in oxygen, which was supplemented by rocuronium70 mg and morphine 10.5 mg. The authors suggest that a possibleinteraction between sevoflurane and aloe vera contributed to theexcessive bleeding seen. Experimental evidence Aloe vera gel extracts inhibited prostaglandin synthesis in vitro , 2and might therefore have antiplatelet activity. Mechanism Sevoflurane can inhibit platelet aggregation by inhibiting thromb- oxane A 2, and aloe vera affects prostaglandin synthesis, which may also impair platelet aggregation. Therefore additive antiplateleteffects may have contributed to the excessive bleeding. 1 Importance and management An interaction between aloe vera and sevoflurane is based on a single case report and is by no means proven, especially as thepatient 's aPTT and INR were not assessed preoperatively and the authors do state that the vascularity and size of the haemangiomawere the most important factors in the blood loss. 1Because of limited information, the American Society of Anesthesiologists haverecommended discontinuation of all herbal medicines 2 weeksbefore an elective anaesthetic 3,4and, if there is any doubt about the safety of a product, this may be a prudent precaution.5 1.

Clinical evidence (a) Vitamin C In a single-dose, randomised study in 8 healthy subjects, aloe vera gel extract 60 mL appeared to enhance the absorption of vitamin C500 mg. The AUC of ascorbate was increased by about threefold. However, this difference was not statistically significant: it was attributed to the large interindividual differences. There was asecond maximum plasma ascorbate level at 8 hours with the gel, andplasma ascorbate was still detectable at 24 hours, suggesting thataloe vera gel might delay, as well as enhance, absorption.Conversely, aloe vera whole leaf extract 60 mL had no significanteffect on the absorption of vitamin C. 1 (b) Vitamin E In a single-dose, randomised study in 10 healthy subjects, aloe vera gel extract 60 mL increased the AUC of vitamin E 420 mg by3.7-fold. Aloe vera whole leaf extract 60 mL increased the AUC byabout twofold. However, the only statistically significant differencewas the increase in plasma tocopherol at 8 hours, which occurredwith both aloe vera extracts. The time to maximum level wasdelayed from 4 hours to 8 hours for the gel and to 6 hours for the leaf extract, suggesting that aloe vera might delay, as well as enhance, absorption. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The authors suggest that the vitamins may be protected from degradation in the intestine by flavonoid antioxidants in the aloeAloe vera 25 Avera extracts and by polysaccharides that may bind to the vitamins, delaying and increasing their absorption.1 Importance and management If confirmed, this appears to be a beneficial interaction, with aloevera exhibiting the potential to be an adjunct for patients requiring vitamin C and/or E supplementation. 1.

Constituents Not to be confused with Aloe vera, page 24, which is the gel contained in the mucilaginous tissue that is found in theinner leaf. Aloes is derived from the latex that is stored intubules along the margin of the leaf. When the outer leaf is cut, latex exudes from the leaf and this exudate, when dried, is aloes. Anthraquinone glycosides are major components of aloes and include barbaloin, a glycoside of aloe-emodin to which it may be standardised, and minor glycosides such as aloinosides A aloesin, aloeresin E, isoaloeresin D andfuroaloesone are also present in small amounts, as are resins.Use and indications Aloes has mainly been used internally as a laxative(although, note that this use has generally been superseded)and, in low concentrations, as a flavouring ingredient in foodand drink. Pharmacokinetics The anthraquinone, emodin, is present in aloes (and similarplants) principally as the inactive glycoside. It travels through the gut, and is then metabolised by microflora to produce the active aglycone emodin, some of which isabsorbed. Emodin is be metabolised tomore toxic metabolites by CYP1A2. However, the relevance of this to the clinical use of drugs (especially CYP1A2 substrates and inducers) is unclear. 1 Interactions overview Although aloes have been predicted to interact with anumber of drugs that lower potassium levels (such as thecorticosteroids and potassium-depleting diuretics), or drugs where the effects become potentially harmful when potas- sium is lowered (such as digoxin), there appears to be littleor no direct evidence that this occurs in practice. 1. Mueller ST, Stopper H, Dekant W. Biotransformation of 27Aloes + Corticosteroids Theoretically, the risk of hypokalaemia might be increased in patients taking corticosteroids, who also regularly use, or abuse,anthraquinone-containing substances such as aloes. Clinical evidence Chronic diarrhoea as a result of long-term use, or abuse, of stimulant laxatives such as aloes can cause excessive water and potassiumloss; this has led to metabolic acidosis in one case. 1Systemic corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid effects can cause waterretention and potassium loss. The effect of the over-use of aloescombined with systemic corticosteroids is not known, but, theor-etically at least, the risk of hypokalaemia might be increased.Although this is mentioned in some reviews 2there do not appear to be any reports describing clinical cases of this effect. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism In theory the additive loss of potassium, caused by anthraquinone- containing substances and systemic corticosteroids, may result inhypokalaemia. Importance and management The interaction between aloes and corticosteroids is theoretical, but be aware of the potential in patients who regularly use, or abuse,anthraquinone-containing substances such as aloes. However, notethat, if anthraquinone laxatives are used as recommended (at a doseproducing a comfortable soft-formed motion), then this interactionwould not be expected to be clinically relevant.

Aloes + Digitalis glycosides Theoretically, digitalis toxicity could develop if patients regu-larly use, or abuse, anthraquinone-containing substances such as aloes. Clinical evidence Chronic diarrhoea caused by the long-term use, or abuse, of stimulant laxatives such as aloes can cause excessive water andpotassium loss, which may cause hypokalaemia that could lead tothe development of digitalis toxicity. Although this is oftenmentioned in reviews 1,2there do not appear to be any reports describing clinical cases of this effect. However, for mention of acase of digoxin toxicity and mild hypokalaemia in a patient stabilised on digoxin and furosemide, who started to take a containing rhubarb andliquorice , see Liquorice + Digitalis glyco- sides, page 274. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Possible pharmacodynamic interaction. The risk of development of digitalis toxicity, including cardiac arrhythmias, is increased byhypokalaemia, which can be induced by the excessive use ofanthraquinone laxatives. Importance and management This is a theoretical interaction, but it may be prudent to exercisecaution in patients who are taking digitalis glycosides and who regularly use, or abuse, anthraquinone-containing substances such asaloes. However, note that, if anthraquinone laxatives are used as recommended (at a dose producing a comfortable soft-formed motion), then this interaction would not be expected to be clinicallyrelevant. Consider also Senna + Digitalis glycosides, page 350, forthe effects of anthraquinones on digoxin absorption. 1. Boudreau MD, Beland FA.

Medicinal herbs: a primer for primary Hosp Pract (1999) 34, Aloes + Diuretics; Potassium-depleting Theoretically, patients taking potassium-depleting diureticscould experience excessive potassium loss if they also regularlyuse, or abuse, anthraquinone-containing substances such asaloes. Clinical evidence The diuretics (i.e. loop diuretics andthiazide and related diuretics ) may cause potassium depletion. Chronic diarrhoea caused by long-term use, or abuse, of stimulant laxatives such as aloes, may also lead to excessive water loss and potassiumdeficiency. This, theoretically, could be increased by concurrent useof these diuretics. This interaction is sometimes mentioned in reviews; 1,2nevertheless, there is little, if any, direct evidence. There appears to be one case describing a myopathic syndrome related to potassium deficiency (potassium level 1.7 mmol/L) in a patienttaking furosemide 80 mg daily and with a history of laxative abuse (laxatives not named). However, even this case may not haveoccurred as a result of an interaction as the patient also hadgastroenteritis, causing profuse diarrhoea. 3 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Possible pharmacodynamic interaction involving additive loss of potassium and water by anthraquinone-containing substances andpotassium-depleting diuretics. Importance and management This is a theoretical interaction, but be aware of the potential for hypokalaemia in patients who are taking potassium-depletingdiuretics and who regularly use, or abuse, anthraquinone-containingsubstances such as aloes. However, note that, if anthraquinonelaxatives are used as recommended (at a dose producing acomfortable soft-formed motion), then this interaction is not clinically relevant.

Use and indications Used in Ayurvedic medicine particularly for jaundice as ageneral liver and digestive system tonic, and as an immune system stimulant for treatment and prevention of infections.It is also used as an anti-inflammatory and antimalarial, and for cardiovascular disorders and diabetes. When used for the common cold, it is commonly combined with Eleuther- ococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng), page 219, or echinacea, page 167.Pharmacokinetics Evidence from animal studies suggests that crude extracts of andrographis might induce the cytochrome P450 isoenzymesCYP1A and CYP2B, 1and might moderately inhibit P-glycoprotein.2However, there is no certainty that this evidence can be extrapolated to clinical use, and furtherstudy is required to assess its clinical application. Interactions overview Andrographis may have antidiabetic and antihypertensiveeffects, and limited evidence suggests that it may interactwith conventional drugs with these properties. Andrographismay also have antiplatelet effects, and so it may interact with conventional antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants, although evidence is sparse. 1.

Phytother Res(2006) 20, 79 -81.A 30Andrographis + Anticoagulants The interaction between andrographis and warfarin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Kan Jang (a standardised fixed combination of extracts from Andrographis paniculata andEleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng), page 219) caused a modest increase in warfarin exposure, but did not alter the effect of warfarin on prothrombin time, in astudy in rats. One group of animals was given an aqueous solution of Kan Jang orally for 5 days, at a dose of 17 mg/kg daily of theactive principle andrographolide (a dose about 17-fold higher than that recommended for humans). The control group received a similar volume of water only. Sixty minutes after the final daily dose of Kan Jang or water, an aqueous solution of warfarin was given orally, at adose of 2 mg/kg. The AUC of warfarin was increased by 67%, andits clearance was decreased by 45%, but other pharmacokineticparameters were similar. 1 Mechanism The available evidence suggests that andrographis might have antiplatelet effects (see Andrographis + Antiplatelet drugs below), which would be expected to prolong bleeding time. This mayincrease the risk or severity of bleeding if over-anticoagulation withwarfarin occurs. It is not clear why high doses of andrographisincrease warfarin exposure. Importance and management A very high dose of andrographis does not appear to directly affect prothrombin time, but may modestly increase warfarin exposure. As this study suggested that the pharmacodynamic effects of warfarinwere not altered, any pharmacokinetic interaction would not beexpected to be clinically relevant. However, if the antiplatelet effectsof andrographis are confirmed to be clinically important, then anincreased risk of bleeding would be anticipated in patients alsotaking warfarin, as occurs with low-dose aspirin. Therefore, untilmore is known, some caution is appropriate if andrographis is given in high doses for a long period of time with any anticoagulant. 1.

Andrographis + Antidiabetics The interaction between andrographis and antidiabetics is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Andrographolide1and an andrographis decoction2lowered blood- glucose levels in animal models of diabetes. In one study, the effect was similar to that of Karela ( Momordica additive pharmacological effects. Importance and management These experimental studies provide limited evidence of the possible blood-glucose-lowering properties of andrographis, but, because of the nature of the evidence, applying these results in a clinical settingis extremely difficult. However, if a patient taking antidiabetic drugswants to take andrographis it may be prudent to discuss thesepotential additive effects, and advise an increase in blood-glucose monitoring should an interaction be suspected. 1.

Andrographis + Antihypertensives Limited evidence suggests that andrographis may have hypo- tensive properties that may be additive if given with conven-tional antihypertensives. Clinical evidence Anecdotal evidence suggests that some patients have experienced hypotensive effects while taking andrographis. 1 Experimental evidence In vitro andanimal studies found that extracts of andrographis, and various individual diterpenoid constituents have hypotensive effects.1,2 Mechanism Unknown. Andrographis may have antihypertensive effects, and a slight additive reduction in blood pressure is possible if it is givenwith conventional antihypertensives. Importance and management These experimental studies provide limited evidence of the possible hypotensive properties of andrographis. Because of the nature of theevidence, applying these results to a general clinical setting isdifficult and, until more is known, it would be unwise to adviseanything other than general caution. 1.

(Apiaceae) Synonym(s) and related to be confused ). Constituents Aniseed fruit contains 2 to 6% of a volatile oil composed mostly of trans -anethole (80 to 95%), with smaller amounts of estragole (methyl chavicol), -caryophyllene and umbelliferone, numerous flavonoids quercetin, apigenin and luteolin. Use and indications Aniseed dried fruit, or oil distilled from the fruit, are usedmainly for their antispasmodic, carminative and parasiticide effects. Aniseed also is reputed to have mild oestrogenic effects, page 34. In foods, aniseed is used as a spice andflavouring. Pharmacokinetics Studies in rats suggested that trans -anethole did not altercytochrome P450 activity, but increased UDP-glucuronyl-transferase activity (a phase II biotransformation reaction). 1 In another study in rats, aniseed oil enhanced the absorption of glucose from the gut, probably by increasingthe activity of the Na+/K+ATPase and consequently the sodium gradient needed for glucose transport.2 For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids and natural coumarins present in aniseed, seeunder flavonoids, page 186 and natural coumarins, page 297, respectively. Interactions overview Evidence is very limited. Aniseed appears to have someoestrogenic effects, but the clinical relevance of this is unclear. For information on the interactions of individualflavonoids present in aniseed, see under flavonoids,page 186. Although aniseed contains natural coumarins, the quantity of these constituents is not established, and therefore the propensity of aniseed to interact with otherdrugs because of their presence is unclear. Consider naturalcoumarins, page 297, for further discussion of the inter- actions of natural coumarin-containing herbs. 1. Rompelberg CJ, Verhagen H, van Bladeren PJ.

Experimental evidence In a yeast oestrogen screen assay, the fruit oil from aniseed wasoestrogenic.1In another study, an aqueous extract from aniseed had selective oestrogen receptor modulator-like properties (i.e. properties like those of drugs such as raloxifene) in various in vitro assays (stimulation and differentiation of osteoblasts, anti-oestrogenic effecton breast cancer cells, and absence of proliferative effects oncervical adenocarcinoma cells). 2 Mechanism Active compounds from aniseed appear to have oestrogenic activity and might compete for the same oestrogen receptor as conventionalhormonal drugs and treatment. Importance and management These experimental studies provide limited evidence of the possible oestrogenic activity of aniseed. Because of the nature of theevidence, applying these results in a clinical setting is extremelydifficult and, until more is known, it would be unwise to adviseanything other than general caution. 1.

J AAristolochia Aristolochia species (Aristolochiaceae) Synonym(s) and related species The nomenclature of these and related plants has given rise to confusion with other, non-toxic plants. This has beenexacerbated by the fact that different Chinese names havebeen used for each species. Great care is needed. Birthwort has been used as a collective name for the Aristolochia species, but it has also been used for one of the species, Aristolochia clematitis L. The Chinese name Mu Tong has been used to refer to some of the Aristolochia species. Aristolochia clematitis L. and Aristolochia fangchi are the most common species used in herbal medicines, but manyothers are also used. Aristolochia fangchi has been referred to by the Chinese names Fang Chi, Fang Ji, Guang Fang Ji.However, note that Stephania tetrandra is also known as Fang Ji. Aristolochia reticulata NUTT., also known as Serpentary, Snakeroot and Texan snakeroot, has been used as a herbalmedicine, although note that the term Snakeroot has alsobeen used to describe other species.Constituents All species contain a range of toxic aristolochic acids andaristolactams. Use and indications Aristolochic acids and aristolactams are nephrotoxic, car- cinogenic and cytotoxic. Numerous deaths have resulted from aristolochic acid nephropathy and associated urothelialcancer, caused by ingestion of aristolochia both medicinally and from contamination of food. All plants of the family Aristolochiaceae are banned in Europe and elsewhere, andshould be avoided. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview No interactions with aristolochia found.A 35Arjuna Terminalia arjuna Arjun myrobalan. Terminalia cuneata Roth. Constituents The main constituents of the bark are triterpenoid saponins including arjunic acid, arjunolic acid, arjungenin and luteolin also Arjuna ( BP 2009 ). Use and indications Arjuna is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine for thetreatment of cardiovascular disorders including coronaryartery disease, heart failure, hypertension and hypercholes- terolaemia. A number of small clinical studies have supported this use. Interactions overview Arjuna appears to have some effects on cardiovascularfunction, which may lead to interactions with conventionaldrugs used for similar indications. However, if anything,these interactions may be beneficial. Arjuna may also affect thyroid function, which could alter the control of both hyper- and hypothyroidism. For information on the interactions of individual flavo- noids present in arjuna, see under flavonoids, page 186.A 36Arjuna + Cardiovascular drugs Arjuna appears to have some effects on cardiovascular function that may be of benefit when given with conventional cardiovas-cular drugs. Clinical evidence The effect of arjuna on angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, left ventricular mass and hyperlipidaemia has been investigated in anumber of small studies in patients with various cardiovascular disorders (these have been the subject of a review 1). In some of these studies, patients were also taking conventional drugs. For example, in one double-blind, crossover study in 58 patients with stableangina, the addition of powdered stem bark extract (500 mg every8 hours) for one week decreased the number of angina episodes andthe need for nitrate therapy during episodes of angina (about 5.7 mg/ week versus 18.2 mg/week with placebo).2In another double-blind crossover study in patients with refractory congestive heart failure,the addition of bark extract 500 mg every 8 hours for 2 weeks toconventional therapy ) led to improvements in signs and symptoms of heart failure. Thisimprovement was maintained over long-term evaluation in an openphase, when patients continued the bark extract at the same dosage.The only notable adverse effect was a rise in serum potassium (from about 3.8 to 4.3 mmol/L). 3Another randomised, placebo-controlled study in patients with coronary heart disease found that adding arjuna bark powder 500 mg daily to existing medication decreasedlipid peroxide levels (a marker of atherosclerosis) and caused asignificant decrease in cholesterol levels. 4 Experimental evidence Numerous pharmacological studies in animals (which have been the subject of a review1) have shown that arjuna has cardiotonic activity, positive or negative inotropic effects (depending on the type of extract), causes bradycardia, and has hypotensive effects, antioxidantactivity and lipid-lowering effects. Mechanism Unknown. Arjuna is purported to have inotropic and hypotensive effects, as well as lipid-lowering effects. These effects might be additive with those of conventional cardiovascular drugs. See Arjuna + Thyroid and Antithyroid drugs below for the possibility that someof the cardiovascular effects of arjuna might occur via an antithyroidaction. Importance and management Arjuna has been used in small numbers of patients taking a variety of conventional cardiovascular drugs, apparently without particular problems, and with possible additional benefit. 1.

Arjuna + Thyroid and Antithyroid drugs The interaction between arjuna and thyroid or antithyroid drugs is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in animals , arjuna bark extract appeared to inhibit thyroid function. Giving levothyroxine increased the level of thyroid hormones, increased the heart to body weight ratio, as well as increasing cardiac and hepatic lipid peroxidation. When the plantextract was given simultaneously, the level of thyroid hormones, and also the cardiac lipid peroxidation, were decreased. These effects were comparable to those of a standard antithyroid drug, propyl- thiouracil . When arjuna bark extract was given to euthyroid animals , thyroid hormone levels were decreased, whereas the hepatic lipid peroxidation increased, indicating drug-induced livertoxicity. 1 Mechanism Arjuna may deplete thyroid hormones. Importance and management Although the evidence is experimental, until more is known, it might be prudent to avoid the use of arjuna in patients requiringlevothyroxine (or any thyroid hormone), because of the possibilityof reduced efficacy. If patients want to try arjuna, their thyroid function should be monitored more frequently. An additive effect with antithyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil might also occur, andtherefore similar caution would seem advisable. Since, in euthyroid animals , thyroid hormones were decreased and hepatic lipid peroxidation was increased, the authors suggestthat high amounts of this plant extract should not be consumed, ashepatotoxicity as well as hypothyroidism may occur. 1 1.

Pharmazie (2006) 61, 793 -5.Arjuna 37 AArtichoke Cynara Jerusalem artichoke. Pharmacopoeias Artichoke Leaf ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Artichoke Leaf Dry Extract ( Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents Artichoke leaf is usually standardised to the caffeoylquinic acid derivative, chlorogenic acid . Other major constituents areflavonoid glycosides based side and scolymoside, and sesquiterpene lactones includingcynaropicrin. Use and indications The leaf extract has been traditionally used for liver anddigestive disorders, especially dyspepsia and nausea, and topromote bile secretion. Its use now focuses more on hypercholesterolaemia, hyperlipidaemia and irritable bowel syndrome, and some cardiovascular disorders such asatherosclerosis. Artichoke flowers are also used as food and artichoke extracts are used as flavouring agents. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present inartichoke, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview No interactions with artichoke found. For information on the interactions of individual flavonoids present in artichoke, see Devil 's dung, Gum asafetida. Asafoetida is obtained from various Ferula species, the main being Ferula asafoetida L. or foetida (Bunge) Regel. Note that (Ferula communis L.), although a species of Ferula , contains certain constituents that are distinct from asafoetida and will not be dealt with in this monograph. Constituents The gum resin contains ferulic acid esters and free ferulicacid, asaresinotannols, farnesiferols A, coumarin derivatives saradaferin, gummosin, asacoumarins present.Ferula foetida also contains foetisulfides and foetithio- phenes.Use is used for carminative, antispasmodic andexpectorant properties in chronic bronchitis, pertussis, andspecifically for intestinal flatulent colic. Pharmacokinetics Little information is available. Studies in rats fed with asafoetida suggest that, it did not stimulate levels ofcytochrome P450, and glucuronyl transferase activity remained unaffected. 1 Interactions overview In theory the use of asafoetida with conventional an- tihypertensives may be expected to produce additive hypotensive effects. Although it has been suggested that asafoetida may interact with anticoagulants, the availabledata do not appear to support this prediction. 1. Sambaiah K, Srinivasan K. Influence of spices and spice principles on hepatic mixed function oxygenase system in rats. Indian J Biochem Biophys (1989) 26, 254 -8.A 39Asafoetida + Antihypertensives The interaction between asafoetida and antihypertensives is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats, asafoetida gum extract significantly reduced mean arterial blood pressure.1 Mechanism In theory the use of asafoetida with conventional antihypertensives may be expected to produce additive hypotensive effects. Importance and management Because of the nature of the evidence, applying these results in a clinical setting is extremely difficult and, until more is known, it would be unwise to advise anything other than general caution. 1. Fatehi M, Farifteh F, Fatehi-Hassanabad Z. Antispasmodic and hypotensive effects of Ferula gum extract. J Ethnopharmacol (2004) 91, 321 -4. Asafoetida + Food No interactions found. Asafoetida + Herbal medicines No interactions found.Asafoetida + Warfarin and related drugs The interaction between asafoetida and warfarin and relateddrugs is a prediction only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Some reviews 1and monographs list asafoetida as having the potential to increase the risk of bleeding or potentiate the effects ofwarfarin . Mechanism This appears to be based on the fact that asafoetida contains natural coumarins, but these are not thought to have the structural requirements for anticoagulant activity. For more information, see Natural coumarins + Warfarin and relateddrugs, page 301. Importance and management There appears to be no evidence to support the prediction of an interaction between warfarin and asafoetida, and some data do suggest that an interaction is unlikely to occur. No special precautions therefore appear to be needed if patientstaking warfarin or related anticoagulants also wish to takeasafoetida. 1. Heck AM, DeWitt BA, Lukes AL. Potential interactions between alternative therapies and warfarin. Am J cherry. Physalis somnifera L. Note that ashwagandha has also been known as Indian ginseng, which should not be confused with the common ginsengs, page 219. Constituents The major constituents of the root are steroidal lactones, withseveral series known as the A date), glycowithanolides (sitoindosides), the withasomnifer- ols (A -C), withastramonolide and withaferin A. The extract of ashwagandha root originates in Ayurvedic medicine,and it is used as a tonic for debility and as an adaptogen andimmune modulator. It has sedative and anti-inflammatory effects and is used for a wide range of conditions including hypercholesterolaemia. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview Although ashwagandha may have blood-glucose-lowering effects, these seem to be mild, and would not generally be expected to affect the control of diabetes with conventionalmedicines. Ashwagandha may affect the reliability of digoxin assays, and interfere with the control of hypo- and hyperthyroidism.A 41Ashwagandha + Antidiabetics Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha has blood-glucose- lowering effects, which may be additive with conventionalantidiabetics. Clinical evidence In 6 subjects with mild type 2 diabetes, giving powdered root of ashwagandha 1 g three times daily after meals for 30 days reducedblood-glucose levels by 12% (from 11.5 to 10.1 mmol/L -timing of sample in relation to meals not stated). 1These subjects discontinued any blood-glucose-lowering drugs before the study, and 6 controlsubjects continued treatment with glibenclamide . These control subjects also had a reduction in blood-glucose of 12%. This study isdifficult to interpret, because there was no placebo group. Experimental evidence No interactions found. Mechanism Unknown. Additive blood-glucose-lowering effects might be antici- pated with antidiabetics. Importance and management The limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha might have blood- glucose-lowering effects. Until further information is available, if a patient taking antidiabetic drugs wants to take ashwagandha it maybe prudent to discuss these potential additive effects, and advise anincrease in blood-glucose monitoring should an interaction besuspected. However, bear in mind that, although ashwagandha hasbeen used for a wide number of complaints, it does not appear to beused for diabetes, suggesting that any effects are mild, and probablynot clinically relevant. 1.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence (a) Digoxin In a study, mice fed two ashwagandha extracts (in quantities that equated to human doses) developed apparent serum digoxin levels of 0.46 nanograms/mL and 0.57 (FPIA) ofdigoxin A detectable digoxin levels by FPIA. No digoxin wasdetected for any of the three extracts using a digoxin assay Laboratories). 1Similar findings were seen in vitro , with interference seen at lower concentrations of ashwagandha extracts with the FPIA assay, than with the MEIA and Beckman assays.1In other similar studies by the same research group, an enzyme-linked chemiluminescent not affected by ashwagandha. (b) Other drugs Inin vitro tests, ashwagandha extract had no effect withanolides (major constituents of ashwagandha) are struc- turally similar to digoxin, and might therefore interfere with thedigoxin immunoassay. 1 Importance and management The animal data available suggest that, in patients taking digoxin and ashwagandha, digoxin levels might be spuriously elevated when assayed using a fluorescence polarisation immunoassay. Further clinical study is needed. 1. Dasgupta A, Peterson A, Wells A, Actor JK.

Ashwagandha + Thyroid and Antithyroid drugs Limited evidence suggests that ashwagandha increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore interferes with the control of hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Clinical evidence A 32-year-old healthy woman developed clinical symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, and was found to have elevated levels of thyroidhormones when she increased the dose of capsules containingashwagandha herbal extract that she had been taking for chronic fatigue. The symptoms and raised thyroid hormone levels resolved on stopping the product. 142 Ashwagandha AExperimental evidence In a study in mice, ashwagandha root extract 1.4 g/kg given daily for 20 days by gastric intubation increased serum levels of thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine and thyroxine, by 18% and 111%,respectively. 2 Mechanism Unknown. Additive effects with thyroid hormones might be anticipated. Importance and management Although the evidence is limited, until more is known, it might beprudent to advise caution if patients taking levothyroxine (or other thyroid hormones) want to take ashwagandha because of the possibility of an increase in effects. Furthermore, on the basis of this evidence, ashwagandha may be expected to antagonise the effects of antithyroid drugs, such as propylthiouracil . In both cases it may be prudent to consider monitoring thyroid function tests if symptoms ofhypo- or hyperthyroidism begin to emerge. 1. van der, Hooft CS, Hoekstra A, Winter A, (2005) 149, 2637 -8. 2.

Constituents Asparagus contains saponins called asparagosides, (including kaempferol and quercetin) and various amino acids and polysaccharides. Asparagus is also a source of folic acid, vitamin K 1and other vitamins. Use and indications The root and green parts of asparagus have been used as adiuretic, laxative, cardiac tonic and sedative. The youngshoots are eaten as a foodstuff. Asparagusic acid may benematocidal. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data for asparagus found. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavo- noids present in asparagus, see flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview No interactions with asparagus found; however, note thatasparagus contains a moderate amount of vitamin K and maytherefore reduce the effectiveness of warfarin and othersimilar anticoagulants if eaten in large quantities. For information on the interactions of individual flavonoids present in asparagus, see under flavonoids, page 186.A 44Asparagus + Food No interactions found, but note that asparagus is extensively used as a foodstuff. Asparagus + Herbal medicines No interactions found.Asparagus + Warfarin and related drugs Patients taking coumarins and indanediones should avoid takingexcessive amounts of asparagus because of its vitamin K 1 content. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Asparagus1contains a moderate amount of vitamin K 1, which reduces the effect of coumarin and indanedione anticoagulants, which are vitamin K antagonists. Patients taking these an-ticoagulants are advised to maintain a regular amount of vitamin K from the diet. They should therefore avoid taking excessive amounts of asparagus. 1. USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 17. Vitamin K (phylloquinone) (g) content of selected foods per common measure. var mongholi- cus(Bunge.) ). Constituents The key constituents triterpene saponins , which include the astragalosides I -VIII acetyl derivatives, the agroastragalosides I -IV, the astramembranins I and II and others. Isoflavones are also present, mainly glycosides of calycosin and isoflavan, and a series of polysaccharidesknown as astragaloglucans. Use and indications Astragalus is traditionally used in Chinese medicine as atonic to strengthen the immune system, for viral infections, fatigue and loss of blood. It is now used as a liver protectant, an adjunct in chemotherapy and impaired immunity, and fora variety of other conditions such as cardiovascular diseaseand diabetic complications. Some indications are supported by pharmacological and clinical studies. Pharmacokinetics Few data are available, but in a study in one healthy subject, who was given astragalus root decoction orally twice daily before meals of bread and honey for 5 days, urine samples were found to contain calycosin and formononetin andvarious isoflavonoid glucuronide metabolites. These data,and data in vitro studies, demonstrate that the isoflavones in astragalus could be absorbed and metabolisedby the intestine. 1For more information about the pharma- cokinetics of isoflavones, see under isoflavones, page 258. Interactions overview Astragalus appears to alter the immune response, but the effect this has on treatment with interleukins, interferons, antiretrovirals and antineoplastics does not appear to beestablished. For information about the interactions of individual isoflavones present in astragalus, see under isoflavones, page 258. 1. Xu F, Zhang Y, Xiao S, Lu X, Yang D, Yang X, Li C, Shang M, Tu P, Cai S.

Drug Metab Dispos (2006) 34, 913 -24.A 46Astragalus + Antineoplastics Astragalus the response to chemotherapy with mitomycin, a vinca alkaloid and cisplatin in one study. Limitedexperimental data suggest that astragalus may diminish theimmunosuppressant effects of cyclophosphamide. Clinical evidence In one small randomised clinical study in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the addition of an infusion of astragalus to a chemotherapy regimen of mitomycin ,vinca alkaloid and cisplatin (MVP) improved response rate (40% versus 36.7%) and median survival (11 months versus 7 months), when compared with a control group receiving MVP alone.1 Experimental evidence In a study in cyclophosphamide -primed rats, giving a partially purified fraction of astragalus before mononuclear cell grafting markedly enhanced the ability of the rats to reject the graft. This suggests that astragalus reversed the immunosuppressant effect of cyclophosphamide .2Conversely, in a similar study, astragalus appeared to prolong the life of bone marrow cells transplantedintomice pretreated with cyclophosphamide , as well as promoting blood cell production.3Furthermore, in another study in rats, pretreatment with astragalus and Ligustrum lucidium (glossy privet) for 12 days had no effect on the degree or duration of myelosuppres-sion (neutrophil and platelet counts) seen after a single dose of cyclophosphamide .4 Mechanism Unknown, although many in vitro studies have shown that astragalus has immunostimulating effects. Importance and management The preclinical and preliminary clinical evidence suggests that astragalus might have immunomodulating activity and effects onblood cell production, and might therefore have beneficial effects ifit is given with antineoplastics. Some have interpreted the preclinicaldata showing increased rejection of a xenograft 2as suggesting that astragalus might decrease the effects of immunosuppressive therapy,and recommend caution with the combination. The evidence is extremely limited, and apparently conflicting; nevertheless it may be prudent to consider the risk -benefit ratio of using the herb, especially in those given immunosuppressant treatment for life-threatening conditions. 1.

Astragalus + Antiretrovirals Long-term astragalus use does not appear to reduce the efficacy of zidovudine or zalcitabine. Clinical evidence A randomised, placebo-controlled study, found that a combination of five Glycyrrhiza glaba L. L. (Safflower) may enhance the activity of antiretrovirals in patients with HIV . Over a period of 24 weeksantiretroviral-naive subjects received a combination of zidovudine200 mg three times daily and zalcitabine 750 micrograms three times daily plus either the combined herbs 2.5 g three times daily orplacebo. Forty patients receiving the herbs had a significantly greater decline in viral load than 20 patients receiving placebo. In addition, the CD4 cell count in the herbal group was significantly increasedfrom the baseline value from week 12 onwards. No serious adverseevents were reported in either of the two groups. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown, although many in vitro studies have shown that astragalus has immunostimulating effects. Importance and management Although not an interactions study, the findings provide some evidence that if patients take astragalus concurrently with the NRTIszidovudine or zalcitabine no major adverse interaction would beexpected, and efficacy should not be compromised. Because theherbal product used contained three different herbs, a beneficialeffect for a combination of astragalus and antiretroviral drugs is stillfar from proven. 1.

Astragalus + Cytokines Preliminary evidence suggests that astragalus may be beneficial when given with interferon-alfa or interleukin-2. Clinical evidence In a controlled study in 235 patients, astragalus appeared to act synergistically with interferon-alfa for the topical treatment of chronic cervicitis associated with viral infection. Local application of astragalus extract plus interferon was similar in efficacy to twice the dose of interferon alone, and more effective than astragalus alone.1 Experimental evidence Various in vitro studies have found that astragalus extract potentiates the cytotoxic effect of interleukin-2 against renal cell carcinoma by about tenfold.2,3 MechanismUnknown, although many in vitro studies have found that astragalus has immunostimulating effects. Importance and management The above preliminary evidence suggests that astragalus might have immunomodulating activity and might therefore be beneficial whengiven with interferons or interleukin-2. 1.

Note that Canada Balsam from the fir tree Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. is sometimes known as Balm of Gilead. Mecca balsam, a resin from Commiphora opobalsamum Engl. (Burseraceae) has also been used as a synonym for Balm ofGilead. Not to be confused with Poplar bark, which is also from Populus species. Constituents The leaf buds, collected before they open, contain phenolicglycosides including salicin (asalicylate ) and populin, and a volatile oil consisting of -caryophyllene as the major component with cineole, phenone. and others, and some Populus species may have constituents that differ slightly.Use and indications Balm of Gilead has expectorant, stimulant, antipyretic and analgesic activity, and is used mainly in cough mixtures. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found for Balm of Gilead,but note that salicin, a constituent of Balm of Gilead, ismetabolised to salicylic acid in the body.

Constituents The root bark, which is used therapeutically, contains triterpenes myricitrin.Use and indications Bayberry bark is used for coughs and colds, and for diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disorders. It is also usedtopically for wounds and as a douche for vaginal discharge. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview No Leaf ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The major active constituent or cut dried leaves may contain not less than 7% anhydrous arbutin (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 flavo- quercetin), and tannins (including corilagin) are also present. Use and indications Bearberry leaves and preparations are traditionally used for urinary tract infections. The use of arbutin and hydroquinoneas skin-whitening agents has been investigated. Pharmacokinetics After oral ingestion, arbutin is hydrolysed in the urine tohydroquinone, 1-3which has antiseptic properties, but in large doses is irritant and cytotoxic. However, it is rapidlyconjugated in the urine, mainly as hydroquinone glucuronideand hydroquinone sulfate. 2The presence of Escherichia coli in an infected urinary tract may enhance hydroquinone levels, by reversing the conjugation process and metabolis- ing them back into free, active hydroquinone.3Alkalinisationof the urine seems to be unnecessary for improving theantiseptic properties of hydroquinone or arbutin. 3 In vitro studies4,5suggest that aqueous and ethanol extracts of commercially available bearberry leaf products markedlyinhibit CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, whereas methanol extracts appear to have low-to-moderate activity against these isoenzymes. However, the effect on CYP3A4 varied greatlybetween products. 4Bearberry alcoholic extracts were also found to inhibit CYP3A4, and interfere with the activity of P-glycoprotein in vitro , causing inhibition after 1 hour of exposure and induction after 18 hours.4The clinical signifi- cance of these effects is unknown.

Bee pollen consists of flower pollen and nectar from male seed flowers, which is mixed with secretions from a worker honey bee. Note that there are products made from pollen alone, such as Cernilton (Rye grass pollen), which will not be dealt with in this monograph. Constituents The constituents of bee pollen depend to some extent on the flower species from which it has been harvested. It usuallycontains phytosterols, essential fatty acids including linoleicand alpha-linolenic acids, flavonoids and other polyphenols, minerals, and small amounts of B vitamins and vitamin C.Coumaroyl spermine and spermidine derivatives have beenisolated from Brazilian bee pollen.Use and indications Bee pollen has been taken for prostate enlargement and toreduce the risk of atherosclerosis and hypertension, and toimprove cognition. Bee pollen from Brassica campestris is widely used in China as a natural food supplement to strengthen the body 's resistance against diseases, including cancer. There is little supporting evidence for any of these uses. It should be avoided by people allergic to bee stingsand to pollen because of the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview No interactions with bee pollen found.B 57Berberine Types, sources and related compounds Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in many plants, particularly berberis, page 61, bloodroot, page 76, coptis,page 151, goldenseal, page 230, and greater celandine,page 241. Use and indications Berberine is bactericidal, amoebicidal and fungicidal. It hasbeen used for many conditions, such as amoebic dysentery and diarrhoea, inflammation and liver disease. Berberine is also said to possess some antiepileptic, uterine stimulant andhypotensive effects, and is slightly sedative. Pharmacokinetics Berberine appears to undergo significant hepatobiliaryexcretion, including metabolism by cytochrome P450. Its metabolism in rats was partially affected by a known experimental inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. 1In onein vitro study,2berberine increase levels. In other in vitro studies,3-5it showed modest inhibition of CYP3A4 activity (see ciclosporin, page 59). It also appears to inhibit CYP2D6,4,5CYP2C85and CYP2E1,5but it does not significantly inhibit CYP2C9,4,5 CYP2C19 and CYP1A2.5 Berberine also appears to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein,as the biliary excretion of berberine in the ratwas inhibited the inhibitor ciclosporin, 59, P-glycoprotein inhibitor, improved berberine absorption.1Berberine may also be a substrate of organic cation transporters, as its biliary excretion was inhibited by the organic cation transporter inhibitor quinidine. Interactions overview Although a number of studies have used conventional drugsto study berberine metabolism, data on potentially clinicallyrelevant interactions is sparse: the most significant inter- action of berberine appears to be its potential to increase ciclosporin levels. 1.

Experimental evidence The effect of berberine was investigated using two experimental anxiety models in the mouse. Berberine showed anxiolytic effects in these models at a dose of 100 mg/kg, and sedative effects at a dose of 500 mg/kg. Berberine was found to enhance the anxiolytic effects of buspirone in the elevated plus-maze test, whereas the anxiolytic effects of berberine were not affected by diazepam .1 Mechanism Berberine may have effects on brain monoamines. Importance and management The doses of berberine given in this study were extremely large, compared with those used in clinical studies in humans. Anyinteractions seem unlikely to be clinically significant. 1.

Animal studies suggest that ciclos- porin may affect the intestinal absorption and elimination ofberberine possibly by inhibiting P-glycoprotein. Clinical evidence A study in 6 kidney transplant recipients looked at the effects of berberine on the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin. The patients weretaking ciclosporin 3 mg/kg twice daily for an average of 12 daysbefore berberine 200 mg three times daily for 12 days was added.The AUC and trough blood levels of ciclosporin were increased by about 35% and 88%, respectively. The peak ciclosporin level was decreased but this was not statistically significant. 1A clinical study by the same authors in 52 stable kidney transplant recipients takingciclosporin and given berberine 200 mg three times daily for3 months found that the ciclosporin trough levels were increased byabout 24% when the berberine-treated group was compared with 52similar patients taking ciclosporin without berberine. The ciclosporinlevels in 8 patients fell after berberine was stopped. Creatinine clearance was not significantly altered, and no serious adverse effects were reported. 1 A single-dose study in healthy subjects found conflicting results. Six subjects given a single 6-mg/kg dose of ciclosporin daily foundthat berberine 300 mg twice daily, taken for 10 days before the doseof ciclosporin, had no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics ofciclosporin. However, a separate study in another 6 subjects given asingle 3-mg/kg dose of ciclosporin found that a single 300 mg dose of berberine increased the AUC of ciclosporin by 19.2%. No adverse events were reported in this study. 2 Experimental evidence A study in ratsfound that intravenous ciclosporin 20 mg/kg did not significantly affect the AUC of intravenous berberine 10 to 20 mg/kg in the blood, but ciclosporin did decrease the AUC of berberine in the liver and the bile.3Another study in rats also found that ciclosporin increased the intestinal absorption of berberine.4Mechanism The mechanism for the increase in ciclosporin levels seen in the clinical studies is unclear, although it has been suggested that it maybe due to inhibition of CYP3A by berberine. Animal studies suggest that ciclosporin may also affect the handling of berberine possibly by inhibiting P-glycoprotein, there-fore affecting its intestinal absorption and its distribution into thebile and liver. Importance and management Although the increase in ciclosporin levels is not sufficiently severe to suggest that the concurrent use of berberine should be avoided, it may make ciclosporin levels less stable. If concurrent use is undertaken, ciclosporin levels should be well monitored, and thedose of ciclosporin adjusted accordingly. 1. Wu X, Li Q, Xin H, Yu A, Zhong M.

Berberine + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Berberine + Hyoscine (Scopolamine) The interaction between berberine and hyoscine (scopolamine) isbased on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Berberine 100 and 500 mg/kg, given orally for 7 to 14 days sig- nificantly improved hyoscine-induced amnesia in rats, measured using a step-through passive avoidance task. This antiamnesic effect of berberine was completely reversed by hyoscine methobromide,implying that the antiamnesic action of berberine may be through theperipheral rather than central nervous system. 1 Mechanism The authors suggest that the mechanism may partially be through alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade by berberine, leading to an increase in the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) and a subsequent increase in glucose supply to the brain. Importance and management The experimental evidence for this interaction is very limited and there appears to be no data to suggest that berberine may improve memory or reverse the effects of drugs that affect memory, such as hysocine, in humans. This is unlikely to be a clinically significantBerberine 59 Binteraction, especially as the doses used in the study were many times those used in human studies of berberine. 1.

Clinical evidence No interactions found.Experimental evidenceAnin vitro study found that pre-treatment with berberine blocked the anticancer effects of paclitaxel in six cancer cell line cultures (oral cancer, gastric cancer and colon cancer). 1 Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management This appears to be the only published study of an antagonistic effect between berberine and paclitaxel. Further study is required toconfirm these in vitro results, and to explore their clinical relevance. 1. Lin H-L, Liu T-Y, Wu C-W, Chi C-W.

The main constituent berberine is bactericidal, amoebicidal and fungicidal. It has some antiepileptic, uterine stimulant and hypotensive effects and is slightly sedative, as are jatrorrhizine and palmatine.

Pharmacopoeias Betacarotene ( BP 2009 ,Ph 32); Beta and indications Betacarotene is a carotenoid precursor to vitamin A (retinol). It is a natural pigment found in many plants including fruit and vegetables (such as carrots) and is therefore eaten as partof a healthy diet, and is also used as a food colouring.Betacarotene supplements are usually taken for the preven- tion of vitamin A deficiency and for reducing photosensitiv- ities in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria. It is alsoused for age-related macular degeneration and has been investigated for possible use in cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention. Pharmacokinetics Betacarotene is the most studied carotenoid of the hundredsthat exist in nature. It is a fat-soluble precursor of vitamin A(retinol) and a large part of the metabolism to vitamin Atakes place in the gastrointestinal mucosa where its absorp- tion may be sensitive to changes in gastric pH, see proton pump inhibitors, page 64. This could be a contributing factorto the large interindividual variation seen in betacaroteneabsorption. As betacarotene intake increases, vitamin A production from the carotenoid is reduced. 1 Betacarotene potentiated the induction P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1 alcohol in rats;2however, it did not significantly affect CYP1A1/2. Interactions overview Orlistat reduces betacarotene absorption, heavy long-termalcohol intake may interfere with the conversion of betacarotene to vitamin A, and the desired effect ofbetacarotene supplementation may be reduced by colchicineand omeprazole. Betacarotene reduces the benefits that combined simvastatin and nicotinic acid have on cholesterol, and reduces ciclosporin levels. Combined use with colestyr-amine or probucol modestly reduces dietary betacaroteneabsorption. Clinically relevant interactions are unlikely between betacarotene and tobacco, but note that smokers are advised against taking betacarotene. For the interactionsof betacarotene with food or lycopene, see Lycopene + Food, page 280, and Lycopene + Herbal medicines; Betacarotene, page 280. 1. Patrick L.

Effect of -carotene on hepatic cytochrome P-450 in ethanol-fed Res (2001) 25, 1368 -72.B 62Betacarotene + Alcohol Heavy consumption of alcohol may interfere with the conversion of betacarotene to vitamin A. Clinical evidence In the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC), an almost 7-year-long, large, randomised, placebo-con-trolled study in men, an alcohol intake of more than 12.9 g daily by109 heavy drinkers reduced the serum concentrations of betacar- otene 20 mg daily by up to 13%. These findings were independent of dietary carotenoid intake. 1 Experimental evidence In an experimental study in baboons fed alcohol for 2 to 5 years and given 30 mg/L and then 45 mg/L doses of betacarotene ( Solatene capsules) daily for 33 days and 29 days respectively, the serum levels of betacarotene were higher in those fed alcohol than those that were not fed alcohol. When betacarotene was stopped, its clearance wasdelayed in the baboons fed alcohol. Betacarotene was also found to potentiate the hepatotoxicity of alcohol. 2 Mechanism This interaction is complex. Betacarotene and alcohol may share similar biochemical pathways; one experimental study in ratsfound of the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2E1 by alcohol. 3Alcohol also reduces the levels of vitamin A , of which betacarotene is the precursor. It has therefore been suggested that alcohol interferes with the conversion ofbetacarotene to vitamin A .4 Importance and management Information about an interaction between betacarotene and alcohol is limited, and the effects in animals and humans are conflicting. It appears that the long-term intake of alcohol causes some changes in betacarotene disposition, and it would therefore seem sensible to tryto limit alcohol intake if betacarotene supplementation is necessary. 1.

Betacarotene + Ciclosporin A study in 10 kidney transplant recipients found that anantioxidant vitamin supplement containing betacarotene mod- estly reduced ciclosporin blood levels. Clinical evidence A randomised placebo-controlled study, in 10 kidney transplant recipients taking ciclosporin, found that the addition of anantioxidant vitamin supplement for 6 months containing vitamin C500 mg, vitamin E 400 units and betacarotene 6 mg daily reduced theciclosporin blood level by 24%. An associated improvement in renal function, indicated by an increase in glomerular filtration rate of 17%, was also seen and may have been associated with reducedciclosporin levels. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown.Importance and managementThe clinical significance of this study is unclear as there appear to be no published case reports of any adverse effects due to thisinteraction. Furthermore, a decrease in ciclosporin levels of 24% isfairly modest, and other studies have found that vitamin C 1 g daily and vitamin E 300 mg daily may slightly decrease ciclosporin levels, so the potential for a clinically significant interaction withbetacarotene alone is unclear. However, until more is known itmay be prudent to consider an interaction with betacarotene if asudden or unexplained reduction in stable ciclosporin levels occurs.More study is needed, particularly with regard to the concurrent useof standard, commercially available, multivitamin preparations. blood cyclosporin A and glomerular filtration rate in renal transplant recipients. Nephrol Dial Transplant (2005) 20, 1970- 5. Betacarotene + Cimetidine An interaction between betacarotene and cimetidine is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an animal study, rats were given intragastric alcohol to induce mucosal damage. When the ratswere pretreated with betacarotene 1 mg/kg, the number of mucosal was decreased by 63%. However, when cimetidine 50 mg/kg was given with the beta-carotene, 30 minutes before the alcohol, the damaging effects of the alcohol appeared to be enhanced. 1 Mechanism The exact mechanism is unclear. Importance and management This is a relatively old study and there do not appear to be any clinical reports in the literature. Furthermore the dose of betacar- otene used is roughly 10-fold greater than the recommended daily intake of betacarotene. Therefore a clinically relevant interactionwith cimetidine seems unlikely. \u00c1, T\u00f3th G. of PGF and cimetidine on the -carotene induced cytoprotection in rats. Hung (1989) 73, 221 Betacarotene + Colchicine The desired effect of betacarotene supplementation may be reduced in those taking colchicine. Clinical evidence Divided doses of colchicine 1.9 mg to 3.9 mg daily reduced the serum levels of betacarotene 10 000 units daily (about 6 mg) in 5obese subjects. Levels returned to normal when colchicine wasstopped. 1However, in another study, long-term use of colchicine 1 mg to 2 mg daily for 3 years had no effect on the serum levels of diet-derived carotene in 12 patients with familial Mediterranean fever.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The mechanism is unclear. Colchicine causes reversible malabsorp- tion in the gastrointestinal tract by disturbing epithelial cell functionBetacarotene 63 Band inhibiting cell proliferation. It also lowered the serum levels of cholesterol in the first study. All these factors could have an effect onthe absorption of betacarotene, which largely takes place in the gastrointestinal mucosa and the distribution of which is dependent on the presence of lipoproteins. Importance and management The evidence for a possible interaction between betacarotene and colchicine is limited to two relatively old studies. While supple-mental betacarotene absorption appears to be reduced, betacaroteneingested as part of the normal diet appears to be unaffected. Based on these two findings, and the fact that there is large interindividual variation in betacarotene absorption, it is difficult to recommend aclinical course of action other than to be aware that the desired effectof betacarotene supplementation may be reduced in those takingcolchicine. 1.

Betacarotene + Lipid regulating drugs Betacarotene reduces the benefits that combined simvastatin andnicotinic acid have on HDL-cholesterol. Colestyramine andprobucol reduce the serum levels of betacarotene eaten as part ofa normal diet. Clinical evidence In a 3-year study in 146 patients with clinical coronary disease, an antioxidant regimen consisting of betacarotene 25 mg, vitamin E800 units, vitamin C 1 g and selenium 100 micrograms daily halvedthe beneficial rise of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL2)caused by combined treatment with simvastatin 10 to 20 mg and nicotinic acid (niacin ) 2 to 4 g daily.1 There do not appear to be any studies on the effect of lipid regulating drugs on the absorption of betacarotene from supple-ments; however, a 3-year study of 303 hypercholesterolemic subjectsgiven colestyramine in doses of 8 g to 16 g daily, according to tolerance, found that the serum levels of dietary -derived betacar- otene were reduced by about 40% after 2 months. Probucol 500 mg twice daily was then added, and 2 months later the serum levels ofbetacarotene were reduced by an additional 39% (representing an overall decrease of 65%). 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Betacarotene is a fat-soluble substance, and therefore its absorption and distribution are dependent on the presence of lipoproteins, which might be reduced by colestyramine.Importance and management There appears to be only one study investigating the effects of betacarotene on treatment with lipid lowering drugs; however, thestudy was well designed, long term, and large. Antioxidantsupplementation including betacarotene appears to suppress the beneficial effects of the combined treatment of simvastatin and nicotinic acid on high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, higher levelsof which reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events. The authorssuggest that their results indicate that the use of antioxidants toprevent cardiovascular events should be questioned. What thismeans for patients taking lower therapeutic doses of betacarotene(recommended daily intake is about 6 mg daily, about one-quarter of the dose used in the study) is unclear. However, there is potential for a severe detrimental effect on concurrent use. Therefore, until moreis known it would seem prudent to avoid concurrent use, unless thereis a clear defined clinical need for betacarotene supplementation. The use of colestyramine and probucol appears to lower betacarotene levels, but the clinical importance of this does notappear to have been established. 1.

Elinder LS, H\u00e5dell K, Johansson I, Olsson AG, the absorption of supplemental betacarotene. Clinical evidence A randomised study in healthy subjects found that about two-thirds of a supplemental dose of betacarotene was absorbed in the presenceof orlistat. The study included 48 patients in 4 groups, given placebo,or betacarotene in doses of 30 mg, 60 mg or 120 mg. Thebetacarotene was given within about 30 minutes of the orlistat. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Orlistat reduces dietary fat absorption by inhibiting gastrointestinal lipase. Consequently, it reduces the absorption of fat-solublevitamins. Importance and management Evidence is limited to one study, but what is known suggests that orlistat decreases the absorption of supplemental betacarotene. Tomaximise vitamin absorption, the manufacturers recommend thatany multivitamin preparations should be taken at least 2 hours beforeor after orlistat, such as at bedtime. 2,3The US manufacturers suggest that patients taking orlistat should be advised to take multivitamins,because of the possibility of reduced vitamin levels. 3 1.

Betacarotene + Proton pump inhibitors The desired effect of betacarotene supplementation may bereduced in those taking proton pump inhibitors.64 Betacarotene BClinical evidence In a study in 10 healthy subjects the AUC of a single 120-mg dose of betacarotene was halved by pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 7 days.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The exact mechanism is unclear. Betacarotene is absorbed in the small intestine by a simple passive-diffusion process. It has beensuggested that omeprazole may retard this diffusion, 1and that delayed gastric emptying may also contribute.2 Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between betacarotene and omeprazole is limited, and as there is large interindividual variability inbetacarotene absorption, the true bioavailability of the carotenoidcan vary greatly even before omeprazole is taken. Coupled with thefact that betacarotene is a normal part of the healthy diet, it is very difficult to assess the true clinical importance of this interaction. Be aware that the desired effect of betacarotene supplements may bereduced or abolished by the concurrent use of omeprazole. If thesuggested mechanism is correct, other proton pump inhibitors arelikely to affect betacarotene absorption similarly. 1. Tang G, Serfaty-Lacrosniere C, Ermelinda Camilo M, Russell RM.

Betacarotene + Tobacco There is a slight increased risk of lung cancer in smokers takingbetacarotene supplements.Clinical evidence In the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC), an almost 7-year-long, large, randomised, placebo-con-trolled study in men, tobacco smoking did not significantly affect theserum concentrations of betacarotene 20 mg daily. These findings were independent of dietary carotenoid intake. 1However, in this study, the risk of lung cancer was slightly, but significantly, increased in those patients receiving betacarotene supplements (18%increase). 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between tobacco smoking and betacarotene is limited, but a clinically significant effect of tobaccosmoking on absorption of betacarotene supplementation seemsunlikely. However, unexpectedly, well-designed studies have founda slight increased risk of lung cancer in smokers taking betacarotene supplements. There is no clear explanation for this, and there is much debate about whether this is a true effect. Until more is knownit may be prudent for smokers to avoid betacarotene supplements,and to counsel the patient on smoking cessation and the healthbenefits of consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables daily aspart of a balanced diet. Note that the Food Standards Agency in theUK advises people who smoke not to take betacarotene supplementsbecause of an increased risk of lung cancer. 3 1.

Food that the has also been used, but the name Blueberry is the more commonly accepted name for the North American native plants such as Vaccinium angustifolium 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Fresh Bilberry ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Fresh Bilberry Fruit Dry Extract, Refined and Standardised (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Powdered Bilberry Extract ( USP 32 ). Constituents of anthocyanins , expressed as cyanidin-3-glucoside chloride (dried drug), or not less than 1% tannins, expressed aspyrogallol (dried drug), are often used ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4). Bilberry berries also contain flavonoids (including catechins, quercetin-3-glucuronide and hyperoside), and vitamin C. Use and indications Traditionally bilberry has been used to treat diarrhoea, haemorrhoids and venous insufficiency, gastrointestinalinflammation and urinary complaints. It has now found amore specific use in improving visual acuity, by improvingblood flow to the retina, and for its vasoprotective properties as an anti-atherosclerotic. Pharmacokinetics For general information about the pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins, see under flavonoids, page 186. Anin vitro study investigated the effects of bilberry extract (at a concentration likely to be attainable in thehuman intestine) on the uptake of estrone-3-sulfate by thetransporter protein OATP-B. Estrone-3-sulfate was used as it is known to be an OATP-B substrate. The bilberry extract inhibited estrone-3-sulfate uptake by about 75%, which wasconsidered to be a potent effect. 1OATP-B is known to have a role in the absorption of drugs such as fexofenadine, glibenclamide and pravastatin, and therefore this study suggests that bilberry extract may decrease the absorption ofthese drugs, which could result in a reduction in their effects. However, no clinical reports of an interaction between bilberry and these or other drugs appear to have beenpublished. Interactions overview No interactions with bilberry found.

Constituents Bitter bergamottin and bergapten). The volatile oil is mostly composed of limonene. Some sources standardise theflowers to flavonoid content, expressed as naringin, and the peel to essential oil content. Use and indications Bitter orange is traditionally used as a carminative and forother digestive disorders. It is also said to possess antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antibac- terial properties. Bitter-orange extract is included in someherbal anorectic preparations as it contains oxedrine, which is claimed to increase metabolism; however, cardiovascular adverse effects are associated with this constituent (see underCaffeine + Herbal medicines; Bitter orange, page 101).Interestingly bitter orange has also been promoted as an appetite stimulant. The flowers have been used as a sedative, and the peel and the oils are used widely as flavourings infoods and conventional medicines. Bitter orange is used tomake marmalade. The juice of bitter orange has been used in studies of drug metabolism as a comparator to grapefruit juice, but it is not used as a medicine or beverage. Pharmacokinetics A bitter orange supplement (containing oxedrine but no6,7-dihydroxybergamottin) did not inhibit the cytochromeP450 isoenzymes CYP1A2 (see caffeine, page 101), CYP2E1 (see chlorzoxazone, page 69) or CYP2D6 (as assessed with debrisoquine 1) in clinical studies.The effects of bitter orange on CYP3A4 are uncertain. A bitter orange supplement (containing oxedrine but no 6,7-dihydroxybergamottin) did not inhibit CYP3A4 (see midazolam, page 70). However, the juice of bitter orange(containing the furanocoumarins bergapten and 6,7-dihy- droxybergamottin) inhibited intestinal CYP3A4 (see felodi- pine, page 70), but probably has no effect on hepaticCYP3A4 (see indinavir, page 70). The juice may also inhibitP-glycoprotein transport (see dextromethorphan, page 69). Differences in active constituents might be part of the explanation for the differences in effects seen on CYP3A4. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in bitter orange, see flavonoids, page 186, and for the pharmacokinetics of individual furanocoumarins, see under natural coumarins, page 297. Interactions overview The juice of bitter orange has been used in some druginteraction studies (as a comparator to grapefruit juice,page 235). Information from these studies has been included here, but note that it should not be directly extrapolated to herbal medicines containing bitter orange, because somedifferences in interaction potential have been seen. A bitter orange decoction increased ciclosporin levels in animals, whereas the juice of bitter orange does not appear tointeract clinically. A bitter orange supplement does notappear to affect the pharmacokinetics of chlorzoxazone,debrisoquine or midazolam, suggesting a lack of the P450 isoenzymes CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively. The juiceof bitter orange does not appear to affect the pharmaco-kinetics of indinavir, but it may raise dextromethorphan and felodipine levels.

In vivo assessment of botanical supplementation 428 -40.B 68Bitter orange + Chlorzoxazone A bitter orange supplement did not alter the metabolism of chlorzoxazone in one study and is therefore unlikely to alter thepharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolised by CYP2E1. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, a bitter orange supplement, standardised to synephrine 4%, was given at a dose of 350 mg twicedaily for 28 days with a single 250-mg dose of chlorzoxazone given before and at the end of the treatment with bitter orange. The metabolism of chlorzoxazone was not affected by the concurrent useof bitter orange.The supplement was analysed and found to containthe stated amount of synephrine (equivalent to a daily dose of about30 mg), and none of the furanocoumarin, 6,7-dihydrobergamottin. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism No mechanism expected. Importance and management Chlorzoxazone is used as a probe drug for CYP1E2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter- action between this bitter orange supplement and other CYP1E2 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Bitter orange + Ciclosporin Bitter orange juice does not appear to affect the pharmaco- kinetics of ciclosporin in humans. However, a bitter orange decoction increased ciclosporin levels in animals . Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study, 7 healthy subjects were given a single 7.5-mg/kg dose of ciclosporin 30 minutes after consumingabout 240 mL of bitter orange juice. Bitter orange juice did not affect the AUC or the maximum serum levels of ciclosporin, although it appeared to delay the absorption of ciclosporin in some subjects.This was in contrast to the effects of grapefruit juice. 1The bitter orange juice was prepared by squeezing fresh fruit and freezing ituntil needed (up to 6 weeks). It was determined to contain6,7-dihydroxybergamottin at a concentration of about 30 micro-mol/L. Experimental evidence In a study in pigs, 200 mL of a decoction of bitter orange increased the maximum levels and AUC of ciclosporin 10 mg/kg by 64% and 46%, respectively. One of the 5 animals used in the study developed ciclosporin toxicity. The decoction was prepared by boiling thecrude drug with water for about 2 hours. Each 200 mL dose wasprepared from the equivalent of 20 g of crude drug, and wasdetermined to contain 1.12 mmoL of flavonoids, mostly naringin. It was not assayed for furanocoumarin content. 2 Mechanism The results of an animal study2suggested that bitter orange alters the absorption of ciclosporin, possibly by affecting intestinal P-glycoprotein. It is possible that the differing findings in humansrepresent differing absorption characteristics between species, but it also seems likely that they could be related to the different preparations of bitter orange (juice and a decoction) used in thestudies. Note that, in the clinical study, the furanocoumarin6,7-dihydroxybergamottin did not interact. 1In the animal study, the extent of the interaction was not related to the flavonoid content.2 Importance and management There only appear to be two studies investigating an interaction between bitter orange and ciclosporin, one of them using the juice inhumans and another using a decoction in animals. What is known suggests that the juice of bitter orange is unlikely to affect thepharmacokinetics of ciclosporin. However, the animal study suggests that a decoction of bitter orange may increase ciclosporin levels and therefore some caution may be warranted if patients taking ciclosporin wish to take bitter orange supplements. Carefulconsideration should be given to the risks of using the supplement;in patients receiving ciclosporin for severe indications, such astransplantation, it seems unlikely that the benefits will outweigh therisks. If concurrent use is undertaken then close monitoring ofciclosporin levels seems warranted. 1.

Bitter orange + Dextromethorphan Bitter orange juice increases the absorption of dextromethor- phan. Clinical evidence In a study, 11 healthy subjects were given a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan hydrobromide at bedtime, followed by 200 mL ofwater or freshly squeezed bitter orange juice. Measurement of theamount of dextromethorphan and its metabolites in the urine indicated that the bioavailability of dextromethorphan was increased by more than fourfold by bitter orange juice. Dextromethorphanlevels were still raised 3 days later, indicating a sustained effect ofthe juice. The effects were similar to those of grapefruit juice. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It was suggested that these fruit juices increased the absorption of dextromethorphan by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP3A and P-glycoprotein in the gut wall, although the authorsnote that other transporter proteins may be involved. Note thatdextromethorphan is commonly used as a probe substrate forCYP2D6; however, in this study, analysis of the metabolites demonstrated that the metabolism of dextromethorphan by CYP2D6 in the liver was not affected. 1Similarly, a bitter orange supplement did not alter CYP2D6 activity as assessed bydebrisoquine metabolism. 2 Importance and management While the study discussed shows a clear pharmacokinetic inter- action, it has no direct clinical relevance to bitter orange supple- ments (it was used in the study as a comparator to assess the likely mechanisms of the effect of grapefruit juice). How the effects of the juice of bitter orange relate to the peel of bitter orange, which is oneof the parts used medicinally, is unclear. However, note that theeffects of grapefruit juice are thought to be in part related to 'contamination 'with constituents of the peel, so some interaction might occur. Further study is needed. Note that it is important not to extrapolate the interaction seen with the juice to other CYP2D6 substrates since inhibition ofCYP2D6 was not thought to be the mechanism. 1.

Bitter orange + Felodipine Bitter orange juice increased the exposure to felodipine in one study. Clinical evidence In a randomised study, 10 healthy subjects were given a single 10-mg dose of felodipine with 240 mL of bitter orange juice ororange juice (as a control). The AUC and maximum serum levels offelodipine were increased by 76% and 61%, respectively, whencompared with orange juice. The effects were similar in magnitude to those of grapefruit juice. 1The bitter orange juice was prepared by squeezing fresh fruit and freezing it until needed. It was analysed and found to contain the furanocoumarins bergapten, 6,7-dihydro-bergamottin and bergamottin. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It was suggested that bitter orange juice inhibited the metabolism of felodipine (a drug that undergoes high first-pass metabolism) by thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 in the intestine. This issimilar to the effect seen with grapefruit juice, for which thefuranocoumarins are known to be required for an interaction tooccur. Importance and management There appears to be only one study investigating the effect of bitter orange on the pharmacokinetics of felodipine, and it relates to thejuice, so has no direct clinical relevance to bitter orange supplements.The effects seen in the study were similar, although slightly smaller,than those seen with grapefruit juice. Felodipine should not be given with the juice or peel of grapefruit juice because of the increased effects on blood pressure that may result, and some extend this adviceto other grapefruit products. See Grapefruit + Calcium-channelblockers, page 237. Extrapolating these suggestions to bitter orangeimplies that it may be prudent to be cautious if patients takingfelodipine wish to take bitter orange products made from the peel.Conversely, a bitter orange supplement did not alter the metabolismof midazolam, see below, by CYP3A4, so it is by no means clear thatthe effects of the juice can be extrapolated to the herbal products. 1.

Clin Pharmacol Ther (2001) 69, 14 -23. Bitter orange + Food No interactions found. Note that bitter orange is commonly used as a flavouring, and in marmalade, but this is not expected to result in ahigh dietary intake. Bitter orange + Herbal medicines; Caffeine- containing For an interaction between bitter orange and the caffeine content ofsome herbs resulting in adverse cardiac effects, see Caffeine + Herbal medicines; Bitter orange, page 101. Bitter orange + Indinavir Bitter orange juice did not alter indinavir pharmacokinetics inone study. Clinical evidence In a study in 13 healthy subjects, about 200 mL of freshly squeezed bitter orange juice had no effect on the pharmacokinetics ofindinavir. In this study indinavir 800 mg was given every 8 hours for4 doses; with water or bitter orange juice given with the last 2doses. Grapefruit juice also had no effect. 1The juices were determined to contain 6,7-dihydroxybergamottin at a concentration of about 40 micromol/L.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism No mechanism expected. The authors suggest that bitter orange juice does not affect the metabolism of indinavir by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 in the intestine, as has been seen with other drugs. See felodipine, above. This may be because the first-passmetabolism of indinavir is low. Importance and management Evidence regarding an interaction between indinavir and bitter orange comes from one study, which used the juice rather than thepeel or flowers of bitter orange, which are the parts used medicinally. However, this information, and what is known about midazolam, see below, suggests that bitter orange supplements are unlikely to affectthe metabolism of indinavir. 1. Penzak SR, Acosta EP, Turner M, Edwards DJ, Hon YY, Desai HD, Jann MW. Effect of Seville orange juice and grapefruit juice on indinavir pharmacokinetics. J Clin Pharmacol (2002) 42, 1165 -70. Bitter orange + Midazolam A bitter orange supplement did not alter the metabolism ofmidazolam in one study. Clinical evidence In a study 1in 12 healthy subjects, bitter orange ( Citrus aurantium ) 350 mg, standardised to 4% synephrine, was given twice daily for 28 days with a single 8-mg oral dose of midazolam before and at theend of this period. The metabolism of midazolam was not affected by the concurrent use of bitter orange. The supplement was analysed and found to contain the stated amount of synephrine (equivalent toa daily dose of about 30 mg), and none of the furanocoumarin,6,7-dihydroxybergamottin. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism No mechanism expected. The bitter orange supplement used here may not have interacted because of a lack of furanocoumarins. 1In the study here, the bitter orange supplement used did not contain theone furanocoumarin tested for, 6,7-dihydroxybergamottin. Importance and management Direct evidence about an interaction between midazolam and bitter orange appears to be limited to one clinical study.70 Bitter orange BHowever, its findings suggest that this bitter orange supple- ment is unlikely to affect the metabolism of midazolam.Midazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacoki- netic interaction between bitter orange supplements and othersubstrates of CYP3A4 is unlikely. Bearing in mind theproposed mechanisms, it is possible that this applies only tosupplements that do not contain furanocoumarins. 1. Gurley BJ, Gardner SF, Hubbard MA, Williams DK, Gentry WB, Carrier J, Khan IA, Edwards DJ, Shah A. In vivo assessment of botanical supplementation on cohosh extract ( USP Constituents The main active constituents are triterpene glycosides (to which it may be standardised) including actein, and severalseries of related compounds such as the cimicifugosides, thecimiracemosides, cimigenol and its derivatives, 26-deox- yactein and many Phenylpropanoid esters such as the cimiracemates A -D, isoferulic and ferulic acids, and methylcaffeate are present, as are the quinolizidine alkaloidsincluding cytisine and N-methylcytisine. The presence of the oestrogenic isoflavone formononetin is disputed. Use and indications Black cohosh is widely used to treat peri- and postmeno- pausal symptoms. It is also used as an antirheumatic, antitussive and sedative, and for the treatment of dysmenor-rhoea and premenstrual disorders. Pharmacokinetics Anin vitro study activity against the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP3A4 from a powdered preparation of black cohosh. However, the CYP3A4-inhibitory activity of these com- pounds was very weak, 1and the clinical data using midazolam, page 74, as a probe drug for CYP3A4 suggests that this activity is not clinically relevant. Similarly, two clinical studies using debrisoquine as a probe substrate ofCYP2D6 suggested that black cohosh (standardised to 0.2%or 2.5% triterpene has on this isoenzyme. 2,3 Black cohosh root extract had no clinically relevant effects on the activity of CYP1A2 or CYP2E1, see caffeine, page 73, and chlorzoxazone, page 73, respectively. Studies with digoxin, page 73, suggest that black cohosh does not affect P-glycoprotein activity. Interactions overview Black cohosh does not appear to interact with caffeine, chlorzoxazone, digoxin or midazolam. Limited data suggest that black cohosh may antagonise the activity of cisplatin.For a case report describing transplant rejection in a patienttaking a supplement containing alfalfa and black cohosh, see Alfalfa + Immunosuppressants, page 22. 1.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study using mouse mammary tumour cells found that liquid extracts of black cohosh caused a small reduction in the cytotoxicity of cisplatin . The extracts were standardised to 3% triterpene glycosides and were given in doses of 100 times theexpected human dose. 1 Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Evidence is extremely limited. These data cannot reasonably be extrapolated to patients being treated with an antineoplastic regimenfor breast cancer, because the dose of black cohosh used was muchhigher than the usual human dose, and the same study found thatblack cohosh may have potentiated the effects of other antineoplas- tics (such as docetaxel anddoxorubicin ). Probably of more clinical relevance are the potential oestrogenic effects of black cohosh. Although these effects are not fullyunderstood, they may have an important impact on the outcome oftreatment for oestrogen-dependent breast cancer (see also Oestro-gens or Oestrogen antagonists, page 74). 1.

Black cohosh + Caffeine Black cohosh does not significantly affect the pharmacokineticsof caffeine. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, black cohosh root extract 1.09 g twice daily (standardised to 0.2% triterpene glycosides) for 28 days did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of caffeine 100 mg. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism These studies investigated whether black cohosh had any effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 by which caffeine ismetabolised. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study, which suggests that black cohosh does not raise caffeine levels. Caffeine is used as a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between black cohosh and other CYP1A2 substrates isunlikely. 1. Gurley BJ, Gardner SF, Hubbard MA, Williams DK, Gentry WB, Khan IA, Shah A. In vivo effects of goldenseal, kava cohosh does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of chlorzoxazone.

Mechanism These studies investigated whether black cohosh had any effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1 by which chlorzoxazone is metabolised. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study, which suggests that black cohosh does not raise chlorzoxazone levels. Chlorzoxazone is used as a probe drug for CYP2E1 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between black cohosh and other CYP2E1 substrates is unlikely. 1.

There were no significant changes in thepharmacokinetics of digoxin, and no serious adverse effects werereported. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Digoxin is used as a probe drug to assess the effects of other substances on P-glycoprotein. Importance and management This study suggests that black cohosh does not interact with digoxin, and is unlikely to interact with other drugs that are transported byP-glycoprotein. 1.

Black cohosh + Midazolam Black cohosh does not affect the pharmacokinetics of mid-azolam. Clinical evidence In a study in 19 healthy subjects given black cohosh extract (standardised to triterpene glycosides 2.5%) 40 mg twice daily for28 days with a single 8-mg oral dose of midazolam on day 28, there was no change in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam . In addition, black cohosh had no effect on the duration of midazolam -induced sleep.1Similarly, in another study in 12 non-smoking healthy subjects given black cohosh root extract (standardised to triterpeneglycosides 0.2%) 1090 mg twice daily for 28 days, there was no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of a single 8-mg oral dose of midazolam .2Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism These studies investigated whether black cohosh had any effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 by which midazolam is metabolised. Importance and management Black cohosh is unlikely to interact with midazolam and, as midazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, blackcohosh is also unlikely to induce or inhibit the metabolism of other CYP3A4 substrates. 1.

They also contain natural coumarins , such as scopoletin and aesculetin, and triterpenes , including oleanolic and ursolic acids. Use and indications Traditionally black haw has been used as a uterine tonic, for preventing miscarriage in the latter stages of pregnancy, to reduce pain and bleeding after childbirth, and for dysmenor- rhoea.Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. For information onthe pharmacokinetics of individual natural coumarins presentin black haw, see under coumarins, page 297. Interactions overview No interactions with black haw found.

Some have suggestedthat bogbean may interact with anticoagulants, presumablybased on its natural coumarin content, but the coumarins present are not known to possess the structural requirements necessary for anticoagulant activity. For more information,see Natural coumarins + Warfarin and related drugs, page 301. For information on the interactions of individual flavonoids present in bogbean, BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Boldo Leaf Dry Extract (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents Alkaloids are the main constituents of boldo leaf and these include boldine , isoboldine and dehydroboldine among others. Extracts may be standardised to contain a minimumof 0.1% of total alkaloids (dried extracts), or 0.5% of total alkaloids (aqueous extracts), expressed as boldine (BP 2009 , Ph Eur 6.4 ). Boldo also contains coumarin . Volatile oils present include low levels of ascaridole, which is toxic: it isthis constituent that has led to the suggestion that the dose and duration of treatment with boldo should be restricted. Use and indications Boldo is used as an aid to slimming, although there is little orno evidence to support this use. It is also traditionally usedfor dyspepsia, digestive disturbances, constipation, gall-stones, liver disorders, cystitis and rheumatism. Recent research has shown boldine to be a potent antioxidant. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview There are few data regarding boldo. One case report suggests that it may interact with warfarin.B 78Boldo + Food No interactions found. Boldo + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Boldo + Warfarin and related drugs A report describes a woman taking warfarin whose INR rose modestly when she began to take boldo and fenugreek. Clinical evidence A woman taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation whose INR was normally within the range 2 to 3 had a modest rise in her INR to 3.4, apparently due to the use of 10 drops of boldo after meals and one capsule of fenugreek before meals. A week after stopping these two herbal medicines her INR had fallen to 2.6. When she restarted them,her INR rose to 3.1 after a week, and to 3.4 after 2 weeks. Her INRwas later restabilised in her normal range, while continuing to takethese two herbs, by reducing the warfarin dosage by 15%.1The patient had no undesirable reactions (e.g. bruising or bleeding). Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The mechanism of this apparent interaction remains unknown, and it is not known whether both herbs or just one was responsible forwhat happened. Both boldo and fenugreek have been reported tocontain natural coumarins, but it is unclear whether they have anyanticoagulant activity. See natural coumarins, page 297 for moreinformation on the interactions of coumarin-containing herbs. Importance and management Evidence is limited to one isolated case. Because of the many other factors influencing anticoagulant control, it is not possible to reliablyascribe a change in INR specifically to a drug interaction in a singlecase report without other supporting evidence. It may be better to advise patients to discuss the use of any herbal products that they wish to try, and to increase monitoring if this is thought advisable.Cases of uneventful use should be reported, as they are as useful aspossible cases of adverse effects. 1.

For information on the interactions of individual flavonoids present in boneset, gum resin obtained from Boswellia serrata is known as Indian frankincense, Indian olibanum or Salai guggul. Not to be confused with other types of frankincense, which are extracted from other Boswellia species and used for their aromatic properties. Pharmacopoeias Indian Frankincense ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The main active constituents are the boswellic acids , which boswellic acid, are thought to be particularly potentanti-inflammatory agents. The volatile oils of Boswellia serrata characteristically contain the diterpenes isoincensole and isoincensole acetate. Use and indications Boswellia serrata is used for inflammatory disorders including collagenous colitis (a cause of chronic diarrhoea),peritumoral oedema, rheumatoid arthritis and other chronicconditions. There is mounting clinical evidence to support its use. The boswellic acids have immunomodulatory effects and are anti-inflammatory via a number of mechanisms. Pharmacokinetics In an in vitro study, aqueous extracts of Boswellia serrata did not inhibit common cytochrome P450 drug-metabolisingenzymes. However, the gum resin was found to have someinhibitory effects on the cytochrome P450 isoenzymesCYP1A2 and CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, although the clinical relevance of these effects is not clear. It wasestablished that cytochrome P450 inhibition occurs irre- spective of boswellic acid content, and the constituents responsible for this effect are not removed during themanufacturing of a commercially available product tested inthe study (Boswellia serrata extract, H15). 1Another in vitro study that derivatives of boswellic acids (from aBoswellia serrata extract, H15) inhibited P-glycoprotein in a dose-dependent manner. It was suggested that the lowbioavailability of some of the boswellic acid derivatives means that boswellia is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on P-glycoprotein at the blood- brain barrier, but that it may inhibit gastrointestinal P-glycoproteinat clinically relevant doses. 2 Interactions overview Some evidence suggests that food may beneficially increase the bioavailability of boswellic acids, but other interaction data are generally lacking. It seems possible that boswelliamay interact with conventional drugs by inhibiting P-glycoprotein and/or cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (see Pharmacokinetics, above), but the data are too sparse tomake any meaningful predictions. 1.

Boswellia + Food Food appears to beneficially increase the bioavailibility of boswellic acids. Clinical evidence In a crossover study, 12 healthy subjects, after fasting for 10 hours, were given a single 786-mg dose of dry extract (gum resin) ofBoswellia serrata (standardised to 55% boswellic acids) with a high- fat meal. The plasma AUCs of the boswellic acids were increased bybetween about 1.8- and 5-fold by the high-fat meal, and themaximum plasma levels were increased by up to 6-fold. No seriousadverse events were noted. 1Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management These data show that food intake can significantly increase the bioavailability of boswellic acids, and suggest that Boswellia serrata extracts should be taken with meals, as therapeutic levels may not beachieved when taken on an empty stomach. 1.

The most common type is stem bromelain, which is extracted from the stem of the pineapple. Use and indications There is some clinical evidence for anti-arthritic andanti-inflammatory effects of bromelain, and it is sometimesused as an alternative to NSAIDs. It is also used to treatbruising, swollen and painful joints, as an analgesic and wound-healing agent, and as a skin debrider for the treatment of burns. It possesses anti-oedematous, antithrombotic,fibrinolytic and immunomodulatory activities. It also has in vivo antitumoral activity. Bromelain can cause allergies in susceptible individuals. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview Although bromelain appears to increase the levels of someantibacterials, the clinical relevance of this is unknown.B 83Bromelain + Amoxicillin Bromelain appears to moderately increase amoxicillin levels. Clinical evidence In a placebo-controlled study, subjects undergoing surgery were given a single 500-mg dose of amoxicillin and a single 80-mg doseof bromelain 3 hours before surgery. When compared with placebo,bromelain appeared to increase intra-operative amoxicillin levels intissue, serum and skin samples. Amoxicillin levels were still higher in the bromelain group 3 hours after surgery. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The reason for this interaction is unclear, but it is possible that bromelain increases the uptake of amoxicillin into tissues. Importance and management The clinical relevance of these increased levels is unclear, but as the increases were only moderate (serum concentration increased by62%) it seems likely to be small. 1.

Bromelain + Food No interactions found.Bromelain + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Bromelain + Tetracycline Bromelain appears to moderately increase tetracycline levels. Clinical evidence In a crossover study, 10 subjects were given tetracycline 500 mg, either alone or with bromelain 80 mg. Bromelain appeared to increase the serum levels of tetracycline by up to about fourfold. Higher serum and urine levels were also found when the study wasrepeated using multiple doses of the two preparations. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management The clinical significance of this interaction is unclear but higher levels of tetracycline may result in an improved outcome, and alsoan increased risk of adverse effects. 1.

(Apiaceae) Synonym(s) 's ear, chinense DC., Bupleurum ally, but Bupleurum longiradiatum Turcz. is toxic and should be avoided. Constituents Bupleurum root contains a range of triterpene saponins, the saikosaponins saikogenins. There are also polysacchar- ides known as bupleurans and phytosterols present. Use and indications Bupleurum is used for chills, fevers, as an anti-inflammatory and general tonic. It is also used for liver disorders and menstrual and uterine problems. Anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities have been demonstrated inlaboratory tests. Bupleurum root is an ingredient of a number of traditional Chinese and Japanese herbal medicines such as Sho-saiko-to (Xiao Chai Hu Tang) and Sairei-to, see thetable Constituents of some Chinese herbal medicinescontaining bupleurum opposite. These Chinese medicines are used for similar reasons to bupleurum. Pharmacokinetics Saikosaponin a, and its monoglycoside and aglycones, were detectable in the plasma of ratswhen saikosaponin a was given orally. Absorption of other derivatives, structural isomers andtheir monoglycosides and aglycones, which were formed in thegastrointestinal tract, depended on food intake. The pharma- cological effects of saikosaponin a given orally may therefore differ depending on conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. 1 Saikosaponins a, c and d are metabolised extensively in themouse gut to at least 27 metabolites in a complex manner. A study in rats to determine which of these metabolites are active, based on their corticosterone-secret-ing activity, found that saikosaponin a, saikosaponin d andtheir intestinal metabolites prosaikogenin F and prosaiko- genin G showed strong activity. Other compounds and metabolites showed varying degrees of biological activity sothe degree to which metabolism occurs is likely to affectpharmacological and clinical effects. 2 Interactions overview No interactions with bupleurum alone found. Bupleurum isthe main constituent of a number of Chinese herbal medicines, such as sho-saiko-to, saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to and sairei-to. Sho-saiko-to slightly inhibits caffeine metab-olism. sairei-to appears to alter thepharmacokinetics of ofloxacin. Sho-saiko-to may modestly affect the absorption of tolbutamide but blood-glucose levels appear to be minimally affected.1. Ogihara Y .

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study, 26 healthy subjects were given sho-saiko-to 2.5 g twice daily for 5 days, with a single 150-mg dose of caffeine on days 1 and 5. By assessing the metabolites of caffeine, it was estimated that sho- saiko-to 16% CYP1A2.1 Note that sho-saiko-to is a Chinese herbal medicine of which bupleurum is one of 7 constituents. Any modest effect is thereforenot directly attributable to bupleurum alone. See the table Constitu-ents of some Chinese herbal medicines containing bupleurum, page89, for a list of the constituents. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear, but is likely to be small, although further studies would help to clarify this. 1. Saruwatari J, Nakagawa K, Shindo J, Nachi S, Echizen H, Ishizaki T. The in-vivo effects of sho-saiko-to, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on two cytochrome P450 enzymes (1A2 and 3A) and sho-saiko-to and saiko-ka-ryukotsu- borei-to and carbamazepine is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence A study in ratsfound that the simultaneous administration of single doses of carbamazepine and sho-saiko-to , of which bupleurum is one of 7 constituents, delayed and lowered (by 45%) the maximum plasma concentrations of carbamazepine. The AUC of carbamaze-pine-epoxide was also modestly reduced by 32%, but there was nochange in elimination rate. In a related study rats were pretreated with sho-saiko-to daily for 2 weeks, and then, 24 hours later, given a single dose of carbamazepine. Although this tended to reduce themaximum carbamazepine level, there was no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine. 1 In a further study, ratstreated with saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to (of which bupleurum is one of 10 constituents) either as a single dose or as a daily dose for one week, experienced no change in thepharmacokinetics of a single dose of carbamazepine given 3 hoursafter the Chinese herbal medicine. 2 Mechanism It was found that sho-saiko-to delayed gastric emptying, and so it could delay absorption of carbamazepine when given at the sametime. It is unlikely that sho-saiko-to or saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-toaffects the metabolism of carbamazepine. 1 Importance and management While information regarding an interaction between bupleurum and carbamazepine is limited to experimental data using Chinese herbal medicines of which bupleurum is only one constituent, they provide some reassurance that these products are unlikely to affect themetabolism of carbamazepine. The first product, sho-saiko-to,slightly delayed the absorption of carbamazepine, especially whengiven simultaneously, but, since the extent of absorption was notsignificantly altered, this is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Othermain constituents of the products also seem unlikely to interact. See the table Constituents of some Chinese herbal medicines containing bupleurum, page 89, for a list of the constituents.1.

Bupleurum + Food There is limited experimental evidence from animal studies that the absorption of saikosaponins (the main constituents of bupleurum) might differ when taken with food as opposed to the fasting state,see Pharmacokinetics, page 89. Bupleurum + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Bupleurum + Ofloxacin Sho-saiko-to and Sairei-to do not appear to affect thepharmacokinetics of ofloxacin. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management The bioavailability and urinary recovery of a single 200-mg oral dose of ofloxacin were not significantly altered in 7 healthy subjects by two Chinese herbal medicines, Sho-saiko-to andSairei-to , which contain bupleurum as the main ingredient.1There would therefore seem to be no reason for avoiding concurrent use. Information aboutother quinolones is lacking. Other main constituents of theseproducts also seem unlikely to interact with ofloxacin. See the tableConstituents of some Chinese herbal medicines containing bupleurum, page 89, for a list of the constituents. 1. Hasegawa T, Yamaki K, Nadai M, Muraoka I, Wang L, Takagi K, Nabeshima T.

Bupleurum + Tolbutamide The interaction between sho-saiko-to and tolbutamide is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a single-dose study in rats, the initial rate of gastrointestinal absorption of tolbutamide 50 mg/kg given as a suspension was modestly increased when given simultaneously with sho-saiko-to ,o f which bupleurum is one of 7 constituents. The maximumtolbutamide level was slightly increased, by 21%; however, therewas no difference in tolbutamide AUC, clearance or eliminationhalf-life. The decrease in plasma glucose levels was greater duringthe first hour and less in the period 5 to 8 hours after both drugs weregiven, when compared with tolbutamide alone. However, at amaximum, sho-saiko-to increased the blood-glucose-lowering effects of tolbutamide by about 11%, which was not statisticallysignificant. 190 Bupleurum BIn contrast, in a similar study, the absorption of tolbutamide was delayed when tolbutamide was given 1 hour after the sho-saiko-to .2 Mechanism In vitro studies have shown that sho-saiko-to increases the permeability of jejunal epithelial cells to tolbutamide, which could explain the increased absorption in the first study.1Conversely, the second study found that sho-saiko-to decreases gastric emptying rate(see also Bupleurum + Carbamazepine, page 90), which couldexplain the finding of delayed absorption. Importance and management These preliminary studies provide some evidence that sho-saiko-to might alter the absorption of tolbutamide, but, because of theircontrasting findings (one showed an increased rate of absorption andone showed delayed absorption), no conclusions can be drawn. Therate of absorption of tolbutamide is probably unlikely to alter clinicalefficacy. This suggestion is supported by the finding of minimal changes in blood-glucose levels in one of the studies. Note that any interaction cannot be directly attributed to bupleurum as sho-saiko-tocontains a number of constituents, any one of which may beresponsible for the effects seen. See the table Constituents of someChinese herbal medicines containing bupleurum, page 89, for a listof the constituents. 1. Nishimura N, Naora K, Hirano H, Iwamoto K.

Burnet + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Burnet + Quinolones The interaction between burnet and quinolones is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an animal study, ratswere given a burnet powdered extract 2 g/kgandciprofloxacin , both orally. The maximum levels and AUC of ciprofloxacin were found to be reduced by 94% and 78%, respectively, by the herb.1 MechanismIt is possible that the metal cations present in the extract may have formed chelates with ciprofloxacin thereby reducing its bioavail-ability. 1 Importance and management Evidence is limited, but it appears that burnet may reduce the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin. Burnet was given in a clinically relevant dose, and the reduction in levels seen would therefore be expected to result in a clinically relevant reduction in the efficacy ofciprofloxacin. With other chelation interactions with ciprofloxacin,separating administration to reduce the admixture of the two drugs inthe gut minimises any interaction. In general, ciprofloxacin shouldbe taken at least 2 hours before, and not less than 4 to 6 hours after,drugs that it may chelate with, such as those containing polyvalentcations; this would appear to include burnet. The majority of the quinolone antibacterials are known to interact with polyvalent cations in the same way as ciprofloxacin, and it would thereforeseem prudent to extend this caution to all of them. 1.

Adv Therapy (2006) 23, 373 -84.B 96Caffeine The information in this monograph relates specifically to caffeine. A number of herbs contain significant amounts of caffeine, to which many of their pharmacological effects may be attributed. Their caffeine content also means thatthey have the potential to interact in the same way as caffeine itself, although note that the levels of caffeine are likely to vary widely between different herbal medicines and prod-ucts. Also, remember that the herbs often contain activeconstituents other than caffeine, and the reader should refer to the relevant herb for other potential interactions. Types, sources and related compounds Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, coffeinum, guaranine, koffein, methyltheobromine, th\u00e9ine) is found in significant quantities, in approximate order of highest to lowest levels: in the seeds of guarana, page 243, the leaves of tea,page 382, the nuts of cola, page 148, the beans of coffee,page 145, the leaves of mat\u00e9, page 282, and the beans of cocoa, page 139. Cocoa contains significant amounts of thexanthine theobromine. Note that rooibos, page 341, and honeybush, page 249, which are commonly used as a tea- like beverage, do not contain caffeine. Pharmacopoeias Caffeine (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ,USP 32 ); Caffeine hydrate (BP 2009 ); Caffeine monohydrate ( Ph Eur 6.4 ); Caffeine citrate injection (USP 32 ); Caffeine citrate oral solution (USP 32). Uses and administration Extracts of caffeine-containing herbs have been used medicinally for their stimulant and diuretic effects, andmay be promoted as slimming aids and for boosting energy.As foods, caffeine and caffeine-containing herbs are very widely consumed as beverages and, on regular consumption, partial tolerance develops to many of the pharmacologicaleffects of caffeine. Caffeine may induce dependence, andstopping intake abruptly can cause withdrawal. Consumption Conventional drugs that are known inhibitors of the metabolism of caffeine Drug Reduction in clearance Prolongation of half-life Recommendation Potent inhibitors (clearance reduced by more than two-thirds) Fluvoxamine 80% 5-31hours An increase in the stimulant and adverse effects of caffeine (headache, jitteriness, restlessness, insomnia)may be possible in susceptible patients if they continue to consume large amounts of caffeine. They should be warned to reduce their caffeine intake if problems by one to two-thirds)Artemisinin 35% Unlikely to be clinically important in most patients, but bear this interaction in mind if the adverse effects of caffeine reduced by 20-30%) Antifungals: No action necessary Increases of this magnitude are veryunlikely to cause any clinically relevant effectsFluconazole 25% Terbinafine 21% 31% Combined sleeplessness, tremor, palpitations and headache. Caffeine-containing beverages have been associated with various health benefits in epidemiological studies, whichhave been attributed to other constituents such as the flavonoids. Pharmacokinetics Caffeine is predominantly metabolised the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, and is often used as a probe substrate to studythe effect of medicines and other substances on thisisoenzyme. 1,2The elimination half-life of caffeine is about 3 to 6 hours in adults, and is about twofold longer in peoplewho do not regularly consume caffeine. 2 In one study, the pharmacokinetics and subjective effects of caffeine were similar whether consumed as coffee orcola. 3 (a) Inhibitors of caffeine metabolism There are a number of medicines that are known inhibitors ofthe cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, by whichcaffeine is metabolised, and these are listed in the table Drugs and herbs affecting or metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, page 7. Very few of theseactually have warnings regarding their use with caffeine-containing beverages, so warnings are unlikely to be needed with concurrent use of caffeine, including that from caffeine- containing herbs. Nevertheless, if an increase in the stimu-lant and adverse effects of caffeine is seen in patients taking these drugs (most likely with those drugs that are potent inhibitors of caffeine metabolism), then the intake of caffeineshould be reduced.(b) Inducers of caffeine metabolism Barbiturates and phenytoin induce CYP1A2, by which caffeine is metabolised, and they would therefore be expected to reduce the effects of caffeine, including thatfrom caffeine-containing herbs. Interactions overview Caffeine is a vasopressor and stimulant and it therefore mayantagonise the effects of antihypertensive drugs and benzodiazepines. It may also cause serious adverse effects if used with other drugs or herbs with similar effects, such asphenylpropanolamine, bitter orange and ephedra (see page176). Caffeine may interfere with the dexamethasone suppression test, and the efficacy of adenosine and dipyridamole used during cardiac imaging. Caffeine mayraise clozapine levels, and has modest effects on the absorption of some analgesics, but probably does not significantly affect lithium levels. Note that caffeine is known to have diuretic effects. Therefore caffeine-containing herbs may produce a degree of additive diuresis with other diuretics. The inhibitory effects of conventional drugs on caffeine metabolism, and management recommendations, are sum- marised in the table Conventional drugs that are known inhibitors of the metabolism of caffeine, page 97. 1.

Pharmacol Biochem Behav (1997) 58, 721 -6.98 Caffeine CCaffeine Caffeine can inhibit the effects of adenosine infusions used in conjunction with radionuclide myocardial imaging. Clinical evidence Studies in healthy subjects, on the way xanthine drugs such as caffeine possibly interact with adenosine, have shown that caffeinereduces the increased heart rate and the changes in blood pressurecaused by infusions of adenosine, 1,2and attenuates adenosine- induced vasodilatation.3 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Caffeine has an antagonistic effect on adenosine receptors.4It appears to have opposite effects on the circulatory system: caffeine causes vasoconstriction whereas adenosine infusions generally causevasodilatation. 1Consequently their concurrent use is likely to result in opposing effects. Importance and management Caffeine can inhibit the effects of adenosine infusions used in conjunction with radionuclide myocardial imaging. The turers of adenosine state that xanthine-containing drinks (tea, coffee,chocolate, cola drinks, etc.) should be avoided for at least 12 hoursbefore imaging, 5and this should be taken to include caffeine- containing herbs or supplements. In a recent study in 70 patients,measurable caffeine serum levels were found in 74% of patients after12 hours of self-reported abstention from caffeine-containing prod-ucts. Patients with caffeine serum levels of at least 2.9 mg/L had significantly fewer stress symptoms (chest tightness, chest pain, headache, dyspnoea, nausea, dizziness) than those with lower serumlevels. The authors suggest that a 12-hour abstention from caffeine-containing products may be insufficient, and could result in false-negative results. 6 There appears to be no direct evidence regarding the effects of caffeine on the use of adenosine boluses to revert supraventriculartachycardias. 1.

Caffeine + Antihypertensives Caffeine can cause a modest increase in blood pressure, whichmay be relevant to patients with hypertension. Clinical evidence In a number of studies, acute caffeine intake, comparable to the usual population intake, was found to cause an increase of about 5 to15 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 5 to 10 mmHg in diastolicblood pressure. 1However, studies of repeated intake generally showed more modest increases. For example, in one meta-analysisof 7 caffeine studies (median daily dose 410 mg), the increase in blood pressure was about 4/2 mmHg. 2 It is unclear whether the form caffeine is taken in makes adifference. For example, one meta-analysis found that blood pressure increases after coffee intake were lower than that frompure caffeine. 2See also Coffee + Antihypertensives, page 146. There appears to be very little evidence on the effect of caffeine intake on blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients. One single-dose study suggested that coffee attenuated the effects of betablockers. See Coffee + Antihypertensives, page 146. Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Caffeine is an antagonist of endogenous adenosine and, as a result of this, it causes vasoconstriction, which raises blood pressure. It hasbeen suggested that tolerance develops to this effect. However, it ispossible that near complete sensitivity to caffeine is restored eachday after an 'overnight fast ', and that during the day the increase in blood pressure seen with each caffeine intake is proportionally lessthan the previous intake, until a plateau is reached (availableadenosine receptors are saturated). 1This is possible with moderate intake of caffeine (3 to 4 drinks of caffeine-containing beverages).1 Importance and management An extensively studied interaction. Some consider that the modest increase in blood pressure of about 4/2 mmHg with caffeine intake has little relevance, whereas others consider it important.1Bear in mind the possibility that caffeine intake from herbal supplements might modestly increase blood pressure, and that this might not beadvisable in patients with poorly controlled hypertension. Interactions of antihypertensive drugs and specific caffeine- containing herbal medicines are discussed in the individual mono-graphs. Consider also Cocoa + Antihypertensives, page 140, Coffee+ Antihypertensives, page 146, Cola + Antihypertensives, page 149, and Tea + Antihypertensives, page 383. 1. James JE.

Adding caffeine to diclofenac may improve its efficacy in the treatment of migraine. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in healthy subjects, caffeine citrate 120 mg given with a single 650-mg dose of aspirin increased the AUC of aspirin by 36%,increased its maximum plasma levels by 15% and increased its rateof absorption by 30%. 1This confirms the results of previous studies.2,3These studies suggest that caffeine could modestly potentiate the efficacy of aspirin by a pharmacokinetic mechanism.However, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled studies con-cluded that there was no therapeutic advantage in adding caffeine toanalgesic doses of aspirin in patients experiencing postoperativepain. 4 In a placebo-controlled study in patients with migraine, there was a non-significant trend towards improved analgesic effect in patients receiving diclofenac softgel capsules 100 mg and caffeine 100 mg, when compared with diclofenac alone, although the sample size wastoo small to provide meaningful results. 5 Caffeine is commonly included in aspirin preparations as an analgesic adjuvant, but its overall value still remains unclear. Itseems unlikely that caffeine-containing herbs will have any detri-mental effect as a result of their caffeine content if they are given with these analgesics. However, note that if aspirin or diclofenac formulated with caffeine is given there is the potential for caffeineCaffeine 99 Cadverse effects (such as headache, jitteriness, restlessness and insomnia). Caffeine intake should be reduced if this occurs. 1. Thithapandha A. Effect of caffeine on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of aspirin. J Med Assoc Thai (1989) 72, 562 -6. 2.

Caffeine + Benzodiazepines and related drugs Caffeine appears to antagonise the effects of the benzodiazepines (mainly sedative effects, but possibly also anxiolytic effects). Theeffects of zopiclone may be similarly antagonised. Clinical evidence (a) Benzodiazepines In a study in healthy subjects, a single 250-mg or 500-mg dose of caffeine (added to decaffeinated coffee) counteracted the drowsinessand mental slowness induced by a single 10- to 20-mg dose of diazepam .1The same or a similar study has been reported elsewhere.2Conversely, in a study in 6 healthy subjects, the concurrent use of caffeine 6 mg/kg and diazepam 300 micrograms/ kg did not antagonise the effects of either drug; however, caffeinecaused a minor 22% reduction in diazepam levels.3In one study the sedative effects of midazolam4were moderately antagonised by caffeine 250 mg but not 125 mg, and there is also some evidence tosuggest that caffeine and clonazepam5ortriazolam6have mutually opposing effects. No pharmacokinetic interaction appears to occur between caffeine andmidazolam7oralprazolam .8 (b) Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics Zopiclone 7.5 mg appears to counter the stimulant effects of caffeine 300 mg more easily than caffeine counters the sedative effects of zopiclone .6In one study, no pharmacokinetic interaction occurred between zolpidem 10 mg and caffeine 300 mg (added to decaffein- ated coffee), and the hypnotic effects of zolpidem were unchanged,9 whereas in another study, caffeine 250 mg or 500 mg modestlyincreased zolpidem 7.5 mg levels, and partially reversed its effects.10 Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Uncertain. One suggestion is that caffeine can block adenosine receptors, leading to CNS stimulation, which would antagonise theCNS depressant effects of the benzodiazepines. 11Another suggestion is that the stimulant effects of caffeine and the sedative effects ofbenzodiazepines are simply antagonistic. Importance and management The evidence suggests that caffeine, particularly at higher doses, at least partially reduces the sedative and performance-impairing effects of benzodiazepines and related hypnotics. This would appearto be a disadvantage at night, but may possibly be useful the nextmorning, although caffeine should not be considered an antidote tothe residual effects of these hypnotics. The extent to which caffeinereduces the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepines remainsuncertain (it needs assessment), but be alert for reduced benzo- diazepine effects if both are used. Regardless of any interaction, caffeine-containing herbs should probably be used cautiously inpatients with anxiety disorders and insomnia as these are recognisedadverse effects of caffeine. 1.

Eur J Clin Pharmacol (1998) 54, 421 Lancet (1984) -4. Caffeine + Clozapine Caffeine increases serum clozapine levels, which may increase the incidence of its adverse effects. Clinical evidence A study in 12 healthy subjects1found that caffeine 400 mg to 1 g daily raised the AUC and decreased the clearance of a single 12.5-mg dose of clozapine by 19% and 14%, respectively. Aprevious study in 7 patients had found that clozapine levelsdecreased by 47% when the subjects avoided caffeine for 5 days, and increased again when caffeine consumption was resumed. 2In a crossover study, 6 coffee-drinking patients taking clozapine weregiven decaffeinated or caffeine-containing instant coffee for 7 days.The plasma levels of clozapine were 26% higher while the patientswere taking caffeine-containing coffee. 3 Another patient taking clozapine for schizophrenia had an exacerbation of his psychotic symptoms, which was attributed to caffeinated coffee (5 to 10 cups daily). The problem resolved when the patient stopped drinking caffeine-containing beverages. He had previously not had any problems when consuming caffeine coffeewhile taking haloperidol 30 mg and procyclidine 30 mg daily. 4 A 31-year-old woman taking clozapine 550 mg daily developed increased daytime sleepiness, sialorrhoea and withdrawn behaviourafter taking caffeine (about 1.2 g daily, as drinks and tablets). Herplasma clozapine levels fell from 1.5 micrograms/mL to 0.63 micro- grams/mL when her caffeine intake was stopped. 5A 66-year-old woman taking clozapine 300 mg daily developed supraventricular tachycardia (180 bpm) when she was given 500 mg of intravenouscaffeine sodium benzoate to increase seizure length during an ECTsession. Verapamil was needed to correct the arrhythmia. Beforetaking clozapine she had received caffeine sodium benzoate in dosesof up to 1 g during ECT sessions without problems. 6 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism This interaction is thought to occur because caffeine and clozapine compete for the same metabolic pathway (cytochrome P450 resulting olism and its accumulation.1,2,7100 Caffeine CImportance and management This would appear to be an established and clinically important interaction, but unlikely to be a problem if clozapine serum levelsare established and well monitored, and if caffeine intake remainsfairly stable and moderate. Possible exceptions are if large doses of caffeine are given during ECT treatment or if for some other reason the caffeine intake suddenly increases or decreases markedly.Patients taking clozapine should probably avoid taking large dosesof caffeine-containing herbal preparations. 1.

Caffeine + Dexamethasone The results of the dexamethasone suppression test can befalsified by the acute ingestion of caffeine, but chronic caffeineuse does not appear to have an effect. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In one study, 22 healthy subjects and 6 depressed patients were given a single 480-mg dose of caffeine or placebo at 2 pm followinga single 1-mg dose of dexamethasone given at 11 pm the previousevening. Caffeine significantly increased the cortisol levels follow-ing the dexamethasone dose; cortisol levels taken at 4 pm were about146 nanomol/L with caffeine, compared with about 64 nanomol/Lwith placebo. 1Thus the equivalent of about 4 to 5 cups of coffee may effectively falsify the results of the dexamethasone suppressiontest. However, in a study in 121 patients with depression, there wasno correlation between chronic low to high intake of caffeine (6 mgto 2.3 g daily) and cortisol levels at 8 am, 4 pm or 11 pm on the dayafter a 1-mg dose of dexamethasone given at 11 pm the previousevening. It was suggested that chronic caffeine intake producestolerance to the effects of acute caffeine on the hypothalamic - pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis. 2 Therefore, it appears that the results of the dexamethasone suppression test can be falsified by the acute ingestion of a high doseof caffeine but that chronic caffeine use does not appear to have aneffect. As chronic intake of caffeine does not appear to affect thistest, it does not seem necessary to advise patients to stop any regularintake of caffeine-containing herbs. However, bear the potential foran interaction with caffeine-containing herbs in mind should anunexpected response occur. 1. Uhde TW, Bierer LM, Post RM.

Caffeine + Dipyridamole Caffeine may interfere with dipyridamole -thallium-201 cardial scintigraphy tests. Clinical evidence Intravenous caffeine 4 mg/kg (roughly equivalent to 2 to 3 cups of coffee), given before dipyridamole -thallium-201 myocardial scinti-graphy, caused a false-negative test result in a patient.1A further study in 8 healthy subjects confirmed that caffeine inhibits thehaemodynamic response to an infusion of dipyridamole. 2 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism It appears that caffeine might antagonise some of the haemodynamic effects of dipyridamole because it acts as a competitive antagonist of adenosine (an endogenous vasodilator involved in the action of dipyridamole).1,2 Importance and management An interaction between caffeine and intravenous dipyridamole is established. Patients should abstain from caffeine from any source,including caffeine-containing herbal preparations, caffeine-contain- ing beverages (tea, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, cola) and caffeine- containing analgesics. 1-3for 24 hours2,4before dipyridamole testing. If during the test the haemodynamic response is low (e.g. no increasein heart rate) the presence of caffeine should be suspected. 2Patients should be specifically prompted to discuss less obvious potentialsources such as herbal medicines. 1.

UK Summary of product characteristics, July 2004. Caffeine + Food; Caffeine-containing The effects of dietary caffeine and caffeine from herbalmedicines will be additive. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management The effects of caffeine from herbal medicines will be additive with that from caffeine-containing food (chocolate) and beverages (tea,coffee, cola). People who want to take a caffeine-containing herbalmedicine should be aware of the possible increased risk of adverseeffects, including headache, jitteriness, restlessness and insomnia.They should be warned to reduce their caffeine intake if problemsdevelop. Caffeine + Herbal medicines; Bitter orange The use of caffeine with bitter orange may lead to severe cardiac adverse effects. Bitter orange does not affect the metabolism of caffeine. Clinical evidence (a) Cardiovascular effects Some evidence suggests that the haemodynamic effects of caffeine and bitter orange are synergistic. In a single-dose, crossover study in10 healthy subjects, a combination product containing, among otheringredients, bitter orange, mat\u00e9 and cocoa (Xenadrine EFX), and a bitter orange product ( Advantra Z , containing synephrine 15.6 mg), both increased heart rate (by 16.7 bpm and11.4 bpm, respectively) when compared with placebo. Xenadrine EFX increased blood pressure (by 9.6/9.1 mmHg), whereasAdvantra Z did not. Advantra Z contained eight times the dose ofCaffeine 101 Csynephrine, a sympathomimetic alkaloid found in bitter orange, than Xenadrine (46.9 mg versus 5.5 mg), so it was concluded that caffeine and other stimulants in the Xenadrine must be acting synergistically with the synephrine.1Although this study did not find that bitter orange alone increased blood pressure, another single-dose study, in13 healthy subjects, found that bitter orange ( Nature 's Way Bitter Orange , containing synephrine about 54 mg per capsule) increased systolic blood pressure by 7.3 mmHg and the heart rate by 4.2 bpm,when compared with placebo. 2 Case reports suggest that this increase in blood pressure might be clinically important. For example, an ischaemic stroke occurred in a 38-year-old man with no relevant past medical history or risk factors for stroke or cardiovascular disease. The stroke occurred one weekafter he started taking one to two capsules per day of Stacker 2 Ephedra Free weight-loss supplement, which contains bitter orange and cola nut extract, giving synephrine 6 mg and caffeine 200 mg percapsule. 3Furthermore, from January 1998 to February 2004, Health Canada received 16 reports of serious cardiovascular adverse reactions (including tachycardia, cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrilla- tion, transient collapse and blackout) that were suspected of beingassociated with bitter orange or supplements containing synephrine.In 15 of these cases, the product also contained caffeine: in 8 ofthose 15 cases the product also contained ephedra. 4Note that the use of caffeine with ephedra has been associated with severe cardiaceffects, see Ephedra + Caffeine, page 176. From March 2004 toOctober 2006, Health Canada noted an additional 21 reports, of which 15 were cardiovascular adverse effects. 5One of these included a report of a myocardial infarction in a patient possibly precipitated by the use of a weight-loss supplement containing bitterorange 300 mg as well as guarananine and green tea ( Edita 's Skinny Pill). 6 (b) Pharmacokinetics In a study in 12 healthy subjects,7bitter orange 350 mg, standardised to synephrine 4%, was given twice daily for 28 days with a single 100-mg dose of caffeine before and at the end of the treatment withbitter orange. The metabolism of caffeine was not affected by theconcurrent use of bitter orange, which suggests that bitter orange isunlikely to affect the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2. Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Uncertain. Synephrine, a sympathetic alpha-adrenergic agonist, is one of the main constituents found in bitter orange, although theconcentrations will vary between products. Simple additivehypertensive effects would seem to be part of the explanation. The effects of caffeine may compound the effects of these sympatho- mimetic drugs on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems byblocking adenosine receptors (causing vasoconstriction) and alsoaugmenting the release of catecholamines. Importance and management Fairly well-established interactions. These studies and case reports illustrate the potential hazards of using caffeine-containing herbswith bitter orange, even in healthy individuals, so these preparationsmay pose a serious health risk to some users. The risk may beaffected by individual susceptibility, the additive stimulant effectsof caffeine, the variability in the contents of alkaloids innon-prescription dietary supplements or pre-existing medical condi- tions, 8including compromised cardiac function.9Ephedra was banned by the FDA in the US in 2004 and, as a result of this, many manufacturers replaced it with bitter orange which contains asimilar sympathomimetic alkaloid, synephrine. Evidence shows thatthese products are no safer than ephedra products when used in asimilar way. It would be prudent to avoid using herbal productscontaining combinations of bitter orange and caffeine or caffeine-containing herbs, especially in patients with risk factors such as heart conditions, diabetes, thyroid disease or hypertension.1.

Caffeine + Lithium The heavy consumption of caffeine-containing drinks may cause a small-to-moderate reduction in serum lithium levels. Clinical evidence An early single-dose study found that the intake of xanthines such as caffeine caused an increase in lithium excretion.1In contrast, another single-dose study did not find any significant changes in urinary clearance of lithium in 6 subjects given caffeine 200 mg four times daily compared with a caffeine-free control period.2However, in a study in 11 psychiatric patients taking lithium 600 mg to 1.2 g dailywho were also regular coffee drinkers (4 to 8 cups daily containing 70 to 120 mg of caffeine per cup), serum lithium levels rose by anaverage of 24% when the coffee was withdrawn, although the levels of 3 patients did not change.3These findings are consistent with another report of 2 patients with lithium-induced tremors that wereaggravated when they stopped drinking large amounts of coffee . One of the patients had a 50% rise in lithium levels, and required areduction in lithium dose from 1.5 g daily to 1.2 g daily. 4 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism It is not clear exactly how caffeine affects the excretion of lithium by the renal tubules. Importance and management The weight of evidence suggests that, although there is no need for patients taking lithium to avoid caffeine (from caffeine-containing herbs, coffee, tea, cola drinks, etc.), they should stick to a moderate intake, and, in cases where a reduction in caffeine intake is desirable,it should be withdrawn cautiously. This is particularly important inpatients whose serum lithium levels are already high, because of therisk of toxicity. When caffeine is withdrawn it may be necessary toreduce the dose of lithium. In addition, remember that there is acaffeine-withdrawal syndrome (headache and fatigue being themajor symptoms) that might worsen some of the major psychiatric disorders (such as affective and schizophrenic disorders), 3for which lithium is given. Although the evidence is for caffeine and coffee, all caffeine-containing herbal medicines would be expected to havesimilar effects, and similar caution should be applied to their use. 1.

J Clin Psychiatry (1988) 49, 72 -3.102 Caffeine CCaffeine + Nicotine Caffeine may boost some of the stimulant effects of nicotine, but it only appears to cause a small, if any, rise in nicotine levels. Clinical evidence In a study in 21 smokers who regularly drank one to six cups of coffee daily, a 50-mg tablet of caffeine increased self-ratings of 'stimulated ','alert' and 'jittery 'at various doses of nicotine chewing gum (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg) when compared with the nicotine gum alone.1In a placebo-controlled study, 12 healthy subjects were given nicotine 1 mg or 2 mg with caffeine 50 mg or 100 mg, in a chewing gum. Nicotine alone and caffeine alone increased energyexpenditure, but adding caffeine 50 mg to nicotine 1 mg had almostdouble the effects of simply increasing the nicotine dose from 1 to2 mg. Similar effects were seen in both smokers and non-smokers.No adverse effects were reported with either nicotine 1 mg alone or combined with caffeine. 2In a similar study by the same authors, caffeine enhanced the appetite-suppressant effects of nicotine.3In another study in 13 smokers who regularly drank at least one cup of coffee daily, pre-treatment with oral caffeine 2.5 or 5 mg/kg (addedto 180 mL of decaffeinated coffee) did not alter the subjects 'ability to discriminate between nasal nicotine and placebo, and did not alterthe amount of caffeine that they self-administered during a period ofsmoking cessation. Caffeine pre-treatment caused a modest dose- related increase in nicotine levels (maximum 21%). 4In a study in 12 smokers, two doses of caffeine 150 mg (given in a decaffeinated cola drink before and during smoking) had no effect on the plasma levelsof nicotine achieved by smoking 5 cigarettes. 5 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Not understood. Importance and management A fairly well-studied interaction. Caffeine may boost some of the stimulant effects of nicotine (energy consumption, appetite suppres-sion, but also adverse effects such as jitteriness), but it only appears to cause a small, if any, rise in nicotine levels. Bear the potential for this increase in effects in mind should a patient receiving nicotinereplacement therapy and also taking caffeine supplements developtroublesome nicotine-related adverse effects. 1.

Caffeine + Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) Caffeine has been variously reported to increase, decrease and have no effect on the absorption of paracetamol. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in 10 healthy subjects, caffeine citrate 120 mg increased the AUC of a single 500-mg dose of paracetamol by 29%, increased the maximum plasma levels by 15% and decreased the total bodyclearance by 32%. The decrease in time to maximum level andincrease in absorption rate did not reach statistical significance. 1A randomised, crossover study in 24 healthy subjects found that a single 130-mg dose of caffeine slightly increased the rate of absorption of a single 1-g dose of paracetamol; however, the overallbioavailability was not altered by caffeine. They also noted anincreased and prolonged analgesic effects, which correlated with thepharmacokinetic results. 2Similarly, in another study, although caffeine slightly increased the rate of absorption of paracetamol, ithad no effect on the extent of absorption. 3In contrast, a third study states that caffeine decreased plasma paracetamol levels and its AUC, and increased paracetamol elimination in healthy men.4 Caffeine is commonly included in paracetamol preparations as an analgesic adjuvant. No serious adverse effects appear to have beenreported with this combination; however, its potential benefit and themechanisms behind its possible effects remain unclear. It seemsunlikely that caffeine-containing herbs will have any detrimentaleffect as a result of their caffeine content if they are given with paracetamol. However, note that if paracetamol formulated with caffeine is given there is the potential for additive caffeine adverseeffects (such as headache, jitteriness, restlessness and insomnia).Caffeine intake should be reduced if this occurs. 1.

Caffeine + Phenylpropanolamine Phenylpropanolamine can raise blood pressure and in some cases this may be further increased by caffeine. Combined usehas resulted in hypertensive crises in a few individuals. An isolated report describes the development of acute psychosis when caffeine was given with phenylpropanolamine. Phenylpro-panolamine greatly raises caffeine levels. Clinical evidence In a placebo-controlled study, the mean blood pressure of 16 healthy subjects rose by 11/12 mmHg after they took caffeine 400 mg, by12/13 mmHg after they took phenylpropanolamine 75 mg, and by 12/11 mmHg when both drugs were taken. Phenylpropanolamine 150 mg caused a greater rise of 36/18 mmHg. One of the subjectshad a hypertensive crisis after taking phenylpropanolamine 150 mgand again 2 hours after taking caffeine 400 mg. This neededantihypertensive treatment. 1The same group of workers describe a similar study in which the AUC of caffeine 400 mg increased bymore than threefold, and the mean peak caffeine concentrationincreased almost fourfold (from 2.1 to 8 micrograms/mL) after phenylpropanolamine 75 mg was given. 2Additive increases in blood pressure are described in another report.3 A review describes 41 severe adverse reactions to phenylpro- panolamine. Of these cases, caffeine was also taken by 15 subjects, with outcomes such as stroke and seizure. However, it should benoted that these effects were similar to those seen in patients whohad taken phenylpropanolamine alone. 4 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Additive pharmacological effects. Importance and management Evidence is limited and an adverse effect is not fully established,Caffeine 103 Cespecially as hypertensive episodes, stroke and seizures have been reported with the use of phenylpropanolamine alone. One possibleexplanation for the lack of reports could be that these interactions may go unrecognised or be attributed to one drug only, e.g. phenylpropanolamine, whereas caffeine has also been taken inbeverages (often not reported). The risk may be affected byindividual susceptibility, the additive stimulant effects of caffeine,the variability in the contents of caffeine and other sympathomimeticalkaloids in non-prescription dietary supplements, or pre-existingmedical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. Note that,phenylpropanolamine was available formulated with caffeine. Phenylpropanolamine is no longer available in the US and UK, and its use has been restricted in many other countries. The authors of one report 1advised that users of phenylpropanol- amine should be warned about the over-use of phenylpropanol-amine, and also about taking caffeine at the same time, because ofthe possible risk of intracranial haemorrhage secondary to severehypertension. 1It would therefore seem prudent to also avoid the use of caffeine-containing herbal medicines. If both drugs are giventhere is the potential for increased caffeine adverse effects (such asheadache, jitteriness, restlessness and insomnia). Caffeine intakeshould be reduced if this occurs. 1.

Caffeine + Theophylline Caffeine can raise serum theophylline levels.Clinical evidence Caffeine can decrease the clearance of theophylline by 18 to 29%, prolong its half-life by up to 44% and increase its average serumlevels by as much as 23%. 1-3In addition, caffeine plasma levels have been increased about twofold when theophylline was given.2In these studies, caffeine was given in the form of tablets1,2or as 2 to 7 cups of instant coffee.3In one study, 2 of the subjects who did not normally drink coffee experienced headaches and nausea.2 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism The probable mechanism of the interaction is that the two drugs compete for the same metabolic route resulting in a reduction in theirmetabolism and accumulation. In addition, when caffeine levels arehigh, a small percentage of it is converted to theophylline. Importance and management There would seem to be no good reason for patients taking theophylline to avoid caffeine (in herbal preparations, beverages such as coffee, tea, cola drinks, or medications, etc.), but if otherwiseunexplained adverse effects occur it might be worth considering ifcaffeine use could be responsible. 1.

There are various types of calamus, mainly reflecting geographical origin: type I is an American diploid variety, type II is a European triploid, and types III and IV are subtropical tetraploids. Constituents The main active constituents are found in the volatile oil, butconsiderable qualitative and quantitative differences arefound between different species and varieties. Tetraploid(subtropical, specifically Indian) species contain 96% -asarone (isoasarone), whereas triploid (European) species contain 5% and diploid (North American) species varyingamounts. Use and indications -Asarone is considered to be toxic (based on the results ofanimal studies) and it is recommended that oils containing this substance should be avoided. Calamus is traditionallyused as a carminative and spasmolytic, in acute and chronicdyspepsia, gastritis and gastric ulcer, intestinal colic andanorexia, and for respiratory disorders. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview No calamus found.C ). Constituents Calendula flower extracts contain mainly triterpenes . Also acid rutin) have also been identified. Use and indications Calendula is often used in externally applied products for the treatment of cuts, bruises, burns and scalds, and topically forconjunctivitis. It has also been used to treat gastric andduodenal ulcers, haemorrhoids and varicose veins.Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found specifically forcalendula extracts, but the pharmacokinetics of oleanolic acid have been evaluated. Incubation with rat liver microsomes suggests that oleanolic acid is likely to be extensively metabolised in the liver by hydroxylation, butthe exact sites for this were not determined. 1For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present incalendula, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview No interactions with calendula found. For information on theinteractions of individual flavonoids present in calendula,see under flavonoids, page 1.

Cannabis indica Constituents Cannabis herb contains a wide range of cannabinoids, which are the major active compounds. The main psychoactive constituent is 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; dronabinol), and it is the cause of many of the pharmacological effects elicited by the consumption of cannabis. However, other cannabinoids, which do not possess psychoactive properties,such cannabidiol, cannabigerol and cannabichro- mene, are increasingly being investigated for their pharma-cological and therapeutic properties. Cannabinoids are oftenfound in the plant as their acid metabolites, e.g. 11-nor-9-carboxy- 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol acid and others, especially if the plant has been grown in a coolerclimate. These decarboxylate to the parent cannabinoid athigh temperatures, such as during smoking. Most medicinalcannabis products have been heat treated to ensure that the cannabinoids are present only in the non-acid form. Use and indications Cannabis has no current established use in herbal medicine because of its legal position in most parts of the world. However, medicinal cannabis is increasingly being used to treat chronic conditions, as an adjunct, or where othertreatments may be inadequate. For example, a buccal spray preparation of cannabis, containing mainly dronabinol (the medicinal name for 9-tetrahydrocannabinol) with cannabi- diol, is available as an adjunctive treatment for the symp-tomatic relief of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis in adults. It is also being investigated for use as an analgesic in other disease states such as diabetic neuropathy andrheumatoid arthritis, and to relieve spasticity in multiplesclerosis and spinal cord injury. Dronabinol and nabilone (a synthetic cannabinol) are used as antiemetics in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, and dronabinol has beenused as an appetite stimulant in AIDS. Cannabis is a widelyused illicit drug because of its psychoactive properties, and has a long history of such use, including by those with chronic illnesses. Varieties of Cannabis sativa that contain very little cannabinoids (often referred to as hemp) have beencultivated for their fibre and seeds, and these, and the oilderived from the seeds, may be found in some herbalproducts.Pharmacokinetics The most important pharmacokinetic effects of cannabisdepend on whether the herb (or its extracts) are smoked ortaken orally. When smoked, cannabinoid acids are decar-boxylated by the high temperature, and reach the lung as active free cannabinoids. Psychotropic effects start from within seconds to a few minutes, reach a maximum after 20to 30 minutes, and taper off within 3 to 4 hours. If the samepreparation were to be taken orally, however, cannabinoid acid absorption would be lower and much less predictable, 1 with psychotropic effects starting after a delay of 30 to 90 minutes, reaching their maximum after 2 to 4 hours andlasting for about 6 hours. The metabolism of cannabis is complex, resulting in both active and inactive compounds. The cannabinoids areextensively metabolised by cannabis may induce CYP1A2, page 113, and also clozapine, page 110. Dronabinol has also beenshown to inhibit CYP1A1, despite increasing its expression. 3 Cannabis also induces the expression of CYP2E1 andCYP2D6 in mice. 4 Research suggests that some constituents of cannabis can affect others. Cannabidiol, an active but non-psychotropic cannabinoid, has been shown to partially inhibit the hydroxylation of dronabinol, probably by CYP2C.5There is limited evidence that some cannabinoids might inhibit P- glycoprotein6or reduce P-glycoprotein expression.7 Interactions overview Most of the drug interaction data relate to smoking cannabis. Smoking cannabis has been shown to decrease levels and probably clozapine. Useof transdermal nicotine with cannabis enhances tachycardia, and increases the stimulant effect of cannabis. Tachycardia has also been seen with combined use of tricyclicantidepressants and cannabis. Cannabis might increase theeffects of opioids such as morphine. Isolated cases of hypomania have been seen when cannabis was used with disulfiram and with fluoxetine, and a man taking cannabisand sildenafil had a myocardial infarction. Another case report describes a fatal stroke in a young man who received cisplatin and smoked cannabis. Indometacin might antagon-ise some of the effects of smoking cannabis. Smokingcannabis does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics or antiviral efficacy of indinavir or nelfinavir, and oral cannabis does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of docetaxelor irinotecan. 1.

However, there is some evidence that regular cannabis usein itself does not potentiate the effects of alcohol. Smokingcannabis may alter the bioavailability of alcohol. Evidence and mechanism (a) CNS effects Simultaneous use of alcohol and oral 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the major active ingredient of cannabis) reduced the performance of psychomotor tests, suggesting that those who useboth drugs together should expect the deleterious effects to beadditive. 1In a further placebo-controlled study, subjects smoked cannabis containing 100 or 200 micrograms/kg of 9-tetrahydro- cannabinol and drank alcohol (to achieve an initial blood level of70 mg%, with further drinks taken to maintain levels at 40 mg%) 30 minutes before driving. They found that cannabis, even in low-to- moderate doses, negatively affected driving performance in realtraffic situations. Further, the effect of combining moderate doses ofboth alcohol and cannabis resulted in dramatic performanceimpairment as great as that observed with blood-alcohol levels of140 mg% alone. 2,3Similar results (including a suggestion of a synergistic impairment of performance4) have been found in a number of other studies,4,5including different doses of cannabis and regular cannabis users.5 A study in 22 healthy subjects, who occasionally used cannabis cigarettes and drank moderate amounts of alcohol, found that thenumber of euphoric events in response to a cannabis cigarette wasgreater after alcohol ingestion, and the duration of euphoric eventswas longer. The speed of onset of the effects of cannabis was alsofaster when it was smoked after the ingestion of alcohol. 6 One study in 14 regular cannabis users (long-term daily use) and 14 infrequent cannabis users found that regular use reduced thedisruptive effects of alcohol on some psychomotor skills relevant todriving, whereas infrequent use did not have this effect. In this study,neither group had smoked any cannabis in the 12 hours before thealcohol test. 7Another study found that moderate doses of alcohol and cannabis, consumed either alone or in combination, did notproduce significant behavioural or subjective impairment the following day. 8 A study in 12 healthy subjects who regularly used both cannabis and alcohol found that alcohol 0.5 g/kg significantly increased break latency without affecting body sway, whereas cannabis given as acigarette containing tetrahydrocannabinol 3.33%, increased bodysway but did not affect brake latency. There were no significantadditive effects on brake latency, body sway or mood when the twodrugs were used together. 9A population-based study of 2,777 drivers involved in fatal road crashes, who drank alcohol and/or usedcannabis, found that, although both cannabis and alcohol increasedthe risk of being responsible for a fatal crash, no statisticallysignificant interaction was observed between the two drugs. 10 (b) Pharmacokinetic studies Fifteen healthy subjects given alcohol 0.7 g/kg developed peak plasma alcohol levels of about 78 mg% at 50 minutes, but, if theysmoked a cannabis cigarette 30 minutes after the drink, their peakplasma alcohol levels were only 55 mg% and they occurred55 minutes later. In addition, their subjective experience of the drugs decreased when used together. 11However, another study found that smoking cannabis 10 minutes before alcohol consumption did not affect blood-alcohol levels.8A further study found that blood- alcohol levels were not affected by 9-tetrahydrocannabinol given orally one hour before alcohol.1A study in 22 healthy subjects, who occasionally used cannabis cigarettes and drank moderate amountsof alcohol, found that plasma 9-tetrahydrocannabinol levels were higher when alcohol was consumed before smoking a cannabiscigarette. 6Importance and management Several studies have found that cannabis and alcohol produce additive detrimental effects on driving performance, but otherstudies have not found any potentiation. This is probably due to thevariety of simulated driving tests used and possibly the time lag between the administration of alcohol and cannabis; behavioural impairment after cannabis has been reported to peak within30 minutes of smoking. 8Nevertheless, both drugs have been shown to affect some aspects of driving performance and increasethe risk of fatal car accidents. Concurrent use of cannabis andalcohol before driving should therefore be avoided. 1. Bird KD, Boleyn T, Chesher GB, Jackson DM, Starmer GA, Teo RKC.

Clinical evidence A study in 31 patients found that the clearance of chlorpromazine was increased by 38% by tobacco smoking, by 50% by cannabis smoking, and by 107% when both tobacco and cannabis weresmoked. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Not established. The probable reason is that some of the components of tobacco smoke act as enzyme inducers, which increase the rate atwhich the liver metabolises chlorpromazine, thereby reducing itsserum levels and clinical effects. Importance and management Established interactions but of uncertain clinical importance. Be alert for the need to increase the dosages of chlorpromazine and related antipsychotics in patients who smoke, and reduce the dosages ifsmoking is stopped. 1. Chetty M, Miller R, Moodley SV. Smoking and body weight influence the clearance of chlorpromazine. Eur J Clin Pharmacol (1994) 46, 523 -6.Cannabis 109 CCannabis + Ciclosporin Cannabidiol, an important constituent of cannabis, may increase ciclosporin levels. This interaction is based on experimentalevidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study found that the incubation of human and mouse liver microsomes with cannabidiol, an active but non-psychoactive constituent of cannabis, resulted in inhibition of ciclosporinmetabolism. The production of ciclosporin metabolites was reducedby 73 to 83%. Similar results were found in studies in mice. 1 Mechanism Cannabidiol may inhibit the cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP3A, and so increase ciclosporin levels. affectthe metabolism of other CYP3A4 substrates, see Cannabis +Irinotecan, page 111. Importance and management These preclinical data suggest that one constituent of cannabis might possibly raise ciclosporin levels. These data require confirmation in humans. Until such data are available, bear in mind the possibility that irregular use of cannabis might be a factor in unstableciclosporin levels. It might be unwise for patients taking ciclosporinto cannabis. 1. Jaeger mouse and human microsomes. Xenobiotica (1996) 26, 275-84. Cannabis + Cisplatin A case report describes a fatal stroke when a young manreceiving cisplatin smoked cannabis. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A 27-year-old man who smoked cannabis and tobacco daily developed tinnitus and paraesthesias after receiving the first course of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, etoposide andbleomycin for testicular cancer. Following the second course of chemotherapy, thepatient reported distal paresis of the right arm and, 2 days later, about30 minutes after cannabis inhalation, he developed headache, paresisof his right leg and aphasia. A large thrombus was found in thecarotid artery. The patient died the next day. He had nocardiovascular risk factors apart from the smoking (about 4 cigarettes per day). 1 Cisplatin is known to carry a small risk of stroke, and cases have also been reported for cannabis smoking alone. In this case it was suggested that the use of cannabis may have also contributed to theadverse outcome in this patient. 1It might be prudent for patients receiving cisplatin to avoid smoking cannabis. 1. Russmann S, Winkler A, L\u00f6vblad KO, Stanga Z, C. Lethal ischemic after chemotherapy for testicular carcinoma and cannabis inhalation. Eur Neurol (2002) 48, 178 -80. Cannabis + Clozapine Patients who give up smoking cannabis may develop higherblood levels of clozapine and be at risk of adverse reactions, since plasma levels of clozapine are lower in smokers than in non-smokers.Clinical evidence A 37-year-old man who smoked both tobacco and cannabis daily, and took clozapine 700 mg daily, experienced elevated clozapineplasma levels and signs of clozapine toxicity, one month after hestopped smoking both tobacco and cannabis. One week after reducing the dose of clozapine to 500 mg daily, his psychotic symptoms disappeared and plasma levels returned to normal. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Tobacco smoke contains aromatic hydrocarbons that are potent inducers of the cytochrome P450 The cannabis smoking tothis case is unknown, but cannabis smoking alone is also known toinduce CYP1A2, independent of tobacco. See Cannabis + Theophyl-line, page 113. Importance and management It is known that patients who smoke tobacco may experience lower serum clozapine levels and, although there is no direct evidence, thismay equally apply to cannabis smoking. Irregular smoking ofcannabis might cause fluctuations in clozapine levels. 1. Zullino DF, Delessert D, Eap CB, Preisig M, Baumann P. Tobacco and cannabis smoking cessation can lead to intoxication with clozapine or olanzapine. Int Clin Psychopharmacol (2002) 17, 141 -3. Cannabis + Disulfiram Two isolated case reports describe hypomanic-like reactionswhen patients taking disulfiram used cannabis, whereas no unusual interaction with the combination was seen in other subjects. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A man with a 10-year history of drug abuse (alcohol, amfetamines, cocaine, cannabis) taking disulfiram 250 mg daily, experienced ahypomanic-like reaction (euphoria, hyperactivity, insomnia, irrit-ability) on two occasions, associated with the concurrent use of cannabis. The patient said that he felt as though he had been taking amfetamine. 1One other similar case has been reported.2The reason for this reaction is not understood. In a randomised study in alcohol-dependent subjects who had previously used cannabis, no unusualinteraction effects were found in a group of 11 subjects receivingdisulfiram and smoking cannabis twice weekly for 4 weeks. 3 Therefore the interaction described in the two case reports wouldnot appear to be of general significance. 1.

Cannabis + Docetaxel The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel are not altered by a herbaltea containing cannabis. Clinical evidence In a study investigating the effects of cannabis on docetaxel pharmacokinetics, 12 patients were given 200 mL of a herbal teacontaining cannabis 1 g/L each day for 15 days. The tea was prepared medicinal-grade cannabis clearance and the AUC of docetaxel given on day 12 of the cannabis tea were not significantly altered,when compared with docetaxel given before the cannabis tea. The dose of docetaxel used was 180 mg, reduced to 135 mg in 3 patients who experienced dose-related docetaxel toxicity. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Docetaxel is metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, and this does not appear to be affected by oral cannabis. Importance and management This study suggests that cannabis taken orally will not affect the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. No dosage adjustments are likely tobe needed if docetaxel is given with cannabis tea. 1It is not known if this applies to other drugs metabolised by CYP3A4, or to other preparations and routes of administration of cannabis, but see also Cannabis + Ciclosporin, page 110, and Cannabis + Irinotecan,below. 1.

Cannabis + Ecstasy The information regarding the use of cannabis with ecstasy is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Ananimal study found that pretreatment with cannabidiol, a major constituent of cannabis, did not affect the levels of ecstasy (MDMA, methylenedioxymethamfetamine) in the brain of mice.1 1. Reid MJ, Bornheim LM. Cannabinoid-induced alterations in brain disposition of Biochem Pharmacol (2001) 61, 1357 -67. Cannabis + Fluoxetine An isolated report describes mania when a patient taking fluoxetine smoked cannabis. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A 21-year-old woman with a 9-year history of bulimia and depression was taking fluoxetine 20 mg daily. A month later,about 2 days after smoking two 'joints 'of cannabis (marijuana), she experienced a persistent sense of well-being, increased energy,hypersexuality and pressured speech. These symptoms progressed into grandiose delusions, for which she was hospitalised. Her mania and excitement were controlled with lorazepam and perphenazine,and she largely recovered after about 8 days. The reasons for thisreaction are not understood but the authors of the report point outthat one of the active components of cannabis, dronabinol( 9-tetrahydrocannabinol), is, like fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of uptake. Thus a synergistic effect on central serotonergic neurones might have occurred.1This seems to be the first and only report of an apparent adverse interaction between cannabis and fluoxetine, but it emphasises the risks of concurrent use. 1. Stoll AL, Cole JO, Lukas SE. A case of mania as a result of fluoxetine-marijuana interaction. J Clin Psychiatry (1991) 52, 280 -1.Cannabis + Food No interactions found. Cannabis + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Cannabis + Irinotecan The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan are not altered by a herbal tea containing cannabis. Clinical evidence In a crossover study, 24 patients were given intravenous irinotecan 600 mg before and 12 days after starting a 15-day course of 200 mLdaily of a herbal tea containing SN-38 and SN-38G, were not significantly altered bythe presence of cannabis. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Irinotecan is metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, and this does not appear to be affected by oral cannabis. Importance and management This study suggests that cannabis taken orally will not affect the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan. No dosage adjustments are likely tobe needed if irinotecan is given with cannabis tea. It is not known if this applies to other drugs metabolised by CYP3A4, or to other preparations and routes of administration of cannabis, but see alsoCannabis + Ciclosporin, page 110, and Cannabis + Docetaxel,page 110. 1. Engels FK, de Jong FA, Sparreboom A, Mathot RAA, Loos the clinical pharmacokinetics irinotecan and docetaxel. Oncologist (2007) 12, The effects of transdermal nicotine and cannabis smoking on increasing the heart rate are additive, and nicotine increased thestimulant effect of cannabis. Combined use might increase theaddictive potential of both drugs. Clinical evidence In a study in 20 healthy subjects who smoked either a low-dose or a high-dose cannabis cigarette 4 hours after the application of a placebo or a 21 mg nicotine patch, nicotine enhanced the maximumincrease in heart rate seen with cannabis. The increase in heart ratefor nicotine alone was between 10 and 15 bpm, for cannabis alone 32and 42 bpm, for women and men, respectively, and, for thecombination, 45 and 58 bpm, respectively. In addition, the durationof tachycardia after smoking the low-dose cannabis was prolonged by 30 minutes by nicotine, but was not changed after the high-dose cannabis. Nicotine increased the subjective stimulant effects ofCannabis 111 Ccannabis, but the reported duration of effects of cannabis were shortened by nicotine. Plasma levels of nicotine and 9-tetrahy- drocannabinol (THC) did not differ on concurrent use. The cannabis cigarettes were standardised to 1.99% THC (low dose) and 3.51% THC (high dose).1 Experimental evidence Studies in mice found that nicotine enhanced the effects of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol in terms of hypolocomotion, hypothermia and antinociceptive responses. Somatic signs of withdrawal from 9-tetrahydrocannabinol were more severe in mice that had received nicotine.2 Mechanism Unknown. The additive effect on heart rate may be due to sympathetic activity of both drugs, and might also involvecannabinoid receptors. 1 Importance and management Cannabis is often smoked with tobacco. The findings of the clinical study show that transdermal nicotine has additive effects withcannabis on heart rate, and increased the stimulant effect ofcannabis. The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain. 1. Penetar DM, Kouri EM, Gross MM, McCarthy EM, Rhee CK, EN, Lukas SE.

Clinical evidence Four healthy subjects were given placebo or indometacin 25 mg three times daily for one day, and then a single-dose 2 hours before smoking cannabis 400 micrograms/kg on the following day. Indo- metacin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of 9-tetrahydrocanna- binol. Subjective measures of heart rate acceleration and intoxicationwere modestly attenuated by indometacin . Subjects also reported that the effects of marihuana on time perception were antagonised by indometacin .1 Experimental evidence In a study rabbits received placebo or 2% indometacin applied topically to both eyes one hour prior to an intravenous injection of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The fall in intraocular pressure caused by 9-tetrahydrocannabinol was inhibited by topical indometacin . In an animal model of analgesia, chronic treatment with 9-tetrahydrocannabinol markedly reduced the efficacy of aspirin , celecoxib (acetaminophen ).2 Mechanism It is suggested that prostaglandins have some part to play in some of the effects of cannabis, and that these are antagonised byindometacin, which is a prostaglandin inhibitor. 1,3Similarly, canna- bis antagonises the effects of NSAIDs.2 Importance and management The effects of indometacin on the subjective measures and intraocular pressure-lowering effects of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol are probably not of clinical significance. However, the relevanceof the finding that chronic use of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol might result in reduced efficacy and potency of NSAIDs requires furtherstudy.1.

Animal studies have shown that cannabinoids may enhance the potency of opioids. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A report of 3 patients with chronic pain (due to multiple sclerosis, HIV-related peripheral neuropathy and lumbar spinal damage) foundthat small smoked cannabis potentiated the antinociceptiveeffects of morphine . The patients were able to decrease the dose of opioid by 60 to 100%.1Studies in animals have shown that 9- tetrahydrocannabinol, the major psychoactive constituent of canna-bis, enhances low doses of 9-tetrahydro- cannabinol given with low doses of morphine may increase opioid potency without increasing adverse effects.5Cannabis use in methadone -maintained patients did not appear to affect treatment progress, although some psychological difficulties were slightly more prevalent.6However, other workers have suggested that heavy cannabis use is associated with poorer progress when methadone is given in the treatment of opioid addiction.7 1.

Cannabis + Phencyclidine The interaction between cannabis and phencyclidine is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Ananimal study found that pretreatment with cannabidiol signifi- cantly increased the levels of phencyclidine in the brain and blood of mice. Behavioural tests indicated that the increase in brain levels led to an increase in intoxication caused by phencyclidine. When the study was repeated using 9-tetrahydrocannabinol in doses of 120 mg/kg, the brain levels of phencyclidine were increased twofold.Lower doses of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol did not result in such an effect.1 Mechanism Unknown.112 Cannabis CImportance and management This preclinical study provides some evidence that cannabis might increase the abuse potential of phencyclidine. 1. Reid MJ, Bornheim LM. Cannabinoid-induced alterations in brain disposition of Biochem Pharmacol (2001) 61, 1357 -67. Cannabis + Phenytoin There is one in vitro study suggesting that 9-tetrahydrocanna- binol, a major constituent of cannabis, might induce phenytoinmetabolism. Note that, in clinical use dronabinol has inducedseizures. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an in vitro study in which human liver microsomes were incubated with phenytoin alone, or phenytoin and 9-tetrahydro- cannabinol, a major constituent of cannabis, the rate of metabolism of phenytoin was slightly increased in a dose-dependent manner.The rate of metabolism of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol to its 11-hydroxy metabolite was not altered by phenytoin.1 Various cannabinoids have shown antiepileptic effects in animal studies. In one study, the antiepileptic effect of phenytoin wasincreased when combined with cannabidiol. 2 Mechanism Thein vitro suggest that 9-tetrahydrocannabinol induces the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9.1 Importance and managementThis appears to be the only evidence that cannabis might affect phenytoin levels, and is only in vitro data. As such, it requires confirmation before any recommendations can be made. Note alsothat there are no reports in the literature of cannabis use affectingphenytoin levels. Note that oral dronabinol ( 9-tetrahydrocannabi- nol) has caused seizures in clinical use, and the manufacturerrecommends caution in those with a seizure disorder. 3 1. Bland TM, Haining A.

Cannabis + Protease inhibitors The short-term use of cannabis cigarettes or dronabinol (9-tetrahydrocannabinol) did not appear to adversely affect indinavir or nelfinavir levels or viral loads in HIV-positivepatients. Clinical evidence In 9 HIV-positive patients on a stable regimen containing indinavir (mostly 800 mg every 8 hours), smoking a cannabis cigarette (3.95% tetrahydrocannabinol) three times daily before meals for 14 days resulted in a median 14% decrease in AUC and maximum level anda 34% decrease in minimum indinavir level. However, only the change in maximum level was statistically significant.1Similarly, dronabinol ( 9-tetrahydrocannabinol) 2.5 mg three times daily for 14 days had no significant effect on indinavir pharmacokinetics.1 In another 11 patients on a stable regimen containing nelfinavir 750 mg three times daily, there was a non-significant 10% decreasein AUC, 17% decrease in maximum level and inminimum nelfinavir level after 14 days of cannabis cigarettes.1 Similarly, dronabinol 2.5 mg three times daily for 14 days had nosignificant effect on nelfinavir pharmacokinetics.1 There was no adverse effect on viral load or CD4 count in the patients receiving cannabis cigarettes or dronabinol.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism No mechanism expected.

Cannabis + Sildenafil Myocardial infarction occurred in a man who had smoked cannabis and taken a tablet of sildenafil. Clinical evidence A 41-year old man with no history of cardiac disease experienced a myocardial infarction after smoking cannabis and recreationallytaking a tablet of sildenafil (strength not specified). Later tests showed that he had no evidence of inducible ischaemia. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Myocardial infarction is a rare adverse effect of sildenafil alone. It was suggested that the metabolism of sildenafil by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 might be inhibited by constituents of cannabis such as cannabidiol, thereby increasing the risk of adverse events.However, in clinical studies, oral cannabis did not alter levels ofother CYP3A4 substrates. These included Cannabis + Irinotecan,page 111, and Cannabis + Docetaxel, page 110. Importance and management The vasodilatory effects of sildenafil necessitate caution in its use in patients with cardiovascular disease; myocardial infarction has rarely been associated with its use. The contribution of an interaction tothis case is unclear, but bear the possibility in mind in the event ofadverse effects on concurrent use. 1. McLeod AL, McKenna CJ, Northridge DB. Myocardial infarction (2002) 25, 133 smokers may need more theophylline thannon-smokers to achieve the same therapeutic benefits, becausethe theophylline is cleared from the body more quickly. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management One study found that tobacco or cannabis smoking similarly caused higher total clearances of theophylline (given as oral aminophylline) than in non-smokers (about 74 mL/kg per hour compared withCannabis 113 C52 mL/kg per hour), and that clearance was even higher (93 mL/kg per hour) in those who smoked both.1A later analysis by the same authors, of factors affecting theophylline clearance, found that smoking two or more joints of cannabis weekly was associated with a higher total clearance of theophylline than non-use (82.9 mL/kgper hour versus 56.1 mL/kg 2 Tobacco and cannabis smoke contain polycyclic hydrocarbons, which act as inducers of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2,and this results in a more rapid clearance of theophylline from thebody. Little is known about the effects of smoking cannabis on theophylline levels, but be alert for the need to increase thetheophylline dosage in regular users. Note that irregular cannabis usemight cause fluctuations in theophylline levels. 1.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A 21-year-old woman taking nortriptyline 30 mg daily experienced marked tachycardia (an increase from 90 to 160 bpm) after smoking a cannabis cigarette. It was controlled with propranolol.1A 26 year old complained of restlessness, dizziness and tachycardia (120 bpm) after smoking cannabis while taking imipramine 50 mg daily.2Four adolescents aged 15 to 18 taking tricyclic antidepressants for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder had transient cognitivechanges, delirium and tachycardia after smoking cannabis. 3 Increased heart rates are well-documented adverse effects of both the tricyclic antidepressants and cannabis, and what occurred wasprobably due to the additive beta-adrenergic and antimuscarinic effects of the tricyclics, with the beta-adrenergic effect of the cannabis. Direct information is limited but it has been suggested thatconcurrent use should be avoided. 1 1. Hillard JR, Vieweg WVR.

Constituents The pungent principles of capsicum are the capsaicinoids (towhich it may be standardised), present in concentrations up to 1.5%, but more usually around 0.1%. The major components are capsaicin, 6,7-dihydrocapsaicin, carotene, lutein), vitamins including A and C, and a small amount of volatile oil. Use and indications Capsicum possesses stimulant, antispasmodic, carminativeand counterirritant effects, which has led to its use inconditions such as colic and flatulent dyspepsia, and to increase peripheral circulation. Topical preparations are used for neuralgia including rheumatic pains and unbrokenchilblains. Capsicum is frequently eaten as part of the diet and, in particular, diets that contain spicy foods. It has beenestimated that the average consumption of dietary spicefrom capsicum fruit is 2.5 g/person per day in India and 5 g/person per day in Thailand. As the capsaicin content in capsicum fruit is approximately 1%, the daily dietary intakeof capsaicin may range from 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day for a 50 kg person. 1 Pharmacokinetics In vitro study suggests that many of the cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of capsaicinoids,by dehydrogenation, oxygenation, hydroxylation and O-demethylation. Principal isoenzymes thought to involved are CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and to some extent CYP3A4. Some metabolites of the capsaicinoids are thought to inhibit CYP2E1, 2and a study with phenazone, page 117, a probe drug for hepatic enzyme activity, suggests thatcapsaicin may inhibit hepatic enzymes, although the lack of interaction seen with theophylline, page 118, a substrate for CYP1A2, suggests that this isoenzyme is not signifi-cantly affected. A further in vitro study has shown that the acute use of capsaicin inhibits P-glycoprotein whereas long- term exposure induces P-glycoprotein, see digoxin, page 116. Interactions overview Capsicum has the potential to decrease the absorption of aspirin, increase the absorption of ciprofloxacin and theophylline, and alter the absorption of cefalexin anddigoxin. However, the clinical effects of these changes areunknown, not established or not clinically significant. Capsicum may also decrease the metabolism of pentobarbital and phenazone, but it does not alter the metabolism oftheophylline or quinine, which suggests that it has selectiveeffects on hepatic enzymes. 1.

Experimental evidence A study in rats given oral aspirin 20 mg/kg found that the acute administration of a standardised extract of Capsicum annuum 100 mg/kg (equivalent to 10 mg/kg capsaicin) reduced the AUC and maximum serum levels of salicylic acid by 44% and 26%,respectively. The effect was dose related, with a 300-mg/kg doseofCapsicum annuum reducing the AUC and maximum serum levels of salicylic acid by 59% and 51%, respectively. Similar, but greater,results were found when aspirin was given to rats that had been treated with Capsicum annuum extract for 4 weeks. 1 Mechanism It seems likely that capsaicin alters gastric motility, which reduces aspirin absorption and results in decreased salicylic acid levels.1 Importance and management Evidence is limited, but capsaicin appears to decrease aspirin bioavailability. However, the clinical significance of this effect is unclear, especially as the capsaicin dose used in the study is 10-foldgreater than the expected dietary intake in countries where a spicydiet is typically eaten, and many times higher than the expectedexposure if capsaicin is given as a cream, or ingested as a medicinalproduct. More study is needed before any clinical recommendationscan be made. 1. Cruz L, Casta\u00f1eda-Hern\u00e1ndez G, Navarrete A. Ingestion of chilli pepper (Capsicum annuum ) reduces salicylate bioavailability after oral aspirin administration in the rat. Can J Physiol Pharmacol (1999) 77, 441 -6. Capsicum + Cefalexin The interaction between capsicum and cefalexin is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study using animal tissue found that high concentrations of capsaicin instilled into ratintestines resulted in a lower rate of absorption of cefalexin. 1 MechanismIt was suggested that the capsaicin affected the transport channels in the intestine through which cefalexin is absorbed. 1 Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this study. Although the rate of cefalexin absorption was decreased the total amount of cefalexin absorbed was not studied, and therefore no conclusions can bedrawn on the possible clinical relevance of the findings. 1. Komori Y , Aiba T, Sugiyama R, Nakai C, Kawasaki H, Kurosaki Y. Effects of capsaicin on intestinal cephalexin absorption in rats. Biol Pharm Bull (2007) 30, 547 -51.Capsicum + Ciprofloxacin The interaction between capsicum and ciprofloxacin is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence A study in which ratswere given oral ciprofloxacin 20 mg/kg with placebo, or capsaicin in concentrations of 0.01%, 0.1%, 0.5% or 1%, found that the maximum levels and AUC of ciprofloxacin increasedwith increasing concentrations of or respectively. 1 Mechanism It is possible that the irritant nature of the capsaicin increased blood flow to the gastrointestinal absorption site or, alternatively, the rateof gastric emptying was increased, so ciprofloxacin reached theduodenum more quickly, where the pH enhances its absorption. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this study. The doses of the antibacterial and capsaicin were chosen to reflect those likely to be encountered clinically, and those encountered within dietary levels, respectively. Therefore if these findings are replicated in humans itseems possible that a clinically relevant rise in ciprofloxacin levelscould occur; however, given the magnitude of the rise, the effectseems most likely to be beneficial rather than adverse, althoughmore study is needed to establish this. 1. Sumano-L\u00f3pez H, Guti\u00e9rrez-Olvera L, Aguilera-Jim\u00e9nez R, Guti\u00e9rrez-Olvera C, Jim\u00e9nez-G\u00f3mez F.

Capsicum + Digoxin The interaction between capsicum and digoxin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an in vitro study, P-glycoprotein function was assessed by looking at the transport of digoxin, a known substrate of this transporter protein. In the presence of capsaicin the transport of digoxin acrosscells was enhanced, suggesting that capsaicin induces P-glycopro-tein. 1 Mechanism Capsaicin may induce P-glycoprotein. Importance and management Evidence is limited and difficult to extrapolate to a clinical situation. The study found that the acute use of capsaicin inhibitedP-glycoprotein, whereas long-term exposure induced P-glycopro-tein. Clinically, P-glycoprotein induction has resulted in reduceddigoxin absorption from the intestine and increased biliary excretion,the end result being a reduction in digoxin levels. Whether capsaicin would initially raise then subsequently lower digoxin levels remains to be established, but it may be prudent to consider the possibility ofthis effect if large doses of capsaicin are given systemically. 1. Han Y, Tan TMC, Lim L-Y. Effects of capsaicin in P-gp function and (2006) 71, 1727- 34.116 Capsicum CCapsicum + Food No interactions found. Capsicum is widely used as a spice in food. Capsicum + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Capsicum + Iron compounds Capsicum modestly reduces the absorption of dietary iron. Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study, 30 healthy women were given a standard Thai meal (fortified with about 4 mg of isotopically labelledferrous sulfate), with soup, to which 4.2 g of ground Capsicum annuum had been added. Capsicum annuum reduced iron absorption by about 38%. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Uncertain. It was thought that polyphenols in Capsicum annuum may inhibit iron absorption. Importance and management The study suggests that capsicum inhibits the absorption of dietary levels of iron. The levels of capsicum used were high, but they arenot unusual in a typical Thai meal. However, the effects of capsicumon iron supplementation (e.g. ferrous sulfate in doses of 200 mg)does not appear to have been studied, so it is difficult to predict theeffect of the use of capsicum as a herbal medicine on ironreplacement therapy. However, consider this interaction if a patient taking capsicum supplements has a poor response to iron replace- ment therapy. 1. Tuntipopipat S, Judprasong K, Zeder R, Walczyk T. Chili, but not turmeric, inhibits iron absorption in young women from an iron-fortified composite meal. J Nutr (2006) 136, 2970 -4. Capsicum + Pentobarbital The interaction between capsicum and pentobarbital is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a placebo-controlled study, rats were given a single 10-mg/kg subcutaneous dose of capsaicin followed 6 hours later by pento- barbital. The sleeping time of ratsin response to the pentobarbital was more than doubled by capsaicin.1 Mechanism It is thought that capsaicin may inhibit the cytochrome P450- mediated metabolism of pentobarbital. Importance and management Evidence is limited to this study in rats. If the findings are replicatedin humans it seems likely that capsaicin could increase the response to pentobarbital. Therefore if patients taking pentobarbital are givensystemic capsacicin it may be prudent to warn them that prolonged drowsiness may occur. 1. Miller MS, Brendel K, Burks IG. Interaction interaction between capsicum and phenazone is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a placebo-controlled study, rats were given capsaicin 25 mg/kg daily for 7 days, followed by a single 10-mg intravenous dose of phenazone. It was found that capsaicin increased the half-life ofphenazone by 28%, and increased the AUC of phenazone by 43%. 1 Mechanism Capsaicin inhibits the metabolism of phenazone by hepatic enzymes.1 Importance and management Evidence is limited to this study in rats. Although rises in phenazone levels of this magnitude may be of clinical relevance, the dose of capsicum used in the study was very high, so it seems unlikely thatthese effects would be reproduced with clinical or dietary quantitiesof capsaicin. 1.

Capsicum + Quinine The information regarding the use of capsicum with quinine isbased on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a placebo-controlled study, rats were given capsaicin 25 mg/kg daily for 7 days, followed by a single 25-mg/kg intravenous dose of quinine. It was found that capsaicin had no effect on thepharmacokinetics of quinine. 1 Mechanism No mechanism expected. Importance and management The available evidence suggests that no pharmacokinetic interaction would be expected between capsaicin and quinine. 1. Wanwimolruk S, Nyika S, Kepple M, Ferry DG, Clark CR.

Clinical evidence A study in 6 healthy subjects found that the absorption of theophylline 400 to 500 mg was increased after they ate a spicymeal, when compared with a European standard meal: the AUC and AUC 0-12were increased by 23% and 15%, respectively.1 Experimental evidence In a study, rabbits were given a single intravenous 12-mg/kg dose of theophylline either with a single dose of ground capsicum suspen- sion, or after 7 days of treatment with ground capsicum suspension.Capsicum did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, apartfrom a 40% increase in the elimination rate constant after the single dose of capsicum. 2 A previous study by the same authors found that a ground capsicum fruit suspension, given at the time of the theophylline dose and 11 hours later, increased the AUC of a 20-mg/kg oral dose oftheophylline, and increased peak theophylline levels by 33%. 3 In contrast, a placebo-controlled study in rats given capsaicin 25 mg/kg daily for 7 days followed by a single 10-mg/kg intravenousdose of theophylline, given as aminophylline, found that capsaicindid not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. 4 Mechanism Capsaicin has been shown in animal studies to increase mesenteric blood flow, which may result in increased absorption of theo- phylline.3 Importance and management The evidence suggests that capsaicin has only modest effects on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The clinical study found anincrease in the theophylline AUC of about 20%, which would not generally be expected to be clinically relevant. It would therefore appear that no specific additional precautions are necessary ifpatients taking theophylline also take capsaicin. 1. sur l 'absorption de la th\u00e9ophylline. 41, -71.

Constituents The main constituents of both the closely related species of cat's claw include the tetracyclic Quinovic acid glycosides have also been isolated. Note that there are two chemotypes of Uncaria tomentosa , one primarily containing the tetracyclic alkaloids, (iso)pteropo-dine and (iso)mitraphylline. Use and indications Cat's claw roots, bark and leaves have been used for gastric ulcers, arthritis, gonorrhoea, dysentry, herpes zoster, herpessimplex and HIV, and as a contraceptive. In various preclinical studies, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antirheu- matic, immunostimulating, antimutagenic, antitumour andhypotensive properties have been is evidence that the tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids antagonise the immunomodulating effects of the pentacyclic oxindolealkaloids, and some preparations for arthritis are standard-ised to contain little or no tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids.Other preparations are essentially free of oxindole alkaloids. In two in vitro studies,1,2alcoholic extracts of Uncaria tomentosa were found to be a potent inhibitors P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. Inhibitory effects onCYP2D6, of decreasing potency). 2It was suggested that Uncaria tomentosa might have the potential to interfere with the metabolism of substrates of CYP3A4,1but note that St John 's wort was an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in this study, whereas, clinically (multiple dose use), it is an inducer of CYP3A4. This serves as a reminder that in vitro studies cannot be directly extrapolated to the clinical situation, and that the findings need confirmation in a clinical setting. Interactions overview Cat's claw has some antiplatelet and antihypertensive effects, which may be additive to those of conventional drugs. Datafrom a clinical study suggest that cat 's claw may safely be given with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. An isol- ated case reports an increase in the levels of atazanavir, ritonavir and saquinavir in a patient also taking cat 's claw. 1. Budzinski JW, Foster BC, Vandenhoek S, Arnason JT.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Isorhynchophylline 10 mg/kg, a tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid from lower systolic arterial blood pressure, diastolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate by about 9%, 21% and 14%, respectively, in normotensive rats and about 9%, 6% and 19%, respectively, in hypertensive rats in an experimental study.1The effect appears to be dose dependent because isorhynchophylline 20 mg/kg, given via the duodenum,lowered the systolic pressure by about 25%, diastolic pressure by about 38% and heart rate by about 25% in normotensive rats.A similar effect was seen in dogs. 1 Mechanism It is suggested that the hypotensive effect is mainly due to a vasodilating effect and transient reduction in the heart rate and forceof cardiac contraction. 1Additive blood pressure-lowering effects with conventional antihypertensives might therefore occur. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to experimental data and an interaction is not established. Uncaria species are commonly used in traditional medicine for hypertension, and the preclinical evidenceshows that isorhynchophylline, a tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid fromcat's claw, not of Uncaria tomentosa contain isorhynchophylline, and some prepar- ations are specifically standardised not to contain this constituent, sonot all cat 's claw products will interact. Nevertheless, despite the lack of clinical evidence, there is the potential for an additive bloodpressure-lowering effect if cat 's claw containing isorhynchophylline is given with any antihypertensive. Concurrent use need not beavoided, but patients should be made aware of the possibility ofincreased antihypertensive effects. 1. Shi J-S, Liu G-X, Qin WU, Zhang W, Huang X-N. Hypotensive and hemodynamic effects of isorhynchophylline in conscious rats and anaesthetised dogs. Chin J Pharmacol Toxicol (1989) 3, 205 -10. Cat's claw + Antiplatelet drugs The interaction between cat's claw and antiplatelet drugs isbased on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence A study in rabbits 1found that rhynchophylline, a tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid from caused a concentration-dependent of platelet aggregation by up to about 78%. Rhynchophyl- line also inhibited venous thrombosis by up to about 70% in rats. Similar results were seen in a second experimental study in rats.2 Mechanism The authors suggest that the antiplatelet effect may be due to the suppression of the release of arachidonic acid (an inducer of plateletaggregation) from platelet reduction of products. 1,2Theoretically, additive antiplatelet effects are possible with antiplatelet drugs, which might increase the risk ofbleeding.Importance and management Evidence is limited to these experimental studies. Any interaction is complicated because not all varieties of Uncaria tomentosa contain rhynchophylline, and some preparations are specifically standardisednot to contain this constituent, so not all cat 's claw products will necessarily interact. What is known suggests that some cat 's claw products may possibly have antiplatelet effects, which may beadditive to conventional antiplatelet drugs. Concurrent use need notbe avoided (indeed combinations of antiplatelet drugs are oftenprescribed together) but it may be prudent to be aware of thepotential for increased bleeding if cat 's claw is given with other antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin andclopidogrel . Warn patients to discuss any episode of prolonged bleeding with a healthcareprofessional. 1. Chen C-X, Jin R-M, Li Y-K, Zhong J, Yue L, Chen Zhou Sin Jin RM, Chen CX, Li YK, Xu PK. 26, 246 -9. Cat's claw + Antirheumatics No additional adverse effects appear to occur when cat 's claw is taken with sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A cat 's claw preparation (without tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids) was used for 52 weeks in a small clinical study in patients taking sulfasalazine orhydroxychloroquine . There were no safety concerns from the use of the combination when compared with placebo, and a modest clinical benefit.1Although this study does not exclude the possibility of a drug interaction, it provides some evidence that cat 's claw can be combined with these established drugs without aproblem. 1. Mur E, Hartig F, Eibl G, Schirmer M. Randomized double blind trial of an extract from the pentacyclic alkaloid-chemotype of Uncaria tomentosa for the treatment J Rheumatol (2002) 29, 678 -81. Cat's claw + Food No interactions found. Cat's claw + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Cat's claw + Protease inhibitors An isolated case report describes raised atazanavir, ritonavir and saquinavir levels following the use of cat 's claw. Clinical evidence An HIV-positive woman awaiting liver transplantation, taking atazanavir 300 mg daily, ritonavir 100 mg daily and saquinavir 1 g daily, in combination with abacavir 600 mg daily and lamivudine 300 mg daily, was found to have an increased trough level of allthree protease inhibitors. Atazanavir trough levels were 1.22 mic- rograms/mL (expected range of 0.15 to 0.18 micrograms/mL), ritonavir trough levels were 6.13 micrograms/mL (expected levelCat's claw 121 Cof 2.1 micrograms/mL) and saquinavir trough levels were 3.4 mic- rograms/mL (expected range 0.1 to 0.25 micrograms/mL). Onfurther questioning, the patient reported no change in her compliance with the medication but reported that she been taking a herbal supplement containing cat 's claw for the previous 2 months. No evidence of protease inhibitor-related toxicity was found and thepatient reported no adverse effects. The supplement was stopped andby day 15 the levels of all three drugs had returned to within normallimits. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Anin vitro studies suggested that cat 's claw may inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, the main of atazanavir, ritonavir and saquinavir; however, the results of this study are questionable. See underPharmacokinetics, page 120. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to one case report from which it is difficult to draw general conclusions. What it illustrates is that moreresearch is needed into the use of cat 's claw with protease inhibitors. Patients taking drugs for serious conditions such as HIV infectionshould carefully consider the risks and benefits of adding herbalmedicines to their existing regimen, where the outcome ofconcurrent use is unknown. 1.

Other constituents present in chamomile include flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, rutin), its methyl ether, heniarin. Use and indications German chamomile is used for dyspepsia, flatulence andtravel sickness, especially when the gastrointestinal disturb- ance is associated with nervous disorders. It is also used for nasal catarrh and restlessness. German chamomile is widelyused in babies and children as a mild sedative, and to treat colic and teething pain. It has been used topically for haemorrhoids, mastitis and leg ulcers. Pharmacokinetics In vitro studies have found that a commercial ethanolic extract of Matricaria chamomilla and a crude Matricariarecutita essential oil extract inhibited the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4.1,2However, the effects were weak when compared with the known potent CYP3A4 inhibitorketoconazole. 2 A crude Matricaria recutita essential oil extract has also been found to moderately inhibit CYP1A2 in vitro.2 Similarly, a study using liver microsomes from rats pretreated with chamomile tea 2% for 4 weeks ( Vita Fit Nutrition , made from the dried flower heads of Matricaria chamomilla and Matricaria recutita ) found that CYP1A2 activity was reduced to 39%, when compared with thecontrol group. 3 A crude Matricaria recutita essential oil extract had no significant effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzymesCYP2C9 and CYP2D6. 2 For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in German chamomile, see under flavonoids, page 186.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A study in 13 healthy subjects found that chamomile tea (an infusion ofMatricaria chamomilla ) sweetened with panela (an unrefined cane sugar sweetener containing fructose) did not affect theabsorption of iron from an iron-fortified bread, when comparedwith the absorption of iron from the bread alone. 1The tannin content of the chamomile tea was reported to be 24.5 mg in 100 mL. This ismuch less than the tannin content of black tea, which is known toreduce iron absorption. See Tea + Iron compounds, page 386. Thislevel of tannins did not appear to affect iron absorption in thisparticular study and it would therefore appear that chamomile tea may be taken without impairing iron absorption. 1.

Chamomile, German + Warfarin A single case report describes a woman stabilised on warfarin who developed a marked increase in her INR with bleedingcomplications 5 days after she started using two chamomileproducts. Clinical evidence A 70-year-old woman stabilised on warfarin with an INR of 3.6 started drinking 4 to 5 cups of chamomile tea (an infusion ofMatricaria chamomilla ) daily for chest congestion, and using a chamomile-based skin lotion 4 to 5 times daily for foot oedema.About 5 days later she developed ecchymoses and was found to havean INR of 7.9, a retroperitoneal haematoma and other internalhaemorrhages. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism German chamomile contains the natural coumarin compounds, umbelliferone and heniarin, However, these compounds do notpossess the minimum structural requirements (a C-4 hydroxylsubstituent and a C-3 non-polar carbon substituent) required foranticoagulant activity. German chamomile essential oil extracts donot appear to significantly affect the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, the main isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of warfarin, but the effects of chamomile tea do not appear to have beenstudied. Importance and management This appears to be the first report of an interaction between warfarin and German chamomile. There seem to be no reports of Germanchamomile alone causing anticoagulation, and the natural coumarinconstituents of German chamomile do not appear to possess anticoagulant activity, which might suggest that the risk of an additive effect is small. Furthermore, a pharmacokinetic basis forthis interaction has not been established. Because of the many otherfactors influencing anticoagulant control, it is not possible to reliablyascribe a change in INR specifically to a drug interaction in a singlecase report without other supporting evidence. It may be better toadvise patients to discuss the use of any herbal products that they wish to try, and to increase monitoring if this is thought advisable. Cases of uneventful use should be reported, as they are as useful aspossible cases of adverse effects. 1. Segal R, Pilote L. Warfarin interaction with Matricaria chamomilla .CMAJ nobile (L.)

Angelica sinensis a series of phthalides ( n-butylidenephthalide, ligustilide, n-butylphthalide). Use and indications One of the most common uses of Chinese angelica root is forthe treatment of menopausal symptoms and menstrual disorders. It has also been used for rheumatism, ulcers, anaemia, constipation, psoriasis, the management of hyper-tension and to relieve allergic conditions.Pharmacokinetics Evidence is limited to experimental studies, which suggestthat the effects of Angelica dahurica andAngelica sinensis may not be equivalent. 1Most of the evidence relates to Angelica dahurica, which may inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9 (see tolbutamide, page 131), CYP2C19 (see diazepam, page 130) and CYP3A4 (seenifedipine, page 130). If all these effects are found to beclinically relevant then Chinese angelica (where Angelica dahurica is used) has the potential to raise the levels of a wide range of conventional drugs. Interactions overview Angelica dahurica may raise the levels of diazepam and tolbutamide, thereby increasing their effects. More limited evidence suggests that nifedipine may be similarly affected. Case reports suggest that Chinese angelica may increase thebleeding time in response to warfarin, and may possess oestrogenic effects, which could be of benefit, but which may also, theoretically, oppose the effects of oestrogenantagonists, such as tamoxifen. 1.

Jpn J Pharmacol (2001) 85, 399 - 408.C 129Chinese angelica + Diazepam The interaction between Angelica dahurica and diazepam is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats,1Angelica dahurica had little effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous diazepam 10 mg/kg. However, when diazepam 5 mg/kg was given orally, the AUC of diazepam wasmarkedly increased from levels below detection to detectable levels,and the maximum plasma level was increased fourfold. In a mobilitystudy, Angelica dahurica potentiated the muscle relaxant effects of intravenous diazepam. 1 Mechanism Inrats, diazepam is principally metabolised in the liver by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes including CYP2C19. It is thought that this isoenzyme is inhibited by Angelica dahurica . It was also suggested by the authors that there was a considerable effect ofAngelica dahurica on the first-pass metabolism of diazepam. 1 Importance and management Although the data are from animal studies, because of the potential for increased levels and effects of diazepam, until more is known it may be prudent to advise caution when giving Angelica dahurica with oral diazepam. Warn patients that they may experienceincreased sedation. Note that it may not be appropriate to extrapolate from Angelica dahurica to other species such as Angelica sinensis , since, in one study, Angelica sinensis had much less effect on CYP3A4 than Angelica dahurica , see under nifedipine, below. 1.

Chinese angelica + Food No interactions found. Chinese angelica + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Chinese angelica + Nifedipine The interaction between Chinese angelica and nifedipine is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study, ratswere given an extract of Angelica dahurica , and then ratliver microsomes were prepared and incubated with nifedipine. Angelica dahurica was found to inhibit the activity of nifedipine oxidase 1 to 6 hours after administration, by about 30 to 40%.1MechanismNifedipine oxidation is mediated by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. 1This activity of Angelica dahurica was shown to be related to furanocoumarin constituents. Other in vitro studies suggest that an alcoholic extract of Angelica dahurica more potently inhibited CYP3A4 than an aqueous decoction, whereasextracts of Angelica sinensis had no significant effect on CYP3A4. 2 Importance and management Evidence is limited to experimental studies, but what is known suggests that any CYP3A4 inhibitory effects of Chinese angelicadepend on the species and the type of extract used. The results are difficult to reliably extrapolate to the use of Chinese angelica with nifedipine in humans, but it is possible that alcoholic extracts ofAngelica dahurica may decrease nifedipine metabolism, and there- fore increase its levels and effects. Be aware of this possibility ifboth substances are given. 1. Ishihara K, Kushida H, Yuzurihara M, Wakui Y, Yanagisawa T, Kamei H, Ohmori S, Kitada M.

This may result in additive effects with oestrogens or it may oppose theeffects of oestrogens. Similarly, Chinese angelica may haveadditive effects with oestrogen antagonists or oppose the effectsof oestrogen antagonists (e.g. tamoxifen). Clinical evidence A letter in the Medical Journal of Australia 1draws attention to the fact that some women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy or hormone antagonists who develop menopausal symptoms havefound relief from hot flushes by taking a Chinese herb 'dong quai ' (or 'danggui 'root), which has been identified as Angelica sinensis .A possible explanation is that this and some other herbs (agnus castus,hops flower, ginseng root and black cohosh) have significantoestrogen-binding activity and physiological oestrogenic actions. 2 The oestrogenic potential of Chinese angelica is, however, somewhat unclear. A phytoestrogenic preparation containing soyextract 75 mg, black cohosh 25 mg and Angelica polymorpha (a species related to Chinese angelica) 50 mg taken twice daily reducedthe average frequency of menstrually-associated migraine attacks ina 15-week period 54% in a randomised, placebo-controlled studyin 42 women. 3The preparation used in this study was standardised to content of isoflavones from soy, ligustilide from Angelica polymorpha and triterpenes from black cohosh. In contrast, in another randomised, placebo-controlled study, Angelica sinensis root 4.5 g daily did not produce significant oestrogen-like responses inendometrial thickness or vaginal maturation and did not relievemenopausal symptoms in 71 postmenopausal women. 4TheAngelica sinensis preparation in this study was standardised to content of ferulic acid. Experimental evidence In various in vitro andanimal studies, Chinese angelica extract has been shown to inhibit the binding of estradiol to the oestrogen receptor and increase uterine growth (oestrogenic effects). However,it also decreased uterine c-myc mRNA levels (which is induced by oestrogens). 2 Mechanism If Chinese angelica has oestrogenic actions, which are not130 Chinese angelica Cestablished, then it might directly stimulate breast cancer growth and oppose the actions of competitive oestrogen receptor antagonistssuch as tamoxifen. See also Isoflavones + Tamoxifen, page 262. Importance and management One clinical study and the anecdotal cases mentioned in the letter suggest that Chinese angelica, either alone, or with otherphytoestrogens, may possess oestrogenic properties. In contrast, ina well-controlled study, Chinese angelica alone did not produceoestrogen-like responses. The concern is that, if Chinese angelicadoes have oestrogenic effects, it might stimulate breast cancer growth and antagonise the effects of hormone antagonists used to treat cancer. Until more is known, it may be prudent to avoid usingherbs with purported oestrogenic effects in women with oestrogen-sensitive cancers. This is more strictly a disease -herb interaction.

Chinese angelica + Tolbutamide The interaction between Angelica dahurica and tolbutamide is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study, ratswere given an extract of Angelica dahurica , and then ratliver microsomes were prepared and incubated with tolbutamide. Angelica dahurica was found to inhibit the activity of tolbutamide hydroxylase 1 to 6 hours after administration, by up to about 60%. In further experiments in rats, the AUC of intravenous tolbutamide 10 mg/kg was increased 2.5-fold by Angelica dahurica 1 g/kg.1 Mechanism Angelica dahurica inhibits activity of the cytochrome P450 CYP2C subfamily of isoenzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of tolbutamide.1 Importance and management Although there is a lack of clinical evidence, because of the potential for increased levels of tolbutamide, it may be prudent to exercisesome caution when using medicines containing Angelica dahurica in patients taking tolbutamide. Patients may wish to consider increas-ing the frequency of blood-glucose monitoring. It may not beappropriate to extrapolate from Angelica dahurica to other species such as Angelica sinensis , because in one study Angelica sinensis did not possess the same enzyme inhibitory properties as Angelica dahurica , see nifedipine, page 130. 1.

Interaction of drugs and chinese herbs: Pharmacokinetic changes of tolbutamide and diazepam caused by extract of Angelica dahurica .J Pharm Pharmacol (2000) 52, 1023- 9.Chinese angelica + Warfarin and related drugs Two case reports describe a very marked increase in the anticoagulant effects of warfarin when Chinese angelica was given. Clinical evidence A 46-year-old African -American woman with atrial fibrillation taking warfarin had a greater than twofold increase in her prothrombin time and INR after taking Chinese angelica for4 weeks. The prothrombin time and INR had returned to normal 4 weeks after stopping Chinese angelica. 1In another case, a woman who had been taking warfarin for 10 years developed widespread bruising and an INR of 10, a month after starting to take Chineseangelica. 2 A further report describes spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage in a 53-year-old woman not taking anticoagulants, which wasattributed to a herbal supplement containing Chinese angelica root 100 mg and a number of other herbs. See Red clover + Antic- oagulants, page 333. Experimental evidence In a study in rabbits , Chinese angelica aqueous extract 2 g/kg twice daily for 3 days significantly decreased the prothrombin time in response to a single 2-mg/kg dose of warfarin without altering theplasma warfarin concentrations. However, when the study was repeated with warfarin at steady state, prothrombin times tended to be increased after the addition of Chinese angelica, although, as withthe single-dose study, warfarin plasma levels were not significantlyaltered. 3In an in vitro study, Chinese angelica extract alone slightly increased prothrombin time.4 Mechanism The reasons for this interaction are not fully understood but Chinese angelica is known to contain natural coumarin derivatives, which may possibly have anticoagulant properties: these could be additivewith those of warfarin. However, note that many coumarins do nothave anticoagulant effects, see coumarins, page 297. The datasuggest that alteration of warfarin levels is not involved, but otherstudies suggest that the herb may inhibit the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2C9, which is the main route of warfarin metabol-ism. See tolbutamide, above. Importance and management Clinical evidence for an interaction between Chinese angelica and warfarin appears to be limited to the case reports cited, and aninteraction is not fully established. Nevertheless, it would seemprudent to warn patients taking warfarin, and possibly othercoumarin anticoagulants, of the potential risks of also taking Chinese angelica. For safety, the use of Chinese angelica should be avoided unless the effects on anticoagulation can be monitored.More study is needed. 1. Page RL, Lawrence JD. Potentiation of warfarin by dong quai.

Constituents Chitosan is a polysaccharide composed of polymers of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine. It is obtained from the partial deacetylation of chitin obtained from the shells ofcrustaceans such as shrimps and crabs. It is available indifferent molecular weights, viscosity grades and degrees ofdeacetylation. Use and indications Chitosan is used as a dietary supplement for obesity and hypercholesterolaemia. Pharmaceutically, chitosan and vari- ous derivatives are used, or being investigated, as excipientsin drug formulations including oral or nasal dosage formsand gene carrier systems.Pharmacokinetics Chitosan is an absorption enhancer and increases thepermeability of peptide drugs across intestinal and mucosalepithelia, which has implications for drug delivery systems. 1 A thiolated chitosan derivative is also reported to inhibit the activity of P-glycoprotein, which has possible applications for improving the bioavailability of P-glycoprotein sub-strates, 2but note that this derivative does not appear to be used as a dietary supplement. Interactions overview Chitosan appears to alter the rate of absorption of water-insoluble drugs such as indometacin and griseofulvin, but it is doubtful whether this is of any clinical significance. A case report suggests that chitosan may increase the effects ofwarfarin, and possibly other related anticoagulants. 1. Thanou M, Verhoef JC, Junginger HE.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence There was no significant difference in the AUC and maximum levels of cefalexin 10 mg/kg given alone, and when ratswere pretreated with oral chitosan 25 mg/kg.1 Mechanism Chitosan does not appear to alter the gastrointestinal absorption of water-soluble drugs such as cefalexin.1 Importance and management The evidence is limited to experimental data and the pharmaco- kinetics of cefalexin were unchanged. Therefore, no action isconsidered necessary. 1. Nadai M, Tajiri C, Yoshizumi H, Suzuki Y, Zhao YL, Kimura M, Tsunekawa Y, Hasegawa T.

Chitosan + Griseofulvin The information regarding the use of chitosan with griseofulvin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence The AUC 0-10and maximum levels of griseofulvin 50 mg/kg were both reduced by about two-thirds when rats were pretreated with oral chitosan 25 mg/kg. The time to reach maximum levels was also prolonged.1 Mechanism Little understood. The bioavailability of some formulations of griseofulvin are known to be enhanced when given with high-fatmeals because the high levels of bile salts increase the solubilisation of this water-insoluble drug. The authors suggest that, by binding to bile acids, chitosan inhibits this effect, which in turn affects thedissolution rate and the gastrointestinal absorption of griseofulvin. 1 This seems more likely than being due to a delay in gastricemptying, because chitosan did not alter the rate of absorption ofparacetamol, below. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to the experimental study cited above, which suggests that the rate of absorption of griseofulvin ismarkedly reduced by chitosan. Furthermore, the extent of absorptionmight be reduced, although the sampling time was not long enoughto conclude this. Making a clinical recommendation from these dataalone is therefore difficult. It could be argued that chitosan isunlikely to affect conventional micronised formulations of griseo- fulvin, which are well absorbed when taken with food. Until more is known, an alternative cautious approach would be to advise patientsto avoid chitosan while taking a course of griseofulvin, to minimisethe risk of reduced griseofulvin efficacy. 1.

Chitosan + Indometacin The information regarding the use of chitosan with indometacin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence There was no significant difference in the AUC and maximum levels of indometacin 10 mg/kg when rats were pretreated with oral chitosan 25 mg/kg, although the rate of absorption (time to reachmaximum levels) was prolonged. 1 Mechanism Little understood. The authors suggest that by binding to bile acids, chitosan inhibits the solubilisation and the gastrointestinal absorp- tion of indometacin, which is not water soluble. They suggest that the effect of chitosan is not due to a delay in gastric emptying,1 because it did not alter the rate of absorption of paracetamol, below. Importance and management The evidence is limited to experimental data and the extent of indometacin absorption was unchanged. Therefore, no action isconsidered necessary. 1.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence There was no significant difference in the AUC and maximum levels of paracetamol 30 mg/kg when rats were pretreated with oral chitosan 25 mg/kg.1 Mechanism Paracetamol absorption is dependent on the rate of gastric emptying, and it is often used to study this. The findings of this study suggestthat chitosan does not alter the gastric emptying rate. 1 Importance and management The evidence is limited to experimental data and the pharmaco-Chitosan 133 Ckinetics of paracetamol were unchanged. Therefore, no action is considered necessary. 1. Nadai M, Tajiri C, Yoshizumi H, Suzuki Y, Zhao YL, Kimura M, Tsunekawa Y, Hasegawa T.

Chitosan + Warfarin and related drugs An isolated report describes an increase in the INR of an elderly man taking warfarin when he also took chitosan. Clinical evidence A case report describes an 83-year-old man, with type 2 diabetes, who was receiving warfarin (2.5 mg daily for one year, with an INRof between 2 and 3) for atrial fibrillation. At a routine blood test hisINR was found to be about 3.7, and, although the dose of warfarinwas halved, 3 days later his INR was more than 9. On discussion, itwas established that he had recently started taking chitosan 1.2 g twice daily. He was advised to stop this supplement and was subsequently restablised on warfarin. About one month later, thepatient restarted the chitosan, which again resulted in a raised INR. 1Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Chitosan sulfate has been reported to have anticoagulant activity, but this has not been found with chitosan. The authors therefore suggest that chitosan impaired the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins,including vitamin K. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist and areduction in vitamin K would be expected to enhance its effects. Importance and management Evidence is limited to this case, and the mechanism is largely speculative; however, an interaction seems probable. The evidence istoo slim to forbid patients taking warfarin from also taking chitosan,but it would seem prudent to discuss the possible outcome andadvise an increase in the frequency of anticoagulant monitoring;measuring the INR after a few days of concurrent use seems reasonable. There appears to be no evidence regarding other anticoagulants, but, if the mechanism is correct, all vitamin Kantagonists ( coumarins andindanediones ) would be expected to be 1.

Interactions overview It has been suggested that cinnamon may interfere with the control of diabetes by conventional antidiabetic drugs, but controlled studies do not appear to support this suggestion.Cinnamon is a constituent of various Chinese herbal medicines, see under bupleurum, page 89, for information.C 136Cinnamon + Antidiabetics Although one study suggests that cinnamon may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effects of conventional antidiabetics, ameta-analysis of controlled studies suggests otherwise. Clinical evidence In a placebo-controlled study, patients with type 2 diabetes were given Cinnamomum cassia 1 g, 3 g or 6 g daily (total of 30 patients) for a total of 40 days in addition to their normal medications. 1Blood- glucose levels were decreased by 2.9 mmol/L, 2 mmol/L and3.8 mmol/L in the 1 g, 3 g and 6 g groups, respectively. Changes in blood-glucose levels were only significant at 20 days in the 6 g group (blood-glucose decreased by 2.8 mmol/L). No particularadverse effects were reported. 1 Experimental evidence A literature review found several animal studies that suggested that cinnamon may have blood-glucose-lowering properties,2but no direct interactions data were found. Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Evidence is limited. The study cited above, which was not designed to investigate a potential drug interaction, seems to suggest that cinnamon has the potential to enhance the blood-glucose-loweringeffects of conventional antidiabetic medication (unnamed). How-ever, recent meta-analysis of randomised controlled studies, 3which included the study cited above, found that cinnamon does not appearto improve the control of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (glycosylatedhaemoglobin, fasting blood glucose and lipids assessed). In general therefore, cinnamon would not be expected to markedly affect the control of diabetes with conventional antidia-betic drugs. If any effect does occur, it is likely to be picked up bystandard blood-glucose monitoring, as high doses of cinnamon onlyhad a significant effect on blood-glucose after 40 days of concurrent use. 1 1.

Pharmacopoeias Chocolate (USP 32 ); Cocoa Butter ( USP 32 ); Theobroma Oil (BP 2009 ). Constituents Cocoa seeds contain xanthine derivatives , principally theobromine (1% to 4%), with small amounts of caffeine (up to about 0.4%) and other alkaloids. They are also rich in flavonoids from the flavanol and procyanidin groups, mainly catechin and epicatechin and their polymers. The nibs (cotyledons) are a rich source of cocoa butter (theobroma oil), which contains oleic, stearic, palmitic and linoleic acids. Use and indications The seeds roasted and powdered are the source of cocoa,which is mainly used as a food (in chocolate). Medicinaluses include as a stimulant and as a diuretic; effects that can be attributed to the xanthine content. However, note that theobromine is a much weaker xanthine than caffeine. Cocoabutter is used as an emollient and pharmaceutical excipient. More recently, there has been interest in the possible beneficial effects of cocoa consumption on cardiovascularhealth, because of its high content of flavonoids. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of caffeine are discussed undercaffeine, page 97. In one study, caffeine absorption fromchocolate was slower with a lower maximum concentrationthan from capsules, whereas theobromine absorption was faster with higher maximum concentration than from capsules. 1For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in cocoa, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Although the use of cocoa supplements has been cautioned by some in diabetic patients, there seems little evidence to support this. Dark chocolate may slightly decrease blood pressure in hypertensive patients, but caffeine from cocoamay have the opposite effect. Famotidine and foods have noeffect, or only modest effects, on the absorption of flavanols from cocoa. Cocoa may reduce the absorption of iron. Cocoa contains small amounts of caffeine compared with some other caffeine-containing herbs. Although it contains high levels of theobromine, this has weak xanthine effects when compared with caffeine. Nevertheless, when taken in sufficient quantities, cocoa could produce levels of caffeinesufficient to cause interactions, see caffeine, page 97. For information on the interactions of individual flavo- noids present in cocoa, see under flavonoids, page 186. Ofparticular note are studies showing that cocoa flavanols,might have antiplatelet effects, and that these might be additive with aspirin, see Flavonoids + Anticoagulants or Antiplatelet drugs, page 188. 1.

Cocoa + Antidiabetics Although the use of cocoa supplements has been cautioned by some in diabetic patients, there seems little evidence to support this. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management The traditional advice in diabetes is to avoid or limit intake of chocolate. This is principally because of the high calorific value ofchocolate, and its high sugar content (particularly milk chocolates). In one study, an isomalt-based chocolate (about 45% w/w) had a lower glycaemic effect than a sucrose-based chocolate (about 45%w/w), which confirms the concerns regarding the sucrose content. 1 Conversely, in animal studies, cocoa extract containing high levels of procyanidins had beneficial effects on blood-glucoselevels. 2,3In addition, in one study in patients with untreated essential hypertension, an improvement in glucose and insulin responses wasfound during an oral glucose tolerance test, and a slightly lower fasting blood-glucose level was seen, after subjects ate 100 g of dark chocolate daily for 15 days (substituted for food of similar energyand macronutrient composition). This effect was not seen with 90 gof white chocolate daily. 4Taken together, the evidence suggests that cocoa in itself, and cocoa supplements, should not be a problem indiabetics and should not interfere with blood-glucose control. 1.

Hypertension (2005) 46, 398 - 405. Cocoa + Antihypertensives Dark chocolate may slightly decrease blood pressure in hypertensive patients, but caffeine from cocoa may have theopposite effect. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management There has been some interest in the possible beneficial effects of cocoa consumption on cardiovascular health, because of its highcontent of flavonoids. In a meta-analysis of five short-termrandomised controlled studies, daily consumption of high doses(46 to 100 g daily) of dark chocolate, or 105 g daily of milkchocolate, all containing high levels of flavonoids, caused a modest 4.7 and 2.8 mmHg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. 1Another study with a lower dose (6.3 g daily) showed a smaller effect (2.9/1.9 mmHg reduction).2 These studies show that high doses of dark chocolate 100 g daily modestly decrease blood pressure, an effect attributed to its flavonoid content.1-3This suggests that blood pressure control is unlikely to be significantly affected by cocoa supplements in patients with hypertension. None of the patients in these studies was taking antihypertensive medication so some caution would still be needed.Theoretically, the caffeine content in cocoa could result in increasesin blood pressure, and therefore large quantities of cocoa supple-ments could be inadvisable in patients with hypertension, see Caffeine + Antihypertensives, page 99. 1.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in 6 healthy subjects, a single 20-mg dose of famotidine given one hour before consumption of sugar-free, flavanol-richcocoa had no effect on the AUC of flavanols. 1It was concluded that alteration of gastric pH had no effect on flavanol absorption. No special precautions appear to be necessary. 1. Schramm DD, Karim M, Schrader HR, Holt RR, Kirkpatrick NJ, Polagruto JA, Ensunsa JL, Schmitz HH, Keen CL. Food effects on the absorption and pharmacokinetics of cocoa flavanols. Life Sci (2003) 73, 857 -69. Cocoa + Food Food has no effect, or only modest effects, on the absorption of flavanols from cocoa. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a series of studies in 6 healthy subjects, high-carbohydrate foods (bread orsugar ) increased the flavanol AUC by 40% after consumption of 125 micrograms/kg of sugar-free, flavanol-rich cocoa. Lipid and protein-rich foods ( butter orsteak ) and whole milk had little effect on flavanol absorption. Grapefruit juice had a minor effect (20% increase), which was attributed to its carbohydratecontent. 1 This study demonstrated that carbohydrates can increase oral flavanol absorption from cocoa. However, the extent is modest, and probably of little clinical relevance. 1. Schramm DD, Karim M, Schrader HR, Holt RR, Kirkpatrick NJ, Polagruto JA, Ensunsa JL, Schmitz HH, Keen CL. Food effects on the absorption and pharmacokinetics of cocoa flavanols. Life Sci (2003) 73, 857 -69. Cocoa + Herbal medicines The caffeine content of cocoa suggests that it may interact with other herbal medicines in the same way as caffeine, see Caffeine + Herbalmedicines; Bitter orange, page 101, and Ephedra + Caffeine,page 176. Cocoa + Iron compounds Cocoa may reduce the absorption of iron.140 Cocoa CClinical evidence In a study in 10 healthy subjects1a 275 mL serving of cocoa beverage reduced the absorption of radiolabelled iron from a 50 g bread roll by about 70%. In this study, the inhibitory effect of cocoabeverage on iron absorption was only slightly less that of black tea (Assam tea, Camellia sinensis ). Note that black tea is known to inhibit iron absorption, see Tea + Iron compounds, page 386. Experimental evidence No relevant data found.MechanismThe polyphenols in cocoa may bind to iron in the gastrointestinal tract and reduce its absorption. 1 Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study, but be aware that some beverages such as cocoa might reduce iron absorptionsimilarly to conventional tea. See Tea + Iron compounds,page 386, for further discussion of the possible impact of thisinteraction. 1. Hurrell RF, Reddy M, Cook JD.

Pharmacopoeias Ubidecarenone ( BP 2009 Capsules ). indications Coenzyme Q 10is a naturally occurring enzyme co-factor that has a fundamental role in electron transport in mitochondria, and is also an antioxidant. It is often taken orally as asupplement to aid in the treatment of cardiovasculardisorders such as congestive heart failure, angina and hypertension. It has also been used to maintain the levels of endogenous coenzyme Q 10during treatment with con- ventional drugs that reduce these, particularly the statins. Coenzyme Q 10has also been used alongside treatment forbreast cancer, Huntington 's disease and Parkinson 's disease, and may help to prevent migraines. Pharmacokinetics The absorption of coenzyme Q 10is relatively slow and is dependent on postprandial lipids in the gastrointestinal tract,see food, page 143. Interactions overview Coenzyme Q 10did not interact with warfarin in a controlled study, but there are a few isolated reports describing eitherincreased or decreased warfarin effects in patients taking coenzyme Q 10. Coenzyme Q 10may decrease the effects of aldosterone and alter the levels of the major cytotoxic metabolite of doxorubicin. Pepper ( Piper nigrum ) of coenzyme Q 10.C 142Coenzyme Q 10+ Aldosterone The interaction between coenzyme Q 10and aldosterone is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In experimental studies in ratsanddogs, single-dose coenzyme Q 10 increased the sodium reabsorption stimulated by exogenous aldosterone, but, in contrast, in rats and dogs pretreated for 3 weeks with multiple doses, increasing the dose of coenzyme Q 10 reduced the sodium reabsorption caused by aldosterone. Potassium excretion remained unaffected throughout.1 This study suggests that long-term use of coenzyme Q 10might have some diuretic activity, and might oppose the effects of aldosterone. However, the clinical relevance of this is uncertain. 1. Igarashi T, Kobayashi M, Sugiyama K, Sagami F, Ohtake S. Effect of coenzyme Q10 on electrolyte metabolism and the interaction with aldosterone in rats and dogs. Proc West Pharmacol Soc (1975) 18, 399 -402. Coenzyme Doxorubicin The interaction between coenzyme Q 10and doxorubicin is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in rats, oral coenzyme Q 1020 mg/kg for 6 days had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous doxo- rubicin 10 mg/kg or its major cytotoxic metabolite doxorubicinol. However, there was a twofold increase in the AUC of the doxorubicinolone metabolite.1The findings from this study suggest that coenzyme Q 10is unlikely to reduce the efficacy of doxorubicin via a pharmacokinetic mechanism. The reason for the significant risein doxorubicinolone concentration and its impact is unknown. Notethat the possible use of coenzyme Q 10to reduce doxorubicin- induced cardiotoxicity has been investigated. 1. Zhou Q, Chowbay B. Effect of coenzyme Q 10on the disposition of doxorubicin in rats. Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet (2002) 27, 185 -92. Coenzyme Q 10+ Food The interaction between coenzyme Q 10and food is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Food increased the maximum serum levels and AUC of oral coenzyme Q 1025 mg/kg, given as an emulsion, by about fivefold and twofold respectively in rats. Coenzyme Q 10given as an emulsion showed greater increases than coenzyme Q 10given in suspension.1 Mechanism Coenzyme Q 10has a large molecular weight and is relatively hydrophobic, which results in slow absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Taking the supplement with food and/or as a lipid-basedemulsion increases its water solubility and enhances its absorption. Importance and management Data regarding the effects of food on coenzyme Q 10absorption appear to be limited. The absorption of coenzyme Q 10is relatively slow and is dependent on postprandial lipids in the gastrointestinaltract. Coenzyme Q 10supplements therefore often contain a lipid vehicle and it is recommended that they are taken with fatty meals.2 1. Ochiai A, Itagaki S, Kurokawa T, Kobayashi Hirano T, Iseki K.

Herbal medicines; Pepper Pepper ( Piper nigrum ) may modestly increase the levels of coenzyme Q 10. Clinical evidence In a single-dose, placebo-controlled study in 12 healthy subjects, there was no change in pharmacokinetics of coenzyme Q 10(AUC and maximum level or time to maximum level) when piperine 5m g (Bioperine ) from given with coenzyme Q1090 mg. Similarly, giving piperine 5 mg with coenzyme Q 10 90 mg daily for 14 days did not alter the AUC of coenzyme Q 10. However, when piperine 5 mg was given with coenzyme Q 10 120 mg daily for 21 days, the plasma levels of coenzyme Q 10were increased by 32% and the AUC was increased by 30%.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It was suggested that piperine increased the absorption of coenzyme Q10from the gastrointestinal tract, but the exact mechanism is unclear. Importance and management The modest increase in coenzyme Q 10levels seen in this study with piperine (an alkaloid derived from black pepper) is unlikely to be clinically important, since coenzyme Q 10is a ubiquitous compound, generally regarded as safe. Note that a combination product has beenmarketed. 1. Badmaev V, Majeed M, Prakash L. Piperine derived from black pepper increases the plasma levels of coenzyme Q10 following oral supplementation. J Nutr Biochem (2000) 11, -13. Coenzyme Q 10+ Warfarin and related drugs Ubidecarenone did not alter the INR or required warfarin dosein a controlled study in patients stabilised on warfarin. However,two reports describe reduced anticoagulant effects of warfarin in four patients taking ubidecarenone. A transient increase in INR has been reported in one patient taking ubidecarenone andwarfarin. A 4-month prospective, longitudinal study describesan increased beeding events in patientstaking 10with warfarin. Clinical In a in 21 patients stabilised 10100 mg daily ( Bio-Quinone ) for 4 weeks did not alter the INR or the required dose of warfarin, when compared with placebo.1Similarly, 2 patients taking coenzyme Q 10to treat alopecia caused by warfarin treatment did not have any notablechanges in INR, except that one had a transient INR increase when coenzyme Q 10was started.2 In a 4-month prospective, longitudinal study of 78 patients taking warfarin and a herbal product or dietary supplement, there was astatistically significant increased risk of self-reported bleedingCoenzyme Q 10 143 Cevents in 14 patients taking warfarin and coenzyme Q 10(57 bleeding events, none major, in a total of 181 weeks of combined use for an odds ratio of 3.7).3There were 4 elevated INRs (specific values not given) for 55 weeks of combined use, but this was not a statisticallysignificant increase in risk. Note that the coenzyme Q 10products used were not mentioned. The authors acknowledge that theirfinding might be due to chance and not a true interaction. In contrast, another report describes 3 patients taking warfarin who had a reduction in their INR while taking coenzyme Q 10. In two of these, INR reductions from about 2.5 to 1.4 occurred when theytook coenzyme Q 1030 mg daily for 2 weeks. The INRs rapidly returned to normal when the coenzyme Q 10was stopped.4In two other cases, patients appeared to have a reduced response to warfarinwhile taking coenzyme Q 10, but responded normally when it was stopped.5,6 Experimental evidence In a study in rats, coenzyme Q 10reduced the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and increased the clearance of both enantiomers of warfarin.7 Mechanism Not known. Coenzyme Q 10may have some vitamin K-like activity, which would explain the decrease in INR. Explanations for the increase in bleeding or INRs are unknown.Importance and management The well-controlled study suggests that coenzyme Q 10does not interact with warfarin, and that no warfarin dose adjustment would be expected to be necessary in patients who take this substance.However, the contrasting findings of a decrease in warfarin effect in the case reports, and an increase in bleeding events reported in the epidemiological study, introduce a note of caution. Moreover, theauthors of the controlled study recommend close monitoring of theINR if a patient decides to use coenzyme Q 10, because the underlying health problem resulting in them choosing to take thissubstance may alter their response to warfarin. 1Until more is known it would seem prudent to increase the frequency of INR monitoring in patients taking warfarin if coenzyme Q 10is started. 1.

(Rubiaceae) Synonym(s) related species Arabian coffee is from Coffea arabica. Robusta coffee is from Coffea canephora (Pierre ex Froehner) also known as Coffea robusta (Linden ex De Wild.). Other species include Coffea liberica . Constituents The kernel of the dried coffee bean contains xanthine derivatives, the main one being caffeine (1 to 2%), with some theobromine and theophylline. It also contains polyphenolic acids such as chlorogenic acids and variousditerpenes (e.g. kahweol, cafestrol). Use and indications Coffee has been used as a stimulant and diuretic. However, when roasted, coffee beans are most commonly used as a beverage. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of caffeine are discussed undercaffeine, page 97. Evidence suggests that chlorogenic acidis hydrolysed in the gastrointestinal tract to free is then conjugated to form the glucuronate orsulphate. 1 Interactions overview Coffee contains significant amounts of caffeine, so theinteractions of caffeine, page 97, are relevant to coffee, unless the product is specified as decaffeinated. By virtue of its caffeine content, coffee may also cause serious adverseeffects if used with other drugs or herbs with similar effects,such as ephedra, page 176. Evidence is conflicting, but in general the long-term use of coffee does not appear to be detrimental to the control of diabetes; however, coffee mayhave a small adverse effect on blood pressure control. Coffeemay reduce the absorption of iron and the absorption of nicotine from chewing gum, but does not appear to affect the absorption of aspirin or tetracycline. A case report describesmania in a patient who drank coffee and took phenylpro- panolamine. For the possible increase in clozapine effects with caffeine, sometimes from coffee, see Caffeine +Clozapine, page 100. 1. Nardini M, Cirillo E, Natella F, Scaccini C.

J Agric Food Chem (2002) 50, 5735 -41.C 145Coffee + Antidiabetics Evidence is conflicting, but in general the long-term use of coffee does not appear to be detrimental to the control of diabetes. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management There is a lot of epidemiological evidence that coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (this has been thesubject of a review 1). In addition, a large prospective cohort study in Finland found that coffee drinking was associated with reduced total and cardiovascular disease mortality.2 In contrast, some short-term randomised studies have found that coffee consumption had detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects (high consumption of filtered coffee over 4 weeks)3 and increased postprandial hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2diabetes taking unnamed oral antidiabetic drugs (caffeine added todecaffeinated coffee, single dose). 4 The evidence is not conclusive, which makes it difficult to advise patients taking antidiabetics on use of coffee beverages or supple-ments. However the Finnish study does provides some reassurancethat use of coffee may not be detrimental in the long term, and mayeven be beneficial. 1. van Dam RM.

Coffee + Antihypertensives Coffee may have a small adverse effect on blood pressure control. Clinical evidence Limited data are available on the effect of coffee on blood pressure in patients taking antihypertensives. In one study, two 150-mL cupsof coffee (made from 24 g of coffee) increased the mean bloodpressure of 12 healthy subjects taking propranolol 240 mg, metoprolol 300 mg or a placebo. Mean blood pressure rises were 7%/22% with propranolol , 7%/19% with metoprolol and 4%/16% with placebo. The beta blockers and placebo were given in divideddoses over 15 hours before the test. 1However, there are lots of short- term studies on the effect of coffee on blood pressure in healthysubjects or patients with untreated mild hypertension. In one meta-analysis of 18 randomised studies of coffee consumption, coffeedrinking was associated with a very small 1.22/0.49 mmHg increase in blood pressure. 2 One study found that blood pressure was higher in untreated hypertensives who drank coffee (5 cups daily, each containing approximately 60 mg caffeine) than in untreated hypertensives whodid not drink coffee. However, coffee drinking reduced thepotentially detrimental post-meal postural drop in systolic bloodpressure in patients taking unnamed antihypertensives. 3 The only long-term studies are of epidemiological type. In one large prospective cohort study in Finland, low-to-moderate dailyconsumption of coffee (2 to 7 cups daily) was associated with asmall (about 24 to 29%) increased risk of requiring antihypertensivedrug treatment. 4In the Nurses Health prospective cohort, coffee consumption was not associated with an increased risk of developinghypertension. 5 In contrast to some of the data on coffee, chlorogenic acids from coffee have been reported to reduce blood pressure. In onerandomised study in patients with mild hypertension not receivingantihypertensives, green coffee bean extract 480 mg (containing 140 mg of chlorogenic acids) daily for 12 weeks was associated witha 10/7 mmHg reduction in blood pressure. 6A dose-related decrease in blood pressure with green coffee extract was seen in anotherstudy. 7Note that green coffee is not roasted, and may therefore contain different constituents and have different effects than theusual roasted coffee, although the importance of this remains to bedemonstrated. Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Acute intake of caffeine raises blood pressure, but partial tolerance to this effect might possibly develop with regular consumption, seealso Caffeine + Antihypertensives, page 99. Polyphenolic com-pounds in coffee might improve endothelial function, and might therefore lower blood pressure. Importance and management The evidence presented here is conflicting; however, most of the studies suggest that coffee might have a small adverse effect onblood pressure. It is possible that this does not extend to green(unroasted) coffee, and therefore supplements containing greencoffee extract might not be expected to have a negative effect on blood pressure. Further study is needed. For discussion of the adverse effect of caffeine on blood pressure, see Caffeine + Antihypertensives, page 99. 1. Smits P, Hoffmann H, Thien T, Houben H, van 't Laar A.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A study in 5 healthy subjects found that 200 mL of coffee had no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of a single 500-mg dose ofaspirin, whereas 200 mL of milk reduced the bioavailability andmaximum concentration of salicylates from the same dose of aspirinby a modest 30%. 1 No significant reduction in the bioavailability of aspirin would be expected with black coffee; however the addition of milk, dependingon the quantity, may possibly reduce the absorption of aspirin. Note that caffeine may enhance the analgesic effects of aspirin, see Caffeine + Aspirin or Diclofenac, page 99. 1. Odou P, Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my C, Robert H. Influence of seven beverages on salicylate disposition in humans. J Clin Pharm Ther (2001) 26, 187 -93. Coffee + Food No specific interactions found; however, the effects of caffeine from146 Coffee Ccoffee or a coffee-containing herbal medicine will be additive to those of other caffeine-containing foods or beverages. Coffee + Herbal medicines The caffeine content of coffee suggests that it may interact with other herbal medicines in the same way as caffeine, see Caffeine + Herbal medicines; Bitter orange, page 101, and Ephedra + Caffeine,page 176. Coffee + Iron compounds Coffee may possibly contribute towards the development of iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnant women, and reduce the levels ofiron in breast milk. As a result their babies may also be irondeficient. Clinical evidence In a series of studies in healthy subjects, drinking 200 mL of coffee with various test meals containing radiolabelled iron resulted in a39% to 83% reduction in the absorption of iron. No decrease wasobserved if the coffee was drunk one hour before the meal, but whenthe coffee was given one hour after the meal the reduction was thesame as taking it simultaneously with the meal. With one meal, the effect of coffee was about half that of tea. 1In another study, a 275 mL serving of instant coffee reduced the absorption of radiolabelled iron from a 50 g bread roll, and this was not affectedby milk. 2 A controlled study among pregnant women in Costa Rica found that coffee consumption was associated with reductions in thehaemoglobin levels and haematocrits of the mothers during preg- nancy, and of their babies shortly after birth, despite the fact that the women were taking ferric sulfate 200 mg and 500 micrograms of folate daily. The babies also had a slightly lower birth weight(3189 g versus 3310 g). Almost a quarter of the mothers wereconsidered to have iron-deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin levels ofless than 11 g/dL), compared with none among the control group ofnon-coffee drinkers. Levels of iron in breast milk were reduced byabout one-third. The coffee drinkers drank more than 450 mL of coffee daily, equivalent to more than 10 g of ground coffee. 3 In a randomised study in Guatemalan infants, discontinuing coffee intake in those given an iron supplement led to a greater increase in serum ferritin than continuing coffee consumption(median 891 mL weekly). However, discontinuing coffee had noeffect on changes in haemoglobin. 4 Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism It is suggested that polyphenolics in coffee might interfere with the absorption of iron.4 Importance and management The general importance of these findings is uncertain, but be aware that coffee consumption may contribute to iron-deficiency anaemia.Note that coffee is not generally considered to be a suitable drink forbabies and children, because of its effects on iron absorption.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in 8 otherwise healthy smokers, intermittent mouth rinsing with coffee substantially reduced salivary pH and nicotine absorp-tion from nicotine polacrilex gum. 1Buccal nicotine absorption is best in an alkaline environment, which is provided by the bufferingagents in the nicotine gum. Consumption of coffee reduces the pHand therefore nicotine absorption. 1The reduction in the absorption of buccal nicotine would apply only to beverages that affect buccal pH. Drinking coffee beverages during or immediately before nicotine gum use might therefore decrease the efficacy of thisform of nicotine replacement therapy. See also Caffeine + Nicotine,page 103. 1.

Coffee + Phenylpropanolamine A case report describes mania in a patient who drank coffee andtook phenylpropanolamine. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A case report describes mania with psychotic delusions in a healthy woman (who normally drank 7 to 8 cups of coffee daily) within3 days of her starting to take a phenylpropanolamine-containingdecongestant. She recovered within one week of stopping both thecoffee and the phenylpropanolamine. 1This appears to be the only case report of an adverse interaction specifically between coffee andphenylpropanolamine. However, case reports have described other severe reactions with caffeine, see Caffeine + Phenylpropanolamine, page 103. 1. Lake CR. Manic psychosis after coffee and phenylpropanolamine. Biol Psychiatry (1991) 30, 401 -4. Coffee + Tetracycline Coffee does not appear to affect the absorption of tetracycline. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A study in 9 healthy subjects found that 200 mL of coffee (milk content, if any, unstated) did not significantly affect the bioavail- ability of a single 250-mg dose of tetracycline.1 Milk is well known to decrease the absorption of tetracyclines, and a study in 12 healthy subjects found that 16 mL of evaporated milk added to 200 mL of coffee still significantly reducedtetracycline absorption (by roughly half). 2From the first study, it appears that coffee alone does not affect tetracycline absorption. 1.

Constituents Cola seed contains xanthine derivatives, mainly caffeine (1.5 to 3%) to which it may be standardised, with traces of theobromine and theophylline. Other constituents include flavonoids from the flavanol group (such as catechin and epicatechin), amines, an anthocyanin pigment (kola red) and betaine. Use and indications The main use of cola seed is as a stimulant for depression, tiredness and poor appetite, and as a diuretic. Both uses canbe attributed to the caffeine content. Cola is also used asflavouring agent in the manufacture of soft drinks. Pharmacokinetics For the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, see caffeine, page 97.For information on the pharmacokinetics of individualflavonoids present in cola, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Cola contains significant amounts of caffeine, therefore theinteractions of caffeine, page 97, should be applied to cola,unless the product is specified as decaffeinated. By virtue of its caffeine content cola may also cause serious adverse effects if used with other drugs or herbs with similar effects,such as ephedra, page 176. Cola may reduce the bioavail- ability of halofantrine and increase the risk of developing hypertension. For information on the interactions of indi-vidual flavonoids present in cola, see under flavonoids,page 186. Carbonated cola beverages are acidic, and they can therefore interact with drugs by altering gastric acidity. Thebest example of this is that they can increase the absorptionof the azole antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itraconazole. However, this mechanism is not going to be applicable to herbal medicines containing cola extracts, and these inter-actions are not therefore covered here.C 148Cola + Antihypertensives Cola appears to modestly increase the risk of developing hypertension. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management There is a possibility that the effect of cola on blood pressure might differ from that of pure caffeine. There appear to be very fewpublished studies of the effect of cola on blood pressure; however, inthe Nurses Health prospective cohort studies, both sugared cola and diet cola beverages were associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension with increased intake. 1Whether patients taking antihypertensives should limit their intake of cola is unclear.However, the modest hypertensive effects of the caffeine content ofcola may be of importance. See Caffeine + Antihypertensives,page 99, for further discussion of the adverse effect of caffeine onblood Habitual and the risk of hypertension in women. JAMA (2005) 294, 233 -5. Cola + Food No interactions found. Cola is used as a flavouring in carbonateddrinks. Note that the effects of caffeine from cola-containing herbal medicine or supplement will be additive with those of other caffeine-containing foods or beverages. Cola + Halofantrine Cola appears to moderately reduce the bioavailability ofhalofantrine.Clinical evidence In a study in 15 healthy subjects, a single 500-mg dose of halofantrine was given alone or with cola 12.5 g. Cola significantlyreduced the maximum concentration and AUC of halofantrine by45% and 31%, respectively. The overall clearance of halofantrine was reduced by 50%. Similar reductions were seen in the major metabolite of halofantrine, N-desbutylhalofantrine. No adverse effects were reported. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The authors suggest that caffeine, or other consituents of cola such as catechins or tannins, may have formed a complex withhalofantrine to reduce its absorption. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study, which found a modest reduction in the bioavailabilty of halofantrine. However, the bioavailability of halofantrine can vary widely between patients. Nevertheless, as there is the potential that this interaction could leadto malaria treatment failure, it may be prudent to advise patients toavoid taking cola during treatment with halofantrine. 1. Kolade CP, of the antimalarial drug halofantrine. Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2008) 64, 77-81. Cola + Herbal medicines The caffeine content of cola suggests that it may interact with otherherbal medicines in the same way as caffeine, see Caffeine + Herbalmedicines; Bitter orange, page 101, and Ephedra Coughwort, Farfara, Foal' s foot. Constituents The leaves and flowers of coltsfoot contain mucilage composed of polysaccharides, which include arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose and present, and sesquiterpenes including bisabolene derivatives and tussilagone may also be found. All parts of the plant maycontain the pyrrolizidine alkaloids isotussilagine, senecio-nine, senkirkine and tussilagine in variable amounts. These are toxic but chemically very labile, and may be absent from some extracts. Use and indications Coltsfoot is traditionally used in cough and cold preparationsas a demulcent and expectorant, and it is used in thetreatment of asthma. Extracts have anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic activity and tussilagone alone has been found to be a cardiovascular and respiratory stimulant. Theconcentration of the most toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid, senkirkine, is thought to be too low to cause toxicity if used infrequently, and tussilagine is unsaturated and there-fore less toxic. However, care should be taken withprolonged use. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions Coptis chinensis and coptisine. Use and indications Coptis species are used widely in Chinese medicine forinfections, especially of the digestive tract, and for similarreasons as bloodroot, page 76 and berberis, page 61. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. For information on the pharmacokinetics of the alkaloid constituent, berberine, see under berberine, page 58. Interactions overview No interactions with coptis found. However, for theinteractions of oxycoccus ) ( USP 32 ). Constituents contain anthocyanins citric, quinic and benzoic acids. Note that, although salicylic acid does not appear as a constituent of the juice in many cranberry monographs, somestudies have shown low levels of salicylates in commercial cranberry juice (e.g. 7 mg/L), which resulted in detectable plasma and urine levels of salicylic acid in women whodrank 250 mL of cranberry juice three times daily. 1 Use and indications The main use of cranberries and cranberry juice is for theprevention and treatment of urinary tract infections, althoughthey have also been used for blood and digestive disorders. Cranberries are commonly used in food and beverages. Pharmacokinetics There is high absorption and excretion of cranberry anthocyanins in human urine, as shown by a study where11 healthy subjects drank 200 mL of cranberry juicecontaining 651 micrograms of total anthocyanins. The urin- ary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 hours, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in theurine over 24 hours was estimated to be 5% of the amount consumed. 2 Some in vitro and animal studies have suggested that cranberry may affect the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9 (see flurbiprofen, page 153,) and CYP3A4 (see nifedipine, page 153). However, clinical studies with tizanidine, page 154 (a substrate of CYP1A2), flurbiprofen,page 153 (a substrate of CYP2C9), and midazolam,page 153 (a substrate of CYP3A4) have found no evidence of a significant interaction in humans. Interactions overview Clinical studies suggest that cranberry juice and/or extracts do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin, flurbipro-fen, midazolam, tizanidine and warfarin. Despite this, there have been some case reports of raised INRs and significant bleeding with cranberry and warfarin. Cranberry juice isunlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine to a clinically relevant extent. 1. Duthie GG, Kyle JA, Jenkinson AM. Increased salicylate concentrations in urine of human volunteers after consumption of cranberry juice. J Agric Food Chem (2005) 53, 2897 -2900. 2. Ohnishi R, Ito H, Kasajima + Ciclosporin Occasional consumption of cranberry juice does not appear to affect the bioavailibility of ciclosporin. Regular daily consump-tion has not been studied. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a well-controlled, single-dose study, 12 healthy fasted subjects were given a 200-mg dose of oral ciclosporin simultaneously with240 mL of cranberry juice or water. Cranberry juice was found to have no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin. 1In this study, the cranberry juice used was reconstituted from frozen concentrate ( Ocean Spray ). This study suggests that cranberry juice does not affect the absorption of ciclosporin, and that drinking the occasional glass ofcranberry juice with ciclosporin should not affect ciclosporin levels.However, note that a study of regular daily cranberry juice consumption is required to also rule out an interaction affecting ciclosporin elimination, which may have a bearing on the safety ofregular (e.g. daily) intake of cranberry juice with ciclosporin. 1. Grenier J, Fradette C, Morelli G, Merritt GJ, Vranderick M, Ducharme MP. Pomelo juice, but not cranberry juice, affects the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine in humans. Clin Pharmacol Ther (2006) 79, 255 -62. Cranberry + Flurbiprofen Limited evidence suggests that cranberry juice does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen. Clinical evidence In a study in 14 healthy subjects, 230 mL of cranberry juice taken the night before, and 30 minutes before a single 100-mg dose offlurbiprofen, had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen. Fluconazole, used as a positive control, increased the flurbiprofen AUC by about 80%. 1In this study, the cranberry juice used was Ocean Spray cranberry juice cocktail from concentrate containing 27% cranberry juice. Experimental evidence In an in vitro study, cranberry juice inhibited flurbiprofen hydroxylation by about 44%, which was less than that of the positive control sulfaphenazole (79%).1 Mechanism Flurbiprofen is metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, and the clinical study appears to suggest that cranberry hasno clinically relevant effect on this particular isoenzyme, despite thefact that it had some weak inhibitory effects in vitro. 1 Importance and management Both the study in humans and the supporting experimental metabolic data suggest that no pharmacokinetic interaction occurs betweenflurbiprofen and cranberry juice. Therefore no dosage adjustmentappears to be necessary if patients taking flurbiprofen wish to drinkcranberry juice. Flurbiprofen is used as a probe drug for CYP2C9 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action as a result of this mechanism between cranberry juice andother CYP2C9 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Clin Pharmacol Ther (2006) 79, 125 -33.Cranberry + Food No interactions found. Note that cranberry juice is widely used in food and beverages. Cranberry + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Cranberry + Midazolam Limited evidence suggests that cranberry juice does not appearto affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study in 10 healthy subjects, 200 mL of cranberry juice three times daily for 10 days had no significant effecton the pharmacokinetics of a single 500-microgram oral dose ofmidazolam taken on day 5. In this study, the cranberry juice usedwas a concentrate ( Kontiomehu sokeroitu karpalomehu ) diluted 1 to 4 with tap water before use. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism This study suggests that cranberry juice has no clinically relevant effect on CYP3A4 activity. Importance and management Although the evidence is limited to this particular study, there appears to be no need for special precautions when taking cranberryjuice with midazolam. Midazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between cranberry juice and other 1. Lilja JJ, Backman JT, Neuvonen PJ. Effects of daily ingestion of cranberry on the pharmacokinetics of interaction between cranberry juice and nifedipine is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in human liver microsomes and ratintestinal microsomes, cranberry juice intraduodenal administration of cranberry juice toratsappeared to reduce the apparent clearance and increase the AUC of nifedipine 30 mg/kg by 44% and 60%, respectively, whencompared with a control group. However, other pharmacokinetic parameters such as the mean residence time, volume of distribution, and elimination rate constant were not significantly affected. 1Cranberry 153 CMechanism The experimental evidence suggests that cranberry juice may slightly inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 in vitro and in rats.1However, note that in a clinical study, cranberry had no effect on a single dose of midazolam, page 153, a well-established probe CYP3A4 substrate. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to two experimental studies. Taken on its own, this evidence suggests the possibility of a modestinteraction, and therefore some caution might be warranted inpatients taking nifedipine who drink cranberry juice. However, a clinical study with midazolam, page 153, a sensitive, specific substrate for CYP3A4, found no evidence of an interaction, and thissuggests that cranberry juice would be unlikely to affect thepharmacokinetics of nifedipine to a clinically relevant extent. 1. Uesawa Y, Mohri K. Effects of cranberry juice on nifedipine pharmacokinetics in rats. J Pharm Pharmacol (2006) 58, 1067 -72. Cranberry + Tizanidine Limited evidence suggests that cranberry juice does not appearto affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study in 10 healthy subjects 200 mL of cranberry juice three times daily for 10 days had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 1-mg oral dose of tizanidine taken on day 5. In this study, the cranberry juice used was aconcentrate ( Kontiomehu sokeroitu karpalomehu ) diluted 1 to 4 with tap water before use. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism This study suggests that cranberry juice has no clinically relevant effect on CYP1A2 activity. Importance and management Although the evidence is limited to this particular study, there appears to be no need for any special precautions when takingcranberry juice with tizanidine. Tizanidine is used as a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between cranberry juice JJ, JT, Neuvonen PJ. of daily ingestion of cranberry on the pharmacokinetics of and related drugs A number of case reports suggest that cranberry juice canincrease the INR of patients taking warfarin, and one patient hasdied as a result of this interaction. Other patients have developedunstable INRs or, in one isolated case, a reduced INR. However, in four controlled studies, cranberry juice did not alter theanticoagulant effect of warfarin, or had only very minor effects on the INR. Neither cranberry juice nor the extract altered warfarin pharmacokinetics.Clinical evidence (a) Case reports In September 2003, the MHRA/CSM in the UK noted that they had received 5 reports suggesting an interaction between warfarin andcranberry juice since 1999 (3 cases of INR increases, one case ofunstable INR and one case of a decrease in INR). 1By October 2004, the MHRA/CSM reported that they had now received 12 reports of asuspected interaction, including 5 additional cases of bleedingepisodes and two additional cases of unstable INRs in patientsdrinking cranberry juice while taking warfarin. 2The most serious case involved a man taking warfarin whose INR markedly increased (INR greater than 50) 6 weeks after starting to drink cranberry juice.He died from gastrointestinal and pericardial haemorrhages. 1,3 Further details of this case included that he had recently beentreated with cefalexin (not known to interact) for a chest infection,and had been eating virtually nothing for at least 2 weeks, 3a fact that would have contributed to the increase in anticoagulation. In a further published case report, a patient stabilised on warfarin was found to have INRs of 10 to 12 in the surgical procedure,although he had no previous record of an INR greater than 4.Vitamin K was given, and heparin was substituted for warfarin.When warfarin was restarted postoperatively, the INR quickly roseto 8 and then to 11 with haematuria, and postoperative bleeding. Thepatient was drinking almost 2 litres of cranberry juice daily, becauseof recurrent urinary tract infections, and was advised to stop drinking this. Three days later the INR had stabilised at 3 with no further intervention. 4Another case of fluctuating INR (between 1 and 10) in a patient taking warfarin has been attributed to cranberry juice.5 In the US, a case of major bleeding and a high INR has been reported in a man taking warfarin, which occurred shortly aftercranberry juice 710 mL daily was started. 6Another case describes an increase in the INR of a patient receiving warfarin, from below 3 to6.45, without bleeding, after the patient drank about 2 litres of cranberry/apple juice over the last week. Of note, the patient was subsequently re-stabilised on a lower dose of warfarin and may havetaken an extra dose of warfarin in the week before the raised INRwas measured. 7 (b) Controlled studies In one controlled crossover study, 7 male patients with atrial fibrillation who were taking stable doses of warfarin drank 250 mL of cranberry juice or placebo [daily] for a week without anysignificant change in their INR from baseline values. 8The same finding was reported in another very similar study in patients taking warfarin .9However, note that the daily volume of cranberry juice in these studies was lower than the daily volume in the couple of casereports where cranberry juice intake is known. Nevertheless, inanother controlled study in 10 healthy subjects, a higher volume ofcranberry juice (200 mL three times daily) for 10 days did not alterthe effect of a single 10-mg dose of warfarin (given on day 5) on the maximum thromboplastin time or AUC of the thromboplastin time.10 In addition, cranberry juice had no effect on warfarin pharmaco-kinetics, except that there was a slight non-significant 7% decrease in the AUC of S-warfarin. In yet another study in 12 healthy subjects, cranberry juice concentrate 2 capsules three times daily for 21 days (equivalent to57 g of fruit daily) had no effect on the maximum INR after a single25-mg dose of warfarin given on day 15 (2.8 versus 2.6). However, the AUC of the INR was slightly increased by 28%, which wasstatistically significant, but the clinical relevance of this measure is uncertain. The cranberry concentrate had no effect on platelet aggregation, and had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of eitherR-orS-warfarin. 11 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Not known. It was originally suggested that one or more of the constituents of cranberry juice might inhibit the metabolism of154 Cranberry Cwarfarin by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, thereby reducing its clearance from the body and increasing its effects.1 However, four studies have shown that cranberry juice or cranberry extracts do not alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, and cranberry juice had no effect on flurbiprofen pharmacokinetics, a drug used asa surrogate index of CYP2C9 activity. 12See also flurbiprofen, page 153. An interaction might therefore be via a pharmacodynamicmechanism. For example, the salicylate constituent of commercialcranberry juice might cause hypoprothrombinaemia. 13 Importance and management An interaction is not established. Controlled studies have not found a pharmacokinetic interaction, and only one of four studies foundany evidence for an increase in warfarin effect. Moreover, theclinical relevance of the finding of this study of a 0.2 increase inINR and 28% increase in AUC of the INR is likely to be slight atmost, and does not fit with the sometimes marked increase in INRseen in some case reports. This might be explained if the interaction is dose dependent (in one of the cases where cranberry intake was mentioned a quantity of 2 litres daily was beingconsumed), or if it is product dependent (i.e. due to a constituentpresent in the cranberry juice that is not standardised for and varieswidely). However, it could also be that there is no specificinteraction, and that the case reports just represent idiosyncraticreactions in which other unknown factors (e.g. altered diet) weremore important. In 2004, on the basis of the then available case reports and lack of controlled studies, the CSM/MHRA in the UK advised that patientstaking warfarin should avoid drinking cranberry juice unless thehealth benefits are considered to outweigh any risks. Theyrecommended increased INR monitoring for any patient takingwarfarin and who has a regular intake of cranberry juice. 2They also advised similar precautions with other cranberry products (such ascapsules or concentrates). 2These might still be prudent precautions, although the controlled studies now available do provide somereassurance that, in otherwise healthy individuals, moderate doses ofcranberry juice are unlikely to have an important impact onanticoagulation control. 1.

Creatine phosphate is also used. Use and indications Creatine supplements are taken most often to improve exercise performance and increase muscle mass. They are also used for the treatment of cardiac disorders and havepossible uses for motor neurone disease, muscular dystro-phies, Huntington 's disease and Parkinson 's disease. Creatine is found in foods, most abundantly in meat and fish, and is also synthesised endogenously. Excessive intake of creatine, by the use of supplements, has, very rarely, been reported to cause acute renal impairment. 1 Pharmacokinetics Creatine is distributed throughout the body, with the majority being found in skeletal muscle. Creatine is degraded tocreatinine, and both creatine and creatinine are excreted viathe kidneys. Absorption of creatine is likely to be an active process, and may follow nonlinear kinetics with theingestion of high doses because of saturation of skeletal muscle stores, although this has not been confirmed experimentally. The maximum plasma level of creatine is reached less than 2 hours after the ingestion of doses ofunder 10 g, but after more than 3 hours for doses over 10 g, and may vary with the ingestion of carbohydrate, see food, page 157. Clearance of creatine would appear to bedependent on both skeletal muscle and renal function. 2 Interactions overview There are no established interactions with creatine, but thereis some evidence that caffeine might counteract its beneficialeffects, and a high carbohydrate intake might increase itsretention. There is an isolated report of stroke in a patient taking a creatine supplement with caffeine plus ephedra, although the role of creatine in this case is uncertain.

Pharmacokinetics of Pharmacokinet (2003) 42, 557 -74.C 156Creatine + Caffeine Limited evidence suggests that the performance-enhancing effects of creatine may be reduced by caffeine. Clinical evidence Nine healthy subjects given a creatine supplement 500 mg/kg daily for 6 days, and caffeine capsules 5 mg/kg daily for 3 days beginningon the fourth day, experienced a lack of performance-enhancingeffects of creatine during knee extension exercises, when compared with creatine given alone. One subject experienced some gastro- intestinal discomfort during concurrent use. 1 These findings were replicated in a later study in 9 healthy subjects. Caffeine 5 mg/kg reduced phosphocreatine resynthesisduring rest from a period of exercise when given with creatine 25 gdaily for 2 or 5 days. 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Caffeine appears to inhibit the resynthesis of endogenous phospho- creatine during recovery from a period of strenuous exercise, which,in turn, delays the formation of the energy source, ATP. Importance and management These studies are preliminary and there seem to be no further reports of an interaction. However, those taking creatine supplements toenhance exercise performance should perhaps reduce caffeine intakefrom beverages and other sources. Note that caffeine is also presentin a number of herbal medicines, consider also caffeine-containingherbs, page 97. 1. Vandenberghe K, Gillis N, van Leemputte M, van Hecke P, Vanstapel F, Hespel P.

Clinical evidence In a study, 22 healthy male subjects were given 5 g creatine alone, or with 500 mL Lucozade (which provided a source of glucose and simple sugars) every 4 to 5 hours, giving a total dose of creatine of20 g daily for 2 days. Subjects who received creatine alone continuedtheir normal diet, whereas those receiving creatine with Lucozade received a high-carbohydrate diet. The peak plasma concentrationand AUC of creatine was higher in those who had not received the glucose load (as Lucozade ), but this group also demonstrated the highest urinary creatine excretion. 1In a similar study, the effect of about 50 g of protein plus 50 g of carbohydrate on the retention of creatine from supplements was similar to that of high carbohydrate(100 g carbohydrate). 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The authors suggested that their findings indicate that the ingestion of carbohydrate with creatine led to an increase in insulin secretion,resulting in an increased uptake of creatine by skeletal muscle,1and that protein/carbohydrate might have a similar effect.2 Importance and management These studies suggest that patients who are taking creatine to improve their muscle creatine stores might experience better resultsif the creatine is taken at the same time as high amounts ofcarbohydrates or protein/carbohydrates. However, this requiresfurther study. 1. Green AL, Simpson EJ, Littlewood JJ, Macdonald IA, Greenhaff PL. Carbohydrate ingestion augments retention during creatine feeding in humans.

Creatine + Herbal medicines; Ephedra with Caffeine There is an isolated report of stroke in a patient taking a creatine supplement with ephedra plus caffeine, although the role ofcreatine in this case is uncertain. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A 33-year-old fit man with no vascular risk factors had a stroke 6 weeks after starting to take two supplements to aid body building.The first contained ephedra alkaloids (from ma huang), caffeine,levocarnitine and chromium, and the second contained creatine,taurine, inosine and coenzyme Q 10. His daily consumption was estimated to be 40 to 60 mg of ephedra alkaloids, 400 to 600 mg ofcaffeine and 6 g of creatine. 1Note that serious adverse events such as stroke have been reported with caffeine and dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, and ephedra is banned in some countries. See Ephedra + Caffeine, page 176. Therefore, this casecould be attributed to this supplement alone, and the role of creatineis unclear. Note that caffeine might counteract some beneficial effects of creatine. Consider caffeine, above. 1. Vahedi K, Domigo V P, consumed MaHuang and creatine monohydrate for body building. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry (2000) 68, 112 -13. Creatine + Laboratory tests There is a possibility that creatine supplements might complicatethe interpretation of serum creatinine measurement. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Creatinine is produced in muscles from the breakdown of creatine, and is excreted by the kidneys. Blood levels of creatinine aretherefore used as one measure to estimate renal function. It is possible that dietary supplementation with creatine could lead to increased serum levels of creatinine, and this might be particularlyso in patients with impaired renal function and with long-term use. 1 Note that, it has been suggested that the long-term, high-dose use of creatine supplements might actually contribute to worsening renal function,1although further study is needed to establish this. It would be sensible for individuals taking creatine supplements to tell their health provider this fact, if they need to have renal functiontests. 1. Yoshizumi WM, Tsourounis C.

Constituents The root and leaf of dandelion vitamin A are also found. Use and indications Dandelion has been widely used as a diuretic, and also for itspurported laxative, anti-inflammatory, choleretic (to increase bile secretion) and blood-glucose-lowering activity. Some of these activities have been demonstrated in some, but not all,animal studies, and no human studies appear to have been published. 1Dandelion has been used as a foodstuff (the leaf in salads, and the ground root as a coffee substitute). Aprebiotic effect has been suggested for the root.Pharmacokinetics In a study in ratspre-treated for 4 weeks with a dandelion tea solution 2%, the solution inhibited the cytochrome P450isoenzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2E by 85% and 52%,respectively, when compared with a control group, but did not change CYP2D and CYP3A activity. An increase in UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity of 244% was alsoreported in the rats given dandelion tea. 2The findings of animal studies cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, but positive findings such as these suggest that clinicalstudies are required. For information on the pharmaco-kinetics of individual flavonoids present in dandelion, seeunder flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview No interactions specific to dandelion, although there is limited evidence from animals thatTaraxacum mongolicum (the species used in Chinese medicine) might alter the absorption of ciprofloxacin.

Effect of herbal teas on hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes in rats. J Pharm Pharmacol (2001) Taraxacum mongolicum and ciproflox- acin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats, an aqueous extract of Taraxacum mongolicum (2 g crude drug/kg) significantly reduced the maximum concentration of a single 20-mg/kg oral dose of ciprofloxacin by 73% whencompared with administration of oral ciprofloxacin alone. Theoverall tissue distribution and half-life were also increased, althoughthe AUC was not different. The Taraxacum mongolicum extract used was analysed and found to have a high concentration of magnesium,calcium and iron. 1 Mechanism Cations such as magnesium, calcium and iron are known to chelate with ciprofloxacin and modestly reduce its overall absorption.However, in this study, the overall absorption of ciprofloxacin wasunchanged. The reason for the reduced maximum level andprolonged elimination half-life is uncertain.Importance and management The general significance of this animal study is unclear, especially as the overall absorption of ciprofloxacin did not appear to be affected. Further study is required to discover if, and under what circum-stances, dandelion might interact with ciprofloxacin in clinical use. Also, study is needed to see whether the effects of the dandelion species used in this study ( Taraxacum mongolicum ) to Li RC.

Constituents Danshen products (3,4-dihydroxy-phenyllactic acid). Other constituents include fatty-acid (oleoyl) derivatives, lithospermic acid B, and salvinal (a benzofuran) and nitrogen-containing compounds such assalvianen. Use and indications The dried root of danshen is traditionally used in Chinesemedicine for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, specifically angina pectoris, hyperlipidaemia and acute ischaemic stroke, but also palpitations, hypertension, throm-bosis and menstrual problems. It is also used as ananti-inflammatory and for the treatment of cancer and liver disease. Pharmacokinetics Limited in vitro andanimal studies suggest that danshen extracts affect the activities of various cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. However, these effects do not appear to beclinically relevant. In a study in mice, a commercial pharmaceutical extract of danshen induced the activity ofthe aqueous extract had no effect, whereas an ethyl acetate extract, which is not used in pharmaceutical preparations,had a very marked four- to eightfold increase in CYP1A2activity. A purified extract of tanshinone IIA had a similareffect in this study, 1and in one of two mice models in another study.2Conversely, in another study using mice and human liver microsomes, tanshinone IIA (extracted in ethylacetate ) inhibited CYP1A2.3Any potent effects of danshen extracts on CYP1A2 therefore appear to be limited to ethyl extracts of danshen, which are not used clinically. The more modest effects found with the commercial pharmaceuticalextract may not be clinically relevant, as clinical studies with theophylline, page 163, a substrate of CYP1A2 did not find a clinically relevant interaction. The extracts of danshen that are used pharmaceutically do not appear to have clinically relevant effects on CYP2C9 (see tolbutamide, page 163) or CYP3A4 (see calcium- channel blockers, page 162). Some extracts of danshen may inhibit P-glycoprotein, see under digoxin, page 162. Interactions overview Some case reports and animal data indicate that danshen can, rarely, increase the effects of warfarin, resulting in bleeding.The antiplatelet activity of danshen may be partly respon-sible, and therefore additive antiplatelet effects might occur if danshen is taken with conventional antiplatelet drugs, which may also increase the risk of bleeding. Danshen canfalsify the results of serum immunoassay methods fordigoxin, and experimental evidence suggests that danshen could raise digoxin levels. Additive blood-pressure-lowering effects could, in theory, occur if danshen is taken withnifedipine, but no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic inter-action appears to occur. Clinical evidence suggests that danshen does not affect the pharmacokinetics of theo- phylline, and experimental evidence suggests that danshendoes not affect the pharmacokinetics of alcohol, or tolbutamide. 1. a herb Salvia miltiorrhiza in C57BL/6J but not in DBA/2J mice.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence An oral danshen extract 200 mg/kg inhibited the oral absorption of alcohol in rats. Blood-alcohol levels were reduced by up to 60% in comparison to control rats. Danshen had no effect on blood-alcohol levels when ethanol was injected intraperitoneally. The danshen used in this study was standardised to contain 13% tanshinone IIA.1 Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between alcohol and danshen appears to be limited to one study in rats. Even if these results are replicated in humans, any effect is probably not clinically relevant, and danshen iscertainly not proven for use as an aid to reducing alcohol absorptionor lowering blood-alcohol levels. 1. Colombo G, Agabio GL. Salvia miltiorrhiza extract inhibits alcohol absorption, preference, and discrimination in sP rats. Alcohol (1999) 18, 65 -70. Danshen + Calcium-channel blockers The interaction between danshen and calcium-channel blockersis based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in mice, a commercial pharmaceutical extract and an aqueous extract of danshen had no effect on nifedipine oxidation. In contrast an ethyl acetate extract of danshen (which is not used as a pharmaceutical preparation) caused a threefold increase in nifedipine oxidation. 1Another study found that purified tanshinone IIA, present in ethyl acetate extracts, caused a decrease in nifedipine oxidation in mice,2whereas a third study reported no change in nifedipine oxidation by tanshinone IIA in human liver microsomes.3 Studies in the ratfemoral artery have shown that danshen extracts cause vasorelaxant effects.4 Mechanism Contradictory findings have been reported on the effect of ethyl acetate danshen extracts on isoenzyme CYP3A4. This could beincreased, decreased or unchanged. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between nifedipine and danshen appears to be limited to experimental studies, which suggest that the type of danshen extract used is important in determining whether or not aninteraction may occur. In general an interaction with pharmaceuticalextracts seems unlikely. Ethyl acetate extracts may decreasenifedipine metabolism, but as these are not used pharmaceutically,this is of little clinical relevance. A pharmacodynamic interactionmay occur, because both nifedipine and danshen have calcium- channel-blocking effects. Until more is known, some caution might be warranted if patients take nifedipine (and possibly any calcium-channel blocker) with danshen, as additive blood pressure-loweringeffects could, in theory, occur. 1. a herb Salvia miltiorrhiza in C57BL/6J but not in DBA/2J mice.

Danshen + Digoxin The interaction between danshen and digoxin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Two in vitro studies1,2have assessed the effects of tanshinone IIA and tanshinone IIB (major constituents of danshen) on the uptake of digoxin by P-glycoprotein. Both extracts exhibited concentration- dependent inhibitor effects on P-glycoprotein. Tanshinone IIA had the greatest effects of the two extracts, inhibiting the P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of digoxin in a similar manner to verapamil, aknown clinically relevant P-glycoprotein inhibitor. The effects oftanshinone IIB were modest in comparison. Mechanism Tanshinone IIA appears to be a clinically relevant inhibitor of P- glycoprotein, of which digoxin is a substrate. Importance and management The available data appear to be from experimental studies in which specific constituents of danshen were used. This makes it difficult toextrapolate the data to the use of the herb in a clinical setting. Whatis known suggests that danshen may inhibit the transport of digoxinby P-glycoprotein, which could lead to raised digoxin levels. Therefore if danshen is taken by a patient receiving digoxin it may be prudent to be alert for symptoms of raised digoxin levels, such asbradycardia, and consider monitoring levels, should this occur.However, note that danshen may interfere with some of the testsused to assess digoxin levels, see also laboratory tests, page 163. 1.

Danshen + Herbal medicines No interactions found.162 Danshen DDanshen + Laboratory tests Danshen can falsify the results of serum immunoassay methods for digoxin. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Danshen can falsify some laboratory measurements of digoxin because it contains digoxin-like immunoreactive components. Astudy fluorescent polarisation immunoassay method(Abbott Laboratories) for digoxin gave falsely high readings in the presence of danshen, whereas a microparticle enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories) gave falsely low readings. These, or similarfindings, have been reported elsewhere. 1These false readings could be eliminated by monitoring the free (i.e. unbound) digoxinconcentrations 2or by choosing assay systems that are unaffected by the presence of danshen (said to be the Roche and Beckmansystems serum from patients taking digoxin, to which a variety of danshenextracts were added, the use of a fluorescent polarisationimmunoassay gave variable results, whereas the results were moreconsistent with a chemiluminescent assay, Randox digoxin assay. 5It would therefore seem prudent, wherever possible, to use a chemiluminescent assay fordigoxin in patients also taking danshen. 1.

Experimental evidence (a) Protein binding In vitro experiments show that danshen can increase free salicylate concentration by displacing salicylate from binding to albumin proteins. In contrast, unexpectedly, salicylate significantly decreasedfree danshen concentrations at full anti-inflammatory concentrationsof salicylate (150 micrograms/mL and above). However, no signifi-cant change in free danshen concentrations was observed whensalicylate concentrations were less than this (up to 100 micrograms/ mL). 1 (b) Pharmacodynamic An active component of danshen (765-3) has been shown to inhibit human platelet aggregation via its effects on platelet calcium.2 Mechanism In vitro many conventional drugs are capable of being displaced by others, but in the body the effects seem almost always to be bufferedso effectively that the outcome is not normally clinically important. It would therefore seem that the importance of this interactionmechanism has been grossly over-emphasised. It is difficult to find an example of a clinically important interaction (with conventional drugs) due to this mechanism alone. Additive antiplatelet effects might occur, which might increase the risk of bleeding. Importance and management In vitro evidence suggests that danshen displaces salicylate from protein-binding sites at high doses, but the clinical relevance of this seems minimal. There may be a more clinically significant interaction with low-dose aspirin, as both it and danshen haveantiplatelet activity. Concurrent use may therefore result in additiveantiplatelet effects. Bear this possibility in mind if unexpected signsof bleeding, such as bruising, occur. 1. Gupta D, Jalali M, Wells A, Dasgupta A.

Danshen + Theophylline Danshen does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics oftheophylline. Clinical evidence In a crossover study, 12 healthy subjects were given a single 100-mg dose of theophylline alone and, after taking four tablets, eachcontaining an extract of danshen 1 g, three times daily, for 14 days.Danshen slightly decreased the time to maximum theophyllinelevels, but this was not expected to be clinically relevant, and noother pharmacokinetic parameters were altered. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Alcoholic extracts of danshen may have effects on cytochrome P450 CYP1A2, the isoenzyme by which theophylline is metabolised. SeePharmacokinetics, page 161. Importance and management The available evidence is limited, but seems to suggest that the dose of theophylline will not need to be altered in patients also takingdanshen extract tablets. 1.

Danshen + Tolbutamide The information regarding the use of danshen with tolbutamideis based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in mice, a commercial pharmaceutical extract of danshen had no effect on tolbutamide hydroxylation. Similarly, an aqueous extract had no effect, whereas the ethyl acetate extract (which is notused as a pharmaceutical preparation, and contained the greatest amount of tanshinone IIA) caused a twofold increase in DHowever, in vitro not affect the oxidation of tolbutamide in mouse or human liver microsomes.2 Mechanism Tolbutamide is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, and is also used as a probe substrate to assess the effects ofother substances on this isoenzyme. The evidence suggests that theusual extracts of danshen do not affect tolbutamide metabolism, andtherefore would not be expected to have clinically relevant effects onother substrates of CYP2C9. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to two experimental studies. However, they provide reasonably strong evidence to suggest thatdanshen will not affect the metabolism of tolbutamide. Therefore nodosage adjustments are expected to be needed if danshen is given topatients also taking tolbutamide. This study also suggests thatdanshen is unlikely to affect the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of this isoenzyme. 1. Kuo (2003) 33, 603 -13. Danshen + Warfarin and related drugs Three case reports and some animal data indicate that danshen can increase the effects of warfarin, resulting in bleeding. Clinical evidence A woman taking warfarin, furosemide and digoxin, who began to take danshen on alternate days, was hospitalised a month later withanaemia and bleeding (prothrombin time greater than 60 seconds,INR greater than 5.62). The anaemia was attributed to occultgastrointestinal bleeding and the over-anticoagulation to an inter-action with the danshen. She was later restabilised on warfarin in the absence of the danshen with an INR of 2.5, and within 4 months her haemoglobin levels were normal. 1 A man taking warfarin, digoxin, captopril and furosemide, with an INR of about 3, developed chest pain and breathlessness about2 weeks after starting to take danshen. He was found to have amassive pleural effusion, and an INR of more than 8.4. He was laterdischarged on his usual dose of warfarin with an INR stable at 3, in the absence of the danshen. 2 Over-anticoagulation was investigated in Chinese patients admit- ted to a medical unit during a 9-month period in 1994/1995. An interaction with warfarin was reported in a patient using a medicatedoil product that contained methyl salicylate 15%, and an 'analgesic balm 'that contained danshen, methyl salicylate 50% and diclofe- nac. 3 Experimental evidence In a study in rats, danshen aqueous extract 5 g/kg twice daily givenintraperitoneally for 3 days prolonged the prothrombin time and increased the steady-state levels of both isomers of warfarin.4Similar findings were reported in another earlier study by the same group.5 In contrast, in a study in mice, a commercial pharmaceutical extract of danshen had no effect on warfarin isoenzyme had no effect, but an ethyl acetate extract (which is not usedas a pharmaceutical preparation, and contained the greatest amountof tanshinone IIA) increased warfarin 7-hydroxylation threefold, which would be expected to lead to a decrease in its anticoagulanteffects. 6 A study in animals found that high doses of Kangen-Karyu (a g/kg twicedaily inhibited the metabolism and elimination of single doses ofwarfarin, and prolonged bleeding time. There was no interaction at alower dose of 500 mg/kg, which suggests that a clinical interaction isunlikely at the recommended dose of 90 mg/kg of Kangen-Karyu daily. 7 Mechanism Danshen has antiplatelet actions, which may be additive to the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. The mechanism for the increase in warfarin levels is unknown, because the studies suggest that theusual extracts of danshen do not inhibit the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2C9, the main route of warfarin metabolism.Consider also tolbutamide, page 163, and for more information onthe antiplatelet effects of danshen, see salicylates, page 163. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to three case studies, which alone would be insufficient to establish an interaction. The pharmaco-kinetic effects of the usual extracts of danshen seem to suggest thatan interaction resulting in raised warfarin levels is unlikely in most patients. However, because danshen may have antiplatelet effects, an interaction between warfarin and danshen, resulting in increasedbleeding, is possible. Clinically the use of an antiplatelet drug withan anticoagulant should generally be avoided in the absence of aspecific indication. It may therefore be prudent to advise againstconcurrent use. However, if concurrent use is felt desirable it wouldseem sensible to warn patients to be alert for any signs of bruising or bleeding, and report these immediately, should they occur. 1.

Constituents Devil 's claw is usually standardised to the content of the iridoid iridoid and indications The dried secondary root tuber is used as a stomachic and bitter tonic, and for inflammatory disorders including arthritis, gout, myalgia, fibrositis, lumbago and rheumaticdisease.Pharmacokinetics In vitro, a Devil 's claw extract moderately inhibited the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C8,CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. 1Devil 's claw had the greatest effect on CYP2C9, but this was still, at best, a modest effect. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in Devil 's claw, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Limited evidence is available. Devil 's claw does not appear to affect blood pressure, and its theoretical interaction withdrugs with antiplatelet effects seems unlikely to be of practical relevance; however, it may increase the antic- oagulant effects of drugs such as warfarin.

Clinical evidence In a randomised, placebo-controlled, 4-week study, 1a Devil 's claw extract was studied for the possible treatment of low back pain in 109 patients. One patient had an episode of tachycardia while on holiday, and stopped taking the herbal medicine. When he returnedfrom holiday, Devil 's claw was restarted and was well tolerated. It was suggested that this adverse event was due to the change inclimate rather than the medication. Furthermore, in the study, therewas no significant change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure orheart rate between the beginning and the end of the study, and between Devil 's claw and placebo recipients. The Devil 's claw extract used in this study was given at a dose of 800 mg three times daily, equivalent to a daily dose of 50 mg of harpagoside. 1 Experimental evidence Crude methanolic extracts of Devil 's claw, and isolated harpagoside, showed a significant and dose-dependent, protective action towards ventricular arrhythmias in rathearts.2,3In other animal studies, high doses of Devil 's claw have caused a reduction in blood pressure.3,4 Mechanism No mechanism established. Importance and management Clinical evidence is limited to one study that was not specifically designed to assess interactions. However, the available data suggest that Devil 's claw, used in standard doses, is unlikely to affect treatment with conventional antihypertensives, although this ideally needs confirmation in hypertensive patients. The reduction in bloodpressure found in animal studies seems unlikely to be clinically relevant, due to the high doses used. Too little is known to be able tomake any clinical recommendations regarding the potential anti-arrhythmic effect of Devil 's claw. 1. Chrubasik S, Zimpfer CH, Sch\u00fctt U, Ziegler R.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management One licensed preparation for Devil 's claw suggests that there is a theoretical increased risk of bleeding if Devil 's claw is given with drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation, such as antiplatelet drugs and NSAIDs.1The exact basis for this recommendation is unclear and another subsequently licensed preparation does not carry thiswarning. 2A case report suggests that Devil 's claw may interact with warfarin, see below, but this seems most likely to be due to ametabolic effect rather than intrinsic antiplatelet properties. Devil 'sclaw appears to be contraindicated in peptic ulceration, and thiscould be taken to suggest that any antiplatelet effects that it mayhave could increase the risks of bleeding from an ulcer. However, some sources suggest that this contraindication is because of the bitter properties of Devil 's claw (implying that it may stimulate gastric secretions), and there are no documented cases of bleeding orulceration with the use of Devil 's claw. This warning with antiplatelet drugs and NSAIDs therefore appears to representtremendous caution and it seems unlikely that the theoreticalprediction will be of clinical importance. 1.

Devil's claw + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Devil's claw + Warfarin and related drugs Devil 's claw may increase the effects of warfarin, and possibly other coumarins. Clinical evidence A case report from a 5-year toxicological study1describes the development of purpura in a patient following the concurrent use of Devil 's claw and warfarin. Experimental evidence In an in vitro study, a Devil 's claw extract modestly inhibited the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9.2 MechanismLimited in vitro evidence suggests that claw may inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9. 2Although the metabolism of warfarin is complex, CYP2C9 plays a significant role. Therefore it is possible that Devil 's claw could inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, raising its levels and increasing its effect. Importance and management Evidence is limited to a case study, which reports minor adverse effects, and experimental data. An interaction seems possible, but ithas not been conclusively demonstrated. Although only warfarin hasbeen studied, all coumarins are metabolised by CYP2C9 to someextent, and therefore they also have the potential to be affected. Theevidence is too sparse to make any firm recommendations, but itmay be prudent to consider a possible interaction if a patient taking acoumarin develops otherwise unexplained bruising. 1.

Simultaneous determination of the inhibitory potency of herbal extracts on the activity of six major cytochrome P450 enzymes using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and automated online Rapid Commun Other BP Parts ( USP 32 ); Herb (BP 2009 ); Powder and Powdered extract ( USP 32 ); Root (BP 2009 ,USP 32 ). Constituents The constituents of the various species are slightly differentand this leads to confusion as to the potential for druginteractions. (a) Echinacea angustifolia The the saturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids, tussilagine and isotussilagine, are also present (these the unsaturated hepatotoxic type). (b) Echinacea polyacetylenes, including a range of ketoalkenes and ketopolyacetylenes, have been reported and polysaccharides and glycoproteins are also present. (c) alkaloids tussilagine and isotussilagine are present. The herb contains similar alkamides, and cichoric acid is the major caffeic acid derivative Polysaccharides (a methylglucuronoarabinoxylan), PS2 (an acidicrhamnoarabinogalactan), a xyloglucan and glycoproteinshave been reported. The pressed juice (from the aerial parts) contains hetero- geneous polysaccharides, inulin-type compounds, arabino-galactan polysaccharides and glycoproteins. Echinacea is mainly used for its immunostimulant (immu-nomodulatory) effects, particularly in the treatment andprevention of the common cold, influenza and other upperrespiratory tract infections. It has a long history of medicinal use for infections, both bacterial and viral, especially in skin conditions such as acne and boils, and also in mildsepticaemia. Pharmacokinetics Most work has been carried out using Echinacea purpurea , although other Echinacea species have been studied on selected isoenzymes. In vitro studies using non-drug probe substrates1,2suggest that Echinacea purpurea extracts (Echinacare andEchinagard) do not on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6: afinding supported by in vitro and clinical studies using drugs as probe substrates, see dextromethorphan, page 169. Simi-larly, in Echinagard andEchinaforce or only weakly inhibit, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. These in vitro findings for CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 would be expected to be replicated in most patients, as suggested by clinical studies with the probe substrates tolbutamide, page 170, and caffeine, page 169, respectively. The effects of echinacea on CYP3A4 are less clear. Some one study2the inhibitory properties varied greatly (150-fold). This seemedto be related to the alkamide content of the extract, althoughEchinacea pallida contains only low concentrations of alkamides, so other constituents may also have a role in CYP3A4 inhibition. Indeed, one study found that the caffeic acid derivatives echinacoside and cichoric acid causedmoderate and very weak CYP3A4 inhibition, respectively. 4 The findings of a clinical study using midazolam (a probesubstrate for CYP3A4) were also somewhat complex (seemidazolam, page 170), but appears to suggest only aclinically modest effect of echinacea on CYP3A4.E 167Interactions overview Theoretically, echinacea may antagonise the effects of immunosuppressants. The use of echinacea has been studiedwith a number of drugs that are used as probe substrates forcytochrome P450 activity or P-glycoprotein. With the possible exceptions of midazolam and caffeine, no clinically relevant interactions have been identified. Echinacea seemsto present a low risk for interactions occurring as a result ofthese mechanisms.1. Yale SH, Glurich I. Analysis 2C9. 433 -9. 2. Modarai M, Gertsch J, Suter A, A.

In most patients, echinacea is unlikely toraise caffeine levels. Clinical evidence In a pharmacokinetic study, 12 healthy subjects were given an 8-day course of Echinacea purpurea root 400 mg four times daily, with a single 200-mg oral dose of caffeine on day 6. The maximum serum concentration and AUC of caffeine were increased by about 30%. There was a large variation between subjects, with some having a50% increase in caffeine clearance, and some a 90% decrease . However, the paraxanthine-to-caffeine ratio (a measure of CYP1A2activity) was reduced by just 10%. 1In another study in 12 healthy subjects given Echinacea purpurea 800 mg twice daily for 28 days, the paraxanthine-to-caffeine ratio was not significantly affected when a single 100-mg dose of caffeine was given at the end of the treatment with Echinacea purpurea .2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Echinacea is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, which is involved in caffeine metabolism. Echinacea was therefore expected to raise caffeine levels. Although the studiesfound that caffeine levels were modestly raised by caffeine this didnot appear to be due to an effect of echinacea on CYP1A2 (effectsfound were mild). Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to the two studies cited, which suggest that in most patients echinacea is unlikely to raise caffeine levels by inhibiting CYP1A2. However, some patients did experi-ence a decrease in caffeine clearance, which suggests that, rarely,caffeine levels may be raised. Some patients may thereforeexperience some increase in the adverse effects of caffeine, suchas headache, tremor and restlessness, particularly if they have a ahigh caffeine intake. Should this occur, advise the patient to eitherstop taking echinacea and/or reduce their caffeine intake. Caffeine is used as a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between echinacea and other CYP1A2 substrates S-M, Pinto A, Hamman MA, Hilligoss JK, Zaheer NA, Desai M, Miller M, Hall SD.

Echinacea + Dextromethorphan Echinacea does not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan. Clinical evidence In a study, 12 healthy subjects were given Echinacea purpurea root 400 mg four times daily for 8 days with a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan on day 6. In the 11 subjects who were of thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 extensive metaboliserphenotype there were no changes in the pharmacokinetics ofdextromethorphan. In contrast, the one subject who was a poormetaboliser had a 42% increase in the AUC of dextromethorphan and a 31% increase in its half-life. 1In another study, in 12 healthy subjects given Echinacea purpurea 800 mg twice daily for 28 days,there was no change in the debrisoquine urinary ratio after a single 5-mg dose of debrisoquine .2 Experimental evidence In vitro studies found that an ethanol-based extract of Echinacea purpura (Echinagard ) produced a metabolism, a marker for CYP2D6 activity.3,4 Similar effects have been found with other probe substrates of CYP2D6.5 Mechanism In vitro studies suggest that echinacea has weak inhibitory effects on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6; however, the in vivo study using debrisoquine (another probe substrate of CYP2D6) suggests that this is not of clinical relevance. Importance and management The available evidence seems to reliably suggest that in most patients echinacea does not affect the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan. Those who are lacking, or are deficient, inCYP2D6 may experience a modest increase in dextromethorphanlevels. However, dextromethorphan is generally considered to have awide therapeutic range and the dose is not individually titrated.Therefore, the interaction is probably unlikely to be clinicallyrelevant. Dextromethorphan is used as a probe drug for CYP2D6 activity, and therefore these results (along with those for debrisoquine) alsosuggest that a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactionbetween echinacea and substrates S-M, Pinto A, Hamman MA, Hilligoss JK, Zaheer NA, Desai M, Miller M, Hall SD.

Echinacea + Digoxin Echinacea does not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Clinical evidence In a study, 18 healthy subjects were given an extract containing Echinacea purpurea 195 mg and Echinacea angustifolia 72 mg three times daily for 14 days with a single 250-microgram dose of digoxinbefore and after the course of echinacea. No significant effects on thepharmacokinetics of digoxin were reported for echinacea, suggestingthat echinacea does not have any significant effects onP-glycoprotein. No adverse effects were reported when digoxinwas given with echinacea. 1 Experimental evidence Anin vitro study found that Echinacea purpurea extract had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, a substrate for P-glycoprotein.2 Mechanism No mechanism expected. Importance and management The available evidence suggests that echinacea does not significantlyEchinacea 169 Eaffect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, and therefore no digoxin dosage adjustments appear necessary if echinacea is also taken. Digoxin is used as a probe substrate for P-glycoprotein, and therefore these results also suggest that a clinically relevantpharmacokinetic interaction between echinacea and other P-glycoprotein substrates is unlikely.

Echinacea + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Echinacea + Immunosuppressants The interaction between echinacea and immunosuppressants is based on a prediction only. Evidence, mechanism and importance and management Echinacea has immunostimulating effects. Theoretically therefore, echinacea may antagonise the effects of immunosuppressant drugs. The manufacturers of three echinacea products licensed by the MHRA in the UK advise against concurrent use with immunosup-pressants and specifically name ciclosporin and methotrexate .1-3 There do not appear to be any clinical reports of an interaction,but, until more is known, it may be prudent to follow this advice. 1.

Echinacea + Midazolam Echinacea does not appear to alter the AUC and clearance oforal midazolam, although the bioavailability may be increased.Clearance of intravenous midazolam may be modestly increasedin patients taking echinacea. Clinical evidence In a pharmacokinetic study, 12 healthy subjects were given Echinacea purpurea root ( Nature 's Bounty , USA) 400 mg four times daily for 28 days, with a single 50-microgram/kg intravenous dose of midazolam on day 6 and, 24 hours later, a single 5-mg oral dose of midazolam. The clearance of intravenous midazolam wasincreased by 42%, and its AUC was reduced 23%. In contrast, theclearance and AUC of oral midazolam were not significantly altered; however, the oral bioavailability of midazolam was increased by 50% but the oral bioavailability was still relatively low. In anotherstudy in 12 healthy subjects given Echinacea purpurea 800 mg twice daily for 28 days with a single 8-mg oral dose of midazolam, therewas no difference in the ratio of midazolam to its 1-hydroxymetabolite. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Midazolam is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. It was suggested opposing effects on the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP3A in the liver and the intestine, which resulted in this difference in its effects on oral and intravenous midazolam. 2 Importance and management Direct evidence about an interaction between midazolam and echinacea appears to be limited to these two clinical studies. Theirfindings suggest that echinacea is unlikely to interact with oralmidazolam, as even though the oral bioavailability was increased this did not affect the maximum levels or AUC. The interaction of echinacea with intravenous midazolam is, at best, modest. As thedose of intravenous midazolam is usually tapered to the individual 's response, the potential for a reduced effect should be accommodated.The authors of one of the studies 2suggest that the effect of echinacea on CYP3A4 substrates may depend on whether they have high oralbioavailability and the degree of hepatic extraction, and is not easilypredicted. More study is needed to establish if echinacea has any clinically relevant effects on a range of CYP3A4 substrates. See the table Drugs and herbs affecting or metabolised by the cytochromeP450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, page 8, for a list of known CYP3A4substrates. 1.

The effect of echinacea (Echinacea Echinacea + Tolbutamide Echinacea does not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide. Clinical evidence In a pharmacokinetic study, 12 healthy subjects were given Echinacea purpurea root 400 mg four times daily for 8 days with a single 500-mg dose of tolbutamide on day 6. The AUC of tolbutamide was increased by 14%, and the time to maximum levelswas increased from 4 to 6 hours. 1The oral clearance was decreased by a mean of 11%, although 2 subjects had a 25% or greaterreduction. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism No mechanism expected. Importance and management This one study suggests that echinacea does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide, and therefore no tolbutamide dosage adjustments appear necessary if echinacea is also taken. Tolbutamide is used as a probe substrate for CYP2C9, and therefore these results also suggest that a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between echinacea and other CYP2C9substrates is unlikely. 1.

The leaves and stem contain luteolin, and the desmethylwedelolactone, as well as theirglucosides, are present throughout the herb. Oleanane-typetriterpenoids known as the ecliptasaponins, eclalbatin andthe eclalbasaponins (based alkaloids based on verazine and ecliptalbine, are also found in eclipta. Use and indications Eclipta is traditionally used for blood-related diseases,including liver diseases such as hepatitis and jaundice.Pharmacological studies support these uses to some extent, but clinical data are lacking. It has also been used for alopecia, as an antiseptic and as an analgesic; its analgesiceffects have been attributed to the alkaloid content. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found.

(Caprifoliaceae) Synonym(s) and related species Black elder, European elder, Sambucus. Not to be confused with American elder, which is Sambucus canadensis L. Pharmacopoeias Elder Flower ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The flowers and berries of elder are most often used medicinally. The flowers contain: The unripe berries of eldercontain toxic constituents, but these are lost on drying and/orheating, and are not present in the medicinal product. Elderextracts may be standardised to contain 0.8% flavonoids based on isoquercitroside ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ).Use and indications Elder extracts are used mainly to treat colds and flu. Severalin vitro studies have shown that elder berry constituents have antidiabetic, antiviral and immune-modulating effects,enhance cytokine production and activate phagocytes, but clinical data are lacking. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids found in elder,see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview There is some very weak experimental evidence to suggestthat elder extracts may have additive effects with antidiabeticdrugs and phenobarbital, and may antagonise the effects ofmorphine. For information on the interactions of individual flavonoids found in elder, see under flavonoids, page 186.E 172Elder + Antidiabetics The interaction between elder and antidiabetics is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an in vitro study, it was found that an aqueous elder flower extract enhanced glucose uptake by 70%, but had no additional effect on glucose uptake when insulin was also given. The extract alsostimulated insulin secretion and glycogen synthesis. 1 Mechanism Elder is thought to enhance insulin secretion in a similar manner to the sulphonylureas. This study supports this suggestion as it found that diazoxide inhibited the effects of elder. Importance and management The in vitro study provides limited evidence of a possible blood- glucose-lowering effect of an aqueous elder flower extract. Because of the nature of the evidence, applying these results in a clinicalsetting is extremely difficult, and the effect of elder flower extractsgiven with conventional antidiabetic medication is unknown. However, if patients taking antidiabetic drugs want to take elder it may be prudent to discuss the potential for additive effects, andadvise an increase in blood-glucose monitoring, should an inter-action be suspected. 1.

Elder + Morphine The interaction between elder and morphine is based onexperimental evidence only.Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in ratsaqueous extracts of elder flower and elder berry were found to modestly decrease the analgesic effects of morphine 90 minutes after dosing. The elder extracts had no effect on theanalgesic response to morphine at a subsequent time point(150 minutes), and had tended to increase the effects of morphine10 minutes after dosing. The berry and flower extracts had noanalgesic effect when given alone. 1 Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between extracts of elder flower and elder berry and morphine appears to be limited to this study in rats, which found only a modest decrease in analgesic effects at just onetime point. It is unknown if this effect would occur in humans, but, even if it does, it seems unlikely to be of much clinical relevance. 1. Jakovljevi V , Popovi M, Mimica-Duki N, Sabo J.

Constituents The main active components of ephedra are the amines (sometimes referred to as include the diterpenes ephedrannin A andmahuannin, and a of volatile oil containingterpinen-4-ol, -terpineol, linalool and other monoterpenes. Use and indications Ephedra is used traditionally for asthma, bronchitis, hayfeverand colds, but recently the herb has become liable to abuse as a stimulant and slimming aid. For this reason the herb has been banned by the FDA in the US. Its main activeconstituents are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine; however, ephedra herb is claimed to have many more effects than those ascribed to ephedrine and its derivatives. It is thesecompounds that also give rise to the toxic effects of ephedra. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview Ephedra herb contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, andtherefore has the potential to interact in the same manner as conventional medicines containing these substances. The most notable of these interactions is the potential forhypertensive crises with MAOIs; it would therefore seemunwise to take ephedra during, or for 2 weeks after, the use of an MAOI. There do not seem to be any reports of drug interactions for ephedra itself, with the exception of caffeine.E 175Ephedra + Caffeine Ephedrine can raise blood pressure and in some cases this may be further increased by caffeine. Combined use has resulted inhypertensive crises in a few individuals. Isolated reports describethe development of acute psychosis when caffeine was given withephedra. Clinical evidence A review of reports from the FDA in the US revealed that several patients have experienced severe adverse effects (subarachnoid haemorrhage, cardiac arrest, hypertension, tachycardia and neurosis)after taking dietary supplements containing ephedrine or ephedraalkaloids with caffeine. 1However, it is not possible to definitively say that these effects were the result of an interaction because noneof the patients took either drug separately. Similarly, a meta-analysisassessing the safety of ephedra or ephedrine and caffeine found a two- to threefold increase in the risk of adverse events (including psychiatric symptoms and palpitations) with ephedra or ephedrine,but concluded that it was not possible to assess the contribution ofcaffeine to these events. 2 Two episodes of acute psychosis occurred in a 32-year-old man after he took Vigueur fit tablets (containing ephedra alkaloids and caffeine), Red Bull (containing caffeine) and alcohol. He had no previous record of aberrant behaviour despite regularly taking 6 to 9 tablets of Vigueur fit daily (about twice the recommended dose). However, on this occasion, over a 10-hour period, he consumed 3 or 4 bottles of Red Bull (containing about 95 mg of caffeine per 250-mL bottle) and enough alcohol to reach a blood-alcohol level of about335 mg%. No more episodes occurred after he stopped taking theVigueur fit tablets. Ephedra alkaloids (ephedrine and pseudoephe- drine) may cause psychosis and it appears that their effects may beexaggerated by an interaction with caffeine and alcohol. 3In another case report, an ischaemic stroke that occurred in a 33-year-old manwas thought to be due to taking a supplement called Thermadrene , (now reformulated, but which at the time contained ephedrine,guarana, caffeine, cayenne pepper and willow bark). The use ofbupropion may have been a contributory factor. 4A similar case of stroke is reported in a man who took a creatine supplement with ephedra plus caffeine. In this case, the interaction was attributed to creatine . See Creatine + Herbal medicines; Ephedra with Caffeine, page 157. Experimental evidence In a study, ratswere given an oral solution of ephedra (containing up to 50 mg/kg ephedrine) with, and without, caffeine. Ephedra with caffeine increased the clinical signs of toxicity (salivation, hyper-activity, ataxia, lethargy, failure to respond to stimuli) in the treated rats, when compared with ephedra alone. Histological analysis for cardiotoxicity showed some evidence of haemorrhage, necrosis, and tissue degeneration within 2 to 4 hours of treatment. No statisticaldifference in the occurrence of cardiotoxic lesions was found whenanimals treated with ephedrine were compared with those treated with ephedra, indicating that the cardiotoxic effects of ephedra aredue to ephedrine. 5 Another study also reported that cardiac toxicity was observed in 7- and 14-week-old male ratsadministered ephedrine (25 mg/kg) incombination with caffeine (30 mg/kg) for one or two days. Theephedrine and caffeine dosage was approximately 12-fold and1.4-fold, respectively, above average human exposure. Five of the seven treated 14-week-old ratsdied or were sacrificed 4 to 5 hours after the first dose, and massive interstitial haemorrhage was reported. 6 Mechanism Ephedrine and caffeine may cause catecholamine release and an increase in intracellular calcium release which leads to vasoconstric-tion. Myocardial ischaemia may occur as a result of this vasoconstriction (in the coronary artery), and this may result in myocardial necrosis and cell death. 5,6 Importance and management The interaction between ephedra alkaloids and caffeine is fairly well established. However, it has to be said that there seem to be fewreports of adverse interactions specifically with ephedra alkaloids. One possible explanation for this could be that these interactions may go unrecognised or be attributed to one drug only, whereascaffeine may also have been taken either as part of the preparation orin beverages or foods (often not reported). Nevertheless, a number ofserious adverse events have been reported and these preparationsmay pose a serious health risk to some users. The risk may beaffected by individual susceptibility, the additive stimulant effects ofcaffeine, the variability in the contents of alkaloids or pre-existing medical conditions. 1 Note that the FDA has banned combinations of caffeine and herbal products containing ephedra. It would seem prudent to avoid concurrent use. 1. Haller CA, Benowitz NL. Adverse cardiovascular and central nervous system events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids.

There is some taxonomic confusion within the species, and most of the commercially available material has not been properly characterised. In Chinese medicine, a mixture of species (referred to as Herba Epimedii) is often used and includes the following species (some of which may wushanense T.S.Ying. Constituents The major constituents of all species of epimedium are prenylated flavonoids andisoflavones : the most important C, and 6-prenylchrysin. Apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol and quercetin are also present. A multitude of other constituents, for which the pharmaceutical relevance is unclear, have been identified. Use and indications Epimedium is used traditionally as an antirheumatic, tonicand to enhance bone health and treat osteoporosis. Theisoflavones and prenylated flavones have oestrogenicactivity. The herb is also used to enhance sexual function. Legendhas it that this use was discovered after a goat herd in Chinafound that his animals became much more sexually active after eating the herb, hence the name horny goat weed. It has therefore been widely advertised as a 'herbal Viagra '. Pharmacokinetics In vitro, freeze-dried aqueous extracts of Herba Epimediihave been found to inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, an effect thought to be related to the quercetin content of the herb. 1Extracts of Herba Epimedii may inhibit CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6, 1but the clinical relevance of this has not been established.

Epimedium + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Epimedium + Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors The interaction between epimedium and phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study using rabbit corpus cavernosum tissue found that an aqueous extract of Epimedium brevicornum relaxed the smoothmuscle of the corpus cavernosum. The extract also enhanced the relaxation caused by sildenafil ,tadalafil andvardenafil .1 Mechanism Epimedium appears to have a similar mode of action to the phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors. In vitro , an extract of Epimedium brevicornum and one of its constituents, icariin, have been found to inhibit phosphodiesterase type-5, although both hadweaker effects than sildenafil. 2 Importance and management Evidence is limited to experimental studies, but what is known suggests that epimedium may potentiate the effects of thephosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, sildenafil, tadalafil and varde-nafil. The results of in vitro studies are difficult to reliably extrapolate to humans. Nevertheless, the concurrent use ofepimedium and a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor could poten-tially lead to additive effects, which may be beneficial, but which could in theory also lead to adverse effects, such as priapism. It would therefore seem prudent to discuss concurrent use withpatients, and warn them of the potential risks. Note that it isgenerally recommended that other agents for erectile dysfunctionshould be avoided in those taking sildenafil, tadalafil or 1.

Potent inhibition of human phosphodiesterase-5 by icariin derivatives. Nat species Common evening BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The oil from evening primrose seeds contains the essential fatty acids of the omega-6 series, linoleic acid (about 65 to 85%) and gamolenic acid (gamma-linolenic acid, about 7 to 14%). Other fatty acids include oleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid. Use and indications Evening primrose oil is used as a food supplement to provide essential fatty acids. It is also used for atopic eczema andmastalgia; however, in the UK licences for two prescriptionproducts containing gamolenic acid derived from evening primrose oil were withdrawn in 2002, due to lack of evidence in support of efficacy. Other conditions for which it is used include rheumatoid arthritis, premenstrual syndrome, menopausal symptoms, chronic fatigue syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Evening primrose oil has also been used topicallyas a cream, for the relief of dry or inflamed skin.Traditionally it has been used for asthma, whooping cough, gastrointestinal disorders, and as a sedative painkiller. In manufacturing, evening primrose oil is used in soaps and cosmetics. The root of evening primrose has been usedas a vegetable. Pharmacokinetics Inin vitro experiments,1cis-linoleic acid, was found to be a modest inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP2C9 (but this is not expected to result in clinically relevant effects on drug metabolism, see warfarin and relateddrugs, page 181), and a modest to minor inhibitor of, in order of potency, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Interactions overview Evening primrose oil has been predicted to interact withantiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs, but data supporting this prediction are limited. Although seizures have occurred in afew schizophrenics taking phenothiazines and eveningprimrose oil, no adverse effects were seen in others, and there appears to be no firm evidence that evening primrose oil should be avoided by epileptic patients. 1. Zou L, Harkey MR, Henderson GL. Effects of herbal components on cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. Life 179Evening primrose oil + Antiplatelet drugs Evening primrose oil can inhibit platelet aggregation and increase bleeding time. It has therefore been suggested that it may have additive effects with other antiplatelet drugs, butevidence of this is generally lacking. Clinical evidence In 12 patients with hyperlipidaemia given evening primrose oil 3 g daily for 4 months, platelet aggregation decreased and bleeding timeincreased by 40%. The evening primrose oil was given in the form of six 500-mg soft-gel capsules and the daily dose contained linoleic acid 2.2 g and gamolenic acid 240 mg.1 Experimental evidence Similar findings to the clinical study above have been reported in animals given evening primrose oil or gamolenic acid .1,2 Mechanism Prostaglandin E 1(which has antiplatelet properties) and thrombox- ane (which promotes platelet aggregation) are formed from gamolenic acid. Supplementing the diet with gamolenic acid hasbeen shown to augment the production of prostaglandin E 1and, because prostaglandin E 1is also preferentially formed (the conver- sion of gamolenic acid thromboxane is slower), evening primroseoil could inhibit platelet aggregation. This effect could be additive with the effects of other antiplatelet drugs. Importance and management Information is limited to one clinical study, in which patients were not taking conventional antiplatelet drugs, and experimental data.Based on the potential antiplatelet effects of evening primrose oil,some authors 3suggest that patients taking antiplatelet drugs should use evening primrose oil cautiously or not at all. This seems overly cautious because evening primrose oil is a widely used herbal product, and was formerly used as a prescription product in the UK,and clinical reports of an interaction have yet to come to light.Furthermore, the concurrent use of two conventional antiplateletdrugs is not uncommon. 1.

Evening primrose oil + Food No interactions found. Evening primrose oil + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Evening primrose oil + NSAIDs The interaction between evening primrose oil and NSAIDs is based on a prediction only.Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Gamolenic acid , a major constituent of evening primrose oil, is a precursor of prostaglandin E 1, which inhibits the synthesis of tumour necrosis factor- (which has an important effect in the inflammatory processes of rheumatoid arthritis). Supplementing the diet with gamolenic acid has been shown to augment the production of prostaglandin E 1, which has a rate-limiting step mediated by cyclooxygenase-2. Theoretically, the production of prostaglandin E 1, and therefore the anti-inflammatory effects of gamolenic acid , could be opposed by the concurrent use of NSAIDs because both selectiveand non-selective NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase-2. 1However, evening primrose oil is often used alongside conventional treatments for arthritis and two clinical studies found that high doses of gamolenic acid reduced pain and swelling of the joints of arthritic patients when given with usual doses of NSAIDs. This theoretical interaction therefore appears to be of little clinical importance.2,3 1. Kast RE.

Evening primrose oil + Phenothiazines Although seizures have occurred in a few schizophrenics taking phenothiazines and evening primrose oil, no adverse effects wereseen in others, and there appears to be no firm evidence that evening primrose oil should be avoided by epileptic patients. Clinical evidence Twenty-three patients were enrolled in a placebo-controlled study of evening primrose oil in schizophrenia. During the treatment phase,patients were given 8 capsules of Efamol in addition to their normal medication. Seizures developed in 3 patients, one during treatmentwith placebo. The other two patients were taking evening primrose oil: one was receiving fluphenazine decanoate 50 mg once every 2 weeks and the other fluphenazine decanoate 25 mg once every 2 weeks with thioridazine , which was later changed to chlorproma- zine.1In another study, 3 long-stay hospitalised schizophrenics were taking evening primrose oil. Their schizophrenia became much worse and all 3 patients showed EEG evidence of temporal lobeepilepsy. 2 In contrast, no seizures or epileptiform events were reported in a crossover study in 48 patients (most of them schizophrenics) taking phenothiazines when they were given evening primrose oil for 4 months.3Concurrent use was also apparently uneventful in another study in schizophrenic patients.4 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Not understood. One suggestion is that evening primrose oil possibly increases the well-recognised epileptogenic effects of thephenothiazines, rather than having an epileptogenic action of itsown. 1Another idea is that it might unmask temporal lobe epilepsy.1,2 Importance and management The interaction between phenothiazines and evening primrose oil is not well established, nor is its incidence known, but clearly somecaution is appropriate during concurrent use, because seizures maydevelop in a few individuals. There seems to be no way ofidentifying the patients at particular risk. The extent to which theunderlying disease condition might affect what happens is alsounclear. No interaction between antiepileptics and evening primrose oil has been established and the reports cited above 1,2appear to be the180 Evening primrose oil Esole basis for the suggestion that evening primrose oil should be avoided by epileptics. No seizures appear to have been reported inpatients taking evening primrose oil in the absence of phenothia- zines. One review, 5analysing these two reports, goes as far as suggesting that formularies should now remove seizures or epilepsy as an adverse effect of evening primrose oil because the evidence forthe seizures clearly point to the phenothiazines taken. Moreover, themanufacturers of Epogam , an evening primrose oil preparation, claim that it is known to have improved the control of epilepsy inpatients previously uncontrolled with conventional antiepilepticdrugs, and other patients are said to have had no problems during concurrent treatment. 6 1.

Evening primrose oil + Warfarin and related drugs The information regarding the use of evening primrose oil with warfarin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found.Experimental evidenceIn vitro ,cis-linoleic acid was found to be a moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, which is the main isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of warfarin. However, it was 26-fold lesspotent than sulfaphenazole, 1a drug known to have clinically relevant inhibitory effects on CYP2C9 in vivo. Mechanism Prostaglandin E 1(which has antiplatelet properties) and thrombox- ane (which promotes platelet aggregation) are formed from gamolenic acid. Supplementing the diet with gamolenic acid hasbeen shown to augment the production of prostaglandin E 1and, because prostaglandin E 1is also preferentially formed (the conver- sion of gamolenic acid thromboxane is slower), evening primroseoil could inhibit platelet aggregation. This effect could slightly increase the risk of bleeding with anticoagulants. Importance and management Evening primrose oil seems unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Other coumarins are metabolised by a similar route to warfarin, and are therefore also unlikely to be affected. However,based on the potential antiplatelet effects of evening primrose oil,some authors 2suggest that patients taking anticoagulants should use evening primrose oil cautiously or not at all. This seems overlycautious because evening primrose oil is a widely used herbal product, and was formerly used as a prescription product in the UK, and clinical reports of an interaction have yet to come to light. 1.

Constituents Fenugreek seeds are about 25% protein (particularly lysine and tryptophan) and coumarins and vitamins (nicotinic acid) are also present. Use and indications The seeds of fenugreek have been used as an appetite stimulant and for digestive disorders (including constipation,dyspepsia and gastritis). It has also been used in respiratorydisorders and is said to be an expectorant. Topically,fenugreek has been used for wounds and leg ulcers, and as an emollient. It has been reported to have hypocholester- olaemic and hypoglycaemic activity. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found.

For information on the interactions of individual flavonoids present in fenugreek, see underflavonoids, page 186. F 182Fenugreek + Antidiabetics In one study, fenugreek saponins had modest additional antidiabetic effects when they were added to establishedtreatment with sulfonylureas. Clinical evidence Fenugreek seed appears to have been widely studied for its blood- glucose-lowering properties; however, studies on its effects incombination with conventional treatments for diabetes appear limited. In one randomised study, 146 patients taking sulfonylureas (not named), with fasting blood-glucose levels of 7 to 13 mmol/L, were given fenugreek saponins 2.1 g three times daily after meals for 12 weeks. When compared with 23 similar patients given placebo itwas found that fenugreek saponins decreased fasting blood-glucose levels by 23% (8.38 mmol/L versus 6.79 mmol/L). Diabetic controlwas also improved: glycosylated haemoglobin levels were about 20% lower in the treatment group (8.2% versus 6.56%). The fenugreek saponin preparation was an extract of total saponins of fenugreek given as capsules containing 0.35 mg per capsule, equivalent to 5.6 g of crude fenugreek. Experimental evidence The blood-glucose-lowering activity of fenugreek and its extracts has been well studied in animal models; however, there appear to be no data directly relating to interactions. Mechanism It is suggested that fenugreek decreases blood-glucose levels by affecting an insulin signalling pathway. Importance and management Evidence on the use of fenugreek with conventional antidiabeticmedicines appears to be limited to this one study, which suggests that fenugreek may have some modest additional blood-glucose-lowering effects to those of the sulfonylureas. As these modest effects were apparent over a period of 12 weeks it seems unlikely that a dramatic hypoglycaemic effect will occur. 1. Lu F, Shen L, Qin Y , Gao L, Li H, Dai Y .

Constituents The leaf and contain sesquiterpene lactones, especially parthenolide artemorin, partholide, chrysanthemo-nin and others. The acetate, bornyl angelate, and indications Feverfew is mainly used for the prophylactic treatment of migraine and tension headache, but it has antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory activity, and has been used for coughs,colds and rheumatic conditions. It can cause allergic andcytotoxic reactions due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones with an -methylene butyrolactone ring, as in parthenolide.Pharmacokinetics In a study investigating the in vitro inhibitory potency of an extract of feverfew using a commercially available mixture of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, and established substratesof these isoenzymes, the CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. 1The findings of in vitro studies cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, but positive findings such as thesesuggest that further study is required. In an in vitro study, the transport of parthenolide, a constituent of feverfew, was not affected by the presence ofMK-571, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. 2 Interactions overview Feverfew inhibits platelet aggregation in vitro and, theor- etically, might increase the risk of bleeding in patients takingother drugs that increase bleeding such as aspirin or anticoagulants. 1.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management The manufacturer1advises that feverfew as a herbal medicine may theoretically interact with warfarin and increase the risk of bleeding on the basis of its in vitro antiplatelet effects (see Feverfew + Antiplatelet drugs, below). However, they note that the clinical relevance of this in vivo is unknown.2Some reviews also note this potential for an interaction and suggest that concurrent use should be avoided.3Clinically the use of an antiplatelet drug with an anticoagulant should generally be avoided in the absence of aspecific indication. It may therefore be prudent to advise againstconcurrent use. However, if concurrent use is felt desirable, the risksand benefits of treatment should be considered. It would seem sensible to warn patients to be alert for any signs of bruising or bleeding, and report these immediately, should they occur. 1. Migraherb (Feverfew herb). MH Pharma (UK) Ltd.

Clinical evidence A letter briefly describes a study in which platelet aggregation was assessed in samples taken from 10 patients who had taken feverfewfor at least 3.5 years. The platelets aggregated normally in responseto thrombin and ADP; however, the serotonin and U46619 (a thromboxane mimetic) was attenuated, and occurred only at higher doses. 1 Experimental evidence In a number of early in vitro studies, mostly by the same research group, feverfew was found to inhibit platelet aggregation.2-8In these studies, inhibited of arachidonic acid.3,5,6Parthenolide, a constituent of feverfew, has also been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro .8 Mechanism Unclear. It was suggested that the mechanism of platelet inhibition isneutralisation of sulfhydryl groups within the platelets, although the exact sulfhydryl groups involved still need to be defined.2 Importance and management There appears to be only one clinical study, which does not wholly substantiate the in vitro findings that feverfew inhibits platelet aggregation in response to certain chemical stimuli. However, thestudy does support the finding of somewhat reduced plateletresponsiveness. It could be argued that any interaction shouldhave come to light by now, since feverfew has been in fairlywidespread use for the management of migraines, and, in this setting, it is likely to have been taken with aspirin and NSAIDs. On the other hand, the small increased risk of bleeding with low-doseaspirin has required very large retrospective comparisons toestablish. Concurrent use need not be avoided (indeed combinationsof antiplatelet drugs are often prescribed together) but it may beprudent to be aware of the potential for increased bleeding iffeverfew is given with other antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel. Patients should discuss any episode of prolonged bleeding with a healthcare professional. 1. Biggs MJ, Johnson ES, Persaud NP, Ratcliffe DM.

They are the subject ofintensive investigations and new information is constantly being published. You may have come to this monograph via a herb that contains flavonoids. Note that the information in this general monograph relates to the individual flavonoids, and the reader is referred back to the herb (and vice versa ) where appropriate. It is very difficult to confidently predict whether a herb that contains one of the flavonoids mentioned willinteract in the same way. The levels of the flavonoid in the particular herb can vary a great deal between specimens, related species, extracts and brands, and it is important totake this into account when viewing the interactionsdescribed below. Types, sources and related compounds Flavonoids are a very large family of polyphenolic com-pounds synthesised by plants that are common and widely distributed. With the exception of the flavanols (e.g. catechins) and their polymers, the proanthocyanidins, theyusually occur naturally bound to one or more sugarmolecules (flavonoid glycosides) rather than as the free aglycones. The sub-groups of flavonoids, their main repre- sentatives, and are as follows: . Flavones: e.g. apigenin, luteolin; found in celery, page 123, and parsley, page 304. The rind of citrus fruits is rich in the polymethoxylated and onions. Rutin (sophorin), also known as quercetin-3-rutinoside, is .Flavanones: hesperetin (from and theirglycosides, hesperidin, naringin and eriocitrin. They are most concentrated in the membranes separating the fruitsegments and the white spongy part of the peel. Flavanone glycosides are often present in supplements as citrus bioflavonoids .Flavanols (Flavan-3-ols): epicatechins and gallic acid esters of epicatechins; found in teas, page 382, (particu- larly green and white), cocoa, page 139, grapes, berries,and apples. Dimers, e.g. theaflavins and gallic acid estersof theaflavins, and thearubigins also found in teas,page 382 (particularly black and oolong). Proanthocya- nidins are polymers of flavanols, also known as con- tannins, the most frequent being procyanidins (polymers of catechin and epicatechin). Found widely in cocoa, page 139, some berries and nuts, hops, page 251 and grapeseed, page 239. choc- olate, apples, red, blue and purple berries, red and purple grapes, and red wine. .Isoflavones (Isoflavonoids): are a distinct group of flavonoids with phytoestrogenic effects and are con-sidered elsewhere, see isoflavones, page 258. Use and indications Some prospective cohort studies show that a high dietaryintake of flavonoid-rich foods is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, 1,2but they do not all show this effect.3Other cohort and case- control studies show a reduced risk of some cancers.4However, there do not appear to be any studies to show whether isolated flavonoidsupplements confer similar benefits to flavonoid-rich foods. Many beneficial properties have been identified for flavonoids, one of the most popularly cited being their antioxidant activity. Other actions that are proposed to contribute to their biological effects include chelating metalions, stimulating phase II detoxifying enzyme activity,inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis, reducing inflammation, decreasing cell adhesion molecule expression, increasing nitric platelet aggregation. Pharmacokinetics The bioavailability of flavonoids is relatively low due to limited absorption and rapid elimination, and they are generally rapidly and extensively metabolised.5,6Flavonoid esters, glycosides or polymers require hydrolysis to the freeaglycone before absorption, and this occurs by intestinal enzymes (e.g. beta-glucosidases) and colonic bacteria. During absorption, the aglycone bysulfation, glucuronidation or methylation. These conjugatesare excreted back into the intestine by efflux pumps. Those absorbed are eventually excreted in the urine and bile, and may undergo enterohepatic recycling. 5,6It appears that metabolism of flavonoids by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes is probably minor compared with conjugation reactions for flavonoids.5 The potential for flavonoids to alter drug metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, in particular, and alsoF 186intestinal and hepatic drug transporters, such as P-glycopro- tein, has been extensively investigated in vitro .5,7There are also some animal studies, but few human clinical pharmacokinetic studies, and those that are available havegenerally used very high doses of the flavonoids. There is at present no reason to avoid flavonoids in the diet, or in the form of herbal medicines (most of whichcontain significant amounts of flavonoids naturally), andmany positive reasons for including them. However, very high doses (such as the use of specific flavonoid supple- ments) could potentially alter the metabolism of other are substrates for CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein, andincrease the bioavailability of some drugs; for instance the statins, page 194, such as lovastatin and simvastatin; ciclosporin, page 190; benzodiazepines, page 189, such asmidazolam; and digoxin, page 191. Interactions overview The interactions covered in this monograph relate toindividual flavonoids. It may be possible to directly extrapolate some of these interactions to some flavonoid supplements, especially those regarding quercetin; however,caution must be taken when applying these interactions toherbs or foods known to contain the flavonoid in question. This is because the amount of the flavonoid found in the herb or food must be considered (this can be highly variable,and might not be known) and the other constituents present in the herb or food might affect the bioavailability or activity of the flavonoid (information that is usually unknown).Therefore, although data on isolated flavonoids are useful, itis no substitute for direct studies of the herb, food or dietary supplement in question. 1.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Findings from an in vitro study suggest that quercetin might modestly increase the absorption of oral aciclovir by inhibiting intestinal P-glycoprotein. The effect of high-dose quercetin (80 mg/L) was equivalent to that of verapamil 10 mg/L,1which is an established, clinically relevant inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.However, because aciclovir has a wide therapeutic index, even ifthis change is seen in practice, it is unlikely to be clinicallyimportant. 1.

Flavonoids + Antibacterials The interaction between flavonoids and antibacterials is basedon experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management (a) Aminoglycosides In a study, ratswere given either the aglycone baicalein or the parent flavone baicalin orally. The bioavailability of baicalein from the parent flavone was reduced from 28% to about 8% in rats given neomycin andstreptomycin , when compared with rats not given these antibacterials, but the antibacterials did not affect the bioavailability of administered baicalein .1 These antibacterials decimate colonic bacteria, which are involved in the hydrolysis of baicalin tobaicalein . This study used the combination of neomycin and streptomycin because previous research had shown that this combination was most effective inreducing intestinal microflora, and that a single aminoglycoside didnot have this effect. 1 These findings are likely to have little clinical relevance, because individuals are rarely given combinations of aminoglyco- sides with such potent effects on colonic microflora. It would be of use to know the effect of standard broad-spectrum antibacterials ingeneral clinical use. However, even these are only given for shortcourses, so any reduction in the effect of the flavonoid would beshort-lived. (b) Nitrofurantoin In a study in rats, oral administration of high-dose chrysin 200 mg/ kg increased the AUC of nitrofurantoin by about 76% and decreased its clearance by 42%, whereas low-dose chrysin 50 mg/kg had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of nitrofurantoin.2 Available evidence2suggests that chrysin increases the AUC of nitrofurantoin by inhibition of the transporter protein BCRP. The doses used in this study were much greater than those likely to be encountered clinically, and therefore these data suggest thateven high doses of chrysin used as dietary supplements (e.g. 3 g daily) are unlikely to have a clinically important effect onnitrofurantoin pharmacokinetics. 1.

Clinical evidence There are few clinical studies investigating whether the in vitro antiplatelet effect of flavonoids occurs in humans, and whether this effect could be clinically relevant, and findings are not consistent. Some studies are cited in the following section as examples to illustrate the differences. Antiplatelet effects In one randomised controlled study, a cocoa supplement (234 mg of cocoa flavanols andprocyanidins daily) given for 28 days decreased collagen- and ATP-induced platelet aggregation when compared with placebo.1Similarly, onion soup high in quercetin (one 'dose 'of about 69 mg) inhibited collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation.2 However, in another study, neither dietary supplementation withonions 220 g daily (providing quercetin 114 mg daily) nor supplementation with parsley 4.9 g daily (providing apigenin 84 mg daily) for 7 days affected platelet aggregation or other haemostatic variables.3Similarly, a supplement containing quercetin 1 g daily and other flavonoids did not affect platelet aggregation in a placebo-controlled study in healthy subjects.4 In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, a flavanol -rich cocoa beverage (897 mg total flavonoids in 300 mL) had a similar, but less marked, effect than aspirin 81 mg on adrenaline-stimulated plateletactivation and function. The effect of the cocoa beverage and aspirinappeared to be additive. 5 Experimental evidence Numerous in vitro studies show that many flavonoids, and flavanols andprocyanidin oligomers in particular, inhibit platelet aggrega- tion,6and this has been suggested as a mechanism to explain why some epidemiological studies show that a diet high in flavonoids is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Mechanism Flavonoids might have antiplatelet effects, which, if confirmed, could be additive with other antiplatelet drugs. In addition, they might increase the risk of bleeding when used with anticoagulants. Importance and management There is a large amount of information regarding an interaction between flavonoids and antiplatelet drugs, but an interaction is notestablished. There is a well-established small increased risk of bleeding when aspirin at antiplatelet doses is combined with the anticoagulant drug warfarin. Theoretically, very high intakes offlavonoids (e.g. from supplements) might have similar clinicallyimportant antiplatelet effects, and could therefore increase the risk ofbleeding when taken with any anticoagulant drug, and have additiveeffects with antiplatelet drugs. However, available evidence isconflicting, with some studies showing that a number of flavonoids have antiplatelet effects and others finding no antiplatelet effects. Until more is known, some caution might be appropriate with highdoses of flavonoid supplements. In practice this would mean beingaware of an increased risk of bleeding, and patients being alert forsymptoms of bleeding, such as petechiae and bruising. Modest dosesof flavonoids are unlikely to cause any problems. 1.

Flavonoids + Benzodiazepines In a study, tangerine juice, containing tangeretin, did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. However, grapefruit juice,which contains different flavonoids, does increase levels of somebenzodiazepines. Clinical evidence In a crossover study in 8 healthy subjects, tangerine juice (which contains the flavone tangeretin ) 100 mL, given 15 minutes before and with a single 15-mg dose of oral midazolam , had no effect on the AUC and elimination of midazolam. The only change was a slight delay in midazolam absorption.1 Note that grapefruit juice (a rich source of flavonoids) has a well- established inhibitory effect on the metabolism of some benzodia- zepines, resulting in increased exposure (1.5- to 3.5-fold increase in AUC). Experimental evidence (a) Anxiolytic effect In various animal models, the anxiolytic effects were additive for diazepam andbaicalin of in human liver microsomes.1Con- versely, in another study, quercetin was found to be an inhibitor of the metabolism of midazolam , with kaempferol andnaringenin also having some effect.4 MechanismTheoretically, flavonoids might inhibit P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 this route). Someflavonoids have anxiolytic properties in animal models. Importance and management Contrary to what was predicted from in vitro studies using tangeretin, a single dose of tangerine juice did not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. In contrast, grapefruit juice,which contains different flavonoids, does increase levels of somebenzodiazepines. However, grapefruit juice also affects the levels of some calcium-channel blockers, but studies with the flavonoid naringin have found no interaction, suggesting that naringin is not the primary active constituent of grapefruit juice (see calcium- channel blockers, below). Therefore individual flavonoids might not be anticipated to increase benzodiazepine levels. Furthermore,although evidence is preliminary, it is possible that high doses ofsome individual flavonoids such as hesperidin and baicalin effects with benzodiazepines, suggesting a possible pharmacodynamic interaction. This suggests that, until more is known, some caution might be appropriate if citrus bioflavonoids are used with benzodiazepines, bearing in mind the possibility of increased benzodiazepine effects. 1.

Flavonoids + Caffeine Naringin does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of caffeine. Clinical evidence In a crossover study in 10 healthy subjects, changes in caffeine pharmacokinetics and physiological responses (resting energyexpenditure, oxygen consumption and respiratory exchange ratio)were measured after an acute dose of caffeine 200 mg with orwithout naringin 100 or 200 mg. Naringin did not alter either the pharmacokinetics of caffeine or the physiological responses tocaffeine. 1Note that grapefruit juice (which is a rich source of flavonoids) either does not interact with caffeine2or causes only clinically irrelevant increases in caffeine levels.3 Experimental evidence In contrast to the clinical findings, in vitro evidence suggests that grapefruit juice and naringenin inhibit CYP1A2 activity in human liver microsomes.3Nevertheless, it is not unusual for in vitro effects to be less marked or not apparent when studied in humans. Mechanism Although in vitro studies3have suggested that grapefruit juice and one of its constituents, naringenin, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, this does not appear to occur in humans. Importance and management Although some of the data are conflicting, the balance of evidence suggests that flavonoids such as naringin would not be expected toalter the effects of caffeine or other substrates of CYP1A2 by apharmacokinetic mechanism.

Flavonoids + Calcium-channel blockers Supplements of specific citrus bioflavonoids do not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of calcium-channel blockers to a clinically relevant extent. Clinical evidence (a) Felodipine In a crossover study in 9 healthy subjects, 200 mL of an aqueous solution of naringin 450 micrograms/mL had no effect on the mean AUC of a single 5-mg dose of felodipine. This contrasted with the effect of 200 mL of grapefruit juice (determined to have the same naringin level), which doubled the AUC of felodipine.1In another study, in 12 healthy subjects, the liquid fraction (after centrifugationand filtration) of grapefruit juice , which contained naringin 148 mg, hadlesseffect on the AUC of felodipine than the particulate fraction (the sediment after centrifugation, which contained 7 mg of naringin ; 20-fold less). The AUC of felodipine increased by aboutFlavonoids 189 F50% with the liquid fraction and by about 100% with the particulate fraction.2 (b) Nifedipine In a crossover study in 8 healthy subjects, high-dose quercetin 200 mg given the night before, 100 mg given on waking and 100 mg given with nifedipine 10 mg had no effect on the AUC of nifedipine.This contrasted with the effect of 200 mL of double-strength grapefruit juice (a rich source of flavonoids), which increased the AUC of nifedipine by about 50%.3 (c) Nisoldipine In a crossover study in 12 healthy subjects, the AUC of a single 20- mg dose of nisoldipine was not altered by naringin 185 mg (given simultaneously), but was increased by 75% by 250 mL of grapefruit juice (a rich source of flavonoids).4 Experimental evidence One research group has extensively investigated the effects of various flavonoids on the pharmacokinetics of various oral calcium-channel blockers in rats and rabbits. ( morin of diltiazem (30 to 120%),5,6nimodipine (47 to 77%)7andverapamil (27 to 72%).8-10No effect was seen on the elimination half-life. An interaction occurred when the flavonoidwas given 30 minutes before the calcium-channel blocker, but notwhen it was given simultaneously. 7,10 Mechanism The increased bioavailability of calcium-channel blockers in animals with the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP3A4. However, no had any onthe bioavailability of calcium-channel blockers in humans. It isprobable that furanocoumarins are more important for the grapefruitinteraction in humans, 11see also Natural coumarins + Felodipine, page 300. Importance and management Experimental evidence for an interaction is extensive, but less is known about any interaction between flavonoids and calcium-channel blockers in humans. In contrast to the effect of grapefruitjuice, no individual flavonoid has had any effect on thepharmacokinetics of a calcium-channel blocker in clinical studies (naringin with felodipine, quercetin with nifedipine, naringin with nisoldipine). Although, these flavonoids haveincreased levels of several calcium-channel blockers in animals , the clinical data seem to suggest that this is not applicable tohumans. Supplements of specific citrus bioflavonoids are thereforeunlikely to interact with calcium-channel blockers; however, aninteraction might occur with extracts of grapefruit if these contain constituents other than just the flavonoids (e.g. furanocoumarins such as bergamottin).

Clinical evidence In a study in 8 healthy subjects, a single 300-mg dose of ciclosporin was given four times: alone, with oral quercetin 5 mg/kg, 30 minutes after oral quercetin 5 mg/kg or after a 3-day course of quercetin 5 mg/kg twice daily. It was found that the AUC of ciclosporin wasincreased by 16% when given with a single dose of quercetin ,b y 36% when given after single-dose quercetin and by 46% when given after multiple-dose quercetin .1 Experimental evidence (a) Nephrotoxicity There are some data suggesting that flavonoids might reduce the renal toxicity of ciclosporin. For example, in one study in rats, quercetin given with ciclosporin for 21 days attenuated the renal impairment and morphological changes (such as interstitial fibrosis),when compared with ciclosporin alone. 2 (b) Pharmacokinetics In contrast to the clinical evidence above, in an animal study, giving single doses of oral ciclosporin with quercetin 50 mg/kg resulted in a 43% and 42% decrease in the AUC of ciclosporin in ratsandpigs, respectively (note, this did not reach statistical significance in pigs).3 In a further study in rats, onion (which is a rich source of quercetin ) caused a 68% reduction in the levels of ciclosporin given orally, but had no effect on the AUC of ciclosporin given intravenously.4 Similarly, in another study, morin decreased levels of ciclosporin in blood by a modest 33%, and also decreased levels in other tissues(by 17% to 45%). However, despite this reduction, the ciclosporin-suppressed Th1 immune response was not reduced by morin .5 In yet another study, the individual flavonoids baicalin and baicalein markedly increased ciclosporin levels in rats, whereas the root of baical skullcap, which contains these flavonoids, decreased the AUC of ciclosporin by up to 82%.6Inrats, ciclosporin halved the AUC of baicalin in blood, and increased its levels in bile by about 60%.7 Mechanism Flavonoids might affect ciclosporin levels by their effects on P-glycoprotein or the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4.Inanimal studies both increased and decreased levels have been seen. 3-6 Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between flavonoids and ciclosporin is largely limited to experimental data. In the one clinical study, high-dose quercetin modestly increased ciclosporin levels. The interactionis not sufficiently severe to suggest that concurrent use should beavoided; however, it may make ciclosporin levels less stable as the quercetin content of different herbs and preparations is likely to vary. Concurrent use may therefore be undesirable. If concurrent use ofciclosporin and a quercetin-containing product is undertaken itshould be monitored well. Inanimal studies, both increases and decreases in ciclosporin levels have been seen with individual flavonoids. Until more isknown, it may be prudent to be cautious with any flavonoid supplement and ciclosporin, especially those containing high doses. Although the reduced nephrotoxicity is interesting, this has to be190 Flavonoids Fviewed in the context of possible adverse pharmacokinetic inter- actions. 1. Choi JS, Choi BC, Choi KE.

Pharmacokinetics of baicalin in rats and its interactions with cyclosporin A, quinidine and SKF-525A: a microdialysis + Digoxin The interaction between flavonoids and digoxin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in pigs, three animals were given digoxin 20 micrograms/ kg with quercetin 50 mg/kg and three animals were given digoxin alone. Unexpectedly, two of the pigsreceiving the combination died suddenly within 30 minutes. At 20 minutes, the serum digoxin levels of the animals receiving the combination were 2.6-fold higher than those in the animals given digoxin alone (6.73 nanograms/mL versus 2.54 nanograms/mL).1In a further crossover study in 4 pigs, quercetin at a slightly lower dose of 40 mg/kg increased the maximum level of digoxin fivefold and the AUC 2.7-fold.1The authors state that they specifically chose pigs for this study, as a preliminary study suggested that the pharmacokinetics of digoxin inpigs were similar to that in humans. Mechanism Quercetin is suspected to increase the oral absorption of digoxin by inhibiting intestinal P-glycoprotein. A study investigating the effectsof kaempferol derivatives isolated from Zingiber zerumbet , a species related to ginger, found that some of these derivatives inhibited P-glycoprotein, with a potency similar to verapamil, a known clinically relevant P-glycoprotein inhibitor.2Kaempferol may there- fore also raise digoxin levels. Importance and management Although there is just one animal study of quercetin, its findings of markedly increased levels of digoxin and toxicity suggest that caution would be appropriate with supplements containing quercetin in patients taking digoxin until further data become available. Monitor for digoxin adverse effects, such as bradycardia, andconsider measuring digoxin levels if this occurs. Note that there is currently no evidence of any clinically important interactions between digoxin and food, even for foodsknown to be rich sources of quercetin such as onions (about 7 to34 mg/100 g), 3which suggests that any interaction might require very high doses. The only possible evidence identified was one early pharmacokinetic paper, which reported a modest 43% increase in the peak level of digoxin after administration of acetyldigoxin withcarob seed flour, 4which is also a rich source of quercetin (about 39 mg/100 g).3 1.

Flavonoids + Enalapril The interaction between flavonoids and enalapril is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Inrats, oral kaempferol 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg given with enalapril increased the AUC of enalaprilat (the active metabolite of enalapril) by 60% and 109%, respectively, but only the effect with 10 mg/kgwas statistically significant. Naringenin 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg caused only a minor 18 to 38% increase in AUC of enalaprilat, which was not statistically significant.1 Mechanism In vitro , both kaempferol and naringenin were shown to be in the gut: esterase may be expected to increase thestability of enalapril, increasing its absorption. 1 Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this experimental study. The effect of kaempferol would not be expected to be clinically importantbecause enalapril has a wide therapeutic range. Naringenin does notappear to interact. No dosage adjustments would therefore beexpected to be needed if either of these flavonoids is given withenalapril. 1. Li P, Callery PS, Gan L-S, Balani SK. Esterase inhibition by grapefruit juice flavonoids leading to a new drug interaction. Drug Metab Dispos (2007) 35, 1203 -8. Flavonoids + Etoposide The interaction between flavonoids and etoposide is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an in vitro study using ratgut sacs ,pre-treatment with quercetin or a natural diet (assumed to contain flavonoids) for 30 minutes increased etoposide absorption when compared with a flavonoid-freediet. However, there was no difference in etoposide absorption when rats were pretreated for one week with a natural diet (assumed to contain flavonoids) compared with a flavonoid-free diet. 1 In another animal study, oral morin given 30 minutes before etoposide increased the AUC of oral etoposide by about 46% but had no effect on the AUC of intravenous etoposide.2 Mechanism It is suggested that inhibit P-glycoprotein or the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 in the gut, and thereby increase the absorption of etoposide, which is a substrate ofCYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein. Importance and management A finding of a 50% increase in the AUC of etoposide might be clinically relevant in humans. However, these are animal data, and therefore some caution is required in extrapolating their findings.Also, the data suggest that the effect of continued use over one weekFlavonoids 191 Fmight have little effect. Further study is needed before any specific recommendations can be made. 1. Lo Y-L, Huang J-D. Comparison of effects of natural or artificial rodent diet on etoposide absorption in rats.

Clinical evidence In a crossover study in 12 healthy subjects, fexofenadine 120 mg was given with either 300 mL of grapefruit juice, an aqueoussolution of naringin at roughly the same concentration found in the juice (1 210 micromol), or water. The AUC of fexofenadine with grapefruit juice and naringin solution was reduced by 45% and 25%, respectively, when compared with water.1 In another study in 12 healthy subjects, fexofenadine was given with grapefruit juice, or water, at the same time, or 2 hours before, an aqueous suspension of the particulate fraction of grapefruit juice.The particulate fraction (i.e. the solid matter after centrifugation ofthe juice) is known to be rich in furanocoumarins, which are clinical inhibitors of intestinal CYP3A4, but relatively low in naringin (34 micromol). The AUC of fexofenadine was reduced by 43% by grapefruit juice, but was not affected by the particulate fraction(when compared with water). 1 Experimental evidence Anin vitro study found that the flavonoids in grapefruit ( naringin ) and orange intestinal OATP authors suggested that naringin directly oral fexofenadine bioavailability, and thatinactivation of enteric CYP3A4 was probably not involved. 1 Importance and management The small 25% reduction in AUC of fexofenadine with a high concentration of naringin is unlikely to be clinically important. Nointeraction would therefore be expected with naringin supplements.However, note that grapefruit juice and other fruit juices might causeclinically relevant reductions in fexofenadine levels in someindividuals. See the table Summary of established drug interactionsof grapefruit juice, page 236. Therefore an interaction with otherextracts from these juices cannot be ruled out. 1.

Flavonoids + Food; Milk The addition of milk to tea did not alter the absorption of quercetin or kaempferol, or catechins, see Tea + Food, page 385. Flavonoids + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Flavonoids are a very large family of polyphenolic compounds synthesised by plants that are common and widely distributed.Flavonoids + Irinotecan or Topotecan Limited evidence suggests that high doses of chrysin are unlikelyto cause an adverse interaction with irinotecan and possiblytopotecan. Clinical evidence In a pilot study in patients with colorectal cancer receiving intravenous irinotecan 350 mg/m 2every 3 weeks, chrysin 250 mg twice daily for one week before, and one week after, irinotecan appeared to be associated with a low incidence of irinotecan-induced diarrhoea. There was no difference in the pharmacokinetics ofirinotecan and its metabolites when compared with historical data foririnotecan. Survival data did not differ from historical datasuggesting that chrysin did not reduce the efficacy of irinotecan.1 However, note that this study was small and did not include a controlgroup: therefore its findings require confirmation in a larger randomised study. Experimental evidence In vitro , chrysin has been found to be a potent inhibitor of the human transporter protein, BCRP. However, in a study in ratsandmice, oral chrysin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of the BCRP substrate, topotecan. It was suggested that this may have been due to differences in ratandmouse BCRP compared with human BCRP.2 Mechanism The flavonoid chrysin possibly acts as an inducer of the metabolism of irinotecan by glucuronidases. It may also be an inhibitor of humanBCRP. Importance and management The available data suggest that high doses of chrysin are unlikely to cause an adverse interaction if given with irinotecan, and might possibly be beneficial, but more study is needed to establish this. It istoo early to say whether chrysin might affect topotecan pharmaco-kinetics, but the study does highlight a problem with extrapolatinganimal data to humans when studying this potential interaction. 1.

Drug Metab Dispos (2005) 33, between morin, naringin or quercetin and paclitaxel is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence (a) Morin The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel were determined in ratsafter oral or intravenous administration of paclitaxel with or without morin (3.3 and 10 mg/kg).1Compared with paclitaxel alone, morin, given 30 minutes before oral paclitaxel, increased the maximum levels andAUC of paclitaxel by 70 to 90% and 30 to 70%, respectively,without any change in the time to reach maximum levels, orelimination half-life. In contrast, the pharmacokinetics of intraven-ous paclitaxel (3.3 mg/kg) were not altered significantly by morin. (b) Naringin A study to investigate the effects of oral naringin on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous paclitaxel in rats found that oral192 Flavonoids Fnaringin (3.3 and 10 mg/kg), when given to rats 30 minutes before intravenous administration of paclitaxel (3 mg/kg), produced asignificantly paclitaxel (about 41% and 49% for naringin doses of 3.3 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). Clearance was also delayed (29% and 33% decrease, respectively) when comparedwith the controls. 2In a similar study using oral paclitaxel, oral naringin increased the AUC of paclitaxel by up to threefold, andincreased the elimination half-life. The oral bioavailability ofpaclitaxel increased from 2.2% up to 6.8%. 3 (c) Quercetin In an animal study using oral paclitaxel, oral quercetin increased the AUC of paclitaxel by up to 3.3-fold, and increased the elimination half-life. The oral bioavailability of paclitaxel increased from 2% upto 6.6%. 4 Mechanism of paclitaxel CYP3A andthe transport of paclitaxel via intestinal P-glycoprotein, therebyincreasing the AUC of paclitaxel. Note that there is evidence thatquercetin does not inhibit CYP2C8, because it did not alter themetabolism of rosiglitazone, below, a specific substrate forCYP2C8. Importance and management The finding of increased oral absorption of paclitaxel with morin, naringin and quercetin is of little clinical relevance because paclitaxel is not used orally (it is poorly absorbed, even in thepresence of the flavonoids). Morin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous paclitaxel, but the 50% increase in the AUC of intravenouspaclitaxel caused by naringin would be clinically relevant in humans. However, these are animal data, and therefore some caution is required in extrapolating their findings. Further study is needed before any specific recommendations can be made. 1.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Inrats, naringin 25 mg/kg daily for 7 days increased the oral bioavailability of a single 25-mg/kg oral dose of quinine from 17% to 42%, but did not affect the pharmacokinetics of intravenousquinine. 1In an in vitro study, quercetin andnaringenin were modest inhibitors of quinine metabolism.2 In another in vitro study, quercetin was an inhibitor of quinidine metabolism, with kaempferol andnaringenin also having an effect,3 and, in rats, quinidine approximately halved the AUC of baicalin in blood, and increased its levels in bile by 47%.4 Mechanism Flavonoids are predicted to interact with quinine and quinidine via effects on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes or P-glycoprotein.Importance and management On the basis of animal andin vitro data, it is possible that high doses of quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin or naringin might increase quinine or quinidine levels, but any interaction is not firmlyestablished. Furthermore, the rise in the quinine levels was modest, and unlikely to be clinically relevant if a similar effect were shown in practice. Note that grapefruit juice (a rich source of flavonoids),does not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics ofquinine or quinidine. The clinical relevance of the effects ofquinidine on biacalin disposition is unclear. 1. Zhang H, Wong CW, Coville PF, Wanwimolruk S.

Flavonoids + Rosiglitazone Quercetin does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone. Clinical evidence In a crossover study in 10 healthy subjects, quercetin 500 mg daily for 3 weeks had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4-mg dose of rosiglitazone, or its principal metabolite N-desmethylrosi- glitazone.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Rosiglitazone is a specific substrate for the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C8, and it therefore appears that multiple-dosequercetin has no clinically relevant effect on this isoenzyme.Therationale that it might was because, in vitro , quercetin inhibits the CYP2C8-mediated metabolism of a number of substrates includingpaclitaxel, page 192. However, in the paclitaxel (andpossibly the other substrates), P-glycoprotein inhibition andCYP3A4 might also be important. Importance and management Although evidence appears to be limited to this one study, it is supported by in vitro data that suggest the absence of an interaction. No clinically important pharmacokinetic interaction would be expected with long-term use of quercetin supplements in patientstaking rosiglitazone, and therefore no dosage adjustments would beexpected to be needed. 1. Kim K-A, Park P-W, Kim H-K, Ha J-M, Park J-Y. quercetin on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 substrate, in healthy subjects. J Pharmacol (2005) 45, 941 -6. Flavonoids + Saquinavir Quercetin does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics ofsaquinavir. Clinical evidence In a study in 10 healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir 1.2 g three times daily ( Fortovase ; soft capsules) were not affected by the concurrent use of quercetin 500 mg three times daily for 8 days. Concurrent use of both products was well tolerated.1Flavonoids 193 FExperimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Based on other data for quercetin, it was suggested that this flavonoid might increase saquinavir levels by inhibiting P-glycoprotein, or by effects on the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP3A4. Importance and management Although the study appears to be the only published data, the absence of an interaction is fairly well established. Quercetin is unlikely to have a detrimental (or beneficial) pharmacokinetic effect when used with saquinavir, and therefore no dosage adjustmentswould be expected to be necessary on concurrent use. 1.

Pharmacotherapy (2006) 26, 1255- 61. Flavonoids + Statins The interaction between flavonoids and statins is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Inrats, oral kaempferol and naringenin , given with lovastatin, markedly increased the AUC of lovastatin acid. Increases were 2.7-fold and 3.5-fold with kaempferol 2 mg/kg and 10 and with naringenin 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively.1Other in vitro studies have shown that naringenin inhibits simvastatin metabolism.2,3 Mechanism Kaempferol and naringenin may be naringenin may inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4,the metabolism of lovastatin. Esteraseshydrolyse lovastatin in the gut to lovastatin which is poorly absorbed: esterase inhibition by these flavonoids may be expected to increase the stability of lovastatin, increasing its absorption. 1 Subsequent metabolism then leads to greater levels of lovastatinacid than would have occurred in the absence of the flavonoids. Importance and management There appears to be no clinical evidence to support these experi- mental findings of an interaction between kaempferol or naringenin and simvastatin or lovastatin. However, the marked increase in lovastatin levels that occurred with these flavonoids in the animal study, and the known important interaction of grapefruit juice (whichis a rich source of flavonoids) with lovastatin and simvastatin(leading to rhabdomyolysis and myopathy), suggest that kaempferoland naringenin supplements should generally be avoided in patientstaking these statins. This advice should be extended to citrusbioflavonoid supplements. 1. Li P, Callery PS, Gan L-S, Balani SK. Esterase inhibition by grapefruit juice flavonoids leading to a new drug interaction.

Experimental evidence (a) Antagonistic effects Various flavonoids have been investigated in vitro for their ability to reduce the proliferation of cancer cells, and in vivo some studies have shown synergistic cytotoxicity with tamoxifen (e.g. with catechins1). In contrast, and of concern, it has been reported that tangeretin abolished the growth inhibitory effects of tamoxifen in mice, and shortened the survival time of tamoxifen-treated tumour-bearing mice compared with those receiving tamoxifen alone.2This finding was not explained by changes in tamoxifen pharmacokinetics, seebelow. (b) Pharmacokinetics In a study, mice receiving tangeretin and tamoxifen had higher tamoxifen levels than those receiving tamoxifen alone. In addition, tangeretin did not alter the ratio between tamoxifen and its N-desmethyl metabolite.2 In a study in rats,3oralquercetin modestly increased the AUC of oral tamoxifen given concurrently. The effect was not dose dependent; there was a 35% increase with quercetin 2.5 mg/kg, a 60% increase with quercetin 7.5 mg/kg and a smaller 20% increase with quercetin 15 mg/kg. There was also a minor 8 to 29% increase in the AUC of the with tamoxifen by 60%(from 15% to 24%). Mechanism These findings suggest that quercetin inhibits both drug transporter proteins and possibly the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, which decreases the first-pass metabolism of tamoxifen. 3The authors suggested that the antagonistic effect of tangeretin againsttamoxifen was because tangeretin is an inhibitor of natural killer cellactivity. 2 Importance and management There do not appear to be any clinical data investigating the possible interactions between tamoxifen and flavonoids, and extrapolating the available animal findings to the clinical situation is difficult. Nevertheless, some caution is required if patients taking tamoxifenalso take products containing tangeretin, because the effect oftamoxifen was abolished in one study, despite an increase in itslevels. Studies are clearly needed that assess both efficacy andpharmacokinetic effects of the concurrent use of tangeretin and tamoxifen. The authors of the study with tangeretin suggested that the level of tangeretin used (human equivalent of about 280 mgdaily) could not be obtained by eating citrus fruits or drinking juices.However, they advise caution with the use of products containinglarge amounts of citrus peel oil, and dietary supplements containinglarge amounts of citrus bioflavonoids as these could providesufficient amounts of tangeretin to interact. Given the severity ofthe possible outcome, until more is known this seems prudent. 1. Rosengren RJ. Catechins and the treatment of breast cancer: possible utility and mechanistic targets.

Constituents The seeds contain a fixed oil, composed of glycerides of linoleic and linolenic acid . The linamarin and lotaustralin. Use and indications Flaxseed was formerly used as a demulcent and soothing emollient agent for bronchitis and coughs, and appliedexternally to burns. More recently, flaxseed oil has been used to lower blood-cholesterol levels, and flaxseed extract is being taken as a form of hormone replacement therapy dueto its phytoestrogenic effects, thought to be due to thelignans (although note that the information available onphytoestrogenic lignans is limited). Pharmacokinetics Ingested lignans such as secoisolariciresinol have been shown to undergo bacterial hydrolysis and metabolism to produce the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enter- odiol, which have oestrogenic effects. Flaxseed lignan supplementation appears to have no signifi-cant effect on blood-glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patientsalso taking oral antidiabetic drugs (not named). Limited evidence suggests that flaxseed oil may increase bleeding times and therefore some caution might therefore beappropriate with aspirin and anticoagulants. F 195Flaxseed + Anticoagulant or Antiplatelet drugs Limited evidence suggests that flaxseed oil may have some antiplatelet effects, which could be additive with those of conventional antiplatelet drugs, and increase the risk of bleedingwith anticoagulants. Clinical evidence Two case reports briefly describe increased bleeding (haematuria and nosebleeds) in patients taking aspirin and flaxseed oil, one of whomwas taking low-dose aspirin. 1 Some studies have investigated the effect of flaxseed oil alone on bleeding time, and one, in 10 healthy subjects, found that a flaxseedoil rich diet (20.5 g daily of -linolenic acid) for 56 days had no significant effect on bleeding times, prothrombin times or partialprothrombin times. 2However, another study in 11 patients with rheumatoid arthritis reported that flaxseed oil 30 g daily for 3 months(9.6 g daily of -linolenic acid) increased the bleeding time by about one minute when compared with baseline, although this result wasnot statistically significant. 3 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Omega-3 fatty acids such as linolenic acid are thought to have some antiplatelet effects and might therefore prolong bleeding time. Theoretically, this effect might be additive to that of otherantiplatelet drugs, and increase the risk of bleeding with antic-oagulants. Importance and management The general significance of these reports is unclear and no interaction has been established. Nevertheless, a large epidemi- ological study would be needed to quantify any excess risk in the order of that seen with antiplatelet doses of aspirin taken withwarfarin. As with high doses of fish oils (marine omega-3 fattyacids), it may be prudent to use some caution with the concurrent useof high doses of flaxseed supplements in patients also taking aspirinor anticoagulants. 1.

Dietary -linolenic acid alters tissue fatty acid composition but not blood lipids, lipoproteins or coagulation status in humans. Lipids controlled and randomized Antidiabetics Flaxseed lignan supplementation appears to have no significant effect on blood-glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients alsotaking oral antidiabetic drugs.Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study in 68 patients with type 2 diabetes and mild hypercholesterolaemia, taking a supplement containing atotal of 360 mg of flaxseed lignan daily for 12 weeks had no significant effect on blood-lipid profile, insulin resistance, fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. A minor reduction of glycosy- lated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) of about 0.1% occurred, although the clinical significance of this reduction is likely to be minimal. In thisparticular study, patients continued to take their usual medication,which included oral antidiabetics and lipid-lowering medications,none of which was specifically named in the study. Patients wereexcluded from the study if they were using insulin. 1Similarly, in another study, flaxseed oil (60 mg/kg -linolenic acid daily) had no significant effect on blood-glucose control in type 2 diabetics.Patients taking insulin were also excluded from this study; however,information on other concurrent medication was not reported. 2In another study in 25 menopausal women with hypercholesterolaemia,there was a slight 5.3% reduction in blood-glucose levels(0.1 mmol/L) with crushed flaxseed , and this was less than that seen with conventional HRT,3which is not considered to have blood-glucose-lowering effects. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism No mechanism expected. Importance and management It appears from these studies that flaxseed oil or lignans have minimal effects on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes, and in onestudy the lignans had no additive blood-glucose-lowering effectswith oral antidiabetic (not named). Flaxseed is thereforeunlikely to affect the blood-glucose-lowering efficacy of concurrentantidiabetic medication. However, more detailed information on specific antidiabetic drugs is unavailable. 1.

The frangulosides are the main components, which include frangulin A and B, emodin derivatives, chrysophanol and physcion free contains flavonoids and tannins.Use and indications Frangula bark is used as a laxative. Pharmacokinetics For information on the pharmacokinetics of an anthraqui- none glycoside present in frangula, see under aloes, page 27. Interactions overview No interactions with frangula found; however, frangula (by virtue of its anthraquinone content) is expected to share some of the interactions of a number of other anthraquinone-containing laxatives, such as aloes, page 27 and senna,page 349. Of particular relevance are the interactions with 32); Garlic Fluid Extract ( USP 32 ); Garlic for Homeopathic Preparations (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Garlic Powder ( Ph Eur 6.4,BP 2009 ); Powdered Garlic ( USP 32 ); Powdered Garlic Extract ( USP 32 ). Constituents Garlic products are produced from the bulbs (cloves) of garlic and are usually standardised according to the content of the sulphur-containing compounds, alliin, allicin (pro- duced by contains various glycosides, monoterpenoids, enzymes, vitamins, minerals and flavonoids based on kaempferol and quercetin. Use and indications Garlic has been used to treat respiratory infections (such as colds, flu, chronic bronchitis, and nasal and throat catarrh)and cardiovascular disorders. It antimicrobial, anticancer, expectorant, antidiabetic and lipid-loweringproperties. It also used extensively as an ingredient in foods. Pharmacokinetics There are many active constituents in garlic and their roleshave not been fully elucidated. Allicin is subject to a considerable first-pass effect and passes through the liver unmetabolised only at high concentrations, 1but it is a very unstable compound and, as with ajoene, the vinyldithiins and diallylsulfide, it is not found in blood or urine after oral ingestion.2 There have been several experimental studies undertaken to assess the effects garlic and its constituents have on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. In vitro studies suggest that garlic CYP2C9,3,4CYP2C19,3,4 the CYP3A induces CYP2C9*2.3However, inclinical studies, garlic and its constituents seem unlikely to affect the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes to a clinically relevant extent, see benzodiazepines, page 199, for CYP3A4, caffeine, page 200, for CYP1A2, and dextro-methorphan, page 200, for CYP2D6. The possible exception to the lack of effect of garlic on cytochrome P450 is CYP2E1, which requires further study, see chlorzoxazone,page 200, and paracetamol (acetaminophen), page 202. Any effect on the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, shown in vitro , 3is also unlikely to be clinically significant, see protease inhibitors, page 202. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in garlic, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Case reports suggest that garlic may have additive bloodpressure-lowering effects with lisinopril, and may cause bleeding in those taking warfarin or fluindione. It has also been suggested that any antiplatelet effects of garlic may beadditive with conventional antiplatelet drugs and NSAIDs, and studies suggest that garlic may reduce isoniazid levels. However, no interaction has been proven with any of thesedrugs. In general, garlic seems to have no effect, or have only clinically irrelevant effects when it is given with alcohol,benzodiazepines (such interaction between garlic and fish oils may be beneficial. One study suggested that a high-fat diet did not affect the absorption of some of the active constituents of garlic oil.For information on the interactions of individual flavonoids present in garlic, see under flavonoids, page 186. 1.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A man whose blood pressure was 135/90 mmHg while taking lisinopril 15 mg daily began to take garlic 4 mg daily ( Boots odourless garlic oil capsules ). After 3 days he became faint on standing and was found to have a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. Stopping the garlic restored his blood pressure to 135/90 mmHg within a week. The garlic on its own did not lower his bloodpressure. The reasons for this interaction are not known, althoughgarlic has been reported to cause vasodilation and blood pressurereduction. 1This seems to be the first and only report of this reaction, so its general importance is small. There seems to be nothingdocumented about garlic and any of the other ACE inhibitors. 1. McCoubrie M. Doctors as patients: lisinopril and garlic. Br J Gen Pract (1996) 46, 107. Garlic + Alcohol The interaction between garlic and alcohol is based on experi-mental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Garlic juice, from fresh garlic bulbs, inhibited the metabolism of alcohol in mice. Garlic is a common ingredient in food and so it is very unlikely that this interaction is clinically relevant. 1 1. Kishimoto R, Ueda M, Yoshinaga H, Goda K, Park S-S. Combined effects of ethanol and garlic on hepatic ethanol metabolism in mice. J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (1999) 45, 275 - 86. Garlic + Antiplatelet drugs Garlic may have antiplatelet properties. It might therefore be expected to increase the risk of bleeding with conventionalantiplatelet drugs and other drugs that have antiplatelet adverseeffects. Clinical evidence In a study in 23 healthy subjects, liquid aged garlic extract 5 mL (Kyolic ), given daily for 13 weeks, inhibited both the rate of platelet aggregation and total platelet aggregation. 1Similar effects were found in another study in 28 healthy subjects given aged garlicextract capsules 2.4 g, 4.8 g and 7.2 g. Each dose was given daily fora 6-week period. 2 Experimental evidence Ajoene, a sulphur compound derived from garlic with antiplatelet and antithrombotic properties, was found to synergistically potenti-ate the antiplatelet actions of dipyridamole ,epoprostenol and indometacin in vitro .3 Mechanism Uncertain. The authors of an experimental study3suggest that ajoene inhibits the binding of fibrinogen to the fibrinogen receptor, which occurs in the final step of the platelet aggregation pathway. Ajoenewould therefore be expected to interact synergistically withantiplatelet drugs that act at an earlier step in the pathway. Importance and management There is a reasonable body of evidence, which suggests that aged garlic herbal products may have antiplatelet properties. If they do,and they are similarly active to low-dose aspirin, they mighttherefore be expected to increase the risk of bleeding withconventional antiplatelet drugs and other drugs that have antiplatelet adverse effects, such as indometacin. However, considering the widespread use of garlic and garlic products, and the limitedinformation available, it seems unlikely that garlic has any generallyimportant interaction with antiplatelet drugs. Nevertheless, bear thepossibility in mind in the event of an unexpected response totreatment. 1. Rahman K, Billington D.

Garlic + Benzodiazepines Garlic does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam, midazolam or triazolam to a clinically relevant extent. Clinical evidence A study in 14 healthy subjects found that Kwai garlic tablets 600 mg twice daily for 14 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of a single 2-mg dose of alprazolam .1 Similarly, garlic oil 500 mg three times daily for 28 days did not affect the metabolism of midazolam 8 mg in young2or elderly3 healthy subjects. Experimental evidence the CYP3A probe substrate, triazolam , was investigated using human liver microsomes. Both S-methyl-L-cysteine and S- allyl-L-cysteine inhibited the activity of CYP3A, with the latterreducing its activity by about 60%. No other significant inhibitionwas apparent. 4 Mechanism The findings of the clinical studies suggest that garlic does not have a clinically relevant effect on CYP3A4 activity. Although some inhibition of CYP3A was seen in the in vitro study,4it was not considered to be mechanism based and the concentrations used werean order of magnitude greater than the anticipated in vivo concentrations. Importance and management The results of the clinical studies suggest that garlic does not affect the metabolism of alprazolam or midazolam, and therefore no dosage adjustments would be expected to be necessary if patientstaking these benzodiazepines also take garlic supplements. Midazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between garlic and other JS, sativum L.) supplementation on (2003) 74, 170 -7. 2.

Clinical evidence Garlic oil 500 mg three times daily for 28 days did not affect the metabolism of a single 100-mg dose of caffeine in young1or elderly2 healthy subjects. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Garlic does not have a clinically relevant effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 activity using caffeine as a probesubstrate. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between garlic and caffeine appears to come from two well-designed studies in humans. These studiessuggest that garlic does not affect the metabolism of caffeine, andtherefore an increase in caffeine adverse effects would not beexpected in those who also take garlic supplements. Caffeine is usedas a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic interaction between garlic and other CYP1A2 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Garlic + Chlorzoxazone The metabolism of chlorzoxazone is modestly inhibited by garlic but this effect is probably not clinically relevant. Clinical evidence Garlic oil 500 mg, given to 12 healthy subjects three times daily for 28 days, reduced the conversion of a single 500-mg dose of chlorzoxazone to 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone by about 40%.1In a later similar study by the same authors, in 12 elderly healthy subjects, a smaller reduction of 22% was seen.2 Another study in 8 healthy subjects found that a high dose of the garlic constituent diallyl sulfide 200 micrograms/kg (equivalent to 15 cloves of fresh garlic, containing 1 mg/g diallyl sulfide), reducedthe conversion of chlorzoxazone to 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone by 30%. 3 Experimental evidence A garlic constituent, diallyl sulfide 50 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, was given to rats12 hours before an intravenous dose of chlorzoxazone sulfide increased by threefold and fivefold, respectively.4 MechanismGarlic appears to inhibit the activity isoenzyme CYP2E1, which metabolises chlorzoxazone to6-hydroxychlorzoxazone. Importance and management There appear to be several clinical studies into the potential for an interaction between garlic and chlorzoxazone. Although these studies suggest that metabolism of chlorzoxazone is modestlyinhibited by garlic in healthy subjects, this effect is probably notclinically relevant. Chlorzoxazone is used as a probe drug for CYP1E2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between garlic and other CYP1E2 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Garlic + Dextromethorphan Garlic does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan or debrisoquine. Clinical evidence A study in 14 healthy subjects found that Kwai garlic tablets 600 mg twice daily for 14 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan.1 Garlic oil 500 mg three times daily for 28 days did not affect the metabolism of debrisoquine 5 mg in young2or elderly3healthy subjects. Experimental evidence The of the CYP2D6 probe substrate, dextromethorphan, was investigated using human liver microsomes. No significantinhibition was apparent. 4 Mechanism Garlic does not appear to affect the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6. Importance and management There appear to be two clinical studies investigating the potential for an interaction between garlic and dextromethorphan, both of whichfound that the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan wereunaffected by garlic and its constituents. Therefore the dosage of dextromethorphan would not need adjusting if patients also wish to take garlic supplements. Dextromethorphan and debrisoquine are used as probe drugs for CYP2D6 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that apharmacokinetic interaction between garlic and other CYP2D6substrates is unlikely. 1.

Clinical evidence In a pharmacokinetic study, 10 patients with metastatic, or incurable localised, breast cancer were given 1-hour intravenous infusions ofdocetaxel 30 mg/m2weekly for 3 weeks (days 1, 8 and 15). Five days after the first infusion, garlic tablets 600 mg were taken twice daily for 13 days (days 5 to 17). The garlic tablets used were GarliPure Maximum Allicin Formula ,Natrol , containing 3.6 mg of allicin per tablet. Patients were also given a premedication regimenof oral dexamethasone 8 mg 12 hours before each docetaxel infusionand then every 12 hours for two more doses, and ondansetron 8 mg,ranitidine 150 mg and diphenhydramine 25 mg half an hour beforeeach infusion of docetaxel. Garlic tablets had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel on the second or third week, when compared with the first week (i.e. after 4 and 12 days' use of garlic). 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Docetaxel is metabolised, in part, by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. This study suggests that garlic is unlikely to alter the activity of this isoenzyme. See also benzodiazepines,page 199. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study, but it is supported by the findings of other studies that suggest that garlic does not alterthe effects of CYP3A4, the main route of docetaxel metabolism. Therefore what is known suggests that no pharmacokinetic interaction would be expected in patients taking garlic supplementswith intravenous docetaxel. 1.

Garlic + Food The information regarding the use of garlic with food is based onexperimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in ratsthat were fed a high-fat or low-fat diet, and also given garlic oil or its constituents diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide, there were no biochemical changes between the groups attributableto an interaction between the garlic oil and dietary fat. 1No clinical interaction is expected; note that garlic is extensively used as a foodingredient. For the lack of pharmacokinetic interaction of garlic with caffeine, see caffeine, page 200. 1. Sheen L-Y, Chen H-W, Kung Y-L, Cheng-Tzu L, Lii C-K.

Garlic + Gentamicin The information regarding the use of garlic with gentamicin is based on experimental evidence only.Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Aged garlic extract or garlic powder extract did not affect the in vitro antibacterial activity of gentamicin 2.6 micrograms/L and 2.7 micrograms/L on Escherichia coli . The bactericidal effect of gentamicin against E. coli , measured by optical density, was increased by S-allylcysteine, diallyl sulfide, and diallyl disulfide, at concentrations 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL but thesignificance of this is unclear. However, no clinically significantinteraction is expected as far as antibacterial activity is concerned. 1 1. Maldonado PD, Ch\u00e1nez-C\u00e1rdenas ME, Pedraza-Chaverr\u00ed J.

Garlic + Herbal medicines; Caffeine- containing Garlic did not interact with caffeine, page 200, and is therefore unlikely to interact with caffeine-containing herbs, as a result of this constituent. Garlic + Herbal medicines; Fish oil Garlic supplements and fish oils may have beneficial effects on blood lipids. Clinical evidence In a placebo-controlled study in 46 subjects with moderate, untreated hypercholesterolaemia, combined use of garlic pills 300 mg threetimes daily ( Kwai ) and fish oil capsules 4 g three times daily for 12 weeks was compared with either garlic or fish oil alone. Garlicmodestly reduced total cholesterol, and fish oil did not alter this effect. Fish oil reduced triacylglycerol levels, and garlic did not alter this effect. Garlic alone reduced low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol,and combined use with fish oil reversed the increase of low-density- lipoprotein cholesterol seen with fish oil alone and produced areduction similar to that seen with garlic alone. Slight reductions inblood pressure were also reported with all treatments. 1The fish oil used was 1-g capsules ( Nupulse ) each containing eicosapentaenoic acid 180 mg and docosahexaenoic acid 120 mg. Experimental evidence Garlic oil has been found to enhance the antioxidant effects of fish oils in rats.2 Mechanism Unclear. In the experimental study, garlic oil synergistically increased the induction of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase by fish oils, and the combination additively increased the protein levelsof CYP1A1, CYP2E1 and CYP3A1. Importance and management The available clinical evidence appears to come from one study, which suggests that the combined use of garlic supplements and fishoils may have beneficial effects on blood lipids, which are known to be risk factors in coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis. While the clinical importance is inconclusive, any interaction is notexpected to be harmful as far as blood lipids are concerned. Furtherstudy is needed to establish the benefits of combined use. 1.

Experimental evidence In a study in rabbits , a garlic extract, produced from blended garlic cloves (exact dosage unknown) and given orally over 14 days, reduced the AUC and maximum serum levels of a single 30-mg/kgdose of isoniazid by about 55% and 65%, respectively, whencompared with the levels attained after a single 30-mg/kg dose ofisoniazid given 7 days before the garlic extract. 1 Mechanism Unclear. It was anticipated that garlic might increase isoniazid levels by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1, butdecreased levels were seen. While the authors speculate that garlic extract may induce enzymes in the intestinal mucosa, whichinterferes with the absorption of isoniazid, they suggest that thefindings cannot be explained solely on this basis. Importance and management The evidence is limited to this one study, and because the mechanism is unknown, a crude garlic extract was used, and thedata are from rabbits , it is difficult to apply these findings to a clinical setting. However, if the reduction was shown to be replicatedin humans then isoniazid efficacy might be reduced, so further studyis warranted. Until more is known, a conservative approach wouldbe to suggest some caution with the use of garlic supplements inpatients taking isoniazid. 1. Dhamija P, Malhotra S, Pandhi P. Effect of oral administration of crude aqueous extract of garlic on pharmacokinetic parameters of isoniazid and rifampicin in rabbits. Pharmacology (2006) 77, 100 -4. Garlic + Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) Studies in healthy subjects found that garlic did not affect the pharmacokinetics of single-dose paracetamol to a clinicallyrelevant extent. Clinical evidence A study in 16 healthy subjects found that the use of an aged garlic extract (approximately equivalent to 6 to 7 cloves of garlic daily) for3 months had little effect on the metabolism of a single 1-g oral doseof paracetamol. 1 Experimental evidence Diallyl sulfide, a constituent of garlic, and, to a greater extent, its metabolite diallyl sulfone, protected mice from paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity when given immediately after a toxic dose ofparacetamol (200 mg/kg). The effect of diallyl sulfone 25 mg/kgwas equivalent to that of the known antidote, acetylcysteine. 2 Mechanism There was a very slight increase in glucuronidation of a therapeutic dose of paracetamol after the long-term use of garlic in the clinical study, and some evidence that sulfate conjugation was enhanced, butno effect on oxidative metabolism. It was suggested that diallyl sulfone protected against the hepatotoxicity of paracetamol after a toxic dose in mice because it irreversibly inhibited the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1.This isoenzyme is thought to be responsible for the production of a minor but highly reactive paracetamol metabolite, N-acetyl- p- benzoquinoneimine (NABQI).Importance and management The evidence regarding an interaction between paracetamol and garlic is limited, but what is known suggests that no clinicallysignificant interaction would be expected if paracetamol is takenwith garlic. The animal data suggest that it is possible that some garlic constituents, or substances derived from them, might prove toprotect against the hepatotoxicity from higher than therapeutic dosesof paracetamol, but this requires further study. 1.

Garlic + Protease inhibitors A garlic supplement reduced the plasma levels of saquinavir inone study, but had little effect in another. Another garlicsupplement did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of ritonavir. Clinical evidence In a study in 9 healthy subjects garlic reduced the AUC and maximum and minimum plasma levels of saquinavir by about 50%. The garlic was taken in the form of a dietary supplement (GarliPure , Maximum Allicin Formula caplets) twice daily for 20 days. Saquinavir 1.2 g three times daily was given for 4-day periods before, during and after the garlic supplement. Fourteen days afterthe garlic supplement was stopped the saquinavir pharmacokinetics had still not returned to baseline values. Of the 9 subjects, 6 had asubstantial drop in the AUC of saquinavir while taking garlic, then a rise when garlic was stopped. The remaining 3 had no change in theAUC of saquinavir while taking garlic, but had a drop when garlic was stopped.1However, in another study, garlic extract ( Garlipure ) 1.2 g daily for 3 weeks had no significant effect on the pharmaco- kinetics of a single 1.2-g dose of saquinavir (a slight decrease in AUC in 7 subjects and a slight increase in 3).2 In a study in 10 healthy subjects the use of a garlic extract (10 mg, equivalent to 1 g of fresh garlic) twice daily for 4 days did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg dose of ritonavir . There was a non-significant 17% decrease in the AUC of ritonavir . The garlic was given in the form of capsules ( Natural Source Odourless Garlic Life Brand ).3Gastrointestinal toxicity was noted in 2 patients taking garlic or garlic supplements when theystarted to take ritonavir -containing regimens.4 Experimental evidence In an experimental study using cell lines, allicin, a major active constituent of garlic, significantly decreased the clearance (efflux) of ritonavir from the cells in a dose-dependent manner.5 Mechanism The mechanism of this interaction is uncertain, but it is thought that garlic reduced the bioavailability of saquinavir by increasing itsmetabolism in the intestine. 1Why there was a disparity in the effect of garlic on saquinavir between patients is unclear. Allicin is thought to have inhibited the activity of P-glycoprotein in vitro , which caused the build-up of ritonavir within the cell.5 Importance and management Although information is limited, a reduction in saquinavir plasma levels of the magnitude seen in the first study could diminish itsantiviral efficacy. All garlic supplements should probably be avoidedin those taking saquinavir as the sole protease inhibitor, but note thatthis is no longer generally recommended. The effect of garlic on saquinavir levels in the presence of ritonavir (as a pharmacokinetic enhancer) does not appear to have been studied. The pharmaco-202 Garlic Gkinetic effect on single-dose ritonavir was not clinically important, but this requires confirmation in a multiple-dose study. 1.

Garlic + Rifampicin (Rifampin) The information regarding the use of garlic with rifampicin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rabbits , a garlic extract, produced from blended garlic cloves (exact dosage unknown) and given orally over 14 days, did not alter the AUC and maximum serum levels of a single 24-mg/kgdose of rifampicin, when compared with the levels attained after asingle 24-mg/kg dose of rifampicin given 7 days before the garlicextract. 1 Mechanism No mechanism expected. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study in animals . Nevertheless, what is known suggests that no changes in the dose of rifampicin are likely to be needed if it is also taken with garlic. 1. Dhamija P, Malhotra S, Pandhi P.

Garlic + Warfarin and related drugs An isolated report described increases in the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in two patients taking garlic supplements. Another report described a decrease in anticoagulant effects of fluindione in a patient taking garlic tablets. Garlic supplementsalone have also rarely been associated with bleeding. However,in one study, aged garlic extract did not increase the INR or riskof bleeding in patients taking warfarin. Clinical evidence (a) Fluindione In an 82-year-old man stabilised on fluindione 5 mg (dosage frequency not stated) for chronic atrial fibrillation, the INR droppedto below its usual range (2 to 3) when garlic tablets 600 mg dailywere taken, and remained below 2 for 12 consecutive days despitean increase in fluindione dosage to 10 mg. The INR returned tonormal, with an associated reduction in fluindione dose, when the garlic tablets were stopped. He was also taking enalapril 20 mg, furosemide 40 mg and pravastatin 20 mg (dosage frequency notstated). 1 (b) Warfarin The INR of a patient stabilised on warfarin more than doubled and haematuria occurred 8 weeks after the patient started to take threeH\u00f6fels garlic pearles daily. The situation resolved when the garlic was stopped. The INR rose on a later occasion while the patient was taking two Kwai garlic tablets daily. The INR of another patient was also more than doubled by six Kwai garlic tablets daily. 2,3 In contrast, in a placebo-controlled study in 48 patients stabilised on warfarin, there was no change in INR or evidence of increased bleeding in those receiving 5 mL of aged garlic extract ( Kyolic ) twice daily for 12 weeks.4Similarly, in a preliminary report of the use of alternative and complementary medicines in 156 patients taking warfarin, there was no apparent increased risk or bleeding or raised INRs in 57 patients taking potentially interacting comple-mentary medicines (garlic in 10%), compared with 84 who did not. 5 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Garlic has been associated with decreased platelet aggregation. See antiplatelet drugs, page 199 for possible mechanisms. This effect onplatelet aggregation has, on at least two documented occasions, led to spontaneous bleeding in the absence of an anticoagulant. 6,7These effects might therefore increase the risk of bleeding with antic- oagulants. However, this would not cause an increase in INR, andthe mechanism for this effect in the cases seen is unknown. Importance and management Information about an adverse interaction between coumarin antic- oagulants and garlic seems to be limited to these two reports, withwarfarin and fluindione. Bearing in mind the wide-spread use of garlic and garlic products, the limited information from the review 5 and the study with aged garlic extract,4it seems most unlikely that garlic usually has any generally important interaction with antic- oagulants. Nevertheless, bear the possibility in mind in the event ofan unexpected response to treatment. In addition, garlic may have some antiplatelet effects and, although there appear to be no clinical reports of an adverse interaction between garlic and antiplatelet drugs, it may be prudent to consider the potential for an increase in the severity of bleeding ifgarlic is given with anticoagulants.

Pharmacopoeias Ginger ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ,USP 32 ); Ginger Capsules (USP 32 ); Ginger Tincture ( USP 32 ); Powdered Ginger (USP 32). Constituents The constituents of ginger vary depending on whether fresh or dried forms are used. Generally, ginger rhizomes contain volatile oils of which and their derivatives, gingerdiols, gingerdiones and dihydrogingerdiones. Sho- gaols are formed from gingerols during drying, and together these make up the pungent principles of ginger. Ginger extracts have been standardised to contain a minimum of 15 mL/kg of essential oil with reference to thedried drug. Use and indications Ginger is thought to possess carminative, anti-emetic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic and antiplatelet properties. Both fresh and dried ginger are mainly used to settle the stomach, to alleviate the symptoms of motion sickness andto relieve morning sickness. Ginger has also been used in thetreatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and for migraines. Ginger is also an important culinary spice and the pungentproperties of ginger have also been exploited for use in cosmetics and soaps. Ginger is a constituent of Trikatu , a medicine used in Ayurvedic medicine in a ratio of 1:1:1 with Piper nigrum andPiper longum , see pepper, page 313. Pharmacokinetics Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of ginger inhumans is scarce but what has been found, in animals , is that gingerol, a major constituent of ginger, is rapidly clearedfrom plasma and elimination by the liver is involved. Gingerol is also a substrate of several UDP-glucuronosyl- transferases, which are major phase 2 metabolic enzymesresponsible for the metabolism of several drugs. Gut floraalso play a part in the metabolism of gingerol. 1 Interactions overview There are isolated cases of ginger increasing the response toanticoagulant treatment with warfarin and related drugs, buta controlled study did not confirm an interaction. A small study showed antiplatelet effects for ginger that were synergistic with those of nifedipine, but any effect needsconfirming. For the interactions of ginger as a constituent of Trikatu ,a medicine used in Ayurvedic medicine, see Pepper +Isoniazid, page 316, Pepper + NSAIDs, page 316, andPepper + Rifampicin (Rifampin), page 318.

Food Chem Toxicol (2008) 46, 409 -20.G 204Ginger + Anticoagulants Evidence from pharmacological studies suggests that ginger does not increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, nor does it altercoagulation or platelet aggregation on its own. However, twocase reports describe markedly raised INRs with phenprocou-mon and warfarin, which were associated with eating driedginger and drinking ginger tea. A prospective, longitudinalstudy also reports an increased risk of self-reported bleedingevents in patients taking warfarin and ginger. Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study in 12 healthy subjects, 3 ginger capsules taken three times daily for 2 weeks did not affect either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (INR) of a single 25-mg dose of warfarin taken on day 7. The brand of ginger used was Blackmores Travel Calm Ginger , each capsule containing an extract equivalent to 400 mg of ginger rhizome powder. Moreover, gingeralone did not affect the INR or platelet aggregation. 1 However, a case report describes a rise in INR to greater than 10, with epistaxis, in a woman stabilised on phenprocoumon several weeks after she started to eat ginger regularly in the form of pieces of dried ginger and tea from ginger powder. She was eventually restabilised on the original dose of phenprocoumon , and was advised to stop taking ginger.2Another very similar case has been described in a woman taking warfarin .3 Moreover, in a prospective, longitudinal study of patients taking warfarin and a herbal product or dietary supplement, there was a statistically significant increased risk of self-reported bleeding events in patients taking warfarin and ginger (7 bleeds in 25 weeks, none of which was major: odds ratio 3.2).4No elevated INRs were reported for the combination. Note that the number of patients taking ginger was not reported, except to say it was less than5% of 171 -so it was less than 8 patients. Also, the ginger products used were not mentioned and some patients were taking more thanone potentially interacting supplement. Experimental evidence See under Mechanism below. MechanismGinger ( Zingiber officinale ) has sometimes been listed as a herb that interacts with warfarin 5,6on the basis that in vitro it inhibits platelet aggregation. However, this antiplatelet effect has generally not been demonstrated in controlled clinical studies (three of which have beenreviewed 7) although in one other study ginger had antiplatelet effects that were synergistic with those of nifedipine,8see nifedipine, below. Importance and management Evidence from a controlled study suggests that ginger does not increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Despite it being cited as a herb that inhibits platelet aggregation, there is limited evidence thatit increases bleeding when given alone or with warfarin, and thereare just two case reports of markedly raised INRs with phenpro-coumon and warfarin, which were associated with ginger root andginger tea. Because of the many other factors influencing antic-oagulant control, it is not possible to reliably ascribe a change inINR specifically to a drug interaction in a single case report without other supporting evidence. It may be better to advise patients to discuss the use of any herbal products that they wish to try, and toincrease monitoring if this is thought advisable. Cases of uneventfuluse should be reported, as they are as useful as possible cases ofadverse effects. 1.

Ginger + Nifedipine A small study found that antiplatelet effects for ginger weresynergistic with those of nifedipine, but any effect needsconfirmation. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a small study in 10 hypertensive patients and another in 10 healthy subjects, ginger 1 g daily for 7 days given with nifedipine10 mg twice daily for 7 days inhibited platelet aggregation by up tothree times more than nifedipine alone. 1In these studies, ginger alone had similar antiplatelet effects to aspirin 75 mg (used as a control), either alone, or given with nifedipine. Nifedipine alone also had antiplatelet effects, but these were not as great as aspirin 75 mgGinger 205 Galone. The ginger used in this study was dried, but no other details about the preparation were given. Calcium-channel blockers are not generally viewed as antiplatelet drugs, and the finding of synergistic antiplatelet effects betweennifedipine and aspirin in this report and its clinical relevance needsfurther study. Furthermore, this study suggests that ginger alone mayhave similar antiplatelet effects to low-dose aspirin alone; however,this antiplatelet effect has generally not been demonstrated in othercontrolled clinical studies of ginger (three of which have beenreviewed 2). Therefore, it is difficult to make any clinical recom- mendations on the basis of this one small study. Further study is clearly needed. 1.

The leaves contain only minor amounts of ginkgolicacids, and some pharmacopoeias specify a limit for these. The seeds contain ginkgotoxin (4- O-methylpyridoxine) and ginkgolic acids. Use and indications The leaves of ginkgo are the part usually used. Ginkgo isoften used to improve cognitive function in cases ofdementia and memory loss, and it has been investigatedfor use in the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease. The ginkgolides are thought to possess antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory properties and it has been used for cerebro-vascular and peripheral vascular disorders, tinnitus, asthma and to relieve the symptoms of altitude sickness. Ginkgo seeds contain some toxic constituents; neverthe- less, they are used in China and Japan, including as a food. Pharmacokinetics The two main active components of ginkgo are flavonoids and terpene lactones. For information on the pharmacoki- netics of individual flavonoids present in ginkgo, see under flavonoids, page 186. In contrast to the flavonoids, thebioavailability of ginkgolide A and B (but not C) andbilobalide is relatively high and a large proportion of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. 1 The effects of ginkgo on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes appear to have been relatively well studied. It appears thatthe flavonoid fraction of ginkgo has more of an effect the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes than the terpene lactones, 2,3 and the effect on these enzymes can be halted relativelyquickly when ginkgo is stopped. 4In vitro andratstudies2-5have found that ginkgo may have some modest effects on CYP1A2 (see also theophyl- line, page 216). However, evidence from clinical studies using the specific probe substrate caffeine suggests that thisis not clinically relevant with therapeutic doses of ginkgo. See Ginkgo + Caffeine, page 211. Similarly, in vitro andratstudies 2-4,6-8have suggested that ginkgo affects CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP1E2, but clinical studies using the specific probe substrates tolbutamide, page 217, for CYP2C9, dextromethorphan, page 213, for CYP2D6, and chlorzoxazone, page 212, for CYP1E2 havefound no clinically relevant effect. In contrast, in vitro findings suggesting that ginkgo may affect CYP3A4 2-4,6-9and induce CYP2C92-4,6-8are supported by clinical studies with midazolam, page 210 and omepra-zole, page 216, respectively. However, the effect of ginkgoon CYP3A4 is unclear (induction and inhibition reported), but any effect appears modest at best. In vitro andratstudies 4,6,7also suggest that ginkgo may affect CYP2B6 and CYP2C8, but the clinical relevance ofthis needs investigation. Ginkgo is unlikely to affect the activity of P-glycoprotein to a clinically relevant extent (see digoxin, page 213). Interactions overview Ginkgo appears to decrease the levels of omeprazole; it seems likely that most other proton pump inhibitors will besimilarly affected. Some evidence suggests that diltiazemand nifedipine levels may be raised by ginkgo, whereas nicardipine levels may be reduced. Isolated cases of bleeding have been seen when ginkgo has been taken with conventional antiplatelet drugs, antic- oagulants and NSAIDs, and some cases have occurred with ginkgo alone, although a clinically relevant antiplatelet effect for ginkgo alone is not established. Isolated case reports alsosuggest that ginkgo may cause seizures in patients taking phenytoin and/or valproate and one case had decreased phenytoin and valproate levels. Phenobarbital levels do notappear to be significantly affected, although this is based onexperimental data only. Isolated cases also describe coma in a patient taking trazodone with ginkgo, priapism in a patient taking ginkgo with and CNS depression in apatient taking ginkgo with valerian, although this case isconfused by alcohol consumption. There are some animal data suggesting that ciclosporin levels might be reduced by ginkgo, and it has been suggestedthat the extrapyramidal adverse effects of haloperidol and the ototoxic effects of amikacin may be enhanced by ginkgo. Ginkgo does not appear to affect the a clinically relevant extent. For a case of anxiety and memory deficits in a woman taking several drugs and herbal medicines, including ginkgo,see St John' s wort + Buspirone, page 365.

Experimental evidence Ginkgo 100 mg/kg (EGb 761) daily for 20 days and amikacin 600 mg/kg daily for the first 14 days were given to rats. Amikacin- induced ototoxicity developed earlier and to a greater level than that caused by amikacin given alone. Ginkgo alone did not induceototoxicity. 1 Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Ginkgo appears to accelerate the appearance of amikacin-induced ototoxicity and to increase its ototoxic effects in rats. Because the development of ototoxicity is cumulative, if ginkgo accelerates thisprocess, there is potential for ototoxicity to develop at a lowercumulative dose. The available evidence is weak, but until more isknown it may be prudent to carefully consider the risks and benefits of continuing ginkgo during treatment with drugs such as the aminoglycosides. 1.

Ginkgo + Antiepileptics Case reports describe seizures in three patients taking valproate, or valproate and phenytoin, when ginkgo was also taken. Clinical evidence A 55-year-old man taking valproate andphenytoin for a seizure disorder that developed following coronary artery bypass surgery suffered a fatal breakthrough seizure while swimming a year later.Analysis of his medical history showed that he had unexplained subtherapeutic serum levels of valproate andphenytoin on three occasions over the previous year. It was later found that the patient had also been taking numerous vitamins, supplements and herbalmedicines without the knowledge of his physician, of which aginkgo extract was stated to be the most common ingredient. 1The only other herbal medicines named in the report were ginseng andsaw palmetto. In another case, a 78-year-old man, whose epileptic seizures had been well controlled by valproate 1.2 g daily for 7 years, suffered a cluster of seizures after taking a ginkgo extract 120 mg daily for2 weeks for the management of mild cognitive impairment. Theginkgo was stopped and the patient was reportedly seizure free8 months later. All other medications taken by the patient remainedunchanged. 2 An 84-year-old epileptic woman with severe dementia taking valproate 1.2 g daily had been seizure free for 2 years. After taking a ginkgo extract 120 mg daily for 12 days prescribed by her psych-iatrist, she suffered a cluster of seizures, which were treated withintravenous diazepam in the accident and emergency department.The ginkgo extract was stopped on admission and the patientremained free of seizures 4 months later. All other medications takenby the patient were unchanged. 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found.MechanismUnknown. Ginkgo seeds (nuts) contain the neurotoxin 4- O- methoxypyridoxine (ginkgotoxin), which indirectly inhibits the activity of glutamate decarboxylase, which in turn results in seizureinduction by lowering the levels of -aminobutyric acid (GABA). A large quantity of ginkgo nuts (about 70 to 80) alone have beenreported to be the cause of seizures in a healthy 36-year-old woman. 3 However, leaf extracts would not generally be expected to containsufficient levels of this neurotoxin to be a problem. Another possible mechanism is induction of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 by ginkgo. a substrate ofCYP2C19 and therefore, in theory, ginkgo may increase the metabolism of phenytoin and thereby reduce its levels. Ginkgo has been seen to induce CYP2C19 in clinical studies. See Ginkgo +Proton pump inhibitors, page 216. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between ginkgo and valproate and phenytoin appears to be limited to case reports. The only case thatmeasured serum levels of these antiepileptics is complicated by the use of numerous other supplements. An interaction is therefore by no means established. Nevertheless, it may be prudent to considerthe possibility of reduced effects if a patient taking phenytoin and/orvalproate wishes also to take ginkgo.

Ginkgo + Antiplatelet Ginkgo biloba has been associated with platelet, bleeding andclotting disorders, and there are isolated reports of serious adverse reactions after its concurrent use with antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine. Clinical evidence A study in 10 healthy subjects found no significant increase in the antiplatelet effects of single doses of clopidogrel 75 mg or cilostazol 100 mg when a single dose of ginkgo 120 mg was added. However, the bleeding time was significantly increased when cilostazol was combined with ginkgo, although none of the subjects developed any significant adverse effects.1Another study2in 8 healthy subjects found that ginkgo 40 mg three times daily had no significant effecton the pharmacokinetics of a single 250-mg dose of ticlopidine taken on day 4. A randomised, double-blind study in 55 patients with established peripheral artery disease (PAD), or with risk factors for developing PAD, found that the addition of ginkgo 300 mg (standardised extract EGb 761) in divided doses to aspirin 325 mg daily did not have a significant effect on platelet aggregation. Five of the patients takingcombined therapy reported nosebleeds or minor bleeding; however,4 patients from the aspirin -only group also reported minor bleeding.3 Similarly, a study in 41 healthy subjects found that 120-mg ginkgo-coated tablets (EGb 761) twice daily had no effect on the antiplateletactivity of aspirin 500 mg daily given for 7 days. Minor bleeding was seen in a few subjects but this was attributed to the use of aspirin .4In an analysis of supplement use, 23% of 123 patients were currently taking supplements, and 4 patients were found to be takingginkgo and aspirin . However, no problems from this use were found on review of the patients 'notes.5 Nevertheless, a number of cases of clinically significant bleeding have been reported. A 70-year-old man developed spontaneous bleeding from the iris into the anterior chamber of his eye within one week of starting to take a ginkgo supplement ( Ginkoba ) tabletGinkgo 209 Gtwice daily. He experienced recurrent episodes of blurred vision in one eye lasting about 15 minutes, during which he could see a reddiscoloration through his cornea. Each tablet contained 40 mg of concentrated (50:1) extract of ginkgo. He was also taking aspirin 325 mg daily, which he had taken uneventfully for 3 years since having coronary bypass surgery. He stopped taking the ginkgo butcontinued with the aspirin , and 3 months later had experienced no recurrence of the bleeding.6Another case reports persistent postoperative bleeding from a hip arthroplasty wound, whichcontinued despite stopping aspirin . On closer questioning, the patient had continued to take ginkgo extract 120 mg daily postoperatively. The oozing from the wound gradually reduced when the ginkgo was stopped. A search of Health Canada 's database of spontaneous adverse reactions for the period January 1999 to June 2003 found 21 reportsof suspected adverse reactions associated with ginkgo. Most of theseinvolved platelet, bleeding and clotting disorders. One report of afatal gastrointestinal haemorrhage was associated with ticlopidine and ginkgo, both taken over 2 years along with other medications. Another report was of a stroke in a patient taking multiple drugs,including clopidogrel ,aspirin and a herbal product containing ginkgo.7 Experimental evidence Ginkgo (EGb 761) 40 mg/kg daily had no effect on the antiplatelet activity of ticlopidine 50 mg/kg daily when given to ratsfor 3 days. However, when both were given for 5 days, the inhibition of plateletaggregation was double that of ticlopidine given alone and the bleeding time was increased by about 60%. Also, when given for 9 days, the combination was twice as effective at inhibiting thrombus formation when compared with the same dose of ticlopidine alone.8 Mechanism The reason for the bleeding is not known, but ginkgo extract contains ginkgolide B, which is a potent inhibitor of platelet-activating factor in vitro ; this is needed for arachidonate-independent platelet aggregation. However, in one controlled study in healthysubjects, taking a ginkgo preparation alone for 2 weeks had no effecton platelet function. 9Nevertheless, there are case reports of ginkgo supplements, on their own, being associated with prolongedbleeding times, ginkgo and conventional antiplatelet drugs can be additive, leading to bleeding complicationson rare occasions. Importance and management The evidence from these case reports is too slim to advise patients taking aspirin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine to avoid ginkgo, but some do recommend caution, 7which seems prudent, especially as this is generally advised with most combinations of conventional anti- platelet drugs. There may also be a theoretical risk of increasedbleeding if ginkgo is taken with other antiplatelet drugs andanticoagulants; interactions have been reported with NSAIDs, someof which have antiplatelet effects, and with warfarin. Consider also Ginkgo + NSAIDs, page 214 and Ginkgo + Warfarin and related drugs, page 217. 1. Aruna D, Naidu MUR.

Ginkgo + Ginkgo does not significantly affect the of alprazolam. Studies with midazolam suggest that ginkgo mayincrease, decrease or have no effect on its metabolism. Clinical evidence (a) Alprazolam Ginkgo leaf extract 120 mg twice daily for 16 days was given to 12 healthy subjects before and with a single 2-mg dose of alprazolam on day 14. The reduced by 17%, and the maximum concentration was not significantly affected.1 (b) Midazolam In 12 healthy subjects, ginkgo 60 mg four times daily for 28 days did not affect the metabolism of midazolam 8 mg. The ginkgo prepar- ation used and 6%terpene lactones. 2These findings were repeated in a later study using the same criteria in 12 elderly healthy subjects.3In contrast, in another similar study, ginkgo 120 mg twice daily modestly reduced the AUC and maximum serum levels of a single 8-mg dose of midazolam by about one-third. The ginkgo preparation 29% flavonol glycosides and 5% terpene lactones.4 Furthermore, in yet another study in 10 healthy subjects, ginkgo360 mg daily for 28 days increased the AUC of a single 8-mg dose of oral midazolam by about one-quarter. The ginkgo preparation used was Ginkgold , which 24% flavone glycosides and 6% terpene lactones.5 Experimental evidence In an experimental study, unfamiliar pairs of rats were placed together in a novel arena for 10 minutes to determine the effects of combined administration of ginkgo and diazepam on social behaviour. Social contact between rats given ginkgo 96 mg/kg (EGb 761) daily for 8 days and then a single injection of diazepam 1 mg/kg 30 minutes before testing, was significantly higher thanthose given ginkgo or diazepam alone.6 Mechanism Alprazolam for the P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. The studies here show that ginkgo has minimal effects on this isoenzyme, the maximum effect on midazolam being about a 33% reduction in AUC. However, it isunusual for studies to show opposite effects (one of the studies founda minor increase in midazolam AUC), and the reasons for this areunclear, but may be to do with the methodology (use of midazolammetabolic ratios rather than midazolam exposure, and length ofsampling time 4and the fact that in one study the subjects had previously received lopinavir/ritonavir for 30 days, concurrentlywith the ginkgo for 2 weeks, just 2 weeks before the midazolam 4).210 Ginkgo GThe reasons for the experimental findings are not understood but ginkgo may interact with diazepam through its effects on the -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor. Importance and management The pharmacokinetic evidence here shows that alprazolam and midazolam levels are not significantly affected by ginkgo, and noclinically relevant interaction would be expected. The conflictingfinding of the metabolism of midazolam being slightly inhibited inone study andslightly induced in another is, however, unexplained, but either effect would be modest at the most. Alprazolam and midazolam are used as a probe drugs for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a clinically relevantpharmacokinetic interaction as a result of this mechanism betweenginkgo and other CYP3A4 substrates is unlikely.

The ginkgo prepar- ation lactones. 1These findings were repeated in a later study using the same criteria in 12 elderly healthy subjects.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism This study shows that ginkgo has no clinically relevant effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2. Importance and management Evidence from studies in healthy subjects suggests that ginkgo does not affect the metabolism of caffeine and is therefore unlikely to increase its adverse effects. Caffeine is used as a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that apharmacokinetic interaction as a result of this mechanism betweenginkgo and other CYP1A2 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Ginkgo 20 mg/kg approximately doubled the AUC and maximum serum levels of oral diltiazem 30 mg/kg when given to rats1 hour before diltiazem. Ginkgo 20 mg/kg had no significant effect on thelevels of intravenous diltiazem 3 mg/kg. 1 Mechanism The authors suggest that ginkgo may inhibit the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein, both of which would raise diltiazem levels by inhibiting its metabolism orincreasing its absorption, respectively. 1However, in clinical studies, ginkgo had no clinically relevant effect on the P-glycoproteinsubstrate digoxin, page 213, or on the conventional CYP3A4 probesubstrate, midazolam, page 210. Importance and management An interaction between ginkgo and diltiazem has only been demonstrated in one study in rats, and ginkgo does not appear to have clinically relevant effects on the activity of P-glycoprotein oron the metabolism of other CYP3A4 substrates such as thebenzodiazepines. Because the findings of animal studies cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, further study is needed before anyspecific recommendations can be made. Until more is known, bearthe possibility of an interaction in mind in the event of an unexpected response to treatment. 1.

Biol Pharm Nicardipine The interaction between ginkgo and nicardipine is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an experimental study in rats, ginkgo extract 0.5% daily for 4 weeks significantly reduced the hypotensive effects of both oral nicardipine 30 mg/kg and intravenous nicardipine 30 micrograms/kg. 1These findings were repeated in a later study in rats: ginkgo extract 0.5% daily for 2 weeks reduced the maximum serum levelsand AUC of oral may induce the cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP3A, which would increase the metabolism ofnicardipine, a CYP3A4 substrate, and reduce its levels. However,in contrast, studies with diltiazem, page 211 and nifedipine, belowhave shown inhibition of CYP3A4 and increased levels. Moreover, note also that clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition has not been seewith the conventional CYP3A4 probe substrate, midazolam, page 210. Importance and management These experiments in rats suggest that ginkgo can significantly reduce the levels of nicardipine by inducing CYP3A, but note that there is experimental evidence of ginkgo increasing nifedipine anddiltiazem levels. Moreover, clinical studies with CYP3A4 substrates such as the benzodiazepines, page 210, have not shown any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction. Because of this, andbecause the doses used were higher than those used in humans, theanimal data here are unlikely to be of general clinical importance. 1.

Clinical evidence In the preliminary report of a clinical study, 22 healthy subjects were given ginkgo 120 mg daily for 18 days before a single 10-mg oraldose of nifedipine. Ginkgo increased the levels of nifedipine byabout 50%. 1 In another study, a single 240-mg dose of ginkgo extract did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a single 10-mg oral doseof nifedipine when they were given at the same time to 8 healthy subjects. However, the maximum level tended to increase (30% increase), and two subjects experienced a doubling of nifedipinemaximum serum levels. In addition, the incidence and severity ofheadaches, hot flushes and dizziness tended to be higher with thecombination when compared with nifedipine alone. Subjects alsoexperienced increased heart rate with the combination although thedecrease in blood pressure was unaffected. 2The ginkgo extract used in this study contained 24% flavonoids and 6% terpene lactones. Experimental evidence In a study in rats, ginkgo extract 20 mg/kg increased the maximum serum levels and AUC of an oral dose of nifedipine 5 mg/kg by about 60% when they were given at the same time.3Ginkgo extract had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous nifedipine. Mechanism Experimental data3have found that ginkgo has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous nifedipine, suggesting that ginkgo reduces metabolism of nifedipine, a CYP3A4substrate, and increase its levels. Note that simultaneous adminis-tration of single doses is probably insufficient to completely evaluate CYP3A4 inhibition. Note also that clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition has not been seen with the conventional CYP3A4 probesubstrates such as midazolam. See Ginkgo + Benzodiazepines,page 210. Importance and management Limited clinical data suggest that ginkgo may raise the levels of nifedipine and increase its effects. Until more is known, somecaution might be warranted when they are used together. Monitor forsigns of nifedipine adverse effects such as headaches, hot flushes,dizziness and palpitations. If they become apparent, advise thepatient to stop taking ginkgo. 1. Smith M, Lin KM, Zheng YP.

No action is necessarywith combined use, and no pharmacokinetic interaction would beexpected with other substrates of CYP2E1. 1.

Ginkgo + Ciclosporin The interaction between ginkgo and ciclosporin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats, ginkgo extract 8 mL/kg (containing the flavonoid quercetin 775 nanomol/kg) reduced the maximum serum levels and AUC of oral ciclosporin by about 60% and 50% respectively, but had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous ciclosporin.1 Mechanism The authors suggest that the flavonoid component of ginkgo, quercetin, might affect ciclosporin levels cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. However, inclinical studies, ginkgo had no clinically relevant effect on the P- glycoprotein substrate digoxin, page 213, or on midazolam, page 210, a CYP3A4 substrate.212 Ginkgo GImportance and management The evidence for an interaction between ginkgo and ciclosporin is limited to one study in rats. However, ginkgo contains flavonoids, and of these quercetin has been implicated in modest interactionswith ciclosporin in other studies (see Flavonoids + Ciclosporin, page 190 for more information). On this basis, while there is insufficient evidence to suggest that concurrent use should beavoided, there is the possibility that ginkgo may make ciclosporinlevels less stable as the quercetin content of different preparations islikely to vary. Some caution might therefore be prudent onconcurrent use. 1. Yang CY, Chao PDL, Hou YC, Tsai SY, Wen KC, Hsiu SL.

Ginkgo + Dextromethorphan Ginkgo does not appear to affect the metabolism of dextro- methorphan. Clinical evidence Ginkgo leaf extract 120 mg twice daily for 16 days was given to 12 healthy subjects with a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan on day 14. metabolism of dextromethorphan when it was takenafter the ginkgo. 1 In 12 healthy subjects, ginkgo 60 mg four times daily for 28 days did not significantly affect the metabolism of debrisoquine 5 mg. The ginkgo preparation used flavone glycosides and 6% terpene lactones.2These findings were repeated in a later study using the same criteria in 12 elderly healthy subjects.3 Experimental evidence Inin vitro experiments, low-dose and high-dose ginkgo modestly decreased and increased the metabolism of dextromethorphan, respectively.4,5 Mechanism Dextromethorphan is used as a probe substrate for the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6, and the study shows that ginkgo has noclinically relevant effect on this isoenzyme. Studies with debriso-quine, another CYP2D6 substrate, also suggest that ginkgo does notaffect CYP2D6. Importance and management The available evidence seems to reliably suggest that ginkgo does not affect the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan. No action istherefore needed on concurrent use. Dextromethorphan is used as a probe drug for CYP2D6 activity, and therefore these results (along with those for debrisoquine) alsosuggest that a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactionbetween or 3A4 activity in normal volunteers.

Clinical evidence A study in 8 healthy subjects found that ginkgo leaf extract 80 mg three times daily had no significant effects on the pharmacokineticsof a single 500-microgram dose of digoxin. 1 Experimental evidence Inin vitro experiments, ginkgo modestly inhibited the cellular transport of digoxin resulting in the intracellular accumulation of digoxin.2 Mechanism Digoxin is a P-glycoprotein substrate and in vitro studies2suggest that ginkgo may inhibit the activity of this drug transporter protein, which could lead to increased digoxin levels. However, this effectwas not seen clinically. Importance and management The clinical study suggests that ginkgo is unlikely to alter digoxin levels in clinical use. Therefore no dosage adjustment would beexpected to be necessary if patients taking digoxin also wish to take ginkgo. As digoxin is used as a probe substrate for P-glycoprotein, this study also suggests that ginkgo is unlikely to interact with otherdrugs that are substrates of P-glycoprotein. No action is necessarywith use. 1. Mauro VF, LS, Kleshinski JF, biloba on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Am 10, 247 -51. Hellum BH, Nilsen OG.

Ginkgo + Donepezil appear to alter the pharmacokinetics or effectsof donepezil. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a pharmacokinetic study, 14 elderly patients with Alzheimer 's disease were given donepezil 5 mg daily for at least 20 weeks, after which ginkgo extract 90 mg daily was also given for a further30 days. Concurrent use did not affect the pharmacokinetics orcholinesterase activity of donepezil, and cognitive function appearedto be unchanged. 1Therefore, over the course of 30 days, concurrent use appears neither beneficial nor detrimental. No action is necessarywith combined use. 1. Yasui-Furukori N, Furukori H, Kaneda A, Kaneko S, Tateishi T.

Ginkgo + Food No interactions found. Ginkgo + Haloperidol Animal studies suggest that ginkgo may increase extrapyramidal effects in response to haloperidol, but clinical studies do notappear to have reported this effect. Clinical evidence Ginkgo has been tried in schizophrenia as an addition to standard antipsychotics such as haloperidol. For example, in one clinical study, an improvement in positive symptoms was seen in 43 schizophrenic patients given ginkgo extract 360 mg daily withhaloperidol 250 micrograms/kg daily for 12 weeks. 1This study did not report any adverse events. Experimental evidence High-dose ginkgo extract (EGb 761, Tebonin\u00ae), 80 mg/kg daily for 5 days, significantly potentiated the cataleptic adverse effects of haloperidol 2 mg/kg given to rats on the first and last day.2The cataleptic response to haloperidol is used as an animal model of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Mechanism Unknown. Haloperidol is a dopamine D 2-receptor antagonist. It is thought that ginkgo may interfere with dopamine neurotransmission by scavenging nitric oxide, which in turn reduces locomotor activity. Importance and management The authors of the experimental study caution that there is a possibility of an increase in extrapyramidal effects when ginkgo isused with haloperidol. 2However, their study in ratsused high doses, and there are clinical studies investigating the addition of ginkgo tohaloperidol that do not mention this adverse effect. Nevertheless, a clinical study specifically of extrapyramidal effects would be required to investigate this further. It may be prudent to be awareof this possible interaction in case there is an unexpected outcome inpatients taking haloperidol and ginkgo. 1. Zhang XY, Zhou DF, Su JM, Zhang PY.

Ginkgo + Herbal medicines; Valerian A case report describes psychotic symptoms in a woman whotook ginkgo with valerian, but an interaction was not establishedas the cause. Clinical evidence A 51-year-old woman taking valerian 1 to 2 g daily and an unknown amount of ginkgo daily, and who regularly consumed over 1 L ofwine daily, was admitted to hospital after a fainting episode andchanges in mental status. Over the next couple of days she exhibiteda variety of psychotic symptoms including paranoid delusions, disorganised behaviour, anxiety and auditory hallucinations. Her blood-alcohol level was zero on admission and there was noevidence of alcohol withdrawal during her stay in hospital. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unclear. Valerian has been associated with CNS depressant effects when given alone and ginkgo is used primarily to improve cognitivefunction and memory loss. Alcohol, valerian and ginkgo were alsoall being withdrawn at the same time. These factors make it difficultto find the exact cause of the psychotic symptoms. Importance and management This appears to be the only case report in the literature and, because of the multiple factors involved, such as a history of alcohol abuse, itis difficult to assess its general importance. Bear this interaction inmind in case of an adverse response to the combination of ginkgoand valerian. 1. Chen D, Klesmer J, Giovanniello A, Katz J. Mental status changes in an alcohol abuser taking valerian and Ginkgo biloba. Am J Addict (2002) 11, 75 -7. Ginkgo + NSAIDs An isolated case describes fatal intracerebral bleeding in apatient taking ginkgo with ibuprofen, and another describesprolonged subdural taking Studies with flurbiprofen showed that ginkgo had no effect on thepharmacokinetics of these drugs. Clinical evidence A case of fatal intracerebral bleeding has been reported in a 71-year- old patient taking a ginkgo supplement ( Gingium ) 4 weeks after he started to take ibuprofen 600 mg daily.1A 69-year-old man taking a ginkgo supplement and rofecoxib had a subdural haematoma after a head injury, then recurrent small spontaneous haematomas. He wassubsequently found to have a prolonged bleeding time, whichreturned to normal 1 week after stopping the ginkgo supplement and rofecoxib , and remained normal after restarting low-dose rofecoxib .2 A placebo-controlled study in 11 healthy subjects who were given ginkgo leaf ( Ginkgold ) 120 mg twice daily for three doses, followed by a single 100-mg dose of flurbiprofen , found that the pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen were unchanged.3 A study in 12 healthy subjects who were given diclofenac 50 mg twice daily for 14 days, with ginkgo extract ( Ginkgold ) 120 mg twice daily on days 8 to 15, found no alteration in the AUC or oral clearance of diclofenac .4 Experimental evidence See Mechanism, below. Mechanism The reason for the bleeding is not known, but ginkgo extract contains ginkgolide B, which is a potent inhibitor of platelet- activating factor in vitro , which is needed for arachidonate- independent platelet aggregation. However, in one controlled study in healthy subjects, taking a ginkgo preparation alone for 2 weekshad no effect on platelet function. 5Nevertheless, there are case reports of ginkgo supplements, on their own, being associated withprolonged bleeding times, of COX-2 such as rofecoxib have no effect on platelets and would not be expected to potentiate any bleeding effectof ginkgo. The pharmacokinetic studies involving diclofenac and flurbipro- fen were designed to identify whether ginkgo exerted an inhibitoryeffect on cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, and confirm thatginkgo has no effect on this isoenzyme. Importance and management The evidence from these reports is too slim to forbid patients to take NSAIDs and ginkgo concurrently, but some do recommend caution. 12Medical professionals should be aware of the possibility of increased bleeding tendency with ginkgo, and report any suspected cases.9 For other reports of bleeding events with ginkgo see Ginkgo + Antiplatelet drugs, page 209, and Ginkgo Warfarin and relateddrugs, page 217. 1.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an experimental study in rats, ginkgo extract 0.5% daily (equating to about 1.3 g/kg) for 2 weeks modestly reduced the maximum serum levels of a single 90-mg/kg dose of phenobarbital by about35%, and reduced the AUC by about 18% (not statisticallysignificant). Conversely, the phenobarbital-induced sleeping time was reduced markedly from about 8 hours to about 3 hours. The ginkgo extract used was standardised to 24% flavonoids and P450 isoenzyme subfamily, which would increase the metabolism of phenobarbital, aCYP2B6 substrate, and reduce its levels. However, the modest reduction in levels seen with high-dose ginkgo does not explain the marked reduction in sleeping time. Importance and management The evidence for this interaction is limited to an animal study and the doses used are far higher than those used in humans. It is therefore difficult to assess the clinical relevance of this interaction. If anything, it would appear that the interaction may be beneficial (reduced sedation), but this is far from established.For details of possible interactions with other antiepileptics, see Ginkgo + Antiepileptics, page 209. 1.

Ginkgo + Propranolol The interaction between ginkgo and propranolol is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence The maximum serum levels and AUC of propranolol 10 mg/kg given to rats, pretreated with ginkgo extract 100 mg/kg (EGb 761) for 10 days, were reduced by about 40% and 45% respectively when compared with propranolol alone. The serum levels and AUC of its metabolite, N-desisopropylpropranolol, were increased by about 70% and 55%. Ginkgo extract 10 mg/kg had no effect. 1 Mechanism The authors suggested that ginkgo may induce the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, which is one of the majorenzymes involved in the metabolism of propranolol. Ginkgo would therefore reduce the levels of propranolol by inducing its metabol- ism. However, compare caffeine, page 211. Importance and management This experiment in rats suggests that high-dose ginkgo might significantly reduce the levels of propranolol by inducing CYP1A2. However, a human study using caffeine as a CYP1A2 probe substrate found that ginkgo does not affect CYP1A2 to a clinically relevant extent (see Ginkgo + Caffeine, page 211). Therefore aninteraction with propranolol based on this mechanism is unlikely tobe clinically important. 1. Zhao L-Z, Huang M, Chen J, Ee PLR, Chan E, Duan W, Guan Y-Y , Hong Y-H, Chen X, Zhou S. Induction of propranolol metabolism by Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 in rats. Curr Drug Metab (2006) 7, 577 -87. Ginkgo + Protease inhibitors Ginkgo does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics oflopinavir/ritonavir. Clinical evidence In a study in 14 healthy subjects, ginkgo 120 mg twice daily for 2 weeks had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir /ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily (given for 2 weeks alone before adding the ginkgo). The ginkgo extract was and 5% terpene lactones.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The authors suggest that, without ritonavir, the levels of lopinavir would have been reduced by ginkgo because they also found thatginkgo modestly reduced the levels of midazolam, it attenuates the action ofginkgo on lopinavir metabolism. However, note that all protease inhibitors are inhibitors of CYP3A4 to varying extents, and note also that, in other studies with midazolam, ginkgo had no effect onGinkgo 215 Gmidazolam levels, or even caused a minor increase in levels, which suggests that ginkgo does not have a clinically relevant effect onCYP3A4 activity. Consider also Ginkgo + Benzodiazepines, page 210. Importance and management The study here shows that ginkgo does not alter the pharmaco- kinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir, and no special precautions arerequired on concurrent use. This would apply to all otherritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors. As regards protease inhibitorsthat are not boosted by ritonavir, the authors of this study recommend avoiding ginkgo. 1This seems an over-cautious approach, given that the sum of studies available shows that ginkgo does not have a clinically relevant effect on the probe CYP3A4substrate midazolam. 1. Robertson SM, Davey RT, V oell Alfaro midazolam fexofenadine pharmacokinetics 591 -9. Ginkgo + Proton pump inhibitors Ginkgo induces the metabolism of omeprazole. Most otherproton pump inhibitors are likely to be similarly affected. Clinical evidence In one study, 18 healthy Chinese subjects were given a single 40-mg dose of omeprazole before and after a 12-day course of a standardised extract of ginkgo 140 mg twice daily. The subjectswere divided into three groups: homozygous extensive CYP2C19metabolisers (6 extensive poor CYP2C19 metabolisers (7). AUC omeprazole was modestly decreased by 42%, 27% and 40%, respectively, and the plasma levels of the inactive metabolite, hydroxyomeprazole, were increased by 38%, 100% and 232% in the three groups, respectively. Renal clearance of hydroxyomeprazolewas also reduced by ginkgo. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It was concluded that ginkgo increases the metabolism (hydroxyl- ation) of omeprazole by inducing the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP2C19. Importance and management This appears to be the only study examining the effects of ginkgo on proton pump inhibitors. However, the reduction seen in the AUC of omeprazole (about 40%) suggests that there is a possibility that omeprazole will be less effective in patients taking ginkgo. As allPPIs are metabolised by CYP2C19 to varying extents, it is likely thatthe effects of ginkgo seen in these studies will be similar with otherPPIs, although note that rabeprazole is much less dependent on this route of metabolism than other PPIs. There is insufficient evidence to generally recommend that ginkgo should be avoided in patients taking PPIs. However, the potential reduction in the efficacy of the PPI should be borne in mind, particular where the consequences may be serious, such as inpatients with healing ulcers. 1. Yin OQP, Tomlinson B, Waye MMY, Chow AHL, with genetics (2004) 14, 841 -50.Ginkgo + Risperidone An isolated case describes priapism in a patient takingrisperidone and ginkgo. Clinical evidence A 26-year-old paranoid schizophrenic who had been taking risperidone 3 mg daily for the past 3 years developed priapism thathad lasted for 4 hours 2 weeks after starting ginkgo 160 mg daily foroccasional tinnitus. The priapism required treatment, and both ginkgo and risperidone were stopped. Risperidone was then restarted and the patient reported no further episodes of priapism at follow-up6 months later. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unclear. Risperidone alone does rarely cause priapism, probably because of its alpha-adrenergic properties, and ginkgo might havevascular effects that could be additive. Ginkgo is unlikely to inhibitthe metabolism of risperidone by inhibiting the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2D6 because it has no clinical effect on otherCYP2D6 substrates. See Ginkgo + Dextromethorphan, page 213. Importance and management The use of ginkgo is widespread and this appears to be the only report in the literature of an interaction with risperidone. Its generalrelevance is therefore unclear. Bear it in mind in the event of anunexpected response to treatment. 1. Lin Y-Y , Chu S-J, Tsai S-H. Association between priapism of between ginkgo and theophylline is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an experimental study in ratspretreated with oral ginkgo extract 100 mg/kg daily for 5 days, the serum levels and AUC of a single 10 mg/kg oral dose of theophylline given on day 6 were reduced byabout 20% and 40%, respectively. The clearance was increased by 70%. A less marked effect was seen with ginkgo 10 mg/kg (30% increase in clearance). Similar results were seen with intravenoustheophylline 10 mg/kg. 1 Mechanism This interaction is thought to be due to the induction of the cytochrome asubstrate by inducing the activity of this isoenzyme, theophylline is more readily metabolised and cleared from the body. However, ginkgo had no relevant effect on another CYP1A2substrate, caffeine, in humans. See Ginkgo + Caffeine, page 211. Importance and management The evidence for this interaction is limited to experimental data and the dose of ginkgo used is far higher than the most common clinical dose. A human study using caffeine as a CYP1A2 probe substrate, found that ginkgo does not affect CYP1A2 to a clinically relevant216 Ginkgo Gextent. Therefore an interaction with theophylline based on this mechanism is unlikely to be clinically important. 1. Tang J, Sun J, Zhang Y, Li L, Cui F, He Z. Herb-drug interactions: Effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline in rats. Food Chem Toxicol (2007) 45, 2441- 5. Ginkgo + Tolbutamide Gingko does not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on themetabolism or blood-glucose-lowering effects of tolbutamide. Clinical evidence In healthy subjects, ginkgo extract ( Ginkgold ) 120 mg twice daily for 7 days had no effect on the urinary metabolic ratio of tolbutamide. 1 In another study in 10 healthy subjects, ginkgo 360 mg daily for 28 days slightly reduced the AUC of a single 125-mg oral dose of tolbutamide by about 16%, with no significant changes in otherpharmacokinetic parameters. The ginkgo product used was Gink- were not signifi-cantly altered although there was a tendency towards the attenuationof its hypoglycaemic effects by ginkgo (14% reduction). 2 Experimental evidence In an experimental study, ginkgo 32 mg/kg given daily for 5 days before a single 40-mg/kg dose of tolbutamide significantly reduced its blood-glucose-lowering effects in aged rats. However, when a single 100-mg/kg dose of ginkgo was given with a single 40-mg/kg dose of tolbutamide, the blood-glucose levels were significantlylower, when compared with tolbutamide alone, suggesting thatginkgo potentiated the blood-glucose-lowering effects of tolbut-amide. 3 Mechanism It was suggested that ginkgo might induce the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, by which is metabolised. How-ever, the clinical study shows that ginkgo has little or no clinicallyrelevant effect on CYP2C9. The disparate effects between single andmultiple dose administration in the animal study are not understood. Importance and management From the clinical evidence, it is clear that ginkgo has little, if any, effect on the metabolism and blood-glucose-lowering effects of tolbutamide. A clinically relevant interaction therefore seemsunlikely. Tolbutamide is used as a probe drug for CYP2C9 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a clinically relevantpharmacokinetic interaction between ginkgo and other CYP2C9substrates is unlikely. 1.

Clinical evidence An 80-year-old woman with Alzheimer 's disease became comatose a few days after starting to take low-dose trazodone 20 mg twice dailyand ginkgo. The patient woke immediately after being given flumazenil 1 mg intravenously.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It was suggested that the flavonoids in the ginkgo had a subclinical direct effect on the benzodiazepine receptor. In addition, it wassuggested that ginkgo increased the metabolism of trazodone The increased levels of themetabolite were thought to have enhanced the release of GABA(-aminobutyric acid). Flumazenil may have blocked the direct effect of the flavonoids, thus causing the GABA activity to fallbelow the level required to have a clinical effect. However, note thatclinically relevant CYP3A4 induction has not been seen with theconventional CYP3A4 probe substrate midazolam. See Ginkgo + Benzodiazepines, page 210. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between ginkgo and trazodone appears to be limited to this isolated case, from which no general conclusionscan be drawn. Bear this interaction in mind in case of an unexpectedresponse to concurrent use. 1. Galluzzi S, Zanetti O, Binetti G, Trabucchi M, Frisoni GB. Coma in a patient with Alzheimer 's disease taking low dose trazodone and ginkgo biloba. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry (2000) 68, 679 -80. Ginkgo + Warfarin and related drugs Evidence from pharmacological studies in patients and healthysubjects suggests that ginkgo does not usually interact withwarfarin. However, an isolated report describes intracerebralhaemorrhage associated with the use of ginkgo and warfarin,and there are a few reports of bleeding associated with the use ofginkgo alone. Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study in 21 patients stabilised on warfarin , ginkgo extract 100 mg daily (Bio-Biloba ) for 4 weeks did not alter the INR or the required dose of warfarin , when compared with placebo.1Similarly, in another study in healthy subjects,2 Tavonin (containing standardised dry extract EGb 761 of ginkgo equivalent to 2 g of leaf) two tablets three times daily for 2 weeks did not affect either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (INR)of a single dose of warfarin given on day 7. Moreover, a retrospective review of 21 clinical cases involving the concurrentuse of ginkgo and warfarin also found no evidence of altered INRs.3 Conversely, a report describes an intracerebral haemorrhage, which occurred in an elderly woman within 2 months of her startingto take ginkgo. Her prothrombin time was found to be 16.9 seconds and her partial thromboplastin time was 35.5 seconds. She had been taking warfarin uneventfully for 5 years.4The author of the report speculated that ginkgo may have contributed towards the haemor-rhage. Experimental evidence Inanimal studies it was found that the AUC of warfarin was decreased by 23.4% when the ginkgo extract EGb 761 was given, and the prothrombin time was also reduced by EGb 761, which would suggest that ginkgo should reduce the effects of warfarin .3 Mechanism Uncertain. Isolated cases of bleeding have been reported with ginkgo alone (which have been the subject of a review5). In pharmacological studies, ginkgo extract alone did not alter coagulation parameters or platelet aggregation.2,3Moreover, the experimental study suggests that ginkgo might reduce the effects of warfarin. Ginkgo extractsGinkgo 217 Galso do not appear to affect the metabolism of a number of substrates of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme apharmacokinetic interaction with warfarin, which is metabolised by this route, is unlikely. Consider also Ginkgo + NSAIDs, page 214, and Ginkgo + Tolbutamide, page 217. Importance and management There is good evidence from pharmacological studies in patients and healthy subjects that ginkgo extract would not be expected tointeract with warfarin. However, there is one case report of over-anticoagulation, and a few reports of bleeding with ginkgo alone. This is insufficient evidence to justify advising patients taking warfarin to avoid ginkgo ,but they should be warned to monitor for early signs of bruising or bleeding and seek informed professionaladvice if any bleeding problems arise.Consider also Ginkgo + Antiplatelet drugs, page 209, and Ginkgo + NSAIDs, page 214 for other reports of bleeding events. 1.

The main constituents are the saponin glycosides such as the ginsenosides or or the eleutherosides inEleutherococcus senticosus , which are chemically different. Also present are volatile oilscontaining mainly sesquiterpenes. Use and indications Ginseng is used to enhance the body 's resistance to stress and to improve mental and physical performance. It has alsobeen used for diabetes, insomnia, sexual inadequacy, fordegenerative conditions associated with ageing, to improvehealing and as a stimulant.Pharmacokinetics In vitro studies of various extracts and individual ginseno- sides from Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) and Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) have generally found little to suggest that they interfere with the activity of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.1-5This also seems to be the case for Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng) and the eleutherosides.3,5 The ginsenosides have been reported to inhibit CYP1A2 to some extent,6and various ginsenoside metabolites have been found to exert an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4.1-4 However, the clinical relevance of these in vitro findings appears to be small, as clinical studies have found that Panax ginseng and Eleutherococcus senticosus do not affect CYP3A4 (see benzodiazepines, page 222) or CYP2D6 (see dextromethorphan, page 223), and Panax ginseng also does not affect CYP1A2 (see caffeine, page 222) or CYP2E1 (seechlorzoxazone, page 222). Some ginsenosides have been shown to be substrates for P-glycoprotein in vitro, and may actually inhibit its activ- ity. 4,7Whether this is clinically relevant is uncertain. Interactions overview Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng), Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) and Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siber- ian ginseng) appear to modestly lower blood-glucose levelsand may therefore potentiate the blood-glucose-loweringeffects of conventional oral antidiabetics, although this wasnot demonstrated in one study. Panax ginseng andPanax quinquefolius may reduce the effects of warfarin. As both ginsengs also contain antiplatelet components, excessive bleeding cannot be ruled out. Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolius and Eleutherococcus senticosus may also interfere digoxin assays and, although the evidence islimited, the psychoactive effects of ginseng may be additivewith those of MAOIs. Preliminary study suggests that Panax ginseng may increase the clearance of albendazole and alcohol, but the clinical significance of this is not clear.Panax ginseng is a constituent of some Chinese herbal medicines.

Drug Metab Dispos Ginseng GGinseng + Albendazole The interaction between Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) and albendazole is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ) 10 mg/kg given intravenously to rats, increased the intestinal clearance of intravenous albendazole sulfoxide 10 mg/kg, the active metabolite of albendazole, by about25%. The AUC was not significantly affected. 1 Mechanism Uncertain. Panax ginseng may interfere with the metabolism of albendazole. Importance and management The findings of this study using intravenous Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) may not apply to oral use, as is used clinically. However, even if replicated in humans, the minor changes seen in the clearanceof albendazole would be unlikely to be clinically relevant. Based onthis study, no action is needed if patients taking albendazole alsowish to take Panax ginseng . Garc\u00eda JL, Pulido MM, Prieto JG, \u00c1lvarez AI.

Ginseng + Alcohol Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) increases the clearance of alcohol and lowers blood-alcohol levels. Clinical evidence Fourteen healthy subjects, each acting as their own control, were given alcohol (72 g/65 kg as a 25% solution) with and without a Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ) extract (3 g/65 kg) mixed in with it. They drank the alcohol or the alcohol/ginseng mixture over a 45-minute period in 7 portions, the first four at 5-minute intervals andthe next three at 10-minute intervals. Measurements taken 40 min-utes later showed that the presence of the ginseng lowered blood- alcohol levels by an average of about 39%. The alcohol levels of 10 subjects were lowered by 32 to 51% by the ginseng; 3 showedreductions of 14 to 18% and one showed no changes at all. 1 Experimental evidence In one study in rats, oral Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ) reduced the AUC of alcohol after oral, but not after intraperitoneal, administra- tion;2however, in another study, it increased the clearance of intravenous alcohol.3 Mechanism The reasons for this interaction are uncertain, but it is suggested that Panax ginseng possibly increases the activity of the enzymes (alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase)4that are concerned with the metabolism of the alcohol, thereby increasing the clearance of thealcohol. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) and alcohol comes from a clinical study, which confirms the initial findings of some experimental studies. 2,3What the reduction in blood-alcohol levels means in practical terms is not clear but theauthors of the clinical report suggest the possibility of using Panax ginseng to treat alcoholic patients and those with acute alcohol intoxication; 1however, this suggestion needs confirmation in furtherclinical studies. The available data do, however, suggest that theconcurrent use of alcohol and Panax ginseng is unlikely to be detrimental. 1. Lee FC, Ko JH, Park KJ, Lee JS.

Ginseng + Antidiabetics In patients with diabetes taking various oral antidiabetics,Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) and Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) have both shown modest reductions in post-prandial glucose levels after a glucose tolerance test, but Panax ginseng did not result in any improvement in diabetes control when given for 12 weeks. Clinical evidence In a placebo-controlled crossover study, 19 patients with well- controlled type 2 diabetes were treated with oral Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ) 2 g three times daily 40 minutes before meals in addition to their usual treatment (antidiabetics and/or diet) for12 weeks. The ginseng had no effect on glycosylated blood-glucose,which remained at about 6.5%, but it did slightly decrease the blood-glucose levels after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. All patients inthe study were diet controlled: 5 patients received no additionaltreatment; 3 patients were taking a sulfonylurea ; 3 patients were taking metformin ; 5 patients were taking a sulfonylurea with metformin ; 1 patient was taking a sulfonylurea with metformin androsiglitazone ; 1 patient was taking a sulfonylurea androsigli- tazone ; and 1 patient was taking acarbose .1 In earlier studies by the same research group, single dose Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng ) 3 to 9 g slightly reduced the post- prandial blood-glucose concentrations by about 20 to 24% inpatients with type 2 diabetes when given 40 minutes before or at thesame time as a 25 g oral glucose challenge. These patients werebeing treated with diet alone, sulfonylureas ,o rsulfonylureas plus metformin .2,3When comparing the effect between those receiving antidiabetics and those not, there was no difference, suggesting nospecific drug interaction. 4 Experimental evidence The blood-glucose-lowering effects of Panax quinquefolius (Ameri- can ginseng ) ginseng (Asian ginseng ) has been demon- strated in various animal models, and is not covered here because there is adequate clinical information. In an experimental study, Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng ) also showed signifi- cant blood-glucose-lowering activity in mice.5 MechanismAdditive blood-glucose-lowering effects are theoretically possible when ginseng is given with antidiabetics. However, very limited data suggest no specific interactions with conventional antidiabetics. Importance and management These studies show that Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) and Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) might possess blood-glucose- lowering activity, but the multiple-dose study showed that this was not clinically relevant in patients with well-controlled diabetes. Theavailable data suggest that it is very unlikely that a dramatic hypoglycaemic effect will occur in patients with diabetes. Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng) may also have blood-glucose-lowering properties. 1. Vuksan V, Sung M-K, Sievenpiper Jenkins LA, Nam KY, Arnason JT, Choi M, Naeem A.

Ginseng + Benzodiazepines Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam, and Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) did not alter midazolam metabolism. Clinical evidence A study in 12 healthy subjects found that Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng ), 485 mg twice daily for 15 days, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a single 2-mg dose of alprazolam given with the morning dose on day 14.1 Similarly, in 12 healthy subjects, Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ), 500 mg three times daily for 28 days, did not significantly affect the metabolism of oral midazolam 8 mg. The ginseng preparation used was standardised to 5% ginsenosides.2These findings were repeated in a later study using the same criteria in 12 elderly healthy subjects.3 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism These studies showed that neither Eleutherococcus senticosus nor Panax ginseng had any effect on isoenzyme CYP3A4, by which alprazolam and midazolam are metabolised. Importance and management These studies suggest that both Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) and Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng) are unlikely to affect the metabolism of alprazolam and midazolam. Therefore no dosage adjustments would appear necessary on concurrent use. Alprazolam and midazolam are used as probe drugs for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that an interactionbetween Panax ginseng orEleutherococcus senticosus and these benzodiazepines as a result of this mechanism is unlikely. 1.

Ginseng + Caffeine Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) did not alter caffeine metabolism in one study. Note that both ginseng and caffeine have stimulant effects. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ), 500 mg three times daily for 28 days, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of caffeine 100 mg. The ginseng preparation usedwas standardised to 5% ginsenosides.1These findings were repeated in a later study using the same criteria in 12 elderly healthy subjects.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism These studies show that Panax ginseng does not have a clinically significant effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 by which caffeine is metabolised. Importance and management These studies suggest that Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) is unlikely to affect the metabolism of caffeine. Therefore it would not be expected to reduce the effects or increase the adverse effects ofcaffeine. Nevertheless, ginseng is considered to be a stimulant, and itis possible that additive stimulant effects might occur with caffeine,although there do not appear to be many data on this. However, if both substances are given, bear the possibility of increased stimulant effects in mind. Caffeine is used as a probe substrate for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action as a result of this mechanism between Panax ginseng and other CYP1A2 substrates is unlikely.

Ginseng + Carbamazepine For mention that saiko-ka-ryukotsu-borei-to and sho-saiko-to (of which ginseng is one of a number of constituents) did not affect thepharmacokinetics of carbamazepine in animal studies, see Bupleurum + Carbamazepine, page 90. Ginseng + Chlorzoxazone Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) did not alter chlorzoxazone metabolism in one study. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ) 500 mg three times daily for 28 days did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of chlorzoxazone 500 mg. The ginseng prepar-ation used was standardised to 5% ginsenosides. 1These findings were repeated in a later study using the same criteria in 12 elderlyhealthy subjects. 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism These studies show that Panax ginseng does not have a clinically significant effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1 by which chlorzoxazone is metabolised. Importance and management These studies suggest that Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of chlorzoxazone. Chlorzoxazone is222 Ginseng Gused as a probe drug for CYP2E1 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic interaction as a result of thismechanism between Panax ginseng and other CYP2E1 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Ginseng + Dextromethorphan Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng) does not appear to affect the metabolism of dextromethorphan. Clinical evidence A study in 12 healthy subjects found that Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng ), 485 mg twice daily for 14 days, did not significantly affect the metabolism of a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism This study shows that Eleutherococcus senticosus does not have a clinically significant effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 by which dextromethorphan is metabolised. Note also that Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ) had no effect on the metabolism of debrisoquine, another CYP2D6 probe substrate, in clinical pharma- cokinetic interaction studies.2,3 Importance and management This study suggests that Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng) is unlikely to interact with dextromethorphan. Dextro- methorphan and debrisoquine are used as probe drugs for CYP2D6 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmaco-kinetic interaction as a result of this mechanism between Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) or Eleutherococcus senticosus and other effects on CYP3A4 activity in normal volunteers.

Ginseng + Digoxin Ginseng has been shown to interfere with some methods of measuring serum digoxin, see Ginseng + Laboratory tests, below. Ginseng + Food No interactions found.Ginseng + Herbal medicines; Guarana The stimulant effects of guarana, a caffeine-containing herb,appear to be additive to those of Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng). Clinical evidence In a well-controlled single-dose study in healthy subjects, guarana extract 75 mg improved cognitive performance in 'attention 'tasks and Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) 200 mg improved 'memory ' tasks. The combination improved both attention and memory tasks, with no clear evidence for synergistic effects, except for better performance in the increased serial sevens subtractions comparedwith either drug alone. In this study, the ginseng extract wasstandardised to 4% of ginsenosides, and the guarana extract to 11 to13% of xanthines (caffeine and theobromine), or a maximum ofabout 10 mg of caffeine per dose. 1 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical data available, experimental evidence has not been sought. Mechanism Both guarana and ginseng are used for their putative stimulative effects. In this study, they affected different tasks and, in combin-ation, their effects were generally additive. The effect of guarana was not considered to be solely attributable to the caffeine content, since the dose of caffeine was low. 1 Importance and management Caffeine-containing herbs such as guarana are often combined with ginseng for their stimulant and cognitive effects. This study providessome evidence that they do not appear to have synergistic effects,but that the combination is the sum of the different effects of the two herbs. Note that the guarana dose used in this study provided only a low dose of caffeine. 1. Kennedy DO, Haskell CF, Wesnes KA, Scholey AB.

Ginseng + Laboratory tests Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng), Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) and Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng) may interfere with the results of digoxin assays. Clinical evidence A 74-year-old man who had been taking digoxin for many years (serum levels normally in the range 0.9 to 2.2 nanograms/mL) was found, during a routine check, to have digoxin levels of 5.2 nanograms/mL, but without evidence of toxicity or bradycardiaor any other ECG changes. 1The levels remained high even when the digoxin was stopped. It turned out he had also been taking Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng ) capsules. When the ginseng was stopped, the digoxin levels returned to the usual range, anddigoxin was resumed. Later rechallenge with the ginseng caused a rise in his serum digoxin levels. No digoxin ordigitoxin contamination was found in the capsules, and the authors of the report also rejected the idea that the eleutherosides (chemically related to cardiac glycosides) in ginseng might have been convertedin vivo into digoxin , or that the renal elimination of digoxin might have been impaired, since the patient showed no signs of toxicity.1 Experimental evidence Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ),Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng ) and Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng ) have been found digoxin the Beckman (Synchron LX system) monoclonal assay was unaffected by Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ).4 Mechanism Uncertain. One possible explanation is that the ginsengs affected the accuracy of the digoxin assays so that they gave false results. Importance and management The interference in the digoxin measurements described in the assays was not as high as that reported in the elderly patient andthere is some doubt as to whether the herbal medicine taken by thepatient was actually Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian gin- seng). 3,5So, whether this is clinically important, and measurement of serum digoxin levels is actually affected, is uncertain. Neverthe- less it may be sensible to ask about ginseng use when interpreting unexpected digoxin levels and consider using a more specificmonoclonal immunoassay. 1. McRae S.

CMAJ (1996) 155, 1237. Ginseng + MAOIs Case reports describe headache, insomnia and tremulousness, which was attributed to the concurrent use of ginseng andphenelzine. Clinical evidence A 64-year-old woman taking phenelzine [60 mg daily] developed headache, insomnia and tremulousness after taking Natrol High ,a product containing ginseng,1,2probably Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian ginseng ). She had the same symptoms on another occasion after drinking a ginseng tea (type not stated), which she had used without problem before starting phenelzine .1Three years later, while taking phenelzine 45 mg daily, she experienced the same symptoms and an increase in depression 72 hours after starting to take ginsengcapsules (type not stated) and a herbal tea. 2 Another depressed woman taking ginseng (type not stated) and bee pollen experienced relief of her depression and became activeand extremely optimistic when she started to take phenelzine 45 mg daily, but this was accompanied by insomnia, irritability, headachesand vague visual hallucinations. When the phenelzine was stopped and then re-started in the absence of the ginseng and bee pollen, her depression was not relieved.3 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Uncertain. It seems unlikely that the bee pollen had any part to play. Note that the ginsengs have stimulant effects, and adverse effects include insomnia, nervousness, hypertension and euphoria.Importance and management Evidence is limited to three case reports, and the general importance of these poorly documented early cases is unclear. It may be thatthese cases could just represent idiosyncratic reactions, and not bedue to an interaction. The data are therefore too limited to suggest any particular caution. Nevertheless, consider the possibility of an interaction in case of an unexpected response to treatment withphenelzine (or potentially any MAOI) in a patient taking any type ofginseng. 1.

Ginseng + Ofloxacin For mention that sairei-to and sho-saiko-to (of which ginseng is oneof a number of constituents) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin, see Bupleurum + Ofloxacin, page 90. Ginseng + Tamoxifen and other oestrogen antagonists Ginseng may contain oestrogenic compounds that might directly stimulate breast cancer growth and oppose the actions ofcompetitive oestrogen receptor antagonists such as tamoxifen.However, there is some evidence that ginseng use beforediagnosis might not adversely affect breast cancer survival. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In one report ginseng root was listed as an example of a herbal medicine with oestrogenic activity that might directly stimulatebreast cancer growth and oppose the actions of competitiveoestrogen receptor antagonists such as tamoxifen, see Chineseangelica + Oestrogens or Oestrogen antagonists, page 130. However, there is some evidence that ginseng use before diagnosis might not adversely affect breast cancer survival. In theShanghai breast cancer study, 398 women who regularly usedginseng before diagnosis actually had better disease-free and overallsurvival over 5 years than 1057 women who had never used ginseng.Data on ginseng use had been obtained within 66 days of diagnosisof breast cancer. Most of the ginseng used was Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng ) or white Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ), the average daily dose was 1.3 g of ginseng root, and the averagecumulative duration of use was 4.3 months per year. It should benoted that ginseng users were of higher educational achievement andwere more likely to have used tamoxifen (69% versus 61%), bothfactors that might contribute to increased survival. Although ginsenguse post-diagnosis was assessed at follow-up interview, it was notpossible to examine the effect of this on survival since there were nodata on post-diagnosis use of ginseng in patients who had already died. 1While not conclusive, this study does provide some reassur- ance about the use of ginseng in breast cancer. However, a prospective randomised study is required to fully ascertain this. 1. Cui Y , Shu X-O, Gao Y-T, Cai H, Tao M-H, Zheng W. Association of ginseng use with survival and quality of life among breast cancer patients. Am J Epidemiol (2006) 163, 645-53.224 Ginseng GGinseng + Tolbutamide For conflicting evidence that sho-saiko-to (of which ginseng is one of 7 constituents) might increase or decrease the rate of absorption oftolbutamide in animal studies, see Bupleurum + Tolbutamide, page 90. Ginseng + Warfarin and related drugs One pharmacological study found that Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) modestly decreased the effect of warfarin,whereas another study found that Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) did not alter the effect of warfarin. Two case reports describe decreased warfarin effects, one with thrombosis, attributed to the use of ginseng (probably Panax ginseng ). Clinical evidence In a placebo-controlled study, 20 healthy subjects were given warfarin 5 mg daily for 3 days alone then again on days 15 to 17 of a3-week course of Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng ) 1 g twice daily. In the 12 subjects given ginseng, the peak INR was modestly reduced by 0.16, compared with a non-significant reduction of 0.02 in the 8 subjects given placebo. There was also a modest reduction inthe AUC of warfarin. In this study, Panax quinquefolius root was ground and capsulated. 1 Evidence from two earlier case reports supports a reduction in warfarin effect. A man taking warfarin long term, and also diltiazem,glyceryl trinitrate and salsalate, had a fall in his INR from 3.1 to 1.5 within 2 weeks of starting to take ginseng capsules ( Ginsana ) three times daily. This preparation contains 100 mg of standardised concentrated ginseng [probably Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng )] in each capsule. Within 2 weeks of stopping the ginseng his INR hadrisen again to 3.3. 2Another patient taking warfarin was found to have thrombosis of a prosthetic aortic valve, with a subtherapeuticINR of 1.4. Three months prior to this episode his INR had becomepersistently subtherapeutic, requiring a progressive increment in his warfarin dose. It was suggested that this might have been because he had begun using a ginseng product (not identified). 3 In contrast, in a randomised, crossover study in 12 healthy subjects, ginseng capsules 1 g three times daily for 2 weeks did notaffect either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (INR) of asingle 25-mg dose of warfarin taken on day 7. The brand of ginsengused was Golden Glow , each capsule containing an extract equivalent to 0.5 g of Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ) root.4 Experimental evidence A study in ratsfailed to find any evidence of an interaction between warfarin and an extract from Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng ).5Seealso Andrographis + Anticoagulants, page 31, for details of a lack of an interaction between Kan Jang, a standardised fixed combinationof extracts from senticosus (Siberian ginseng ), and warfarin. Mechanism It is unclear why ginseng might reduce the efficacy of warfarin, particularly as no pharmacokinetic interaction occurs. In vitro experiments have found that Panax ginseng contains antiplatelet components that inhibit platelet aggregation and thromboxaneformation, 6although antiplatelet activity was not demonstrated in a study in healthy subjects.7If an antiplatelet effect were confirmed, this might suggest the possibility of an increased risk of bleeding with the combination of ginseng and warfarin. There are a fewreports of vaginal bleeding in women using ginseng preparations(unspecified) in the absence of an anticoagulant, 8-10but these are probably due to a possible hormonal effect of ginseng. Importance and management The available evidence suggests that ginseng might decrease the effect of warfarin. It is possible that the effect is greater with, or specific to, Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng), since this interacted in one study whereas Panax ginseng (Asian ginseng) did not. Although the ginseng dose was higher in the Panax ginseng study, the treatment duration was not as long, which may have obscured an effect. Moreover, the two case reports of decreasedwarfarin effects attributed to the use of ginseng were probably Panax ginseng . Until further information becomes available it would seem prudent to be alert for decreased effects of warfarin and relateddrugs in patients using ginseng, particularly Panax quinquefolius . However, the possibility of an increased risk of bleeding due to the antiplatelet component of Panax ginseng cannot entirely be ruled out, although the clinical study suggests that this is unlikely. 1.

Pharmacopoeias Glucosamine Hydrochloride ( ); Glucosamine ( USP 32); Glucosamine Sulfate Sodium Glucosamine Tablets ( USP 32 ). Use and indications Glucosamine is a natural substance found in chitin,mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides. It can be made bythe body, and is found in relatively high concentrations in cartilage, tendons and ligaments. The primary use of supplemental glucosamine is for the treatment of osteoarth-ritis and other joint disorders. It is sometimes given with chondroitin, page 135. Glucosamine in supplements may be prepared synthetically, or extracted from chitin.Pharmacokinetics The oral bioavailability of glucosamine has been estimatedto be about 25 to 50%, probably due to first-pass metabolismin the liver. Glucosamine is rapidly absorbed and distributedinto numerous tissues, with a particular affinity for articular cartilage. 1,2 Interactions overview Glucosamine supplements have modestly increased the INRin a few patients taking warfarin. Increased blood-glucose has been recorded in patients with diabetes, but nointeraction was found in a controlled study. Glucosaminemight modestly increase tetracycline or oxytetracycline levels, and very limited evidence suggests that glucosamine may possibly decrease the efficacy of paracetamol and somecytotoxic antineoplastics. Unnamed diuretics may slightly reduce the efficacy of glucosamine. 1. Setnikar I, Palumbo R, Canali S, Zanolo G. Pharmacokinetics of glucosamine in man. Arzneimittelforschung (1993) 43, 1109 -13. 2.

G 226Glucosamine + Antidiabetics In a controlled study, glucosamine supplements with chondroitin had no effect on glycaemic control in patients taking oralantidiabetic drugs but one report notes that unexpectedincreases in blood-glucose levels have occurred. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In 2000, the Canadian Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Pro- gramme (CADRMP) briefly reported that unexpected increases in blood-glucose levels had occurred in diabetic patients taking glucosamine sulfate, or glucosamine with chondroitin. 1However, in a well-controlled study, Cosamin DS (glucosamine hydrochloride 1.5 g daily with chondroitin sulfate sodium 1.2 g) daily for 90 dayshad no effect on the control of diabetes (glycosylated haemoglobin)in 22 patients with type 2 diabetes, 4 who were diet controlled and18 who were receiving oral antidiabetics (specific drugs not named). 2 Endogenous glucosamine has a role in glucose metabolism, and may increase insulin resistance. In one case, glucosamine also reduced hypoglycaemic episodes in a patient with metastaticinsulinoma. 3 The interaction is not established, and the results of the controlled study suggest that glucosamine supplements are generally unlikelyto affect the control of diabetes. However, it has been suggested that the results of this study may not be applicable to patients in the later stages of diabetes 4(i.e. those with type 2 diabetes who require, or are expected to require, insulin). Therefore it may be prudent to increasemonitoring of blood-glucose in these patients if glucosaminesupplements are taken. Also, if glucose control unexpectedlydeteriorates, bear the possibility of self-medication with supplementssuch as glucosamine in mind. 1.

Glucosamine + Antineoplastics The interaction between glucosamine and antineoplastics is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found Experimental evidence Anin vitro study found that colon and ovary cancer cell lines showed resistance to doxorubicin andetoposide after exposure to glucosamine at a concentration of 10 mmol. Only a weak effect of glucosamine was found in the responsiveness of breast cancer celllines to etoposide .1 Mechanism It is suggested that the expression of topoisomerase II was reduced by the presence of glucosamine. Topoisomerase II is required fordoxorubicin and etoposide to exert their antineoplastic effects;therefore decreasing the levels of this enzyme increased theresistance to these antineoplastics. Importance and management This possible interaction appears not to have been studied in vivo and, until more data are available, the clinical significance of thefindings is unclear. However, the implication is that glucosamine could reduce the efficacy of these antineoplastics. Bear thispossibility in mind should an unexpected response to treatment with topoisomerase inhibitors occur. 1. Yun J, Tomida A, Nagata K Tsuruo. Glucose-regulated stresses confer resistance to VP- 16 in human cancer cells through decreased expression of DNA topoisomerase II. Oncol Res(1995) 7, 583 -90. Glucosamine + Diuretics Limited evidence from a large open study suggests that unnamed diuretics may slightly reduce the efficacy of glucosamine. Clinical evidence In a large open study, 1183 evaluable patients with osteoarthritis were given glucosamine 1.5 g taken daily for an average of 50 days.The overall assessment of efficacy was 'good 'in about 59% of patients and 'sufficient 'in 36%. When response was analysed by concurrent treatment, in the 64 patients also taking diuretics (nonespecifically named), there was a slightly lower incidence of goodefficacy (44%) and a slightly higher incidence of sufficient efficacy(52%), which reached statistical significance. 1However, note that this study was non-randomised, and other patient factors mighttherefore have accounted for these differences. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management The concurrent use of glucosamine and diuretics is probably quite common, and the fact that this old study appears to be the only reportin the literature of a possible interaction, and in itself inconclusive,suggests that any interaction is, in the main, unlikely to be clinicallyimportant. 1.

Glucosamine + Food No interactions found. Glucosamine + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Glucosamine + Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) Limited evidence suggests that glucosamine may reduce the efficacy of paracetamol (acetaminophen).Glucosamine 227 GEvidence, mechanism, importance and management In a survey of herbal medicine use in 122 patients from 6 outpatient clinics, 2 patients with osteoarthritis (a 66-year-old man and a74-year-old woman), had complained of reduced paracetamol(acetaminophen) efficacy when starting glucosamine. The salt of glucosamine used was not mentioned. 1 It has been suggested that increased serum sulfate levels arising from glucosamine sulfate might lead to increased metabolism of paracetamol by sulfate conjugation.2However, there are no studies assessing this. Note that this would only occur with glucosaminesulfate salts and would not occur with glucosamine hydrochloride. The combined use of glucosamine and paracetamol to alleviate the symptoms of osteoarthritis is common, and the limited evidencehere does not provide any reason to suggest any changes to thispractice. 1.

Sulfate could mediate the therapeutic effect of glucosamine sulfate. Metabolism (2001) 50, 767 -70. Glucosamine + Tetracyclines Glucosamine modestly increases tetracycline levels. Clinical evidence A single-dose study in healthy subjects given tetracycline 250 mg alone or with glucosamine 250 mg found that the serum tetracycline levels were 105%, 50% and 25% higher at 2, 3 and 6 hours after administration, respectively, in those patients who had received thecombined treatment. Similar results were found when oxytetra- cycline was given with glucosamine, with the corresponding increases being 36%, 44% and 30% at 2, 3 and 6 hours afteradministration, respectively. 1The AUC of the antibacterials was not reported. In contrast, in another single-dose study in 12 healthy subjects given tetracycline 250 mg alone, and then with glucosamine 125 mg and 250 mg at 1-week intervals, the addition of glucosamine slightlyincreased serum tetracycline levels at 2, 3, 6 and 8 hours, but this was not statistically significant.2 Experimental evidence A study in dogs and mice found that giving glucosamine hydrochloride with radioactive oxytetracycline increased the serum radioactivity, suggesting an increase in serum oxytetracycline levels. In the dogs, the increase in radioactivity was over twofold at 30 minutes, 1 hour and 24 hours after drug administration, whereas in the mice the increase was only greater than twofold at 15 minutes after drug administration.3 Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management These very early studies from the 1950s suggest that glucosamine might cause a modest increase in tetracycline levels. As a result of these studies, it appears that a preparation of oxytetracycline formulated with glucosamine was tried. A modest increase intetracycline or oxytetracycline levels is unlikely to have adverseconsequences, and, if anything, might be slightly beneficial. 1. Welch H, Wright WW, Staffa AW.

In contrast, one case of a decreased INR has been reported whenglucosamine was given with acenocoumarol. Clinical evidence The first indication of a possible interaction was in 2001, when the Canadian Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Program brieflyreported that an increase in INR had been noted when glucosaminewas given to patients taking warfarin, and that INR values decreasedwhen glucosamine was stopped. 1In 2004, a full case report was published. In this case, a 69-year-old man stabilised on warfarin47.5 mg weekly had an increase in his INR from 2.58 to 4.52 4 weeks after starting to take 6 capsules of Cosamin DS (glucosamine hydrochloride 500 mg, sodium chondroitin sulfate 400 mg, manganese ascorbate per capsule) daily. His warfarin dosewas reduced to 40 mg weekly, and his INR returned to the targetrange of 2 to 3 (INR 2.15) with continued Cosamin DS therapy. 2A comment on this report noted that this is twice the usual dose ofglucosamine. 3Since then, one other similar case of a modest rise in INR has been published. A man taking warfarin and glucosamine hydrochloride 500 mg with chondroitin sulfate 400 mg twice daily had a gradual increase in his INR (from 2.3 to 4.7 over 5 weeks)when he trebled the dose of the glucosamine supplement. 4 Analysis of regulatory authority data has revealed other unpub- lished reports. In 2006 the CHM in the UK reported that they hadreceived 7 reports of an increase in INR in patients taking warfarinafter they started taking glucosamine supplements. 5In 2007, a search of the FDA database identified 20 possible cases,4and a search of the WHO database identified 22 possible case reports of an increasein warfarin effect with glucosamine, which originated fromAustralia, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, the UK and the USA. 6In two of the WHO cases, chondroitin was used, but the other caseswere with glucosamine alone. Of 15 reports giving details of time toonset, the increased INR was noted within 3 days (in a 99 year old)and up to 6 months; most commonly the interaction took several weeks to manifest. 6 In contrast, a 71-year-old man stabilised on acenocoumarol 15 mg weekly had a decrease in his INR to 1.6 after taking glucosamine sulfate ( Xicil) 1.5 g daily for 10 days. The glucosamine was stopped and the INR reached 2.1. When the glucosamine was restarted, with an increase in acenocoumarol dose to 17 mg weekly, the INR only reached 1.9. The glucosamine was eventually stopped.7Similarly, the WHO database contained one report of a decreased effect of warfarin with glucosamine.6The Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee have also identidied 12 cases of alterations in INR in patients taking warfarin. Nine of these cases are included inthe WHO report. 8 There do not appear to have been any controlled studies of the effects of glucosamine supplements on the pharmacodynamics orpharmacokinetics of oral anticoagulants. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Glucosamine is a widely used supplement, particularly in the middle-aged and elderly, who are also the group most likely to beusing warfarin or similar anticoagulants. Despite this, there are justthree published reports of a possible interaction, two describingmoderate rises in INR and one a decrease. Even taking into accountthe possible cases reported to regulatory authorities, the interaction would seem to be quite rare. Nevertheless, the cases described suggest that it would be prudent to monitor the INR more closely if228 Glucosamine Gglucosamine is started or stopped. Also, if a patient shows an unexpected change in INR, bear in mind the possibility of self-medication with supplements such as glucosamine. Note that in 2006 the CHM in the UK recommend that patients taking warfarin do not take glucosamine, 5but the subsequent 2007 UK-approved labelling for the prescription-only glucosamine prod-uctAlateris recommends close monitoring when a patient taking a coumarin anticoagulant starts or stops glucosamine. 9 1.

Use and indications Used for inflammatory and infective conditions, such as amoebic dysentery and diarrhoea; gastric and liver disease.The alkaloids are antibacterial, amoebicidal and fungicidal.For details on the uses of berberine, a major constituent of goldenseal, see berberine, page 58. Pharmacokinetics In several in vitro studies, goldenseal root has been identified as a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4,1-4but more modest inhibitory effects were seen clinically with the CYP3A4 probe substrate, midazolam, page 231. Two studies in healthy subjects, found that goldenseal, given for 14 to 28 days, reduced the metabolismor urinary clearance of debrisoquine, a probe substrate ofCYP2D6, by 36% and 47%, respectively. 5,6In vitro studies CYP2D6 probe, dextromethorphan also foundthat goldenseal inhibits CYP2D6, and suggested that thismay be, at least in part, due to berberine; hydrastine had noeffects on CYP2D6. 4 Goldenseal has also been reported to possibly have someinhibitory effect on CYP2C84(see paclitaxel, page 232) and CYP2C93(see diclofenac, page 231). Another study4 suggested that goldenseal had no significant effect onCYP2E1 (see chlorzoxazone, page 231), CYP1A2 (seecaffeine, page 231) or CYP2C19. In addition, there is some in vitro evidence of P-glycoprotein inhibition, 4but no effect was seen on the levels of digoxin, page 232, which is used as a probe substrate of this transporter. For information on the pharmacokinetics of the constituent berberine, see under berberine, page 58. Interactions overview Goldenseal appears to modestly decrease the metabolism of midazolam, but has no significant effects on the pharmaco- kinetics of indinavir or digoxin. Goldenseal does not appear to affect the metabolism of caffeine or chlorzoxazone. The interaction between gold- enseal and diclofenac, paclitaxel or tolbutamide is based on experimental evidence only.

Clinical evidence A study in 12 healthy subjects investigated the effects of goldenseal 900 mg three times daily taken for 28 days on a single 8-mg dose oforal midazolam. Goldenseal reduced the metabolism of midazolamto hydroxymidazolam by about 40%. The supplement used had no standardisation information. 1Similarly, in a study in 16 healthy subjects given a single 8-mg dose of midazolam after goldenseal 1323 mg three times daily for 14 days, there was a significantincrease in the maximum concentration and AUC of midazolam of41% and 62%, respectively, and a reduction in the clearance of about36%. These increases were considered moderate when comparedwith the effects of clarithromycin and rifampicin in the study, which produced a 448% increase and 93% decrease in the AUC of midazolam, respectively. The goldenseal product used gave anestimated daily dose of berberine of about 77 mg and of hydrastineof 132 mg. 2 Experimental evidence Goldenseal appears to be a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 in Pharmacokinetics, page 230. Mechanism A standardised goldenseal extract appears to modestly inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, which is the major route ofmidazolam metabolism. Concurrent use therefore raises midazolamlevels. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between goldenseal and midazolam is based on clinical studies in healthy subjects. They suggest that somecaution might be appropriate if patients taking goldenseal supple-ments are given oral midazolam; however, the effects were modest.Nevertheless, the clinical effects of this interaction do not appear tohave been studied and so it may be prudent to be aware of the smallpossibility of increased sedation if midazolam is given to patientstaking goldenseal supplements. Any interaction is unlikely to be significant in patients given a single dose of intravenous or oral midazolam pre-operatively. Midazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a modest pharmacokineticinteraction between goldenseal and other CYP3A4 substrates ispossible. See the metabolised bythe cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, page 8, for a list of known CYP3A4 substrates. For mention of an animal study of the possible anxiolytic effect of high-dose berberine and its interaction with diazepam, see Berberine + Anxiolytics, page 59. 1.

Goldenseal + Caffeine Goldenseal did not affect caffeine metabolism in one study. Clinical evidence A study in 12 healthy subjects found that a goldenseal supplement 900 mg three times daily taken for 28 days had no significant effectson the metabolism of a single 100-mg oral dose of caffeine.1The supplement used had no standardisation information. Experimental evidence See under Mechanism, below. Mechanism A standardised goldenseal extract did not inhibit CYP1A2 in vitro ,2 nor did goldenseal have a clinically relevant effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 activity using caffeine as aprobe substrate. Importance and management This study suggests that goldenseal does not have any clinically relevant effect on caffeine metabolism in healthy subjects. Caffeine is used as a probe substrate for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action as a result of this mechanism between goldenseal and other CYP1A2 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Goldenseal + Chlorzoxazone Goldenseal did not affect chlorzoxazone metabolism in one study. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, a goldenseal supplement 900 mg three times daily taken for 28 days had no significant effects on the metabolism of a single oral dose of chlorzoxazone 250 mg.1The supplement used had no standardisation information. Experimental evidence See under Mechanism, below. Mechanism A standardised goldenseal extract did not inhibit CYP2E1 in vitro ,2 nor did goldenseal have a clinically relevant effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1 activity using chlorzoxazoneas a probe substrate. Importance and management Evidence from the clinical study suggests that goldenseal is unlikely to affect the metabolism of chlorzoxazone. Chlorzoxazone is used as a probe substrate for CYP2E1 activity, and therefore these resultsalso suggest that a pharmacokinetic interaction as a result of thismechanism between goldenseal and other CYP2E1 substrates isunlikely. 1.

Goldenseal + Diclofenac The interaction between goldenseal and diclofenac is based on experimental evidence only.Goldenseal 231 GEvidence, mechanism, importance and management Anin vitro study investigated the effects of a goldenseal extract, (containing equal amounts of the active constituents hydrastine and berberine) on the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP2C9 in human liver microsomes, using diclofenac as probe drug. Goldenseal 0.98% inhibited the hydroxylation of diclofenac by about 50%. When berberine and hydrastine were tested separately,hydrastine inhibited CYP2C9 to a greater extent than berberine. 1 However, note that another in vitro study found that goldenseal had little effect on the metabolism of tolbutamide, page 233, anotherprobe drug for CYP2C9 activity. The general relevance of this is unknown as there are no clinical studies reporting the effects of goldenseal on CYP2C9. However,note that in the study cited here, goldenseal was about five timesmore potent as an inhibitor of CYP3A4 than CYP2C9, andclinically, goldenseal has only a modest effect on the CYP3A4substrate midazolam, page 231. This provides some indication thatCYP2C9 inhibition by goldenseal might not be clinically relevant.However, a clinical study is needed to confirm this. 1. Chatterjee P, Franklin MR. Human cytochrome P450 inhibition and metabolic- intermediate complex formation by goldenseal extract and its methylenedioxyphenyl components. Drug 1391 -7. Goldenseal + Digoxin Goldenseal only very small effects on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Clinical evidence A study in 20 healthy subjects given a single 500-microgram dose of digoxin before and on the last day of treatment with standardisedgoldenseal root extract 1070 mg three times daily for 14 days, found a 14% increase in the maximum digoxin plasma levels, but no other changes in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The product gave anestimated daily dose of berberine of about 77 mg and of hydrastineof about 132 mg. 1 Experimental evidence See under Mechanism, below. Mechanism It was suggested that constituents of goldenseal may alter digoxin pharmacokinetics by affecting P-glycoprotein, modulators of P-glycoprotein in vitro . 2However, the clinical study showed that goldenseal does not cause clinicallyrelevant changes in digoxin pharmacokinetics. 1 Importance and management Evidence from the clinical study suggests that goldenseal has only very modest effects on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, whichwould not be expected to be clinically relevant. No dosageadjustment would be expected to be necessary if patients taking digoxin also wish to take goldenseal. Digoxin is used as a probe substrate for P-glycoprotein activity and therefore this study also suggests that goldenseal is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on the transport of other drugs byP-glycoprotein. 1.

Goldenseal + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Goldenseal + Indinavir Goldenseal does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics ofindinavir. Clinical evidence In a study in 10 healthy subjects, goldenseal root ( Nature 'sW a y ) 1.14 g twice daily for 2 weeks did not alter the mean peak plasma level, half-life or oral clearance of a single 800-mg dose of indinavir.Eight of the subjects had less than a 20% increase or decrease in oralclearance, but one subject had a 46% increase and one a 46%decrease. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Studies using the probe substrate midazolam have suggested that goldenseal is a modest inhibitor of CYP3A4, and it was therefore predicted to inhibit the metabolism of indinavir, which is a substrate for CYP3A4. However, the study here suggests that goldenseal doesnot have a significant effect on indinavir metabolism. The contrast-ing results might be explained by indinavir having a relatively highoral bioavailability compared with midazolam. 1Alternatively, because indinavir is also a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, as well asa substrate of CYP3A4, the inhibitory effects of indinavir may havenegated the minor inhibitory effects of goldenseal. Importance and management The clinical study suggests that goldenseal root has no clinically significant effects on indinavir metabolism, and may be takenwithout any undue concern in patients also taking this proteaseinhibitor. However, confirmation may be required in light of themidazolam probe study and the two subjects who experienced arelatively greater change in indinavir oral clearance. Further study is needed before firm clinical recommendations can be made. 1. Sandhu RS, Prescilla RP, Simonelli TM, Edwards DJ. Influence of root on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir. 1283- + Paclitaxel The interaction between goldenseal and paclitaxel is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes, an aqueous and ethanolic goldenseal extract inhibited CYP2C8 activity by about 50 to 60% when used at a concentration of 20 micromol alkaloids (sumof hydrastine and berberine), and had a lesser effect at 1 micromol(40%). However, because of wide confidence intervals, only the 60% decrease with the ethanolic extract was statistically significant. Paclitaxel was used as a probe cytochrome P450 isoenzyme232 Goldenseal GCYP2C8 substrate, and therefore this study also suggests that goldenseal has the potential to inhibit the metabolism of otherCYP2C8 substrates. When studied individually, both berberine and hydrastine had some CYP2C8 inhibitory activity (also not statistic- ally significant). 1 The general relevance of the effect of goldenseal on paclitaxel metabolism is unknown as there are no clinical studies reporting theeffects of goldenseal on CYP2C8 substrates. Note that high-doseberberine blocked the anticancer effects of paclitaxel in one in vitro study, see Berberine + Paclitaxel, page 60, and therefore, until moredata are available, some caution may be prudent. 1.

Goldenseal + Tolbutamide The interaction between goldenseal and tolbutamide is based on experimental evidence only.Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Anin vitro study investigated the effects of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of goldenseal on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9 as activity of hydroxylase. The activityof CYP2C9 was increased by about 35% when incubated with the extract with an alkaloid concentration of 1 micromol, but this was only statistically significant for the ethanolic extract. Moreover, thehigher alkaloid concentration of 20 micromol had no effect. 1Note that another in vitro study found that goldenseal inhibited the metabolism of diclofenac, page 231, a probe drug for CYP2C9. The clinical relevance of these results is unknown, and the disparate findings of goldenseal on CYP2C9 are not easily explained, but any effect was modest. Therefore goldenseal would be expected to have only modest, if any, effects on the response totolbutamide. Further study is needed to assess these effects. 1.

An in vitro evaluation of cytochrome milk thistle, and ginseng Gotu kola contains a wide range of triterpene saponinglycosides such as asiaticoside (to which it may and madecassic acids are also present and these are considered to be the main active constituents. Flavonoids based on quercetin and kaempferol, and a small amount ofvolatile oil containing farnesene, germacrene-D, other terpenes are also present.Use and indications Gotu kola is widely used, mainly for inflammatorydermatological disorders and to aid the healing of ulcersand wounds. It is applied externally and taken internally forvenous insufficiency and as an immunomodulator and antioxidant, and for many other conditions including mem- ory enhancement, circulatory disorders and anxiety. Anumber of pharmacological and clinical studies supportsome of these activities. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. For information onthe pharmacokinetics of the individual flavonoids present in gotu kola, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview No interactions with gotu kola found. For information on the interactions of the individual flavonoids present in gotu kola,see under Synonym(s) and related species Citrus paradisi Macfad. Grapefruit is a hybrid of the Pummelo or Pomelo ( Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr) with the sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis quercetin and others. The peel contains a volatile oil, mostly composed of limonene. Note that some grapefruit seed extracts have been found to contain preservatives such as benzethonium chloride, triclosan and methyl- p-hydroxybenzoate, which might be present because of the methods of production. Use and indications Grapefruit is used as a source of flavonoids (citrusbioflavonoids), which are widely used for their supposedantioxidant effects, and are covered under flavonoids,page 186. Grapefruit seed extracts are used for their antimicrobial properties, but there is some controversy that this might bedue to preservative content rather than natural constituents.Grapefruit and grapefruit juice are commonly ingested as part of the diet, and the oil is used as a fragrance. Pharmacokinetics Most of the data on the pharmacokinetics of grapefruit relate to the juice, which are summarised below. Note that it should not be directly extrapolated to herbal medicines containing grapefruit, because some differences in interaction potentialhave been seen. For information on the pharmacokinetics ofthe flavonoid constituents of grapefruit, see under flavo- noids, page 186, and for information on the furanocoumarin constituents of grapefruit, see under natural coumarins,page 297. (a) Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes Grapefruit irreversibly inhibit thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, and to cause drug interactions in quantities as low as 200 mL. 1Several compounds present are known to have inhibitory effects on CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 in vitro, with the most potent thought to be the furanocoumarins, particularlydihydroxybergamottin, and the flavonoids naringenin andquercetin. 2However, are respon- sible for the well-established clinical interactions ofgrapefruit juice are still uncertain. Naringin is present ingrapefruit, but absent from other citrus fruits which led to the suggestion that naringin is the active principle, but this was later refuted. 3Quercetin has been reported to inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro; however, a clinical study found that, unlike grapefruit juice, quercetin alone, given at a concen-tration 40 times that found in the grapefruit juice, had nosignificant effect on the metabolism of nifedipine byCYP3A4. 4Furanocoumarins may also contribute to the interactions of grapefruit juice, because furanocoumarin-freegrapefruit juice did not interact with felodipine, page 237, inone study. 5Nevertheless, none of the furanocoumarins individually appears to have much effect, and it appears that the net effect of all the furanocoumarins present determines the clinical effect.3,6The effect of grapefruit juice on CYP3A is thought to be mainly exerted on intestinalCYP3A rather than hepatic CYP3A, because drugs given intravenously tend to be affected only to a small extent. (b) P-glycoprotein Based on the results of in vitro and interaction studies, it is thought that some component of grapefruit juice inhibits the activity of P-glycoprotein. However, note that there is no significant interaction with digoxin, a substrate of P-glycoprotein. (c) Organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) In vitro, grapefruit juice has been shown to inhibit theorganic anion-transporting protein (OATP), has also beenconfirmed in another in vitro study. 7Inhibition of this transporter protein results in a modest reduction in the bioavailability of drugs that are substrates for this trans- porter, such as fexofenadine, page 237. Interactions overview The vast majority of known drug interactions of grapefruithave been reported with grapefruit juice, which is not used as a medicine or dietary supplement. For this reason, theseinteractions are not included here in detail, but they aresummarised in the table Summary of established druginteractions of grapefruit juice, page 236. While most clinically important interactions of grapefruit juice result in an increase in drug exposure, note that modest decreased exposure occurs with the beta blockers celiprolol and talinolol, and with the antihistamine, fexofenadine. The interactions of grapefruit juice are probably also applicable to the consumption of the fresh fruit, as reported with carbamazepine and some calcium-channel blockers,G 235such as felodipine. An interaction has also been reported with grapefruit marmalade and tacrolimus. However, grape- fruit juice interactions cannot be directly extrapolated to other grapefruit products such as the citrus bioflavonoids. Ingeneral, bioflavonoids are unlikely to interact to the sameextent as grapefruit juice, because usually the furanocou- marins are required for a significant interaction to occur. However, there is evidence that citrus bioflavonoids alonemight have an important interaction with lovastatin andsimvastatin. For interactions of individual bioflavonoids present in grapefruit supplements, see under flavonoids, page 186, and for the interaction of individual furanocoumarins,see under natural coumarins, page 297. There is one report of grapefruit seed extract interacting with warfarin; however, this was shown be due to thepreservative content rather than the grapefruit extract.1. Bailey DG, Dresser GK.

Manufacturer actually advises avoidance of grapefruit juice with these drugs.236 Grapefruit GGrapefruit + Caffeine For mention that grapefruit juice and one of its constituents naringin, a grapefruit flavonoid, had no effect on the metabolism of caffeine, see Flavonoids + Caffeine, page 189. Grapefruit + Calcium-channel blockers Grapefruit segments increase the exposure to nifedipine, nisoldipine and felodipine. Clinical evidence In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in 12 healthy subjects, homogenised grapefruit segments or an extract from the segment-free parts increased the AUC of felodipine by 3.2-fold and 3.6-fold, respectively.1This increase was the same or slightly greater than the increase seen with 250 mL of grapefruit juice.1In another single- dose study in 8 healthy subjects, grapefruit pulp from one grapefruitincreased the AUC of both nifedipine andnisoldipine by about 30%, and increased the maximum concentration of nifedipine and nisoldipine by about 40% and 50%, respectively, when the grapefruit was eaten 1 hour before taking the calcium-channel blocker. Theauthors noted that these increases were smaller than those previouslyseen with grapefruit juice. 2 Experimental evidence Because these interactions are established, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Grapefruit appears to inhibit the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A subfamily in the intestinal wall so that the first- pass metabolism of these calcium-channel blockers is reduced, thereby increasing their bioavailability and therefore their effects.Grapefruit juice is well established to have this effect. One small clinical study suggests that quercetin is not involved in the interaction between grapefruit juice and nifedipine. 3 Importance and management These interactions are established. It has been suggested that whole grapefruit should be avoided in patients taking felodipine.1Given the data here, this would appear to be prudent advice. It has also been suggested that other products made from whole grapefruit suchas marmalade should be avoided,1although there is no published evidence that grapefruit marmalade may interact with calcium-channel blockers. However, an isolated case describes raisedtacrolimus levels and toxicity associated with the excessiveconsumption of grapefruit marmalade. See Grapefruit + Tacrolimus, below. For mention that furanocoumarin-free grapefruit juice had no consistent effect on felodipine pharmacokinetics, but also that no individual furanocoumarin tested had an effect as great as grapefruitjuice, see Natural coumarins + Felodipine, page 300. Some caution would also be appropriate with nifedipine and nisoldipine. There appears to be no specific information on a potential interaction between whole grapefruit and other calcium- channel blockers. However, it may be worth considering aninteraction with grapefruit in any patient who complains of anotherwise unexplained increase in adverse effects with any of thecalcium-channel blockers. 1.

Grapefruit + Carbamazepine A case of possible carbamazepine toxicity has been seen when a man taking carbamazepine started to eat grapefruit. Clinical evidence A 58-year-old man, taking carbamazepine 1 g daily for epilepsy developed visual disturbances with diplopia, and was found to have a carbamazepine level of 11 micrograms/mL (therapeutic range 4 to 10 micrograms/mL). Previous levels had not exceeded 5.4 micro-grams/mL. The patient said that one month previously he had startedto eat one whole grapefruit each day. The levels restabilised at5.1 micrograms/mL after the carbamazepine dose was reduced to800 mg daily. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 is the main isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of carbamazepine. Components ofgrapefruit juice are known to inhibit CYP3A4, which in this casewould lead to a reduction in the metabolism of carbamazepine, andtherefore an increase in levels. 1,2 Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between grapefruit and carbamazepine appears to be limited to one isolated case. In this report, the patientcontinued to eat grapefruit, and this was successfully managed by areduction in the carbamazepine dose. However, it should be notedthat intake of a set amount of grapefruit would need to be maintained for this approach to work, and carbamazepine dosage adjustment and monitoring of levels should be undertaken as appropriate. Ifmonitoring is not practical, or regular intake of grapefruit is notdesired, it may be prudent to avoid grapefruit. 1. Bonin B, Vandel P, Vandel S, Kantelip JP.

Grapefruit + Fexofenadine For mention that grapefruit juice and, to a lesser extent, naringin, a grapefruit flavonoid, modestly decrease the AUC of fexofenadine,see Flavonoids + Fexofenadine, page 192. Grapefruit + Food No interactions found. For mention that grapefruit juice and one of its constituents naringin, a grapefruit flavonoid, had no effect on themetabolism of caffeine, see Flavonoids + Caffeine, page 189. Grapefruit + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Note that naringin, a grapefruit flavonoid, andgrapefruit juice do not alter the metabolism of caffeine, seeGrapefruit 237 GFlavonoids + Caffeine, page 97, and so would be unlikely to interact with caffeine in caffeine-containing herbs, page 97. Grapefruit + Tacrolimus A case of tacrolimus toxicity has been seen when a man ate morethan 1.5 kg of grapefruit marmalade during one week. Clinical evidence A 52-year-old man with a liver transplant, stabilised on tacrolimus 3 mg twice daily, began to feel anxious and febrile with continuedtrembling and blurred vision. Within 5 days he deteriorated anddeveloped severe left chest pain. His tacrolimus whole blood levelwas found to be markedly raised to 55.4 micrograms/L from aprevious therapeutic level (between 8 and 13 micrograms/L), and he had renal impairment (serum creatinine of 174 micromols/L). It transpired that during the week preceding the onset of symptoms hehad eaten more than 1.5 kg of a home-made marmalade, which wasmade with more than 50% grapefruit. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It is well established that grapefruit juice increases levels of tacrolimus, and this case appears to show that this can occur with grapefruit marmalade. The process of making marmalade uses thewhole fruit, and it appears that, whatever the active interactingconstituents are, these are not destroyed by the long boiling. 1 Importance and management This is the first case to show that a drug interaction can occur with grapefruit marmalade. As such, it requires confirmation by furtherstudy. Note that, in this case, the patient consumed an unusuallylarge amount of marmalade (estimated 14 dessert spoonfuls (15 g)daily). More modest consumption (a spoonful of about 15 g daily)would appear unlikely to interact. Note that grapefruit juice is well established to interact with tacrolimus and combined use should beavoided. 1. Peynaud D, Charpiat B, Vial T, Gallavardin M, Ducerf C. Tacrolimus severe overdosage after intake of masked grapefruit in orange marmalade. Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2007) 63, 721-2.Grapefruit + Warfarin A rise in INR occurred in a couple taking warfarin who took agrapefruit seed extract product containing considerable amountsof the preservative benzethonium chloride for 3 days. One ofthem developed a minor haematoma. Clinical evidence A couple, both well stabilised on warfarin, took some drops of a grapefruit seed extract product ( Estratto di Semillas di Pompelmo , Lakshmi, Italy) for 3 days. No more was taken, but after a further3 days the woman developed a minor subcutaneous haematoma, andher INR was found to be 7.9. The man was found to have an INR of5.1, with no evidence of bleeding. 1 Experimental evidence See under Mechanism, below. Mechanism The product used was stated to contain grapefruit seed extract, glycerol and water. However, chemical analysis of this productrevealed that it also contained considerable amounts (77 mg/mL) ofthe preservative, benzethonium chloride, and did not contain anysignificant amount of natural substances from grapefruit seeds. Theconstituents of two other commercial grapefruit seed products were similar on analysis ( Citroseed andCitricidal ). Further, in vitro analysis showed that benzethonium chloride, and the three products, were potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, suggesting that they could inhibit the metab-olism of warfarin. Importance and management Data presented in this report, and other papers (one of which is cited as an example 2), suggest that the primary constituent of many grapefruit seed extract products appears to be the preservative benzethonium chloride. The evidence from the two cases, backed byin vitro data, suggests that this has the potential to interact with warfarin. On this basis, it would probably be prudent for patientstaking warfarin to avoid grapefruit seed extract products, or forconcurrent use to be monitored closely. Some caution might also beappropriate with other pharmaceutical preparations containing benzethonium chloride. 1. Brandin H, Myrberg O, Rundl\u00f6f T, Arvidsson AK, Brenning G. Adverse effects by artificial grapefruit seed extract products in patients on warfarin therapy. Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2007) 63, 565 Takeoka G, Dao L, Wong RY , Lundin R, Mahoney N. Identification of benzethonium chloride in commercial grapefruit seed extracts. J Agric Food Chem (2001) 49, 3316 - 20.238 Grapefruit Vitis vinifera is the Grape vine, of which there are many cultivars. Constituents Grapeseed extract contains flavonoids , which and tocotrienols are also present. Use and indications Grapeseed extract is promoted as an antioxidant supplementfor preventing degenerative disorders in particular, in the same way as other flavonoid-containing products. The in vitro antioxidant properties are well documented and there is some clinical evidence to suggest that it can promote generalcardiovascular health. Pharmacokinetics Anin vitro study found that grapeseed extract potently inhibits CYP3A4, but only when the catechin content is high.1In contrast, another in vitro study found that grapeseed extract is a weak inducer of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. The author suggests that grapeseed therefore hasthe potential to cause interactions. 2However, the effect of grapeseed extract was less than that of omeprazole, which does not commonly interact by this mechanism, suggesting that any effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Further-more, a study in ratssuggests that grapeseed extract does notsignificantly alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam,page 240, a probe substrate for CYP3A4. Another in vitro study found that grapeseed extract does not affect the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C19 andCYP2E1, and only moderately inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 at high concentrations of catechins. 1In addition, it has no significant effect on P-glycoprotein.1 Grapeseed extracts appear to moderately inhibit the transporter protein OATP-B, but the clinical implications of this have not been established.3 See under flavonoids, page 186, for information on the individual flavonoids present in grapeseed, and see under resveratrol, page 335, for the pharmacokinetics of resvera- trol. Interactions overview Contrary to expectation, the concurrent use of grapeseed extracts and ascorbic acid may have detrimental cardiovas- cular effects. Evidence for other clinically relevant inter- actions appears to be generally lacking. For information onthe interactions of flavonoids, see under flavonoids,page 186, and for the interactions of resveratrol, see under resveratrol, page 335. 1.

Clinical evidence A placebo-controlled study in 69 hypertensive patients taking one or more antihypertensive medications investigated the effects on cardiovascular parameters of vitamin C 250 mg twice daily, grapeseed polyphenols 500 mg twice daily, or a combination ofthe two, for 6 weeks. There was a 3-week washout period betweentreatments. Vitamin C alone reduced systolic blood pressure by about 1.8 mmHg, but the grapeseed polyphenols had no effect onblood pressure. However, treatment with the combination of vitaminC and polyphenols increased systolic blood pressure by 4.8 and 6.6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by between 1.5 and 3.2 mmHg. Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilata- tion, and markers of oxidative damage were not significantlyaltered. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Evidence is limited to one study, with no supporting mechanism to explain the effects seen, and so an interaction between vitamin C andgrapeseed extract is not established. The authors of this studysuggest that caution should be used when advising patients withhypertension on taking a combination of vitamin C and grapeseed.However, the general importance of any interaction is difficult toassess as the effect of taking these two supplements together is likelyto vary depending on the patient and the degree to which their hypertension is controlled. It may be prudent to question a patient with poorly controlled blood pressure to establish if they are takingsupplements containing both vitamin C and grapeseed, and discussthe option of stopping them to see if this improves their bloodpressure control. 1.

Grapeseed + Midazolam The interaction between grapeseed and midazolam is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats, a single dose of an aqueous grapeseed extract had no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. However, after one week of treatment, grapeseed extract increasedthe elimination rate of midazolam by about 30%, and reduced itshalf-life by 28%. However, these effects were modest, and the AUCof midazolam was not significantly altered. 1 Mechanism The study in rats suggests that grapeseed weakly induces the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, the main route of midazolam metabolism. Some in vitro studies support this suggestion, although stronger effects may occur if the catechin content is high, seePharmacokinetics, page 239. Importance and management Clinical evidence regarding an interaction between grapeseed and midazolam appears to be lacking. However, evidence from rat studies suggests that a clinically relevant interaction is unlikely andtherefore no dose adjustments of midazolam are likely to be neededif grapeseed extract is also taken. 1.

Constituents Guarana seeds contain xanthine derivatives; principally caffeine (also known as guaranine, up to 7%), with theobromine, theophylline and others, and small amounts of flavonoids, from the flavanol group, such as catechin. Other constituents include saponins and an essential oil containing estragole and anethole. Use and indications The main use is as a tonic or stimulant for tiredness and topromote alertness, which can be attributed to the caffeinecontent.Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of caffeine are discussed undercaffeine, page 97. Interactions overview Guarana contains significant amounts of caffeine, therefore the interactions of caffeine, page 97, are relevant to guarana. Two case reports describe muscular disorders, which wererelated to the use of guarana-containing herbal supplements.For mention of a study in which a herbal supplement containing guarana and black tea, among other ingredients, slightly increased blood pressure, see Tea + Antihyperten-sives, page 383. G 243Guarana + Antihypertensives For mention of a study in which a herbal supplement containing guarana and black tea, among other ingredients, slightly increasedblood pressure, see Tea + Antihypertensives, page 383. Guarana + Food No interactions found; however, the effects of caffeine from herbalmedicines or supplements containing guarana and caffeine-contain- ing foods or beverages will be additive. Guarana + Herbal medicines Two case reports describe muscular disorders in patients who took supplements containing guarana and ephedra, and guaranaand kava.Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A case report describes a 54-year-old woman, with no significant medical history, who developed rhabdomyolysis after she started totake guarana 190 mg and ephedra 150 mg (containing ephedrine 12 mg), with other dietary supplements. The creatine kinase elevations resolved within 3 weeks of stopping the herbal weight- loss supplement. The authors of this report suggest that, as guaranacontains caffeine alkaloids, this and the combination of ephedrineeffects may have contributed to the myopathy. 1Another case describes myoglobinuria in a patient taking a supplement containingguarana, ginkgo andkava .2Again, this was thought to be related to the combined effects of guarana and other herbal medicines, in this case, kava. The general importance of these cases is unclear, and many patients taking drugs that are known to cause muscle damage such as the statins, frequently take caffeine, which is found in guarana, foodor beverages. The caffeine content of guarana suggests that it may interact with other herbal medicines in the same way as caffeine, see Caffeine +Herbal medicines; Bitter orange, page 101, and Ephedra + Caffeine, page 176. 1.

However, the clinical signifi-cance of this is unclear and further study is needed. 1 Interactions overview In healthy subjects, the absorption of diltiazem andpropranolol was modestly reduced by gugulipid. If the mechanism is confirmed, guggul might interact with a wide range of other drugs. A case of rhabdomyolysis has beenattributed to the use of guggul alone, which should be bornein mind if it is combined with the statins, which also, rarely, cause this adverse effect. 1.

J Pharmacol Exp Ther (2004) 310, 528 -35. G 245Guggul + Diltiazem Limited evidence suggests that guggul modestly reduces the absorption of single-dose diltiazem. Clinical evidence A crossover study in 7 fasting healthy subjects found that a single 1-g dose of gugulipid reduced the AUC and maximum concentration of a single 60-mg dose of diltiazem by 35% and 41%, respectively.This single dose of diltiazem did not have any effect on blood pressure or heart rate in these particular subjects, 1so it was not possible to assess the effect of the reduction in levels of diltiazem on its pharmacological effects. No details were given of the gugulipid or diltiazem preparations used. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Gugulipid is an oleoresin extracted from guggul. The authors of this study suggest that it might bind with drugs in the gut and reducetheir absorption in a similar way to colestyramine and colestipol. 1 Importance and management Gugulipid modestly reduced the absorption of diltiazem in this study, and this degree of reduction is probably unlikely to be clinically relevant. However, the formulation of diltiazem given wasnot stated and the effects of multiple dosing, or of larger doses ofdiltiazem, is unknown. Further study is needed. Bear in mind thepotential for an interaction should a patient taking guggul have areduced response to on bioavailability of diltiazem and propranolol. J Assoc Physicians India (1994) 42, 454 -5. Guggul + Food No interactions found. Guggul + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Guggul + Propranolol Limited evidence suggests that guggul modestly reduces theabsorption of single-dose propranolol. Clinical evidence A crossover study in 10 fasting healthy subjects found that a single 1-g dose of gugulipid reduced the AUC and maximum concentration of a single 40-mg dose of propranolol by 34% and 43%, respectively. This single dose of propranolol did not have any effect on blood pressure or heart rate in these particular subjects,1so it was not possible to assess the effect of the reduction in levels ofpropranolol on its pharmacological effects. No details were given ofthe gugulipid or propranolol preparations used. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Gugulipid is an oleoresin extracted from guggul. The authors of this study suggest that it might bind with drugs in the gut and reducetheir absorption in a similar way to colestyramine and colestipol. 1 Importance and management Gugulipid modestly reduced the absorption of propranolol in this study. The clinical relevance of this reduction is not certain, but it islikely to be minor. Bear in mind the potential for an interactionshould a patient taking guggul have a reduced response Pohujani on bioavailability of diltiazem and propranolol. J (1994) 42, 454 -5. Guggul + Statins An isolated case suggests that guggul alone can cause rhabdomyolysis. If statins are also taken, the risk could be additive. Clinical evidence A case of rhabdomyolysis has been reported in a patient, 2 weeks after an extract of guggul 300 mg three times daily was started. Therhabdomyolysis resolved when the guggul preparation was stopped.The patient was not reported to be taking any other medication known to cause rhabdomyolysis and simvastatin had been stopped one year previously because of an increase in creatine kinase. Theherbal product used was prepared by a local chemist using astandardised drug extract of the oleo gum resin without excipients. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Not known. The possibility that the resin used was adulterated was not investigated. Importance and management This appears to be the only case report of rhabdomyolysis occurring with a guggul-containing preparation. Guggul is widely used for cholesterol lowering, and the most commonly used conventional drugs for this condition are the statins, which are well recognised,rarely, to cause rhabdomyolysis. It is quite likely that guggul andstatins are being used together, and the concern generated by thiscase report is that, if guggul alone can cause rhabdomyolysis, thencombined use might increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. However,this is only one case, and the mechanism (which could includeadulteration) is uncertain. Bear the possibility of an additive effect in mind if myositis occurs with concurrent use. All patients taking statins should be warned about the symptoms of myopathy and toldto report muscle pain or weakness. It would be prudent to reinforcethis advice if they are known to be taking guggul. 1.

Constituents The leaves and flowers of hawthorn are usually standardised to their flavonoid content, and the berries may be standard- ised to their procyanidin content. Other flavonoids present include isoquercetin and andrutin. Other polyphenolic chlorogenicand dopamine, and ursolic and oleanolic acid triterpenenoid derivatives. Use and indications Hawthorn extracts are used as a cardiotonic, mild anti-hypertensive and antisclerotic.Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present inhawthorn, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview The safety of hawthorn extracts was investigated in a comprehensive systematic review,1which included data up to January 2005 from the WHO, relevant medical journals and conference proceedings. The investigators found that166 adverse events were reported in 5577 patients from 24 clinical studies, and 18 cases of adverse events were reported via the WHO spontaneous reporting scheme. None of theseinvolved drug interactions. In the clinical studies assessed,the daily dose and duration of treatment with hawthorn preparations ranged from 160 to 1800 mg and from 3 to 24 weeks, and the extracts most used contained leaves andflowers and were WS 1442 (standardised 2.25% flavonoids). Other studies do not appear to haveidentified any clinically significant drug interactions.

H 247Hawthorn + Antidiabetics Hawthorn does not appear to affect the glycaemic control in patients taking conventional antidiabetic drugs. Clinical evidence In a randomised study, 80 patients with type 2 diabetes taking antidiabetics (including metformin ,gliclazide and/or low-dose insulin ) with or without antihypertensives were given hawthorn extract 600 mg twice daily, or placebo, for 16 weeks. There was no difference between the two groups in measures of glycaemic control (fasting glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin and fructosamine) at16 weeks. The hawthorn extract used in this study, LI 132, containeddried flowering tops and was standardised to 2.2% flavonoids. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism No mechanism expected. Importance and management Evidence is limited to this one study. However, as no alteration in glycaemic control was reported, no interventions are deemednecessary in patients taking antidiabetics and hawthorn extract. 1. Walker AF, Marakis G, Simpson E, Hope JL, Robinson PA, Hassanein M, Simpson HCR. Hypotensive effects of hawthorn for patients with diabetes taking prescription drugs: a randomised controlled trial. Br J Gen Pract (2006) 56, 437 -43. Hawthorn + Antihypertensives Limited evidence suggests that there may be additive blood pressure-lowering effects if hawthorn is taken with conventional antihypertensives, but the effects are small. Clinical evidence In a randomised study, 80 patients with type 2 diabetes, of whom 71% were taking antihypertensives (including ACE inhibitors , calcium-channel blockers ,beta blockers and/or diuretics ), were given hawthorn extract 600 mg twice daily or placebo for 16 weeks.The group given hawthorn extract (39 of 40 patients assessed) had a small additional 2.6 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure compared with no change in the placebo group. The 3.6 mmHgdecline in systolic blood pressure in the hawthorn group was notstatistically significant. The hawthorn extract used in this study, LI132, contained dried flowering tops and was standardised to 2.2%flavonoids. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Little known. Additive blood pressure-lowering effects might occur. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one clinical study. Although hawthorn extract caused a reduction in diastolic blood pressure inpatients, many of whom were taking antihypertensives, the effect was small. As such, it is unlikely that clinically importanthypotension would occur if hawthorn is added to existing antihypertensive treatment. 1.

Br J Gen Pract (2006) 56, 437 -43. Hawthorn + Digoxin Hawthorn does not appear to affect digoxin levels. Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study, 8 healthy subjects were given hawthorn extract 450 mg twice daily with digoxin 250 micrograms daily for 21 days, or digoxin 250 micrograms alone daily for 10 days. While digoxin levels tended to be lower when hawthorn was given(the biggest difference being a 23% reduction in the trough level),these reductions were not statistically significant. There was nochange in ECG effects or heart rate, and the combination was welltolerated. The hawthorn extract used in this study, WS 1442,contained an extract of leaves with flowers standardised to 84.3 mgof oligomeric procyanidines. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Little known. It was thought that flavonoids in hawthorn might have an effect on P-glycoprotein, of which digoxin is a substrate. In addition, it is possible that the cardioactive constituents of hawthorn might increase the effect of digoxin on cardiac contractility.1 Importance and management This study appears to be the only evidence reported. It suggests that, despite theoretical concerns that hawthorn may affect treatment withdigoxin, in practice there appears to be no clinically relevantalteration in digoxin levels or effects. It therefore appears that hawthorn can be given to patients taking digoxin without the need for further monitoring. 1.

Constituents The leaves of honeybush contain the isoflavones as formonometin and afrormosin, and coumestans such as medicagol. The quantity of flavonoids is reduced when honeybush is fermented; how- ever, the non-flavonoid components increase. Honeybushdoes not contain caffeine. 1 Use and indications Honeybush has been traditionally used in South Africa for avariety of ailments including digestive problems and skinproblems, and to promote lactation. 1Honeybush is princi- pally used to produce a tea-like beverage. There is experi- mental evidence of various activities including antioxidant, chemopreventative, antidiabetic and immunomodulatingeffects. 1 Pharmacokinetics No relevant For the pharmaco- kinetics of individual flavonoids and isoflavones present in honeybush, see flavonoids, page 186, and isoflavones,page 258.

A review of the gordonii (Masson) Sweet ex of Hoodia are also used, but are less well investigated. Constituents The succulent flesh of hoodia contains a large number of oxypregnane known as hoodigosides, and of hoodigogenin) is oftenreferred to as P57AS3 or, more commonly, P57. Use and indications Hoodia is used to suppress appetite and thirst. The activeconstituent, P57, is reported to have a CNS effects.Pharmacokinetics Anin vitro study has shown that P57, an active constituent isolated from Hoodia gordonii , weakly inhibited the action of in a were unaffected by P57. These results suggest that pharmaco- kinetic interactions with substrates of these isoenzymes areunlikely. This study also indicated that P57 may be asubstrate of P-glycoprotein. 1 Interactions overview No interactions with hoodia 1. Magdula VLM, Avula B, Pawar RS, Shukla YJ, Khan IA, Walker LA, Khan SI. In vitro metabolic stability and intestinal transport of P57AS3 (P57) from Hoodia gordonii and its interaction with drug Strobile ( BP 2009 ,Eur Ph 6.4 ). Constituents The flowers (strobiles) of hops contain a volatile oil composed mainly of humulene (alpha-caryophyllene), with beta-caryophyllene, myrcene, farnesene and others. There is also an oleo-resin fraction composed of bitter acids. Flavonoids present include glycosides of kaempferol and quercetin, and a of of the stilbenoid resveratrol and its glucoside, piceid, have also been isolated. Note that a large variety of hops genotypesexist, and the relative content of these constituents may varybetween genotype. Use and indications Hops are used mainly as a sedative, anxiolytic, hypnotic andtranquilliser. These properties have been demonstrated pharmacologically but there is little clinical evidence to date. Hops also contain a number of compounds withoestrogenic activity such as 6-prenylnaringenin. Many products include hops as one of several ingredients rather than as a single extract. There are also many varieties ofhops, normally produced for their flavour and other charac-teristics useful for beer production. The variety used medicinally is usually not stated. Pharmacokinetics Most of the investigations carried out into the metabolism of hops have concerned the metabolism of isoxanthohumol tothe more potent phytoestrogen 8-prenylnaringenin by human liver microsomes,1and by intestinal microflora, particularly in the colon.2,3These studies suggest that the levels of active constituents vary between individuals, and may be altered byantibacterial treatment, which suggests that the activity (particularly the oestrogenic activity 4) of hops, and its potential to interact, is also likely to vary between individ- uals. The involved, 4but information is too sparse to be able to comment further on the potential forconventional drugs to diminish the effects of hops. See under flavonoids, page 186, for information on the individual flavonoids present in hops, and see under resveratrol, page 335, for the pharmacokinetics of resvera- trol. Interactions overview Animal studies suggest that hops extracts potentiate the analgesic effects of paracetamol, suppress the stimulanteffects of cocaine, suppress the effects of diazepam andpotentially alter the sedative effects of pentobarbital.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study of the interactions of various genotypes of hops, mice were given cocaine 25 mg/kg after they had received four intraperitoneal doses of a 0.5% alcoholic extract of hops. Threehops genotypes were used: Aroma, Magnum and wild hops. Thestudy found that the Magnum hops extracts almost completelysuppressed the excitatory effects of cocaine (measured by spontan-eous motility), when compared with controls. Extracts of the wildgenotype also decreased the excitatory effects of cocaine, but to a lesser extent than the Magnum genotype, whereas the Aroma genotype did not alter the effects of cocaine. 1 Mechanism It has been suggested that hops may alter the effects of cocaine on the central nervous system, but it is not known how this occurs. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study in mice, the clinical relevance of which is unclear. What is known suggests that any interaction may be advantageous or, more likely, not clinicallyimportant. Of more interest is the variability in the interactionbetween the different hops genotypes, which suggests that the exactsource of the hops used in any preparation is likely to be ofimportance in establishing their potential for interactions. 1.

Hops + Diazepam The interaction between hops and diazepam is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In study of the interactions of various genotypes of hops, mice were given diazepam 3 mg/kg after they had received four intraperitoneal doses of a 0.5% alcoholic extract of hops. Three hops genotypeswere used: Aroma, Magnum and wild hops. The study found that thehops extracts suppressed the effects of diazepam (assessed by co- ordination of movements). The most pronounced effect occurred with the extracts of Magnum and Aroma genotypes whereas the wildgenotype had no significant effect. 1 Mechanism It has been suggested that hops may prevent diazepam exerting its effect on GABA receptors in the central nervous system, therebydiminishing its effects. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study in mice, the clinical relevance of which is unclear. What is known suggests that hops may diminish the effects of diazepam, which is in contrast to whatwould be expected, given that hops is given for similar reasons todiazepam. It is difficult to extrapolate these findings to humans, but there appears to be no good reason to avoid concurrent use. Of more interest is the variability in the interaction between the different hopsgenotypes, which suggests that the exact source of the hops used inany preparation is likely to be of importance in establishing theirpotential for interactions. 1.

Hops + Food No interactions found. Hops + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Hops + Oestrogens or Oestrogen antagonists Hops contains oestrogenic compounds. This may result in additiveeffects with oestrogens or it may oppose the effects of oestrogens.Similarly, hops may have additive effects with oestrogen antagonistsor oppose the effects of oestrogen antagonists (e.g. tamoxifen). SeeChinese angelica + Oestrogens or Oestrogen antagonists, page 130for more information. Hops + Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) The interaction between hops and paracetamol is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study of the interactions of various genotypes of hops, mice were given paracetamol 80 mg/kg after they had received four intraperitoneal doses of a 0.5% alcoholic extract of hops. Three hops genotypes were used: Aroma, Magnum and wild hops. The studyfound that the hops extracts alone did not possess an analgesic effect,but each of the extracts increased the analgesic effect of paracetamol80 mg/kg, with the most pronounced effect occurring with theextracts of Aroma and wild genotypes hops. 1 Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study in mice, the clinical relevance of which is unclear. What is known suggests that any interaction may be advantageous. Of more interest is the variabilityin the interaction between the different hops genotypes, which suggests that the exact source of the hops used in any preparation is likely to be of importance in establishing their potential forinteractions. 1.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study of the interactions of various genotypes of hops, mice were given pentobarbital 40 mg/kg after they had received four intraperitoneal doses of 0.5% alcoholic extract of hops. Three hopsgenotypes were used: Aroma, Magnum and wild hops. The studyfound that the hops extracts suppressed the hypnotic effects ofpentobarbital (measured by a decrease in the sleeping time of themice). The most pronounced effect occurred with the extracts of Magnum and Aroma genotypes whereas the wild genotype had no significant effect. However, the effects varied greatly between individual mice, with some sleeping for a longer time. 1Mechanism It has been suggested that hops may alter the effects of phenobarbital on the central nervous system, but it is not known how this occurs. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this one study in mice, the clinical relevance of which is unclear. What is known suggests that hops may slightly decrease the sedative effects of pentobarbital in someindividuals, or increase them in others. It is difficult to extrapolatethese findings to humans, but there appears to be no good reason toavoid concurrent use, although patients should be aware that there isa possibility that they may be more or less sedated than with eithermedicine alone. Of more interest is the variability in the interaction between the different hops genotypes, which suggests that the exact source of the hops used in any preparation is likely to be ofimportance in establishing their potential for interactions. 1.

Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet (2007) 32, Constituents Horse chestnut seeds contain more than 30 saponins, a complex mixture known as 'aescin 'or'escin '(to which it may be standardised), based on aglycones protoescigeninand barringtogenol-C. Other compounds , based on quercetin and kaempferol, are also present. The natural coumarins found in horse chestnut (such as aesculin (esculin) and fraxin) do not possess the minimum structural requirements for anticoagulant activity. Use and indications Horse chestnut extracts (aescin) are used to treat vascularinsufficiency, especially varicose veins, venous ulcers,haemorrhoids and inflammation. They are usually appliedas topical preparations, particularly gel formulations, but a licensed oral dosage form is also available. 1There is a considerable body of clinical and pharmacological evidence to support their use. Pharmacokinetics An isolated in vitro study suggests that horse chestnut mayinhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport, assessed usingdigoxin, page 255 as a substrate. In this study, horse chestnut did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. 2 Similarly, in a previous study, the authors briefly noted that, in vitro, horse chestnut had little inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.3For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in horsechestnut, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview One in vitro study suggests that horse chestnut may affect P-glycoprotein, and could therefore affect the pharmaco-kinetics of drugs such as digoxin, although the clinical significance of this is unknown. Some have suggested that horse chestnut may interact with anticoagulants, presumablybased on its natural coumarin content, but the coumarinspresent are not known to possess the structural requirements necessary for anticoagulant activity.

Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol (2007) 100, 23 The interaction between horse chestnut and digoxin is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Anin vitro study to investigate the effects of a horse chestnut product ( Venostat ) on P-glycoprotein transport found that the extract inhibited the transport of digoxin by P-glycoprotein to a minor extent. Nevertheless, the authors predicted that inhibitory levels might easily be reached in the small intestine with usual therapeutic doses of horse chestnut.1 Since this appears to be the only available study, this inhibition of digoxin transport needs confirming, and then an in vivo clinical study would be required to assess whether horse chestnut does alterdigoxin absorption on concurrent use, and whether any changes areclinically relevant. No specific recommendations can be made on the basis of this single in vitro study. 1. Hellum BH, Nilsen OG.

The related species Equisetum hyemale L. has also been used, but note that standardised pharmacopoeial preparations of horsetail should contain no more than 5% of other Equisetum species. Pharmacopoeias Equisetum Stem ( 6.04 ); Horsetail (BP 2009 ). Constituents Horsetail contains high concentrations of silicic acid ,u pt o 8%, and is sometimes used as an organic source of silicon. It also contains flavonoids such as apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin and quercetin and their derivatives, and may be standardised to the total flavonoid content expressed as isoquercitroside . Other polyphenolic compounds such as caffeic acid derivatives, and trace amounts of the alkaloidnicotine, and sterols including cholesterol, isofucosterol andcampesterol, are also present. Horsetail also contains thiaminase (an enzyme that breaks down thiamine), and this is inactivated in some supplements.Use and indications Horsetail is used mainly as an astringent, haemostatic andanti-inflammatory enuresis. There islittle pharmacological, and no clinical, evidence to support the main uses. Pharmacokinetics Anin vitro study using alcoholic extracts of horsetail found that it had only weak inhibitory effects on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4.1For information present in horsetail, seeunder flavonoids, page 186.

You may have come to this monograph via a herb that contains isoflavones. The information in this monograph relates to the individual isoflavones, and the reader is referred back to the herb (and vice versa ) where appropriate. It is very difficult to confidently predict whether a herb that contains one of the isoflavones mentioned will interact in thesame way. The levels of the isoflavone in the particular herb can vary a great deal between specimens, related species, extracts and brands, and it is important to take this intoaccount when viewing the interactions described below. Types, sources and related compounds Isoflavones are plant-derived polyphenolic compounds that are a distinct group of flavonoids, page 186. They can exert oestrogen-like effects, and therefore belong to the family of'phytoestrogens '. Most occur as simple isoflavones, but there are other derivatives such as the coumestans , the pterocarpans and the rotenoids , some of which also have oestrogenic properties. The isoflavones are found in small amounts in many legumes, seeds, grains and vegetables, but soya, page 356, isby far the most concentrated dietary source; it containsprincipally genistein anddaidzein . There are various other isoflavone-rich supplements, including those derived from alfalfa, page 21 and red clover, page 332 (both of which are rich in biochanin A and formononetin ), and kudzu, page 267, which contains puerarin . In addition, some popular herbal medicines, such as astragalus, page 46 and shatavari, page 353 contain isoflavones as well as other types of active constituents. In plants, isoflavones are usually found in the glycoside form, i.e. bound to a sugar molecule, but digestion results inthe release of the sugar molecule leaving the aglycone. Themost isoflavones are: Use and indications Epidemiological studies show that a high dietary intake ofisoflavones from foods such as soya, page 356 might be protective against certain cancers (breast, endometrium,prostate) and degenerative diseases, in the same way as theflavonoids, page 186. Although isoflavone supplements areused for these possible benefits, it remains to be seenwhether they are effective. Many of their biological effects, as with the flavonoids, appear to be related to their ability to modulate cell signalling pathways, and genistein in particu-lar has been widely investigated for its tyrosine kinase- inhibiting properties, and it is now also considered by some to be a SERM (selective oestrogen receptor modulator).Some biologically active constituents of genistein have givencause for concern, as it can be genotoxic and cause cell damage, and it is a topoisomerase II inhibitor. Isoflavones have weak oestrogenic effects, but under certain conditions (for example, in premenopausal women) they can also act as oestrogen antagonists by preventing the more potent natural compounds, such as estriol, from binding to receptor sites. In some cases the activities aretissue selective. Isoflavones also inhibit the synthesis andactivity of enzymes involved in oestrogen and testosterone metabolism, such as aromatase. Because of their oestrogenic effects, isoflavone supple- ments have been investigated for treating menopausalsymptoms such as hot flushes (hot flashes) 1,2and for prevention of menopausal osteoporosis,3with generally modest to no benefits when compared with placebo in randomised controlled studies. Isoflavones have also been extensively studied for lipid lowering,4and there are a few studies on other cardiovascular benefits, and effects on cognitive function. In a 2006 analysis, the American HeartAdvisory Committee concluded that the efficacy and safety of soya isoflavones were not established for any indication and, for this reason, they recommended against the use ofisoflavone supplements in food or pills. 4 Pharmacokinetics The uptake, metabolism and disposition of the isoflavonesare highly complex and have not yet been fully elucidated. Isoflavone glycosides are probably hydrolysed in the gut wall by intestinal beta-glucosidases to release the aglycones(genistein, daidzein, etc.), which can then be absorbed. 5 Intestinal bacteria may also hydrolyse the glycosides, and, in some people, they metabolise daidzein to the more active oestrogen equol.6After absorption, the aglycones are conjugated, predominantly to Gut bacteriaalso extensively isoflavones: example, daidzein be metabolised equol, a metabolite with greater oestrogenic activity than daidzein, but also to othercompounds that are less oestrogenic. 7Because of differences in gut flora, there are individual differences in the meta-bolism of isoflavones, which might have important implica-tions for their effects: for example, studies measuring urinaryequol excretion after soya consumption indicate that onlyI 258about one-third of Western individuals metabolise daidzein to equol.8 In a study in 9 healthy subjects the isoflavone puerarin, given orally, was rapidly absorbed and reached peak levels at2 hours, and had a half-life of about 4.5 hours. The elimination half-life was not significantly altered after repeated administration. The authors concluded that threetimes a day dosing is recommended, as accumulation willnot occur, and plasma levels remain at levels that are biologically active, even 8 hours after the last steady-state dose. 9For mention that colonic bacteria hydrolyse more active aglycone daidzein, see Isoflavones +Antibacterials, page 260. In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, fluvoxamine was a potent inhibitor of genistein andtangeretin metabolism. 10This finding suggests are metabolised by CYP1A2, ofwhich fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor. The relevance ofthis to the activity of these isoflavones is unknown, since therelative activity of the metabolites to the parent isoflavone is unknown. The isoflavones genistein and equol were inhibit the isoenzymes CYP2E1 and CYP1A2, 11 see also theophylline, page 263, but note also that infantformulas, including soya-based formulas, appear to induce CYP1A2, see Soya + Caffeine, page 357. In vitro, the soya isoflavones daidzein and genistein and CYP2C9.13However, in one of these studies,12St John' s wort also inhibited CYP3A4, but clinically this herb isknown to be an inducer of CYP3A4. This highlights the problems of extrapolating the findings of in vitro studies to the clinical situation. 13 Genistein and biochanin A inhibit P-glycoprotein-medi- ated drug transport, for example, see paclitaxel, page 261and digoxin, page 261. Interactions overview The interactions covered in the following sections relate toindividual isoflavones. Some of these may be directly applicable to isoflavone supplements; however, caution must be taken when extrapolating these interactions to herbs or foods known to contain the isoflavone in question. This isbecause the amount of the isoflavone found in the herb or food can be highly variable, and might not be known, and other constituents present in the herb or food might affect thebioavailability or activity of the isoflavone. Therefore,although data on isolated isoflavones are useful, it is no substitute for direct studies of the herb or food in question. 1. Krebs EE, Ensrud KE, MacDonald R, Wilt TJ.

Experimental evidence It is well known that colonic bacteria are involved in the metabolism of isoflavones. For example, it has been shown that equol is exclusively formed from daidzin by colonic bacteria, but that only about one-third of people are equol producers.1In another study, the isoflavone glycosides puerarin and daidzin incubated with human bacteria hydrolysed daidzin to the aglycone daidzein , and a varied between individ- ual specimens. When the oestrogenic effects of the glycosides puerarin anddaidzin were compared of , the aglycone metabolite was more potent.2Intestinal bacteria have also been reported to metabolise daidzein to the more active oestrogen equol.3 However, it is also now established that beta-glucosidases in the intestinal wall are also important for the hydrolysis of glycosides to form the aglycones (see Pharmacokinetics, page 258). Mechanism Colonic bacteria appear to play an important role in the metabolism of soya isoflavones; therefore, it is possible that antibacterials thatdecimate colonic bacteria could alter isoflavone metabolism andbiological activity. Importance and management Evidence is limited to experimental studies that were not designed to study drug interactions; however, what is known suggests that theconcurrent use of antibacterials active against gut flora mighttheoretically alter or reduce the efficacy of some isoflavones.However, there is no clinical evidence to support this suppositionand, in any case, the effect is likely to be temporary. No action istherefore needed. 1. Setchell KDR, Brown NM, Lydeking-Olsen E. The clinical importance of the metabolite equol-a clue to the effectiveness of soy and its isoflavones.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In various studies in animal models of diabetes, a couple of which are cited for information,1,2puerarin , an isoflavone found in kudzu, page 267, has demonstrated blood glucose-lowering effects. Some have interpreted these studies to indicate that kudzu might have additive effects with antidiabetic drugs, and that the dose of antidiabetic medications might need to be adjusted. Given the natureof the evidence, and the fact that it relates to isolated isoflavoneconstituents, this appears to be a very cautious approach. 1.

Isoflavones + Benzodiazepines The interaction between isoflavones and benzodiazepines is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In two experimental studies,1,2the isoflavone puerarin has been shown to be a weak benzodiazepine antagonist. It is therefore theoretically possible that puerarin might reduce the effects of benzodiazepines if given concurrently. However, there is no clinicalevidence to support this supposition. The fact that the informationrelates to an isolated isoflavone, and the effect was only weak, suggests that a clinically important interaction between isoflavones and benzodiazepines is unlikely. 1.

Isoflavones + Cardiovascular drugs; Miscellaneous The interaction between isoflavones and miscellaneous cardio- vascular drugs is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Some experimental studies have shown that isoflavones from kudzu, page 267, may inhibit of platelet aggregation.1In one small study in patients with angina,2treatment with the isoflavone puerarin reduced the activation of platelet surface activity protein. Some have interpreted these studies to indicate that, theoretically, kudzu might increase the risk of bleeding when used withantiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, and that caution is warrantedon concurrent use. Given the nature of the evidence, and the fact thatit relates to isolated isoflavone constituents of kudzu, this appears tobe a very cautious approach. Note that puerarin injection is used in China to treat angina and cardiovascular disease. Clinical studies comparing standard Western treatment ( nitrates ,beta blockers ,calcium-channel blockers , aspirin ,anticoagulants , etc.) with or without puerarin injection have been reviewed. It was concluded that, although adverse events were inadequately reported, treatment including the injection tendedto result in more adverse effects. 3 1.

Available in The The interaction between isoflavones and digoxin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats,biochanin A 100 mg/kg increased the AUC and maximum serum levels of an oral 20-mg/kg dose of digoxin by 75% and 71%, respectively.1No significant changes in mean residence time and terminal half-life of digoxin were observed, suggesting anegligible effect of biochanin A on renal elimination. Mechanism Digoxin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. Biochanin A may modestly inhibit P-glycoprotein, resulting in a moderate increase in oral bioavailability of digoxin. Importance and management There appears to be no clinical data regarding an interaction between biochanin A and digoxin, and the clinical relevance of theexperimental data needs to be determined. However, until more isknown, because of the narrow therapeutic index of digoxin, it may be prudent to be cautious if patients taking digoxin also wish to take supplements containing high doses of biochanin A. Patients shouldbe alert for any evidence of adverse effects, such as bradycardia, andif these occur it may be prudent to monitor digoxin levels. 1.

Isoflavones + Fexofenadine The interaction between isoflavones and fexofenadine is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence The effects of biochanin A on the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine was investigated in rats.Biochanin A 100 mg/kg decreased the oral bioavailability and peak plasma concentration of fexofenadine 20 mg/kg by about 30% and 57%, respectively. No significant changes in mean residence time and terminal half-life wereobserved, suggesting a negligible effect of biochanin A on fexofenadine hepatic or renal elimination.1 Mechanism Fexofenadine is a substrate for P-glycoprotein and OATP, both of which affect fexofenadine uptake. Biochanin A appears to prefer- entially inhibit OATP over P-glycoprotein in the intestine, leading tothe decreased oral absorption of fexofenadine. Importance and management There appear to be no clinical data regarding an interaction between biochanin A and fexofenadine, and therefore the clinical relevanceof the experimental data needs to be determined. However, the modest reduction in bioavailability of fexofenadine suggests that a clinically important interaction is unlikely. No action is thereforerequired. 1.

Isoflavones + Nicotine Soya isoflavones slightly decrease the metabolism of nicotine. Clinical evidence The effects of soya isoflavones on nicotine metabolism were investigated in a study in 7 healthy Japanese subjects who were non-smokers. Taking an isoflavone tablet (containing daidzein 4.2 mg, genistein 5.2 mg and glycitein 600 micrograms) six times daily for 5 days, in addition to their usual diet, slightly reducednicotine metabolism by about 24% (measured 2 hours after chewinga piece of nicotine gum). This was when compared with nicotinemetabolism after abstaining from soya foods for one week. 1 Experimental evidence In vitro , these isoflavones decreased nicotine metabolism, by inhibiting the cytochrome isoenzyme CYP2A6.1 MechanismIsoflavones slightly decrease the metabolism of nicotine by the inhibition of CYP2A6. Importance and management Although evidence is limited to one study, it is a well-designed clinical study. The minor change in nicotine metabolism when thesubjects were taking isoflavones suggests that isoflavone supple-ments are unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on the efficacyof nicotine replacement therapy. No action is therefore needed. 1. Nakajima M, Itoh M, Yamanaka H, Fukami T, Tokudome S, Yamamoto Y Isoflavones + The interaction between isoflavones and paclitaxel is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats, genistein 10 mg/kg given orally 30 minutes before a single dose of oral or intravenous paclitaxel modestly increased the AUC of paclitaxel by 55% and 43%, respectively. The increase inAUC with a lower dose of genistein 3.3 mg/kg was not significant, although it did increase the peak concentration of paclitaxel by67%. 1 In another similar study, biochanin A 100 mg/kg caused a marked 3.8-fold increase in the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel 20 mg/kg.2Isoflavones 261 IMechanism It seems that these isoflavones increase the systemic exposure of oral paclitaxel by inhibiting P-glycoprotein. In addition, isoflavonesmight reduce paclitaxel drug resistance via their effects onP-glycoprotein. Importance and management The available evidence for an interaction between isoflavones and paclitaxel is from experimental studies, the clinical relevance ofwhich needs to be determined. Furthermore, paclitaxel is givenintravenously, and the effect of biochanin A has only been assessedwith oral paclitaxel. However, genistein modestly increased the AUC of intravenous paclitaxel, and therefore, until more is known, some caution might be appropriate with high doses of theseindividual isoflavones, in view of the possibility of increasedexposure and increased toxicity of paclitaxel. 1.

Isoflavones + Tamoxifen The available evidence on the effect of isoflavone supplements on the efficacy of tamoxifen in breast cancer is inconclusive, and theeffect of isoflavones on breast tissue appears to be complex. It ispossible that whether the effect is beneficial or antagonisticmight be related to the dose of isoflavones used, and also theoestrogen status of the patient (pre- or postmenopausal). Evidence and mechanism (a) Breast cancer In various animal studies, soya isoflavones have either inhibited or enhanced the preventative effect of tamoxifen on the development of breast cancer. Note that the body of evidence is vast, and only a selection of representative papers has therefore been cited. For example, in a study in rats given tamoxifen, a diet supplemented with daidzein increased protection against chemically induced breast cancer, whereas a diet supplemented with genistein reduced protection, when compared with tamoxifen alone.1In 'low-dose 'isoflavone-enriched diet ( daid- zein) halved the protective effect of tamoxifen against the develop- ment of breast tumours, whereas a soy meal or 'high-dose ' isoflavones did not have any effect.2In yet another study, genistein and tamoxifen had a synergistic effect on delaying the growth ofoestrogen-dependent breast tumours in mice, especially at lower levels of tamoxifen. 3 Note that disparate findings (both prevention and stimulation) have been found for genistein alone on induction of mammary tumours in animals . It has been suggested that the effect might depend on age, with a preventative effect seen at a young age, and astimulatory effect seen when oestrogen levels are low, as occurspostmenopausally. Note also that there is a large body of epidemio-logical data on the effect of dietary soya products on the risk ofbreast cancer, which suggest a possible reduction in risk. 4 Some animal studies have clearly shown that genistein can antagonise the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on growth of oestro-gen-dependent human breast cancer. 5In an in vitro study, this effect was shown to be biphasic, with low levels of genistein simulating cancer cell growth, and high levels of genistein inhibiting cancer cell growth.2Similarly, in vitro studies have shown that genistein has a synergistic or additive inhibitory effect on the growth of breastcancer cells exposed to tamoxifen, 6or antagonises the response of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen.7 Note that, in one study in 17 women with biopsy-confirmed breast cancer, supplementation with soya isoflavones 200 mg daily for2 weeks did not increase tumour growth over the 2 to 6 weeks beforesurgery. There was a trend towards cancer growth inhibition in theisoflavone treatment group, manifested as an increase in theapoptosis/mitosis ratio, when compared with those from a historical control group, although this was not statistically significant. 8 However, in another study in women requiring surgery for a benign or malignant breast tumour, supplementation with dietary soy,containing isoflavones 45 mg daily for 2 weeks, increased prolifer-ation markers in a healthy zone of the breast. 9Similarly, another study of dietary supplementation with soya protein (providing37.4 mg of genistein daily) for 6 months found an increase in breast secretion (an assessment of breast gland function) in premenopausal women, but a small or lack of an increase, in postmenopausal women and epithelial hyperplasia in about one-third of the women,which was suggestive of oestrogenic breast tissue stimulation inresponse to genistein .10 (b) Menopausal symptoms In a placebo-controlled crossover study in 149 women with a history of breast cancer, about two-thirds of whom were taking tamoxifen,soya isoflavones ( genistein ,daidzein and glycitein ) 50 mg three times daily for 4 weeks had no effect on the incidence of hotflushes. 11Another similar study also reported a lack of efficacy for hot flushes in 157 women breast cancer survivors given a soya beverage (90 mg isoflavones daily) or placebo beverage for 12 weeks, of whom about one-third were taking tamoxifen. Vaginalspotting was reported by 4 women who drank the soya beverage andone woman who drank the placebo beverage, but this was notthought to be due to the soya. 12In a third study, in 72 women with breast cancer, 78% of whom were taking tamoxifen, a soyasupplement (35 mg of isoflavones twice daily; Phytosoya ) for 12 weeks had no effect on menopausal symptoms when comparedwith placebo. 13 These studies are probably too short, and too small, to detect any possible effect of the isoflavones on the efficacy of tamoxifen.Nevertheless, they show that isoflavones are probably no moreeffective than placebo for one of the most common reasons forwhich they are used in this patient group. (c) Tamoxifen metabolism In a cross-sectional study in 380 Asian -American women (including Chinese and Japanese Americans) with breast cancer the serum levels of tamoxifen and its major metabolites dietary soya intake.14 In an in vitro study using female rat liver microsomes, genistein inhibited -hydroxylation of tamoxifen (a minor metabolic route), did not affect 4-hydroxylation, N-demethylation or N-oxidation (major metabolic routes). A to five isoflavones( genistein ,daidzein andglycitein ) inhibited tamoxifen -hydroxylation to a greater extent, but did not decrease the formation of othermetabolites. Studies using selective chemical inhibitors showed thattamoxifen -hydroxylation was mainly mediated by CYP1A2 and CYP3A1/2 in rats. Although -hydroxytamoxifen is a minor metabolite of tamoxifen, it is thought to be responsible for DNAadduct formation and increased risk of endometrial cancer withtamoxifen. The authors concluded that using genistein and its isoflavone analogues with tamoxifen might potentially be beneficial because of the inhibition of the formation of -hydroxytamoxifen.15 However, this requires confirmation in humans. Also, note that isoflavones themselves may not be free of endometrial adverseeffects, for example, in one study, long-term women.16 Importance and management The available evidence on the effect of isoflavone supplements on the efficacy of tamoxifen in breast cancer is inconclusive, and theeffect of isoflavones on breast tissue appears to be complex. It ispossible that whether the effect is beneficial or antagonistic might be related to the dose of isoflavones used, and also the oestrogen status of the patient (pre- or postmenopausal). Because of differences in262 Isoflavones Igut flora, there are individual differences in the metabolism of isoflavones, which might have important implications for theireffects: for example, studies measuring urinary equol (which has more potent oestrogenic effects than daidzein) excretion after soya consumption indicate that only about one-third of Western individ-uals metabolise daidzein to equol. 17 Most authorities recommend that patients taking oestrogen antagonists (that is, drugs such as tamoxifen and the aromataseinhibitors) for breast cancer should avoid isoflavone supplements.Given the available evidence, this seems a sensible precaution,particularly because there is no clear clinical evidence that isoflavones are beneficial for menopausal symptoms in these women. The advice to avoid isoflavone supplements is not usuallyextended to soya foods, although some have argued that availabledata do not appear to warrant making this distinction. 18Further study is needed. 1.

Isoflavones + Theophylline High doses of isoflavones might modestly increase theophylline levels. Clinical evidence In a placebo-controlled study in 20 healthy non-smoking subjects, pre-treatment with daidzein 200 mg twice daily for 10 days increased the AUC and maximum level of a single 100-mg dose oftheophylline by about 34% and 24%, respectively, and increasedthe elimination half-life from about 9 hours to about 12 hours. 1 Experimental evidence The isoflavones genistein and equol were found to inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2.2Conversely, note that soya- based infant formula induced CYP1A2 in vitro , see Soya + Caffeine, page 357. Mechanism Daidzein, and some other isoflavones, appear to be moderate inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, of whichtheophylline is a substrate. Importance and management The dose of daidzein used in this study was higher than that usually taken in isoflavone supplements, or as part of the diet, and the effectson theophylline pharmacokinetics were modest. Nevertheless, bearin mind that high doses of isoflavones might modestly increasetheophylline levels and that this could be clinically important inpatients with theophylline levels already at the higher end of thetherapeutic range. Note that an increase in theophylline levels hasbeen seen in a patient given the synthetic isoflavone, ipriflavone. 3 Aminophylline would be expected to interact similarly. Note also that, conversely, there is evidence that infants receiving formula feeds, (which may include soya-based formula) requirehigher doses of caffeine (which, like theophylline, is a substrate ofCYP1A2) than those that are breastfed, see Soya + Caffeine,page 357. 1.

Use and indications Traditionally kelp has been used as a source of minerals suchas iodine for thyroid deficiency. It has also been used as a slimming supplement. Note that the iodine content in kelp may precipitate hyperthyroidism, and prolonged or excessiveintake is inadvisable. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview Kelp is probably unlikely to interact with warfarin, because, although it is a moderate source of vitamin K 1, and therefore has the potential to reduce the effect of warfarin and related anticoagulants, sufficient vitamin K is very unlikely to beattained with usual doses of kelp supplements. Note also that anticoagulant fucoidans in kelp are unlikely to be orally active. K 265Kelp + Anticoagulants Unintentional and unwanted antagonism of warfarin occurred in one patient when she ate seaweed sushi. It has been suggestedthat kelp contains substances with anticoagulant activity, but theevidence for this is theoretical. Clinical evidence An isolated report describes a patient taking warfarin who had, on two occasions, reduced INRs of 1.6 and 1.8 (usual range 2 to 3) within 24 hours of eating sushi with seaweed (asakusa-nori ). It was estimated that she had consumed only about 45 micrograms of vitamin K 1, which would not usually be sufficient to interact. However, if her vitamin K stores were low, this amount could haveaccounted for a large percentage of her vitamin K intake or stores,and might therefore have interacted. 1Note that kelp is a moderate source of vitamin K, having about 66 micrograms per 100 g.2 However, this means that supplements containing 1 g of kelp willcontain very little vitamin K (0.66 micrograms). Also, when the kelpis used to prepare an infusion, it would be unlikely to contain muchvitamin K 1, because the vitamin is not water soluble. Experimental evidence In experimental studies, fucoidans from brown seaweeds including kelp have demonstrated anticoagulant activity. For example, in one in vitro study, the fucoidan from Fucus serratus had anticoagulant activity, as measured by activated partial thromboplastin time; this was roughly equivalent to 19 units of heparin per mg. The fucoidininhibited Fucus vesiculosus andAscophyllum nodosum had a smaller effect (roughly equivalent to 9 and 13 units of heparin per mg,respectively). 3 Mechanism Kelp is a moderate source of vitamin K, and therefore, if eaten in sufficient quantities, would antagonise the effects of coumarins andindanediones, because these anticoagulants act as vitamin Kantagonists. Fucoidans from kelp may act like heparin and inhibitthrombin activity, and therefore have some anticoagulant effects.However, they are large polysaccharides, and are therefore unlikelyto be orally active.Importance and management The interaction of warfarin with vitamin K from foods is a very well- established, well-documented and clinically important drug -food interaction, expected to occur with every coumarin or indanedioneanticoagulant because they have a common mode of action. However, the evidence suggests that, in patients with normal vitamin K 1status, in general, clinically relevant changes in coagulation status require large continued changes in intake ofvitamin K 1from foods, which would be highly unlikely to be attained from usual doses of kelp supplements. This interactionwould therefore be more applicable to kelp eaten as a food. Fucoids in kelp are very unlikely to be orally active, so kelp supplements would be unlikely to have any anticoagulant activity. Taking the evidence together, there appears to be no reason why patients taking warfarin should particularly avoid taking kelpsupplements. 1.

Much of the research carried out on kudzu has been on the effects of isolated puerarin . Use and indications Kudzu contains isoflavones and is used as a phytoestrogen for menopausal symptoms, with a particular emphasis onbone metabolism for use in postmenopausal osteoporosis. It also has a popular reputation for being able to lower alcohol consumption and to treat symptoms of alcohol intoxication. This effect has not been reported for other isoflavone-containing herbs and the possible mechanism of action is unknown. Kudzu has also been used for migraine and hypertension, pain and stiffness, and angina. The phytoes-trogenic properties are well known, and puerarin is thoughtto be the major component with this effect, which has been well documented in animals . For further details about the general and specific effects of isoflavones, see isoflavones, page 258. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data for kudzu found. Forinformation on the pharmacokinetics of its main isoflavone constituent puerarin, see isoflavones, page 258. Interactions overview Studies in ratssuggest that kudzu can increase the effects of methotrexate. Kudzu contains oestrogenic compounds and therefore it may interact with oestrogens and oestrogenantagonists. Potential interactions of isoflavone constituentsof kudzu are covered under isoflavones; see antibacterials, page 260, antidiabetics, page 260, benzodiazepines, page 260, miscellaneous cardiovascular drugs, page 260,digoxin, page 261, fexofenadine, page 261, nicotine, page 261, paclitaxel, page 261, and theophylline, page 263. K 267Kudzu + Antibacterials No data for kudzu found.

Kudzu + Food No interactions found. Kudzu + Herbal medicines No interactions found.Kudzu + Methotrexate The interaction between kudzu and methotrexate is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a pharmacokinetic study in rats, the use of a kudzu root decoction significantly decreased the elimination and resulted in markedly increased exposure to methotrexate. 1Animals were given metho- trexate, orally or intravenously, alone or with the decoction. Givingthe decoction at a dose of 4 g/kg and 2 g/kg significantly increasedthe AUC of oral methotrexate by about 3-fold and 2.3-fold,respectively. This resulted in high mortality rates (57.1% and14.3%). With intravenous methotrexate, the concurrent use of the decoction at 4 g/kg increased the half-life by 54% and decreased the clearance by 48%. Mechanism Kudzu markedly reduces the elimination of methotrexate. This might occur because of competition for renal of biliary excretion,possibly via organic anion transporter (OAT). 1 Importance and management Evidence is limited to data in rats, and the doses of kudzu used in this study are very high. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that kudzu might markedly increase the effects of methotrexate. Untilmore is known, caution might be appropriate on concurrent use. Therisks are likely to be greatest with high-dose methotrexate (forneoplastic diseases) and in patients with impaired renal function, butless in those given low doses (5 to 25 mg weekly) for psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis and with normal kidney function. Note that the use of methotrexate requires routine monitoring (e.g. of LFTs), andpatients should be advised to report any sign or symptom suggestiveof infection, particularly sore throat (which might possibly indicatethat white cell counts have fallen) or dyspnoea or cough (suggestiveof pulmonary toxicity). 1. Chiang H-M, Fang S-H, Wen K-C, 263 -8. Kudzu + Nicotine For discussion of a study showing that daidzein and genisteinpresent in kudzu caused a minor decrease in the metabolism ofnicotine, see Isoflavones + Nicotine, page 261. Kudzu + Oestrogens or Oestrogen antagonists Kudzu contains oestrogenic compounds. This may result in additive effects to oestrogens or it may oppose the effects of oestrogens. Similarly, kudzu may have additive effects to oestrogen antagonists or oppose the effects of oestrogen antag-onists (e.g. tamoxifen). Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Kudzu has a long history of use for menopausal symptoms, and is known to contain isoflavones (plant oestrogens). Numerous in vitro andanimal studies have demonstrated oestrogenic effects for the herb (too many to cite here). However, few clinical studies have268 Kudzu Kbeen conducted. In one study,1Pueraria mirifica alleviated meno- pausal symptoms in perimenopausal women, but in another study in postmenopausal women,2Pueraria lobata did not alter menopausal symptoms or lipids or hormone levels, and was less effective thanconventional HRT. Theoretically, the isoflavones from kudzu might have oestrogen antagonistic effects when they are given with potent oestrogenicdrugs, as their oestrogenic effects are weaker and they mightcompetitively inhibit the conventional oestrogenic drugs. Con-versely, because of their oestrogenic effects it is possible that theymight reduce the efficacy of potent oestrogen antagonists. Although many studies have been carried out, clinical information on the potential interaction of kudzu with oestrogens or oestrogenantagonists is sparse. On the basis of the postulated oestrogeniceffects of kudzu and the theoretical mechanisms of antagonism,some have recommended caution if kudzu is given with otheroestrogens including hormonal contraceptives, or with oestrogenantagonists such as tamoxifen. However, isoflavones from plants are widely consumed as part of the traditional diet in many parts of the world, and there is no clear evidence that this affects response tohormonal contraceptives or oestrogen antagonists such as tamoxifen.For further information on the oestrogenic effects of isoflavonesupplements, see Isoflavones + Tamoxifen, page 262. 1.

For the possibility that the isoflavones biochanin A and genistein present in kudzu might increase paclitaxellevels, see Isoflavones + Paclitaxel, page 261. Note that paclitaxel isused intravenously, and the effect of biochanin A on intravenous paclitaxel does not appear to have been evaluated. Kudzu + Theophylline No data for kudzu found. For the possibility that high doses of daidzein present in kudzu might modestly increase the major active constituents of the inner bark, the most important of which is lapachol , with deoxylapachol and - and -lapachone and others. Flavo- noids and natural coumarins are also present. Other constituents that may contribute to the pharmaco- logical activity of lapacho include: hole and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol.Use and indications Lapacho is used traditionally for infectious diseases of bacterial, protozoal, fungal and viral origin, to enhance theimmune system, and as an anti-inflammatory agent. It is alsoused as an anticancer therapy, especially in South America, and, although there is experimental evidence to support some of these uses, good clinical evidence is not available.Lapachol is toxic in high doses. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview Lapachol is reported to have anticoagulant properties, whichmay be additive with those of conventional anticoagulants. L 270Lapacho + Anticoagulants Lapacho may have anticoagulant effects and therefore, theor- etically, concurrent use of conventional anticoagulants may beadditive. Clinical evidence No interactions data found. However, it has been stated that lapachol (the main active constituent of lapacho) was originally withdrawnfrom clinical study because of its anticoagulant adverse effects, 1but the original data do not appear to be available. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study in ratliver microsomes found that lapachol is a potent inhibitor of vitamin K epoxide reductase. These effects were said to be similar to those of warfarin.1 Mechanism Anticoagulants such as warfarin exert their effects by antagonising the effects of vitamin K, which is necessary to produce some clotting factors. They do this by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase,which reduces the synthesis of vitamin K. This action appears to beshared by lapachol, and therefore the concurrent use of lapacho andanticoagulants may be additive.Importance and management Evidence is extremely limited, but the fact that lapachol was withdrawn from clinical studies due to its anticoagulant effects addsweight to the theoretical mechanism. Until more is known it wouldseem prudent to discuss the possible increase in anticoagulant effects with any patient taking an anticoagulant, who also wishes to take lapacho. If concurrent use is considered desirable it may be prudentto refer the patient to have their INR, or other suitable clottingparameters, checked. 1. Preusch PC, Suttie JW.

Persian Turkish is Glycyrrhiza L var Liquorice Dry Extract for Flavouring Purposes ( BP 2009 ); Liquorice Liquid Extract ( BP 2009 ); Liquorice Root ( Ph Eur 6.4 ); Liquorice Root for use in THM ( BP 2009 ( USP BP 2009 ); Standardised Liquorice Ethanolic Liquid Extract ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents Liquorice has a great number of active compounds of different classes that act in different ways. The mostimportant constituents are usually considered to be the oleanane-type triterpenes, mainly glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic orglycyrrhizinic acid ), is usually standardised, and its aglycone glycyrrhetinic acid. There are also numer-ous phenolics and flavonoids of the chalcone and isoflavone many natural coumarins such as liqcoumarin, umbelliferone, glabrocoumarones A and B, It also contains polysaccharides such as glycyr- rhizan GA, and a small amount of volatile oil. Use and indications The dried root and stolons of liquorice are used as anexpectorant, antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory, and to treat peptic and duodenal ulcers. Liquorice is widely used intraditional oriental systems of medicine, and as a flavouring ingredient in food. It has mineralocorticoid and oestrogenicactivity in large doses, as a result of glycyrrhetinic acid, and has many other reputed pharmacological effects. Pharmacokinetics Prolonged intake of high doses of liquorice or itsconstituent glycyrrhizin, on probe cytochrome P450 iso-enzyme was investigated 1With liquorice extract and glycyrrhizin signifi-cantly induced hepatic CYP3A and to a lesser extent,CYP1A2. In a single-dose study in 2 healthy subjects, plasma levels of glycyrrhetic acid were much lower after administration ofaqueous liquorice root extract 21 g (containing 1600 mgglycyrrhizin) than after the same 1600-mg dose of pureglycyrrhizin. This suggests that the biological activity of a given dose of glycyrrhizin might be greater if taken as the pure form than as liquorice. This confirmed data from astudy in rats. 2Note that much of the evidence relating to possible interactions is for pure constituents. These findings therefore suggest that the effect of liquorice might be less than that of pure glycyrrhizin at the same dose. Interactions overview Liquorice appears to diminish the effects of antihyperten- sives and may have additive effects on potassium depletion if given in large quantities with laxatives and corticosteroids.Iron absorption may be decreased by liquorice, whereasantibacterials may diminish the effects of liquorice. A case report describes raised digoxin levels and toxicity in a patient taking liquorice. Although it has been suggested thatliquorice may enhance the effects of warfarin, there appearsto be no evidence to support this. Note that liquorice is a constituent of a number of Chinese herbal medicines. See under bupleurum, page 89, for possible interactions ofliquorice given as part of these preparations. 1.

L 272Liquorice + Antihypertensives Liquorice may cause fluid retention and therefore reduce the effects of antihypertensives. Additive hypokalaemia may alsooccur with loop and thiazide diuretics. Clinical evidence In 11 patients with treated hypertension, liquorice 100 g daily for 4 weeks (equivalent to glycyrrhetinic acid 150 mg daily) increased mean blood pressure by 15.3/9.3 mmHg. Smaller rises (3.5/ 3.6 mmHg) were seen in 25 normotensive subjects taking the samedose of liquorice. 1In another study in healthy subjects liquorice 50 to 200 mg daily for 2 to 4 weeks (equivalent to glycyrrhetinic acid 75to 540 mg daily) increased systolic blood pressure by 3.1 to14.4 mmHg. The group taking the largest quantity of liquoriceexperienced the greatest rise in systolic blood pressure, and was theonly group to have a statistically significant rise in diastolic blood pressure. 2 There are many published case reports of serious hypertension occurring in people consuming, often, but not always, excessive doses of liquorice from various sources (confectionery, alcoholicdrinks, flavoured chewing tobacco, herbal teas, herbal medicines). Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence, experimental data have not been cited. There is an extensive literature, which has beenthe subject of a review. 3 Mechanism Ingestion of liquorice inhibits 11 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, thereby preventing the inactivation of cortisol to cortisone.3,4 This results in mineralocorticoid effects including sodium and water retention (leading to hypertension) and hypokalaemia.3This effect would oppose the effects of drugs used to lower blood pressure. Inaddition, the potassium-depleting effect of liquorice would beexpected to be with loop and thiazide diuretics. Themineralocorticoid effect of liquorice is due to the content ofglycyrrhetinic acid (a metabolite of glycyrrhizic acid), and therefore deglycyrrhizinated liquorice would not have this effect. Importance and management The ability of liquorice to increase blood pressure is well established. The dose required to produce this effect might varybetween individuals, and the evidence from the study cited suggeststhat patients with hypertension might be more sensitive to its effect. It is probably not appropriate for patients taking antihypertensive drugs to be treated with liquorice, especially if their hypertension isnot well controlled. Although liquorice-containing confectionaryand other foodstuffs have also been implicated in this interaction it isusually when it has been consumed to excess. It seems unlikely thatthe occasional consumption of small amounts of these products willcause a notable effect. Nevertheless, in patients with poorlycontrolled blood pressure it may be prudent to ask about liquorice consumption to establish whether this could be a factor. Note also that the potassium-depleting effect of liquorice would be additive with that of diuretics such loop diuretics and thiazides. Deglycyrrhizinated liquorice would not beexpected to have effects. 1. Sigurjonsdottir HA, Manhem K, Axelson M, Wallerstedt S.

Liquorice + Carbamazepine For mention that sho-saiko-to (of which liquorice is one of 7constituents) did not affect the metabolism of carbamazepine in an animal study, see Bupleurum + Carbamazepine, page 90. Liquorice + Corticosteroids Liquorice, if given in large quantities with corticosteroids, may cause additive hypokalaemia. Clinical evidence (a) Dexamethasone In a parallel group study, 6 patients were given glycyrrhizin 225 mg daily for 7 days, and 6 patients were given the same dose of glycyrrhizin and dexamethasone 1.5 mg daily for 7 days. The mineralocorticoid effects of glycyrrhizin were significantly reduced by dexamethasone; cortisol plasma concentrations and urinary excretions were reduced by up to 70%.1 (b) Hydrocortisone Glycyrrhizin slightly increased the AUC of cortisol by 13.6% in 4 patients with adrenocorticol insufficiency taking oral hydrocortisone20 to 40 mg daily. Note that glycyrrhizin had no effect onendogenous cortisol levels in 7 control subjects without adrenal insufficiency. 2 In a study in 23 healthy subjects, topical glycyrrhetinic acid markedly potentiated the activity of topical hydrocortisone, as assessed by cutaneous vasoconstrictor effect.3 (c) Prednisolone A study in 6 healthy subjects found that, after taking four 50-mg oral doses of glycyrrhizin at 8-hourly intervals, followed by a bolus injection of prednisolone hemisuccinate 96 micrograms/kg, the AUC of total prednisolone was increased by 50% and the AUC of freeprednisolone was increased by 55%. 4This confirms previous findings in which the glycyrrhizin 200 mg was given by intravenousinfusion. 5 Glycyrrhizin slightly increased the AUC of prednisolone by about 16 to 20% in 12 patients who had been taking oral prednisolone 10 to 30 mg daily for at least 3 months.2 Experimental evidence Several experimental studies have found that glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid (from liquorice) inhibit the conversion of the inactive steroid cortisone 11 -hydroxysteroid Mechanism Inhibition of 11 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase by glycyrrhetinic acid may slightly delay the clearance of hydrocortisone and prednisolone and thereby enhance their effects. However, note that whether a mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid is a substrate for thisLiquorice 273 Lenzyme system depends on its chemical structure. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that liquorice will inhibit the inactivation of allcorticosteroids. Dexamethasone appears to attenuate the suppression). Other would similarly if given in adrenal-suppressant doses. Deglycyrrhizinated liquorice would not have these effects. Importance and management The clinical importance of these observations is uncertain. Doses of corticosteroids sufficient to cause adrenal suppression would be expected to reduce the mineralocorticoid activity of liquorice, butmineralocorticoid activity might still occur. activeconstituent of liquorice) and its metabolite glycyrrhetinic acidslightly the levels hydrocortisone andprednisolone and markedly potentiated the cutaneous effects ofhydrocortisone. This suggests that liquorice will slightly potentiate the effects of these steroids. However, this might not apply to other corticosteroids (see Mechanism, above). Nevertheless, it might beprudent to monitor the concurrent use of liquorice and corticoster-oids, especially if liquorice ingestion is prolonged or if large dosesare taken, as additive effects on water and sodium retention andpotassium depletion may occur. 1.

Licorice glycosides An isolated case of digoxin toxicity has been reported in an elderly patient attributed to the use of a herbal laxative containing kanzo (liquorice). Clinical evidence An 84-year-old man taking digoxin 125 micrograms daily and furosemide 80 mg daily complained of loss of appetite, fatigue andoedema of the lower extremities 5 days after starting to take aChinese herbal laxative containing liquorice (kanzo) 400 mg and rhubarb (daio) 1.6 g three times daily. He was found to have a raised digoxin level of 2.9 nanograms/mL (previous level 1 nanogram/mL)with a pulse rate of 30 bpm, and a slightly low potassium level(2.9 mmol/L). 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The reason for the increase in digoxin levels is unclear. Digoxin inhibits the sodium -potassium ATPase pump, which is concerned with the transport of sodium and potassium ions across themembranes of the myocardial cells. Potassium loss caused by acombination of the liquorice, rhubarb and diuretics exacerbated thepotassium loss from the myocardial cells, thereby enhancing the bradycardia, already caused by an elevated digoxin level. Hypoka- laemia also promotes the binding of digoxin to myocardial cells. Thepatient 's pre-existing cardiovascular disease may have also predis- posed the patient to enhanced digoxin effects. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to one case. It is likely that the effects of the elevated digoxin levels were exacerbated by the hypokalaemiapossibly caused by the herbal laxative. The theoretical basis for aninteraction between liquorice and digoxin is well established, butthere are few actual cases. Any herbal preparation that can reducepotassium levels would be expected to increase the risk of digoxintoxicity. This is likely to be additive with other concurrent medications that a patient may also be taking that can cause hypokalaemia, such as loop diuretics. It would be prudent to exercisecaution in patients who are taking digitalis glycosides and whoregularly use/abuse laxatives including liquorice and/or anthraqui-none-containing substances such as rhubarb. However, note that, ifthese laxatives are used as recommended (at a dose producing acomfortable soft-formed motion), then this interaction is probably unlikely to be important. 1.

Liquorice + Iron compounds The interaction between liquorice and iron compounds is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Liquorice extract 5 g/100 mL slightly enhanced the absorption index of iron by about 44% in rats.1 Mechanism Unknown. It may be related to the content of iron and vitamin C (which promotes iron absorption) in the liquorice extract. Importance and management The experimental evidence suggests that liquorice might slightly enhance the bioavailability of medicinal iron, but further study is needed to assess the clinical relevance of this. At present, no actionis considered necessary. 1. El-Shobaki FA, Saleh ZA, Saleh N. The effect of some beverage extracts on intestinal iron absorption. Z Ernahrungswiss (1990) 29, 264 -9.274 Liquorice LLiquorice + Laxatives Liquorice may cause additive hypokalaemia if given in large quantities with laxatives. Evidence and mechanism (a) Additive potassium depletion Liquorice root may cause water retention and potassium depletion. Chronic diarrhoea caused by the long-term use or abuse of stimulantlaxatives such as aloes and senna may lead to excessive loss of waterand potassium, and can also lead to potassium deficiency. Theor-etically, concurrent use of these herbs might have additive effects on potassium loss. Although the increased potential for potassium deficiency on combined use is mentioned in some reviews, 1there appear to be few clinical reports of this having occurred. Moreover,laxatives containing both senna and liquorice are available in somecountries. One report describes four cases of pseudohyperaldoster-onism (hypertension, hypokalaemia and suppression of the renin - aldosterone axis) in patients taking liquorice-containing laxatives for chronic constipation. In three of the patients, the preparation had been prepared by a herbalist and the fourth patient was taking aproprietary preparation containing senna and liquorice (Midro ). The liquorice doses were high, varying from 0.5 to 8 g daily. Patients hadthe liquorice laxative withdrawn and replaced by glycerine supposi-tories or lactulose, and received spironolactone 200 mg daily for2 weeks to correct blood pressure and potassium. Two months later,the patients had no signs or symptoms of hyperaldosteronism. 2It is not possible to say what contribution senna made to these cases, asthe effects seen could be attributed to liquorice alone. Note that asimilar combination laxative of liquorice with rhubarb caused mild hypokalaemia and digoxin toxicity, see Liquorice + Digoxin,page 274. (b) Reduced absorption of liquorice The introduction to an animal study briefly reported that, in a study in healthy subjects, the AUC and maximum levels of glycyrrhetic acid were much lower after oral administration of Onpito, a Kampomedicine composed of five herbs including liquorice and rhubarb , than after other Kampo medicines containing liquorice and notcontaining rhubarb .3In a series of experiments in rats, the AUC of glycyrrhetic acid, a major component of liquorice, was reduced byup to about 70% by sennoside A, an anthraquinone derivative foundin rhubarb .3The authors propose that competitive inhibition of the anthraquinones on glycyrrhetic acid transportation by monocar-boxylic acid transporter (MCT1) and induction of P-glycoprotein inthe intestinal tract may be possible mechanisms for reducing theabsorption of glycyrrhetic acid. 3 In a study in rats, the AUC and maximum level of glycyrrhetic acid were reduced by 80% and 85% respectively, when a single doseof shaoyao-gancao-tang was given 5 hours after a single dose of sodium picosulfate .4However, it was found that the reduction in glycyrrhetic acid levels seen with the laxative could be markedlyattenuated by the repeated administration of shaoyao-gancao-tang. 4 It was suggested that sodium picosulfate could reduce the metabolism of the glycoside glycyrrhizin to its active metabolite glycyrrhetic acid.4Note that shaoyao-gancao-tang is a traditional Chinese medicine containing liquorice (gancao), of which glycyr- rhizin is a major constituent. Importance and management The possible additive potassium depletion in patients given liquorice and anthraquinone-containing laxatives (such as senna and rhubarb)is a theoretical interaction, but bear it in mind in patients who aretaking liquorice and who are regular users/abusers of anthraquinone-containing substances. However, note that, if anthraquinone laxa-tives are used as recommended (at a dose producing a comfortablesoft-formed motion), this interaction is unlikely to be important. It is unclear if sodium picosulfate affects the efficacy of liquorice as a laxative, and combination products are common.1. Hadley SK, Petry JJ. Medicinal herbs: A primer for primary care.

Liquorice + Ulcer-healing drugs The interaction between liquorice and ulcer-healing drugs isbased on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats, a single oral dose of shaoyao-gancao-tang was given alone and on the last day of a number of different drugs given twice daily for 7 doses. Pretreatment with amoxicillin with metronidazole orclarithromycin with metronidazole markedly glycyrrhetic acid by about 90%. Hyoscine or omeprazole had no effect on the AUC of glycyrrhetic acid. Cimetidine decreased the AUC of glycyrrhetic acid by 42%, but this was not statistically significant.1However, in a further study, it was found that the reduction in glycyrrhetic acid levels seen with theantibacterials could be markedly attenuated by the repetitive administration of shaoyao-gancao-tang. 2 Mechanism It was suggested that amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole decimate intestinal bacteria and so reduce the hydrolysis of theglycoside glycyrrhizin to glycyrrhetic acid, which is the formabsorbed. 1Note that shaoyao-gancao-tang is a traditional Chinese medicine containing liquorice (gancao), of which glycyrrhizin is a major constituent. Importance and management There appear to be no clinical data regarding an interaction between liquorice and ulcer-healing drugs. The findings of the single-doseexperimental study suggested that the clinical efficacy of shaoyao-gancao-tang in peptic ulcer disease might be reduced by theconcurrent use of antibacterials used to eliminate Helicobacter pylori infection. However, the multiple-dose study suggests that, with repeated doses of the herbal medicine, the interaction might notbe clinically relevant. 1. He J-X, Akao T, Nishino T, Tani T.

Liquorice + Warfarin The interaction between liquorice and warfarin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats, pretreatment with gancao aqueous extract 900 mg/kg daily by gastric lavage for 6 days reduced the AUC of a single 2-mg/kg dose of intravenous warfarin by about 38% andincreased its clearance by 57%. 1 Mechanism The authors of the study in ratssuggest that gancao increases themetabolism of warfarin by the activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), which increases the expression of cytochrome P450subfamily CYP3A, and isoenzyme CYP2C9. 1 Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to one experimental study in rats.I t has been hypothesised that liquorice (gancao) might increase the effect of warfarin because of its natural coumarin content,2but the coumarin constituents of liquorice are not known to be antic-oagulants, and there is no evidence of liquorice acting as ananticoagulant. Furthermore, liquorice is not known as a food substance that reduces the activity of warfarin anticoagulation, nor is it known to induce the metabolism of other drugs; however, theexperimental study introduces the possibility that it might. Theevidence presented is too slim to make any specific recommenda-tions regarding concurrent use. 1.

Am J Lycium linoleic acid, and various vitamins amino acids. The root bark contains beta-sitosterol and betaine among other con- stituents. Use and indications Lycium (dried berries or root bark) has been used to treatdiabetes, ophthalmic disorders, hypertension and erectile dysfunction, and is thought to possess anti-inflammatory,antioxidant and anticancer properties. The dried berries are also used as a foodstuff.Pharmacokinetics In vitro studies suggest that lycium may be a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, although this is considered insufficient to cause a drug interaction,1see warfarin, page 278. Interactions overview Lycium has antidiabetic effects, which may be additive toconventional antidiabetics, although evidence for this is largely experimental. A case report suggests that lycium may enhance the effects of warfarin, but this does not appear to beas a result of inhibiting CYP2C9, as has been suggested bysome sources. 1. Lam AY , Elmer GW, Mohutsky interaction The interaction between lycium and antidiabetics is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In an experimental study in ratswith streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes,1Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (extracted from the fruit of lycium) decreased insulin resistance, and reduced fasting insulin and postprandial glucose levels. In another study, a fruit extract ofLycium barbarum 10 mg/kg twice daily for 10 days significantly reduced blood-glucose levels in diabetic rabbits but did not reduce blood-glucose levels in healthy mice. 2 Mechanism Lycium appears to improve glucose transport and increase insulin signalling thereby reducing blood-glucose levels. In theory, theseeffects may be additive with conventional antidiabetics. Importance and management The evidence is limited and purely experimental but what there is suggests that lycium may have antidiabetic properties. This is supported by the traditional use of lycium, in diabetes. Therefore, there is a theoretical possibility that lycium may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effects of conventional antidiabetics. However,until more is known, it would be unwise to advise anything otherthan general caution. 1. Zhao R, Li Q, Xiao B.

Note that lycium berries are used as afoodstuff. Lycium + Herbal medicines No interactions found.Lycium + Warfarin A case report suggests that lycium may enhance the effects ofwarfarin. Clinical evidence A 61-year-old Chinese woman stabilised on warfarin (INR normally 2 to 3) had an unexpected rise in her INR to 4.1, which wasidentified during a routine monthly check. No bleeding was seen.She was also taking atenolol, benazepril, digoxin and fluvastatin. Itwas found that 4 days before visiting the clinic she had started totake one glass (about 170 mL) 3 or 4 times daily of a Chinese herbaltea made from the fruits of lycium to treat blurred vision caused by asore eye. When the herbal treatment was stopped, her INRs rapidly returned to normal. 1 Experimental evidence See under Mechanism, below. Mechanism Warfarin is metabolised by a number of isoenzymes, the most important being CYP2C9. Inhibition of this isoenzyme maytherefore lead to increased warfarin levels and effects. The authors also carried out an in vitro study and concluded that, although lycium is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, this is insufficient to cause an interaction. However, theynote that other mechanisms cannot be ruled out. 1 Importance and management Although the authors suggest avoiding the concurrent use of lycium and warfarin,1because of the many other factors influencing anticoagulant control, it is not possible to reliably ascribe a changein INR specifically to a drug interaction in a single case reportwithout other supporting evidence. It may be better to advise patientsto discuss the use of any herbal products that they wish to try, and to increase monitoring if this is thought advisable. Cases of uneventful use should be reported, as they are as useful as possible cases ofadverse effects. It should be noted that lycium berries are also usedas an ingredient in Chinese foods. 1. Lam AY , Elmer GW, Mohutsky M. Possible interaction containing lycopene 32 ). Use and indications Lycopene is a carotenoid -a natural red pigment found in plants including some fruit and vegetables (such as toma- toes) -and is therefore eaten as part of a healthy diet, and is also used as a food colouring. It has been used for age-related macular degeneration and its antioxidant properties have been investigated for possible use in cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention, especially prostate cancer. Pharmacokinetics Lycopene is similar to betacarotene, the most widely studiedcarotenoid, but, unlike betacarotene, it is not a precursor tovitamin A. A study in 25 healthy men found that the amountof lycopene absorbed from a single dose of up to 120 mg wasless than 6 mg in 80% of subjects, regardless of dose. 1 Interactions overview There is very little information on the interactions of lycopene supplements, but there is some information on dietary lycopene. Combined use with sucrose polyesters,colestyramine, probucol or betacarotene modestly reducesdietary lycopene absorption. Lycopene does not appear to affect the absorption of betacarotene. A low-fat diet does not alter dietary lycopene absorption when dietary intake is high.Colchicine and orlistat modestly reduce the absorption of therelated carotenoid, betacarotene, probably because of their effects on fat absorption. If the mechanism is correct, lycopene levels could also be affected, see Betacarotene +Colchicine, page 63 and Betacarotene + Orlistat, page 64. Diwadkar-Navsariwala V, Novotny DM, JA, M, Bowen PE. A physiological pharmacokinetic model describing the disposition of lycopene in healthy men. J Lipid Res (2003) 44, 1927 -39. L 279Lycopene + Colchicine Colchicine modestly reduces the absorption of the related carot- enoid, betacarotene, potentially because of its effects on fatabsorption. Because lycopene levels tended to be lower in thosetaking low-fat diets (see food, below), if the mechanism is correct,lycopene levels may also be affected by colchicine, see Betacarotene+ Colchicine, page 63. Lycopene + Food A low-fat diet is unlikely to alter the absorption of lycopenewhen the dietary intake of lycopene is high. Clinical evidence There do not appear to be any studies on the effect of food on the absorption of lycopene from supplements; however, there are studieson the effect of foods on absorption of dietary lycopene. In one crossover study in 13 healthy men eating a diet with a controlledcarotenoid content and high in lycopene, there was no significantdifference in the serum levels of lycopene between a high-fatmonounsaturated-fat-enriched diet, or a high-carbohydrate low-fatdiet. Lycopene was consumed as 300 g tomato soup and 60 g oftomato paste every day for 14 days. 1Similarly, no change in serum lycopene levels or betacarotene levels were found in a 12-monthstudy in women randomised to a control diet or a low-fat diet, although plasma lycopene levels tended to be lower in those on the low-fat diet. 2 Experimental evidence In an experimental study in rats fed a diet including lycopene 250 mg/kg for 3 weeks, food restriction of 20% significantly increased the accumulation of lycopene in the liver by about 70%and reduced the serum lycopene levels by about 90%. 3 Mechanism Carotenoids are transported in plasma in lipoprotein cholesterol. The study in humans indicates that in situations of abundant lycopeneintake, the fat content of the diet does not affect absorption. In asituation of food restriction, the distribution of carotenoids is alsorestricted because the circulating total lipid concentrations arereduced, thus resulting in a reduction in the serum levels and accumulation in the liver. Importance and management The available data suggest that diet, especially dietary fat, is unlikely to alter the absorption of lycopene when the dietary intake oflycopene is high. This might therefore apply to lycopene supple-ments, but further study is needed to confirm the absence of an effect of food on their absorption. 1. Ahuja KDK, Ashton EL, Ball MJ.

Lycopene + medicines; Betacarotene The absorption of endogenous lycopene and lycopene given as a supplement may be altered by betacarotene supplementation. The absorption of betacarotene appears to be unaffected.Clinical evidence In a study in 10 healthy subjects, a single 60-mg dose of betacarotene given with a single 60-mg dose of lycopene appearedto significantly increase the AUC of lycopene by about fourfoldwhen compared with lycopene given alone. Betacarotene levels remained the same when given alone and when given with lycopene. However, it was unclear whether absorption was complete by the24-hour time point, and there was large variation in the absorption ofthe carotenoids between subjects in this study. 1 In contrast, in a study in 5 healthy subjects (not taking any lycopene supplements), very high-dose betacarotene 300 mg dailyfor 21 days decreased the levels of endogenous lycopene by about 30%. 2 Experimental evidence In a study in ferrets , although the serum levels of betacarotene following a single 10-mg/kg dose were reduced by a single 10-mg/kg dose of lycopene, the average reduction was notsignificant. 3 Mechanism Unclear. There is some debate as to whether these two carotenoids share the same biochemical pathways and compete for absorption, orwhether the chemical nature of the preparations in which thesupplements are taken affects absorption kinetics. Importance and management The evidence is limited, but it suggests that absorption of betacarotene from supplements is affected only modestly, if at all, by lycopene supplements, whereas betacarotene supplements mightincrease absorption of lycopene supplements taken at the same time.However, the clinical relevance of this, if any, is uncertain. Note thatthe doses of betacarotene used in the studies are much higher thanthe maximum daily dose of supplements of 7 mg recommended bythe Food Standards Agency in the UK. 4 1.

Lycopene + Lipid regulating and probucol reduce the serum levels of lycopeneeaten as part of a normal diet. Clinical evidence There do not appear to be any studies on the effect of lipid regulating drugs on the absorption of lycopene from supplements; however,one 3-year study of 303 hypercholesterolaemic subjects given colestyramine in doses of 8 g to 16 g daily, according to tolerance, found that the serum levels of dietary -derived lycopene were reduced by about 30% after 2 months. When probucol 500 mg twice daily was then added, the serum levels of lycopene were reduced byanother 30% after a further 2 months. After the initial 6-month period, patients were randomised to receive probucol or placebo, and all continued to take colestyramine . In those patients randomised to the placebo group, it took about 1 year for the lycopene levels to return to the pre- probucol level and, in those randomised to probucol , lycopene levels remained at the same low level and did not drop further.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found.280 Lycopene LMechanism Colestyramine and probucol are lipid regulating drugs that reduce the levels of low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol and high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol respectively. Colestyramine also reduces theintestinal absorption of lipids and the authors suggest that probucol may also displace lycopene from very-low-density-lipoprotein- cholesterol in the liver. All these factors may contribute to thereduction of lycopene serum levels because lycopene is fat solubleand therefore its absorption and distribution are dependent on thepresence of lipoproteins. Importance and management This long-term study suggests that colestyramine and probucol reduce the serum levels of lycopene eaten as part of a normal diet.Supplemental lycopene does not appear to have been studied, but beaware that its desired effect may be reduced by colestyramine andprobucol. 1. Elinder LS, H\u00e5dell K, Johansson I, Olsson AG, reduces the absorption of the related carotenoid, betacarotene, probably because of its effects on fat absorption.Because lycopene levels tended to be lower in those taking low-fatdiets (see food, page 280) they may also be affected by orlistat, seeBetacarotene + Orlistat, page 64. Lycopene reduces the serum levels of lycopene eaten as part of a normal diet.Clinical evidence There do not appear to be any studies on the effect of sucrose polyesters on the absorption of lycopene from supplements;however, in one study in 194 healthy subjects, the serum levels ofdietary lycopene were reduced by up to about 30% by Olestra 18 g daily. Olestra is a sucrose polyester that is a non-absorbable, non- calorific fat ingredient in snack foods.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Olestra is thought to reduce the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins when present at the same time in the gastrointestinal tract. Importance and management Evidence is limited to data on dietary lycopene and it is not known whether Olestra or other sucrose polyesters will reduce the absorption of supplemental lycopene; however, it has been foundthat the baseline levels of vitamin A have been maintained when subjects take vitamin A supplements with Olestra , and theoretically, at least, this may also be the case with lycopene.1The manufacturers ofOlestra state that, because snacking is just a part of the normal balanced diet and because there is a lack of scientific agreement onthe health benefits of carotenoids, it is not necessary to takecarotenoid supplements with Olestra . 2It should also be pointed out that the intake of Olestra in this study is far higher than the average daily intake from snack foods. Nevertheless, separating the intake oflycopene and sucrose polyesters should be enough to avoid anypossible interaction. 1.

Use and indications Meadowsweet is used as an anti-inflammatory and antacid.Surprisingly for a herb containing salicylates, meadowsweet is used traditionally to treat stomach complaints, and anti-ulcer activity has been demonstrated in some animal studies. Extracts from the flowers have been reported to have bacteriostatic activity in vitro. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview No interactions with meadowsweet have been found. Note, however, that it contains salicylates, although it is unknown whether the salicylates are at sufficient levels to haveantiplatelet effects and thereby interact with warfarin.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management No evidence found. However, note that meadowsweet contains salicylates, and conventional salicylate drugs increase the risk ofbleeding with anticoagulants such as warfarin , and may have additive effects with antiplatelet drugs, because of their antiplatelet effects.

Use and indications Melatonin is a hormone that is produced in the pineal gland of the brain and influences the circadian rhythm. Supple- ments are therefore principally used for treating sleepdisturbances and disorders such as jet lag, insomnia, sleepwalking, and shift-work sleep disorder. It is also believed to have anticancer and antihypertensive properties, and has been used to treat cluster headaches. Melatonin has also beendetected in a large number of plant species, including thoseused as foods. Concentrations detected have been very variable, the reasons for which are currently uncertain. In addition, the importance of dietary melatonin is unclear. Pharmacokinetics When an oral melatonin supplement 3 mg was given to 17healthy subjects the AUC and maximum serum levels ofmelatonin were than overnight endogenous melatonin secretion, although there was a wide variation between individuals. 1 The oral bioavailability was approximately 15% after oraldoses of 2 or 4 mg, possibly due to significant first-pass metabolism. The half-life has been found to be about 1 hour. 2 Melatonin has been found to be extensively metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in has been supported by in vivo studies, see fluvoxamine, page 288 and caffeine, page 286. In vitro , melatonin had no inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, CYP2D6,CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and a modest inhibitory effect on CYP1A2.3,4 Interactions overview Fluvoxamine markedly increases melatonin levels andincreases its effects (drowsiness). Similarly, combined oralcontraceptives modestly increase melatonin levels, and other oestrogens are predicted to interact similarly. Other drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 are predicted to similarly interact withmelatonin. These include some quinolone antibacterials suchas ciprofloxacin, the oral psoralens and, to a lesser extent, cimetidine. Caffeine also modestly increases melatonin levels. Increased cognitive impairment or similar has beenseen when melatonin was used with zolpidem, imipramineand thioridazine, and might be expected with any CNS depressant drug. Alcohol is expected to decrease the efficacy of melatonin on sleep. Tobacco smoking reduces melatoninlevels, and carbamazepine might be expected to have the same effect, but melatonin had no effect on carbamazepine levels. A few cases of increased or decreased effects ofwarfarin have been noted, but the relevance of this isuncertain. Melatonin slightly increased mean 24-hour blood pressure when given to patients taking nifedipine. 1. Kov\u00e1cs J, Brodner W, Kirchlechner Waldhauser F.

M 285Melatonin + Alcohol Alcohol may reduce the effects of melatonin on sleep. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management The manufacturer briefly notes that alcohol reduces the effectiveness of melatonin on sleep, and that it should not be taken withmelatonin. 1Given the known effects of alcohol on sleep, if melatonin is being taken to improve quality of sleep then this issensible advice. 1. Circadin (Melatonin). Lundbeck Ltd. UK Summary of product characteristics, July 2008. Melatonin + Benzodiazepines and related drugs The CNS effects of benzodiazepines and related hypnotics, such as zolpidem, may be additive to those of melatonin. Clinical evidence In a well-controlled single-dose study in 16 healthy subjects aged 55 years and older, giving prolonged-release melatonin 2 mg with zolpidem 10 mg at bedtime enhanced the impairment of cognitive function seen with zolpidem alone at 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose, but not the next morning. Melatonin alone had no effect on cognitivefunction. No pharmacokinetic interaction was found. 1 Experimental evidence In three experiments in hamsters andmice, melatonin at doses of 300 micrograms/kg, 20 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg given intraperitoneally was found to significantly reduce locomotor activity, increase pain thresholds when placed on hot plates and prolong the onset ofseizures when convulsions were induced, respectively. The benzo-diazepine antagonist, flumazenil 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kggiven intraperitoneally, respectively, reduced the activity ofmelatonin back to approximately normal levels. 2 Mechanism The activity of melatonin is thought to involve similar interactions at the GABA ( -amninobutyric acid) receptors in the brain to benzodiazepines. It may therefore enhance the activity of benzodia-zepines and related drugs. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonistand may have blocked the direct effect of the melatonin, thuscausing the GABA activity to fall below the level required to havethe effects seen in the experimental study. Importance and management The evidence available suggests that melatonin might enhance the sedative properties of benzodiazepines and related hypnotics such aszolpidem. Although in the study of zolpidem, the enhanced effectwas not apparent the morning after dosing, it would be wise to beaware that increased drowsiness is a possibility if melatonin is alsogiven, especially with longer-acting hypnotics. 1.

Melatonin + Buspirone For a case report describing anxiety, with episodes of over-sleepingand memory deficits in a woman taking fluoxetine and buspirone with St John' s wort, ginkgo and melatonin, see St John's wort + Buspirone, page 365. Melatonin + Caffeine Caffeine may moderately raise melatonin levels. Clinical evidence A crossover study in 12 healthy subjects found that a single 200-mg dose of caffeine (equivalent to one large or two small cups ofcoffee), taken 1 hour before and 1 and 3 hours after a single 6-mg oral dose of melatonin, increased the average AUC and maximum levels of melatonin by 120% and 137%, respectively, although thehalf-life of melatonin was not significantly affected. The interactionwas less pronounced in smokers (6 subjects) than in non-smokers (6subjects). 1In a similar study, taking caffeine 12 or 24 hours before melatonin did not affect the melatonin levels, although 2 subjectshad raised melatonin levels when caffeine was taken 12 hours, but not 24 hours, before melatonin. 2 In 12 healthy subjects given a single 200-mg dose of caffeine, taken in the evening, endogenous , nocturnal melatonin levels were found to be increased, and the AUC of melatonin was increased by 32%.3 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Caffeine is thought to reduce the metabolism of melatonin by competing for metabolism by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP1A2. Importance and management It appears that caffeine significantly increases the levels of single doses of supplementary melatonin; however, the long-term effects of caffeine and concurrent multiple dosing of melatonin do not appearto have been studied. Melatonin can cause drowsiness when takenon its own, so patients who take melatonin should be advised thatthis effect may be increased (because of increased melatonin levels)if they also take caffeine, including that from beverages. Thisincreased drowsiness may oppose the stimulating effect of caffeine,or alternatively caffeine may diminish the sedating effects of melatonin; the outcome of concurrent use does not appear to have been studied. 1.

Caffeine raises the serum melatonin level in healthy subjects: an indication by cytochrome P450 Carbamazepine Carbamazepine levels are not affected by melatonin. Melatonin levels are predicted to be reduced by carbamazepine. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a placebo-controlled study on the effects of melatonin on antioxidant enzymes, melatonin 6 to 9 mg/kg daily for 14 days wasgiven to children with epilepsy taking carbamazepine monotherapy. Serum levels of carbamazepine and the accumulation of reactive species caused by carbamazepine.1 One manufacturer predicts that carbamazepine may increase the metabolism of melatonin (by induction of the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP1A2), decreasing its levels (magnitude unknown). 2 However, note that carbamazepine is not a particularly potentinducer of this isoenzyme. It appears that carbamazepine dose adjustments are unlikely to be needed when melatonin is taken. Nevertheless, be aware thatmelatonin may be less effective. 1.

Melatonin + Cimetidine Cimetidine slightly increases melatonin levels. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a single-dose controlled study, cimetidine 800 mg increased the plasma concentration of melatonin after a 2-mg oral dose (magnitudenot stated), whereas the plasma levels of cimetidine were unaffected. The pharmacodynamics of melatonin were not affected. 1,2Cimeti- dine is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome CYP1A2 by which melatonin is principally metabolised. Thepharmacokinetic interaction would be unlikely to be clinicallyrelevant. Nevertheless, the manufacturer recommends caution. 1Be aware of a possible interaction if there is an increase in adverseeffects of melatonin (e.g. irritability, dry mouth, dizziness) onconcurrent use. Other H 2-receptor antagonists are unlikely to interact as they are not known to have enzyme-inhibiting effects. 1. Circadin (Melatonin). Lundbeck Ltd.

Melatonin + Imipramine The concurrent use of imipramine and melatonin may lead toincreased CNS effects. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a single-dose controlled study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction between melatonin 2 mg and imipramine 75 mg. How- ever, there was a possible pharmacodynamic interaction, withincreased feelings of tranquillity and difficulty in performing tasks(undefined) when compared with imipramine alone. 1,2Patients should be warned of a possible additive effect. 1.

Melatonin + Nifedipine Melatonin may have some modest effects on blood pressure in patients taking nifedipine. Clinical evidence Forty-seven subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension well controlled on nifedipine GITS 30 mg or 60 mg daily for the past3 months were given melatonin immediate-release capsules 5 mgeach evening for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4 weeks, there was amodest increase in mean 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 6.5 mmHg and 4.9 mmHg, respectively, and an increase in heart rate of 3.9 bpm. However, there was no difference in single-time point 'clinic 'blood pressure (136/85 mmHg versus 138/87 heart While taking melatonin, there was agreater incidence of drowsiness, during the morning, and weakness.One subject dropped out of the study complaining of markedweakness. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Melatonin has been reported to possess blood pressure- lowering properties when used alone and was expected to haveadditive effects to nifedipine. 1 Importance and management Chronic use of melatonin appears to modestly impair the hypotensive effects of nifedipine and increase the blood pressure and heart rates of patients. However, this was only detected on24-hour blood pressure monitoring, and was not apparent with singlemeasures of blood pressure at the clinic. Therefore, the clinicalrelevance of the effect is probably minor. The mechanism is not clear and, until more is known, bear in mind the possibility of an interaction if patients taking calcium-channel blockers haveincreased blood pressure while also taking melatonin supplements. 1. Lusardi P, Piazza E, Fogari R. Cardiovascular effects of melatonin in hypertensive patients well controlled by nifedipine: a 24-hour study. Br Clin Pharmacol (2000) 49, 423-7. Melatonin Oestrogens Oestrogens, from combined hormonal contraceptives, appear toincrease melatonin levels. Clinical evidence In a clinical study, the AUC and maximum level of a single 6-mg dose of melatonin was about 4 times higher in subjects taking a combined oral contraceptive than those not. Melatonin alone did notsignificantly affect alertness in this study, and no reduced alertnesswas noted in those taking oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptivesbeing used by the women included ethinylestradiol with cyproterone acetate, desogestrel, drospirenone or gestodene. There did not appearto be any obvious differences between these contraceptives, but the numbers of women taking each were too small for this to be conclusive. 1Melatonin 287 MExperimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Ethinylestradiol is a moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, by which melatonin is principally metabolised. Importance and management Women taking combined oral contraceptives may have higher levels of melatonin after using supplements. Although in the study citedthis did not decrease alertness, it would be prudent to bear in mindthe possibility of increased drowsiness. One UK manufacturer extends this caution to hormone replacement therapy, 2although it is unclear whether the oestrogens used for HRT will have the same effect as ethinylestradiol. 1.

Lundbeck Ltd. UK Summary of product characteristics, July 2008. Melatonin + Propofol Melatonin slightly reduces the dose of propofol needed for the induction of anaesthesia. Clinical evidence A study in 45 adult patients found that the induction dose of intravenous propofol, as measured by bispectral index and loss of eyelash reflex, was 15% lower in patients who had received a single3- or 5-mg oral dose of melatonin 100 minutes preoperatively,compared with patients who had received placebo. The time torecover from the anaesthetic was not affected by premedication withmelatonin. Propofol was given in an incremental dose fashion in thisstudy so that any difference could be assessed, but is usually givenas a bolus dose. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Melatonin appears to have anxiolytic and sedative effects, which might reduce the required induction dose of propofol. Importance and management This study was conducted to assess the clinical value of using melatonin premedication, which is not an established use. Thereduction in required dose of propofol was small and, on the basis ofthese data, it is unlikely that any untoward effects would be seen inthe situation where a patient who had recently taken a melatoninsupplement was anaesthetised with propofol. 1. Turkistani A, KF, K. Melatonin premedication and the induction dose of Eur J (2007) 24, 399 - 402. Melatonin + Psoralens Psoralens are predicted to increase melatonin levels. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management The manufacturer briefly notes that methoxsalen and5-methoxy- psoralen inhibit the metabolism of melatonin and increase its levels (magnitude not stated).1Note that 5-methoxypsoralen has been shown to increase endogenous melatonin levels (one study is cited as an example2). Psoralens are potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP1A2 by which melatonin is principally metabolised, and the manufacturer recommends caution on concurrent use,1which seems prudent as the adverse effects of melatonin may be increased. Any interaction would apply only to these psoralens used orally, and not when they are used topically. Be aware of a possible interaction ifthere is an increase in adverse effects of melatonin (e.g. irritability,dry mouth, dizziness) in patients also taking psoralens. 1. Circadin (Melatonin). Lundbeck Ltd. UK Summary of product characteristics, July 2008. 2. Souetre E, Salvati E, Belugou JL, Krebs B, melatonin Limited evidence citalopram does not affect melatonin levels, and no effectwould be expected with other SSRIs. Clinical evidence (a) Citalopram In a study in 7 healthy subjects, citalopram 40 mg had no effect on the levels of endogenous melatonin or its excretion from the body. Extrapolating these findings to an instance where melatonin is givenexogenously as a supplement is difficult, but they suggest thatcitalopram does not inhibit melatonin metabolism. 1 (b) Fluvoxamine In a study in 5 healthy subjects, a single 50-mg dose of fluvoxamine taken 3 hours before a single 5-mg oral dose of melatonin markedlyincreased the AUC and maximum levels of melatonin by and12-fold respectively, although the half-life of melatonin was notsignificantly affected. The interaction was more pronounced in theone subject who was of a CYP2D6-poor metaboliser phenotype(meaning that this patient was lacking or deficient in thisisoenzyme). All subjects reported marked drowsiness after melato- nin intake, and this was even more pronounced after fluvoxamine was also given. 2 Similarly, fluvoxamine 75 mg raised the levels of oral melatonin 5 mg by about 20-fold and significantly improved the sleepbehaviour of a 51-year-old insomniac. 3 In another study in 7 healthy subjexcts, fluvoxamine 50 mg doubled the maximum serum levels and excretion of endogenous melatonin and increased the AUC by about threefold.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, which is the principal isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of melatonin.2 Importance and management Fluvoxamine markedly increases the bioavailability of endogenous melatonin and melatonin given as a supplement. However, the long-term effects of fluvoxamine and concurrent multiple dosing ofmelatonin do not appear to have been studied. Be aware thatexcessive drowsiness and related adverse effects may occur on concurrent use. Note that one UK manufacturer advises that the combination should be avoided. 4Other inhibitors of CYP1A2 may interact similarly (although to a lesser extent as fluvoxamine iscurrently the most potent CYP1A2 inhibitor in clinical use). UKmanufacturer specifically mentions the quinolones. 4Of the quino- lones in common usage, ciprofloxacin is an example of a clinically important CYP1A2 inhibitor. Note that this effect would not be expected with other SSRIs, as these are not CYP1A2 inhibitors, and the study looking at the effects288 Melatonin Mof citalopram on endogenous melatonin somewhat supports this suggestion.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a single-dose controlled study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction between thioridazine 50 mg and melatonin 2 mg. How-ever, there was a possible pharmacodynamic interaction, withincreased feelings of 'muzzy-headedness 'when compared with thioridazine alone. 1,2Patients should be warned of a possible additive effect. 1.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in 8 tobacco smokers, the AUC of a single 25-mg dose of melatonin was almost threefold higher when the melatonin wastaken after 7 days of smoking abstinence than when taken whilesmoking. 1Constituents of tobacco smoke are minor to moderate inducers cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, by which melatonin metabolised. The finding of this study suggests that melatonin might not be as effective in smokers. Be aware of this possibility, and consider tryingan increased melatonin dose if it is not effective in a smoker. 1. Ursing C, von Bahr C, Brismar K, R\u00f6jdmark S. Influence of cigarette smoking on melatonin levels in man. Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2005) 61, 197 -201. Melatonin + Warfarin Case reports suggest that melatonin may raise or lower the INRin response to warfarin. Clinical evidence Six case reports of a suspected interaction between melatonin and warfarin have been documented by the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre, and have been briefly summarised in a review of melatonin.1 In three cases, the prothrombin time was increased, with bleeding events in two (nosebleed, eye haemorrhage, bruising) occurring upto 8 days after starting to take melatonin. The other three casesreports describe a prothrombin time decrease. 1 Experimental evidence See Mechanism, below. Mechanism Unknown. Melatonin did not inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9 in vitro ,2and would not therefore be expected to alter warfarin metabolism via this mechanism. Importance and management These appear to be the only reports in the literature of a possible interaction between melatonin and warfarin. They are difficult to interpret, since they include both increased and decreased warfarin effects, and it is possible that they are just idiosyncratic cases.Because of these cases, a study designed to exclude a pharmaco-kinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction would be useful. Until more isknown, bear these cases in mind in the event of an unexpectedchange in coagulation status in patients also taking melatoninsupplements. 1. Herxheimer A, Petrie KKJ.

Constituents The main active constituents of melilot are natural coumarin and its derivatives, melilotin, melilotol, dihydrocoumarin,umbelliferone scopoletin, formed on dryingfrom the glycoside melilotoside. If spoilage and subsequent fermentation occur, some coumarin derivatives can be transformed into the potent anticoagulant dicoumarol(bishydroxycoumarin). Other constituents present are flavo- noids (including quercetin) and a number of saponins.Use and indications Melilot is used mainly to treat inflammation, oedema andcapillary fragility. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data for melilot found. Forinformation on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavo-noids present in melilot, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Two cases describe bleeding and a raised INR in patients taking a tea and using a topical cream containing melilot, but an interaction has not been established. For information onthe interactions of individual flavonoids present in melilot, see under flavonoids, page 186. M 290Melilot + Food No interactions found. Melilot + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Melilot + Warfarin and related drugs The INR of a patient taking acenocoumarol was increased after she used a melilot-containing topical cream, and a woman whohad been drinking large quantities of a herbal tea containingmelilot developed a prolonged prothrombin time. Clinical evidence A 66 year old taking acenocoumarol , levothyroxine and prazepam had an increase in her INR after massaging a proprietary topical cream ( Cyclo 3 ) containing melilot and butcher 's broom on her legs three times daily. On the first occasion her INR rose from about 2 to5.8 after 7 days of use, and on a later occasion it rose to 4.6 after10 days of use. 1In another report, a woman with unexplained abnormal menstrual bleeding was found to have a prothrombin timeof 53 seconds, and laboratory tests showed that her blood clotting factors were abnormally low. When given parenteral vitamin K herprothrombin time rapidly returned to normal (suggesting that she was taking a vitamin K antagonist of some kind). She stronglydenied taking any anticoagulant drugs, but it was eventually discovered that she had been drinking large quantities of a herbal tea containing among other ingredients tonka beans, melilot andsweet woodruff, all of which might contain natural coumarins. 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Melilot is known to contain natural coumarins, although these do not possess the minimum structural requirements requiredfor anticoagulant activity. See Natural coumarins + Warfarin and related drugs, page 301). It seems that fermentation and spoilage of the melilot by mould are necessary for anticoagulant effects to occur. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to these isolated cases, which are not established. Many factors influence anticoagulant control, andtherefore it is not possible to reliably ascribe a change in INRspecifically to a drug interaction in a single case report without othersupporting evidence. It may be better to advise patients to discussthe use of any herbal products that they wish to try, and to increase monitoring if this is thought advisable. Cases of uneventful use should be reported, as they are as useful as possible cases of adverseeffects. 1. Chiffoleau A, Huguenin H, Veyrac ruscus ).Therapie (2001) 56, 321 -7. 2. Hogan RP.

Constituents The mature fruit (seed) of milk thistle contains silymarin , which is standardised to contain not less than 1.5% (Ph Eur 6.4 ), or not less than 2% ( USP 32 )o f silymarin , expressed as silibinin (dried drug). Standardised extracts, containing high levels of silymarin , are often used. Milk thistle fruit also contains various other flavonoids, page 186, such as quercetin, and various sterols. Note that milk thistle leaves do not contain silymarin , and contain the flavonoids, page 186, apigenin and luteolin, and the triterpene, beta-sitosterol. Use and indications Milk thistle is reported to have hepatoprotective properties and is mainly used for liver diseases and jaundice. Traditionally milk thistle was used by nursing mothers forstimulating milk production, as a bitter tonic, demulcent, as an antidepressant and for dyspeptic complaints. Both the fruit and leaves are used as a herbal medicine, but currentlythe fruit is the main target of investigation because itcontains the pharmacologically active silymarin component. Standardised extracts of silymarin are also commonly used. A water-soluble salt of the individual flavonolignan silibininis used intravenously for preventing hepatotoxicity cap mushroom Amanita phalloides . Pharmacokinetics Several studies have investigated the effect of milk thistle extracts on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and drug trans- porters. In some in vitro studies1-7milk thistle or its flavonolignan constituents inhibited CYP3A4. Although some clinical pharmacokinetic studies suggest that milk thistle may raise the levels of some CYP3A4 substrates,several other studies have found no effect on CYP3A4substrates, see midazolam, page 294, and protease inhibitors,page 295. These conflicting findings may be due, in part, tothe dose of milk thistle used. Indeed, some in vitro studies found that the effect of milk thistle on CYP3A4 wassometimes minor or seen only at higher concentrations. 2,4-7 Other in vitro studies have found that milk thistle or its flavonolignan constituents were minor or moderate inhibi-tors of CYP2C9, 3,4,7CYP2C194and CYP2C8,5but the clinical relevance of this seems likely to be limited. It hasbeen suggested that, while in vitro levels of silymarin may cause moderate inhibition of several cytochrome P450isoenzymes, in vivo levels do not reach inhibitory concen- trations and so milk thistle would not be expected to exhibitinhibition at pharmacologically effective concentrations. 5,6,8 Other in vivo andin vitro studies, have found that milk thistle is unlikely to affect the metabolism of drugs that aresubstrates of CYP1A2 4,5,9 (see caffeine, page 294), CYP2E15,9(see chlorzoxazone, page 294) or CYP2D6.4,5,9 In vitro studies have suggested that silymarin may affect P-glycoprotein substrate binding. However, there is noevidence from human pharmacokinetic studies that milk thistle has a clinically important effect on the levels of drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates, see digoxin, page 294. Silymarin has also been found to inhibit several UDP- glucuronosyltransferases in vitro. 1,3These enzymes are involved in phase II glucuronidation, a process that affectsthe metabolism of several drugs (such as irinotecan,paracetamol and zidovudine), and reduced activity couldtheoretically lead to raised drug levels, although the clinical implications of this are, as yet, unclear. Silibinin dihemisuccinate has also been found to inhibit several of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide(OATP) family in vitro, which could theoretically lead to reduced cellular uptake, and therefore raised levels, of drugs that are OATP substrates. 10For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in milk thistle, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview In vitro studies have suggested that milk thistle may interact with a number of drugs by inhibiting their metabolism by various cytochrome P450 isoenzymes or affecting their transport by P-glycoprotein. However, in vivo studies suggest that any such inhibition is unlikely to be clinicallyrelevant. Milk thistle may raise the levels of a hepatotoxic metabolite of pyrazinamide. For information on the inter- actions of individual flavonoids present in milk thistle, seeunder flavonoids, page 186. R, Zhang S, Schiff PL, Strom SC.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study 19 healthy subjects were given milk thistle 300 mg three times daily for 14 days (standardised to silymarin 80%) with a single8-mg oral dose of midazolam on the last day. There was no change in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam , and milk thistle had no effect on the duration of midazolam-induced sleep.1Similarly, in another study in 12 healthy subjects, milk thistle 175 mg (standardised tosilymarins 80%) given twice daily for 28 days had no significanteffects on the metabolism of a single 8-mg dose of midazolam .2 These studies show that the pharmacokinetics of midazolam are not affected by the concurrent use of milk thistle. As midazolam isused as a probe substrate for the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 this study also suggests that milk thistle is unlikely to affect the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of thisisoenzyme. This suggestion is supported by the finding that themetabolism of other known CYP3A4 substrates is not affected bymilk thistle. See also Milk thistle + Protease inhibitors, page 295. 1.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in 12 healthy subjects, milk thistle 175 mg (standardised to silymarins 80%) given twice daily for 28 days had no significant effects on the metabolism of a single 100-mg dose of caffeine.1 This study suggests that the pharmacokinetics of caffeine are not affected by the concurrent use of milk thistle. As caffeine is used as aprobe substrate for the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 thisstudy also suggests that milk thistle is unlikely to affect themetabolism of other drugs that are substrates of this isoenzyme. 1.

As chlorzoxazone is used as a probe substrate for the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1 this study also suggests that milk thistle isunlikely to affect the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates ofthis isoenzyme. 1.

Milk thistle + Digoxin Milk thistle does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Clinical evidence In a study, 16 healthy subjects were given a single 400-microgram dose of digoxin before and on the last day of a 14-day course of a milk thistle extract (standardised to 80% silymarin) 300 mg three times daily. No statistically significant changes in the pharmaco-kinetics of digoxin were found, although there was a trend towards aminor 10% reduction in the AUC of digoxin. 1 Experimental evidence See Mechanism, below. Mechanism In vitro ,2P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, which is the energy source for the active transport of drugs across cell membranes by P- glycoprotein, was inhibited by silymarin, suggesting a directinteraction with P-glycoprotein substrate binding. Digoxin is a P-glycoprotein substrate, and it had been suggested that milk thistlewould therefore affect digoxin pharmacokinetics. Importance and management Direct evidence appears to be limited to one clinical study, which showed that milk thistle does not cause clinically relevant changes indigoxin pharmacokinetics. It would therefore appear that the dose ofdigoxin would not need to be adjusted in patients also given milkthistle. As digoxin is used as a probe substrate for P-glycoproteinthis study also suggests that milk thistle is unlikely to affect the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of this transporter protein. 1.

Milk thistle + Irinotecan Milk thistle does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics ofirinotecan.294 Milk thistle MEvidence, mechanism, importance and management A pharmacokinetic study was undertaken in 6 patients who were being treated with intravenous irinotecan 125 mg/m2once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. Four days before thesecond dose of irinotecan, a 14-day course of 200 mg milk thistle seed extract (containing silymarin 80%) three times daily was started. The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites didnot differ from week 1 (no milk thistle), week 2 (4 days of milkthistle) to week 3 (12 days of milk thistle). 1No dosage alterations would therefore be expected to be needed if milk thistle (standard-ised to silymarin 80%) is given with irinotecan. 1. van Erp NPH, Zhao Guchelaar H-J, on 7800 -6. Milk thistle Silymarin (the active constituent of milk thistle) modestlyreduces metronidazole Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Silymarin ( Silybon ) 140 mg daily was given to 12 healthy subjects for 9 days, with metronidazole 400 mg three times daily on days 7 to 10. Silymarin reduced the AUC of metronidazole and hydroxy-metronidazole (a major active metabolite) by 28% and the maximumserum levels by 29% and 20%, respectively. The authors suggest that silymarin causes these pharmacokinetic changes by inducing P-glycoprotein and the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP3A4, which are involved in the transport andmetabolism of metronidazole. 1But evidence from other interactions suggests that a clinically relevant effect on P-glycoprotein andCYP3A4 is unlikely. See Milk thistle + Benzodiazepines, page 294,and Milk thistle + Protease inhibitors, below. The general import-ance of this interaction is unclear, but a 28% reduction in the AUC ofmetronidazole would not be expected to be of much clinicalsignificance. 1.

Clinical evidence In a study in 16 healthy subjects, silymarin 280 mg was given 10 hours, and 90 minutes, before a 10-mg dose of nifedipine. Silymarin increased the AUC of nifedipine by about 10% and reduced its maximum serum levels by about 30%, but these effectsvaried greatly between subjects. Silymarin did not alter thehaemodynamic effects of nifedipine. 1One capsule of the product used in this study ( Legalon ) contains 173 to 186 mg dry extract from milk thistle fruits, equivalent to silymarin 140 mg calculated assilibinin. Experimental evidence Two in vitro studies found that silymarin flavonolignans moderately inhibited the oxidation of nifedipine 2and related nifedipine derivative, as marker substrates for CYP3A4 activity. Mechanism The maximum serum levels of nifedipine were reduced slightly but the AUC was not, suggesting a delay in nifedipine absorption. Thiscould be due to irregular gastric emptying in the presence ofsilymarin, or an interaction with drug transporters such as OATP.While the experimental evidence suggests an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, this has not been found to be clinically significant (see under benzodiazepines, page 294). Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to these three studies. The clinical study found that milk thistle may modestly delay the absorption ofnifedipine with an apparent high intra-individual variability. How-ever, as there was no considerable change in the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamic effects of nifedipine (blood pressure and heart rate), this is probably not clinically relevant. It would appear that themodest effects found in vitro do not translate in to a clinically relevant effect. 1.

Milk thistle + Protease inhibitors Although some studies have found that milk thistle slightly lowers indinavir levels, it appears that this is a time-dependenteffect rather than a drug interaction, since it also occurred in acontrol group in one study. The balance of evidence suggests that no important pharmacokinetic interaction occurs. In vitro studies suggest that silibinin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir. Clinical evidence Milk thistle 175 mg three daily y , standardised content) for 3 weeks caused a 9% reduction in the AUC of indinavir and a 25% reduction in its trough plasma level after four doses of indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours, but only the value for the trough level reached statistical significance.1 The authors suggested that the effect on the trough level couldrepresent a time-dependent effect of indinavir pharmacokinetics, as the plasma levels without milk thistle were found to be similarlylowered after a washout phase. 1In another similar study, in 10 healthy subjects, milk thistle standardised for silymarin 160 mg (General Nutrition Corp .) three times daily for 13 days and then with indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours for 4 doses did not cause any statistically significant changes in the indinavir pharmacokinetics (6% reduction in AUC and 32% reduction in minimum level).2In yet another similar study, in 8 healthy subjects, milk thistle capsules (standardised for silymarins 456 mg; Kare and Hope Ltd .), three times daily for 28 days, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours for four doses when compared with 6 subjects in a control group not receiving milk thistle extract. Boththe control and indinavir group had a lower indinavir AUC after the second and third time of administration compared with the first, andthis decline was greater in the control group. 3A meta-analysis of these 3 studies showed no effect of milk thistle on indinavir levels.3 Experimental evidence In a series of experiments on human cell lines and rathepatocytes, silibinin, the major active constituent of the silymarin flavonolignan mixture found in milk thistle, was found not to affect thepharmacokinetics of ritonavir .4 Mechanism Based on animal data, milk thistle might be expected to increase indinavir levels by inhibiting its metabolism,1or transport by P-glycoprotein.2However, silibinin was found not to have a significant effect on P-glycoprotein or cytochrome P450 isoenzymeMilk thistle 295 MCYP3A4 activity when given with ritonavir.4The clinical studies found only a minor reduction in indinavir levels, which was attributed to a time-dependent effect. Importance and management The currently available data suggest that milk thistle extract does not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir (and possiblyritonavir), although this is not totally conclusive. The reduction inindinavir levels appears to be just a time-dependent effect rather thanan effect of the milk thistle, but further study is needed with longerexposure to indinavir than just four doses. Evidence appears to be too slim to prohibit concurrent use, but until more is known it may be prudent to give milk thistle cautiously to patients taking indinavir. 1.

Milk thistle + Pyrazinamide The interaction between milk thistle and pyrazinamide is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats,1pyrazinamide and its active metabolite, pyrazinoic acid, were given after either long-term or short-term exposure to silibinin, the major active constituent of the silymarin flavonolignan mixture found in milk thistle. The first group of rats received intravenous silibinin 100 mg/kg for 3 days before an of pyrazinamide 50 mg/kg or pyrazinoic acid30 mg/kg concurrently on the fourth day. The second group receivedintravenous silibinin 30 mg/kg 10 minutes before an intravenousdose 50 mg/kg or pyrazinoic acid 30 mg/kg. Silibinin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pyrazinamide, but increased the AUC of pyrazinoic acid by 3.5-fold in the long- term exposure group and 4-fold in the short-term exposure group. The maximum serum levels of pyrazinoic acid were increased byabout 60% and 70% respectively. Mechanism It is thought that silibinin may inhibit xanthine oxidase, which is involved in pyrazinamide and pyrazinoic acid hydroxylation.Silibinin may also decrease the hepatobiliary excretion of pyrazinoic acid. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to experimental data. While no pharmacokinetic changes were seen when milk thistle was givenwith pyrazinamide, milk thistle appears to increase the levels of theactive metabolite, pyrazinoic acid. So far, this has only been showninrats so determining the clinical relevance of this interaction is difficult. Nevertheless, because of the dose-related hepatotoxicadverse effects associated with pyrazinamide, it would be prudent tobear this possible interaction in mind in case of an unexpectedresponse to treatment. 1.

Milk thistle + Ranitidine Silymarin, a major constituent of milk thistle, does not appear toaffect the pharmackinetics of single-dose ranitidine. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in 12 healthy subjects, silymarin capsules ( Sivylar ) 140 mg three times daily for 7 days did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of a single 150-mg dose of ranitidine. 1No particular precautions would appear to be necessary if patients take milk thistle and ranitidine the oral bioavailability of ranitidine in healthy human volunteers. Drug Metabol Drug Interact (2007) 22, 175 - 85. Milk thistle + Rosuvastatin Silymarin, a major constituent of milk thistle, does not appear toaffect the pharmackinetics of single-dose rosuvastatin. Clinical evidence In a randomised study, 8 healthy subjects were given silymarin (Legalon ) 140 mg three times daily for 5 days. On day 4 they were given a single 10-mg oral dose of rosuvastatin. Silymarin did notsignificantly affect the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin. 1 Experimental evidence Anin vitro study found that silymarin inhibited the uptake of rosuvastatin mediated by the drug transporter proteins OATP1B1 and BCRP.1 Mechanism In vitro study suggests that silymarin may inhibit drug transporter proteins, but this was not shown by any changes in the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in a small clinical study. Importance and management No particular precautions would appear to be necessary if patients decide to take milk thistle and rosuvastatin together. 1. Deng JW, supplement on pharmacokinetics MNatural coumarins Natural coumarins are widespread in herbal medicines and vegetables. There is a misconception that if a plant contains natural coumarins it will have anticoagulant properties, but very specific structural requirements are necessary for this - namely there must be a non-polar carbon substituent at the 3-position of 4-hydroxycoumarin. Moreover, at present, there are no established interactions between warfarin andherbal medicines that have been attributed to the naturalcoumarin content of the herb. Even in the classic case of haemorrhagic death of livestock that led to the discovery of dicoumarol, it was the action of the mould on the naturalcoumarin in the sweet clover (melilot, page 290) that led tothe production of the anticoagulant, so consumption of a spoiled product would seem to be necessary for this specific interaction to occur. This suggests that the occurrence ofnatural coumarins in dietary supplements or herbal medi-cines should not trigger immediate concern as regards interactions with anticoagulants. The information in this family monograph relates to the individual natural coumarins, and the reader is referred back to the herb (and vice versa) where appropriate. Note that, to avoid confusion with the synthetic anticoagulant coumarins, such as warfarin, the term 'natural coumarins 'has been used to describe those that are of plant origin. Types, sources and related compounds Natural coumarins are aromatic lactones and phenylpropa-noids based on 1,2-benzopyrone (coumarin). They usuallyoccur naturally bound to one or more sugar molecules as glycosides rather than as the free aglycone. There are three major classes of natural coumarins based on the structure Some are further derivatised or prenylated,and coumarins in this class are generally harmless. However, some of the substituted 4-hydroxyderivatives have potent anticoagulant properties. The classic examplethat occurs naturally is dicoumarol (bishydroxycoumarin), which can occur in mouldy forage crops when coumarin itself is transformed into dicoumarol by microbial action.This compound has been used therapeutically as and also the causative agent of haemor- rhagic mouldy Melilotus officinalis ) in cattle. See melilot, the coumarin anticoagulants have an additional furan ring attached, and this group can be further dividedinto linear compounds including psoralen, 5-methoxy- psoralen (bergapten) and angelicin and pimpinellin (5,6-dimethox-yangelicin). Some furanocoumarins may have additional substitution (e.g. bergamottin, alloimperatorin) and some occur as dimers, for example the paradisins, whichare found in grapefruit juice. Others are more complex,such as the highly toxic aflatoxin B1, which is produced by microbial contamination of food crops with Aspergillus niger . Furanocoumarins are commonly found in food items. They are mainly present in the two large plant families Rutaceae and Apiaceae, but occur in others. The Rutaceae family includes grapefruit, page 235, and prickly ash, page 326. The Apiaceae family includes aniseed,page 33, asafoetida, page 39, celery, page 123, Chineseangelica, page 129, carrot, parsnip, and many other herbs and spices. Note that the furanocoumarins are thought to be principally responsible for the main drug interactions ofgrapefruit juice, page 235. . Pyranocoumarins: have a fused pyran ring attached, and can be divided into linear or angular.1 There is also a minor class of coumarins, the 4-phenylcoumarins such as mammeisin, which can also be classified as neoflavonoids. Isocoumarins (1,4-benzopyrones) are more commonly known as chromones ; the most important of these is khellin, a compound found in Ammi visnaga which was the basis for the development of the anti-allergic drug cromoglicate and the class III antiarrhythmic amiodarone. Apart from khellin, which is a smooth muscle relaxant with bronchodilatory andvasodilatory effects, little is known of their activities or toxicities. Coumarin (1,2-benzopyrone) itself was initially isolated from the tonka bean, and is found in other herbs such as melilot, page 290, and in many vegetables, fruits, and spices. It has a sweet scent, recognisable as the odour of new-mown hay. Use and indications Natural coumarins have a wide spectrum of activity rangingfrom the beneficial to the highly toxic. Generally, the furanocoumarins are more biologically active than the other types. Unlike the flavonoids, page 186, and isoflavones,page 258, it is not possible to generalise about their group actions, and this also applies to their toxic and drug interaction effects. In addition, coumarin supplements arenot marketed or taken in the way that isoflavone or flavonoid(bioflavonoid) products are. Therefore only the most notableN 297actions of the natural coumarin derivatives will be outlined here. (a) Anticoagulant activity The anticoagulant activity possessed by some naturalcoumarins is not universal and should not be attributed toall of them. In order to have anticoagulant activity, theremust be a nonpolar carbon substituent at the 3-position of 4- hydroxycoumarin. 2,3The best known natural example is dicoumarol (bishydroxycoumarin), which is formed by the action of moulds on coumarin in sweet clover, see melilot,page 290. It functions as a vitamin K antagonist and has been used therapeutically as an anticoagulant, but the antic- oagulant coumarins commonly used clinically are fullysynthetic phenprocoumon,warfarin). (b) Photosensitisation and PUVA Many furanocoumarins cause phototoxicity by sensitisingthe skin to UV light. This can cause hyperpigmentation ofthe skin, and extracts of plants containing these compoundshave been used in traditional medicine to treat vitiligo. This property is also responsible for the allergenicity that is characteristic of some plants in the Apiaceae Rutaceaefamilies, particularly plus UVA) is treatment for certain skin disorderssuch as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, chronic graft-versus- host disease and psoriasis. UVA irradiation can help these conditions and the effect is enhanced by oral treatment withpsoralen and other furanocoumarin derivatives (includingmethoxsalen), which cause photosensitisation. The doses of psoralens used for these treatments (up to 1.2 mg/kg) are very unlikely to be achieved with herbs containingmethoxsalen, and therefore interactions involving the oralpsoralens are probably unlikely to occur with herbs containing these substances. (c) Antioxidant effects The phenolic structure of the natural coumarins means that most will have free radical scavenging and thereforeantioxidant effects. 4,5Many natural coumarins are potent metal-chelating agents and powerful chain-breakingantioxidants. 4However, these properties have, as yet, only been studied experimentally. (d) Anti-inflammatory activity There is experimental evidence from in vitro and animal studies to suggest that various natural coumarins have anti-inflammatory activity. Esculetin, herniarin, scopoletin and scopolin used in Spanish traditional medicineagainst inflammation, 5and scopoletin has been shown to be pharmacologically active,6as has esculin, extracted from the stem bark of Fraxinus ornus.7 Coumarin itself is an anti-inflammatory agent. This has been demonstrated in animal studies where a coumarin- containing extract of Melilotus officinalis was found to have similar anti-inflammatory action to that of hydrocortisone.8 Coumarin has also been used in the treatment of lymph-oedema. 9(e) Chemopreventive and cytotoxic effects Experimental work has suggested that natural coumarins may prevent carcinogenesis, or have cytotoxic effects. Further work is required to confirm whether this is apotential therapeutic use of these substances. 10,11 (f) Miscellaneous effects Insecticidal, antidiabetic, antifungal and larvicidal, activitieshave all been described for natural coumarin derivatives. It has also been suggested that some of the natural coumarins may be reverse transcriptase, protease or integrase inhibitors,and may warrant further investigation for possible use in themanagement of HIV infection. 12 Coumarin has also been used in perfumery, and as a flavour. However, it has been banned as a food additive innumerous countries, or limits have been set on its use, because it is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys. Pharmacokinetics (a) Coumarin Coumarin is completely absorbed after oral administration,and in humans subject to extensive first-pass which is less toxicand also occurs widely in plants. However, in some people, coumarin is much more hepatotoxic than in others, and this is thought to be due to reduced metabolism of coumarin byCYP2A6, and greater dependence on metabolism by CYP3A4 to form the more toxic 3-hydroxycoumarin and intermediates. 9,13 (b) Bergamottin and related metabolised in vivo to 6 \",7\"-dihydroxyberga- mottin. In a study in 12 healthy subjects given single 6-mg or12-mg doses of bergamottin, 8 subjects had measurable levels of bergamottin and 3 had detectable levels of 6\",7\"-dihydroxybergamottin. 14 (c) Effect on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes Furanocoumarins are now recognised as major cytochromeP450 enzyme inhibitors. They are mainly responsible for thecomplex drug interaction profile of grapefruit products, as shown by a study using furanocoumarin-free grapefruit juice (see Natural coumarins + Felodipine, page 300), althoughother constituents contribute to the effect (see pharmacoki- netics , grapefruit, dihydroxybergamottin, geranylcou-marin and paradisin CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 in vitro , 15and paradisin B has also been found to potent inhibitor ofhuman CYP3A4. 16Methoxsalen and 5-methoxypsoralen (bergapten) are inhibitors clinical pharma-cokinetic drug interaction studies oral methoxsalen 1.2 mg/kg has been shown to markedly inhibit CYP1A2 using caffeine and theophylline as probe substrates. 17,18In another study, oral methoxsalen slightly increased ciclos- porin levels.19It is very unlikely that these doses of methoxsalen would be achieved using herbs containing psoralens including methoxsalen. However, the findings arepresented for information.298 Natural coumarins N(d) Effect on P-glycoprotein In vitro data20suggest that some of the furanocoumarins present in grapefruit juice, such as 6 \",7\"-dihydroxyberga- mottin and 6 \",7\"-epoxybergamottin, are able to inhibit P-glycoprotein activity, raising the possibility of interactions between drugs that are substrates of this transporter protein and furanocoumarins, see talinolol, page 301. However, another in vitro study has suggested that 6 \",7\"-dihydroxy- bergamottin does notaffect the function of P-glycoprotein.21 Interactions overview None of the individual natural coumarins is used as a dietarysupplement or herbal medicine on its own, but rather as theherbs that contain it. Any interactions of the herbal medicines containing natural coumarins are covered under the specific herb. Coumarin itself and the psoralens such as methoxsalen are used in conventional medicine. The doses used for these treatments are very unlikely to be achieved by taking herbal medicines containing these substances, and therefore theinteractions of drugs such as methoxsalen are not coveredhere. The drug interaction potential of some of the furanocou- marins is well established, and has been identified byinvestigating the mechanism of the interactions involvinggrapefruit juice, page 235. This monograph does not contain any of the interactions of the synthetic 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives that are usedas anticoagulants, such as warfarin, because these are not natural coumarins. 1.

Clinical evidence A lung transplant recipient taking ciclosporin had large variations in his ciclosporin levels, which ranged between 319 and 761 nano-grams/mL, on discharge from hospital, which were unexplained bychanges in his current medication or ciclosporin dose changes. It was found that, on the days when the ciclosporin levels were increased, the patient had drunk a citrus soft drink ( Sun Drop ) at breakfast. These fluctuations resolved when he stopped drinking the softdrink. 1However, a subsequent pharmacokinetic study in 12 healthy subjects found that neither Sun Drop nor another citrus soft drink, Fresca , had any significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of a single 2.5-mg/kg dose of ciclosporin. Both Sun Drop andFresca were tested, and found to contain the furanocoumarin bergamottin 0.078 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively (note that grapefruit, which isknown to interact with ciclosporin, contains about 5.6 mg/L). Theauthors note that factors such as genetic and disease-relatedvariability in ciclosporin metabolism, as well as changes in the bergamottin content between batches of the drinks, may account for the contrasting results.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The authors of the report of an interaction with a citrus soda drink confirmed with the manufacturers that it contained furanocoumarins,such as bergamottin, which are thought to inhibit the cytochromeP450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, 1,2which is the major isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of ciclosporin. Importance and management The isolated report of an interaction between a citrus soft drink (containing furanocoumarins) and ciclosporin was not confirmed bya subsequent single-dose pharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects 2 and therefore its significance is unclear. The case does highlight theinfluence that diet can have on ciclosporin levels and it should be borne in mind should any unexpected changes in ciclosporin levels occur. 1. Johnston PE, Milstone A.

Natural coumarins + Felodipine Clinical studies demonstrate that bergamottin and otherfuranocoumarins may cause a clinically relevant increase inthe levels of felodipine, but note that other active constituentsalso present in grapefruit juice may interact by additive orsynergistic mechanisms. Clinical evidence In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, the maximum plasma level of felodipine was increased by 33%, 35% and 40% by bergamottin 2, 6 and 12 mg, respectively, and by 86% by grapefruit juice 250 mL containing about 1.7 mg of bergamottin. The AUC 0-12 of felodipine was increased by 37% by bergamottin 12 mg, and by 48% by the grapefruit juice. There was, however, a wide variation between individuals.1In another study, one-quarter strength lime juice, which contained the same concentration of bergamottin as grapefruit juice, had much less effect on the AUC of felodipine thangrapefruit juice (20% increase versus 80% increase). 2A further study in 18 healthy subjects found that furanocoumarin- free grapefruit juice had no consistent effect on the pharmacokineticsof felodipine relative to orange juice, with AUC changes ranging between a decrease of 46% and an increase of 44%. The median increase in the AUC of felodipine was 104% (range 6% to 230%) inthose subjects given grapefruit juice with furanocoumarins present.Furanocoumarins identified the grapefruit juice included 6\"7\"-dihydroxybergamottin ,bergamottin ,bergamottin -like sub- stances and spiro-esters .3 A study in 12 healthy subjects, which investigated the effects of grapefruit juice and fractions of grapefruit juice on the pharmaco- kinetics of felodipine, found that 6\"7\"-dihydroxybergamottin was not one of the main active ingredients. The fraction with the greatest 6\"7\"-dihydroxybergamottin concentration caused a smaller increase in the AUC of felodipine than the fraction with one-third the amount of6\"7\"-dihydroxybergamottin .4 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The furanocoumarins inhibit the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A subfamily in the intestinal wall so that the first-pass metabolism of felodipine is reduced, thereby increasing itsbioavailability and its effects. However, individually, bergamottindoes not cause as great an effect as grapefruit juice. Similarly, 6 \"7\"- dihydroxybergamottin is not as active as grapefruit juice. Importance and management These studies demonstrate that bergamottin and other furanocou- marins may cause a clinically relevant increase in the levels offelodipine, but that other active constituents are also present ingrapefruit juice, which may interact by additive or synergisticmechanisms. Note that the interaction of grapefruit juice and felodipine, page 237 is established and the manufacturers of felodipine 5,6say that it should not be taken with grapefruit juice. Because any interaction between furanocoumarins and felodipine appears to depend upon interactions between the individualfuranocoumarin constituents present, it is difficult to predict whatthe effects of individual herbs may be. The effects of the individual furanocoumarins appear to be modest. 1. Goosen TC, Cilli\u00e9 D, Bailey DG, Yu C, He K, Hollenberg PF, Woster PM, Cohen L, Williams JA, Rheeders M, Dijkstra HP.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In an in vitro study in which human liver microsomes were incubated with bergamottin and with 6\"7\"-dihydroxybergamottin by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 was inhibited by both compounds to a similar extent to ketoconazole, a known CYP3A4 inhibitor. The transport of saquinavir by P-glycoprotein was also, to an extent,inhibited by 6\"7\"-dihydroxybergamottin .1 Note that grapefruit juice, of which these furanocoumarins are a principal constituent, is known to modestly increase saquinavirlevels. It is difficult to extrapolate these findings to the clinical situation, but, if the effect of these furanocoumarins is similar to that ofgrapefruit juice, any interaction with herbal medicines containingthese constituents would be expected to be mild, and of limitedclinical relevance. 1.

Br J Clin Pharmacol (1999) 48, 543 -52. Natural coumarins + Statins The interaction between natural coumarins and statins is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Anin vitro study demonstrated that bergamottin (a furanocoumarin) inhibited the metabolism of simvastatin in human and ratliver microsomes.1Note that grapefruit juice, of which furanocoumarins such as bergamottin are a principal constituent, is known to markedly increase simvastatin levels, which may lead to myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, and avoidance of concurrent use is therefore advised. These experimental studies suggest that bergamottin plays a part in this interaction, and therefore, until more is known, acautious approach would be to advise patients taking simvastatin (or lovastatin , which is similarly metabolised) to avoid taking supple- ments containing bergamottin , particularly in large quantities. If concurrent use is considered desirable, patients should be advised ofthe symptoms of myopathy (muscle pain, cramps, brown urine), andadvised to promptly seek medical attention if they occur. 1.

Eur J Pharm Sci (2003) 18, 31 -5. Natural coumarins + Talinolol The interaction between natural coumarins and talinolol is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In an in vitro study the effects of several furanocoumarins onP-glycoprotein were assessed using talinolol, a probe substrate for P-glycoprotein. Bergamottin did not affect the transport of talinolol, but6\"7\"-dihydroxybergamottin inhibited the P-glycoprotein transport of talinolol 5-fold and 2.5-fold,respectively, when used in similar concentrations to those found ingrapefruit juice. 1Note that grapefruit juice, of which furanocoumar- ins are a principal constituent, has been shown to modestly decreasetalinolol levels without altering its haemodynamic effects. It is difficult to extrapolate these findings to the clinical situation, but, if the effect of these furanocoumarins is similar to that ofgrapefruit juice, any interaction with herbal medicines containing these constituents would be expected to be mild, and of limited clinical relevance. 1. de Castro WV, Mertens-Talcott S, Derendorf H, Butterweck V.

Natural coumarins + Warfarin and related drugs The interaction between natural coumarins and warfarin and related drugs is based on a prediction only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management It has been suggested that herbal medicines containing naturally occurring coumarins might interact with warfarin and other antic-oagulants by causing additive anticoagulant effects. On this basis,some authors have produced lists of plants that might increase theeffect of warfarin solely because they contain natural coumarins. 1 It is known that, to have anticoagulant activity, a coumarin needs to be a 4-hydroxycoumarin with a nonpolar carbon substituent at the3-position. 2,3Natural coumarins differ widely in their structures, as discussed under Types, sources and related compounds, page 297,and many do not meet this structural requirement. Moreover, even ifanticoagulant activity for a natural coumarin was likely to be basedon its structure, it would need to be determined whether it could occur in sufficiently high enough levels in a plant to be expected to be active. 4Also, it would need to be demonstrated that it is absorbed when given orally.4 There are no established interactions between warfarin and herbal medicines that have been shown to be due to the natural coumarincontent of the herb. Even in the classic case of haemorrhagic deathof livestock after eating mouldy hay that led to the discovery ofdicoumarol, it was the action of the mould on the natural coumarin in the sweet clover (melilot, page 290) that led to the production of the anticoagulant, so consumption of a spoiled product would seemto be necessary for this interaction to occur. On this basis, the occurrence of natural coumarins in herbal medicines should not cause immediate concern. 4 1. Heck AM, DeWitt BA, Lukes AL.

Pharmacopoeias Nettle Leaf (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Stinging Nettle (USP 32). Constituents Nettle root triterpenes, oleanolic and ursolic acid, and their derivatives, and a lectin mixture known as Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) are also present. Root extracts may be standardised to its content of beta-sitosterol ,scopoletin and amino acids ( USP to caffeoylmalic acid and chlorogenic acid expressed as chlorogenic acid (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Note that histamine, formic acid,acetylcholine, acetic acid and 5-hydroxytryptamine, which form the 'sting 'when the fresh leaf is touched, are denatured during drying and processing. Use and indications The root is used mainly to treat benign prostatic hyperplasiain men, and difficulties in passing urine. There is somepharmacological evidence to support this use, but clinical evidence is equivocal and further trials are required. Leaf extracts have been used for treating allergies. Whole nettleextracts have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity and may improve symptoms of osteoarthritis. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present innettle, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview No interactions with nettle found. For information on the interactions of individual flavonoids present in nettle, indications Used for many conditions, particularly diarrhoea, gastritisand skin diseases such as psoriasis.Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found for Oregon grape,but see berberine, page 58, for details on this constituent ofOregon grape. Interactions overview No interactions with Oregon grape found. However, for theinteractions of one of its constituents, Constituents All parts of the parsley plant contain similar compounds but possibly in different proportions. The most importantconstituents are the natural coumarins (furanocoumarins luteolin and others. There is also a small amount of volatile oil present, in all parts but especially the seed, containing apiole, myristicin, eugenol, osthole, carotol and others. Use and indications Parsley root and seed are traditionally used as a diuretic,carminative and for arthritis, rheumatism and other inflam-matory disorders. The leaves are used as a culinary herb in foods.Pharmacokinetics A small study in mice reported that a parsley root extract reduced the liver content of cytochrome P450 when compared with control animals. The general significance ofthis is unclear and further study is needed. 1For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present inparsley, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview A single case reports lithium toxicity in a patient who took aherbal diuretic containing parsley, among many otheringredients. A patient taking warfarin had an increase inhis INR when he stopped taking a regular supplement containing various vitamin K-containing plants, including parsley. For information on the interactions of individualflavonoids present in parsley, see under flavonoids,page 186. 1. Jakovljevic V , Raskovic A, Popovic M, Sabo J.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A study in mice found that parsley (extracted from the rhizome and mixed with water and olive oil in a ratio of 4:3:3), given 2 hours before a single 60-mg/kg dose of aminophenazone, potentiated andprolonged the analgesic action of aminophenazone. 1 The authors of this study suggest that it is possible that the parsley extract reduced the metabolism of aminophenazone by cytochromeP450, as the overall content of cytochrome P450 in the livers of themice given parsley was significantly reduced, when compared with the control group. The clinical relevance of this small preliminary study is unclear and further study is needed, particularly as parsley is commonly used in food. 1. Jakovljevic V , Raskovic A, Popovic M, Sabo J.

Parsley + Food No interactions found. Parsley is commonly used in food. Parsley + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Parsley + Lithium A woman developed lithium toxicity after taking a herbal diuretic. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A 26-year-old woman who had been taking lithium 900 mg twice daily for 5 months, with hydroxyzine, lorazepam, propranolol,risperidone and sertraline, came to an emergency nausea, diarrhoea, unsteady gait, tremor, nystagmus and drow-siness, (all symptoms of lithium toxicity). Her lithium level, whichhad previously been stable at 1.1 mmol/L, was found to be4.5 mmol/L. For the past 2 to 3 weeks she had been taking a non-prescription herbal diuretic containing corn to have diuretic actions. The other ingredientswere bromelain, paprika, potassium and vitamin B 6.1 The most likely explanation is that the herbal diuretic caused the lithium toxicity. It is impossible to know which herb or combinationof herbs actually caused the toxicity, or how, but this case once againemphasises that herbal remedies are not risk free just because they are natural. It also underscores the need for patients to avoid self- medication without first seeking informed advice and monitoring ifthey are taking potentially hazardous drugs like lithium. 1.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A study in mice found that parsley (extracted from the rhizome and mixed with water and olive oil in a ratio of 4:3:3), given 2 hours before a single 80-mg/kg dose of paracetamol, potentiated andprolonged the analgesic action of paracetamol to an extent that wasstatistically significant. The authors suggest that it is possible that the parsley extract reduced the metabolism of paracetamol by cytochrome P450, as theoverall content of cytochrome P450 in the livers of the mice given parsley was significantly reduced, when compared with the controlgroup. 1 The clinical relevance of this small preliminary study is unclear and further study is needed, particularly as parsley is commonly used in food. 1.

Experimental evidence, mechanism, importance and management A study in mice found that parsley (extracted from the rhizome and mixed with water and olive oil in a ratio of 4:3:3), given 2 hours before a single 40-mg/kg dose of pentobarbital significantlyextended the sleeping time, when compared with a control groupofanimals who received pentobarbital alone. This effect was not seen when the same parsley extract was given 30 minutes beforepentobarbital. 1 The authors suggest that it is possible that the parsley extract reduced the metabolism of pentobarbital by cytochrome P450, as theoverall content of cytochrome P450 in the livers of the mice given parsley was significantly reduced compared with the control group. The clinical relevance of this small preliminary study is unclear and further study is needed, particularly as parsley is commonly usedin food. 1. Jakovljevic V , Raskovic A, Popovic M, Sabo J.

Parsley + Warfarin and related drugs A man had a rise in his INR after stopping taking a herbal nutritional supplement (Nature 's Life Greens) , which contained a number of plants including parsley. Clinical evidence A 72-year-old man stabilised on warfarin was found to have an INR of 4.43 at a routine clinic visit, which was increased from 3.07 sixweeks previously. The patient had stopped taking a herbal product Nature 's Life Greens that month because he did not have enough money to buy it. He had been taking it for the past 7 years as aParsley 305 Pvitamin supplement because he had previously been instructed to limit his intake of green leafy vegetables. He was eventuallyrestabilised on warfarin and the same nutritional product. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The product label listed 25 vegetables without stating the amounts or concentrations, 1but at least 5 of the listed ingredients are known to contain high levels of vitamin K 1including parsley, green tea leaves, spinach, broccoli, and cabbage. It is therefore likely that thesupplement contained sufficient vitamin to antagonise the effect ofthe warfarin so that when it was stopped warfarin requirements felland, without an appropriate adjustment in dose, this resulted in anincreased INR. Importance and management The interaction of vitamin K 1from vegetables with warfarin is wellestablished. However, the evidence suggests that, in patients with normal vitamin K 1status, in general, clinically relevant changes in coagulation status require large continued changes in intake of vitamin K 1from foods. It is unlikely that the parsley alone caused this effect, and there appear to be no other published cases of parsley reducing the efficacy of warfarin and related anticoagulants. Becauseof the many other factors influencing anticoagulant control, it is notpossible to reliably ascribe a change in INR specifically to a druginteraction in a single case report without other supporting evidence.It may be better to advise patients to discuss the use of any herbalproducts that they wish to try, and to increase monitoring if this is thought advisable. Cases of uneventful use should be reported, as they are as useful as possible cases of adverse effects. Nevertheless, some consider that increased INR monitoring is required in any patient wanting to stop or start any herbal medicineor nutritional supplement. 1. Bransgrove LL.

Note that Passiflora edulis Sims is the source of the edible passion fruit. Pharmacopoeias Passion Flower ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Passion Flower Dry Extract ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The major constituents of passiflora leaf and flower are C-glycosides of flavonoids based on apigenin and luteolin, to which it may be standardised. Other chrysin type (e.g. harman, harmol and others) are minor constituents or may not even be detectable. Other minor constituents include a cyanogenic glycoside gynocardin, and indications Passiflora is used as a sedative, hypnotic and anxiolytic andhas been reported to have antiepileptic and anti-inflamma-tory effects. Some clinical studies in patients appear tosupport the anxiolytic and sedative effects of passiflora, and animal data suggest that some of the flavonoid constituents, chrysin and apigenin, may be responsible for these effects. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present inpassiflora, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview is used for its sedative effects; additive sedation istherefore a theoretical possibility with other drugs with sedative properties, whereas the effects of stimulant drugs may be reduced. For information on the interactions ofindividual flavonoids present in passiflora, see underflavonoids, page Amfetamines The interaction between passiflora and amfetamines is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management A study in ratsreported that a passiflora extract 250 mg/kg reduced the hyperactivity induced by subcutaneous amfetamine by 39%, when compared with a control group who received amfetamine alone. This effect was reduced by 83% when a Piper methysticum (kava) extract 100 mg/kg was also given.1 Although this was a high-dose study in animals , these results appear to be in line with the known sedative effects of passiflora. Bear in mind the possibility of antagonistic effects when passiflora isgiven with stimulants. 1. Capasso A, Sorrentino L.

This was reported as a 53% increase in sleep duration. This effect was greater (92%) when Piper methysticum (kava) extract 100 mg/kg was also given.1 Although this was a high-dose study in animals , these results appear to be in line with the known sedative effects of passiflora.Bear in mind the possibility of additive sedative effects whenpassiflora is taken with other known sedative drugs. 1.

Constituents The active constituents of pelargonium root are not conclu- sively known, although they are thought to be proanthocyan- idin oligomers based on epigallo- and gallocatechin. A unique O-galloyl- C-glucosylflavones, ellagitannins with a (1)C(4) have also oxygenated 8-hydroxy-5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, predominantly The natural coumarins found in Pelargonium sidoides do not possess the structure required for anticoagulantactivity. Use and indications Pelargonium is used in the treatment of acute bronchitis,tonsillitis and upper respiratory tract infections. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview Pelargonium does not appear to affect either the pharmaco-kinetics or the anticoagulant response to warfarin.P 309Pelargonium + Food No interactions found. Pelargonium + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Pelargonium + Warfarin and related drugs The interaction between pelargonium and warfarin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats,1pelargonium 500 mg/kg (alcoholic extract of Pelargonium sidoides root, Umckaloabo ) given for 14 days had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 0.2-mg/kg doseof warfarin given on day 15. In a separate study, the coagulation parameters (thromboplastin time, partial thromboplastin time andthrombin time) of ratsremained unchanged when they were given pelargonium up to 500 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks. Furthermore,coagulation parameters in response to warfarin 0.05 mg/kg did notdiffer when pelargonium 500 mg/kg was also given. 1 Mechanism It has been suggested that the natural coumarins present in pelargonium may affect the anticoagulant response to warfarin. Importance and management Evidence is limited to this one study in rats, but the coumarin constituents of pelargonium have not been found to possess anticoagulant activity (consider also coumarins, page 297). Themanufacturers of a UK product containing Pelargonium sidoides (Kaloba) state that it may theoretically have an effect on coagulation and therefore interact with anticoagulants. 2However, the natural coumarins found in Pelargonium sidoides do not possess the structure required for anticoagulant activity,1,3and the evidence above supports the conclusion that an interaction is unlikely.Therefore, the dose of warfarin does not need adjusting ifPelargonium sidoides extracts are also given. 1.

Constituents The main constituent of pennyroyal is the toxic volatile oil pulegone . Use and indications Traditionally, pennyroyal has been used for dyspepsia, colds, skin eruptions and delayed menstruation, and it is reported tobe an effective antibacterial and antifungal. It is also believedto be carminative, abortifacient and diaphoretic and it has been used as an insect repellent. The oil from pennyroyal (pulegium oil) is toxic to the liver, kidneys and nerves, andits use is generally considered unsafe. Pharmacokinetics The toxic effects of pennyroyal are thought to be principallydue to metabolites of pulegone such as menthofuran. Themetabolism to toxic metabolites and then inactivation has been shown to be subject to cytochrome P450 isoenzyme- mediated metabolism. 1-5Preclinical experiments are incon- clusive as to which isoenzyme is principally involved. One study using human isoenzymes found that CYP2E1 is the main metaboliser of with CYP2A6 also contrib-uting to some extent. 2In contrast, a study in mice found that CYP1A2 is the major metabolising enzyme with CYP2E1playing a lesser role. 3 Note that peppermint, page 320, contains only small amounts of pulegone. Interactions overview Pennyroyal may reduce the absorption of iron compounds. 1. Mizutani T, Nomura H, Nakanishi K, Fujita S.

Pennyroyal + Iron compounds Pennyroyal tea reduces iron absorption similarly to conventional tea. Clinical evidence In a study in 9 healthy subjects, a 275 mL serving of pennyroyal tea reduced the absorption of iron in a 50 g bread roll by about 70%. Thetea was prepared by adding 300 mL of boiling water to 3 g of theherbal tea, then infusing for 10 minutes before straining and serving.In this study, the inhibitory effect of pennyroyal tea on iron absorption was modestly less than that of black tea (Assam tea, Camellia sinensis L.), which is known to inhibit iron absorption. 1 Consider also, Tea + Iron compounds, page 386. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The polyphenols in pennyroyal may bind to iron in the intestine and influence its absorption. Importance and management The clinical impact of this interaction is not fully known, but be aware that some herbal teas such as pennyroyal reduce ironabsorption similarly to conventional tea, which is not generallyconsidered to be a suitable drink for babies and children, because ofits effects on iron absorption. Furthermore, the safety of pennyroyaltea is not established, and there are concerns about the toxicity of its major volatile oil, pulegone. 1. Hurrell RF, Reddy M, Cook JD. Inhibition of non-haem iron absorption in man by polyphenolic-containing Br J Nutr (1999) Piper nigrum L. (Piperaceae) Synonym(s) and related species Black and white pepper are derived from the fruits of the same species, Piper nigrum L. Black pepper is the unripe fruit which has been immersed in hot water and dried in thesun, during which the outer pericarp shrinks and darkens into a thin, wrinkled black layer. White pepper consists of the seed only, prepared by soaking the fully ripe berries,removing the pericarp and drying the naked seed. Long pepper, Piper longum L., is a closely related species where the fruits are smaller and occur embedded inflower 'spikes ', which form the seed heads. Constituents Alkaloids and alkylamides, the most pipernonaline, lignans and minor constituents such as thepiperoleins, have been isolated from the fruits of bothspecies of pepper. Black pepper and long pepper also containa volatile oil which may differ in constitution, but is composed of bisabolene, sabinene and many others; white pepper contains very little. The pungent taste of pepper isprincipally due to piperine , which acts at the vanilloid receptor. Use and indications Pepper is one of the most popular spices in the world, and itis also used as a folk medicine in many countries. It is usedas a stimulant and carminative, and is reputed to haveanti-asthmatic, anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective and hypocholesterolaemic effects. Most of the pharmaco- logical effects reported to date are attributed to piperine. Ablack pepper extract containing 95% piperine is used in anumber of herbal supplements. Both long pepper and black pepper are important ingre- dients of many Ayurvedic herbal medicines where they areintended to enhance absorption of other medicines, for example in the traditional formula known as Trikatu , which contains Piper nigrum ,Piper longum andZingiber officinale (ginger, page 204) in a ratio of 1:1:1. There is increasing evidence to support this rationale as well as some of the other traditional uses, but it should be noted that the actions ofTrikatu are not always the same as for pepper extracts or pure piperine, and Trikatu has been implicated in reducing rather than enhancing bioavailability of some drugs. Trikatu is also used as a digestive aid. Pharmacokinetics Piperine, given to mice has been shown to delay gastro- intestinal transit time in a dose-dependent manner.1,2A non-significant trend towards a delay in gastrointestinaltransit has also been seen in a study in 14 healthy fastingsubjects given 1.5 g black pepper. 3This has been suggested as one way that piperine might increase the absorption ofdrugs, but its clinical significance is unclear, as pepper isnormally ingested as part of a meal. It has been known for some time that pepper, and piperine in particular, inhibit cytochrome P450, 4,5but it is only more recently that activity against specific human isoenzymes hasbeen tested. Piperine has been found to inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, see verapamil, page 319, in vitro. The bisalkaloids, dipiperamides D and E have also been shown in vitro to inhibit this isoenzyme using nifedipine as a probe substrate. 6Similarly, methanolic and ethanolic extracts of Piper nigrum fruit inhibited CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 in vitro using erythromycin and dextromethorphan as probe substrates, although only theactivity of the methanolic extract against CYP3A4 had a low IC 50value.7These findings have also been published elsewhere.8Piperine did not alter CYP2C, see verapamil, page 319. In vitro studies suggest that piperine may inhibit P-glycoprotein, see digoxin, page 315, and ciclosporin, page 315. It has also been suggested, using data from in vitro studies using guinea-pig cell cultures,9andin vivo studies in rats5 that piperine may inhibit glucuronidation via the UDP-glucuronyltransferase enzyme system, which is involved inthe metabolism of a number of drugs. Interactions overview Piperine, the active alkaloidal constituent of pepper, mark- edly increased the AUC of a single dose of nevirapine and of theophylline when given at a dose that might easily beachieved with piperine-containing supplements. Some cau-tion might be appropriate with these combinations. The AUC of a single dose of propranolol was similarly increased, but this is less likely to be clinically important. Increases inphenytoin levels have also been demonstrated, and high- dose piperine also increased the AUC of rifampicin. Various animal studies have shown increased levels of amoxicillin, barbiturates, NSAIDs and oxytetracycline with piperine, but little effect on cefadroxil. Piperine also had an antithyroid effect in animals . In other animal studies, Trikatu decreased diclofenac and isoniazid levels. 1. Izzo AA, Capasso R, Pinto L, Di Carlo G, Mascolo N, Capasso F.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a single-dose study in rats, pre-treatment with increasing doses of oral piperine from 10 to 50 mg/kg increased the pentobarbital sleeping time (up to twofold). Blood levels of pentobarbital were raised (by 38% at 45 minutes). Piperine at a lower dose of 5 mg/kg had no significant effect on the pentobarbital sleeping time. When the study was repeated after pre-treatment with phenobarbital 100 mg/kg for 7 days, the pentobarbital sleeping time was still prolonged after administration of piperine , but the length of sleeping time was much less than without barbiturate pretreatment.1 Mechanism It was suggested that the increase in sleeping time induced by pentobarbital and phenobarbital was a result of inhibition of drugmetabolising enzymes by piperine. 1 Importance and management This preclinical study provides some limited evidence that piperine, the main active constituent of pepper, might increase the effects ofpentobarbital and possibly also phenobarbital. While it is notpossible to directly apply these data to the clinical situation, it shouldbe noted that the doses used are probably unlikely to be ingestedfrom pepper itself, or from piperine-containing supplements. pentobarbitone induced hypnosis in rats.

Pepper + Beta-lactam antibacterials The interaction or lack of interaction between piperine andamoxicillin, cefadroxil or cefotaxime is based on experimentalevidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence (a) Amoxicillin In a single-dose study in rats, giving piperine 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg followed 30 minutes later by oral amoxicillin 100 mg/kg signifi- cantly increased the maximum amoxicillin plasma by90% 124%, respectively, and the AUC by 66% and 107%,respectively. The time to reach maximum levels was reduced, andthe half-life increased. 1 (b) Cefadroxil In a single-dose study in rats, giving piperine 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg followed 30 minutes later by oral cefadroxil 100 mg/kg had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of cefadroxil.1 (c) Cefotaxime In a single-dose study in rats, giving piperine 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg followed 30 minutes later by intraperitoneal cefotaxime 10 mg/kg significantly increased the maximum cefotaxime by and 71%, respectively, and the half-life by 44% and 65%, respectively.1Mechanism Unknown. The increase in elimination half-life of amoxicillin and cefotaxime suggests a mechanism affecting drug clearance, and not amechanism of increased gastrointestinal absorption. Although theauthors suggest that an effect on drug metabolising enzymes cannot be ruled out, this is unlikely as none of these antibacterials undergoes significant metabolism by this route. Importance and management This preclinical study provides some evidence that piperine, the main active constituent of pepper, might increase exposure to someantibacterials. While it is not possible to directly apply these data to the clinical situation, the level of increases seen would not be expected to be clinically important. It should be noted that the dosesused are probably unlikely to be ingested from pepper itself, or frompiperine-containing supplements 1.

Pepper + Ciclosporin The interaction between piperine and ciclosporin is based onexperimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In an in vitro study, the transport of ciclosporin by P-glycoprotein was modestly inhibited in the presence of piperine , in a concentra- tion-dependent manner.1It is difficult to apply the findings of one experimental study to human intake of pepper and a clinical study is needed to assess whether ingestion of pepper or piperine-containingsupplements actually alters ciclosporin levels. Until more is known,bear this finding in mind in the event of unexpected outcomes inpatients taking ciclosporin and piperine-containing supplements. 1. Bhardwaj Klotz U, Gupta SK, Fromm MF.

Pepper + Digoxin The interaction between piperine and digoxin is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence and mechanism In two in vitro studies, piperine inhibited the transport of digoxin by P-glycoprotein in a concentration-dependent manner.1,2In one of these studies, piperine 50 micromol had an effect comparable to verapamil 100 micromol, a known P-glycoprotein inhibitor.2 Importance and managementUnclear. It is difficult to apply this finding to human intake of pepper. The authors of one of the studies suggest that an inhibitoryconcentration of piperine could potentially be achieved in vivo after ingestion of soup containing 1 g black pepper. 1This amount could have the effect of increasing plasma digoxin levels. However, aclinical study is needed to assess whether ingestion of pepper or piperine-containing supplements actually alters digoxin levels. Until more is known, bear this finding in mind in the event of unexpectedPepper 315 Poutcomes in patients taking digoxin and Bhardwaj Glaeser Klotz U, Gupta SK, Fromm MF.

Pepper + Isoniazid The interaction between piperine and isoniazid is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a single-dose study, 1rabbits were given isoniazid 14 mg/kg alone or with Trikatu 500 mg, which contained 10 mg of the active principle piperine .Trikatu was found to significantly reduce the maximum plasma levels and AUC of isoniazid by 35% and 39%, respectively. Trikatu is an Ayurvedic medicine which contains ginger, black pepper and long pepper in a 1:1:1 ratio. Mechanism It has been suggested that Trikatu delays gastric motility, causing retention of the isoniazid in the stomach. Since isoniazid is largelyabsorbed from the intestine, this might explain the decrease inplasma isoniazid concentrations. Importance and management If the findings of the study in animals were also replicated in humans, it would seem possible that ingestion of Trikatu withisoniazid may reduce isoniazid levels to below the required minimum inhibitory concentration. However, the widespread useof pepper in cooking and lack of reports of treatment failure with isoniazid provide some reassurance that an interaction is unlikely. Nevertheless, bear in mind the possibility of an interaction if there isany indication of a lack of isoniazid efficacy in a patient takingTrikatu. 1. Karan RS, Bhargava Garg SK.

Pepper + Nevirapine Piperine markedly increases the AUC of a single dose ofnevirapine in healthy subjects. Clinical evidence In a well-controlled study in 8 healthy subjects who received piperine 20 mg daily for 7 days, with a single 200-mg dose of nevirapine at the same time as the piperine on day 7, the maximum plasma concentration and AUC of nevirapine were markedly increased by about twofold and 2.6-fold, respectively. The estimated elimination half-life of nevirapine was not significantly altered. Inthis single-dose study there was no difference in the incidence ofadverse events. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Uncertain. It was suggested that piperine inhibited the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism ofnevirapine. 1However, since the elimination half-life of nevirapine was unaltered, it is unlikely that hepatic CYP3A4 was affected.Also, inhibition of gastrointestinal CYP3A4 would themarked increase in nevirapine levels seen, because nevirapine is already over 90% bioavailable. On repeated dosing nevirapine induces its own metabolism (hence the need to increase the doseafter 2 weeks), but in this study nevirapine was given as a singledose, so autoinduction would not have played any part. Subjects inthis study were fasting, but food does not affect nevirapinepharmacokinetics. Importance and management This study appears to show that piperine markedly increases the exposure to single-dose nevirapine that might easily be achievedwith piperine-containing supplements or even from consuming blackpepper. However, at present there is no clear explanation for thefinding, and further investigation is clearly warranted. Furthermore,how the findings relate to the use of multiple-dose nevirapine isunknown, especially as nevirapine induces its own metabolism.Although no adverse effects were seen in this small single-dose study in healthy subjects, nevirapine is known to cause a dose- related rash, and to be hepatotoxic. Until more is known, it would beprudent to be cautious with the use of piperine-containing supple-ments in patients taking nevirapine. 1. Kasibhatta R, Naidu MUR.

Pepper + NSAIDs The interaction between piperine and diclofenac, indometacinand oxyphenbutazone is based on experimental evidence only.316 Pepper PClinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence (a) Diclofenac In a single-dose study in rabbits, the AUC of diclofenac 25 mg/kg was markedly reduced by about 80% when given with Trikatu 500 mg/kg. In this study, a suspension of a combination of diclofenac and Trikatu was used. The anti-inflammatory effects of diclofenac 25 mg/kg were also reduced by Trikatu 500 mg/kg when the combination was given to rats.1Trikatu is an Ayurvedic medicine that contains ginger, black pepper and long pepper in a1:1:1 ratio. (b) Indometacin In a single-dose study in rabbits , Trikatu 500 mg/kg modestly increased the maximum plasma levels of indometacin 7 mg/kg by 29%, without affecting the AUC or other pharmacokinetic param- eters.2Trikatu is an Ayurvedic medicine that contains ginger, black pepper and long pepper in a 1:1:1 ratio. (c) Oxyphenbutazone A single-dose study in rats andmice found that giving piperine 10 mg/kg at the same time as oxyphenbutazone 50 mg/kg modestly increased the AUC and maximum plasma levels of oxyphenbuta- zone by 28% and 36%, respectively. The anti-inflammatory activity of oxyphenbutazone in an animal model was increased.3 Mechanism Unknown. It was expected that Trikatu might increase the bioavailability of diclofenac and indometacin. It is possible thatthere was an incompatibility between diclofenac and a constituent ofTrikatu in the single suspension that resulted in the decreased absorption. The increased bioavailability of oxyphenbutazone with piperine was attributed to increased gastric absorption and inhibitionof hepatic metabolism of oxyphenbutazone. 3 Importance and management The relevance of these disparate findings in animal studies to humans is unclear. Both ginger and pepper, which make up the Trikatu herbal formulation, are used extensively as food ingredients, and as there appear to be no reports of an interaction in humans, the clinical impact of the diclofenac and indometacin findings isprobably minor. Similarly, while the modestly increased exposure tooxyphenbutazone with piperine cannot be directly extrapolated tohumans, increased levels of oxyphenbutazone of this magnitude areunlikely to be of much clinical relevance. 1.

Pepper + Oxytetracycline The interaction between long pepper and oxytetracycline isbased on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in hens, giving long pepper, equivalent to piperine 15 mg/kg, for 7 days, increased the AUC of a single 10-mg/kg oral dose of oxytetracycline given on day 8 by 27%. The elimination half-life was also increased by 29%. The rate of absorption ofoxytetracycline was not affected by the pepper. Note thatoxytetracycline levels were determined by microbial assay. 1 Mechanism The authors of the study attributed the increased bioavailability to inhibition of microsomal metabolising enzymes by piperine in thelong pepper. 1 Importance and management This animal study provides some evidence that pepper might increase exposure to oxytetracycline. While it is not possible to directly apply these data to the clinical situation, the level of increases seen would not be expected to be clinically important. 1.

Pepper + Phenytoin Piperine appears to increase the maximum levels and AUC ofphenytoin, although the effect may be less in patients receivinglong-term phenytoin. Clinical evidence Pepper or its active alkaloid piperine have been reported to enhance the oral bioavailability of phenytoin in three clinical studies. In one crossover study, 6 healthy subjects received a single 300-mg dose of phenytoin 30 minutes after a soup with or without black pepper ,1g per 200 mL. The presence of pepper increased the AUC 0-48, AUC 0-and maximum plasma concentration of phenytoin 133% and 13%, respectively, and the elimination half-life was increased from 22.48 to 49.71 hours. The pepper was added to thesoup after preparation, and the piperine content of the soup wasanalysed and found to be 44 mg per 200 mL. 1 In another crossover study, 5 healthy subjects received a single 300-mg dose of phenytoin orally alone, or after pretreatment with piperine 20 mg daily for 7 days. Piperine increased the AUC and maximum plasma level of phenytoin by 50% and 27%, respectively.The rate of absorption of phenytoin was higher when given after piperine .2 In a study in patients with epilepsy taking phenytoin 150 mg twice daily (10 patients) or 200 mg twice daily (10 patients), there was a minor increase in the AUC and maximum plasma concentrations of phenytoin when they were given a single 20-mg dose of piperine with their morning dose of phenytoin. The increase in AUC andmaximum plasma concentrations of phenytoin were about 9% in group, and 17% and 22%, the200-mg phenytoin group, and the elimination half-life wasunchanged. 3 Experimental evidence A study in mice found that the rate and extent of absorption of a single 10-mg oral dose of phenytoin were increased by the concurrent administration of oral piperine 0.6 mg, and the rate of elimination was reduced. Similarly oral piperine reduced the rate of elimination of phenytoin after an intravenous dose.1 Mechanism The increase in bioavailability of phenytoin caused by piperine may be the result of increased gastrointestinal absorption and decreasedelimination. The effects of piperine in patients already takingphenytoin were far less marked than those in the healthy subjectsgiven single doses of phenytoin. This might be because a single doseof piperine was given simultaneously with the phenytoin in the studyin patients, rather than prior to the phenytoin. Alternatively, it could be that, after long-term use of phenytoin, piperine has little effect on the elimination of phenytoin.Pepper 317 PImportance and management The increases in AUC of single-dose phenytoin in the studies in healthy subjects with pretreatment with pepper or piperine would beconsidered clinically relevant. However, more minor, clinicallyirrelevant increases were seen when a single dose of piperine was given simultaneously with a dose of phenytoin in patients on established phenytoin therapy. It is unclear if, had the administrationschedules in the healthy subject studies been used in the patientstudy, a greater effect might have been seen. However, thewidespread use of pepper in cooking and Ayurvedic medicine, andthe lack of any reports of phenytoin toxicity, provide somereassurance that an interaction is unlikely. Nevertheless, bear the possibility of an interaction in mind if a patient who starts taking piperine-containing supplements presents with unexpectedly highphenytoin levels. 1.

Pepper + Propranolol Piperine pretreatment increased the AUC of a single dose ofpropranolol by twofold in a study in healthy subjects. Clinical evidence In a study in 6 healthy subjects who received a single 40-mg dose of propranolol alone, and after taking piperine 20 mg daily for 7 days, the bioavailability of propranolol was significantly increased, with a twofold increase in both the AUC and maximum plasma concen- tration. However, the rate of elimination of propranolol wasunaffected by piperine .1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Piperine is known to increase the absorption of some substances from the gastrointestinal tract, but the exact mechanism is unclear. Importance and management The effect of piperine on propranolol in this study was fairly large, but increases of this level are not usually considered clinicallyrelevant with drugs such as propranolol that have marked variationin levels between individuals, and are titrated to effect. Also, this dose of piperine is easily achievable by the consumption of black pepper in the diet, and there do not appear to be any reports ofinteractions. Moreover, because it involved only a single dose ofpropranolol, its findings might not be replicated in the clinicalsituation. Nevertheless, bear the possibility of an interaction in mindif a patient who starts taking piperine-containing supplementspresents with an unexpected increase in adverse effects ofpropranolol, such as hypotension or and theophylline in healthy volunteers. Eur J Clin Pharmacol (1991) 41, 615 -17. Pepper + Rifampicin (Rifampin) Piperine increased the AUC of rifampicin, but a small dose of Trikatu had no effect.Clinical evidence In a study, 14 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were given a single 450-mg dose of rifampicin alone, repeated 5 days later with a50-mg dose of piperine , extracted from Piper nigrum . The maximum plasma level and AUC of rifampicin were significantly increased by piperine , by 29% and 70%, respectively.1 In contrast, in a single-dose study in 6 healthy subjects, when rifampicin 450 mg was given with a small dose of Trikatu extract 50 mg the maximum level was slightly reduced by 18% and the time to maximum level was slightly delayed, but these changes were notstatistically significant. Trikatu is an Ayurvedic medicine which contains ginger, black pepper and long pepper in a 1:1:1 ratio.2 Although the preparation used was not analysed for piperine content, it is estimated that this could have been about 1 mg in the50 mg of Trikatu , based on findings of other studies. Experimental evidence In a placebo-controlled study in rabbits, a single dose of Trikatu 500 mg/kg was given with rifampicin 24 mg/kg. The rabbits were then given the same dose of Trikatu once daily for 7 days, with a single 24-mg/kg dose of rifampicin on day 7. In the single-dose study, the maximum plasma concentration of rifampicin was reducedby just 15%. The AUC was also reduced to a similar extent, but thiswas not statistically significant. In the multiple-dose study, Trikatu did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of rifampicin. Thequantity of piperine in the Trikatu was estimated to be 1 mg per 50 mg.3 Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management These are conflicting results, which may be caused, in part, by the use of markedly different doses of piperine, as well as the use of theplant extract and pure piperine. The findings are difficult to interpret, but the widespread use of pepper in cooking and lack of reports of interactions with rifampicin give some reassurance that any inter-action is unlikely to be clinically important. 1.

Pepper + Theophylline Piperine almost doubled the AUC of a single dose of theophyl-line. Clinical evidence In a study in 6 healthy subjects who received a single 150-mg dose of theophylline alone, and after taking piperine 20 mg daily for 7 days, the bioavailability of theophylline was significantlyincreased, with an increase in the AUC and maximum plasmaconcentration of 96% and 61%, respectively. The elimination half-life of theophylline was extended from about 6.6 to 10.8 hours. 1 Although not specifically stated, it is assumed that this study used astandard-release theophylline preparation. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Piperine is known to increase the absorption of some substances from the gastrointestinal tract, but the exact mechanism is unclear. However, theophylline already has high oral bioavailability. The finding of an increased elimination half-life suggests a mechanism of318 Pepper Preduced metabolism or clearance. Piperine is known to inhibit some of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, although there do not appear tobe any data specifically on CYP1A2, which is mainly involved in the metabolism of theophylline. Importance and management This study appears to show a marked increase in exposure to single- dose theophylline when given with a dose of piperine that mighteasily be achieved with piperine-containing supplements or evenfrom consuming black pepper. How the findings relate to the use ofmultiple-dose theophylline or sustained-release formulations is also unknown. The widespread use of pepper in cooking and lack of reports of interactions with theophylline gives some reassurance thatany interaction is unlikely to be clinically important. Nevertheless,until more it known, it would be prudent to be cautious with the useof piperine-containing supplements in patients taking and theophylline in healthy volunteers. Eur J Clin Pharmacol (1991) 41, 615 -17. Pepper + Thyroid and Antithyroid drugs The interaction between piperine and thyroid drugs, such as levothyroxine, or antithyroid drugs, such as carbimazole, isbased on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Piperine was evaluated for its thyroid-hormone and glucose- regulatory effects in a study in mice. Oral piperine 2.5 mg/kg daily for 15 days lowered the serum levels of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) as well as glucose concentrations. The decreases were comparable to that of theantithyroid drug, propylthiouracil . A 10-fold lower dose of piperine (0.25 mg/kg) had little effect.1Mechanism Not known. Piperine appears to have antithyroid activity. Importance and management This preclinical study provides some evidence that piperine, the main active constituent of pepper, might have antithyroid effects. Theoretically this may have additive effects with other antithyroiddrugs, such as propylthiouracil or carbimazole , and could antagonise the effects of levothyroxine . It is not possible to directly apply these data to the clinical situation, and how the doses used relate to usualhuman consumption of pepper or the dose of piperine in supple-ments is unclear. Note that there appears to be no evidence of pepper or piperine being a problem in patients with thyroid disorders. This study does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend caution inpatients requiring thyroid supplementation. Bear in mind thepossibility of an interaction in a patient requiring an increase inlevothyroxine dose after starting piperine-containing supplements. 1. Panda S, Kar A. Piperine lowers the serum concentrations of thyroid hormones, glucose and hepatic 5 'D activity in adult male mice. Horm Metab Res (2003) 35, 523 -6. Pepper + Verapamil The interaction between piperine and verapamil is based onexperimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In an in vitro study, the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of verapamil to norverapamil was inhibited by the presence of piperine , but the CYP2C-mediated metabolism of verapamil was not significantly altered by piperine .1It is difficult to apply this finding to human intake of pepper. However, a clinical study is needed to assesswhether ingestion of pepper or piperine -containing supplements actually alters verapamil levels. Until more is known, bear thisfinding in mind in the event of unexpected outcomes in patients taking verapamil and piperine -containing supplements. 1. Bhardwaj U, Gupta SK, Fromm MF.

Use and indications Peppermint leaf and distilled oil have carminative,antispasmodic, diaphoretic and antiseptic properties, andare mainly used to relieve symptoms of indigestion. Peppermint is commonly used as a flavouring ingredient in food, cosmetics and medicines. Pharmacokinetics Peppermint tea was found to inhibit the activity of thecytochrome P450 subfamily CYP2E by up to 40% in a studyinrats pretreated for 4 weeks with the tea. 1In an in vitro study, peppermint oil 20 to 500 micrograms/mL was foundto moderately inhibit the activity of the cytochrome P450isoenzymes CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. 2 Both these studies found that there was no significant inhibition of CYP3A4 by peppermint,1,2but see also calcium-channel blockers, page 321 and ciclosporin,page 321. Peppermint oil does not appear to have any clinically relevant effects on the cytochrome P450 iso- enzyme CYP1A2, see caffeine, page pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present inpeppermint, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Food and antacids may compromise the enteric coating ofsome commercially available peppermint oil capsules.Peppermint oil appears to increase ciclosporin and felodipinelevels and topically, in high doses, it may also enhance the skin penetration of some topical medicines. Peppermint tea contains digoxin-like constituents, but the clinical relevanceof this is unclear. It may also impair iron absorption, and is unlikely to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine.

H 2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors may interact similarly. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management The manufacturers of some enteric-coated peppermint oil prepar- ations advise that indigestion remedies (antacids) should not betaken at the same time as peppermint oil. 1This is presumably because a marked rise in pH caused by antacids might causepremature dissolution of the enteric coating and release of thepeppermint oil in the stomach, which increases the risk of heartburnwith the preparation. Separation of administration by a couple ofhours usually avoids this type of interaction with antacids. Somemonographs extend this advice to H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors and suggest that these drugs should be avoided. 1. Colpermin (Peppermint oil). McNeil Ltd. UK Summary of product characteristics, May 2008. Peppermint + Caffeine Peppermint oil does not appear to affect the metabolism ofcaffeine but might slightly delay its absorption. Clinical evidence In a crossover study in 11 healthy women, a single 100-mg capsule of menthol (a major constituent of peppermint oil) taken withdecaffeinated coffee, to which 200 mg of caffeine had been added,had no effect on caffeine pharmacokinetics except for an increase intime to maximum caffeine concentration of about 30 minutes. Themaximum decrease in heart rate seen with caffeine was less in thepresence of menthol (about 4 bpm difference), but menthol had no effect on the small changes in blood pressure seen with caffeine. 1 Experimental evidence One in vitro2study and one animal study3found that peppermint oil or tea inhibited the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2. Mechanism cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, for which caffeine is a probe substrate; the clinical evidence with menthol (a major constituent ofpeppermint oil) found that caffeine metabolism was not altered.Menthol slightly delayed the absorption of caffeine. Importance and management The clinical evidence suggests that peppermint oil might not have clinically relevant effects on the metabolism of substrates of CYP1A2, which would be in keeping with the fact that no such interactions appear to have been reported. Peppermint oil mightslightly delay the absorption of caffeine, and presumably otherdrugs, but the delay of 30 minutes suggests that this is usuallyunlikely to be clinically relevant. 1.

In vitro experiments suggest that peppermint oil is a moderate inhibitorof nifedipine metabolism. Clinical evidence In a randomised, single-dose study in 12 healthy subjects 1pepper- mint oil capsules 600 mg increased the AUC and maximum serum levels of extended-release felodipine 10 mg by about 55% and 40%, respectively, without affecting the half-life. The AUC maximumserum levels of dehydrofelodipine, the were increased by 37% and 25%, respectively.1 Experimental evidence Peppermint oil and two of its components, menthol and menthyl acetate, were found to be moderate reversible inhibitors of nifedipine metabolism in in vitro investigations in human liver microsomes.1 Mechanism It is thought that menthol may account for a substantial portion of the interactions reported for peppermint oil. Felodipine undergoes atleast two sequential metabolic steps mediated by CYP3A4 and the authors of the clinical study suggest that peppermint may selectively inhibit the secondary step as opposed to the primary step but furtherstudy is needed. 1In contrast, two other in vitro studies found that peppermint did not affect CYP3A4, see Pharmacokinetics, page 320. Importance and management The clinical study suggests that peppermint oil may modestly increase the bioavailability of felodipine, which might therefore increase the incidence of adverse effects such as headache, light- headedness and flushing. Further study is needed, but, until then, itwould be prudent to be aware of this possibility in any patient takingfelodipine if they are given oral peppermint oil. It is possible that notall calcium-channel blockers will be affected, since some, unlikefelodipine, are highly bioavailable. This interaction is similar to thatof grapefruit juice, which affects felodipine and nisoldipine (low oralbioavailability), but only minimally affects amlodipine and diltiazem (high oral bioavailability). The data would be expected to have relevance only to therapeutic doses of oils, and not to herbal teas, or small amounts in foods, where no clinically relevant interaction is anticipated. 1.

Clin Pharmacol Ther (2002) 72, 247 -55. Peppermint + Ciclosporin The interaction between peppermint oil and ciclosporin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a single-dose study in rats, peppermint oil 100 mg/kg mixed with ciclosporin ( Sandimmune formulation) almost tripled the AUC and maximum serum levels of ciclosporin 25 mg/kg.1 In vitro studies also found that peppermint oil 50 micrograms/mL inhibits ciclosporin metabolism in ratliver microsomes by up to 85%.1 MechanismUnclear. The authors rule out P-glycoprotein inhibition as a potentialPeppermint 321 Pmode of action. that inhibition of the cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP3A may have a role, and enhanced gastrointestinalpermeability may also be a factor. Importance and management Although clinical data are lacking, the experimental study demon- strates that peppermint oil significantly enhances the oral bioavail-ability of ciclosporin in rats. Further study is needed to see if a similar effect occurs in humans. Until then, it may be prudent to beaware of the possibility that peppermint oil might increaseciclosporin levels. If patients taking ciclosporin are given pepper- mint oil it may be prudent to monitor ciclosporin levels within a few weeks of starting concurrent use, if this is not already planned. The data would have relevance only to therapeutic doses of oils, and not to herbal teas, or small amounts in foods, which would notbe expected to interact to a clinically relevant extent. 1.

Peppermint + Digitalis glycosides Many herbal medicines contain cardiac glycosides, which couldin theory have additive effects with digoxin or digitoxin, or interfere with their assays. However, there appear to be few such interactions reported. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In an in vitro study, 46 commercially packaged herb teas and 78 teas prepared from herbs were assayed for digoxin-like factors by their cross-reactivity with digoxin antibody, and these values were used togive approximate equivalent daily doses of digoxin. Peppermint was found to contain greater than 30 micrograms of digoxin equivalents per cup and was suggested that this would provide a therapeuticdaily dose of digoxin if 5 cups of peppermint tea a day were drunk. 1 However, note that some common teas sampled in this study (e.g.English Breakfast, Earl Grey) contained over 20 micrograms ofdigoxin equivalents per cup. Given that these teas are commonlyconsumed in the UK and an interaction with digoxin has not beenreported, the interpretation of the findings of this study is unclear. Theoretical interactions with herbal medicines are not always translated into practice. On the basis of this one study, no specialprecautions would be expected to be necessary in patients takingdigoxin who drink peppermint tea. 1. Longerich L, Johnson E, Gault MH. Digoxin-like factors in herbal teas. Clin Invest Med (1993) 16, 210 -18. Peppermint + Food Food may compromise the enteric coating of some commerciallyavailable peppermint oil capsules. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management The manufacturers of some enteric-coated peppermint oil prepar- ations advise that they should not be taken immediately after food. 1,2 This is presumably because presence of food in the stomach willdelay gastric emptying and might cause premature dissolution of theenteric coating and release of the peppermint oil before it reaches theintestine. This may result in adverse effects, such as indigestion. 1. Colpermin (Peppermint oil). McNeil Ltd. UK Summary of product characteristics, May 2008. 2. Mintec (Peppermint oil).

Peppermint + Iron compounds Peppermint tea appears to reduce iron absorption similarly toconventional tea. Clinical evidence In a study in 9 healthy subjects a 275-mL serving of peppermint tea reduced the absorption of iron from a 50-g bread roll by about 85%.The tea was prepared by adding 300 mL of boiling water to 3 g of the herb tea, then infusing for 10 minutes before straining and serving. In this study, the inhibitory effect of peppermint tea on ironabsorption was equivalent to that of black tea (Assam tea, Camellia sinensis L.), which is known to inhibit iron absorption, see Tea + Iron compounds, page 386. 1 Experimental evidence Peppermint leaf tea 2.2 g/kg daily was found to inhibit iron absorption in rats.2Serum iron and ferritin levels were reduced by about 20%. Conversely, a tea prepared from Mentha spicata did not inhibit iron absorption to a significant extent and so the authors suggested that menthol, a major constituent of peppermint, but notMentha spicata , is involved. Mechanism The polyphenols in peppermint tea may bind to iron in the gastrointestinal tract and reduce its absorption. Importance and management The clinical impact of this interaction between peppermint tea and iron is not fully known, but be aware that some herbal teas such aspeppermint reduce iron absorption similarly to conventional tea. SeeTea + Iron compounds, page 386. Note that tea and coffee are not generally considered to be suitable drinks for babies and children, because of their effects on iron absorption. 1.

Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Preliminary in vitro experiments using human skin samples 1have found that low-dose peppermint oil (0.1% and 1%) on the skin surface can significantly reduce the amount of topical benzoic acid penetrating the dermal barrier. Conversely, at higher concentrations (5%), peppermint oil decreased the integrity of the dermal barrier.1In another study, peppermint oil enhanced the fluorouracil permeation across ratskin.2 These experimental studies suggest that topical peppermint oil might increase the absorption of other topical drugs; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to make any clinical recommen-dations. 1.

Constituents Policosanol consists of a mixture of alcohols with octa- cosanol being the major component. Triacontanol and hexacosanol are also present but in lesser amounts. Use and indications Policosanol is isolated from sugar cane wax and, because ofits lipid-lowering and antiplatelet properties, is mainly usedfor cardiovascular disorders. It is also being investigated forpossible use in the treatment of Parkinson' s disease, and for enhancing athletic performance. Pharmacokinetics Policosanol did not alter the metabolism of phenazone(antipyrine) in dogs.1Phenazone is used as a probe drug to assess the effects of other drugs on hepatic enzyme induction and inhibition. This finding therefore suggests that polico- sanol is unlikely to induce or inhibit the metabolism of otherdrugs that are substrates of hepatic enzymes. Interactions overview Policosanol has antiplatelet effects, which may be additive with other antiplatelet drugs, and could theoretically increase the risk of bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants.Policosanol may also enhance the blood pressure-loweringeffects of some antihypertensives. P\u00e9rez-Souto Biol (1991) 22, 77 -8.P 323Policosanol + Anticoagulants The interaction between policosanol and anticoagulants is based on a prediction only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Policosanol 200 mg/kg did not prolong the bleeding time of warfarin 200 micrograms/kg given for 3 days in rats.1 Mechanism, importance and management Although policosanol did not enhance the prolongation of the bleeding time induced by warfarin in rats, policosanol has antiplatelet properties and increased bleeding has been reportedwhen it was given with aspirin, see below, so bear this in mind if excessive bleeding is seen. 1. Carbajal D, Arruzazabala ML, Vald\u00e9s S, M\u00e1s R. Interaction policosanol-warfarin on bleeding time and thrombosis in rats. Pharmacol Res (1998) 38, 89 -91. Policosanol + Antiplatelet drugs Policosanol has antiplatelet effects, which may be additive with those of other antiplatelet drugs. Clinical evidence In a randomised study, four groups, each containing 10 or 11 subjects, were given placebo, policosanol 20 mg daily, aspirin 100 mg daily or both drugs together, for 7 days. Adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation was reduced in the group given aspirin and policosanol by about 35% more than in the group given aspirin alone: the effects of aspirin and policosanol were approximatelyadditive. Furthermore, collagen-induced platelet aggregation wasreduced in the group given aspirin and policosanol by about 10% more than in the group given aspirin alone. One patient taking both drugs suffered from bleeding gums. There was no significant effecton coagulation time. 1A 3-year study, primarily designed to assess the safety and efficacy of policosanol in patients taking betablockers, included 32 patients taking antiplatelet drugs (mainly aspirin ). No adverse effects related to bleeding were reported.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Additive antiplatelet effects. Importance and management The concurrent use of two conventional antiplatelet drugs is not uncommon, and so concurrent use of policosanol and aspirin need not be avoided. However, because platelet aggregation was reduced significantly, and a bleeding event was experienced, caution isperhaps warranted when taking policosanol supplements with aspirinor any other antiplatelet drug. 1.

Int J Clin Pharmacol Res (2004) 24, 65 -77.Policosanol + Beta blockers Policosanol appears to increase the blood pressure-lowering effects of beta blockers. Clinical evidence In a randomised study in patients (aged 60 to 80 years) taking beta blockers, the addition of policosanol 5 mg tablets daily (titrated to adose of 2 to 4 tablets) found that the average blood pressure wasreduced from about 141/83 mmHg to 131/81 mmHg after one year, and 126/79 mmHg after 3 years. The efficacy of policosanol was not reduced and adverse effects were actually slightly lower in thepolicosanol group. 1 Experimental evidence In a study in hypertensive rats, a single 200-mg/kg oral dose of policosanol enhanced the blood pressure-lowering effects of intra- venous and oral propranolol without increasing the reduction in heart rate induced by propranolol .2 Mechanism Policosanol is thought to reduce vascular resistance. Importance and management Policosanol increased the blood pressure-lowering effects of beta blockers and the clinical study suggests that the effect is gradual and beneficial. Furthermore, adverse effects related to hypotension werenot reported. It therefore appears that, as with other conventionalantihypertensives, policosanol may increase the effects of the betablockers and so some caution is warranted, but no adverse effectssuch as first-dose hypotension would be expected. 1.

Policosanol + Phenazone (Antipyrine) The information regarding the use of policosanol with phena- zone (antipyrine) is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence A study in dogs found that the pharmacokinetics of an intravenous dose of phenazone 10 mg/kg were not affected by oral treatment with policosanol, 25 mg/kg daily for 21 days.1 Mechanism No mechanism expected.Importance and managementOn the basis of the results from this animal study, there appears to be no reason to avoid taking policosanol supplements with phenazone. 1. P\u00e9rez-Souto Cenic Biol (1991) 22, 77 -8. Policosanol + Sodium nitroprusside The interaction between policosanol and sodium nitroprusside is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence A study found that the antiplatelet and hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside was greater in rats that had been pre-treated with a single 200-mg/kg oral dose of policosanol, than in animals that had not received policosanol.1 Mechanism Both policosanol and sodium nitroprusside have antiplatelet effects. These appear to be additive. Policosanol reduces vascular resistanceand has been shown to enhance the blood pressure-lowering effectsof other antihypertensives. Importance and management The clinical significance of this finding is unclear, but bear it in mind in case of an unexpected response to treatment. 1.

Constituents The main constituents of prickly ash bark include isoquinoline and asarinin,resins and volatile oil are also present. Use and indications Prickly ash is traditionally used for cramps and Raynaud 's syndrome. The bark is mainly used as an antirheumatic, analgesic and carminative, and is believed to possesscardioprotective effects. It is also used to treat toothache and fevers, and is used as a flavouring agent in food and drink. It is also used as a fish poison. Because of doubts about the toxicity of the alkaloids that it contains (which aresaid to have hypotensive, anti-inflammatory and neuromus- cular blocking activity), some sources do not recommend its use. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview No interactions with prickly ash found.P 326Pumpkin Cucurbita pepo L. (Cucurbitaceae) Synonym(s) pumpkin seeds, Squash. Cucurbita maxima Duchesne and other Cucurbita species. Constituents Pumpkin seeds contain a fixed oil, the predominant fatty acids of which are linoleic, oleic, palmitic and a high sterol content and lathostanolderivatives present, and vitamin E, particularly gamma- tocopherol. The seeds also contain a number of cucurbitacins such as cucurbitin, the type and concentration depending ongrowth and variety.Use and indications Pumpkin seeds are widely used as a foodstuff. Traditionally,they were used to treat tapeworm infection (cucurbitin hasanthelmintic effects), but more recently they have begun tobe more widely used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview No interactions with pumpkin seed found. Note thatpumpkin seeds are widely used as a foodstuff.P 327Pycnogenol Pinus pinaster Aiton pine. Pinus maritima Lam. Note that Pycnogenol is a trademark for the extract from the bark of the French maritime pine which grows in the southern coastal area of France. Constituents Pycnogenol is a standardised water extract of the bark ofFrench maritime pine, containing a range of flavonoid polyphenols and procyanidins, including catechin, and, to a lesser degree, epicatechin. Other constituents are poly-phenolic monomers, which include taxifolin, ferulic acid, benzoic acid and cinnamic acid, and their glycosides. Use and indications Pycnogenol is used for a wide variety of disease states and ispromoted for its antioxidant effects. Clinical studies indicate that it can be effective in the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency, cardiovascular disorders, asthma, vascular retinopathies and inflammatory conditions such as systemiclupus erythematosus. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in pycnogenol, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Pycnogenol only modestly increases the antiplatelet effectsof aspirin. For information on the interactions of individualflavonoids present in pycnogenol, see under flavonoids, page 186.P 328Pycnogenol + Antiplatelet drugs The interaction between pycnogenol and antiplatelet drugs is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study using blood samples from 38 healthy subjects found that pycnogenol dissolved in alcohol-inhibited, ADP-stimu- lated platelet aggregation, but enhanced the plateletinhibition caused by aspirin . Pycnogenol dissolved in water did not affect platelet inhibition caused by aspirin .1 Mechanism Pycnogenol inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2, which, it is suggested, may account for its antiplatelet effects.2 Importance and management Evidence is limited to one experimental study, which suggests that pycnogenol may inhibit platelet aggregation; however, it does notappear to particularly enhance the effects of aspirin. Thereforeconcurrent use seems likely to be safe, although this needsconfirmation in clinical studies. The use of pycnogenol with otherantiplatelet drugs does not appear to have been studied. 1.

(Fabaceae) be confused with melilot, page 290, which is known as sweet clover. Pharmacopoeias Powdered Red Clover ( USP 32 ); ); Red Clover ( USP ); Red Clover Tablets (USP 32). Constituents Red clover flowers contain isoflavones , to which they may be standardised. The major isoflavones are biochanin A and formononetin , with small amounts of genistein and daidzein and their glycoside and coumarin. Use and indications Red clover was traditionally used for skin conditions, suchas eczema and psoriasis. However, the isoflavone fraction is now more commonly used as a form of HRT in women to reduce the symptoms of the menopause, although random-ised controlled studies show only a slight benefit at best. 1,2It is also used for mastalgia, premenstrual syndrome andcancer prevention.Pharmacokinetics In an in vitro study, an extract of red clover reduced the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19,CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The effects on CYP2C8 andCYP2C9 were the most significant. 3Biochanin A, a major component of red clover, can inhibit P-glycoprotein andOATP, see Isoflavones + Digoxin, page 261 and Isoflavones+ Paclitaxel, page 261. For further information on the pharmacokinetics of the specific isoflavones genistein, daidzein and biochanin A, page A is metabolisedto genistein and formononetin to daidzein. 4 Interactions overview It has been suggested that red clover may interact withanticoagulants, but evidence for this is largely lacking.Potential interactions of isoflavone constituents of red clover are covered under isoflavones; see antibacterials, page 260, digoxin, page 261, fexofenadine, page 261, paclitaxel,page 261 and tamoxifen, page 262. 1.

For the theoretical possibility that broad-spectrum antibacterials might reduce the metabolism of theisoflavone constituents of red clover, such as daidzin, by colonicbacteria, and so alter their efficacy, see Isoflavones + Antibacterials,page 260. Red clover + Anticoagulants The interaction between red clover and anticoagulants is basedon a prediction only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Some reviews list red clover as having the potential to increase the risk of bleeding or potentiate the effects of warfarin, 1based on the fact that red clover contains natural coumarins. Although red clovercontains coumarin, it is not itself an active anticoagulant. Withmelilot, page 290, which has a high content of coumarin, the actionof moulds on the herb can result in the formation of an activeanticoagulant, dicoumarol, from the coumarin, and bleeding dis- orders have occurred in animals fed spoiled hay containing melilot. There appears to be no published evidence of haemorrhagicdisorders in animals fed red clover silage or hay. It might be thatthe coumarin content of red clover is too low to be a problem. Notethat mouldy red clover hay has caused poisoning in animals, but thisis because of mycotoxins such as slaframine. However, there is onecase report of spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage in a 53-year-old woman, which was attributed to a herbal supplement containing red clover, and also wild yam, black cohosh, Chinese angelica, raspberry leaf, agnus castus, Siberian ginseng, partridge berry andnettle leaf, which she had been taking for 4 months. 2With case reports, it is not possible to say, conclusively, which, if any, of theseconstituents might have contributed to the adverse effect. However,of the constituents in this preparation, Chinese angelica has beenassociated with bleeding events, see Chinese angelica + Warfarin and related drugs, page 131. Taken together, the evidence suggests that no special precautions are likely to be required when red clover supplements are used with anticoagulants. 1. Heck AM, DeWitt BA, Lukes AL.

For the possibility that biochanin Aand genistein present in red clover might markedly increasepaclitaxel levels, see Isoflavones + Paclitaxel, page 261. Note thatpaclitaxel is used intravenously, and the effect of biochanin A onintravenous paclitaxel does not appear to have been evaluated. Red clover + Tamoxifen No data for red clover found. Data relating to the use of theisoflavone constituents of red clover, such as biochanin A, daidzeinand genistein, with related species Vitis vinifera is the Grape vine, of which there are many cultivars. Red vine leaf is a cultivar with red leaves. Constituents Red vine leaf contains a range of polyphenolics, mainly flavonoids , proanthocyanins and anthocyanins. The quercetin and isoquercitrin. Catechins present include gallocatechin and epigallocatechin and their polymers. The red colour is due to the anthocyanins, which are mainly glucosides of malvidin,but also of delphinidin, and pertunidin. Hydroxy-cinnamic acids (e.g. caffeic acid) and resveratrol are also present. Use and indications Red vine leaf extract is used both internally and externally toimprove blood circulation, particularly in the legs forvaricose veins. There is some clinical evidence to support its use in venous insufficiency. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. See under flavonoids, page 186, for information on the individualflavonoids present in red vine leaf, and see under resveratrol, page 335, for the pharmacokinetics of resveratrol. Interactions overview No interactions with red vine leaf found. For information on the interactions of flavonoids, see under flavonoids,page 186, and for the interactions of resveratrol, see under resveratrol, page 335.R 334Resveratrol Types, sources and related compounds Resveratrol is a polyphenol present in most grape and wine products and is the compound largely credited with provid-ing the health benefits of red wine. However, the concen-tration is very variable between foods and supplements, so it is difficult to evaluate the clinical relevance of the available information. Use and indications Resveratrol is used for its reputed anti-ageing effects. It issaid to have antioxidant properties and antiplatelet effects,and is therefore promoted as having benefits in a variety ofcardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis. It also has some oestrogenic and anti-inflammatory activity, and is under investigation in the prevention and treatment ofcancer, because it appears to reduce cell proliferation. Pharmacokinetics Anin vitro study reported that resveratrol inhibited the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, but was much less potent than erythromycin,1a known, clinically relevant, moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. Similar results were found in other studies.2,3Interestingly, red wine also inhibited CYP3A4, but this effect did not correlate with the resveratrol content.1,4 In other studies resveratrol had only very weak inhibitory effects on CYP1A2, which are unlikely to be of any clinical relevance.3,5,6Similarly, one study3suggests that resveratrol and its primary metabolite do not inhibit CYP2C9 (seeResveratrol + Diclofenac, page 336) and CYP2D6, and resveratrol only weakly inhibits CYP2C19 (see Resveratrol + Mephenytoin, page 336). Interactions overview Resveratrol may have clinically significant antiplatelet effects which may be additive with antiplatelets and anticoagulant drugs as well as other drugs that may cause bleeding such as NSAIDs. An in vitro study reports that resveratrol had no significant effect on the metabolism ofdiclofenac and only weakly inhibited the metabolism of ( S)- mephenytoin. Therefore clinically relevant pharmacokineticinteractions between resveratrol and substrates of CYP2C9and CYP2C19, respectively, would not be expected. An in vitro study also found that resveratrol moderately inhibited the metabolism of paclitaxel; however, the clinical relevanceof this is unclear. 1. Chan WK, Delucchi AB.

Experimental evidence Anex vivo study using samples of platelet-rich plasma from 50 high- risk cardiac patients taking aspirin found that resveratrol signifi- cantly reduced platelet aggregation in response to collagen and adrenaline (epinephrine) in the samples taken from aspirin-resistantpatients, but only had a minimal effect in those taken from aspirin-sensitive patients. Resveratrol had minimal effects on ADP-inducedplatelet aggregation in both groups of patients. 1Another in vitro study found that a low concentration of resveratrol (2 or5 micromoles) increased the inhibitory effect of prostaglandins E 1 and I 2on platelet aggregation in response to collagen, although it did not itself affect collagen-induced platelet aggregation.2This subject has been extensively studied and is the subject of a number ofreview articles. 3,4 Mechanism Resveratrol appears to enhance the inhibitory response to platelet aggregation. This effect may be additive to the effects of other drugs with antiplatelet effects. Importance and management Although there appears to be a plethora of in vitro studies to support the antiplatelet role of resveratrol, there is a lack of clinical data in humans. Therefore it is difficult to confirm if a clinically significantenhancement of antiplatelet effects would occur in patients takingresveratrol with antiplatelet drugs. Concurrent use need not be avoided (indeed combinations of antiplatelet drugs are often prescribed together), but it may be prudent to be aware of thepotential for increased bleeding if resveratrol is given with otherantiplatelet drugs such as aspirin andclopidogrel . Patients should discuss any episode of prolonged bleeding with a healthcareprofessional. Drugs that enhance antiplatelet effects may also increase the risk of bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulants such as warfarin . Clinically, the use of an antiplatelet drug with an anticoagulantshould generally be avoided in the absence of a specific indication.However, if concurrent use is felt desirable it would seem sensible towarn patients to be alert for any signs of bruising or bleeding, andreport these immediately, should they occur. 1.

Resveratrol + Diclofenac The information regarding the use of resveratrol with diclofenacis based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study using human liver microsomes found thatresveratrol had no significant effect on the metabolism of diclofenac. 1 Mechanism Nothing expected. Diclofenac can be used as a probe substrate for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9 activity. Importance and management Evidence is limited to this one in vitro study. Although there are no in vivo data available, it seems unlikely that resveratrol will affect the metabolism of diclofenac and therefore no dosage adjustments are likely to be needed if they are given together. Note that resveratrol may have some antiplatelet effects, which may beadditive with those of NSAIDs such as diclofenac, consider alsoResveratrol + Anticoagulant or Antiplatelet drugs, above. Diclofenaccan be used as a probe drug for CYP2C9 activity, and therefore theseresults also suggest that a pharmacokinetic interaction betweenresveratrol and other CYP2C9 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Resveratrol + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Resveratrol + Mephenytoin The information regarding the use of resveratrol with mephen- ytoin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study using human liver microsomes found that resveratrol only weakly inhibited the metabolism of ( S)-mepheny- toin.1 MechanismNothing expected. Mephenytoin can be probe substrate for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 activity. Importance and management Evidence is limited to this one in vitro study. Although there are no in vivo data available, it seems unlikely that resveratrol will affect the metabolism of mephenytoin and therefore no dosage adjustments are likely to be needed if they are given together. Mephenytoin can be used as a probe drug for CYP2C19 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic interaction betweenresveratrol and other CYP2C19 substrates is unlikely. 1. C, Shin YG, Kosmeder JW, Pezzuto JM, van Breemen RB. Liquid + Paclitaxel The interaction between resveratrol and paclitaxel is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study in human liver microsomes investigated the effects of resveratrol on the metabolism of paclitaxel. In both ratand human microsomes, isoenzymeCYP2C8 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A4. In this study resveratrol appeared to moderately inhibit these isoenzymes. Importance and management The clinical relevance of this study is unknown. Further study is needed to confirm if this inhibition produces a clinically relevantincrease in paclitaxel levels, which could also potentially increasethe adverse effects of paclitaxel. However, the authors alsosuggested that, as the metabolites of paclitaxel are less active thanpaclitaxel itself, inhibiting its metabolism may be beneficial. There iscurrently insufficient evidence on which to base any clinicalrecommendations. 1. V\u00e1clav\u00edkov\u00e1 R, Horsk\u00fd S, imek P, Gut I. Paclitaxel metabolism in rat and human liver microsomes is inhibited by phenolic antioxidants. Naunyn Other Rhodiola species may also used, particularly in Chinese medicine. Constituents The main active constituents of rhodiola rhizome and root are thought to be the rosavins (a complex series of monoterpene alcohol and phenylpropanoid -sitosterol), and octenyl glucosides). There isalso a small amount of essential oil (about 0.05%). Use and indications Rhodiola is widely used throughout the world, and thedifferent species are used for similar purposes. It is considered to be an adaptogen, used for coping with stress, improving mood and alleviating depression. There is a largeamount of pharmacological evidence available in support ofits use and studies have shown that it can improve both physical and mental performance, reduce fatigue and prevent altitude sickness. However the evidence is of variable qualityand the clinical efficacy of rhodiola remains to be conclu- sively demonstrated.Pharmacokinetics Anin vitro study found that root inhibited the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4; the concentra-tions of rosarin. 1The manufacturer2of a licensed rhodiola product reports that in an in vitro study, a rhodiola extract 10 micrograms/mL inhibited CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. How-ever, in another study, an extract of rhodiola did not affectthe metabolism of warfarin, page 339, which is a substrate of CYP2C9. Rhodiola did not affect the metabolism of theophylline, page 339, and therefore seems unlikely toaffect the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates ofCYP1A2. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in rhodiola, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Rhodiola does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics oftheophylline or warfarin. The concurrent use of pepper may diminish the antidepressant effects of rhodiola.

Rhodiola + Herbal medicines; Pepper The interaction between rhodiola and warfarin is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence A study in ratsfound that the addition of piperine , an alkaloid found in pepper, to rhodiola. The maximum plasma concen-tration of rhodioloside was reduced by 22%, and the AUC andmaximum plasma concentration of rosavin were increased by 33%and 82%, respectively. 1 Mechanism The exact constituents of rhodiola that are responsible for antidepressant activity are not fully established. Rhodiolosidealone possesses some antidepressant activity. Although rosavinalone does not appear to be an antidepressant, when given incombination with other rhodiola constituents including rhodiolosidethe antidepressant effects are enhanced. Changes in the pharmaco- kinetics of the constituents of rhodiola by piperine may have diminished its antidepressant activity. The authors suggest that thismay be due to the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP1A1 by piperine. 1 Importance and management Evidence is limited to one experimental study and extrapolating these findings to a clinical setting is difficult. Although the effect of using both of these herbal medicines in humans is unknown, due to the unpredictable effects that may occur when piperine is taken withrhodiola, notably a reduction in antidepressant effects, the authors ofthis study suggest that concurrent use should be avoided. Given thatthe outcome of concurrent use is likely to be opposite to the desiredeffects, this seems a reasonable recommendation. 1.

Rhodiola + Theophylline The interaction between rhodiola and theophylline is based on experimental evidence only.Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study, ratswere given a standardised 0.8%) twice daily for 3 days with a single dose of aminophylline , given one hour after the last dose of rhodiola extract. The pharmacokinetics oftheophylline were only slightly affected by the rhodiola extract (lessthan 15% decrease in AUC and maximum levels). 1 Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management Information appears to be limited to this one study in rats, which may not necessarily extrapolate directly to humans. However, what is known suggests that rhodiola extract is unlikely to have aclinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. 1.

Rhodiola + Warfarin The interaction between rhodiola and warfarin is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study, ratswere given a standardised 0.8%) twice daily for 3 days with a single dose of warfarin, given one hour after the last dose of rhodiola extract. The maximum levels of warfarin were increased by a modest 34%, but the AUC and half-life were notaltered by rhodiola. Furthermore, the anticoagulant effects ofwarfarin (assessed by monitoring PTT) were unaffected. 1 Mechanism Unknown. In other in vitro studies, rhodiola inhibited the activity of the cytochrome metabolises the S-warfarin isomer. See Pharmacokinetics, page 338. Importance and management Information appears to be limited to this one study in rats, which may not necessarily extrapolate directly to humans. However, what is known suggests that rhodiola extract is unlikely to affect theresponse to treatment with warfarin. 1.

Note that Indian rhubarb of the dried root of Rheum emodi Wall. or some other related species of Rheum . Note also that the root of Rheum rhaponticum (English rhubarb, Garden as an adulterant in rhubarb and pharmacopoeias specify a test for its absence. Pharmacopoeias Compound Rhubarb Tincture ( BP 2009 ); Rhubarb ( BP 2009 , Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents Anthraquinone glycosides are major of chrysophanol, emodin, to E. Various tannins, stilbeneglycosides, resins, starch and trace amounts of volatile oil are also present. Indian rhubarb contains similar anthraquinones, but Eng- lish rhubarb contains only chrysophanol and some of its glycosides.Use and indications Rhubarb rhizome and root is used as a laxative, but at lowdoses it is also used to treat diarrhoea, because of the tannincontent. It is also used as a flavouring in food. Pharmacokinetics For information on the pharmacokinetics of an anthraqui- none glycoside present in rhubarb, see under aloes, page 27. Interactions overview A case report describes raised digoxin levels and toxicity in a patient taking a Chinese herbal laxative containing rhubarb(daio), see Liquorice + Digitalis glycosides, page 274 for further details. No further interactions with rhubarb found; however, rhubarb (by virtue of its anthraquinone content) is expected to share some of the interactions of a number of other anthraquinone-containing laxatives, such as aloes, page 27 and senna, page 349. Of particular relevance Red bush tea, Green red bush, Kaffree tea. Constituents The needle-like leaves and stems of rooibos contain polyphenolic flavonoids . The unfermented product remains green in colour and contains aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone, whereas the fermented product is red in colour due tooxidation of the constituent polyphenols. Oxidation of aspalathin produces dihydro-iso-orientin. Other flavonoids present rutin, isoquercetin, hyperoside and quercetin. Rooibos also con-tains volatile oils and minerals, but does not contain caffeine. 1The tannin content of rooibos tea is less than 5%. Use and indications Rooibos teas have been traditionally used in South Africa for a wide range of aliments including asthma, colic, headache,nausea, depression, diabetes and hypertension. 1Currently,rooibos is principally used to produce a tea-like beverage. Inexperimental studies, it has shown some antioxidant, chemopreventive and immunomodulating effects. 1 cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, see midazolam, page 342. For information on thepharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in rooi- bos, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Midazolam levels are reduced by rooibos tea in vitro and in rats, but clinical evidence for an interaction is lacking. Rooibos tea does not appear to affect iron absorption. For information on the interactions of individual flavonoids present in rooibos, see under flavonoids, page 186. 1. McKay DL, Blumberg JB. A review of the bioactivity of South -16.R 341Rooibos + Food No interactions found. Rooibos + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Rooibos + Iron compounds Rooibos tea does not appear to significantly reduce the absorp- tion of iron. Clinical evidence In a parallel group study in healthy subjects, mean iron absorption after ingestion of radiolabelled iron 16 mg with a beverage was7.25% with rooibos tea, 1.7% with tea and 9.34% with water. 1Note that tea is known inhibit iron absorption, see Tea + Iron compounds, page 386. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Rooibos does not appear to reduce the absorption of iron. It contains some polyphenolic flavonoids which might bind iron in the gut; however, these differ from the polyphenols found in tea, such as the catechins, which have reported to affect iron absorption. Tanninsfound in tea are also thought to reduce iron absorption, but rooibostea has less than 5% tannins. Importance and management The evidence suggests that rooibos does not reduce the absorption of iron. No special precautions are likely to be required. 1. Hesseling PB, Klopper JF, van Heerden PD. The effect of rooibos tea on iron absorption. [In Afrikaans] S Afr Med J (1979) 55, 631 -2.Rooibos + Midazolam The interaction between rooibos tea and midazolam is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence Anin vitro study investigating the effects of rooibos tea on midazolam pharmacokinetics found that a 10% solution of rooibos tea 4 g/L brewed for 5 minutes reduced the levels of the 4-hydroxymetabolite of midazolam to undetectable levels. 1A subsequent study inratsfound that an unrestricted amount of rooibos tea given for 2 weeks reduced the AUC and maximum concentration of a single20-mg/kg oral dose of midazolam by 70% and 64%, respectively.Intestinal metabolism appeared to be more affected than hepatic metabolism. 1 Mechanism Midazolam is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. These studies suggest that rooibos tea induces CYP3A4,mainly in the intestine, thereby increasing midazolam metabolismand decreasing its levels. Importance and management Although the data are limited and there appear to be no clinical studies, it would seem that rooibos tea may have the potential tosignificantly reduce the levels of midazolam, and therefore reduce itsefficacy. However, the amount of rooibos tea required to signifi-cantly inhibit CYP3A4 in humans, and produce a clinicallyimportant reduction in drug levels, is unknown. Nevertheless, untilmore is known, it would seem prudent to monitor the outcome of concurrent use, being alert for a decrease in the efficacy of midazolam. Midazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between rooibos and other CYP3A4 substrates is possible.See the table Drugs herbs affecting or metabolised by thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, page 8 for a list of knownCYP3A4 substrates. 1. Matsuda K, Nishimura Y, Kurata N, Iwase M, Yasuhara H. Effects of continuous ingestion of herbal teas on intestinal CYP3A in the rat. J Pharmacol Sci Synonym(s) Dalmatian sage, Garden sage, Red sage, Salvia, True sage. There are many related species, which include Salvia lavandulifolia Vahl. (Spanish sage) and Salvia triloba L. (Greek sage). Pharmacopoeias Sage Leaf ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Sage Oil ( BP 2009 ); Sage Tincture (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Spanish Sage Oil ( BP 2009 , Ph Eur 6.4 ); Three-lobed Sage Leaf ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The major constituents of sage are flavonoids including luteolin and derivatives, caffeic acid derivatives, diterpenes and triterpenes. The essential oil components vary according to species and origin. Salvia officinalis contains the monoterpene hydrocarbons - and -thujones as the major components, together with 1,8-cineole, camphor and borneol, and others.Salvia lavandulifolia does not contain thujones, and Salvia triloba only small amounts, making these oils less toxic. Use and indications Sage is used traditionally to reduce 'hot flushes 'and hyperhidrosis associated with the menopause. It hasantiseptic and spasmolytic properties, and a tea infusion isused as a gargle for sore throats. Extracts are also strongly antioxidant. Sage ( Salvia lavandulifolia in particular because of the absence of thujones) has recently generated interest as a cognition enhancer due to its anticholinesterase properties.The oil may be applied topically as an antiseptic and rubefacient but it should not be taken internally, applied externally in large amounts or used by pregnant women.Note that sage is widely used as a flavouring in foods.Pharmacokinetics Anin vitro study1found that sage does not have a clinically significant inductive effect on the cytochrome P450isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Other in vitro studies found that sage does not inhibit CYP2D6, hepatic CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein to a clinicallyrelevant extent, although it may have some potentiallyclinically relevant effects on intestinal CYP3A4. In contrast,a further in vitro study 4found that sage had inhibitory effects on CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but thesefindings should be interpreted with caution, as the study alsofound St John' s wort to be a CYP3A4 inhibitor, whereas, clinically, it is a CYP3A4 inducer. Therefore sage appears to have a low potential for causing interactions by these mechanisms, although the potential for a clinically relevanteffect on intestinal CYP3A4 warrants further study. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in sage, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview No interactions with sage found. Sage is commonly used as aflavouring in foods. For information on the interactions ofindividual flavonoids present in sage, see under flavonoids, page 186. 1. Hellum BH, Hu Z, Nilsen OG.

Constituents The fruit of saw palmetto contains about 25% fatty acids (extracts are often standardised to a minimum of 11% total fatty capric, caprylic, lauric, palmitic,oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids oils. Sterols including campesterol, stig masterol and -sitosterol isoquercetin and kaempferol. Use and indications The main contemporary use of saw palmetto fruit is to treatthe urological symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It has also been used as a diuretic, a sedative, an endocrine agent, an antiseptic and thesex hormones. Pharmacokinetics Saw palmetto ( ProstaPro 160 containing 85to 95% study2in patients given debrisoquine, a probe substrate for CYP2D6, found that saw palmetto had no effect on this isoenzyme, and other clinical studies suggest that the in vitro effects reported for CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 may not be clinically relevant, see benzodiazepines, page 345, and dextromethorphan,page 346, for further information. Clinical studies with chlorzoxazone, page 345, and caffeine, page 345, also suggest that saw palmetto has no clinically relevant effect onCYP1E2 or CYP1A2, respectively. For information on thepharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in saw palmetto, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview There may be an increased response to anticoagulant treatment in patients who also take saw palmetto. Saw palmetto does not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on the majority of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and noother interactions with saw palmetto have been found.

Gurley BJ, Gardner SF, Hubbard MA, Williams DK, Gentry WB, Carrier J, Khan IA, Edwards DJ, Shah A. In vivo assessment of botanical 344Saw Anticoagulants The INR of one patient taking warfarin modestly increased after he took Curbicin (saw palmetto, cucurbita and vitamin E). This product has also been associated with an increased INR in apatient not taking anticoagulants. Excessive bleeding duringsurgery has been reported in another patient who had beentaking saw palmetto. Clinical evidence A 61-year-old man taking warfarin and simvastatin, with a stable INR of around 2.4, had an increase in his INR to 3.4 within 6 days of starting to take 5 tablets of Curbicin daily. Within a week of stopping theCurbicin , his INR had fallen to its previous value. Another elderly man who was not taking any anticoagulants and was taking 3tablets of Curbicin daily was found to have an INR of 2.1 (normal 0.9 to 1.2). His INR decreased (to between 1.3 and 1.4) when he was given vitamin K, but did not normalise until a week after the Curbicin was stopped. Curbicin is a herbal remedy used for micturition problems, and contains extracts from the fruit of sawpalmetto and the seed of Cucurbita pepo . 1 In addition, saw palmetto has been attributed to excessive bleeding in a 53-year-old man undergoing a surgical procedure toremove a brain tumour. An estimated 2 litres of blood were lostduring surgery and bleeding time did not return to normal for 5 days. The patient denied taking NSAIDs pre-operatively but admitted to taking saw palmetto for benign prostate hypertrophy. 2 Experimental evidence Saw palmetto may inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9 in vitro (see Pharmacokinetics, page 344), but it is not known if this is clinically relevant. Mechanism The authors of the first report suggest that what happened was possibly due to the presence of vitamin E in the Curbicin preparation (each tablet contains 10 mg), but vitamin E does not normally affectINRs. Experimental evidence suggests that saw palmetto may inhibitthe isoenzyme CYP2C9, which is an importantroute of warfarin metabolism. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to case reports and an experimental study of unknown clinical relevance. Because of the many otherfactors influencing anticoagulant control, it is not possible to reliablyascribe a change in INR specifically to a drug interaction in a singlecase report without other supporting evidence. It may be better toadvise patients to discuss the use of any herbal products that they wish to try, and to increase monitoring if this is thought advisable. Cases of uneventful use should be reported, as they are as useful aspossible cases of adverse effects. 1. Yue Q-Y, Jansson K.

Saw palmetto + Benzodiazepines No pharmacokinetic interaction appears to occur between sawpalmetto and alprazolam or midazolam. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, saw palmetto 320 mg daily for 16 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of a single 2-mg dose of alprazolam given on day 14.1In another study in 12 healthy subjects saw palmetto 160 mg twice daily for 28 days did not affect themetabolism of a single 8-mg dose of midazolam .2Experimental evidence Experimental studies have suggested that saw palmetto may inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. In vitro study suggested that saw palmetto inhibited this route or metabolism, but this does not appear to be clinicallyrelevant. Importance and management The findings of these studies suggest that saw palmetto does not alter the metabolism of alprazolam or midazolam, and therefore nodosage adjustments of these benzodiazepines would be expected tobe needed on concurrent use. Midazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between saw palmetto Y Multiple doses alter 74, 536 -42. 2.

Saw palmetto + Caffeine Saw palmetto does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of caffeine. Clinical evidence In a randomised study, 12 healthy subjects were given saw palmetto 160 mg twice daily for 28 days, with a single 100-mg dose of caffeine at the end of treatment with saw palmetto. The pharmacokinetics of caffeine were unchanged by saw palmetto.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Caffeine is metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2. Saw palmetto does not appear to inhibit this route of metabolism. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to the study cited, which suggests that in most patients saw palmetto is unlikely to raise caffeine levels. Caffeine is used as a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter- action between saw palmetto and other CYP1A2 substrates is unlikely. 1. Gurley BJ, Gardner SF, Hubbard MA, Williams DK, Gentry WB, Carrier J, Khan IA, Edwards DJ, Shah A. In vivo assessment of botanical supplementation 428 -40. Saw palmetto + Chlorzoxazone Saw palmetto does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of chlorzoxazone. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects the metabolism of a single 250-mgSaw palmetto 345 Sdose of chlorzoxazone was not affected by saw palmetto 160 mg twice daily for 28 days.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Chlorzoxazone is used as a probe substrate of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1. Saw palmetto does not appear to inhibit thisroute of metabolism. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to the study cited, which suggests that saw palmetto is unlikely to raise chlorzoxazone levels. Chlorzoxazone is used as a probe drug for CYP2E1 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between saw palmetto and other CYP2E1 substrates isunlikely. 1. Gurley BJ, Gardner SF, Hubbard MA, Williams DK, Gentry WB, Carrier J, Khan IA, Edwards DJ, Shah A. In vivo assessment of botanical supplementation 428 -40. Saw palmetto + Dextromethorphan Saw palmetto does not appear to affect the metabolism of dextromethorphan. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, saw palmetto 320 mg daily for 16 days did not affect the metabolism of a single 30-mg dose ofdextromethorphan given on day 14. 1Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Dextromethorphan is used as a probe substrate of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6. Saw palmetto does not appear to inhibit this route of metabolism. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to the study cited, which suggests that saw palmetto is unlikely to raise dextromethorphan levels. Dextromethorphan is used as a probe drug for CYP2D6 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokineticinteraction between saw palmetto and other CYP2D6 substrates isunlikely. This finding is confirmed by a study using debrisoquine, see Pharmacokinetics, page 344. 1. Markowitz JS, Donovan JL, RM, Ruan Y Multiple doses alter (2003) 74, 536 -42. Saw palmetto + Food No interactions found. Saw palmetto + Herbal medicines No chinensis Turcz. Schisandra sphenanthera Rehder & EH used with, or substituted for, Schisandra chinensis . Other species of Schisandra are also used medicinally in China. Constituents The major active components of the fruits of Schisandra chinensis are dibenzocyclooctene lignans. The identity and nomenclature are confusing, because, when originally isol- ated by different researchers, the same compounds were given different names. The main groups of compounds are theschisandrins (schizandrins) and the gomisins (some of which were originally called wuweizu esters) and their derivatives. Schisandrin is also referred to in the literature as schisandrol A, gomisin A as schisandrol B, deoxyschisan-drin as schisandrin A or wuweizu A, and schisantherin B asgomisin B or wuweizu B, for example. An essential oil contains borneol, 1,8-cineole, citral, sesquicarene and other monoterpenes. Extracts of Schisandra sphenanthera are reported to have a fairly similar chemical composition. Use and indications Schisandra is a very important herb in Chinese medicine. Itis used as a tonic and restorative and considered to have liver-protecting, cardiotonic, hypotensive, immunomodulat- ing, expectorant, hypnotic and sedative effects. It is used inthe treatment of asthma, hyperproliferative and inflammatory skin diseases, night sweats, urinary disorders, chronic diarrhoea, insomnia and many other conditions. Pharmacokinetics The effects of extracts of schisandra on cytochrome P450isoenzymes are reasonably well studied. The gomisins B, C,G and N, and -schisandrin have all demonstrated inhibition of CYP3A4 in vitro. Gomisin C was the most potent and competitive inhibitor and was even stronger than that ofketoconazole. It has also been suggested that CYP3A4 in another in vitro study. 2The conflicting effects found with gomisin B are unclear, but it has been suggested that, due to confusion over the naming and identification of these compounds, studies may have beencarried out with constituents with the same names butdifferent structures. 3,4Furthermore, the clinical effects ofthese extracts on CYP3A4 are unclear, as in vitro inhibition has not been replicated in rats, see nifedipine, page 348. Schisandra may also induce the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, see warfarin, page 348. In vitro studies using schisandrins A and B, schisandrols A and B [gomisin A] and schisantherin A [gomisin that these constituents of P-glycopro-tein, 3-8although schisandrols A and B [gomisin A] had only weak effects in one study.3 It has also been demonstrated that schisandrins A and B, schisandrols A and B [gomisin A] and schisantherin A[gomisin C] inhibitors of MDR1, a protein. 8,9 A study of Schisandra chinensis , ophio- pogonis and Fructus schisandrae) found that schisandrin was detectable in the plasma after each preparation, but afterthe aqueous extract or Sheng-Mai-San was given, the half-life and AUC of schisandrin were greater than when schisandrin alone was given. It is therefore possible that components of these products could alter the metabolism ofschisandrin. 10This may be important when extrapolating the effects of multi-constituent herbal preparations to the use of schisandra. Interactions overview Schisandra may modestly induce the metabolism of warfarinand greatly increase the absorption of tacrolimus, but it appears to have little effect on the metabolism of nifedipine. 1.

Schisandra + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Schisandra + Nifedipine The interaction between schisandra and nifedipine is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a single-dose study, ratswere given nifedipine 2 mg/kg 30 min- utes a 50-mg/kg dose of Shoseiryuto. The effects of Shoseiryuto were also studied in vitro inrats. Although the in vitro study found that Shoseiryuto inhibited CYP3A4, the study in ratsfound that the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine were not affected by the preparation. Shoseiryuto contains schisandra fruit, ephedraherb, cinnamon tuber and glycyrrhiza. 1 Mechanism Schisandra has been shown in vitro to have an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of nifedipine. This animal study does not support the in vitro findings. Importance and management Evidence appears to be restricted to experimental studies involving rats, and the findings, which cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, suggest that the in vitro effects do not seem to be clinically relevant in vivo . Because of the nature of the evidence, it is difficult to make recommendations on the concurrent use of nifedipine andShoseiryuto until human studies are conducted; however, a clinicallyrelevant interaction appears unlikely. 1. Makino T, Mizuno F, Mizukami H. Does a Kampo medicine containing schisandra affect pharmacokinetics of nifedipine greatly increases tacrolimus levels and its adverseeffects. Clinical evidence In a pharmacokinetic study, 12 healthy subjects were given an extract ofSchisandra sphenanthera (containing 33.75 mg schizandrin) twice daily for 14 days, with a single 2-mg oral dose of tacrolimus on day 14. The extract of Schisandra sphenanthera increased the AUC and maximum plasma concentrations of tacrolimus by 164% and 227%, but did not alter its half-life. Six of the 12 subjects experiencedindigestion, and burning hands and feet, one hour after bothmedicines were given. These symptoms resolved over 10 hours. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found.MechanismNot established. P-glycoprotein is involved in the intestinal absorp- tion of tacrolimus. It is therefore possible that the inhibition ofP-glycoprotein by schizandrin, and possibly other related com-pounds, may have resulted in increased absorption of tacrolimus. The authors also suggest that the metabolism of tacrolimus, which is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, may havebeen inhibited by schisandra. However, studies with nifedipine, seeabove, suggest that this effect may not be clinically relevant. Importance and management An interaction between schisandra and tacrolimus seems fairly well established, although the mechanism is not fully elucidated. Concurrent use appears to result in a large rise in tacrolimus levels,accompanied by an increase in tacrolimus adverse effects. If the useof both medicines is considered desirable it would seem prudent tomonitor the outcome of concurrent use closely, adjusting thetacrolimus dose as necessary. It is important to note that, althoughthe schisandra product used in the study was standardised forschisandrin content, this constituent has not been established as the cause of the interaction. Therefore the extent of the interaction may vary between different schisandra products, and different batches ofthe same schisandra product. This may make this interaction difficultto standardise for, and therefore it may be prudent to avoidconcurrent use where tacrolimus blood levels are critical, such as inorgan transplantation. 1. Xin H-W, Wu X-C, Li Q, Yu A-R, Zhu M, Shen Y, Su D, Xiong L. Effects of Schisandra sphenanthera extract on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in healthy volunteers. Br J Clin Pharmacol (2007) 64, 469 -75. Schisandra + Warfarin and related drugs The interaction between schisandra and warfarin is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in rats, pretreatment with schisandra aqueous extract 500 mg/kg daily by gastric lavage for 6 days reduced the AUC of a single 2-mg/kg dose of intravenous warfarin by 29%, and increased warfarin clearance by 37%. The half-life of warfarin was also reduced from 13.1 hours to 11.6 hours.1 Mechanism The authors of the study suggest that schisandra increases the metabolism of warfarin by inducing the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2C9, the most important isoenzyme involved inthe metabolism of warfarin. 1 Importance and management Evidence is limited to this one experimental study in rats, which suggests that schisandra extracts may modestly increase the metabolism of warfarin. If similar effects occur in humans there may be a slight decrease in the anticoagulant effects of warfarin,although note that a decrease in the AUC of 29% is fairly modestand only small effects would be expected. If schisandra extracts aregiven to any patient taking warfarin, it may be prudent to considermonitoring the INR within the first week of treatment, if this is notalready planned. All coumarin anticoagulants are metabolised byCYP2C9 to a greater or lesser extent, and therefore they may interact similarly. It would seem prudent to use similar precautions if these drugs are given with schisandra. 1. Mu Y, Zhang J, Zhang S, Zhou H-H, Toma D, Ren S, Huang L, Yaramus M, Baum A, Venkataramanan R, Xie W.

Constituents Anthraquinone glycosides are major components of senna. In the leaf the anthraquinones include sennosides A, B, C and D, and palmidin A, rhein anthrone and aloe-emodinglycosides. The fruit contains sennosides and and aclosely related glycoside, sennoside A1. Senna is usuallystandardised as sennoside B. Senna also contains the leaves and pods, mucilage (arabinose, galactose, galacturonic acid) and various other constituents such as flavonoids , volatile oil and resins. Use and indications Senna leaf or fruit is used as a laxative. Pharmacokinetics For information on the pharmacokinetics of an anthraqui- none glycoside present in senna, see under aloes, page 27. Interactions overview Although senna has been predicted to interact with a numberof drugs that lower potassium (such as the corticosteroidsand potassium-depleting diuretics), or drugs where theeffects become potentially harmful when potassium is lowered (such as digoxin), there appears to be little or no direct evidence that this occurs in practice. Senna mayslightly reduce quinidine levels.S 349Senna + Corticosteroids Theoretically, the risk of hypokalaemia might be increased in patients taking corticosteroids, who also regularly use, or abuse,anthraquinone-containing substances such as senna. Clinical evidence Chronic diarrhoea as a result of long-term use, or abuse, of stimulant laxatives such as senna can cause excessive water and potassiumloss; one paper (cited as an example) describes a number of cases of this. 1Systemic corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid effects can cause water retention and potassium loss. The effect of senna over-use combined with systemic corticosteroids is not known, but,theoretically at least, the risk of hypokalaemia might be increased.Although this is mentioned in some reviews on herbal interactions 2 there do not appear to be any case reports of such an interaction. It has also been suggested that senna, by increasing gastro- intestinal transit times, might theoretically reduce the absorption oforal corticosteroids. 2However, there appears to be no published clinical data suggesting that that the absorption of corticosteroids isaffected by senna or other drugs that alter gastrointestinal transittime, such as metoclopramide or loperamide. Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism In theory the additive loss of potassium caused by anthraquinone- containing substances and systemic corticosteroids may result inhypokalaemia. Importance and management The interaction between senna and corticosteroids is theoretical, but be aware of the potential in patients who regularly use, or abuse, anthraquinone-containing substances such as senna. However, notethat, if anthraquinone laxatives are used as recommended (at a doseproducing a comfortable soft-formed motion), then this interactionwould not be expected to be clinically relevant. 1.

Senna + Digitalis glycosides Theoretically, digitalis toxicity could develop if patients regu-larly use, or abuse, anthraquinone-containing substances such assenna. Clinical evidence For the risk of digitalis toxicity including cardiac arrhythmias because of hypokalaemia induced by abuse of anthraquinonelaxatives, see Aloes + Digitalis glycosides, page 28. For mentionof a case of digoxin toxicity and mild hypokalaemia in a patient taking digoxin and furosemide, who started to take a laxative containing rhubarb andliquorice , see Liquorice + Digitalis glyo- sides, page 274. Experimental evidence The effects of anthraquinones found in senna (rhein 100 micromoles, danthron B),and senna leaf infusion (senna tea) 10 mg/mL, on the absorption of digoxin was examined in human cell lines.1Rhein and danthron decreased the absorptive permeability of digoxin , whereas the other anthraquinones and the senna leaf infusion had no effect.Mechanism Little understood. Digoxin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a drug transporter protein, and it is thought that the relatively smallmolecular size of rhein and danthron alters the fluidity of the apicalmembrane and interferes with the action of P-glycoprotein. 1 Importance and management Determining the clinical relevance of the in vitro absorption study results is difficult. The authors suggest that an effect of anthraquinone-containing laxatives on the absorption of poorlypermeable drugs such as digoxin cannot be excluded. More study isrequired before any clinical recommendations can be made. 1. Laitinen L, Takala E, Vuorela H, Vuorela P, Kaukonen AM, Marvola M.

Experimental evidence The effects of the anthraquinones found in senna (rhein, danthron, sennidins A and B, sennosides A and B), and senna leaf infusion(senna tea), on the absorption of furosemide 100 micromoles, a poorly permeable drug, was examined in human cell lines.1Rhein and danthron increased the absorptive permeability 3.6- and 3-fold, respectively. Furosemide permeability was reduced by more than a third by the sennidins and sennosides, butsenna leaf infusion had little effect. Mechanism Little understood. The changes in furosemide absorptive permeabil- ity may be caused by interference with P-glycoprotein or other transporter proteins. 1 Importance and management Determining the clinical relevance of the in vitro absorption results is difficult. The authors suggest that an effect of anthraquinone- containing laxatives on the absorption of poorly permeable drugssuch as furosemide cannot be excluded.

Senna + Estradiol Senna does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of estradiol. Clinical evidence In a clinical study in 19 women, the maximum daily tolerated dose of senna tablets ( Senokot ) was taken for 10 to 12 days with a single 1.5-mg dose of estradiol glucuronide given 4 days before the end of the assessment period. Senna had no significant effect on the median AUC of estradiol or estrone.1350 Senna SExperimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It was thought that reducing intestinal transit time with senna might lead to reduced blood levels of estradiol. Importance and management Limited evidence suggests that there is unlikely to be a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between anthraquinone-con-taining laxatives and estradiol. 1.

Mechanism Little understood. The reduction in absorptive permeability of ketoprofen caused by danthron may be due to reduced ATPproduction in the cells. The enhanced permeability caused by sennaleaf infusion is more difficult to explain because of the manydifferent active compounds contained within the extract. 1 Importance and management Evidence is sparse, but what is known suggests that the use of anthraquinone-containing laxatives is unlikely to affect the intestinalpermeability of ketoprofen. 1.

Senna + Quinidine Quinidine plasma levels can be reduced by the anthraquinone- containing laxative senna. Clinical evidence In a study in 7 patients with cardiac arrhythmias taking sustained- release quinidine bisulfate 500 mg every 12 hours, senna reduced plasma quinidine levels, measured 12 hours after the last dose ofquinidine, by about 25%. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found.

It is also reported to beantispasmodic, aphrodisiac, demulcent, diuretic, anti-diar- rhoeal, antirheumatic and antidiabetic. are supported by pharmacological (but littleclinical) evidence. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview Shatavari may have additive effects with conventionalantidiabetic drugs, and may alter the absorption of a number of drugs by delaying gastric emptying. Shatavari contains phytoestrogens and therefore has the potential to beantagonistic or synergistic with oestrogens or oestrogen antagonists. S 353Shatavari + Antidiabetics The interaction between shatavari and antidiabetics is based on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In pharmacological studies, shatavari extracts have been shown to lower blood-glucose and stimulate insulin secretion. In one in vitro study, the insulin stimulatory effect of various extracts and partitionfractions of shatavari was potentiated by tolbutamide .1This suggests that might have some antidiabetic effects; this is in linewith one of its traditional uses as an antidiabetic. The evidence is tooslim to say whether a clinically important effect is likely for usualpreparations of the herb, but an additive antidiabetic effect withconventional medicines for diabetes seems possible. Bear thisinformation in mind in the event of an unexpected response totreatment. 1. Hannan JMA, Marenah L, PR, Insulin secretory actions of of isolated islets Endocrinol (2007) 192, 159 -68. Shatavari + Food No interactions found. Shatavari + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Shatavari + Miscellaneous Limited evidence suggests that shatavari increases the gastricemptying rate similarly to metoclopramide, which is known todecrease the absorption of atovaquone, digoxin (acetaminophen). Shatavari has the potentialto interact similarly. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a crossover study in 8 healthy subjects, 1powdered root of shatavari 2 g reduced the gastric emptying half-life from a mean baseline of about 160 minutes to 101 minutes after two radio-labelledjam sandwiches were eaten. This was similar to the effect of a single10-mg dose of oral metoclopramide (85 minutes). If shatavariincreases the gastric emptying rate, it has the potential to increaseor decrease the absorption of other drugs that are taken concurrently. Metoclopramide is known to have this effect and modestly decreases the absorption of atovaquone ,digoxin andketoprofen , mol (acetaminophen) . Based on the limited evidence presented, it is possible that shatavari might interact similarly. Until more is known,some caution might be appropriate; however, note that, with theexception of atovaquone , in most cases the interactions of metoclopramide with these drugs are of limited clinical importance. 1. Dalvi SS, Nadkarni PM, Gupta KC. Effect of Asparagus racemosus (Shatavari) on gastric emptying time in normal healthy volunteers. J Postgrad Med (1990) 36, 91 -4. Shatavari + Oestrogens or Oestrogen antagonists The interaction between shatavari and oestrogens or oestrogen antagonists is based on a prediction only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Shatavari contains phytoestrogens and has been investigated in a variety of pharmacological and clinical studies for its effect onlactation, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, premenstrual syndromeand menopausal symptoms; this has been the subject of a review. 1 Based on these studies, a cautious approach would be to recommend care when combining shatavari with conventional oestrogenic drugs or oestrogen antagonists such as tamoxifen , because it is unknown whether the effects might be antagonistic or synergistic (or, indeed,not clinically relevant). For further discussion of this subject, seeIsoflavones + Tamoxifen, page 262. 1. Bopana N, Saxena S.

Constituents The major acid (GABA) have also been found and there is a smallamount of essential oil present composed of monoterpenesand sesquiterpenes. Use and indications Skullcap has been used traditionally as a sedative and to treatnervous disorders. Previous reports about its possibletoxicity have been found to be because of contamination with Teucrium species; skullcap itself is now considered to be safe to use. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found for skullcap, but see flavonoids, page 186, for information on individual flavonoids present in the herb. Interactions overview No interactions with skullcap found, but for information on the interactions of individual flavonoids present in skullcap, see Pharmacopoeias Hydrogenated Soya Oil ( BP 2009 ); Hydrogenated Soybean Oil (Ph Eur 6.4 ,USP 32 ); Powdered Soy Isoflavones Extract (USP 32 ); Refined Soya Oil ( BP 2009 ); Soybean Oil (USP 32); Soybean Oil, Refined ( Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The isoflavones in soya beans consist mainly of genistein and with smaller amounts of isoformononetin, ononin, glycetein, desmethyltexasin and others. They are present mainly as glycosides, and the amount varies betweenthe different soya products. Soya beans also contain coumestans (mainly in the sprouts) and phytosterols . The fixed from soya beans contains linoleic and linolenicacids. Fermented soya products contain variable amounts of tyramine. Use and indications Soya is a widely used food, particularly in Japanese and Chinese cuisine. Flour and protein from the beans are used as tofu and as a substitute for meat. Fermented productsinclude soy sauce, natto and miso, and these can contain high concentrations of the isoflavones. Soya milk is used as a substitute for individuals who are allergic to cows 'milk, including in infant formula. Edamame beans are soya beanseaten while still green. There are numerous purported benefits of soya protein, the most well studied being possible reductions in hyperlipid-aemia, menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis, and preven-tion of some cancers. Epidemiological studies suggest that a diet with a high intake of soya might protect against breast cancer. 1Numerous randomised clinical studies show a small benefit for soya protein on blood lipids (which is probably independent of isoflavone content),2,3and there is also evidence of a modest benefit in patients with diabetes.4Soya protein and the isoflavone fraction have also shown some benefits for menopausal symptoms5and postmenopausal osteoporosis6in some studies. One paper notes that many of the demonstrable actions of isoflavones in soya are attributedto the aglycones genistein and daidzein; however, these occurin negligible amounts unless the product has been fermented. 7 For further information on the individual isoflavones presentin soya, see isoflavones, page 258. Despite numerous studiesand meta-analyses, the health benefits of soya have not beenconclusively proven and remain controversial. In a 2006analysis, the American Heart Advisory Committee concludedthat the main benefit of a soya-based diet probably relates to its high content of polyunsaturated fats and fibre and low content of saturated fat. 8 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects, a soya extract did not induce thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme soya bean products extract, as well the soyaisoflavones daidzein and inhibited CYP3A4 9,10and CYP2C9.9However, in one of these studies,10St John 's wort also inhibited CYP3A4, but clinically this herb is known tobe an inducer of CYP3A4. This highlights the problems ofextrapolating the findings of in vitro studies to clinical situations. 9Soya-based infant formulas (as well as cow-milk infant formulas) induced CYP1A2 in vitro see caffeine, page 357). The pharmacokinetics of the isoflavone constituents of soya are further discussed under isoflavones, page 258. Interactions overview Soya products may increase the metabolism of caffeine andreduce the absorption of levothyroxine. Fermented soya beanproducts contain high levels of tyramine and vitamin K andmay therefore cause hypertensive reactions with MAOIs, and decrease the activity of warfarin and related antic- oagulants. Potential interactions of isoflavone constituents of soya are covered under isoflavones; see antibacterials, page 260,nicotine, page 261, paclitaxel, page 261, 262, and theophylline, page 263. 1.

Phytomedicine (2003) 10, 334 - 42.S 356Soya + Antibacterials No data for soya found. For the theoretical possibility that broad- spectrum antibacterials might reduce the metabolism of theisoflavone constituents of soya, such as daidzein, by colonicbacteria, and so alter their efficacy, see Isoflavones + Antibacterials,page 260. Soya + Caffeine Soya products may increase the metabolism of caffeine. Clinical evidence Caffeine elimination is low in neonates, but increases faster in those receiving formula feeds (type not specified), than in breast-fedinfants. 1In another study of caffeine for apnoea, formula-fed (type not specified) infants required higher caffeine doses than breast-fed infants (4.4 mg/kg compared with 8.3 mg/kg), but still had lower trough caffeine levels.2 Experimental evidence Both soya-based and cow milk-based infant formulas induced the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 in in vitro studies, whereas breast milk samples from 29 women did not.3Conversely, note that high doses of the soya isoflavone daidzein modestly inhibitCYP1A2, see Isoflavones + Theophylline, page 263. Mechanism Neonates are less able to metabolise caffeine than adults: hepatic metabolism matures in the first year of life. Infant formula appears toinduce the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2, by which caffeineis metabolised. property is common to both cows 'milk and soya, so must be due to a common constituent of both, 3or the lack of a constituent present in breast milk.2The fact that soya isoflavones have some CYP1A2 inhibitory activity does not appear to counteract this effect. Importance and management Clinical evidence in support of an interaction between soya and caffeine is limited, because the two studies do not state the formula feeds used, although it seems likely that soya feeds are implicated; this suggestion is supported by experimental evidence. In infants,caffeine is dosed individually, but be aware that required doses arelikely to increase in those receiving formula feeds, including soya-based formula. Note that, conversely, in high doses, soya isoflavone supplements might reduce the required dose of CYP1A2 substrates such asIsoflavones + Theophylline, page RE, Leeder JS, Kearns GL.

Soya + Food No interactions found.Soya + Herbal medicines No interactions found. Soya + Levothyroxine and related drugs Soya products or soya isoflavones might increase the dose required of thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Clinical evidence A 45-year-old woman who had hypothyroidism after a near-total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablative therapy for papillarycarcinoma of the thyroid required unusually high oral doses of levothyroxine (300 micrograms daily) to achieve clinically effective levels of free thyroxine (T 4); suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was unsatisfactory, even at this dose. She hadroutinely been taking a 'soya cocktail 'protein supplement imme- diately after her levothyroxine. Taking the soya protein cocktail inthe morning and the levothyroxine in the evening avoided thiseffect. 1 A newborn infant with primary hypothyroidism failed to respond to a usual dose of levothyroxine until his soya formula was replacedwith cows 'milk formula. 2In another report, three infants with primary hypothyroidism fed soya formula required 18 to 25%decreases in their levothyroxine dose after soya formula wasdiscontinued. 3In a retrospective study of primary hypothyroidism, TSH values took longer to normalise in 8 infants fed soya formulathan in 70 other infants not given soya. 4 Historical data (from before the 1960s) show that soya formula without iodine supplementation caused goitre, which could bereversed by iodine supplementation. 2 Experimental evidence Soya isoflavones inhibited the activity of thyroid peroxidase, an enzyme required for thyroid hormone synthesis, in cell culture andanimal studies (this has been the subject of a review 5). However, soya isoflavones do not appear to cause thyroid hormone abnor-malities in euthyroid individuals (also reviewed 6). Mechanism Soya isoflavones clearly inhibit thyroid peroxidase; however, hypothyroidism does not usually occur unless iodine deficiency isalso present. Soya formula or other similar products might decreaselevothyroxine absorption in some individuals. Importance and management There is a good body of evidence, which suggests that soya products or soya isoflavones might increase the dose required of thyroidhormone replacement therapy. It would seem prudent to closelymonitor the resolution of primary hypothyroidism in infantsreceiving soya formula, and expect to use higher dose oflevothyroxine than anticipated in these individuals. Monitor thyroxine levels, and either discontinue the soya formula or further increase the dose if necessary. Similar precautions would seemprudent if patients receiving levothyroxine wish to take soyasupplements; however, remember that the intake of soya supple-mentation will need to remain relatively constant. 1.

Soya + MAOIs or RIMAs A potentially fatal hypertensive reaction can occur between the non-selective MAOIs and tyramine-rich foods. Significantamounts of tyramine may be present in fermented or preservedsoya products such as soy sauce and tofu, and it may be prudentto avoid these while taking an MAOI. Effects may last for up totwo weeks after discontinuation of the MAOI. However, other soya products such as dried textured soya protein and fresh soya beans are unlikely to contain important amounts of tyramine.The risk of a serious hypertensive reaction with moclobemide (orother RIMAs) is very much reduced. Most patients therefore donot need to follow the special dietary restrictions required withthe non-selective MAOIs. Clinical evidence A 33-year-old woman taking tranylcypromine 10 mg four times daily presented to an emergency department with global headache and stiffness of the neck and was found to have a blood pressure of230/140 mmHg and bradycardia of 55 bpm. Twenty minutes earliershe had eaten chicken teriyaki containing aged soy sauce. She wassuccessfully treated with intravenous labetolol. 1 Experimental evidence The tyramine content of a variety of soya products showed marked variability, including clinically significant tyramine levels in tofuwhen stored for one week and high tyramine content in one of 5 soysauces (a tyramine level of 6 mg or less was considered safe). 2In another analysis, high tyramine levels were found in two soy sauces,fermented soya beans, soya products (tofu, soya bean soup, bean flour, dried bean curd, soya bean drink) had low levels of tyramine, as did one fermented soya bean soup product (miso soup).3 Mechanism Potentiation of the pressor effect of tyramine.2Tyramine is formed in foods by the bacterial degradation of proteins, firstly to tyrosine and other amino acids, and the subsequent decarboxylation of the tyrosine to tyramine. This interaction is therefore not associated with fresh foods, but with those that have been allowed to over-ripen or'mature 'in some way, 4or if spoilage occurs. Tyramine is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic amine, one of its actions being torelease noradrenaline (norepinephrine) from the adrenergic neuronesassociated with blood vessels, which causes a rise in blood pressureby stimulating their constriction. 4 Normally any ingested tyramine is rapidly metabolised by the enzyme monoamine oxidase in the gut wall and liver before itreaches the general circulation. However, if the activity of theenzyme at these sites is inhibited (by the presence of an MAOI), anytyramine passes freely into the circulation, causing not just a rise inblood pressure, but a highly exaggerated rise due to the release fromthe adrenergic neurones of the large amounts of noradrenaline thataccumulate there during inhibition of MAO. 4 RIMAs such as moclobemide and toloxatone selectively inhibit MAO-A, which leaves MAO-B still available to metabolisetyramine. This means that they have less effect on the tyraminepressor response than non-selective MAOIs. Importance and management A potentially fatal hypertensive reaction can occur between the non-selective MAOIs and tyramine-rich foods. Significant amounts of tyramine may be present in fermented or preserved soya products such as soy sauce and tofu, and it may be prudent to avoid thesewhile taking an MAOI. Effects may last for up to two weeks afterdiscontinuation of the MAOI. However, other soya products such asdried textured soya protein and fresh soya beans are unlikely to contain important amounts of tyramine. Moclobemide is safer (in the context of interactions with tyramine-rich foods and drinks) than the non-selective MAOIs, because it is more readily reversible and selective. Therefore the riskof a serious hypertensive reaction with moclobemide (or otherRIMAs) is very much reduced. Most patients therefore do not needto follow the special dietary restrictions required with thenon-selective MAOIs. 1. Abrams JH, Schulman P, White WB.

Soya + Nicotine For discussion of a study showing that soya isoflavones (daidzeinand genistein) caused a minor decrease in the metabolism ofnicotine, see Isoflavones + Nicotine, page 261. Soya + Paclitaxel No data for soya found. For the possibility that genistein, anisoflavone present in soya, might markedly increase paclitaxel levels, see Isoflavones + Paclitaxel, page 261.

Soya + Theophylline No data for soya found. For the possibility that high doses of daidzein present in soya might modestly increase theophyllinelevels, see Isoflavones + Theophylline, page 263. Soya + Warfarin and related drugs Natto, a Japanese food made from fermented soya bean, canmarkedly reduce the effects of warfarin and acenocoumarol,because of the high levels of vitamin K 2substance produced in the fermentation process. In one study, soya bean protein alsomodestly reduced the effects of warfarin, and a similar case hasbeen reported with soy milk. Two cases of 'warfarin resistance ' have been seen in patients given intravenous soya oil emulsions.358 Soya SClinical evidence (a) Fermented soya bean products (natto) In a controlled study in 12 healthy subjects stabilised on acenocoumarol , a single meal containing 100 g of natto decreased the mean INR from 2.1 to 1.5 after 24 hours, and the INR had still not returned to the original level after 7 days (INR 1.75 one weeklater). The effect was considered clinically important in 6 of the 12subjects. 1Similarly, in an earlier retrospective study of 10 patients taking warfarin, eating natto caused the thrombotest values to risefrom a range of 12 to 29% up to a range of 33 to 100%. The extent of the rise appeared to be related to the amount of natto eaten. The thrombotest values fell again when the natto was stopped. A healthysubject taking warfarin, with a thrombotest value of 40%, ate 100 gof natto. Five hours later the thrombotest value was unchanged, but24 hours later it was 86%, and after 48 hours it was 90% (suggestingthat the anticoagulant effect was decreased). 2 (b) Soya milk In a 70-year-old man stabilised on warfarin 3 mg daily, consumption of soya milk 480 mL daily (240 mL of both Sun Soy and 8th Continent mixed together) decreased the INR from 2.5 to 1.6 after about 4 weeks.3One week after stopping the soya milk, his INR was 1.9, and 4 weeks after it was 2.5. (c) Soya oil Soya oil is an important source of dietary vitamin K. Two cases of 'warfarin resistance 'have been seen in patients given intravenous soya oil emulsions.4,5 (d) Soya protein In a study in 10 patients with hypercholesterolaemia who were stabilised on warfarin, substitution of all animal protein for texturedsoya protein for 4 weeks caused a marked reduction (Quick value approximately doubled) in the anticoagulant effects of warfarin by the second week. 6 Experimental evidence Experiments in animals to investigate the clinical observations for natto found that natto strongly antagonised the effects of warfarin.2 In one in vitro metabolism study in human liver microsomes,7 hydrolysed soya extract inhibited all of the tested, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (which areresponsible the metabolism of warfarin). This suggests that anincreased warfarin effect might have been expected, but the authorspoint out there is a lack of concordance between in vitro andin vivo findings. Mechanism Soya beans are a moderate source of vitamin K 1(19 micrograms per 100 g),8and soya oil and products derived from it are an important dietary source of vitamin K. However, the soya milk brand taken in the case report did not contain vitamin K,3and another referencesource lists soya milk as containing just 7.5 micrograms vitamin Kper 250 mL, 8which would not be expected to cause an interaction. Why this product decreased the effect of warfarin is therefore open to speculation. The vitamin K content of textured soya protein is unknown. Note that soy sauce made from soya and wheat is reported to contain no vitamin K, and soft tofu made from the curds by coagulating soyamilk contains only low levels (2 micrograms per 100 g). 8 In contrast, fermented soya bean products such as natto contain very high levels of a particular vitamin K 2substance (MK-7),9 because of the fermentation process with Bacillus natto . In addition, the bacteria might continue to act in the gut to increase the synthesisand subsequent absorption of vitamin K 2.2Although the role of vitamin K 2in anticoagulation is less well established than vitamin K1, it appears that this also opposes the actions of coumarins and indanediones, which are vitamin K antagonists. Importance and management The interaction between warfarin and fermented soya bean products is established, marked and likely to be clinically relevant in allpatients. Patients taking coumarin and probably indanedione anticoagulants should be advised to avoid natto, unless they want to consume a regular, constant amount. Although information is limited, it appears that soya protein might also modestly reduce the effect of warfarin. In particular, complete substitution of animal protein for soya protein appears to reduce theeffect of warfarin. Case reports suggest that soya milk and soya oilmay also interact, and therefore some caution would be prudent withthese products. On the basis of known vitamin K content, wholesoya beans could potentially reduce the effect of warfarin, whereas soy sauce should not.8Note that patients taking coumarins and indanediones are advised to have their INR checked if they markedly change their diet. This would seem particularly importantif they decide to change their intake of soya-related products. 1. Schurgers LJ, Shearer MJ, Hamuly\u00e1k K, St\u00f6cklin E, Vermeer C.

Haemostasis (2000) 30, ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ,USP 32 ); St John 's Wort Dry Extract, Quantified (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The main groups of active constituents of St John' s wort are thought to be also present. Other polyphenolic constituents include caffeic and chlorogenic acids, and a volatile oil containingmethyl-2-octane. Most St John 's wort products are standardised at least for their hypericin content (BP 2009 ), even though hyperforin is known to be a more relevant therapeutic constituent, andsome preparations are now standardised for both ( USP 32 ). It is important to note that there will be some natural variation, and as both hypericin and hyperforin are sensitive to light, they are relatively unstable, so processes used duringextraction and formulation, as well as storage conditions, can affect composition of the final product. Therefore different preparations of St John's wort have differentchemical profiles and they may not be equivalent in effect. Use and indications St John 's wort is widely used to treat mild-to-moderate depression, seasonal affective disorder, low mood, anxiety and insomnia, particularly if associated with menopause. It has also been used topically for its astringent properties. Pharmacokinetics St John 's wort has been implicated in numerous clinical interactions with conventional drugs and has therefore beenextensively studied. Alongside the extensive clinical studies and case reports, there is also a plethora of in vitro and animal experimental data regarding its interactions and pharmacokinetics. This monograph will discuss the clinicalevidence in preference to experimental data, where extensive literature is available and the clinical data are conclusive. The main constituent found to be responsible for the activity of St John 's wort is hyperforin, but other constituentsare considered to contribute to its antidepressant activity,such as hypericin and pseudohypericin, the flavonoid quercetin and its glycosides, and rutin. Bioavailability from varying formulations and extracts appears to be low, givingvariable steady-state plasma concentrations. 1For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present inSt John 's wort, see under flavonoids, page 186. (a) Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes St John 's wort is known to affect several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and this accounts for the wide range of drugswith which St John' s wort has been reported to interact. It is thought to exert a biphasic effect on these isoenzymes, with inhibition occurring in in vitro studies with the initial exposure, and induction following long-term use. 2Therefore, predicting the overall effect from in vitro and animal experiments may not always be reliable. The following is a list of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that have been assessed with St John 's wort in a clinical setting: .CYP3A4: the main clinically relevant effect of St John's wort on cytochrome P450 is the induction of CYP3A4. This has been shown to be related to the constituent,hyperforin. Products vary in their hyperforin content; preparations with a high-hyperforin content, given for a long period of time, will induce CYP3A4 activity, andtherefore decrease the levels of drugs metabolised byCYP3A4, by a greater extent than preparations containing low-hyperforin levels taken for a shorter period of time. . Conventional drugs are often used as probe substrates in order to establish the activity of another drug on specific isoenzyme systems. For CYP3A4 the preferred probe drug is midazolam, because it has no effects of its own on CYP3A4, and is metabolised almost exclusively byCYP3A4, with no known interference from other meta- bolic processes, such as transporter proteins. See St John' s wort + Benzodiazepines, page 364, for an example of the effects of St John 's wort on CYP3A4. . Studies have assessed the duration of the effects of St John 's wort on CYP3A4. One study found that CYP3A4 activity returned to baseline in about one week after StJohn 's wort was taken for 14 days. This may provide an indication of how long to leave between using St John' s wort and starting another drug, and therefore avoidingclinically important interactions. 3However, another study found that the effects of St John' s wort lasted for more than 2 weeks in some patients.4See the table Drugs and herbs affecting or metabolised by the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP3A4, page 8 for a list of known CYP3A4substrates.S 360.CYP2C19: there are some clinical reports suggesting that St John 's wort induces CYP2C19. See St John' s wort + Proton pump inhibitors, page 375, for a clinically relevant example of this. .CYP2C8: St John' s wort may induce CYP2C8, see repaglinide , under St John 's wort + Antidiabetics, page 362 for a clinically relevant example of this. .CYP2C9: St John 's wort may induce CYP2C9 (see St John 's wort + Warfarin and related drugs, page 379), but the mechanism for these interactions is not conclusivebecause not all CYP2C9 substrates have been found tointeract (see tolbutamide , under St John 's wort + Antidiabetics, page 362). . CYP2E1: St John 's wort may induce CYP2E1 but the general clinical importance of this is unclear, see St John' s wort + Chlorzoxazone, page 366. .CYP1A2: St John 's wort is also thought to be an inducer of CYP1A2 as levels of caffeine, page 365, and theophylline, page 377, both of which are CYP1A2 substrates, have been reduced by St John' s wort. However, the general clinical importance of this is unclear as otherstudies have found no clinically significant effect on these drugs. This may be because St John' s wort only has a minor inducing effect on CYP1A2, which may depend on the level of exposure to hyperforin. . CYP2D6: St John 's wort does not appear to affect the activity of CYP2D6 to a clinically relevant extent, see StJohn 's wort + Dextromethorphan, page 367, and St John' s wort + Tricyclic antidepressants, page 378. (b) P-glycoprotein St John' s wort is known to affect P-glycoprotein activity, especially intestinal P-glycoprotein, and it is generallythought that inhibition takes place initially, and briefly, butis followed by a more potent and longer-acting induction. Itis the induction that leads to the clinically relevant drug interactions of St John 's wort that occur as a result of this mechanism. 5Hyperforin is implicated as the main constitu- ent responsible for the effect, see St John' s wort + Digoxin, page 368.(c) Serotonin syndrome St John 's wort inhibits the reuptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) and this has resulted in a pharmacody- namic interaction, namely the development of serotoninsyndrome (see under Pharmacodynamics, page 10) withconventional drugs that also have serotonergic properties. These include bupropion, page 364, SNRIs, page 375, SSRIs, page 376, and triptans, page 379. Interactions overview St John 's wort is known to interact with many conventional drugs because of its ability to induce the activity of CYP3A4and P-glycoprotein, which are involved in the metabolismand distribution of the majority of drugs. CYP2C19,CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 may also be induced by St John' s wort, although the evidence is not conclusive and furtherstudy is needed. In general, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 do notappear to be significantly affected by St John' s wort; however, isolated reports of an interaction have still occurred. Hyperforin is the active constituent believed to be central to the inducing effects of St John' s wort. As St John 's wort preparations and dose regimens are varied, the amount of hyperforin exposure will also vary a great deal,which makes predicting whether an interaction will occur,and to what extent, difficult.

Clinical evidence A 47-year-old woman who was taking St John 's wort ( Hyperiforce , dose not stated), experienced a phototoxic reaction on skin areas exposed to light 6 hours after receiving 5-aminolevulinic acid 40 mg/kg. She developed a burning erythematous rash and severe swelling of the face, neck and hands. Treatment with oralcorticosteroids resulted in complete resolution after skin desquama-tion. 1 Experimental evidence Anin vitro study using human cell lines found that the combination of 5-aminolevulinic acid and an extract of St John 's wort (Hyperiforce ) increased light-induced toxicity by up to 15%.1 MechanismIt was suggested that there was a synergistic photosensitivity reaction between the two drugs. Importance and management This appears to be the only report of such an effect, but bear it in mind in the event of an unexpected adverse reaction to5-aminolevulinic acid. 1. Ladner DP, Klein SD, Steiner RA, Walt H. Synergistic toxicity delta-aminolaevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX used for photodiagnosis and hypericum extract, a herbal antidepressant. Br J Dermatol (2001) 144, 901 -22. St John's wort + Anaesthetics, general It has been predicted that St John 's wort may prolong the effects of anaesthetics, which is supported by an isolated case. A case of profound hypotension during anaesthesia following the long-term use of St John 's wort has also been reported. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends that all herbal medi-cines should be stopped two weeks prior to elective surgery. Clinical evidence Prolonged anaesthesia has been reported in a 21-year-old woman who had been taking St John 's wort 1 g three times daily for 3 months before general anaesthetics were given for the surgicalremoval of an abscess. Anaesthesia induced the procedure by sevoflurane andnitrous oxide using a facemask.1 Another case report describes a healthy 23-year-old woman, who had been taking St John 's wort on a daily basis for 6 months, who developed severe hypotension (BP 60/20 mmHg) during generalanaesthesia, which responded poorly to ephedrine and phenylephrine(BP increased to 70/40 mmHg). 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It has been suggested that St John 's wort may prolong anaesthesia,3-6 but there are no reports of this occurring. This appears to have been based on the possibility that St John 's wort acts as an MAOI4,6,7 (although this has been disputed8), and the limited evidence that MAOIs may inhibition and potentiate theeffects of barbiturates. 9,10 However, there is now increasing evidence that St John 's wort induces hepatic enzymes, and might therefore increase the metab-olism of barbiturates, which suggests that it could increaserequirements for thiopental anaesthesia. The possible MAOI activity of St John' s wort has led to the recommendation that the same considerations apply as for other MAOIs and general anaesthetics.6,7 The authors of the second case report suggest that St John 's wort might have caused adrenergic desensitisation with decreasedresponsiveness to the vasopressors. 2 Importance and management Not established. The evidence presented suggests that some caution may be warranted in patients using St John 's wort if they are given general anaesthetics. Because of the limited information, theAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists have recommended discon-tinuation of all herbal medicines 2 weeks before an electiveanaesthetic 3,5and, if there is any doubt about the safety of a product, this may be a prudent precaution.4 1.

St John's wort + Antidiabetics St John 's wort modestly decreases the AUC of gliclazide and rosiglitazone. Pioglitazone and repaglinide are similarly metab-olised and may therefore be expected to interact similarly. StJohn 's wort does not affect the metabolism of tolbutamide. Clinical evidence (a) Gliclazide In a study in 21 healthy subjects, a 300-mg dose of a St John 's wort preparation with a high hyperforin content (LI 160, Lichtwer Pharma ) was given 3 times daily for 15 days. On the last day of treatment, a single 80-mg dose of gliclazide was given, followed30 minutes later by glucose 75 g. St John 's wort reduced the maximum levels and AUC of gliclazide by 22% and 35%,respectively. The clearance was increased by 47%. No statistically significant changes were found in the AUC 0-4or blood levels of glucose or insulin.1 (b) Rosiglitazone A preliminary report of a pharmacokinetic study2states that St John 's wort 900 mg daily decreased the AUC of a single dose of rosiglitazone by 26% and increased its clearance by 35%. (c) Tolbutamide In a study using tolbutamide as a probe drug for CYP2C9 activity, St John 's wort 900 mg had no effect on the metabolism of a single dose of tolbutamide either after one day or after 2 weeks of use. The StJohn 's wort product used was from Sundown Herbals and provided about 33 mg of hyperforin daily. 3Similarly, in another study, a St John 's wort preparation with low hyperforin content ( Esbericum )a t a dose of 240 mg daily (which provided about 3.5 mg of hyperforindaily) had no effect on tolbutamide metabolism. 4362 St John' s wort SExperimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Gliclazide is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9 and the authors suggest that St John 's wort induces this isoenzyme, thereby increasing the metabolism of gliclazide and reducing its levels. The magnitude of this effect was not influencedby CYP2C9 genotype. 1The fact that tolbutamide, another CYP2C9 substrate, was unaffected by St John's wort suggests that otherfactors may be involved. Rosiglitazone is known to be metabolised principally by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C8, and it was thereforeconcluded that St John 's wort induces this isoenzyme. The magnitude of the effect of St John 's wort does not appear to be influenced by CYP2C8 genotype. 2 Importance and management The clinical relevance of the modest reduction in rosiglitazone levels has not been assessed, but it would seem unlikely to be important. However, the authors state that concurrent use of St John 's wort should be monitored when patients are also given CYP2C8 substrates. Pioglitazone and repaglinide are also substrates of CYP2C8, and would therefore be expected to be similarly affected,although possibly not to a clinically relevant extent. A large decreasein pioglitazone levels would not be expected on the basis thatrifampicin, a more potent enzyme inducer than St John 's wort, only caused a 54% reduction in the AUC of pioglitazone. However, the UK manufacturer 5recommends caution when prescribing pioglita- zone with drugs that induce CYP2C8. All three drugs are also substrates for CYP3A4, of which St John 's wort is an established inducer. Further study is needed. The small reduction in the levels of gliclazide do not appear to be clinically important as its blood-glucose-lowering effects wereunaffected. Whether or not St John 's wort induces CYP2C9 to a clinically relevant extent remains inconclusive. No special precautions appear to be necessary if tolbutamide and St John' s wort are used together. Note that, regardless of whether an interaction occurs, the dose of antidiabetics should be titrated to achieve adequate diabetic control. 1.

Takeda Ltd. UK Summary of product characteristics, August 2007. St John's wort + Antiepileptics St John 's wort modestly increased the clearance of single-dose carbamazepine, but had no effect on multiple-dose carbamaze- pine pharmacokinetics. Carbamazepine does not appear tosignificantly affect the pharmacokinetics of hypericin orpseudohypericin (constituents of St John 's wort). St John 's wort increased the clearance of mephenytoin by about 3-fold andis predicted to reduce the blood levels of phenytoin andphenobarbital, but this awaits clinical confirmation. Clinical evidence In a multiple-dose study in 8 healthy subjects, St John 's wort had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine or its metabolite (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide). In this study, subjects took carba- mazepine 200 mg increased to 400 mg daily alone for 20 days, thenwith St John 's wort 300 mg (standardised to hypericin 0.3%) three times daily for a further 14 days.1In contrast, the AUC of a single 400-mg dose of carbamazepine was reduced by 21% after St John 's wort 300 mg was given three times daily for 14 days, and the AUC of the 10,11-epoxide metabolite was increased by 26%.2 A double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy subjects found that, apart from a modest 29% decrease in the AUC ofpseudohypericin, carbamazepine did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either hypericin or pseudohypericin, which areboth constituents of St John' s wort. 3 In another placebo-controlled study in 6 extensive metabolisers of CYP2C19, St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily for 14 days increased the clearance of a single oral dose of mephenytoin 100 mg given on day 15, by about 3-fold. There were no significant effectswhen mephenytoin was given to 6 poor metabolisers of CYP2C19. Each St John 's wort tablet contained 0.3% hypericin and 4% hyperforin.4 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism St John 's wort is a known inducer of CYP3A4, and the results with single-dose carbamazepine are as predicted. However, carbamaze- pine is also an inducer of CYP3A4, and induces its own metabolism(autoinduction). It is suggested that St John 's wort is not sufficiently potent an inducer to further induce carbamazepine metabolism whenautoinduction has occurred, 1and therefore a small interaction is seen with single doses but no interaction is seen with multiple doses.However, the lack of effect seen in some of these studies may also bedue to the different preparations used, and therefore differing levelsof hyperforin. Mephenytoin is a substrate of CYP2C19 and St John's wort appears to induce this isoenzyme. Importance and management The available evidence suggests that a clinically significant inter- action between carbamazepine and St John 's wort is unlikely. Before the publication of the above reports, the CSM in the UK had advisedthat patients taking a number of drugs including the antiepileptics carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital should not take St John 's wort.5This advice was based on predicted pharmacokinetic interactions. In the light of the above studies, this advice may no longer apply to carbamazepine, although further study is needed.Until more is known, it would probably be prudent to avoidconcurrent use in patients taking mephenytoin, phenytoin and phenobarbital (and therefore primidone ), especially as phenytoin is also a substrate of CYP2C19, which St John's wort also appears to induce. The situation with carbamazepine is less clear. As the pharmacokinetic effects reported were modest, it may not benecessary to avoid St John' s wort; however, concurrent use should probably still be monitored to ensure adequate carbamazepine levelsand efficacy. Note that St John's wort does not appear to interfere with laboratory assays for carbamazepine, phenytoin ,phenobarbital or valproate . See St John 's wort + Laboratory tests, page 372. 1.

Important interactionsbetween St John 's wort (Hypericum perforatum ) preparations and prescribed medicines. February 2000 http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/comms-ic/documents/websiteresources/con019563.pdf (accessed 27/11/2008).St John' s wort 363 SSt John's wort + Benzodiazepines Long-term use of St John 's wort decreases the plasma levels of alprazolam, midazolam and quazepam. St John 's wort prepar- ations taken as a single dose, or containing low-hyperforin levels, appear to have less of an effect. Clinical evidence (a) Alprazolam In a study in 12 healthy subjects, St John 's wort ( LI 160, Lichtwer Pharma , 0.12 to 0.3% hypericin) 300 mg three times daily for 16 days with a single 2-mg dose of alprazolam on day 14. The AUC of alprazolam was halved by St John 's wort and the clearance was increased by about twofold.1 In another study, alprazolam 1 or 2 mg was given to 7 healthy subjects on the third day of a 3-day treatment period with St John 's wort ( Solaray ; hypericin content standardised at 0.3%) 300 mg three times daily. The pharmacokinetics of alprazolam were unchanged bySt John 's wort, but the authors note that 3 days may have been an insufficient time for St John 's wort to fully induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. 2In another study, 16 healthy subjects were given St John 's wort extract 120 mg ( Esbericum capsules; corresponding to 0.5 mg total hypericins and 1.76 mg hyperforin) twice daily for10 days. A single 1-mg dose of alprazolam was given on the daybefore treatment with St John 's wort and on the last day of treatment. St John 's wort extract at this low dosage and low hyperforin content had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics ofalprazolam, when compared with 12 subjects given placebo. 3 (b) Midazolam An open-label study in 12 healthy subjects found that a single 900- mg dose of St John' s wort had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of either oral midazolam 5 mg or intravenous midazolam 0.05 mg/kg, although there was a trend for increased oral clearance. However, St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily for 14 or 15 days decreased the AUC and maximumplasma concentration of oral midazolam by about 50% and 40%, respectively. Intravenous midazolam was not significantly affected. Similar results were found in another six studies. 4-9In one of the studies, although no serious adverse events occurred, 3 subjects reported that the sedative effects of midazolam were less noticeablewhen St John's wort was taken at the same time. 6 (c) Quazepam In a placebo-controlled study, 13 healthy subjects were given St John 's wort ( TruNature ; hypericin content standardised at 0.3%) 300 mg three times daily for 14 days with a single 15-mg dose of quazepam on day 14. St John 's wort modestly decreased the AUC and maximum plasma levels of quazepam by 26% and 29%,respectively, but the pharmacodynamic effects of quazepam were notaffected. 10 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Alprazolam, midazolam and quazepam are substrates of the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4. St John 's wort appears to induce CYP3A4, thus increasing the metabolism of oral midazo- lam,5-9,11 alprazolam1and quazepam,10and reducing the bioavail- ability of these benzodiazepines. Hyperforin appears to be the main active constituent that induces CYP3A4, because high-hyperforin extracts have more of aninducing effect than low-hyperforin extracts. 6-9 Importance and management Although not all the studies found an interaction between St John 's wort and alprazolam or midazolam, those that did found a reduction in levels, which is in line with the known CYP3A4-inducing effects of St John 's wort. The variable findings reported in the studies (somefound no interaction) could be due to the preparation of St John 's wort used and the duration of treatment.2,9Until more is known about the interacting constituents of St John' s wort, and the amount necessary to provoke an interaction, it would seem prudent to monitor patients receiving alprazolam and oral midazolam concur-rently for any signs of reduced efficacy. Single doses of intravenous midazolam do not appear to be significantly affected. Note that triazolam is also a substrate of CYP3A4 and is likely to be affected in the same way as alprazolam and midazolam. The modest reduction in quazepam levels did not reduce its efficacy; however, it may be prudent to bear the potential for an interaction in mind should a patient taking St John 's wort have a reduced response to quazepam. Those benzodiazepines that undergo glucuronidation, such as lorazepam ,oxazepam andtemazepam , would not be expected to be affected by St John 's wort, and may be useful alternatives. 1.

St John's wort + Bupropion Two cases describe symptoms indicative of serotonin syndrome when bupropion was taken with long-term St John 's wort. Clinical evidence A 58-year-old woman who had been taking St John 's wort 300 mg daily for several years and receiving HRT (estradiol and medroxy- progesterone) developed acute facial dystonia affecting the right sideof her face, neck and right arm when she started taking bupropion150 mg daily for 4 days. The episodic spasms were completelyresolved after 5 months of treatment with oral chorpheniramine,procyclidine, diazepam and carbamazepine. 1 A brief report describes the development of mania in one patient, which was associated with the concurrent use of St John 's wort and bupropion.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism A pharmacodynamic interaction may occur between St John 's wort and bupropion because they can both inhibit the reuptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). Serotonin syndrome has been seen364 St John' s wort alone,3and so additive serotonergic effects appear to be the explanation for what occurred in the cases described here. Importance and management Information appears to be limited to these two reports, one of which is lacking detail. Nevertheless because of the potential severity of thereactions it would seem prudent to monitor concurrent use closelyfor an increased incidence of adverse reactions. 1.

St John's wort + Buspirone Two patients taking buspirone developed marked CNS effectsafter starting to take herbal medicines including St John 's wort. Clinical evidence A 27-year-old woman who had been taking buspirone 30 mg daily for over one month started to take St John 's wort ( Hypericum 2000 Plus, Herb Valley, Australia) three tablets daily. After 2 months she complained of nervousness, aggression, hyperactivity, insomnia,confusion and disorientation, which was attributed to serotoninsyndrome. The St John 's wort was stopped, the buspirone was increased to 50 mg daily and her symptoms resolved over a week. 1A 42-year-old woman who was taking fluoxetine 20 mg twice dailyand buspirone 15 mg twice daily started to develop symptoms ofanxiety, with episodes of over-sleeping and memory deficits. It was discovered that she had been self-medicating with St John 's wort, ginkgo biloba and melatonin . She was asked to stop the non- prescribed medication and her symptoms resolved.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The exact mechanism of these interactions is not clear, but it seems most likely they were due to the additive effects of the buspirone andthe herbal medicines, either through their effects on elevating moodor through excess effects on serotonin. Fluoxetine may have had apart to play in one of the cases. See St John 's wort + SSRIs, page 376. Importance and management The clinical significance of these cases is unclear, but they highlight the importance of considering adverse effects from herbal medicineswhen they are used with conventional medicines. 1.

St John's wort + Caffeine Two studies suggest that St John 's wort increases the metabolism of caffeine. However, four other studies using preparations ofvarying hyperforin content suggest that the metabolism ofcaffeine is not affected by St John 's wort. Clinical evidence A study in 16 healthy subjects given a single 200-mg dose of caffeine before and after St John 's wort 300 mg (containing 900 micrograms of hypericin) three times daily for 14 days foundno overall change in the pharmacokinetics of caffeine. However, when the subset of 8 female patients was considered, it was foundthat there was an induction of CYP1A2 in this group of patients resulting in an increase in the production of caffeine metabolites. 1 In another study, St John 's wort 300 mg given to 12 healthy subjects three times daily for 28 days, modestly increased the metabolism of caffeine 100 mg (a CYP1A2 probe substrate) toparaxanthine by about 26%, although no serious adverse eventsoccurred. The St John's wort preparation used was standardised to0.3% hypericin and provided each subject with about 12.2 mg ofhyperforin daily. 2However, a later study using the same criteria in 12 elderly healthy subjects found that St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily for 28 days (standardised to hypericin 0.3%) generallyhad no statistically significant effect on the metabolism of a single100-mg dose of caffeine to paraxanthine taken on day 28, althoughsome individuals showed moderate changes. 3 Similarly, another study in 28 healthy subjects found no signifi- cant change in caffeine pharmacokinetics when a low-hyperforin (about 3.5 mg daily) St John' s wort extract ( Esbericum ) 120 mg was given twice daily for 11 days to patients who had received a single caffeine dose of 100 mg before St John's wort was started, and onthe last day of the study. 4These findings were also reported in two other studies using caffeine as a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity anda St John' s wort regimen that provided a high-hyperforin dose. One study gave hyperforin 33 mg and hypericin 2.5 mg daily, and theother gave a minimum of hyperforin 36 mg and hypericin 2.7 mg daily. 5,6 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism These studies investigated whether St John 's wort had any effect on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2 by which caffeine is metabolised. Importance and management The extent of any interaction with caffeine may depend on the St John 's wort preparation involved and dose used and may be correlated with the dose of hyperforin.4However, these studies generally suggest that an interaction between St John 's wort and caffeine is unlikely to be clinically important. Caffeine is often usedas a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results alsosuggest that a significant pharmacokinetic interaction as a result ofthis mechanism between St John 's wort and other CYP1A2 substrates is unlikely. Note that St John 's wort has only minimal effects on the metabolism of theophylline, which is also a CYP1A2substrate, consider also St John 's wort + Theophylline, page 377. 1.

Other calcium-channel blockers would be expected to interact similarly. Clinical evidence (a) Nifedipine In a study in 10 healthy subjects, St John 's wort 900 mg daily for 14 days decreased the maximum levels and AUC of a single oral dose of nifedipine 10 mg by about 38% and 45%, respectively. The maximum levels and AUC of the active metabolite of nifedipine, dehydronifedipine, were raised by about 45% and 26%, respectively.The St John 's wort preparation used was standardised to contain hypericin 0.3% and hyperforin 5%. 1 (b) Verapamil In a study in 8 healthy subjects, verapamil 24 mg was given as a jejunal perfusion over 100 minutes both before and after treatment with St John 's wort tablets ( Movina ; containing 3 to 6% hyperforin) 300 mg three times daily for 14 days. St John 's wort did not affect jejunal permeability or the absorption of either R-o r S-verapamil. The AUCs of R- and S-verapamil were decreased by 78% and 80%, respectively, and the peak plasma levels were decreased by 76% and 78%, respectively. The terminal half-life was not changed signifi-cantly. The AUC for R-verapamil was sixfold higher than that of S- verapamil and St John 's wort did not change this ratio. 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It appears that St John 's wort decreased the bioavailability of both nifedipine and verapamil by inducing their metabolism by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 in the gut. An effect on P- glycoprotein-mediated transport is not likely, as intestinal permea-bility was not significantly altered. 2 Importance and management The general importance of this interaction is unclear, as neither study reported on the clinical outcome of these reductions in calcium-channel blocker levels. Patients taking St John 's wort with nifedipine or verapamil should have their blood pressure and heart ratemonitored to ensure that they are still effective, and the dose shouldbe adjusted if needed. There appears to be no information aboutother calcium-channel blockers, but as they are all metabolised byCYP3A4, to a greater or lesser extent, it would seem prudent tomonitor concurrent use carefully. 1.

St John's wort + Chlorzoxazone St John 's wort increases the clearance of chlorzoxazone. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, St John's wort 300 mg three times daily for 28 days more than doubled the clearance of chlorzoxazone500 mg (a CYP2E1 probe substrate). The St John 's wort preparation used was standardised to a concentration of hypericin 0.3% andprovided each subject with about 12.2 mg of hyperforin daily. 1A later study using the same criteria in 12 healthy subjects (agedbetween 60 and 76 years) found that St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily for 28 days increased the metabolism of a single 500-mgdose of chlorzoxazone to hydroxychorzoxazone by only 26%. TheSt John 's wort preparation used in this study provided a daily dose of 4.8 mg of hyperforin. 2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It appears that St John 's wort increases the clearance of chlorzoxazone by inducing its metabolism by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1. Importance and management The clinical relevance of this interaction is unclear but, as no adverse events were reported in the studies, it is unlikely to be of generalimportance. The authors of the second study suggested that thelower induction of CYP2E1 may have occurred because of inter-individual variability or because there is an age-related reduction inCYP2E1 activity. 2However, the dose of hyperforin was only about one-third of the dose used in the first study, and this may alsoaccount for the difference in degree of induction seen. Nevertheless,because only a single dose of chlorzoxazone was used in thesestudies, if a patient is taking St John's wort, it may be prudent tomonitor for any signs of reduced chlorzoxazone efficacy. Aschlorzoxazone is used as a probe drug for CYP2E1 activity, beaware that St John's wort may induce the metabolism of otherCYP2E1 substrates. 1.

St John's wort + Ciclosporin Marked reductions in ciclosporin blood levels and transplant rejection can occur within a few weeks of starting St John 's wort. Clinical evidence A marked drop in ciclosporin blood levels was identified in one kidney transplant recipient as being due to the addition of St John 's wort extract 300 mg three times daily. When the St John 's wort was stopped the ciclosporin levels rose. The authors of this reportidentified another 35 kidney and 10 liver transplant recipients whoseciclosporin levels had dropped by an average of 49% (range 30 to64%) after starting St John' s wort. Two of them had rejection episodes. 1,2In addition, subtherapeutic ciclosporin levels in 7 kidney transplant recipients,3-7one liver transplant recipient,8and 6 heart transplant recipients9-11have been attributed to self-medication with St John 's wort. Acute graft rejection episodes occurred in 7 cases,3,5,7-9,11 and one recipient subsequently developed chronic rejection, requiring a return to dialysis.5Another case of subther- apeutic ciclosporin levels occurred in a kidney transplant recipientduring the concurrent use of a herbal tea containing St John 's wort. The recipient's levels remained subtherapeutic despite a ciclosporindose increase from 150 to 250 mg daily. The levels recovered within5 days of stopping the herbal tea and the ciclosporin dose was reduced to 175 mg daily. 12 These case reports are supported by a small study in which 11 renal transplant recipients, with stable dose requirements for ciclosporin, were given St John 's wort extract ( Jarsin 300 ) 600 mg daily for 14 days. Pharmacokinetic changes were noted 3 days afterthe St John' s wort was added. By day 10 the ciclosporin dose had to be increased from an average of 2.7 to 4.2 mg/kg daily in an attempt to keep ciclosporin levels within the therapeutic range. Two weeks after the St John 's wort was stopped, only 3 patients had been366 St John' s wort Ssuccessfully re-stabilised on their itionally, the pharmacokinetics of various ciclosporin metaboliteswere substantially altered. 13 Another study in 10 kidney transplant recipients stable taking ciclosporin found that the content of hyperforin in the St John 's wort affected the extent of the interaction with ciclosporin. In patientstaking St John 's wort with a high hyperforin content (hyperforin 7 mg, hypericin 0.45 mg) the reduction in the AUC 0-12of ciclosporin was 45% greater than that in patients taking St John 's wort with a low hyperforin content (hyperforin 0.1 mg, hypericin0.45 mg). The maximum blood ciclosporin level and the trough ciclosporin level were also reduced by 36% and 45%, respectively, in the patients taking the higher hyperforin-containing St John 's wort preparation, when compared with the patients taking the preparationwith a lower hyperforin content. The patients taking the high-hyperforin preparation required a mean ciclosporin dose increase of65% whereas the patients taking the low-hyperforin preparation didnot require any ciclosporin dose alterations. 14 Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism St John' s wort is a known inducer of the isoenzyme CYP3A4 by metabolised. Concur- rent use therefore reduces ciclosporin levels. It has also been suggested that St John 's wort affects ciclosporin reabsorption by inducing the drug transporter protein, P-glycoprotein, in the intestine.9,13 Importance and management An established and clinically important interaction. The incidence is not known, but all patients taking ciclosporin should avoid St John 's wort because of the potential severity of this interaction. Transplant rejection can develop within 3 to 4 weeks. It is possible to accommodate this interaction by increasing the ciclosporin dosage11 (possibly about doubled) but this raises the costs of an alreadyexpensive drug. Also, the varying content of natural products wouldmake this hard to monitor. The advice of the CSM in the UK is thatpatients receiving ciclosporin should avoid or stop taking St John 's wort. In the latter situation, the ciclosporin blood levels should bewell monitored and the dosage adjusted as necessary. 15The study described above suggests that increased monitoring will be neededfor at least 2 weeks after the St John 's wort is stopped. 13 Note that St John's wort does not appear to interfere with laboratory assays for ciclosporin, see St John 's wort + Laboratory tests, page 372. 1.

St John's wort + Cimetidine Cimetidine does not significantly alter the metabolism of the constituents of St John 's wort, hypericin and pseudohypericin. Clinical evidence A placebo-controlled study in healthy subjects taking St John 's wort (LI160, Lichtwer Pharma ) 300 mg three times daily found that, apart from a modest 25% increase in the AUC of pseudohypericin, cimetidine 1 g daily (in divided doses) did not significantly affect thepharmacokinetics of either the hypericin or the pseudohypericinconstituents of St John' s wort. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Cimetidine is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. This study suggests that St John 's wort is not significantly metabolised by these isoenzymes. Importance and management The available evidence suggests that cimetidine is unlikely to affect the dose requirements of St John 's wort. 1.

Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2004) 60, 617 -22. St John's wort + Dextromethorphan St John 's wort does not affect the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan or debrisoquine. Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, St John 's wort ( LI160, Lichtwer Pharma , 0.12 to 0.3% hypericin) 300 mg three times daily was taken for 16 days with a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan on day 14. There was no consistent change in the urinary dextro-methorphan to dextrorphan metabolic ratio: 6 subjects had anincrease in the production of dextrorphan while the other 6 subjects had a reduction in dextrorphan production. This finding was within the normal inter-patient variation in dextromethorphan metabolism. 1 Similar findings were reported in another study in 16 healthysubjects given a single 25-mg dose of dextromethorphan on the lastday of a 14-day course of St John' s wort ( Jarsin ; 900 micrograms of hypericin )300 mg three times daily. 2Similarly, the metabolism of dextromethorphan was not significantly affected by St John' s wort when 12 healthy subjects were given a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan after 14 days of St John 's wort ( Jarsin, Lichtwer Pharma ) 300 mg three times daily.3In yet another study in 12 healthy subjects, St John' s wort 300 mg three times daily for 14 days had no significant effect on the urinary excretion of a single 30-mg oral dose of dextromethorphan either after one day or after 2 weeksof use. The St John 's wort product used was from Sundown Herbals and provided about 33 mg of hyperforin daily. 4 Three further studies found that St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily (containing up to 24 mg of hyperforin) for 14 or 28 days had noSt John' s wort 367 Sclinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 5-mg dose of debrisoquine.5-7 Experimental evidence Anin vitro study8found St John's wort extract ( Hypericum Stada ) inhibited the metabolism of dextromethorphan when as a probe substrate for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6. Mechanism St John's wort taken as a multiple-dose regimen does not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on the metabolism of dextromethor- phan or debrisoquine, both of which are used as substrates to assess the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6. Inhibitionof CYP2D6, seen in the single dose in vitro study, is therefore not expected to be clinically relevant. Importance and management St John 's wort is unlikely to interact with dextromethorphan to a clinically relevant extent. Dextromethorphan and debrisoquine are used as a probe drugs for CYP2D6 activity, and therefore theseresults also suggest that a pharmacokinetic interaction as a result ofthis mechanism between St John 's wort and other CYP2D6 substrates is unlikely. 1.

St John's wort + Digoxin Digoxin toxicity occurred in a patient taking digoxin when he stopped taking St John 's wort. There is good evidence that some preparations of St John 's wort can reduce the levels of digoxin by about one-quarter to one-third. Clinical evidence An 80-year-old man taking long-term digoxin and St John 's wort herbal tea (2 litres daily) developed symptoms of digoxin toxicity (nodal bradycardia of 36 bpm and bigeminy) when he stopped takingthe herbal tea. 1 In a study 13 healthy subjects were given digoxin for 5 days until steady state had been achieved, and then St John 's wort extract ( LI 160,Lichtwer Pharma ) 300 mg three times daily for a further 10 days. The AUC and trough level of digoxin decreased by 28%and 37%, respectively. When compared with a parallel group of 12 subjects taking digoxin and placebo, the St John 's wort group had 26.3% lower maximum plasma digoxin levels, 33.3% lower trough digoxin levels and a 25% lower AUC. 2 In another study, 8 healthy subjects pretreated with St John 's wort 300 mg 3 times daily for 14 days were given a single 500-microgramdose of digoxin. St John 's wort decreased the AUC 0-7of digoxin by 18%.3 Another study in 18 healthy subjects found that St John 's wort 300 mg 3 times daily (Nature 'sW a y , containing a daily dose of24 mg of hyperforin) for 14 days reduced the maximum levels andAUC 0-24of a single 250-microgram dose of digoxin by 36% and 23%, respectively. These findings were comparable to rifampicin (an established P-glycoprotein inducer) 600 mg daily for 7 days. No significant adverse effects were reported.4 In a further randomised placebo-controlled study, 93 healthy subjects were given digoxin alone for 7 days and then with one often St John 's wort preparations for 14 days. The extract used in the earlier study ( LI 160 ,Jarsin 300 ,Lichtwer Pharma ) 300 mg three times daily similarly reduced the digoxin AUC, peak and troughplasma levels by 25%, 37%, and 19%, respectively. Comparable results were found with hypericum powder containing similar amounts of hyperforin (about 21 mg daily), while hypericum powderwith half the hyperforin content (about 10 mg daily) reduced theAUC, peak and trough plasma levels by about 18%, 21% and 13%,respectively. Some St John' s wort products, including tea, juice, oil extract and powder with low-dose hyperforin (all 5 mg daily or less),did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. 5 Similarly, a further study in 28 healthy subjects found no statisticallysignificant change in digoxin pharmacokinetics when another low-hyperforin (about 3.5 mg daily) St John 's wort extract ( Esbericum ) 120 mg was given twice daily for 11 days to patients who hadreceived a digoxin loading dose of 750 micrograms daily for 2 daysbefore starting St John' s wort, and then received digoxin 250 micrograms daily each day during the study. 6 Experimental evidence In a study using human cell lines, St John 's wort and hyperforin, a major active constituent, were found to induce P-glycoprotein transport of digoxin out of the cells in a reversible manner, which was comparable to rifampicin, a known inducer of P-glycoprotein.When treated with hypericin, another active constituent of St John 's wort, the transport of digoxin out of the cells was not increased. 7 Mechanism St John 's wort, and specifically hyperforin, a major active constitu- ent, has been shown to increase the activity of the P-glycoprotein drug transporter protein in the intestines, which reduces theabsorption of digoxin. 2-4,7 Importance and management Information seems to be limited to these reports, but the interaction would appear to be established. The extent of the interaction maydepend on the St John 's wort preparation involved and dose used and seems to be correlated with the dose of hyperforin. 4-7Reductions in serum digoxin levels of the size seen with LI 160 could diminish the control of arrhythmias or heart failure. Digoxin serum levelsshould therefore be closely monitored if St John 's wort is either started or stopped, and appropriate dosage adjustments made ifnecessary. The recommendation of the CSM in the UK is that StJohn 's wort should not be used by patients taking digoxin. 8 Note that St John 's wort does not appear to interfere with various immunoassays used for therapeutic drug monitoring of digoxin, seeSt John' s wort + Laboratory tests, page Bigeminija Bauer S, Maurer A, Langheinrich M, Roots I.

St John's wort + Eplerenone St John 's wort slightly decreases the AUC of eplerenone. Clinical evidence St John 's wort caused a small 30% decrease in the AUC of a single 100-mg dose of eplerenone.1,2 Experimental evidenceNo relevant data found. is the P450 isoenzyme inducers of this isoenzyme, such as StJohn 's wort, would be expected to decrease its levels. Importance and management Because of the possibility of decreased efficacy of eplerenone, the UK manufacturers do not recommend the concurrent use of potentCYP3A4 inducers with eplerenone and they specifically name StJohn 's wort. 1However, it is unlikely that the decrease seen with St John 's wort is clinically relevant. Further study is needed to demonstrate the clinical significance. 1. Inspra (Eplerenone). Pfizer Ltd. UK Summary of product characteristics, April 2007. 2. Inspra (Eplerenone). Pfizer Inc.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In vitro studies suggest that hypericin, a component of St John 's wort, may antagonise the effects of etoposide. It may also stimulate the hepatic metabolism of etoposide by the cytochrome P450isoenzyme inducers of this isoenzyme, such as StJohn 's wort, would be expected to decrease its levels. Importance and management Information is very limited but it seems that it would be prudent to avoid St John 's wort in patients taking etoposide or related drugs. More study is needed. 1.

St John's wort + Fexofenadine Pretreatment with St John 's wort had no clinically relevant effect on the plasma levels of single-dose fexofenadine in one study, but markedly reduced fexofenadine levels in two others.Clinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, a single 900-mg dose of St John 's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) increased the maximum plasma level and AUC of a single 60-mg dose of fexofenadine by 45% and 31%, respectively. Conversely, St John' s wort 300 mg three times daily for 14 days caused a slight 5 to 10% decrease in the maximum level and AUC ofa single dose of fexofenadine 60 mg in the same subjects. 1In contrast, in another study, 12 days of pretreatment with St John 's wort increased the oral clearance of a single dose of fexofenadine byabout 1.6-fold in healthy subjects. 2Similarly, a study in 30 healthy subjects found that 10 days of pretreatment with St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily almost doubled the oral clearance of asingle 60-mg dose of fexofenadine. 3 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism In these studies St John' s wort was thought to be interacting via its effects on P-glycoprotein. Importance and management The findings from these multiple-dose studies suggest that St John 's wort either has no clinically relevant effect on fexofenadine, or a decrease occurs that is possibly clinically important. It may beprudent to monitor closely for signs of reduced fexofenadineefficacy in a patient taking regular St John 's wort and, if this is the case, consider St John 's wort as a possible cause. Further study is needed. 1. Wang Z, Hamman MA, Huang S-M, Lesko LJ, Hall SD. Effect of St John 's wort on the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine. Clin Pharmacol Ther (2002) 71, 414 -20. 2.

St John's wort + Food; Tyramine-rich An isolated report describes a patient taking St John 's wort who experienced a hypertensive crisis after consuming tyramine-rich food and drink. Clinical evidence A man who had taken a St John 's wort supplement for 7 days (preparation and dose not stated) was admitted to hospital with confusion and disorientation. He was unable to recall events aftereating aged cheeses and pouring a glass of red wine 8 hours earlier.On examination he had a pulse rate of 115 bpm, a respiratory rate of16 breaths per minute and his blood pressure was 210/140 mmHg. He was treated with intravenous phentolamine and oral labetalol and his blood pressure decreased to 160/100 mmHg after 2 hours and thedelirium also resolved. Extensive laboratory investigations did notfind any cause for the hypertension and delirium. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It was suggested that the time scale of starting to regularly take St John 's wort and the onset of delirium and hypertension after the consumption of tyramine-rich food and drink was suggestive ofhypertension associated with MAOIs. Normally any ingestedtyramine is rapidly metabolised by the enzyme monoamine oxidasein the gut wall and liver before it reaches the general circulation. However, if the activity of the enzyme at these sites is inhibited (by the presence of an MAOI), any tyramine passes freely into theSt John' s wort 369 Scirculation, causing not just a rise in blood pressure, but a highly exaggerated rise due to the release from the adrenergic neurones ofthe large amounts of noradrenaline that accumulate there during inhibition of MAO. 2Although St John 's wort is a potent inhibitor of MAO, this effect has not been demonstrated at recommended doses. It was concluded that the hypertensive crisis in this patient may havebeen mediated by MAO inhibition, but there was also a possibility ofanother, as yet unknown, pharmacological action of St John 's wort being involved. 1 Importance and management Given the widespread use of St John 's wort, this case would seem to be unusual, and there is currently little grounds for suggesting any dietary restriction in those taking St John 's wort. 1.

St John's wort + Herbal medicines For a case report describing delirium following the use of St John 's wort, valerian and loperamide, see under St John 's wort + Loperamide, page 373. St John's wort + Hormonal contraceptives St John 's wort may affect the pharmacokinetics of desogestrel, ethinylestradiol and norethisterone. Both breakthrough bleeding and, more rarely, combined oral contraceptive failure have beenreported in women taking St John 's wort. Two cases describe the failure of emergency hormonal contraception, which wasattributed to the use of St John 's wort. Clinical evidence (a) Combined hormonal contraceptives A study in 17 healthy women taking ethinylestradiol /desoges- trel20/150 micrograms daily found that St John' s wort (300 mg twice or three times daily) did not affect the AUC or maximum levels of ethinylestradiol . However, the AUC and maximum levels of the active metabolite of desogestrel were significantly decreased by about 40% and 20%, respectively. There was no evidence thatovulation occurred. However, the frequency of breakthroughbleeding increased significantly from 35% to around 80%, whichmay affect compliance. 1Another study in 12 healthy women taking ethinylestradiol /norethisterone 35 micrograms/1 mg ( Ortho-Novum) found that St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily for 8 weeks increased the oral clearance of norethisterone and reduced the half- life of ethinylestradiol, but the serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were unaffected. However, of more importance, wasthe increase in breakthrough bleeding, which the authors state as amajor cause of patients stopping hormonal contraceptives. 2A further study in 16 subjects also found reductions in the levels of low-dose ethinylestradiol /norethisterone 20 micrograms/1 mg. Furthermore, they found increased progesterone levels of more than 3 nanog-rams/mL (an indication that ovulation occurred) in 3 patients whoalso took St John 's wort compared with one subject who took placebo. Breakthrough bleeding was also increased. 3In a secondary analysis of this study,4the anti-androgenic effects of ethinylestra- diol/norethisterone , utilised in the treatment of hirsutism and acne, were not significantly affected by St John 's wort. The Adverse Drug Reactions Database of the Swedish Medical Products Agency has on record 2 cases of pregnancy due to thefailure of a combined oral contraceptive, which was attributed to theuse of products containing St John 's wort ( Esbericum andKira). One woman was taking ethinylestradiol andnorethisterone and the other was taking ethinylestradiol andlevonorgestrel .5This follows an earlier report from the Swedish Medical Products Agency of8 cases of breakthrough bleeding in women aged 23 to 31 takinglong-term oral contraceptives and St John 's wort. Breakthrough bleeding occurred within about a week of starting St John 's wort in 5 of the cases, and was known to have resolved in 3 cases when the StJohn 's wort was stopped. 6The CSM in the UK has on record a further 7 cases of pregnancy in women taking St John 's wort and oral contraceptives in the two-year period from February 2000 toFebruary 2002. 7Another earlier brief report describes 3 women taking a combined oral contraceptive ( ethinylestradiol /desogestrel 30/150 micrograms) who developed breakthrough bleeding one -week (2 cases) and 3 months (1 case) after starting to take St John 's wort. 8A single case of pregnancy has also been reported in a patient taking St John 's wort with ethinylestradiol /dienogest (Valette).9The German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices hasreceived a total of 8 case reports of ineffective contraception with StJohn 's wort. 10 In contrast, in a study, 16 healthy women took ethinylestradiol / desogestrel 20/150 micrograms daily on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle, and an extract of St John 's wort with a low hyperforin content of 650 micrograms, (Ze117, standardised to 0.2% hypericin), 250 mgtwice daily on days 7 to 21. The plasma levels of ethinylestradiol and the active metabolite of desogestrel were not significantly altered by St John 's wort. None of the women experienced any breakthrough bleeding or spotting, and measurements of plasmahormone levels indicated that the contraceptive efficacy wasunchanged. 11 (b) Emergency hormonal contraceptives The CSM in the UK has received reports of 2 women taking St John 's wort who became pregnant despite taking emergency hormonal contraception . One of them was also taking an oral contraceptive.7 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It is believed that St John 's wort can induce the metabolism of the contraceptive steroids by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, thereby reducing their serum levels and their effects.6,8,12This can lead to breakthrough bleeding and, in some cases, contraceptivefailure. This is consistent with the way that St John 's wort appears to lower the serum levels of some other drugs. Note that, althoughhyperforin is the most likely constituent responsible for enzymeinduction (supported by the study that found no interaction with alow-hyperforin preparation), others may contribute and the levels ofindividual constituents can vary between different preparations ofthe herb. Importance and management Information appears to be limited to these reports but the interaction between hormonal contraceptives and St John 's wort appears to be established. Its incidence is not known but the evidence so farsuggests that breakthrough bleeding may be a problem, althoughpregnancy resulting from this interaction appears to be uncommon.Only two cases of emergency hormonal contraceptive failureattributed to an interaction with St John' s wort have so far been reported, but the effects of any interaction here would be verydifficult to assess. Since it is not known who is particularly likely tobe at risk, the recommendation of the CSM/MCA and the Faculty ofFamily Planning and Reproductive Health Care (FFPRHC) in theUK 12,13is that women taking oral contraceptives (both combined andprogestogen-only pills ) should either avoid St John 's wort or they should use an additional form of contraception. The FFPRHC Clinical Effectiveness Unit is in agreement with the CSM advice but recommends that, if St John 's wort must be continued, the following370 St John' s wort Sgeneral guidelines13for the use of liver enzyme inducers with hormonal contraceptives should be followed: .Women taking combined oral contraceptives should use an ethinylestradiol dose of at least 50 micrograms daily. The dose may be increased further above 50 micrograms if breakthrough bleeding occurs. Omitting or reducing the pill-free interval has notbeen shown to reduce the risk of ovulation with liver enzymeinducers. Additional non-hormonal methods of contraception,such as condoms, should also be used by patients using combinedhormonal contraceptives, both when taking the liver enzymeinducers and for at least 4 weeks after stopping the drug.Alternatives to all forms of combined hormonal contraceptives should be considered with long-term use of liver enzyme inducers. .The combined contraceptive patch may be continued in the usual manner. Additional, non-hormonal methods of contraception, such as condoms, should also be used by patients using thecombined contraceptive patch, both when taking the liver enzymeinducers and for at least 4 weeks after stopping the drug. Usingmore than one patch is not recommended. .The progestogen-only oral contraceptive is not recommended for use with liver enzyme inducers. Alternative methods of contra- ception are advised. .The progestogen-only implant may be continued with short courses of enzyme inducers. Additional non-hormonal methods of contraception, such as condoms, should also be used by patientsusing the progestogen-only implant, both when taking the liverenzyme inducers and for at least 4 weeks after stopping the drug.Alternatives to the progestogen-only implant should be con-sidered with long-term use of liver enzyme inducers. .The effectiveness of both combined and the progestogen-only emergency hormonal contraceptive will be reduced in women taking liver enzyme inducers. The FFPRHC Clinical Effective-ness Unit states that there appears to be no good evidence on howto manage the interaction between emergency hormonal contra-ception and enzyme inducers such as St John 's wort, but current clinical practice is to increase the contraceptive dose by approxi-mately 50%. 13The British National Formulary recommends giving a single 3-mg dose of levonorgestrel , although this is unlicensed.14A copper intrauterine device (IUD) may also be used as an effective alternative.13In the UK it is possible to buy the progestogen-only emergency hormonal contraception without aprescription; however, it has been advised that patients takingenzyme inducers should not be supplied the emergency hormonalcontraceptive but should be referred to a doctor or family planningservice. 13,15Given the potential consequences of an unwanted pregnancy, these seem sensible precautions. .The depot progestogen-only injection ,copper andlevonorgestrel- releasing IUDs do not appear to be affected by enzyme-inducing drugs, such as St John' s wort, and may be used as alternative contraceptive methods, particularly for women requiring hormo-nal contraception who are likely to be taking the enzyme inducerin the long term, as these are unaffected by liver enzyme inducers. Although the considerable worldwide popularity of St John 's wort is fairly recent, it is currently the most widely used antidepressant inGermany and has been used for very many years in both Germanyand Austria. Yet, there seems to be no published evidence that oralcontraceptive failure in those countries is more frequent thananywhere else. This would seem to confirm that contraceptive failureleading to pregnancy occurring as a result of this interaction is veryuncommon, or perhaps that it has failed to be identified as a possiblecause. The anti-androgenic effects of ethinylestradiol/norethisterone, utilised in the treatment of hirsutism and acne, do not appear to besignificantly affected by St John 's wort. However, as this was a small study, it may be prudent to still monitor the effectiveness of thecombined hormonal contraceptive for this indication until furtherevidence is available.1.

St John's wort + Ibuprofen St John 's wort does not affect the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen. Clinical evidence Eight healthy male subjects were given an oral dose of ibuprofen 400 mg before, and at the end of, a 21-day course of St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily. The pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen wereunaffected by St John 's wort. The St John 's wort extract was standardised to contain hypericin (probably 0.3%) and a minimum of 4% hyperforin. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism As ibuprofen is a substrate for the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8, the authors of the study suggest that the lack of interaction is evidence that St John 's wort has no significant effects on these isoenzymes.1Minor or no significant effects on pharmacokinetics have similarly been reported for rosiglitazone, a substrate for CYP2C8, and gliclazide and tolbutamide, both ofwhich are substrates for CYP2C9. See St John 's wort + Antidiabetics, page 362. Importance and management St John 's wort does not appear to interact with ibuprofen and therefore no special precautions seem necessary on concurrent use. 1. Bell EC, Ravis WR, Lloyd KB, Stokes TJ. Effects of St. John 's wort supplementation on ibuprofen pharmacokinetics. Ann Pharmacother (2007) 41, 229 -34. St John's wort + Imatinib St John 's serum imatinib levels.St John' s wort 371 SClinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of imatinib was determined before, and on day 12, oftwo weeks of treatment with St John' s wort extract (Kira [ LI 160 ], Lichtwer Pharma ) 300 mg three times daily. The AUC and maximum plasma level of imatinib was decreased by 30% and15%, respectively. Imatinib clearance was increased by 43% and itshalf-life was decreased from 12.8 to 9 hours. 1Similar results were found in another study.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism St John' s wort induces intestinal CYP3A4 and it therefore also reduces imatinib levels. Importance and management This study suggests that St John 's wort may modestly reduce the exposure to imatinib, which could result in a reduction in its efficacy. The manufacturers suggest that concurrent use of imatinib and potent enzyme-inducing drugs should be avoided.3,4St John 's wort has smaller effects than other known CYP3A4 inducers, but,nevertheless, some suggested that concurrent use should also beavoided. 1However, if this is not possible it would be prudent to monitor the outcome of concurrent use closely, and increase theimatinib dose as necessary. pharmacokinetics.

Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study St John 's wort decreased the plasma levels of the active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, by 42%. Myelosuppression leucocyte and neutrophil counts decreased by 56% and 63%, respectively, but in the presence of St John 's wort the decreases were only 8.6% and 4.3%, respectively. In this study, irinotecan was givenas a single 350-mg/m2intravenous dose every 3 weeks, and during one cycle a St John' s wort preparation was given three times daily, beginning 14 days before and stopping 4 days after the irinotecan.1 Experimental evidence In an experimental study in rats, St John's wort 400 mg/kg given daily for 14 days reduced the maximum levels of irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38, by 39.5% and 38.9%, respectively. TheAUC of SN-38 was also reduced by 26.3%. 2 Mechanism St John' s wort induces the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, which are both involved in the metabolism of irinotecan. The evidence suggests that St John 's wort increases the metabolism of irinotecan to an unknown inactive metabolite, rather than the active SN-38, thereby reducing its effects.1 Importance and management The evidence appears to be limited. Irinotecan has a narrow therapeutic range and, as irinotecan is a prodrug that is metabolised to its active metabolite SN-38, the lower levels of SN-38 suggest that its activity will be reduced in the presence of St John 's wort. Itwould therefore seem sensible to warn patients who are about toreceive irinotecan to avoid St John 's wort. It seems likely that topotecan , a related drug that is also a substrate for CYP3A4, will be similarly affected, but evidence for this is currently lacking. 1.

Clinical evidence Twelve healthy subjects were given a single oral dose of ivabradine 10 mg 24 hours before St John 's wort ( Jarsin tablets) 300 mg three times daily was given for 14 days. On day 16, they were givena further dose of ivabradine 10 mg with a single 300-mg dose of StJohn 's wort. The maximum levels and AUC of ivabradine were reduced by more than half by St John' s wort. The maximum levels and AUC of its active metabolite were reduced by 25% and 32%,respectively. No adverse effects were reported, and the heart rate and blood pressure remained unchanged. 1Similar findings are also reported by the manufacturers of ivabradine.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism St John' s wort is a known inducer of the isoenzyme CYP3A4, by which ivabradine is metabolised. use therefore increases the metabolism of ivabradine, whichresults in a reduction in its plasma levels, and a potential reduction ineffects. Importance and management Evidence is limited to the study above and, despite the lack of change in pharmacodynamic effects seen in this study, the pharmacokinetic changes may be significant to affect individualpatients. Monitor concurrent use for ivabradine efficacy and adjustthe dose as necessary. Remember to re-adjust the dose of ivabradineif concurrent use of these drugs is stopped. The UK manufacturersuggests that the use of St John 's wort should be restricted in patients taking ivabradine. 2 1. Portol\u00e9s A, Terleira A, Calvo A, in -94. 2.

St John's wort + Laboratory tests St John 's wort does not interfere with in vitro interactions found. Experimental evidence Inin vitro experiments, St John's wort added to serum samples did not interfere with a fluorescence with a serum sample microparticle enzyme372 St John' s wort digoxin , or other MEIA analysis of tacrolimus levels were also not affected by the addition of St John 's wort.1 Mechanism No mechanism expected. Importance and management St John 's wort does not appear to interfere with various immunoassays used for therapeutic drug monitoring Tso G, Szelei-Stevens K.

St John's wort + Lithium A brief report describes mania in a patient taking lithium whoalso took St John 's wort. Clinical evidence A search of Health Canada 's database of spontaneous adverse reactions identified one case in which St John 's wort was suspected of inducing mania in a patient also taking lithium. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown, although it seems likely that the symptoms could be due to the effects of both lithium and St John 's wort on serotonin. Importance and management No general conclusions can be drawn from this case as no further details were given. 1. Griffiths J, Jordan S, Pilan K. Natural health products and adverse reactions. Can Adverse React News (2004) 14, 2 -3. St John's wort + Loperamide A case report describes delirium in a woman taking St John 's wort and valerian root who also took loperamide. Clinical evidence A 39-year-old woman who had been taking two tablets of St John 's wort with valerian root daily for 6 months (exact products and doses not specified) was hospitalised after becoming disorientated, agitated and confused. The patient had also recently started loperamide fordiarrhoea prior to admission. The delirium subsided within two daysof stopping these drugs. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unclear. A MAOI-induced reaction caused by the combination of St John 's wort and loperamide was suggested as a possible cause for the delirium. However, an interaction between St John 's wort and valerian, or valerian and loperamide, cannot be ruled out.1 Importance and management This appears to be the only report of delirium associated with thecombination of St John's wort, valerian and loperamide. Its general relevance is therefore unclear. 1. Khawaja IS, Marotta RF, Lippmann S. Herbal medicines as a factor in delirium. Psychiatr Serv (1999) 50, 969 -70. St John's wort + Methylphenidate St John 's wort may decrease the efficacy of methylphenidate in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Clinical evidence A 22-year-old man who had been successfully treated with methylphenidate 20 mg daily for attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD) for 6 months started to take St John 's wort 600 mg daily. Over the next 4 months the efficacy of the methylphenidate decreased, but, 3 weeks after the St John 's wort was stopped, the methylphenidate became more effective. No adverse effects were seen during the concurrent use of the herbal medicine and drug. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Unknown. Importance and management This is an isolated case report and therefore no general recommen- dations can be made. However, if the efficacy of methylphenidatebecomes reduced, it may be worth questioning the patient about StJohn 's wort use, and giving consideration to stopping the herb. 1. Niederhofer H. St John 's wort may diminish methylphenidate 's efficacy in treating patients suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Med Hypotheses (2007) 68, 1189. St John's wort + Mycophenolate St John 's wort does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate. Clinical evidence In a pharmacokinetic study, 8 stable kidney transplant recipients taking mycophenolate 1 g to 2 g daily and tacrolimus were given 600 mg of St John 's wort extract ( Jarsin 300 ) daily for 14 days. The levels of mycophenolic acid, the main metabolite of mycophenolate, were measured before St John 's wort was started, on day 14, and two weeks after St John' s wort was stopped. The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid were unchanged throughout the study, and no dosage adjustments were needed in any of the 8 patients.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism No mechanism. St John 's wort is an inducer of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. As mycophenolate is not significantly metabolised or transported by these routes, aninteraction would not be expected. Importance and management St John 's wort does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate and therefore no additional precautions seem necessary on concurrent use. 1. Mai I, St\u00f6rmer E, Bauer S, Kr\u00fcger H, Budde K, Roots I. Impact of St John 's wort treatment on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid in renal transplant patients. Nephrol Dial Transplant (2003) 18, 819 -22.St John' s wort 373 SSt John's wort + NNRTIs There is some evidence to suggest that St John 's wort may decrease the levels of nevirapine. Delavirdine and efavirenz would be expected to be similarly affected. Clinical evidence Nevirapine levels, obtained by routine monitoring, were noted to be lower in 5 men who were also taking St John 's wort. Based on a pharmacokinetic modelling analysis, it was estimated that St John 's wort increased the oral clearance of nevirapine by about 35%.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism This finding supports predictions based on the known metabolism of the NNRTIs delavirdine ,efavirenz and nevirapine by the cyto- chrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, of which St John 's wort is a known inducer. Importance and management The interaction between St John 's wort and nevirapine confirms advice issued by the CSM in the UK,2that St John 's wort may decrease blood levels of the NNRTIs with possible loss of HIV suppression. Therefore concurrent use should be avoided. 1. de Maat MMR, Beijnen JH. Drug interaction between St John 's wort and nevirapine. AIDS (2001) 15, 420 -1. 2. Committee on the Safety of Medicines (UK).

St John's wort + Opioids St John 's wort reduces the plasma concentrations of methadone and withdrawal symptoms may occur. Clinical evidence In a study in 4 patients taking methadone , St John 's wort ( Jarsin ) 900 mg daily for 14 to 47 days decreased methadone plasma concentration-to-dose ratios (indicating decreased methadone levels) by 19 to 60%. Two patients reported symptoms that suggested a withdrawal syndrome.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism St John' s wort is metabolised in the liver and induces the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, and so could affect plasma levels of drugs metabolised in this way, such as methadone.1 Importance and management St John 's wort appears to reduce the plasma levels of methadone causing withdrawal symptoms in some patients. Therefore, concur- rent use should be avoided. It may be prudent to follow the sameadvice for other opioids 2that are K, Baumann P, Eap CB. Methadone maintenance treatment and St John 's wort.

Clinical evidence Eight healthy male subjects were given a single oral dose of prednisone 20 mg before, and at the end of, a 28-day course of StJohn 's wort 300 mg three times daily. The pharmacokinetics of prednisone, and its metabolite prednisolone, were not significantly affected by St John's wort. The St John 's wort extract was standardised to contain hypericin 0.3% and a minimum of 4% hyperforin. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It was thought that St John's wort, a known inducer of the cytochrome P450 would increase the of and reduce their levels. Whileprednisone and prednisolone are substrates of CYP3A4, it is not amajor metabolic pathway as they have been shown to be relativelyunaffected by potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in healthy subjects. Importance and management St John's wort does not appear to induce the metabolism of a single dose of prednisone, or its metabolite prednisolone, in healthy malesubjects; however, further study is needed to clarify significance ofthis in patients receiving long-term prednisone. 1. Bell EC, Ravis WR, Chan HM, Lin Y-J. Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between St. John 's wort and prednisone. Ann Pharmacother (2007) 41, 1819- 24. St John's wort + Procainamide The interaction between St John 's wort and procainamide is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in mice, a single dose of St John 's wort extract significantly raised the bioavailability of procainamide 100 mg/kg for a period of up to 4 hours. A trend towards an increase in procainamide levels was seen in the mice given St John 's wort for 2 weeks, with the procainamide dose given the day after St John 's wort was stopped; however, this was not statistically significant. Other pharmacokinetic parameters remained unaffected by bothsingle-dose and long-term use of St John 's wort. 1 Mechanism Not understood. Importance and management The evidence for any significant effect of St John 's wort on the pharmacokinetics of procainamide is extremely limited and, although the bioavailability of procainamide may have been raisedslightly in mice, its metabolism was unchanged. The clinical significance of this in humans is unknown and further study is needed. St John 's wort also does not interfere with laboratory assays for procainamide, see St John 's wort + Laboratory tests, page 372. 1. Dasgupta A, Hovanetz M, Olsen M, Wells A, Actor JK.

Arch Pathol Lab Med (2007) 131, 1094 -8.374 St John' s wort SSt John's wort + Protease inhibitors St John 's wort causes a marked reduction in the serum levels of indinavir, which may result in HIV treatment failure. Other protease inhibitors, whether used alone or boosted by ritonavir,are predicted to interact similarly. Clinical evidence In a single-drug pharmacokinetic study, 8 healthy subjects were given three 800-mg doses of indinavir on day 1 to achieve steady- state serum levels, and then an 800-mg dose on day 2. For the next14 days they were given St John 's wort extract 300 mg three times daily. Starting on day 16, the indinavir dosing was repeated. It was found that the St John 's wort reduced the mean AUC of indinavir by 54% and decreased the 8-hour indinavir trough serum level by 81%.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Not fully understood, but it seems highly likely that St John 's wort induces the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, thereby increasing the metabolism of indinavir and thereforereducing its levels. Importance and management Direct information seems to be limited to this study, but the interaction would appear to be established. Such a large reduction inthe serum levels of indinavir is likely to result in treatment failuresand the development of viral resistance. Therefore St John 's wort should be avoided. There seems to be no direct information aboutother protease inhibitors, but since they are also metabolised by CYP3A4 it is reasonable to expect that they will be similarly affected by St John' s wort. The FDA in the US has suggested that concurrent use of St John' s wort and protease inhibitors is not recommended. 2Similarly, the CSM in the UK has advised that patients taking protease inhibitors should avoid St John 's wort and that anyone already taking both should stop the St John 's wort and have their HIV RNA viral load measured.3The levels of the protease inhibitors are likely to increase as the induction effects of St John 's wort diminish, usually over one to two weeks.4,5Therefore the dose of the protease inhibitor will probably need adjusting. The US andUK advise against the use of St John 's wort. 1. Piscitelli SC, Burstein AH, Chaitt D, Alfaro RM, Falloon J. Indinavir concentrations and St John 's wort. Lancet (2000) 355, 547 -8. 2.

St John's wort + Proton pump inhibitors St John 's wort induces the metabolism of omeprazole, and this might result in reduced efficacy. Other proton pump inhibitors are likely to be similarly affected.Clinical evidence In a crossover study, 12 healthy subjects (6 of the extensive CYP2C19 metaboliser phenotype and 6 of the poor CYP2C19metaboliser phenotype) were given St John' s wort 300 mg three times daily or placebo for 14 days, followed by a single 20-mg dose of omeprazole on day 15. St John 's wort modestly decreased the AUC of omeprazole in all subjects (by 49% in extensive metabolisers and 41% in poor metabolisers), and also increased the plasma levels of hydroxyomeprazole by 35% in those who were extensive metabolisers. It also markedly increased thelevels of the inactive CYP3A4 sulfone metabolite of omeprazole metabolisers (by 148% and 132%, respectively).1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism St John' s wort increases the metabolism of omeprazole by inducing both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.1 Importance and managementThis appears to be the only study examining the effects of St John 's wort on proton pump inhibitors. However, the reduction seen in the AUC of omeprazole (about 40%) suggest that there is a possibilitythat omeprazole will be less effective in patients taking St John 's wort. As all PPIs are metabolised by CYP2C19 to varying extents, itis likely that the effects of St John 's wort seen in these studies will be similar with other PPIs, although note that rabeprazole is much less dependent on this route of metabolism than other PPIs. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that St John 's wort should be avoided in patients taking PPIs. However, the potentialreduction in the efficacy of the PPI should be borne in mind,particularly where the consequences may be serious, such as inpatients with healing ulcers. 1.

St John 's John's wort + SNRIs Serotonin syndrome has been reported in one patient takingvenlafaxine and St John 's wort. Clinical evidence An interaction between venlafaxine and St John' s wort was reported to the Centre R\u00e9gional de Pharmacovigilance de Marseille involving a 32-year-old man who had been taking venlafaxine 250 mg daily for several months. He started taking St John' s wort at a dose of 200 drops three times daily (usual dose up to 160 drops daily) and onthe third day felt faint and anxious, and had symptoms of diaphoresis, shivering and tachycardia. St John 's wort was stopped and his symptoms resolved in 3 days without altering the dose of venlafaxine .1A search of Health Canada 's database of spontaneous adverse reactions for the period 1998 to 2003 also found one case of suspected serotonin syndrome as a result of an interaction between venlafaxine and St John' s wort.2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism A pharmacodynamic interaction may occur between St John 's wort and venlafaxine because they can both inhibit the reuptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). Serotonin syndrome has been s wort alone, 3and so additive serotonergic effects appear to be the explanation for what occurred in the cases describedhere.St John' s wort 375 SImportance and management Information appears to be limited to these reports. Duloxetine would be expected to interact similarly and the manufacturers of both duloxetine and venlafaxine generally advise caution if they are given with drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems;4-6a similar caution with St John 's wort would be prudent. 1.

St John's wort + SSRIs Cases of severe sedation, mania and serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking St John 's wort with SSRIs. Clinical evidence (a) Fluoxetine For a report of hypomania that occurred when St John' s wort, ginkgo biloba andmelatonin were added to treatment with fluoxetine and buspirone, see St John 's wort + Buspirone, page 365. For a report of serotonin syndrome when eletriptan , fluoxetine and St John 's wort were used together, see St John 's wort + Triptans, page 379. (b) Paroxetine In one report, a woman stopped taking paroxetine 40 mg daily after 8 months, and 10 days later started to take 600 mg of St John 's wort powder daily. No problems occurred until the next night when she took a single 20-mg dose of paroxetine because she thought it might help her sleep. The following day at noon she was found still to be inbed, rousable but incoherent, groggy and slow moving, and almostunable to get out of bed. Two hours later she still complained ofnausea, weakness and fatigue, but her vital signs and mental statuswere normal. Within 24 hours all symptoms had resolved. 1 (c) Sertraline Four elderly patients taking sertraline developed symptoms charac- teristic of serotonin syndrome within 2 to 4 days of also taking StJohn 's wort 300 mg, either two or three times daily. The symptoms included dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, anxiety, confusion,restlessness and irritability. Two of them were treated with oralcyproheptadine 4 mg either two or three times daily, and thesymptoms of all of them resolved within a week. They later resumed treatment with sertraline without problems. 2A search of Health Canada 's database of spontaneous adverse reactions from 1998 to 2003 found two cases of suspected serotonin syndrome as a result of an interaction between sertraline and St John 's wort.3 Mania developed in a 28-year-old man, who continued to take St John 's wort against medical advice while also receiving sertraline 50 mg daily for depression; he was also receiving testosteronereplacement post-orchidectomy. 4 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism A pharmacodynamic interaction may occur between St John 's wort and SSRIs because they can both inhibit the reuptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin).5Serotonin syndrome has been seen with St John 's wort alone,6and so additive serotonergic effectsappear to be the explanation for what occurred in the cases described here. Importance and management Information appears to be limited to these reports, but interactions between SSRIs and St John' s wort would seem to be established. The incidence is not known but it is probably small; neverthelessbecause of the potential severity of the reaction it would seemprudent to avoid concurrent use. The advice of the CSM in the UK isthat St John' s wort should be stopped if patients are taking any SSRI because of the risk of increased serotonergic effects and an increased incidence of adverse reactions. 7 1.

St John's wort + Statins St John 's wort modestly decreases the plasma levels of atorvastatin and simvastatin, but not pravastatin. Clinical evidence In a placebo-controlled, crossover study, 16 healthy subjects took St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily for 14 days. On day 14 simvastatin 10 mg was given to 8 subjects and pravastatin 20 mg was given to the other 8 subjects. St John 's wort did not affect the plasma concentration of pravastatin , but it tended to reduce the simvastatin AUC and significantly reduce the AUC of its active metabolite, simvastatin hydroxyacid, by 62%.1 In a crossover study in 24 patients with hypercholesterolemia taking long-term simvastatin 10 to 40 mg daily (an average dose of 20.8 mg daily), St John 's wort ( Movina ) 300 mg twice daily for 4 weeks significantly raised the levels of total cholesterol from4.56 mmol/L (pre-treatment) to 5.08 mmol/L and LDL-cholesterolfrom 2.72 mmol/L. The authors equate the magni-tude of the increased LDL-cholesterol levels to a halving of theeffects of simvastatin .2 In a similar study by the same authors, 16 patients with hypercholesterolemia taking long-term atorvastatin 10 to 40 mg daily (an average dose of 14.4 mg daily) were given St John 's wort (Movina ) 300 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. St John 's wort signifi- cantly raised the levels of total cholesterol from 4.76 mmol/L. The levels of atorvastatin were not measured in this study. The authors equate the magnitude of the increasedLDL-cholesterol levels to a loss of a third of the effects of atorvastatin . No adverse effects were reported.3 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism The reason for this interaction is unknown, but St John 's wort may reduce the levels of simvastatin and its metabolite, and atorvastatin, by inducing the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 or by having some effect on P-glycoprotein.376 St John' s wort SImportance and management Although the evidence is limited, it appears that St John 's wort may reduce the efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin, which may result in a clinically relevant increase in total cholesterol and LDL levels,depending on the patient 's baseline result and medical history. It may be prudent to consider an interaction if lipid-lowering targets are notmet, and advise the patient to stop taking St John 's wort or adjust the dose of statin, as needed. No significant interaction would be expected with pravastatin as it is not primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, and this was demonstratedin the study above. As fluvastatin and rosuvastatin are not significantly metabolised by CYP3A4, a clinically relevant inter- action would also not be expected. 1.

St John's wort + Tacrolimus St John 's wort decreases tacrolimus levels. Clinical evidence In a clinical study, 10 healthy subjects were given a single 100-microgram/kg dose of tacrolimus alone, or after they took St John 's wort 300 mg three times daily for 14 days. On average St John 's wort decreased the maximum blood level of tacrolimus by 65% and its AUC by 32%. However, the decrease in AUC rangedfrom 15% to 64%, with one patient having a 31% increase in AUC. 1 Similar results have been found in a study in 10 kidney transplantrecipients given St John 's wort ( Jarsin 300 ) 600 mg daily for 2 weeks. In order to achieve target levels, the tacrolimus dose was increased in all patients, from a median of 4.5 mg daily to 8 mg daily. Two weeks after stopping St John 's wort, tacrolimus doses were reduced to a median of 6.5 mg daily, and then to the original dose of4.5 mg daily after about 4 weeks. 2 A case report describes a 65-year-old patient taking tacrolimus following a kidney transplantation. The patient started to take StJohn 's wort ( Neuroplant ) 600 mg daily, and after one month the tacrolimus trough blood levels had dropped from a range of 6 to10 nanograms/mL down to 1.6 nanograms/mL, with an unexpectedimprovement in creatinine levels. When the St John 's wort was stopped, tacrolimus levels and creatinine returned to the previousrange. Subsequently a lower target range of tacrolimus was set. 3 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism St John' s wort induces the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 and affects the transporter protein P-glycoprotein. CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein are involved in the metabolism and clearance oftacrolimus, so an increase in their effects would be expected to resultin a decrease in tacrolimus levels. 1,3 Importance and management Although the evidence currently seems limited to these reports, the interaction between tacrolimus and St John 's wort has been predicted from the pharmacokinetics of these two drugs. Given theunpredictability of the interaction (and the variability in content ofSt John' s wort products) it would seem prudent to avoid St John 's wort in transplant recipients, and possibly other types of patient taking tacrolimus. If St John 's wort is started or stopped, monitor tacrolimus levels closely and adjust the dose accordingly.St John 's wort also does not interfere with laboratory assays for tacrolimus, see St John 's wort + Laboratory tests, page 372. 1.

St John's wort + Talinolol St John 's wort modestly decreases the plasma levels of talinolol. Clinical evidence In a randomised study, a single oral dose of talinolol 50 mg was given to 9 healthy subjects after 12-days of St John's wort ( Jarsin, Lichtwer Pharma ) 900 mg daily. St John's wort was found to reduce the AUC and oral bioavailability of talinolol by about 31% and 25%,respectively. The non-renal clearance of a single dose of talinolol30 mg given as a 30-minute infusion was increased by about 26%.Other pharmacokinetic parameters of both oral and intravenoustalinolol were not significantly affected. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Talinolol is a known substrate for P-glycoprotein. This study found that the levels of intestinal P-glycoprotein in the duodenal biopsysamples of 9 subjects were raised by St John 's wort, leading to a reduction in the absorption of talinolol. Importance and management Information appears to be limited to this study but it is in line with the known effects of St John 's wort on substrates of P-glycoprotein, such as digoxin. See St John's wort + Digoxin, page 368. Themodest decrease in talinolol levels suggests that, in most patients,this interaction is unlikely to be clinically significant. Nevertheless,consider this interaction if blood pressure is difficult to control. 1. Schwarz UI, Hanso H, Oertel R, M, GK, Kim RB, Kirch W. Induction of intestinal P-glycoprotein by St John 's wort reduces the oral bioavailability of talinolol. Clin Pharmacol John's wort + Theophylline A patient needed a marked increase in the dosage of theophyl-line while taking St John 's wort. In contrast, no pharmaco- kinetic interaction was found in a 2-week study in healthysubjects. Clinical evidence A study in 12 healthy subjects found that a standardised preparation of St John' s wort 300 mg (hypericin 0.27%) three times daily for 15 days had no significant effects on the plasma level of a single400-mg oral dose of theophylline. 1 However, an isolated case has been reported of a woman, who had previously been stable for several months taking theophylline300 mg twice daily, but was found to need a marked increase in hertheophylline dosage to 800 mg twice daily to achieve serum levels of9.2 mg/L. Two months previously she had started to take 300 mg of aSt John 's wort supplement (hypericin 0.3%) each day. When she stopped taking the St John 's wort, her serum theophylline levels doubled within one week to 19.6 mg/L and her theophylline dosagewas consequently reduced. This patient was also taking a wholeSt John' s wort 377 Sspectrum of and zafirlukast) and was also a smoker. No changes in the use of these drugs or altered compliance were identified that might have offered an alternative explanation forthe changed theophylline requirements. 2 Experimental evidence In vitro data suggest that hypericin can act as an inducer of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2.2 MechanismUncertain. It has been suggested that treatment with St John' s wort for 15 days was unlikely to induce the isoenzymes sufficiently to cause changes in plasma theophylline, 1and St John's wort is thought to have a rather limited ability to induce CYP1A2. The patient in thecase report had been taking St John' s wort for 2 months, although at a lower dose, therefore differences in duration of treatment may account for the discrepancy. Importance and management Direct information about this apparent interaction between theophyl- line and St John 's wort appears to be limited. Despite the isolated case report of a marked decrease in theophylline levels, nosignificant pharmacokinetic interaction was noted in healthysubjects, and any pharmacokinetic interaction appears likely to be minor. Mechanistic studies suggest a modest interaction at most. Furthermore, most clinically significant interactions with St John 's wort are mediated by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4.However, until further evidence is available, it would be prudent tobe aware of the possibility of an interaction. Patients should bewarned of the possible effects of concurrent use. In 2000, the CSMin the UK recommended that patients taking theophylline should nottake St John 's wort. In those patients already taking the combination, the St John 's wort should be stopped and the theophylline dosage monitored and adjusted if necessary. 3,4However, this guidance was issued before the pharmacokinetic study that suggests that aninteraction is generally unlikely. Note that St John's wort does not appear to interfere with laboratory assays for theophylline, see St John 's wort + Laboratory tests, page 372. 1.

St John's wort + Tibolone An isolated case describes liver damage in a woman taking tibolone and St John 's wort. Clinical evidence A 57-year-old woman who had been taking tibolone 2.5 mg daily for the past 2 years for postmenopausal symptoms, and hydroxychlor- oquine sulfate 200 mg daily for the past 7 years for rheumatoid arthritis, without complaint, was hospitalised for liver damage aftertaking a 2-g infusion of St John 's wort daily for 10 weeks for mild depression. The patient was suffering from fatigue, reduced appetiteand jaundice. Her liver function normalised after about one year oftaking ursodesoxycholic acid 250 mg twice daily. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found.MechanismUnknown. Importance and management The general clinical importance of this isolated report is uncertain. Both tibolone and hydroxychloroquine sulfate have been associated with liver toxicity alone but cases with hydroxychloroquine sulfateare quite rare. Therefore the authors of the report suggest that aninteraction between tibolone and St John's wort was to blame for theliver damage in this case; however, both drugs may cause liverdamage alone. Both tibolone and St John 's wort are widely used long term, which suggests that this interaction is not common. Nevertheless, it may be prudent to be aware of a possible interaction if symptoms of liver toxicity (fatigue, reduced appetite, dark urine)become apparent. 1.

St John's wort + Tricyclic antidepressants The plasma levels of amitriptyline and its active metabolite, nortriptyline, are modestly reduced by St John 's wort. Clinical evidence Twelve depressed patients were given amitriptyline 75 mg twice daily and St John' s wort extract ( Jarsin, Lichtwer Pharma ) 900 mg daily for at least 14 days. The AUC 0-12ofamitriptyline was reduced by about 22% and the AUC of nortriptyline (its metabolite) was reduced by about 41%.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Not fully understood. St John' s wort is known to induce the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, which is a minor route of metabolism of the tricyclic antidepressants. However, thetricyclics are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6, so an effecton CYP3A4 is unlikely to lead to a clinically relevant reduction intheir levels. Induction of P-glycoprotein by St John 's wort may also contribute; however, the extent of its involvement in the transport ofthe tricyclics is unclear. Importance and management The evidence for an interaction is limited to this study, and based on the minor reduction in amitriptyline levels seen, it seems unlikelythat a clinically significant reduction in efficacy would occur. Othertricyclics would be expected to interact similarly. Both the tricyclics and St John 's wort are antidepressants, but whether concurrent use is beneficial or safe is not known, and it wasnot assessed in this study. 1Further study is needed. Note that St John's wort does not appear to interfere with laboratory assays for tricyclics, see St John 's wort + Laboratory tests, page 372. 1.

Decreased plasma levels of amitriptyline and its metabolites on comedication with an extract from St. John 's wort (Hypericum perforatum ).J Clin Psychopharmacol (2002) 22, 46 wort SSt John's wort + Triptans Serotonin syndrome has been reported in a patient taking eletriptan and St John 's wort. Clinical evidence A 28-year-old woman who had been taking fluoxetine 60 mg daily for one year for an eating disorder, and St John's wort (dose and frequency not stated) for one month, suffered a loss of conscious-ness, convulsions and mental confusion after eletriptan 40 mg daily was started 3 days earlier for a recurrent migraine. Previous use of eletriptan andfluoxetine had not resulted in any reported adverse effects. After admission to hospital, the patient developed acuterhabdomyolysis and transient mild acute renal failure. Serotoninsyndrome was diagnosed, all medications were stopped and thesymptoms gradually resolved over 10 days. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Additive serotonergic effects are the likely explanation for the case report above as serotonin syndrome has been reported with both StJohn 's wort 2and with triptans alone. Importance and management The CSM/MCA in the UK note that potentiation of serotonergic effects have been identified between triptans and St John 's wort, leading to an increased risk of adverse effects, and they advise thatpatients taking triptans should not take St John 's wort preparations. 3,4 However, most UK manufacturers of triptans simply warn about thepotential increase in undesirable effects. The possible concern is thatconcurrent use may result in the development of serotonin syndrome. 1. Bonetto N, Santelli L, Battistin L, Cagnin A.

St John's wort + Voriconazole St John 's wort more than halves the AUC of a single dose of voriconazole. Clinical evidence In a study in 17 healthy subjects, a single 400-mg dose of oral voriconazole was given alone and on the first and last day of StJohn 's wort ( Jarsin, Lichtwer Pharma ) 300 mg three times daily for 15 days. Taking St John 's wort for one day had no effect on the voriconazole AUC 0-, but slightly increased the maximum serum level and AUC 0-10by 22%. However, when voriconazole was given on day 15 of treatment with St John' s wort, the AUC of voriconazole was decreased by 59% and there was a 2.4-fold increase in oral clearance.1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism These results suggest that the short-term effect of St John 's wort is to slightly enhance the absorption of voriconazole, whereas the longer- term effect is to induce absorption-limiting transport proteins, suchas P-glycoprotein, and intestinal metabolism via cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP3A4. 1 Importance and management The slight increase in voriconazole absorption with a single dose of St John 's wort is not clinically relevant. However, the reduction in voriconazole levels after 15 days of St John' s wort could impact on clinical efficacy. This suggests that patients requiring voriconazoleshould be asked about current or recent use of St John 's wort, since this may indicate the need to use an increased voriconazole dose, atleast initially. Patients taking voriconazole should be advised not to take St John' s wort. The manufacturers of voriconazole specifically contraindicate concurrent use of St John 's wort. 2 1.

St John's wort + Warfarin and related drugs St John 's wort can cause a moderate reduction in the anticoagulant effects of phenprocoumon and warfarin. Clinical evidence (a) Phenprocoumon In a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 10 healthy John' s wort extract (LI 160, Lichtwer Pharma ) 900 mg daily for 11 days reduced the AUC of a single 12-mg dose ofphenprocoumon by a modest 17.4%. There is also a case report of a75-year-old woman taking phenprocoumon who had a reducedanticoagulant response (a rise in the Quick value) 2 months afterstarting to take St John' s wort. 2 (b) Warfarin In a randomised, crossover study in 12 healthy subjects, one tablet of St John' s wort three times daily for 3 weeks modestly decreased the AUC of both R-andS-warfarin by about 25% after a single 25- mg dose of warfarin taken on day 14. In this study, the brand of StJohn 's wort used was Bioglan tablets, each tablet containing an extract equivalent to 1 g of Hypericum perforatum flowering herb top containing 825 micrograms of hypericin and 12.5 mg ofhyperforin. 3 The Swedish Medical Products Agency received 7 case reports over the 1998 to 1999 period of patients stabilised on warfarin whoshowed decreased INRs when St John' s wort was added. Their INRs fell from the normal therapeutic range of about 2 to 4 to about1.5. Two patients needed warfarin dosage increases of 6.6% and15%, respectively, when St John 's wort was added. The INRs of 4 patients returned to their former values when St John 's wort was stopped. 4 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Uncertain, but it is suggested that the St John 's wort increases the metabolism and clearance of the anticoagulants1,3,4possibly by induction of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, and CYP2C9, as both R- and S-warfarin were affected.3However, note that St John' s wort had no effect on the metabolism of tolbutamide, which is commonly used as a probe substrate forCYP2C9 activity. See St John 's wort + Antidiabetics, page 362. Importance and management Information seems to be limited to these reports, but a modestSt John' s wort 379 Spharmacokinetic interaction is established, which might be clinically important in some patients. It would be prudent to monitor the INRsof patients taking phenprocoumon, warfarin or any other coumarin if they start taking St John 's wort, being alert for the need to slightly raise the anticoagulant dosage. However, note that the advice of the CSM in the UK is that St John 's wort should not be used with warfarin. They note that the degree of induction of warfarinmetabolism is likely to vary because levels of active ingredients mayvary between St John 's wort preparations. If a patient is already taking the combination, they advise checking the INR, stopping theSt John 's wort and then monitoring the INR closely and adjusting the anticoagulant dosage as necessary. 51.

Pharmacopoeias Refined Borage Oil (BP 2009 ); Refined Borage (Starflower) Oil (Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The oil from starflower seeds contains the essential fatty acids of the omega-6 series, linoleic acid (about 30 to 41%) and gamolenic acid (gamma-linolenic acid, about 17 to 27%). Other fatty acids include oleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, palmitic andtheir is thought to possess diuretic, expectorant andanti-inflammatory properties. The main use of starflower comes from its seed oil, which contains none of thehepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in the leaves. The oil is used as an alternative to evening primrose oil, page 179, as a source of gamolenic acid. Infusions of the leaves have traditionally been used for fevers and coughs but it is not recommended that starflower leaves are taken internally, especially if fresh, because they contain small amounts of the hepatotoxic pyrrolizidinealkaloids. The leaves have also been used as an emollientpoultice. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found, but see eveningprimrose oil, page 179 for information on the pharmaco- kinetics of cis-linoleic acid. Interactions overview Evening primrose oil contains linoleic acid and gamolenic acid, which are the main active constituents implicated in its interactions. Starflower oil also contains these constituents,and is therefore expected to interact in the same way. See evening primrose oil, page 179.S 381Tea Link, Thea sinensis L. Note that Green tea (predominantly produced in China and Japan) is produced from steam-treated tea leaves. Black tea or Red tea (predominantly produced in India, Sri Lanka and Kenya) is processed by fermentation and heating, whereas Oolong tea is partially fermented. Pharmacopoeias Powdered Decaffeinated Green Tea Extract ( USP 32 ). Constituents Tea contains caffeine (around 1 to 5%), with minor amounts of other xanthines such as theophylline and theobromine.Tea also contains flavonoids , the content of which varies between green (unfermented) and black (fermented) tea. Green tea appears to contain greater quantities of the flavonol-type flavonoids than black tea. Black tea also contains theaflavins, which are produced during the fermen-tation process. Other flavonols present include quercetin and kaempferol. Oolong tea contains some unique flavones known as oolonghomobisflavins. Tea also contains up to24% tannins. Use and indications The leaf buds and very young leaves of tea are used as astimulant and diuretic, actions that can be attributed to the caffeine content. They are also used as an astringent for gastrointestinal disorders, which may be attributed to thepolyphenols and tannins. Tea is very widely used to make abeverage. Green tea extracts, which are rich in polypheno- lics, are available as supplements. There is also a prescrip- tion-only ointment containing green tea extract(sinecatechins), which is used for the treatment of genitalwarts. 1 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of caffeine are discussed undercaffeine, page 97. Black tea does not appear to affect thecytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, as shown by the lack of effect on the pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen, page 385. Similarly green tea catechins do not appear to affect themetabolism of caffeine, page 384, losartan, page 387, dextromethorphan, page 385, or alprazolam, page 383, suggesting a lack of effect on the isoenzymes CYP1A2,CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in tea, see flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview Tea can contain significant amounts of caffeine, therefore theinteractions of caffeine, page 97, are relevant to tea, unless the product is stated as decaffeinated. Black tea appears to reduce the absorption of iron, whereas green tea appears tohave much smaller, if any, effects. Both black and green tea may cause a modest increase in blood pressure, which may be detrimental to the treatment of hypertension. Tea,particularly green tea catechins, may have some antiplateleteffects, which may be additive to those of conventional antiplatelet drugs. Case reports suggest that tea may reduce the INR in response to warfarin. Green tea extracts do not appear to affect the pharmaco- kinetics of alprazolam, caffeine, ciclosporin, dextromethor- phan, irinotecan have only modest effects on the pharmacokinetics of buspirone, but some of these dataneed confirming in patients. Black tea does not appear tohave a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen. Milk does not appear to affect the absorption of flavonoids or catechins from tea, suggesting that the addition of milkdoes not impair the antioxidant effects of tea. For information on the interactions of individual flavo- noids present in tea, see under flavonoids, page 186. 1. Veregen (Sinecatechins). Doak Dermatologics. US Prescribing information, December 2007.T 382Tea + Alprazolam Green tea extract does not affect the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam. Clinical evidence In a pharmacokinetic study, 10 healthy subjects were given a single 2-mg dose of alprazolam before and after Decaffeinated Super Green Tea Extract 2 capsules twice daily for 14 days. The green tea extract did not affect the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam.1 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence available, experi- mental data have not been sought. Mechanism These studies provide evidence that green tea catechins, at similar1 doses to the amount provided by average green tea consumption, are unlikely to affect the metabolism of drugs by the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP3A4. Importance and management The available data suggest that no clinically relevant pharmaco- kinetic interaction would be expected between green tea andalprazolam. Alprazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmaco- kinetic interaction as a result of this mechanism between green teaand other CYP3A4 substrates is unlikely. For the possible pharmacodynamic interaction between caffeine (a constituent of tea) and benzodiazepines, see Caffeine +Benzodiazepines and related drugs, page 100. Tea can containsignificant amounts of caffeine, and this interaction should beapplied to tea, unless the product is stated to be decaffeinated. 1.

Tea + Antihypertensives Both black and green tea may cause a modest increase in blood pressure, which may be detrimental to the treatment ofhypertension. Clinical evidence There is a possibility that the effect of tea on blood pressure might differ from that of pure caffeine. There are few data on the effect oftea on blood pressure in patients treated with antihypertensives. Onestudy in stable hypertensive patients taking beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers, nitrates and ACE inhibitors reported that 450 mLof black tea (containing approximately 190 mg of caffeine) increased systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg two hours after consumption.This effect was similar to the increase seen with a single dose of 200-mg of caffeine. Drinking 900 mL of black tea daily for 4 weeks had no significant effect on blood pressure. However, the acute effects of tea remained: systolic blood pressure was still increased by5 mmHg two hours after the patients drank 450 mL of black tea .1 There are a number of short-term intervention studies on the effect oftea on blood pressure, mainly in healthy subjects or patients withuntreated mild hypertension. In one meta-analysis of 5 randomised studies of the effect of tea consumption for at least 7 days (median 4 weeks) on blood pressure, tea consumption was associated with nochange in blood pressure, when compared with the control group(although this group took caffeine in two of the studies). 2In one of the studies in this review, the acute increase in blood pressure seen with both green tea and black (fermented )tea30 minutes after consumption was actually higher than that from an equivalent dose of caffeine. However, the increases seen in ambulatory bloodpressure after 7 days of regular consumption of green orblack tea were small and not different to that of caffeine.3In another study by the same research group, the acute effects of black (fermented )tea on blood pressure were not apparent when the tea was taken with ameal (high fat). 4 The only long-term studies are of epidemiological type. In the Nurses Health prospective cohort study I, tea consumption was notassociated with an increased risk of developing hypertension,whereas in the cohort study II, there was a slight trend for increasedrisk of hypertension with increased caffeinated tea intake. 5However, in a cohort study in Taiwan, the risk of developing hypertension wasreduced by regular tea ( green oroolong ) consumption.6Similarly, in a cross-sectional study, tea intake (mostly black (fermented )teawith added milk) was related to lower blood pressure in older women.7 There appear to be very few data on the effect of supplements containing tea extracts on blood pressure. In one study, whichcompared the addition of green tea extract or placebo with a low- energy diet, the green tea extract had no additional benefit on blood pressure over that achieved by modest weight loss.8In a single-dose study, a supplement containing black tea extract (polyphenols and caffeine), guarana extract (caffeine), ginger extract, dill weed extract, rutin and vitamin C ( TeaLean ), there was an average 3.7 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure in the 2 hours afteringestion, but no increase in diastolic blood pressure. 9 Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Acute intake of caffeine raises blood pressure, but some tolerance to this effect might possibly develop with regular consumption. See also Caffeine + Antihypertensives, page 99. Polyphenolics in tea might improve endothelial function, and might therefore lower bloodpressure. Importance and management The evidence presented here is conflicting, and it is not possible to be conclusive about the long-term effect of tea intake (green orblack) on blood pressure. However, any adverse effect appears to bemodest. On acute intake, both green and black (fermented) teas and some herbal supplements (particularly if they contain caffeine) might increase blood pressure, although, from the limited informationabove, these increases appear to be small and not necessarilysustained during long-term intake. Bear this in mind in patients withpoorly controlled hypertension who frequently consume tea,particularly in large quantities. Further study on the effects of teaon antihypertensives is needed. However, note that similar effectsare known to occur with caffeine alone, see Caffeine + Anti- hypertensives, page 99. 1. Duffy N, Swerdloff PL, Frei B, Vita JA.

Clinical evidence (a) Pharmacodynamic effects In studies in healthy medication-free subjects, neither acute 1,2nor chronic3tea consumption of black (fermented )tea(with or without added milk) affected platelet aggregation, whereas two studies did report a reduction in platelet activation with chronic tea intake.2,4 Another study, in 49 patients with known coronary artery disease taking aspirin 325 mg daily, found no evidence that acute or chronic ingestion of black (fermented )teaaffected ADP-induced platelet aggregation.5There appears to be just one clinical study of green tea , which did not find any significant effect on platelet aggregation.6 (b) Pharmacokinetic effects A study in 5 healthy subjects found that 200 mL of tea (at a temperature of 50\u00b0C) increased the rate of absorption of salicylatefrom a single 500-mg dose of aspirin , when compared with water, but the maximum concentration of salicylate was not significantlyaffected. The authors note that this result may have been influencedby the high temperature of the tea and an alkaline pH, both of whichcan increase the dissolution rate of aspirin .7Note that caffeine is known to have a modest effect on the absorption of aspirin , see Caffeine + Aspirin or Diclofenac, page 99. Experimental evidence Green tea catechins have been reported to inhibit platelet aggrega- tion in mice andin vitro , in a dose-dependent manner. Bleeding time was also prolonged in mice, but aPTT, prothrombin time and thrombin time were not affected by green tea catechins added to human plasma. This suggested an antiplatelet rather than an antithrombotic effect.8Another animal study by the same research group found that oral green tea catechins 25 and 50 mg/kg inhibited arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and the production ofthromboxane A 2and prostaglandin D 2.9 Mechanism There is in vitro evidence that flavonoids, and flavanols and procyanidin oligomers in particular, inhibit platelet aggregation,10 and this has been suggested as a mechanism to explain why some epidemiological studies show that a diet high in these substances is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (see alsoFlavonoids + Anticoagulant or Antiplatelet drugs, page 188). Importance and management In general the evidence appears to suggest that black (fermented) tea does not have a clinically relevant effect on platelet aggregation.However, experimental studies using green tea catechins have foundan antiplatelet effect, and this effect may, in theory, be additive tothose of conventional antiplatelet drugs. Concurrent use need not beavoided (indeed combinations of antiplatelet drugs are often prescribed together) but it may be prudent to be aware of the potential for increased bleeding if green tea extracts, particularly inhigh doses, are given with other antiplatelet drugs such as aspirinand clopidogrel . Patients should discuss any episode of prolonged bleeding with a healthcare professional. Modest consumption isunlikely to cause any problems. 1.

Tea + Buspirone Green tea catechins have only modest effects on the pharmaco- kinetics of buspirone. Clinical evidence In a study in 41 healthy subjects, green tea catechin extract 4 capsules daily for 4 weeks caused a minor 21% increase in the AUC of a single 10-mg dose of buspirone. The green tea catechin extract used in this study, Polyphenon E , contained 80 to 98% total catechins, of which 50 to 75% (200 mg) was epigallocatechingallate. It was essentially decaffeinated (0.5% w/w caffeine). 1 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence available, experi- mental data have not been sought. Mechanism These studies provide evidence that green tea catechins (at higher doses than the amount provided by average green tea consumption1) are unlikely to affect the metabolism of drugs principally metabol-ised via cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. Importance and management No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction is expected between decaffeinated green tea and buspirone. However, there is a possible pharmacodynamic interaction between caffeine (a constituent of tea) and benzodiazepines, see Caffeine + Benzodia-zepines and related drugs, page 100. Tea can contain significantamounts of caffeine, and therefore this interaction is relevant to tea,unless the product is stated to be decaffeinated. 1.

Clinical evidence In a study in 41 healthy subjects, 4 capsules of a green tea catechin extract taken daily for 4 weeks had no effect on the metabolism of caffeine to paraxanthine after a single 100-mg dose of caffeine. The green tea catechin extract used in this study, Polyphenon E , contained 80 to 98% total catechins, of which 50 to 75% (200 mg) was epigallocatechin gallate per capsule. decaf- feinated (0.5% w/w caffeine).1384 Tea TExperimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence available, experi- mental data have not been sought. Mechanism This study provides evidence that green tea catechins (at higher1 doses than the amount provided by average green tea consumption) are unlikely to affect the metabolism of drugs principally metabol-ised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP1A2. Importance and management No pharmacokinetic interaction is expected between decaffeinated green tea and caffeine or other CYP1A2 substrates. Note that tea usually contains caffeine, and therefore the interactions of caffeine, page 97, (including caffeine found in other medicines, supplements or foods) are relevant. Excess caffeineconsumption can cause adverse effects, including headache,jitteriness, restlessness and insomnia. Reduce caffeine intake ifproblems develop. 1.

Cancer + Ciclosporin or Tacrolimus Green tea catechins do not appear to affect ciclosporin levels, and may protect against the adverse renal effects of ciclosporin and tacrolimus. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management In a study in rats, epigallocatechin gallate (a green tea catechin ) had no significant effect on ciclosporin levels and also appeared to protect against ciclosporin-induced renal damage.1In another animal study, pre-treatment with green tea polyphenolic extract , followed by the addition of ciclosporin or tacrolimus, blunted the decrease in glomerular filtration rates seen with these drugs.2Similar findings were reported in another animal study with ciclosporin.3 These findings in animals provide limited evidence that green tea supplements are unlikely to interact adversely with ciclosporin or tacrolimus, and might actually be beneficial. However, until clinicaldata are available, it would be unwise for transplant recipients takingthese immunosuppressants to take tea supplements. Usual consump-tion of tea beverages does not appear to be a problem. 1. Mun KC. Effect of epigallocatechin gallate on renal function in cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity.

Clinical evidence In a study in 32 healthy subjects, 4 capsules of a green tea catechin extract taken daily for 4 weeks had no effect on the metabolism of dextromethorphan to dextrorphan after a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan. The green tea catechin extract used in this study, Polyphenon E , contained 80 to 98% total catechins, of which 50 to 75% (200 mg per capsule) was epigallocatechin gallate. It was essentially decaffeinated (0.5% w/w caffeine).1Similar lack of a pharmacokinetic interaction with dextromethorphan) werereported in another study in which 7 subjects received a single 30-mg dose of dextromethorphan before and after Decaffeinated Super Green Tea Extract 2 capsules twice daily for 14 days.2 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism These studies provide evidence that green tea catechins (at similar2 or higher1doses than the amount provided by average green tea consumption) are unlikely to affect the metabolism of dextromethor- phan. Importance and management Evidence from two well-designed clinical studies suggests that green tea does not affect the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan.Dextromethorphan is used as a probe drug for CYP2D6 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter- action as a result of this mechanism between green tea and otherCYP2D6 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Tea + Flurbiprofen Black tea does not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen. Clinical evidence In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, brewed black tea (Lipton Brisk tea) had no effect on the clearance of elimination half-life of flurbiprofen.1 Experimental evidenceAnin vitro study reported that a sample containing brewed black tea 2.5% inhibited the hydroxylation of flurbiprofen by CYP2C9 by 89%.1 Mechanism These studies provide evidence that black (fermented) tea is unlikely to affect the metabolism of flurbiprofen. Importance and management Although experimental studies1suggested that black tea may inhibit the metabolism of flurbiprofen, the study in healthy subjects suggests that any effect is not clinically relevant. No pharmaco- kinetic interaction is therefore expected between black (fermented) tea and flurbiprofen. Flurbiprofen can be used as a probe drug forCYP2C9 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that apharmacokinetic interaction as a result of this mechanism betweenblack tea and other CYP2C9 substrates is unlikely. 1.

Tea + Food Milk does not appear to affect the absorption of flavonoids or catechins from tea, suggesting that the addition of milk does not impair the antioxidant effects of tea.Tea 385 TClinical evidence In a study in 12 healthy subjects, blood levels of catechins did not differ when black (fermented )teawas taken with the addition of milk (100 mL semi-skimmed plus water 500 mL with 3 g of instanttea) compared with no milk (3 g instant tea with water 600 mL). 1 Similarly, in another study, plasma levels of the flavonoids quercetinand kaempferol did not differ when black (fermented )teawas drunk alone or with the addition of 15 mL of milk to 135 mL of tea.2 Another study showed similar findings (no difference in increase intotal phenols, catechins, quercetin and kaempferol). in the AUC of catechins when black tea was taken with the addition of 70 mL milk was reported in another study.4As regards the plasma antioxidant effect of tea, three studies3-5found that the addition of milk to black (fermented )tea did not alter the increase in antioxidant potential, whereas one study found that the addition of milk to black tea (3 measures consumed between 9 am and 12 noon) markedly reduced the increase inantioxidant effect at 12 noon, but it was only slightly reduced at3 pm. 6The addition of milk also had no effect on the antioxidant effect of green tea in one study.5 In another study in 16 healthy women, the addition of milk (to a final concentration of 10%) to black tea completely prevented the increase in endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilation seen withblack tea alone. However, the increase in endothelial-independentvasodilation was not affected by the addition of milk to tea. 7 Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism It has been suggested that substances in milk (such as casein7) might reduce the absorption of catechins and flavonoids from tea, but this has not been demonstrated in many of the studies. Importance and management Although the evidence is not entirely conclusive, there appears to be no important interaction between milk and black (fermented) tea,suggesting that the addition of milk does not reduce the antioxidanteffects of tea. Similar levels of potentially active catechins andflavonoids can be expected, however the tea is taken. This suggeststhat milk is also unlikely to alter the absorption of catechins fromgreen tea supplements. 1. van the effect of milk. Eur J Clin Nutr (1998) 52, 356 -9. Hof KH, Tijburg LB, Katan MB.

Tea + Herbal medicines; Pepper The interaction between green tea and pepper is based onexperimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in mice, piperine modestly increased the bioavailability ofepigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from green tea , with a 30% increase in the AUC 1-5and maximum plasma levels.1 In vitro ,piperine inhibited the intestinal glucuronidation of epigallocatechin-3-gallate by up to 60% when used at a concentra- tion of 500 micromoles/L.1 Mechanism Piperine appeared bioavailability by inhibiting glucuronidation and gastrointestinal transit.1 Importance and management The available evidence is from experimental studies only, but it does provide some evidence that piperine (an alkaloid derived from blackpepper, page 313) can modestly increase bioavailability of the greentea catechin studied. However, the increases seen are probablyunlikely to be clinically important, even if they were to be replicatedin a clinical study. Evidence regarding the interactions of otherherbal medicines with tea is limited, but the caffeine content of tea suggests that it may interact with other herbal medicines in the same way as caffeine, see Caffeine + Herbal medicines; Bitter orange,page 101, and Ephedra + Caffeine, page 176. 1.

Tea + Irinotecan The information regarding the use of green tea with irinotecan isbased on experimental evidence only. Evidence, mechanism, importance and management Based on the results of in vitro studies, it was considered that usual pharmacological doses of green tea catechins were unlikely to inhibit the formation of active metabolites of irinotecan. There was no induction of CYP3A4 metabolism, and just modest and variable induction of glucuronidation (UGT1A1). However, the authors didconclude that these effects require confirmation in patients. 1 1. Mirkov S, Komoroski F. Effects green tea compounds on irinotecan metabolism. Drug Metab Dispos (2007) 35, 228 -33. Tea + Iron compounds Black tea appears to reduce the absorption of iron and maycontribute to iron deficiency anaemia. Green tea appears to havemuch smaller, if any, effects. Clinical evidence (a) Black tea There are few data on the effect of tea on the absorption of iron from supplements. One case report describes an impaired response to iron,given to correct iron deficiency anaemia, in a patient drinking 2 litresof black tea daily. The patient recovered when the black tea wasstopped. This report did not specify whether the black tea was teawithout milk, or black (fermented) tea. 1 Some short-term controlled studies show a marked reduction in the absorption of dietary non-haem iron with black (fermented) tea beverage, some of which are cited for information.2-5In one of these, in a series of studies in healthy subjects, a 275 mL serving of black(fermented, Assam) tea reduced the absorption of radiolabelled ironfrom a 50 g bread roll by 79 to 94%. The tea was prepared by adding300 mL of boiling water to 3 g of Assam tea, then infusing for10 minutes before straining and serving. Milk added to the tea had very little effect on the reduction in iron absorption. 5A study found that 150 mL of black tea reduced the absorption of radiolabelled iron386 Tea Tfrom a test meal by 59% in 10 women with iron deficiency anaemia and by 49% in 10 control subjects without anaemia. When thequantity of tea was increased to 300 mL iron absorption was reduced by about 66% in both groups. 6 Whether these reductions in iron absorption are important in the development of iron deficiency anaemia is less clear. Various epidemiological studies have looked at the correlation between teaconsumption and iron deficiency in different populations. In onereview of 16 of these studies, tea consumption did not influence ironstatus in people with adequate iron stores (as is common in theWest), but there seemed to be a negative association between tea consumption and iron status in people with marginal iron status. 7 Another report describes no change in the absorption of a single dose of iron (2 to 15.8 mg/kg) in 10 iron-deficient children when the ironwas given with 150 mL of tea (type unspecified) instead of water. 8 (b) Green tea A study found that green tea extract (37 mg catechins) showed a modest 26% reduction in iron absorption,9and another study, of pure epigallocatechin gallate 150 mg and 300 mg, found only a 14% and27% reduction in iron absorption, respectively. 10A study in 4 elderly patients with iron deficiency anaemia and 11 control patients foundno evidence that green tea inhibited the absorption of iron fromsodium ferrous citrate. 11Another study in pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia reported a slightly higher resolution rate foranaemia in patients taking green tea. 12 Note that tea has been used with some success in reducing iron accumulation and the frequency of phlebotomy in patients with ironoverload syndromes. 13 Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Tannins found in tea are thought to form insoluble complexes with non-haem iron and thus reduce its absorption.2,3Other polyphenolic compounds found in tea may also reduce the bioavailability of non-haem iron. One study reported that beverages containing 100 to400 g of polyphenols may reduce iron absorption by 60 to 90%. 5 Importance and management The general importance of these findings is uncertain, but be aware that black tea consumption may contribute to iron deficiencyanaemia. However, it has been suggested that no restrictions are required in healthy patients not at risk of iron deficiency. 14 Conversely, the suggestion is that patients at risk of iron deficiency (which would include those requiring iron supplements) should beadvised to avoid tea with meals and for one hour after eating. 14Note that tea is not generally considered to be a suitable drink for babiesand children, because of its effects on iron absorption. Milk does notattenuate the effect of black (fermented) teas on iron absorption. The available data suggest that green tea extracts rich in catechins have less effect on iron absorption than tea beverages from black(fermented) teas. 1. Mahlknecht U, Weidmann E, Seipelt G.

Clinical evidence In a study in 42 healthy subjects, green tea extract four capsules daily for 4 weeks had no effect on the metabolism of a single 25-mg dose of losartan to the metabolite E3174. The green tea catechin extract used in this study, Polyphenon E , contained 80 to 98% total catechins, of which 50 to 75% (200 mg per capsule) wasepigallocatechin gallate. It was essentially decaffeinated (0.5% w/w caffeine). 1 Experimental evidence Because of the quality of the clinical evidence (controlled pharmacokinetic studies), experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism This study suggests that green tea catechins do not affect the metabolism of losartan. Importance and management Evidence is limited to this one study, which suggests that no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected between decaffeinated greentea extract and losartan. Losartan can be used as a probe drug forCYP2C9 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that apharmacokinetic interaction as a result of this mechanism between green tea extracts and other CYP2C9 substrates is unlikely. 1. Chow HH, Hakim IA, Vining DR, Crowell JA, Cordova CA, Chew WM, Xu MJ, Hsu CH, Ranger-Moore J, Alberts DS. Effects of repeated green tea catechin administration on human cytochrome P450 activity. Cancer (2006) 15, 2473 -6. Tea + Warfarin and related drugs Case reports suggest that tea may reduce the INR in response to warfarin. Clinical evidence A patient taking warfarin had a reduction in his INR from a range of 3.2 to 3.79 down to 1.37, which was attributed to the ingestion ofvery large quantities of green tea (about 2 to 4 litres each day for one week). This interaction was attributed to the vitamin K contentof the tea. 1However, although dried tea, including green tea , is very high in vitamin K 1, the brewed liquid made from the tea contains negligible amounts of vitamin K 1,2and is therefore not considered to contribute any vitamin K 1to the diet.2The reason for this interaction is therefore unclear, unless the patient was eating some of the brewedtea leaves. Another man stabilised on warfarin was found to have an INR of 4.43 at a routine clinic visit, which was increased from 3.07 sixweeks previously. The patient had stopped taking a herbal productNature 's Life Greens that month because he did not have enough money to buy it. He had been taking it for the past 7 years as a vitamin supplement because he had previously been instructed to limit his intake of green leafy vegetables. He was eventuallyTea 387 Trestabilised on warfarin and the same nutritional product.3The product label listed 25 vegetables without stating the amounts or concentrations,3but at least 5 of the listed ingredients are known to contain high levels of vitamin K 1including parsley, green tea leaves , spinach, broccoli and cabbage. It is therefore likely that it containedsufficient vitamin to antagonise the effect of the warfarin so thatwhen it was stopped the warfarin requirements fell and, without anappropriate adjustment in dose, this resulted in an increased INR. Experimental evidence Because of the extensive clinical evidence available, experimental data have not been sought. Mechanism Unknown. Green and black (fermented) tea do not alter the pharmacokinetics of some CYP2C9 substrates. See losartan,page 387, and flurbiprofen, page 385. Therefore it is unlikely thata pharmacokinetic interaction occurs with warfarin, which isprincipally metabolised by this isoenzyme. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between tea and warfarin appears to be limited to two case reports. Vitamin K 1antagonises the effect of warfarin and similar anticoagulants, and this is present in high levels in green tea leaves. However, it is a fat-soluble vitamin, and istherefore not present in brewed tea or water extracts of green tea. Ingeneral, a reduction in warfarin effects via this mechanism would beunexpected with tea or tea supplements. Nevertheless, some considerthat increased monitoring of INR is advisable when patients taking warfarin want to stop or start any herbal medicine or nutritional supplement. Because of the many other factors influencing antic-oagulant control, it is not possible to reliably ascribe a change inINR specifically to a drug interaction in a single case report withoutother supporting evidence. It may be better to advise patients todiscuss the use of any herbal products that they wish to try, and toincrease monitoring if this is thought advisable. Cases of uneventfuluse should be reported, as they are as useful as possible cases of adverse effects. However, note that it has been suggested that tea, particularly green tea, may have antiplatelet effects. See Tea + Antiplatelet drugs, page 384. There is a well-established small increased risk ofbleeding when aspirin at antiplatelet doses is combined with theanticoagulant drug warfarin. Theoretically, very high intake of greentea catechins may be sufficient to increase the risk of bleeding with anticoagulant drugs; however, firm evidence for this is lacking. Modest consumption is unlikely to cause any problems. 1. Taylor JR, Wilt VM. Probable antagonism of warfarin by green tea. Ann Pharmacother (1999) 33, 426 -8. 2.

Not to be confused with wild thyme, which is Thymus serpyllum L. Pharmacopoeias Thyme ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Thyme Oil ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4); Thymol (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Wild Thyme (BP 2009 , Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The major non-volatile constituents of thyme are the flavonoids including apigenin, eriodictyol, luteolin, narin- caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, saponins and tannins. The p-cymene, linalool, -terpineol and thujan-4-ol. Other species contain similar constituents, although some varieties contain less thymol and more of the other components.Use and indications Thyme is used traditionally as a carminative, spasmolytic and antimicrobial, particularly for the respiratory system.Thymol is widely used in dentistry as a mouthwash, but it istoxic in high doses and should not be taken internally or applied externally in large amounts. Thyme is commonly used as a flavouring ingredient in foods. Pharmacokinetics An aqueous extract of thyme has been identified isoenzymes, namelyCYP2C9, in an in vitro study. 1However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, as the study also found St John 's wort to be a CYP3A4 inhibitor, whereas clinically it is a CYP3A4inducer. For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in thyme, see under flavonoids, page 186. Interactions overview No interactions with thyme found. Note that thyme iscommonly used as a flavouring ingredient in foods. For information on the interactions of individual flavo- noids present in thyme, see under flavonoids, page 186. 1.

The related species Curcuma aromatica Salisb. is known wild or aromatic turmeric Curcuma xanthorrhiza D. Dietr. is known as ). Constituents The active constituents are curcuminoids , and include a mixture known as curcumin which contains diferuloyl- methane (sometimes referred to as curcumin or curcumin I), (curcumin II), bisdesmethoxycurcu- min (curcumin III) and (curcumin IV). Most commercially available preparations of 'curcumin 'are not pure, but also contain desmethoxycurcumin and bisdes-methoxycurcumin. related species Curcuma aromatica andCurcuma xanthorrhiza also contain curcuminoids. The essential oil contains mainly turmerones, including zingiberene. Use and indications Turmeric has many biological activities, which are mainlyattributed to the curcuminoids that it contains. It is widely used as an anti-inflammatory and liver protecting agent, and its chemopreventive effects for cancer (inhibition of tumourformation, promotion, progression and dissemination inmany animal models) are the subject of much research. Turmeric is also used for disorders related to the ageingprocess. Curcumin has an anti-oxidant and anti-inflamma-tory activity, and has been proposed as a treatment for many degenerative diseases with an inflammatory or oxidativebasis, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, arthrosis and arthritis, among others. Turmeric is also used as a spice in food. Pharmacokinetics An in vitro study suggested that curcumin-containing extracts from Curcuma longa may inhibit intestinal CYP3A4;1this finding is supported by a study in rats, see midazolam, page 392. A study in ratsfed curcumin, found that even large amounts of curcumin (5 did not alter theactivity of hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. 2 Several in vitro studies have suggested that curcumin inhibits or alters the effects of P-glycoprotein.3-5See also beta blockers, page 391. Further study using individualcurcumin constituents extracted from turmeric powder found that curcumin I has a greater inhibitory action on P- glycoprotein than curcumin II or curcurmin III, 6although curcumin III has been shown to have a greater influence onthe multidrug resistance gene (of which P-glycoprotein is a product). 7 Interactions overview Turmeric or its constituent curcumin affects the absorption of some beta blockers, increases the absorption of midazolam,but does not affect the absorption of iron. Piperine, from pepper, enhances the bioavailability of curcumin. 1. Hou XL, Takahashi K, Kinoshita N, Qiu F, Tanaka K, Komatsu K, Takahashi K, Azuma J.

BMC Cancer (2004) 4, 13.T 390Turmeric + Beta blockers In a clinical study, curcumin, a major constituent of turmeric, decreased the absorption of talinolol, a P-glycoprotein substrate. Curcumin increased the absorption of celiprolol, another P-glycoprotein substrate, in rats. Clinical evidence In a randomised study, 12 healthy subjects were given a single 50-mg dose of talinolol after taking curcumin , a major constituent of turmeric, 300 mg daily for 6 days. Curcumin was found to reduce the AUC and maximum plasma level of talinolol by 33% and 28%, respectively, but no clinically significant changes in heart rate orblood pressure occurred. 1 Experimental evidence In a study, rats were given curcumin 60 mg/kg daily for 5 days. Thirty minutes after the last dose of curcumin , a single 30-mg/kg dose of celiprolol was given. Curcumin increased the AUC and maximum plasma concentration of celiprolol by 30% and 90%, respectively. In a parallel single-dose study in rats curcumin 60 mg/kg, given 30 minutes before a single 30-mg/kg dose of celiprolol , had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of celiprolol .2 MechanismIt was thought that curcumin inhibits P-glycoprotein and therefore increases the absorption of P-glycoprotein substrates such astalinolol. This appears to be the case in a ratstudy, where curcumin had effects similar to (but weaker than) other known, clinicallyrelevant P-glycoprotein inhibitors, that is, it increased the absorptionof celiprolol, another P-glycoprotein substrate. However, in aclinical study the absorption of talinolol was unexpectedly decreased by curcumin, although, clinically, the known P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil also decreases talinolol absorption. This suggests that there may be other mechanisms involved in talinolol absorption.Differential effects on hepatic and intestinal P-glycoprotein may alsobe of relevance. Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between curcumin (a major constituent of turmeric) and beta blockers is sparse, but the available evidence does suggest that curcumin can modify the absorption of beta blockers that are P-glycoprotein substrates. The findings withtalinolol were similar to the effects seen clinically with otherP-glycoprotein inhibitors (see Mechanism above). However, theeffects on absorption were modest, and beta blockers are generallyaccepted to have a wide therapeutic margin, so these findings wouldnot be expected to be clinically relevant. It is unclear whether the effects of curcumin on celiprolol in rats will be replicated in humans. However, as with talinolol the effects were modest and are therefore unlikely to be clinically relevant. 1.

Turmeric is used as a spice in food.Turmeric + Herbal medicines; Pepper Piperine, a major constituent of pepper, increases the bioavail-ability of curcumin, a major constituent of turmeric. Clinical evidence In a crossover study, 8 healthy subjects were given a single 2-g dose of curcumin , a major constituent of turmeric, powder alone, or with piperine , a major constituent of pepper, powder 20 mg. When curcumin was given alone, its serum levels were either very low or undetectable. The addition of piperine increased curcumin levels 30-fold over the first 45 minutes, and the relative bioavailability of curcumin was increased 20-fold. Concurrent use was well tolerated.1 Experimental evidence In an experimental study, ratswere given a single 2-g/kg dose of curcumin alone, or with piperine 20 mg/kg. Although piperine modestly increased the maximum levels and AUC of curcumin, these changes were not statistically significant. Note that curcuminwas reasonably well absorbed in rats, in contrast to humans, where absorption is poor, but this may have been due to the much greaterdoses given. 1 Mechanism Unknown. It was suggested that piperine may inhibit the metabolism of curcumin. Importance and management In general the evidence supports the suggestion that piperine (a constituent of pepper) increases the bioavailability of curcumin (amajor constituent of turmeric). This interaction may be beneficialbecause the effects of curcumin may be increased; however, it mayalso increase the potential for curcumin to interact with other medicines. The effect of piperine on the absorption of curcumin from turmeric extracts does not appear to have been studied, but itseems reasonable to expect a similar increase in bioavailability. 1. Shoba G, Joy D, Joseph T, Majeed M, Rajendran R, Srinivas PSSR. Influence of piperine on the pharmacokinetics of curcumin in animals and human volunteers. Planta Med (1998) 64, 353 -6. Turmeric + Iron compounds Turmeric does not appear to affect the bioavailability of dietarylevels of iron. Clinical evidence In a randomised, crossover study, 30 healthy women were given a standard Thai meal (fortified with about 4 mg of isotopically labelledferrous sulfate), with rice, to which 500 mg of ground turmeric hadbeen added. Turmeric was found to have no effect on the absorption of iron. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism It was thought that polyphenols in turmeric may inhibit iron absorption. Importance and management The study cited suggests that turmeric does not inhibit the absorption of dietary levels of iron. However, the authors note that the amountof turmeric used was relatively low, when compared with the intakefrom some Asian diets. Furthermore, the effects of turmeric on ironsupplementation (e.g. ferrous sulfate in doses of 200 mg) does not appear to have been studied, so it is difficult to predict the effect of the use of turmeric as a herbal medicine on iron replacement therapy.Turmeric 391 THowever, what is known suggests that an interaction would not be expected. 1. Tuntipopipat S, Judprasong K, Zeder C, Wasantwisut R, Walczyk T. Chili, but not turmeric, inhibits iron absorption in young women from an iron-fortified composite meal. J Nutr (2006) 136, 2970 -4. Turmeric + Midazolam The interaction between curcumin, a major constituent of turmeric, and midazolam is based on experimental evidence only. Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study, rats were given curcumin , a major constituent of turmeric, 60 mg/kg daily for 5 days. Thirty minutes after the last dose ofcurcumin , a single 20-mg/kg dose of midazolam was given. Curcumin increased the AUC of midazolam 3.8-fold and, although the maximum plasma level was approximately doubled, this was not statistically significant.1 Mechanism Midazolam is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP3A(specifically the isoenzyme CYP3A4). The authors of the study suggest that curcumin inhibited intestinal CYP3A, resulting in adecrease in the metabolism of midazolam by this route, which led to an increase in its bioavailability. Importance and management Evidence appears to be limited to this study in rats, which demonstrated a large increase in the bioavailability of midazolam. These findings are difficult to reliably extrapolate to humans, but, asthe effect was so large, it would seem reasonable to assume thatcurcumin could cause a clinically relevant increase in thebioavailability of midazolam, which may lead to an increase in thesedative effects of midazolam. It is not clear whether turmeric, ofwhich curcumin is a major constituent, would have similar effects,but if large doses are given an effect seems possible. It would seem prudent to warn patients taking curcumin, and turmeric, about the possible increase in sedative effects. Midazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between curcumin (and therefore possibly turmeric) and otherCYP3A4 substrates is possible. See the table Drugs and herbsaffecting or metabolised by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymeCYP3A4, page 8, for a list of known CYP3A4 substrates. 1. Zhang W, Tan TMC, Lim L-Y.

(Valerianaceae) Synonym(s) valerian, Fragrant valerian, Garden valerian. Many other Valerian species are used in different parts of the world. Pharmacopoeias Powdered Valerian ( Extract ( Ph Eur 6.4 ); Valerian Dry Hydroalcoholic Extract (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Valerian Root ( Ph Eur 6.4 ); Valerian Tablets ( USP 32 ); Valerian Tincture ( BP ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents Valerian root and rhizome contains a large number ofconstituents which vary considerably according to the sourceof the plant material and the method of processing and storage. Many are known to contribute to the activity, and even those that are known to be unstable may produce activedecomposition products. The valepotriates include the valtrates, which are active constituents, but decompose on storage to form other actives including baldrinal, and volatileconstituents. The volatile oil is composed of valerenic acidsand their esters, and other derivatives including isovaleric acid (which is responsible for the odour of valerian), and others. Other constituents present include: sterols including -sitosterol. Valerian dry hydroalcoholic extract is an extract produced from valerian root and contains a minimum of 0.25% sesquiterpenic acids, expressed as valerenic acid. Use and indications Valerian is used particularly for stress and insomnia. It has long been used as a hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic,antispasmodic, carminative and antihypertensive, and dysmenorrhoea. showing sedative and anxiolytic effects, and bindingor modulation of constituents to GABA and other neuro- transmitter receptors, the clinical efficacy is not conclusively proven. A recent study suggested that it is safe, but notnecessarily effective; however, many analytical reports also show that extracts and products of valerian vary greatly in both chemical composition and biological activity, and itmay be that only certain preparations have any therapeuticbenefit. Many commercial products use valerian in combin-ation with hops, passiflora and other herbal extracts, andthere is some evidence that these may be more efficacious, although again this is not clinically proven. The use of valerian as an aid to benzodiazepine withdrawal has beensuggested on the basis of GABA-receptor binding effects, and there is a small study in mice which suggests that it may be useful to a limited extent; again this has not been shown clinically. Pharmacokinetics Anin vitro study using a number of different valerian root preparations (capsules or tablets of the powdered extract, and teas) found that the products tested inhibited the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4.1Other in vitro studies have found no effects,2or an inductive effect at levels unlikely to be obtained clinically.3Generally, studies suggest that any effect on CYP3A4 is unlikely to be of clinical importance, seebenzodiazepines, page 396. A further in vitro study 2suggests that valerian has no effect, or weak effects, on CYP1A2 (see also caffeine,page 397), CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. This study also suggeststhat valerian does not affect CYP2D6, although another in vitro study suggests that valerian may cause induction of CYP2D6, but this was at concentrations that are unlikely tobe attained in vivo. 3These effects are unlikely to be clinically relevant because a study in 12 healthy subjects found that valerian root extract had no significant effects on the metabolism of debrisoquine, a probe substrate for CYP2D6,4 as did another clinical study using dextromethorphan,page 397). A further clinical study suggests that valerian also has no clinically relevant effect on CYP2E1, see chlorzoxazone, page 397. In vitro investigations have suggested that valerian may inhibit P-glycoprotein, 1,5although the authors of one study concluded that this is unlikely to be clinically relevant,because the concentration at which this occurred is unlikelyto be attained in vivo, 5and the findings of another study suggested that the effects were much weaker than those ofverapamil, a known, clinically relevant P-glycoproteininhibitor. 1 For information on the pharmacokinetics of individual flavonoids present in valerian, see under flavonoids,page 186. Interactions overview Valerian does not appear to affect the metabolism ofalprazolam, caffeine, chlorzoxazone, dextromethorphan or midazolam to a clinically relevant extent. Valerian may increase the sleeping time in mice in response to alcohol and barbiturates.

Clinical evidence No interactions found. Experimental evidence In a study in mice, a valepotriate extract of valerian, given in high doses, almost doubled the sleeping time in response to alcohol. In contrast, in a separate experiment, the extract appeared to antagonisethe effects of alcohol on motor activity. 1 Mechanism Additive CNS depressant effects. Importance and management The evidence of an interaction between valerian and alcohol appears to be limited to a study in mice. However, valerian is said to have sedative effects, and is used for insomnia, and so additive effects onsedation seem possible. The manufacturers 2,3of two herbal products containing valerian that are registered by the MHRA in the UKadvise against excessive alcohol intake while taking valerianbecause the sedative effect of valerian may be potentiated by alcohol. It seems reasonable to suggest that additive sedative effects are possible. It would be prudent to warn patients that they may bemore sedated if they drink alcohol while taking valerian and, if thisoccurs, to avoid undertaking skilled tasks. Note that, in the study inmice, the sedative effects of valepotriates, even in large doses, were more modest than those of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide.Remember that not all the indications of valerian are as ananxiolytic/hypnotic. 1.

Experimental evidence In a study in mice,valerenic acid (an active constituent of valerian) 50 or 100 mg/kg was found to increase sedation (measured by balance tests), but only at the highest doses. The effect was strongest 10 to 15 minutes after administration. Pentobarbital 60 mg/kg also sedated the mice, but the effects were more pronounced than those with valerenic acid . When both substances were given together, valerenic acid prolonged the sleeping time in response to pento- barbital . The effect was dose dependent, with the higher valerenic acid dose approximately doubling the pentobarbital sleeping time.1 Mechanism Valerenic acid has non-specific central nervous depressant proper- ties, which appear to enhance the effects of pentobarbital.1 Importance and management Evidence for an interaction between valerenic acid and pentobarbital appears to be limited to this study in mice; however, the effects are in line with the known activities of both substances. It is unclearwhether the use of valerian would result in an effect of similarmagnitude, but some additive sedation seems likely. Other barbit-urates do not appear to have been studied, but it seems likely thatthey will interact similarly. It may therefore be prudent to consider the potential additive sedative effects in any patient taking barbiturates with valerian. This seems most likely to be ofimportance with the use of phenobarbital (or other barbiturates) for epilepsy, when sedative effects are less desirable. It would beprudent to warn patients that they may be more sedated and, if thisoccurs, to avoid undertaking skilled tasks. Remember that not all theindications of valerian are as an anxiolytic/hypnotic. 1. Hendriks H, Bos R, Woerdenbag HJ, Koster AS. Central nervous depressant activity of valerenic acid in the mouse. Planta Med (1985) 51, 28 -31. Valerian + Benzodiazepines Valerian does not affect the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam ormidazolam to a clinically relevant extent. However, additivesedative effects are a possibility. Clinical evidence In a crossover study, 12 healthy subjects were given valerian root extract 1 g each night for 14 days, with a single 2-mg dose of alprazolam on the morning of day 15. Valerian increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 20%, but there were no other statistically significant changes in the pharmaco-kinetics of alprazolam .1The valerian extract used in this study contained 11 mg of valerenic acid per gram. In another study, 12 healthy subjects were given valerian root extract 125 mg three times daily for 28 days before receiving a singledose of midazolam . Valerian root extract caused no significant changes in the metabolism of midazolam .2 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Valerian has been found in some in vitro studies to be an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme by this isoenzyme. The minor pharmacokinetic changes reported thereforesuggest that, clinically, valerian has only slight effects on CYP3A4. Importance and management Evidence from two well-designed clinical studies suggest that valerian does not have a clinically relevant effect on thepharmacokinetics of either alprazolam or midazolam (the 20% rise in alprazolam levels seen in one study would not be expected to be clinically relevant). Therefore no dosage adjustment of eitherbenzodiazepine would appear to be needed if valerian is alsogiven. However, note that valerian is said to have sedative effects,and is used for insomnia, and so additive effects on sedation seempossible. There seems to be no reason to avoid the concurrent use ofvalerian with alprazolam or midazolam, but, as with any combin-ation of CNS depressant drugs, warn patients that they be more drowsy, and caution against undertaking skilled tasks if this occurs. Midazolam is used as a probe drug for CYP3A4 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter- action between valerian and other CYP3A4 ) had minimal effects on CYP3A4 activity and no effect on CYP2D6 activity in healthy volunteers.

In vivo effects of goldenseal, kava Caffeine Valerian does not affect the pharmacokinetics of caffeine to a clinically relevant extent. However, the stimulant effects ofcaffeine may oppose the hypnotic effects of valerian. Clinical evidence In a study, 12 non-smoking healthy subjects were given valerian root extract 125 mg three times daily for 28 days with a single 100-mgdose of oral caffeine at the end of supplementation. Valerian root extract caused no significant changes in the metabolism of caffeine. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Opposing pharmacological effects. Importance and management Although the evidence is limited to one study, it was a well-designed study in healthy subjects. It suggests that the use of valerian will notalter the pharmacokinetics of caffeine. However, the effects ofcaffeine (a stimulant) are likely to be in direct opposition to theeffects of valerian (a hypnotic) and, although this does not appear tohave been studied, caffeine has been shown to diminish the effects of other known hypnotic drugs. Therefore patients requiring valerian for its hypnotic properties should probably also consider theircaffeine intake. Caffeine is used as a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between valerian and other CYP1A2 substrates is unlikely. 1. Gurley BJ, Gardner SF, Hubbard MA, Williams DK, Gentry WB, Khan IA, Shah A. In vivo effects of goldenseal, kava does not affect the pharmacokinetics of chlorzoxazone to a clinically relevant extent. However, additive sedative effectsare a possibility. Clinical evidence In a study, 12 healthy subjects were given valerian root extract 125 mg three times daily for 28 days with a single 250-mg dose oforal chlorzoxazone at the end of supplementation. Valerian rootextract caused no significant changes in the metabolism ofchlorzoxazone. 1 Experimental evidence No relevant data found. Mechanism Additive pharmacological effects. Importance and management Although the evidence is limited to one study, it was a well-designed study in healthy subjects. It suggests that the use of valerian will not alter the pharmacokinetics of chlorzoxazone. However, note thatchlorzoxazone has sedative effects and, although this was notstudied, it may be prudent to consider the possibility of additivesedation when valerian is also given.Chlorzoxazone is used as a probe drug for CYP2E1 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokinetic inter-action between valerian and other CYP2E1 substrates is unlikely. 1. Gurley BJ, Gardner SF, Hubbard MA, Williams DK, Gentry WB, Khan IA, Shah A. In vivo effects of goldenseal, kava not affect the pharmacokinetics of dextromethor- phan to a clinically relevant extent. Clinical evidence In a crossover study, 12 healthy subjects were given valerian root extract 1 g each night for 14 days, with a single 30-mg dose ofdextromethorphan on the morning of day 15. Valerian extract causedno significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of dextromethor-phan. The valerian extract used in this study contained 11 mg ofvalerenic acid per gram. 1 Experimental evidence See Pharmacokinetics, page 394, for in vitro studies of the possible inducing effects of valerian on the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6. Mechanism Although in vitro study valerian may induce the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6, this effect only occurred at high dose, and the clinical study suggests that this effect does notoccur in humans. Importance and management Although the evidence is limited to one study, it was a well-designed study in healthy subjects. It suggests that the use of valerian will notalter the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan is used as a probe drug for CYP2D6 activity, and therefore these results also suggest that a pharmacokineticinteraction between valerian and ) had minimal effects on CYP3A4 activity and no effect on CYP2D6 activity in healthy volunteers.

Constituents The major constituents of the root and rhizome are saponins based mainly on diosgenin and other sapogenins; they include dioscin and dioscorin. Use and indications Traditionally, wild yam was used to treat rheumatism andintestinal colic. However, more recently wild yam extract hasfound favour as a form of topical hormone replacementtherapy for women. It is often claimed that wild yam is asource of 'natural progesterone ', but this is not the case -it is a source of diosgenin, which is used by the pharmaceuticalindustry as a chemical precursor for the production ofprogesterone. Pharmacokinetics No relevant pharmacokinetic data found. Interactions overview No interactions with wild yam found. W 398Willow Salix species (Salicaceae) Synonym(s) and related species ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ); Willow Bark Dry Extract ( BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents The bark of willow contains the alcohol, and flavonoids and tannins are also present. Extracts are sometimes standardised to a minimum of 1.5% of total salicylic derivatives, expressed as salicin (BP 2009, Ph Eur 6.4). Use and indications The bark of willow is reported to have analgesic,anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and astringent properties. It has long been used for treating all kinds of fevers, headache,influenza, rheumatism, gout and arthritis. Pharmacokinetics In a pharmacokinetic study, 10 healthy subjects were giventwo oral doses of Salix purpurea bark extract, each standardised to contain 120 mg of salicin, 3 hours apartand 30 minutes before meals. Salicylic acid was the most prominent metabolite detected in the serum, with peak levels achieved approximately 1 hour after the dose. TheAUC of salicylic acid from the willow bark extract was equivalent to the AUC of salicylic acid from an 87-mg dose of aspirin (given to healthy subjects in anotherstudy). 1However, it is not clear if this amount of salicylic acid has the same antiplatelet effects as aspirin: one study found that taking an extract of the bark of Salix purpurea andSalix daphnoides , to achieve a salicin dose of 240 mgdaily, had a much smaller effect on platelet aggregation than aspirin.2 Interactions overview No interactions with willow found. It has been suggested that willow bark is likely to interact with antiplatelet drugs and NSAIDs (which have antiplatelet effects), and increasethe risk of bleeding with anticoagulants. This is because oneconstituent, salicin , is metabolised to salicylic acid, a substance that is also derived from aspirin. Given thatpharmacokinetic studies (see above) suggest that doses ofwillow bark extracts can achieve levels of salicylic acid thatare equivalent to an 87-mg dose of aspirin, this seems reasonable. However, other studies suggest that the antiplatelet effects of aspirin are much greater than thoseof willow bark, which suggests that willow bark extractsmay be less likely to interact than aspirin. The antiplatelet effects of willow bark need much more research before any firm recommendations can be made about its potential tointeract with antiplatelet drugs, NSAIDs and anticoagulants; however, until more is known some caution is warranted. The concurrent use of willow bark and antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin or clopidogrel) need not be avoided: indeed combinations of antiplatelet drugs are often prescribed together, but it may be prudent to be aware of the potential for increased bleeding. Patients should discuss any episodeof prolonged bleeding with a healthcare professional. Clinically, the use of an antiplatelet drug with an anticoagulant should generally be avoided in the absenceof a specific indication. It may therefore be prudent to adviseagainst concurrent use with willow bark. However, if concurrent use is felt desirable it would seem sensible to warn patients to be alert for any signs of bruising orbleeding, and report these immediately should they occur. This advice is probably applicable to any herb with known antiplatelet effects. 1. Schmid B, K\u00f6tter I, Heide L.

Pharmacopoeias Yarrow (BP 2009 ,Ph Eur 6.4 ). Constituents Yarrow contains a volatile oil composed of various monoterpenes (including closely related Achillea collina andAchillea lanulosa but it is reported to . and sugars. Use and indications Yarrow has been used in the treatment of bruises, swellingsand strains, and for fevers and colds. It has also been used for essential hypertension, amenorrhoea, dysentery, diarrhoeaand specifically for thrombotic conditions. There is little, ifany, clinical evidence to support these uses, but extracts and many of the constituents have reported anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet activity. Pharmacokinetics Anin vitro study suggests that ethanol extracts of yarrow leaves and flowers markedly inhibit the cytochrome P450isoenzyme CYP2C19 but have only weak inhibitory effectson CYP3A4. The clinical significance of the effects onCYP2C19 is unknown. 1For information on the pharmaco- kinetics of individual flavonoids present in yarrow, see underflavonoids, page 186.
