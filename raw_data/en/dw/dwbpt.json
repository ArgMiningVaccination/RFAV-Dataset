Chief Consultant, SKV Ayurveda Clinic, Kollam Kerala Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia M5b is a type of pediatric AML accounting for 1 -3% of primary childhood AML. Here we aim to do a comparative study of precisio n Ayurvedic therapy in pediatric AML -M5b and adult Myelo dysplastic syndrome. The subject is a 8 week old baby showing Nausea, paleness and reddish firm rashes on skin. Diagnosis was made on the basis of peripheral blood smear, immunophenotyping with flow cytometry and clinical symptoms. Chemotherapy and stem cell transplant were excluded because of the age and physical condition of the baby. The child was managed with Ayurvedic regime within 7 days of diagnosis. The second subject is a 48 years old male fr om Gwahati Assam. Showing symptoms of paleness, fatigue breathlessness during exertion and erection problems. Diagnosis was made as MDS on the basis of peripheral smear, Bone narrow biopsy and chromosomal studies. The patient was not responding to any conventional standard Allopathic therapies with progressive worsening of refractive Cytopenia. The subject was started with Ayurvedic therapy one year after diagnosis. In this research article we aim to discuss pediatric AML M5b and adult MDS managed to compl ete remission by Ayurvedic regime. Both patients have completed over 5 years of complete remission from their respective conditions. Here we elaborate the treatment modalities used to manage these deadly conditions and highlight the necessary scientific li terature. Key Words: Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelo dysplastic Blast cells INTRODUCTION Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common Leukemia in adults. It accounts for 3 -5 cases per 100000 people pe r year. AML in contrast accounts for less than 10% cases of acute Leukemia in children less than 10 years of age. A significant increase in AML incidence has occurred over the past 10 years. AML comprises a type of hematologic malignancies with clonal prol iferation of myeloid precursors with reduced capacity to differentiate into more mature cellular elements. As a results of mutations in precursor cells immature Leukemia cells called blasts are produced in the bone marrow which enter into peripheral blood and occasionally other body tissues. When the percentage of blasts in the bone narrow and peripheral blood is above 20 -30% the condition is considered as Acute Leukemia. A major difference between the WHO and French American British (FAB) classification is the blast cutoff for a diagnosis of AML as opposed to Myelo dysplastic syndromes (MDS), it is 20% in the WHO classification and 30% in the FAB system. Because of the Leukemic blasts cells normal hematopoiesis is hindered resulting with a variable reductio n in the production of normal white blood cells, Red blood cells and platelets. This results in reduced immunity, Anemia and hemorrhagic tendencies. This reduction of the blood elements is named Cytopenia. In AML and MDS Cytopenia cannot be improved by treatment, the cytopenia not responding to any medication is termed as Refractive cytopenia. However, in Acute Leukemia a large increase in WBC count is common, this Leukocytosis is caused by the circulation of immature Myeloid blasts in peripheral blood, the y are dysfunctional mutated cells in circulation. The un -differentiated Myeloid cells show chromosomal abnormalities in about 55% of AML. Translocations are used for disease classification. The French American British classification sub types AML based on morphology and cytochemical staining M1, M3) are granulocytic with different stages of maturation. M4 is 69granulocytic and monocytic where as M5 is M6 Erythro Leukemia and M7 is Megakaryocyte Leukemia. In AML-M5 the patient must have greater than 20% blasts in bone narrow, and of these, greater than 80% must be of the monocytic lineage. A further sub classification M5a and M5b is made depending on whether the monocytes cells are predominantly monoblastic (80%) (acute monoblastic Leukemia) or a mixture of mono blasts and promonocytes (<80% blasts) (acute peomonocytic Leukemia). The immune Phenotyping by flow cytometry revealed the 8-week old and the NK marker CD56. positive for CD34, Fever, anorexia, weightloss, Hepato Splenomeg aly are common with AML. Bleeding associated with coagulopathy may occure in M5. Infiltration of the gingivae, skin, soft tissues or the meninges with Leukemia blasts at diagnosis is characteristic of the Monocytic subjects and those with 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities gum hypertrophy and skin infiltration or nodular (leukemia cuti) is common in M5 subjects. High WBC count, blasts count in circulation, Refractive anemia and refractive thrombocytopenia along with poor patient health conditions in monocytic subtypes are associated with a lower complete remission rate and shorter survival time. Myelo dysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematological disorders broadly characterized by cytopenia associated with a dysmorphic (abnormal appeari ng) and usually cellular bone narrow. This consequently results in ineffective blood cell production. MDS is a relatively common form of bone narrow failure with reported incidence rates of 35100 per million persons in general population and 120 -500 per mi llion elderlies. MDS is rare in children but monocytic Leukemia can be seen. In both AML and MDS mutation in the hematopoitic precursor cells results in ineffective production of blood components. In AML percentage of Leukemia blasts cells has to be above 20-30%. Whears in MDS percentage of blasts is very low. Both canditional usually become severe because of refractive MDS in world health organization classification of MDS. It is characterized by cytopenias, less than 5% blasts and dysplasia. It constitutes 24% cases of MDS and about 11% of RCMD progress to AML. Because of this MDS is often considered a preLeukemic condition. The bone narrow is usually normal or hyper cellular, but in 20% of cases it is sufficiently hypo cellular to be confused with aplasia. Dyserythropoitic changes and ringed sideroblasts in erythroid lineage are seen, Megaloblastic nuclei associated with defective hemoglobinization in the erythroid teenage a re common. Most patients die as a result of complications of pancytopenia and not due to Leukemic transformation. Precipitous worsening of pancytopenia, acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities and increase in the number of blasts are all poor prognost ic factors. The outlook in therapy related MDS is very poor and most patients progress within a few months to refractory AML. Anemia, Thrombocytopenia (Reduced platelets) Leucopenia (reduced WBC) are seen in bone narrow neoplasms like AML, chronic Myeloid Leukemia, MDS etc. WBC count may be raised in Leukemia due to influx of blast cells in blood. Severe paleness of skin, weakness, reduced blood production, fever and deterioration of immune system are consistent with the deadly disease 'Pandu' described in Ayurveda. The term 'Pandu' means white color or pale nature. Any hemato physiological condition resulting in severe paleness of body is defined as 'Pandu' by Susrutha. Susrutha points out that body becomes affected by Pandu because of severe blood loss on due to the complications of Arbuda (arbuda peeda). All pandu conditions are considered caused of all 3 doshas vata, Pitha and Kapha. But due to relative dominance it is considered a Pithika disease. According to symptoms and causative factors it is classified into 5. 70 Due to excess intake of acidic foods, alcohol, salts, other inflammatory habits and foods overtime causes changes in the body owing to recurrent inflammations. This causes vitiation of doshas in the body especially pitha dosha. D ue to reduced metabolic fire and blocked channels in the body, the aggravated pitha is initiated and carried by vata to different parts of the body resulting in paleness, yellowness in skin, eyes etc. This condition in which paleness is seen predominantly is called pandu. Pita is synonymous to fire and has yellowish red properties. But in pandu due to increased vitiation of other doshas. The fire element in pitha becomes relatively reduced due to increase in water and space elements. As a result of this pit ha vikrithi (change) it obtains paleness and this affects all the 5 types of pitha in the body. Chakrapani considers this change in pitha the cause of paleness. Pandu caused by vitiation of all the 3 doshas are considered deadly as they cause destruction o f dhathus (body elements) reduces ojas (immunity), reduces blood production resulting in sequential complications like hemorrhage, fever, dyspnea, cough and eventually death Case presentation The subject is a 8 week old baby boy with no previous familial h istory of any malignant involvement. He started developing low grade fever with firm rashes on the skin, minimal scalp hair, restlessness, not taking food properly and fatigued. On routine blood check up his WBC count was seen very high 1.6 lakhs (5000 -10000 normal) with peripheral blast cells. The subject was taken to Regional Cancer Center in Trivandrum. Diagnosis was made based on physical symptoms, peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry for Immuno phenotyping tumor markers. Peripheral smear and blood count revealed Haemoglobin 8.7% (12 -16 normal), WBC - 268500 (5000 -10000 normal) Blasts - 86%, - 400000) Neutrophils - 1% (65-75% normal) . As it is clear from the blood picture patient was entering blast crisis. As a result, WBC count increased from 160000 to 268500 in a span of 3 days and blast cells were rising rapidly. The blasts cells mainly promonocytes with abundant cytoplasm, indented nuclice and immature chromatin, indented of blasts were w eakly peroxidase positive. Flow cytometry revealed cells markers CD13, CD14, CD33, CD64, CD11c. The blasts co express CD56 (dim), other markers CD34 and HLA DR were positive. This confirmed the diagnosis as Acute Myeloid Leukemia FAB type AMLM5B (promonocytic Leukemia). The biochemical parameters such as uric acid, bilirubin, creatinine, lever enzymes were normal. Serum LDH was raised to 8240 (313 -618 normal). The health and hematological condition of the subject was severely compr omised. Chemotherapy or SCT (Stem cell transplant) could not be done because of the age and health conditions. Subject was discharged after diagnosis from Regional Cancer Center. The body developed reddish hard mass all over body called Leukemia cuti and s wollen gums due to Leukemic infiltrates characteristic of monocytic Leukemia. Ayurvedic treatment was initiated 6 days after diagnosis. The therapy was started with the following regime of medicines. Drug Dose 1. Drakshadi Kashaya 8 ml twice daily 50 mg (Thrice Daily with honey) 71Results The following changes in blood picture and physical symptoms were observed and recorded Blood parameters Before Starting Medication 15 days after Medication 40 days after Medication At 2 years of remission Haemoglobin % 8.4% 8.7 % Netrophils 32% After 15 days of starting Ayurvedic medication blast cell percentage in peripheral circulation showed drastic reduction from 86% to 10% All the blood parameters WBC, Hemoglobin and platelet count showed progressive improvement. This shows progressive improvement in refractive cytopenia, improved hematopoiesis and the rise in Neutrophil level from 1% to 20% suggested improvement in immunity. The physical symptoms like rashes of Leukemia cuti completely van ished after 30days, the child was feeding properly and his overall health improved drastically. The child entered complete remission from diasease at 40 days of therapy. All medicines were continued for 5 years except for bhasma preparations which were sto pped at 3 years. Now the child Is 7 years old free from any signs of relapse, healthy and energetic. Case II The subject is a 48-year-old man from Guahati Assam with no familial history of any hematological or malignant involvement. The subject has a hist ory of malaria attack twice in four years, he was treated with chloroquinine on both instances. One year after second malarial attack he developed paleness edema severe fatigue, breathlessness with exertion and crection problems, mild Hepato splen o Megally. Following blood examination revealed extremely low counts of Hemoglobin - 6% (normal 13-18%), platelets - 10,000 (normal 1.5 - 5 lakhs) and WBC count - 1000 -2000 (normal 5000 -10000). Due to persisting cytopenias bone marrow biopsy was done in G wahati Medical College, later he was referred to Tata Medical College and Christian Medical College Vellore. Bone marrows biopsy was done in all these 3 institutions revealed scanty moderately hypo cellular marrow with absent megakaryocytes. Predominantly erythroid precursors are seen which are megaloblastic in maturation with 1% blasts. These features were suggestive of Myelo dysplastic syndrome. Refractory cytopenia with multi lineage hypo cellularity was seen with less than 5% blasts. The biochemical par ameters such as uric acid, bilirubin, creatinine liver enzymes were normal. Due to seuere Refractive cytopenia subject was given regular blood transfusions from the time of diagnosis. Initially one -two transfusions were done but in 6 -8 months the number of transfusions was increased to 8 -10 per month. The subject was not responsive to any Allopathic medications and refractive cytopenia worsened over the course of one year. Stem cell transplant was advised by Christian medical college Vellore but was given o nly 10% chance of success owing to his health, financial and hematological condition it was ruled out. One year after diagnosis the subject was having 10 transfusions per month. He was started with precise Ayurvedic medication one year after diagnosis. 72Medication Medication Dosage 1. Kalyanakam Kashayam 15 ml twice daily, before food Hareethaki 8. Chandraprabha Vati 1 tab BID with Kashaya Results The following changes in blood prameters and physical conditions were noted after medications. Blood parameters Before Starting Medication 30 days after starting Medication 3 months after starting Medication 2 years after starting medication Haemoglobin % 6.5% 8.9 % 12.4% 14.7% WBC Count 1000 3000 4000 140000 Blast cells 1% of blood transfusion per month 8-10 per month Nil Nil Nil After one month of medication all blood parameters showed improvement cytopenias were improved drastically. The subject was managed by 8 -10 blood transfusions per month before starting medicines. Since starting medications blood transfusion was never again needed. All the blood parameters were progressively improving. His paleness reduced, fatigue edema and crection problems were better after 30 days. Anxiety issues were better after improvement in hematological parameters cytopenia was completely resolved in 2 years. With 2 years of medication all his counts and physical conditions were normal. The medicines were continued for 3 years continuously and stopped thereafter. At 5 years the subject is fully stable even after 2 years of medication free period. 73Discussion A neoplasm is a type of abnormal and excessive growth called neoplasia of tissue. This abnormal growth usually forms a mass. Some neoplasms do not form a tumor (swelling or mass) these includes leukemia and carcinoma in situ. Tumor is also not synonymous with cancer. While cancer by definition is malignant, a tumor can be benign or malignant. Bone marrow neoplasm is the unusual growth of marrow tissue. This overgrowth are associated with a genetic disorder, immunogenic, mutation and radiation ex posure. In Myeloid leukemia abnormal cancerous white cells (WBC) are produced in excess in bone marrow. In Myelo dysplastic Syndrome prior to abnormal growth of tissue as neoplasia cells often undergo abnormal pattern of growth called dysplasia in the bone marrow. Both these conditions, inhibits the production of other essential components RBC, WBC and Platelets. They develop severe anaemia, infections and bleeding. Anaemia is a decrease in the total amount of Red blood cells or a lowered ability of the bl ood to carry oxygen. Anaemia is caused by 3 main reasons. Anaemia along with Thrombocytopaenia (reduced platelets), Leucopenia (Reduced WBC) are seen in Neoplasms of bone marrow, WBC count may be raised in Leukemia due to influx of cancerous blast cells in blood. Severe paleness of skin, weakness, reduced blood production and deterioration of immune system are consistent with the deadly disease 'pandu' described in Ayurveda The Enigma of Pandu - The term pandu means white colour or pale nature. Any hemato p hysiological condition resulting in severe paleness of body is defined as 'pandu' by Susrutha. While describing Raktaja Arbuda (which is essentially a bleeding tumor) Susrutha points out that body becomes afflicted by Pandu because of severe blood loss and due to the complications of Arbuda (arbuda peeda). All Pandu conditions are considered caused of all 3 doshas vata Pitha & kapha. But due to relative dominance it is considered a pithika disease. According to symptoms and causative factors it is classified into 5. 74 Pandu Samprapti - Samprapthi is a Sanskrit technical term translating to 'pathogenesis'. It is the complete attainment or acquisition of pathological route of a disease. The cracking of disease samprapthi of an individual patient is the primary goal for starting Individualized precision therapy. Due to excess intake of acidic foods, Alcohol, Salts, other inflammatory habits and foods overtime causes changes in the body owing to recurrent imflammations. This process causes vitiation of doshas in the body especially pitha dosha. Due to reduced metabolic fire a nd blocked channels in the body. The aggravated pitha is initiated and carried by vata to different parts of the body resulting in paleness, yellowness in skin eyes etc. This condition in which paleness is seen predominantely is called 'pandu'. Pitha is synonymous to fire and has yellowish \u2014 red properties. But in pandu due to increased vitiation of other doshas. The fire element in pitha becomes relatively reduced due to increase in water and space elements. As a result of this pitha vikrithi (change) it obtains paleness and this affects all the 5 types of Pitha in the body. Chakrapani considers this change in pitha the cause of paleness. The changes in the basic elements of Panch abhoota air, Water, Fire, earth and Space affects the composition and nature of body and universe. Complications Succeeding Pandu - When Pandu roga (disease) become severe it results in deterioration of health immune system and deficient blood production s ucceeding this condition it can move forward producing various complications. These dangerous complications can lead to death of a patient. Preceeding death Rishta (sign of death) become visible in last stage of Pathogenises (samprapthi). The different complication pathways are listed below doshas. Pitha Upadrava Samprapthi (Complications) . Succeeding Pandu all these complications can lead to rishta (Signs of death) the pathway taken varies from one person to other according to the preceeding environmental and genetic factors. These complication pathways can be seen together adding to the difficulty in treatment in Leukemia and MDS initially the disease starts with Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, resulting in paleness, extreme weakness etc. and when disease manifest further gets into complications like Raktha Pitha (haemorhagic conditions) in which Pandu being a Pitha disease undergoes further Pitha vitiation leading to increased pitha in blood which in turn makes it less viscous, thus re ducing the clotting capacity of blood. This condition can be seen with existing Hepato - sptenomegally in leukemias and will result in Internal haemorhage, bleeding through orifices and finally death, showing signs of Tridoshaja Raktha Pitha. Pandu Tridosh a Rakthapitha (bleeding disorder) Rishta (signs of death) - These complications may be seen together in a patient. It is of utmost importance that the physician can predict the path of the disease by keen observation of individual patient symptoms, trigger ing factors, genetics and existing complications. Each patient develops a separate pathway, the physician who can predict this pathway from the above factors can give apt treatment before manifesting to next stage. This is the 75primary goal of individualize d precision medicine. In Ayurveda, treatment is based on individual's state of health, his signs and symptoms and the strength of pathogenesis pathway and manifestation of disease in that particular individual. Two main type therapies namely, Shodhana (pur ifying therapy) and Shamana (pacifying therapy). Shodhana therapy which includes various procedure of panchakarma is done in comparatively healthy individuals. In cancer patients whose health immunity are severely compromised along with other complications only Shamana therapy is possible. By this we aim at reducing the severity of the disease and its complications. Prevent influx of other diseases by improving immunity along with the maintenance and healing of normal body hemostasis. Pandu is disease of Pi tha dosha predominance. The symptoms are consistent with reduced metabolism reduced blood production and loss of Immunity. In Ayurveda Pitha and Raktha (blood) are considered relatively proportional (Asraya - Ashrayi bandha) as Pitha is formed in Pandu, Pitha is vitiated and Raktha is reduced which is a paradox. Why is this happening? Blood (Raktha) is formed from food broken down by Metabolic fire (agni). The Rasa (food) is broken into nourishment part (sara) of wasteful part (Kitta). Due t o reduced Metabolic fire Raktha Sara is reduced and Raktha Mala is formed in abundance. As a result of this, blood nourishment is reduced and causes reduction in blood whereas the wasteful part is increased resulting in increased Pitha which is formed from Raktha Mala. Treatment is aimed at empowering the pacifying the vitiated pitha and kapha doshas also routing the normal movement of vata in the body. In order to improve immunity and health Rasayana (rejuvenation therapy) drugs are i ncluded in treatment. In this subject Myelo dysplastic syndrome (MDS) tiredness, Hepato splenomegally, dyspnea Haemoglobin 4 -6% (normal 13 -18%), Platelets - 40,000(normal 1.5 - 5 lakhs) and WBC count - 1000-2000 (normal (5000 -10000). He had severe anaemia thrombocytopenia and was doing blood transfusions at 8 -10 per month. Because of the presence of dyspnea, oedema and hepoto - splenomegally - This essentially means his treatment has to be increasing Agni and pacifying kapha dosha. Even though he had very low petichae, purpura or other hemorhagic symptoms (Raktha absent. Because of t hese reasons kalyanaka grthm which is a primary choice medicine in Pandu and unmada (Mental disorders) was used for its immunological, metabolic and anti oedematous action. It is a wonder drug used in many diseases including erection and infertility issues and is seen in many cases to improve haemopoesis (blood formation), 2.5 gm of the medicine was given with 2.5 Terminalia chebula powder hour before food twice daily. The dosage and choice of ghee has to be precise in cancer patient because due to reduced digestive fire it can result in worsening of symptoms. Trial and error is not advisable in a cancer patient as an error may result in ending a family's hope forever. Along with this Kalyanakam Kashayam was given with Chandraprabha tablet. As for Rasayana d rug gandeera Rasayana (said in Sahasrayoga text) was used. Along with purified bhasmas of Abhraka and iron were used. Whereas for the 2-month baby who was suffering from an extremely aggressive and deadly form of Leukemia (AML M5B) showed redish hard mass all over body called Leukemia cuti. He was weak and his gums Swollen red. It is common in AML M5B the patient can bleed from mouth and other orifices. Rayyan was showing such signs along with deteriorating blood picture. His WBC count shot up from 1.2 lakh to 2.5 lakhs in two days, blast cell count was 86%. Another worrying factor was severe neutropenia 1% (normal 6075%) any slight infection and baby won't survive further. The baby literally had few more days to hold on. He was given Thiktaka grithm \u00bc teaspoon to tridosha Raktha Pitha and relat ed complications. a result of vitiations of vata and Pitha dosha the to Pandu Rakthapitha Ristha (Haemorhagic) - It is for pacifying bleeding and to reboot haemopoesis the former drugs were used. Thiktaka grithm is an excellent medicine for pandu and Rakthapitha along with its anti inflammatory action. Chyavanaprash is the medicine of gods. It purifies Vata -Raktha, improves metabolic fire rejuvenates organ in children (balanama Vardhanam). The chyavanaprash made from indigenous Amla (emblica officianalis) and organic ingredients under fire burnt with medicinal - woods prepared with precise traditiona l methods under watchful eyes is of a different pedigree and potency. Drakshadi kwatha 8 ml. was given twice daily. Also 50 mg of Iron, Abhraka (mica), Swarnamakshika bhasmas with honey. All the drugs of choice were precisely included to both patients in a ccordance to textual references and individual patient conditions. The entire process is elaborate and beyond the scope of this article. Medicine was given to both patient's and was advised to take blood tests after 10 days. Both patients had no other medi cal options left in the world both were dying. All cancer patients are advised to practise mindfulness by Yoga or pramayama and individual diet habit modifications according to their climate, food and social upbringing are mandatory. Both these cases are l iterally incurable by any medicines anywhere in the world and yet how did this happen? There are 2 theories that explain this process. 1. Immune Theory - The Immune system reboots and rejuvenated by medicine food regime starts clearing off cancer cells. The i mmune system is our primary and only weapon against cancer in the years to come. That is the sole reason oncology is visioning towards targeted immune, therapy. Susrutha when he describes the treatment regime for Arbuda. Suggests, One should better the health and Immune system (bala) of the patient as that bala ( Immune system) itself will clear the disease from its roots \u2014\" Tad rakshitam Vyadhi balam According to mordern Embryology blood formation takes place in th e liver and Spleen of the embryo between 2 -7 months of fetus life. After birth Haemopoetic stem cells are transferred to bone marrow where blood formation is continued in adult life. But during diseases affecting the bone marrow like Neoplasms, blood produ ction is altered. To counter this,the body starts producing blood components from hematopoietic stem cells present in liver - spleen, lungs and kidneys. This process is pronounced in diseases like Myelofibrosis and can result in pleurisy and other complica tions due to blood production in lungs. These healthy hematopoietic stem cells get transported to the bone marrow by blood which can potentially regenerate and reboot the system. When Susrutha explains organogenesis in fetus he notes that Yakrit (liver) Pleeha (Spleen) - Raktha (blood) spleen, and lungs during organogenesis arc closely retated to Raktha (blood) in their development and formation. When the body gets cleared of blasts by immune system along with healthy stem cells present in circulation the chances of rebooting haemopoeisis become greater. The chance of this happening in a newborn are higher because of his undeveloped immune system. All the medicines and regimes of therapy are aimed at bringing this natural hemostasis in body. Standardized medicine was introduced to accommodate and minimize clinical error in 3rd world countries. In diseases caused by microbe s like bacteria and viruses, 100 cases can be tested and treated with a single drug. This is effective in community medicine. But in diseases of Auto Immune 77origin each individual cause, symptoms and pathogenesis vary accordingly. We cannot treat -everyone who has-Rheumatism with -same drug and regime. Individual complications like diabetes, Piles, thyroid co-exist often and every individual has to be treated as a separate entity or system. This type of approach in which individual genetics, habits and, path ogenesis are precisely noted in treatment, diet - habit modifications done according to individual specifications is called precision medicine. Modern world has entered into precision medicine in Auto Immune related diseases in the past decade, but in India it will take time to establish it. Ayurveda has been a pioneer in Precision medicine based on individual patient specifications since 5000 yrs. Ayurveda is a \"Sidhantha\" means something that is proved over time by several experimentations and established over cause - effect relationship. Here individual symptoms of subjects were noted, their pathogenesis pathway assessed (samprapthi) and in accordance to that, Individual medicine and diet - habit regimes were done. A sidhanta is known and understood by the effect it produces. Here the effect of Ayurveda sidhanta is the life of the subjects. Ayurveda is a way of life, its primary aim is to give vitality and longevity without diseases. A true purpose of life, physically active life style and healthy diet are k ey to prevent diseases especially cancers. A low calorie vegetarian diet is the best anti inflammatory diet possible. Processed meat used in burger, pepperoni, pizza, Sausages are classified as group I carcinogen by WHO. Tobacco, asbestos and Plutonium are the other group I carcinogens. 'Yes, you heard that correct \"plutonium\" and \"tobacco\" are as cancerous as processed meat. Chicken, Beef, Mutton all meats have dead meat bacterial toxins that trigger a cascade of Inflammation. In fact, chicken when cooked has greater amounts of carcinogen Heterocyclic amines than beef and is in par with cholesterol content in beef. Each 50g portion of processed meat daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 %. One serving of meat per day increases risk of diabetes by 51 percent based on harward research paper. It is the gluten, meat and dairy that kill you. Going on vegetarian diet and cassein free can infact reverse Autoimmune pathology and even reverse mutation. Yes you heard it right healthy diet, changes gut mi crobe structure which can actually correct mutations and Auto immunity. Food alone has capacity to reverse mutations, imagine the potential results when we involve mindfulness and physical activity the possibilities of prevention and cure become endless wh en supplemented with rejuvenating Ayurvedic therapy. In cancer care our primary goal is prevention, then comes curing and palliation. Ayurveda has endless possibilities in Auto immune diseases and oncology. The plant cannabis has huge role to play in furth er improving cancer care and palliation. It is a wonder drug used in Ayurveda for thousands of years. It is used as a sedative, pain relief, immune system booster for anxiety, nausea related to chemotheraphy and dozens of other uses. The opiates and morphi ne use by modern medicine sustains its palliative care. Let me assure you my friends when medical marijuana is legalized for oncology and chronic illness, Ayurveda will be a pioneer in global oncology care. The formulations like \"madanakameswari\" said in s ahasrayoga text in which cannabis is a main ingredient known for its aphrodesiac properties is a great pain reliever and has anticancer immune modulating properties and will be a major player in Leukemia related complications. This is just a tip of the ice berg, imagine the many traditional formulations with cannabis, have to offer. This has to be of prime importance in political, humanitarian and medical level. All India Institute of medical science, Ayush department and the best Ayurveda oncologists should join hands for research, on the subject of Curative and palliative care by Ayurveda supplemented with medical marijuana use. This is future, India have the potential might of unmountable traditional knowledge that can be supplemented by modern methods. Ayurveda is based on individual's system, pathogenesis undergoes in accordance to the overall health and disease condition which is understood by the effects they produce according to Ayurveda Sidhantha In the years to come India will epitomize global oncology care, at the helm of prevention and care will be Ayurveda. When this is perceived in reality we are gonna see a renaissance of incredible beauty. CONCLUSION Mechanisms of origin and cellular immunology of AML and MDS are yet to be elucidated with complete certainty. They are heterogeneous conditions and can present in varied ways. It is only after 78the nosologic limits of these entities are fully delineated that strict criteria can be laid out for their management. Individualized therapy can be expected t o provide significant relief in patients. The benefit of standardized protocol medicine is minimal in immune system related malignant conditions. So the new approach of precision medicine which take into account individualistic genes, environment and habits are the way forward. Both subjects 8-week old baby with AML M5B and 49 years old with MDS were successfully managed with precision Ayurveda therapy. Refractive Cytopenia were corrected, blast cell percentage in circulation were reduced and all physical s ymptoms were improved. Complete remission was seen in AML M5B and MDS. No signs of relapse are noted in both cases for over 7 years in the former and 5 years with the latter. Both subjects continue to be healthy even after stopping medication for over 2 ye ars. Ayurveda in its full essence aims at this precision approach in healing. 79 ABSTRACTS OF ORAL PRESENTATIONS 80SESSION 1 THEME: \"SCOPE OF INTEGRATION IN CANCER MANAGEMENT WITH AYURVEDA\" 1. Evaluation of Management of Stress in Cancer Patients through Shirodhara W.S.R. to Cancer Metastasis Panchakarma All India Institute of Ayurveda) ABSTRACT - The psychosocial factors on the development and progression of cancer has been a longstanding hypothesis since ancient times. In fact, epidemiological and clinical studies over past 30 years have provided strong evidence for links between chronic stress , depression, social isolation and cancer progression. By contrast, there is only limited intervention for managing behavioral factors in cancer progression. The major cause of death in cancer is metastasis that is resistant to conventional therapy. The ou tcome of cancer metastasis depends on multiple interactions between metastatic cells and homeostatic environment of the body. Epinephrine Norepinephrine Cortisol Catecholamine's are known to be elevated in individuals with stress. The physiological stress response is thought to be one of the likely mediators in cancer progression, Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis is considered to be the main neurophysiological mechanism of Shirodhara, the tactile stimulation of skin or hair follicles innervated by Trigeminal cranial nerve stimulate the thalamus and provide the subject an altered state of consciousness and a relief from anxiety, stress and depression. Other route from the principal nucleus to the reticular formation and posterior region of thalamus, which is Centre of autonomic nervous system, would be possible. This provides changes in autonomic nervous balance, Shirodhara can be treated as a good option to prevent stress and maintain homeostasis. KEY WORDS - Dr of Salyatantra, Sree Narayana Institute of Ayurvedic Studies and Research, Puthur Abstract The present era researches and advancements in the field of Medical Oncology emphasizes in the prevention of cancer rather than its management. Prostate cancer is estimated to be 20% out of the total cancer cases reported among me n in India. The exact cause for carcinogenesis/ oncogenesis/t umorogenesis is unknown. Rudolf Virchow was the first to find a positive association between inflammation and cancer in 1863. Recent studies conducted, demonstrated that there is a significant positive relation between prostatitis and prostate cancer, which indicate that inflammatory mediators promotes prostatic carcinogenesis via multiple signaling pathways. This study reviewed available literatures of the above -mentioned studies and correlated the mentioned parameters with the concepts of Ayurveda , to draw probable correlations such as Mutraghata and its dosha-dushya involvement. A retrospective study was also conducted among 5 reported cases of Prostate cancer in Department of Salyatantra , Sree Narayana Institute of Ayurvedic Studies and Research (SNIASR) during the year 2018-2019 that helped in substantiating the hypothesis of previous studies. A survey among 10 eminent physicians in the field of treatment of Prostatitis and Prostate cancer was conducted, to compile effective management protocols in Prostatitis. Thus, the study puts forward a management protocol for Chronic Prostatitis that can act as a preventive modality in the progression of Prostate Cancer. Keywords : Chronic Prostatitis, Prostate Cancer, Mutraghata 813. Role of Kalpa Chikitsa in the management of lynch syndrome - a case report Dr Pooja Sharma, PG Scholar, All India institute of Ayurveda Abstract: Background -Lynch syndrome (hereditary non -polyposis colorectal cancer) is an autosomal dominant condition and it is caused by germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes. Case presentation -A 28-year-old male was diagnosed with lynch syndrome in 2016. Patient was operated 3 times followed by chemotherapy. In 2019, he was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and advised for surgery. But despite of getting surgery patient prefer to take Ayurvedic consultation considering his miserable condition after previous surgeries. Decided to give the kalpa method of therapy prescribed in Ayurveda for rejuvenation and overall improvement of health. Result -After the 15 days of treatment with Kalpa chikitsa, the patient showed significant improvement in quality of life (p<0.001 for SPF) and CT abdomen showed reduct ion in circumferential thickening from 2.8cm to 1.5 cm (~ 50% improvement) with no worsening complications. Conclusion - Although the pathogenesis cannot be done revert back to the normalcy as the patient already had resection of total colon, but it can b e concluded that with the help of Ayurveda, appearance of complications can be delayed and quality of life can be improving in such patients. Key-words: Lynch syndrome, Madhuyasti Ksheerpaka, kalpa chikitsa 4. \"A Comparative study to assess the effect of Draksha -guduchyadi kavala in oral side effects of Radiotherapy in non -metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck\" (Dr Saniya C K1, Dr Mangalagowri Singh4) Abstarct Introduction -Annually around 5 .5 lakhs new cases of head and neck cancers are reported worldwide. Early stage management modality of HNSCC involves surgery, followed by Radiotherapy (RT) or Chemo-Radiation, depending on the histopathological findings, which can provide a better functio nal outcome. But usually RT may result in poor quality of life with side effects like mucositis, xerostomia, pharyngitis, laryngitis, pain etc. Methods -A comparative case study was done, comprising of 4 patients undergoing RT and 2 patients each were rando mly allocated into the study group and control group. The control group was given Sodium bicarbonate - salt solution mouth wash from the first day of radiation and were asked to perform 10 gargles a day throughout the RT and for 1.5 months thereafter. The study group were given the Draksha -guduchyadi yoga for kavala in the same manner and their effect were compared for the variables i.e. oral mucositis, and pain a ssessment was done by VAS scale. Result -After assessing the scoring of 5 variables, the reduction in mucositis, xerostomia, laryngitis, pharyngitis, pain and improvement in quality of life were significant in the study group compared to the control group. Conclusion -The Draksha -guduchyadi kavala yoga is helpful in reducing the complications of RT without any side effects and also enhances the general quality of life. Therefore, the kavala is a better alternative for oral side effects of RT, compared to the existing remedies. Keywords: Kavala, mouth wash, mucositis, xerostomia, laryngitis, pharyngitis, pain, quality of life. 825. Need for awareness of organic or natural food among medical practitioners. Vd. Sushrut Dilip Gadgil, PG scholar - Vd. Mihir S. Hajarnavis Many technological advances are being done in different fields of science, agriculture, medicine etc. The most dangerous and harmful diseases like cancer, diabetes are increasing in the population. The society and the medical professionals are not aware about the causes of these diseases and they and their close relatives are susceptible to these diseases. So there is a dire need to educate medical professionals even from Ayurvedic stream, for natural food to mainta in health. The food hybridization and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides are done since almost fifty years in the world. About fifty years ago there was natural, healthy, organic food available everywhere. As the science advanced and many inven tions and researches were done in the fields of agriculture lot of efforts were taken to increase crop yield by unnatural way. Genetic mutations, biotechnological use are some examples of this. The crops were made such that they will not have further repro ductive capacity or fertilizing capacity. The farmers also were encouraged to farm such genetically modified seeds to yield more and to have more money. Thus the basic need of mankind that is the food got vitiated by these chemical fertilizers and pesticid es. To overcome these hazardous food effects Subhash Palekar has started an aggressive step against unnatural farming. He has motivated many farmers from Maharashtra to have natural farming only. Thus need of awareness about organic or natural food for th e medical practitionres will be explained in the paper presentation. 6.

Psychological Healing in Oncology - In Purview of Epigenetics Dr. Sharma Akanksha1, Dr. Department of Rachana Sharir, CBPACS, New Delhi; 2. Assistant Professor (MD, PhD), PG Department of Rachana Sharir, CBPACS New Delhi. Abstract: Cancer is a disease which manifests not only at physical level but at psychological level also. Stress is one of the major ca use as well as major symptom after manifestation of this dreadful disease. Previous studies have revealed that stress can trigger the causation of cancer by changing the genetic expression. Considering the impact of stress as one of the major cause and as major symptom and aggravating factor, non -pharmacological interventions to heal the subtle body is of equal importance as pharmacological interventions. These non pharmacological interventions for example - Prana healing, Aura cleansing, Chakra healing & various other forms of bioenergetics medicine are of great potential for the psychological healing in oncology. S tress can damage the Aura, causing gaps and interrupting Prana, the life-force. Patient will be treated with various unconventional therapies t o control the defect in brain controlling mechanism through the stimulation of Chakras known as \"Psychoneurotherapy\". Method- Meta-Analysis; Aim & Objective - To describe briefly the continuum of ecology - biology- genetic and energetic process of life and t heir application in Oncology. Conclusion -. Thus, it can be concluded that the application of Shadchakra pranic healing as a noninvasive, non pharmacological intervention in reduction of stress, which is cause itself, & one of the major symptom of cancer is of great potential in oncology.

Evaluation of Deepan karma of \"Lavan Adrak\" through pH and Chromatography and its Role in Prevention of Cancer w.s.r Gastrointestinal of Swasthvritta, All India Institute of Ayurveda, Sarita Vihar, New Delhi Email:drankita712@gmail.com BACKGROUND: Dietary habits are directly related with in creased incidence of cancer worldwide, due their negative effect (Mandaagni) on metabolism. Adrak (Zinziber officinalis Rose.), a tropical and subtropical cultivated plant, derived from Zingerberaceae family and has been used worldwide as spice, dietary su pplement and traditional medicine. As per Classical text \"Lavan Adrak\" (Ginger and rock salt) is prescribed before meal, to improve the taste sensation & to enhance Appetite, due to its Deepan karma but the evidences for the same are not available. pH valu e and Drug profile has to be generated to establish the deepan karma of lavanadrak. Cancer can be prevented with prolonged use of lavanadrak before meal as its increase the metabolism. OBJECTIVE: This study has been conducted to evaluate and pH and HPTLC o f lavanadrak and establishing its Deepan karma for prevention of Cancer. METHODOLOGY: Sample of Adrak and lavan (Rock salt) was purchased from local market. Both the sample subjected to pH analysis and HPTLC in single and with combination in the Laboratory of AIIA as per API guidelines. RESULTS: Detailed finding will be presented in 2 -DG AMALGAMATION INHIBITS ANCHORAGE - INDEPENDENT GROWTH OF MALIGNANT GLIOMA CELLS aKavita Peter, bRagini Gothalwal, cPuneet and Head, Deptt. of Biotechnology, cProf. and Head, Department of Research, Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre, Bhopal Objective: (GSCs) and glial (GSLCs) are a major hurdle in glioblastoma (GB) therapy because of the inherent resistance mechanism. Efforts to mitigate resistance and relapse have led to the development of combination therapy to induce tumor and stem-cell death and have the potential to improve cancer therapeutics. The current initiative was to investigate the anti -stemness effect of the natural polyphenol curcumin (CUR); in combination with 2 -deoxyglucose (2DG), a glucose analog and glycolytic inhibitor , on human GB cells. Methods: U-87 GB tumor cells were treated singularly with CUR, 2 -DG, and CURplus 2 -DG for 48hr. Cell cycle inhibition was assessed by flow cytometry to look for distribution of cells in different phases of division on treatment. The tumorigenicity of the cells was evaluated by clonogenic assay and soft agar assay for the anchorage dependent and anchorage independent clone forming capacity, respectively. Results: Earlier, we have established that the combination of 2 -DG and Cur is synergistic for inhibition of proliferation and cell migration. The combination arrested the cells in G2/M phase and also inhibited the anchorage independent and anchorage dependent clone forming capacity which is characteristic of GSCs . Conclusion : This novel combination exhibited the potential to inhibit GSCs responsible for relapse and resistance. The study suggests that tailor -made combination using established drugs can target multiple signaling molecules to yield optimal therapeutic outcome and is the right approach to address resistance in GB. 4. IN VITRO ANTICANCER STUDY OF VARIOUS EXTRACTS OF ECLIPTA ALBA Hassk. ON HEPATIC CANCER Ningappa3 1. PG Scholar (Dravyaguna), 2. Professor and Head of Department, (Dravyaguna), 3. Director, MGM'S institute of biosciences and technology, Aurangabad, Maharashtra 431001 ABSTRACT : Synthetic anticancer drugs, apart from their high cost are well acknowledged for their u nwarranted side effects. We studied the effects of four different extracts of Bhringraj - Eclipta alba Hassk., in the hepatic cancer cell line - (HepG2). Apart from the studies for the phytochemical analysis, TLC, HPLC analysis to test active chemical comp onents in the ethanol, methanol, aqueous and petroleum -ether extracts of Bhringraj , we have evaluated these extracts for their activities against HepG2. We have used the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay for the investigation of cytotoxicity produced by the dif ferent extracts of Bhringraj in HepG2 cell line, as it is the most preferred and cost -effective method of screening. After the evaluation of the percentage of cell growth and cell viability values from the SRB assay, it was revealed that the percentage of growth inhibition were 79.33%, 77.36%, 68.74% and 55.06% for ethanol, methanol, aqueous and petroleum ether respectively. From the analysis of the results, we have reached to a conclusion that the ethanol extract of Eclipta alba Hassk. is in possession of highly significant anti -cancer activity in comparison to other three extracts of Eclipta alba Hassk. KEY WORDS - Ethanol, Methanol, Eclipta alba Srb assay, HepG2 cell line. 855. In vivo anticancer activity and toxicity of Ayurveda compound W.S.R. to leukemia Dr. Monika Sharma, Ph. D Scholar, Department of Agad Tantra, National Institute of Ayurveda, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India Introduction : A diseased caused by an uncontrolled division of abnormal cells in any tissue of any organ of the body is called c ancer. There are various types of cancers on the basis of primary abnormal growth in tissues. Leukemia is a type of cancer of blood, which is caused by the rapid production of abnormal white blood cell. In Ayurveda, the reference of the cancer and blood ca ncer is found indirectly under the heading of Arbuda (cancer) and Rakta Arbuda (leukemia), respectively. In Ayurveda, there are so many herbo mineral drugs that are useful in treating cancer. Aims and Objectives : 1. To study the in vivo anticancer (blood cancer) activity of Ayurveda compound. 2. To compare the toxicity of Ayurveda compound with in jection/tablet arsenic trioxide. 3. To evaluate, elaborate, and discuss the etiology of leukemia as per Ayurveda. Materials and Methods : An in vivo study was cond ucted in Institute of Biomedical and Industrial Research. The in vivo anti -leukemic effect was carried out by using benzene induced (carcinogen) model in Swiss albino mice and the acute toxicity study was conducted according to fixed single dose toxicity . The herbo mineral drugs have been prepared by using purified arsenic (arsenic trioxide), Vinca rosea, and Urginia indica to study in vivo antileukemic effect and toxicity. This study was conducted according to organisation for economic cooperation and development Guidelines 423 and the antileukemic activity was carried out by benzeneinduced leukemia in albino mice after animal ethical clearance. Result: The highest dose of the test drug (2000 mg/kg) in the acute toxicity study shows minimal adverse ef fect of toxicity on liver and no adverse effect was found on kidney and spleen. The result was found better in study group 1 having myelocytic leukemia than study group 2 having lymphocytic leukemia. Conclusion: The effect of study drug shows good antileuk emic activity, although standard drug was found better than study drug. Overall, the study was found safe and effective on blood cancer.

(Patha) extract on human and animal derived cancer cell lines using proteomics as Fundamental Research (CCRAS) , Pune-411038. ABSTRACT Among the various plants attributed for possessing anti -cancer potential, Patha has been reported to be used in the management of Gulma (~Abdominal tumor/swelling) in Bhavprakash nighantu. In the present study, anticancer potential and the mechanism of action of Cissampelos pareira (L.) Poir. ( Patha) hydroalcoholic extract on human and animal derived cancer cell lines was deciphered through proteomics as a tool. Cancer cell lines viz., Breast Cancer -MCF7, Liver Cancer -Chang Liver, Cervical Cancer -HeLa, Pancreatic Cancer - RIN5F and Mesenchymal Stem cells -MSC were treated with different concentrations of extracts. To decipher the anticancer potential of extracts -caspase analysis were employed. Further, proteome level analysis was conducted in order to probe into the mechanism of action of plant extract on cancer cell lines. Proteome extraction was carried out for untreated and treated samples in RIN5F cell line, and quantified samples were subjected to in -solution digestion prior to MS analysis. Out of four cancer cell lines, the extract has shown potent anticancer activity ag ainst RIN5F with IC 50 value being at 37.5\u00b5g/ml, whereas no cytotoxicity was observed in MSC normal control cell line, indicative of selective cytotoxicity against pancreatic cancer. DNA fragmentation assay and Multi -caspase analysis resulted in affirmation of mode of action of plant extracts via apoptosis induction. The proteomic analysis yielded the evidence of probable mode of action i.e. the apoptotic pathway activation mediated by p53 upregulation in pancreatic cancer cell line. 86 7. Exploring the mechanism of action of Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Del, (Ingudi) extract on human and animal derived cancer cell lines using cell based assays Institute for Fundamental Research (CCRAS, New Delhi under Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India), Nehru Garden, Gandhi Bhavan, Kothrud, Pune -411038. ABSTRACT Many plants are known to have anticancer effects according to ancient Ayurvedic text. They are known to reduce the proliferation of cells and the size of tumor after treatment. However, their mode of pharmacological action is yet to be elucidate d. The present study has e xplored the mechanism of action of Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Del, (Ingudi) hydroalcoholic extract on human and animal derived cancer cell lines using cell based assays and proteomic tools . Cancer cell lines viz., Breast Cancer -MCF 7, Liver Cancer -Chang Liver, Cervical Cancer -HeLa, Pancreatic Cancer -RIN5F and Mesenchymal Stem cells - MSC (normal control) were treated with different concentrations of extract. The cytotoxic activity was analyzed by using MTT cytotoxicity assay. The cytot oxic activity was ensured with cell death via apoptotic pathway, using two methods viz., DNA fragmentation assay and Multi -caspase analysis. In order to decrypt the molecular mechanism of action of plant extract on cancerous cell line, proteome level analy sis was mandatory. Thus, proteome extraction was carried out for untreated and treated samples, and quantified samples were subjected to in -solution digestion prior to LCMS analysis. The extract has shown anticancer activity against all the cell lines used under the study (IC 50 values being 30\u00b5g/ml for MCF7, 30\u00b5g/ml for Chang Liver, 60\u00b5g/ml for for RIN5F). DNA fragmentation assay and Multi -caspase analysis resulted in affirmation of mode of action of plant extracts is via apoptosis induction. The proteomic analysis yielded the evidence of probable mode of action i.e. the apoptotic pathway activation mediated by p53 upregulation. SESSION 3 \"UPDATE & SCOPE OF RESEARCH IN INTEGRATIVE ONCOLOGY\" 1. POSSIBLE ROLE OF KAVALA, GANDOOSHA IN ORAL CANCER LESIONS AT VARIOUS STAGES. Dr. Amrish P. Dedge, Research Officer (Ay.), CCRAS, Ministry of AYUSH. ABSTRACT Introduction - As per Globocan 2018 data, oral cancer is the most common cancer in India amongst men and the second most common cancer in India amongst women (16.1 % and 10.4 % of all cancers respectively). Kavala, Gandoosha procedures mentioned in Ayurveda can contribute at various levels in management of oral cancer and oral lesions. Methods- A comprehensive literature review of Kavala, Gandoosha procedures from classics and published research evidences is performed. Discussion - Kaval, gandoosha can be introduced with integrative approach at various levels like primary prevention in susceptible population, secondary prevention in remission cases, management of active lesions, management of precancerous lesions like OSMF, treatment hazards like radiation induced oral mucositis, lesions of left out cases for pain management and palliative care etc. Classical medicinal regimes like decoction, medicated oils, ghees, honey, milk ca n be used according to symptoms and dosha specificity of lesion. Along with appropriate classical formulations as per the indications, evidence based drugs like Curcuma for Kavala, gandoosha . Subjective (like EORTC scoring) and objective assessment (imaging, histopathological evaluation) will be the standard treatment outcomes to assess efficacy. Case studies, case series followed by pilot studies may provid e further directions for well designed clinical tri als with integrative approach.

Most of the theories that have been offered regarding the causes of cancer fall into one of the following categories. 1. Embryoni c 2. Bio-chemical 3. Infectious agents & 4. Genetic. Ayurveda can play a big role in the last causative factor, namely genetic. A person's health depends on his 'constitution' by which he is born and the way in which he adapts himself to his environment. Constitution explains his achievements in 'Health' and defeats in 'Disease'. Aims: To study the Dehaprakriti in subjects of Mamsarbuda (Myoma). Study design: In this overall study, clinically diagnosed 30 patients of Mamsarbuda (Myoma) were selected for the purpose of cross sectional study. Result: Among 30 Mamsarbu da (Myoma) patients 53% were Pitta-Kaphaja Vata-Pittaja. Conclusion: It is observed to develop 883. ROLE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF GARBHASHAYA ARBUDA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO UTERINE CANCER Dr. Priyanka Hajare*, Dr. K. Bharathi** *M.S Final Professor Prasuti tantra & Stri roga dept, National Institute of Ayurveda, Jaipur ABSTRACT - \"Arbuda\" is a disease which grows very fast and causes either destruction of local tissues or body part or even death. In India, uterine cancer ranks 3rd among genital malignancy next to cervix and ovary. Uterine cancer differentiated into 2 types on the basis of their site of origin. One is endometrial cancer, most common form of uterine cancer and accounts for 95% of all the cases. Second is Uterine sarc oma (mamsaja arbuda ), initiates in other tissues or muscles of uterus and accounts for 5% of all uterine cancer cases. The symptoms of uterine cancer includes - excessive and prolonged menstrual bleeding, watery -sticky foul smell discharge per vagina, bleed ing after coitus and pain in lower abdomen.

ABIDING AYURVEDA PRINCIPLES IN CANCER PAIN MANAGEMENT: A CASE SERIES. Dr Santosh F. Patil, Consultant, Abhaya Cancer care OPD KLE Ayurveda Hospital, Assistant Professor Department of Agadatantra, KAHER's Shri B M Kankanawadi Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya, Belagavi, Karnataka -590003 Pain management in cancer is always a taxing phenomenon as 43.3 % patients remain undertreated in spi te of updated guidelines. A systematic review says that patient experience pain at different phases like during treatment (59%), after curative treatment (33%), advanced stage (64%) and in survivors (5 -10%). Pain interferes in daily activities of patients to compromise quality of life and succumb emotionally. Pain could be due to visceral, neuropathic or treatment induced, Opioids remain as last stay with their own limitations requiring rescue. Integrated oncology says pain is multidimensional requiring mul tidisciplinary approach. We report five cases of head and neck cancer having pain and generalised weakness as major complaints, associated with oral mucositis, reduced appetite and sleepafter receiving conventional treatment. They were managed with ghrita preparations by shamanasneha, bastichikitsa and raktamokshana. It was noteworthy to understand that VAS score of paincomes down with shamanasnehapana and raktamokshana.

Research Officer (A yu.), Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Nutritional Disorders, CCRAS, Hospital, HP ABSTRACT Incurable and debilitating disease are often associated with many suffering. Sufferings like pain, nausea, vomiting, ulcers, limb paralysis, anxiety, depression etc. make life unbearable not only to person but also for family. These sufferings have gross impact on social, financial, emotional and spiritual issues. Families often get financially ruined; losing their homes, going to debt, all these because high treatment costs add to the problem and sometimes the sufferer is family's wage -earner. Palliative care is an approach that is focused on people living with serious illness irrespective of the diagnosis or prognosis. Its motive is to improve quality of life of a patient and their family through early identification, correct assessment and treatment of p ain and other suffering, whether physical, psychosocial or spiritual. According to World Health Organization (WHO) palliative care fact sheet (February 2018), every year an estimated 40 million people are in need of palliative care, 78% of whom live in low - and middle -income countries. Although country specific data is not available, this also reflects need and concern disproportionate for palliative care in India. In December 2015, the Kerala government roped in Ayurveda doctors to offer palliative care to patients suffering from long -term illnesses who required home visits. How Ayurveda health care provider treated bed sores of 75 years old bed ridden diabetic female patient with Triphla -quath gives boost to Ayurveda professionals for looking further scope s and opportunities in palliative care. No system is perfect in providing health care needs. We have to spotlight best of each system to fulfill lacunae. As popularly said: \"strength in unity\" fits true here. For beneficence of terminally ill person, all s ystems have to come forward and agree with that integration is proven best for patient care. This article is written in an attempt to explore such scopes and opportunities in Ayurveda for delivering palliative care nationwide.

ROLE OF AYURVEDA IN MANAGEMENT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA: A CASE STUDY Dr Peeyush Kaushik MD, Fellowship scholar, Ayurveda Oncology, KAHER's adi Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya, Belagavi, Karnataka -590003 Introduction Multiple myeloma which represents 1.8 % newly diagnosed cancer cases is relatively uncommon1, which affects the plasma cells, leading to proliferation and accumulation of defective immunoglobulins in bone marrow and later infiltrating to other organs2. Case study In the present study a 60-year-old male patient diagnosed with Multiple myeloma in January, 2017 visited Abhaya cancer OPD in June, 2017. Rasayana management of this patien t was planned as per the symptoms and dhatu involvement. He was treated with various Rasayu herbomineral formulations compoun ds. The aim of the treatment was to improve the QOL of the patient with symptomatic reform. Though \"Vyadhipratyanik Chikitsa\" was not the primary goal however it was kept on check and results were obtained in the scope of disease stability. During the treatment, the patient's liver and kidney profile was also followed up to check the safety of the drugs used and it was markedly reported to be stable during the whole follow up period of 30 months. The tumor marker profile including 2microglobulin, IgG, IgM, IgA, free light chain, free light chain and / ratio were tested every 3 -6 moths. Results and Discussion - During the course of follow up his symptoms were regularly checked to corroborate his quality of life (QOL) and ECOG was consistently observe d to get the precise idea of life style improvement. As per patient he was satisfied with his life and felt comfortable in pursuing his job and routine activities. Though some age related symptoms occur occasionally but overall improvement in this patient is remarkable. Multiple herbomineral formulations were used for a long duration but no damage to any vital organ (has been observed which indicates the safety and efficacy of herbomineral preparations in chronic disease management. A combination of oral cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, and bortezomib in 50 patients with relapsed/refractory MM has been reported to achieve ORR in 88% of patients, with a median event -free survival of 10 months and median overall survival not yet reached6. The subject was refra ctory to bortezomib, that makes the OS to be 15.2 months but the subject followed up for 30 months of event free survival with very good QOL and ECOG 0. All of his complains has subsided with occasional episodes of body ache and sleep disturbances that can be attributed to season change and Paricharya. His liver and kidney profile was stable throughout the follow up period so it can be concluded that herbomineral preparations are safe to use in multiple myeloma cases. At the time of his first consultation h e had very high levels of 2 microglobulins but during the course of medication the levels fluctuated as were the symptoms but stayed on lower side also other tumor markers like Kappa free light chain and Lambda free light chain immunoglobulin were within limits. Conclusion The present study outcomes indicate towards an encouraging and valuable role of Ayurveda therapy in the management of refractory Multiple Myeloma. More work should be done to evaluate the actual efficacy and significance acquired by ado pting Ayurveda line of treatment instead of conventional methods in such cases and to establish a standard Ayurvedic protocol for the management of all three stages of Multiple Myeloma. 946.

THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF MARMA (VITAL POINTS IN AYURVEDA) FOR CANCER PAIN MANAGEMENT - A SYSTEMIC REVIEW Dr. Jagjeet Singh, Dr. Pooja Sabharwal, CBPACS , Delhi Cancer is the most vulnerable threat now days to the society. For cancer usually everyone choose pharmacological interventions like chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, surgery, medicine. But these pharmacological treatments do not always meet patient needs and may produce difficult side effects. In Cancer most threatful condition is pain and usually the analgesics which are given for pain management cause more side effects. So non pharmacological treatment (intervention) may provide more relief like acupuncture, oleation, touch healing etc. Most of the cancer hospitals now days have separate unit to render such kind of non - pharmacological services to canc er patients for pain management . One of th e non pharmacological approaches in Ayurveda is Marma therapy. These Marma therapies can help in reducing pain by providing mild pressure over vital points. As these vital points related to chakras and nadis which help in transferring prana over whole body . There is no direct mention of Marma therapeutic use in Ayurvedic literature but now day an effective therapy evolved i.e Marma therapy. Marma therapy is based on the utilization of 107 points in the body which are considered as access points to body, min d and consciousness. Marma points can be used to balance the tridosha and triguna. In Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India, these pressure points may be called as Marma, meaning \"vulnerable or sensitive zones\". Such points can be used specifically f or treating disease or generally for promoting health and longetivity. MethodA systematic review. Conclusion By offering treatment to cancer patients with intervention of Marma therapy may reduce the global burden of cancer treatment expenses. The further methodology related to intervention of Marma therapy will be discussed in full paper. Key words: Cancer, pain, Marma therapy 985. Scope of Palliative Care for Cancer Through Panchakarma Dr. Latika, PG Scholar, AIIA Introduction : Palliative care is a treatme nt that seeks to relieve suffering in patients. Cancer being a major illness and a leading cause of death worldwide the scope of Palliative care is too large. In modern medicine the line of treatment adopted for cancer is Chemotherapy and radiotherapy whic h are highly proved to have side effects. Those most commonly include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, alopecia, constipation, Sleep disturbance, anorexia, Fatigue etc. These arrays of side effects have a devastating effect on the quality of life of cancer sur vivors. It is moral responsibility of health care system to provide or make possible effort for betterment of terminally ill cancer patients . Ayurvedic principles has an immense contribution in various chronic disease in bettering the quality of life espe cially Panchakarma Therapies. Here, in this study Panchakarma procedures were reviewed in the context of their applicibality in palliative care in cancer to improve quality of life. Materials and Method: Various Ayurveda classical literature and modern lit erature along with published authentic sources from Internet were reviewed thoroughly to derive conclusions. Discussion : Palliative care through panchakarma in cancer is non -invasive and considered to be the best, since the side effects are reduced or erad icated. Need of the hour is to raise awareness and encourage implementation of Palliative care through external therapies (Panchakarma) for combating cancer and its side effects. Result: This review shows a good prospect of palliative care in cancer throug h Ayurveda with special reference to Panchakarma Therapies. 6. Role of Satvavajaya Chikitsa with special reference to Yoga in Cancer Care: A Review of the Evidence -based Research Dr Monika , PG Scholar, AIIA Cancer is one of the most feared diseases. Starting from the diagnosis of cancer, its progression (i.e., metastasis to bone and organs), adverse effects of its treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery), and diagnostic procedures (biopsies and radiological diagnostic scans) can cause physical, psychological, and emotional problems affecting patients&#39; quality of life (QOL). To cope with cancer and its treatment -related side effects and toxicities, people are increasingly using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Consequently, inte grative oncology, which combines conventional therapies and evidence -based CAM practices, is an emerging discipline in cancer care. The use of yoga as a CAM is proving to be beneficial and increasingly gaining popularity. Satvavajaya Chikitsa (Ayurvedic ps ychotherapy) is a nonpharmacological approach aimed at control of mind and restraining it from unwholesome Artha (objects) or stressors. Withdrawal of the mind from unwholesome objects is known as Sattvavajaya Chikitsa or it is a treatment by Self Control. Charaka defines it as a mind controlling therapy in which a stress has been laid on restraining of mind from unwholesome objects. Thus, it includes all the methods of Manonigraha and Astanga Yoga (Yogic techniques) too. Indian philosophy portrays Astanga Yoga as a primary tool to control mind; hence it can be used as Satvavajaya Chikitsa. A systemic review was done using free electronic databases PUBMED, google scholar ,scopus with key word yoga ,cancer care The retrieved article were evaluated for their s uitability .The matter was evaluated and analyzed critically on the prevalence of yoga&#39;s use in cancer patients so that oncologists, researchers, and the patients are aware of the evidence supporting the use of this relatively safe modality in cancer care. Key words : Yoga ,cancer care, quality of life 997. MULTIMODAL AYURVEDIC APPROACH IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CENTRAL NEUROCYTOMA - A CASE REPORT . Dr Mythri H S 1 , PG Scholar, AIIA Central Neurocytomas (CN) are rare, benign neoplasms of the central nervous system , comprising 0.25 -0.5% of brain tumours, often located in the lateral ventricles. Typically, benign, though atypical variants have been reported and believed to have potential for malignant transformation. The combined overall annual incidence is 0.032. Pe ak incidence is found at 20 -34 years of age, with higher incidence in Korea, India, and Japan. The symptoms of CN can be well correlated with Vatavyadhi especially due to Pittavrita Pra na and Pranavrita Vyana pathologies. The main goal of management of CN are gross total resection, adjuvant radiosurgery and radiotherapy. However, these treatment types may cause different side effects, and chemotherapy -based regimens appear to have reached a therapeutic plateau. Therefore, this rare case of CN which was man ged by mu ltimodal Ayurvedic therapies is being reported here. A 37 -year-old male approached the OPD of AIIA with the complaints of severe headache with heaviness in head, dizziness, nausea and forgetfulness in day to day activities, along with ocular comp laints like heaviness in eyes, blurred vision and diplopia for 45 days. For which patient was diagnosed as Central Nuerocytoma with punctate calcification and lateral ventriculomegaly through CECT Head. On th e basis of features patient was diagnosed with Pittavrita Prana Vatavyadhi after considering Rogi -Roga Pariksha. Patient the line of Pittaghna and Maruta avirodhi chikitsa with combination of herbal and herbo-mineral oral along with pa nchakarma, netra kriyakalpa and athyahara . Pre and post therapy assessment were done based on Karnofsky performance scale, NANO scale, MMSE and HVLT - revised scale. Post therapy assessment showed notable improvement in disease symptoms.

Cancer Risk factor for life : Role of Life Style *Dr.Suman Gihar, PG Scholar, AIIA. Development of Cancer is appreciated by unhealthy Lifestyle pattern and habits. The risk factor for cancer is numerous but life style is a preliminary stage of it for the prevalence purpose. We can reduce the threat of Cancer by enhancing and modif ied Lifestyle pattern. Ayurveda emphasized a special diet and life style pattern for every healthy a s well as diseased person. They are like take healthy foods and fresh one, regular exercise (Yoga and Pranayama), oil application locally as well as orally, Day regimens, Night regimens, season's re gimens etc. This article is all about the how the Ayurveda focus about life style and habits in Life Style Disorders like Canc er. The global cancer burden is estimated to have risen to 18.1 mi llion new cases and 9.6 million deaths in 2018. One in 5 men and one in 6 women worldwide develop cancer during their lifetime, and one in 8 men and one in 11 women die from the disease. In 2018, cancer took more than seven lakh lives in India. Thes e are excluding the two million more who continue to live and suffer from the deadly disease . According to the estimates by the Indian Council Medi cal Research (ICMR), the death toll is expected to rise to 8.8 lakh by 2020. This data shows all about the severity of Cancer but we still have a hope of life to the our cultural and spiritual and off course the ancient Science of gi ving the gift of health to both Healthy and diseased one by the lightening of Ayurveda. Key words - Risk factor, Day regimen, season regimen. 1009. ROLE OF PANCHAKARMA IN INTEGRATED CANCER REHABILITATION Dr.Uttamram Y adav, PG Scholar, AIIA Cancer diagnosis, including careful clinical and pathological assessments, is the first step to cancer management. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, it is necessary to determine the cancer stage, where the main goals are to aid in the choice of therapy, to determine prognosis, and to design tre atment protocols. Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer. The combined modality therapy has been responsible for improved survival rates in number of different forms of cancer. Treatment of cancer ranges from the use of powerful chemicals, bursts of radiation to complete removal of tumour and surrounding tissue. Each treatment type brings a certain level of risk, pain and disability to the patient, but malignant cells when left untreated inevitably choke off vital organs and circulation.
