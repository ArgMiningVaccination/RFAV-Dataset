We cannot continue on a path where pharma shareholders call the shots and women, minorities, and people in poorer countries suffer the consequences. We must break up monopolies, improve global research capacities, and support tech transfers that ramp up production of lifesaving vaccines, tests and treatments. Pandemics should not be a case of survival of the richest. Letter to leaders: end vaccine monopolies More than 130 former world leaders, Nobel laureates, leading scientists, economists, humanitarians, faith leaders, business leaders, trade unionists and celebrities call for urgent action to bring an end to the pandemic. They urge world leaders \"to do what is necessary to end this crisis\" and unite behind a People's Vaccine. Free from patents A people's vaccine, not a profit vaccine. \"A Covid-19 vaccine must be seen as a global public good, a people's vaccine\" - UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Global Vaccine Summit, 4 June 2020 Free from patents A people's vaccine, not a profit vaccine. The people's vaccine A growing movement of health and humanitarian organisations, past and present world leaders, health experts, faith leaders and economists urging that when safe and effective vaccines are developed they are produced rapidly at scale and made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge. We are calling on governments and pharmaceutical corporations to: Urgently agree and implement a global roadmap to deliver the WHO goal of fully vaccinating 70% of people by mid-2022. Maximise the production of safe and effective vaccines and other COVID-19 products by suspending relevant intellectual property rules and ensuring the mandatory pooling of all COVID-19 related knowledge, data and technologies so that any nation can produce or buy sufficient and affordable doses of vaccines, treatments and tests. Invest public funding now in a rapid and massive increase in vaccine manufacturing as well as research and development (R&D) capacity to build a global distributed network capable of and governed to deliver affordable vaccines as global public goods to all nations. Ensure COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and tests are sold to governments and institutions at a price as close to the true cost as possible, provided free of charge to everyone, everywhere, and allocated according to need. Scale up sustainable investment in public health systems. By agreeing to take these five clear steps for the world has the chance to turn this crisis around.

If you believe that access to healthcare is a human right, and that the world's approach to COVID-19 should prioritise people's lives, not profits for pharmaceutical companies, take action with us today.
