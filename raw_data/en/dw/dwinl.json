A main driver of the growth is the increase of various infectious diseases like influenza, swine flu, hepatitis, tuberculosis, diphtheria, Ebola, and meningococcal and pneumococcal diseases. The United States are the world's largest national market for vaccines, while [North America is, accordingly, the largest regional market](/statistics/270348/distribution-of-the-global-vaccine-market-by-region-in-2008/), followed by Europe.

The impact of vaccines Originally, the main aim of vaccinations (immunizations) was to prevent infections from certain diseases and thus to reduce outbreaks and larger epidemics within the population. Thanks to vaccines, infectious diseases which once had high death rates like polio and smallpox have been nearly eradicated. Others, like measles, mumps, [and whooping cough](/statistics/186705/new-cases-of-pertussis-in-the-us-since-1950/), are mostly under control. However, vaccines can also be used after an infection occurs as a therapeutic. [Therapeutic vaccines in immuno-oncology](/statistics/670707/percentage-of-cancer-immunotherapy-sales-by-type-worldwide/)are one of the latest big things in cancer treatment. "}
