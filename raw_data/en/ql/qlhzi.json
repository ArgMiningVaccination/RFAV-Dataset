[IV therapy](https://www.balancehormoneoklahoma.com/services/iv-therapy) for allergies can reduce allergy symptoms and help your immune system with powerful antioxidants and antihistamines that protect your body against allergy triggers. Our compassionate experts [Gordon Hart, PA-C](https://www.balancehormoneoklahoma.com/provider/gordon-hart-pa-c), and [Lisa Hargis, NP](https://www.balancehormoneoklahoma.com/provider/lisa-hargis), can help relieve your body and mind. At [Balance Hormone Center](https://www.balancehormoneoklahoma.com/about) in Norman, Oklahoma, we have the solutions you need to live your best life without allergy symptoms. How can IV therapy relieve allergies? When your body fights allergies, it triggers an immune response. That response depletes your body of fluids and nutrients as it expends them to protect you from a perceived pathogen. IV therapy for allergies provides your body with the resources it needs to keep protecting you, like fluids, vitamins, and minerals. Our IVs for allergy therapy include: - Vitamin B12 - Vitamin B complex - Magnesium - Vitamin C - Calcium - Saline - Zinc - Glutathione These components help your body rehydrate and reduce your histamine response, which means you experience fewer allergy symptoms. They also provide you with the nutrients you need to continue fighting allergies. The solution contains anti-inflammatory ingredients, like vitamin C, to boost your immunity and reduce the inflammation allergies cause in your body. What to expect from IV therapy treatment Your IV therapy allergy treatment depends on your personal needs. Not everyone gets the same amount because each person has different reactions to allergies and needs different immune support. To start, you come to our office once or twice a week until we see how the IV treatment affects and improves your allergy symptoms. Visits last 30-45 minutes. We insert the IV line into the inside bend of your elbow. From there, you can relax, read, use your laptop to get work done, or even nap. The IV solution flushes the allergens from your system, and over time, you start to feel better and experience fewer symptoms. IV therapy isn't a cure for allergies but a way to strengthen your body to fight them. You can use it by itself or together with other allergy treatments, if you have them, to support your immunity. How much IV therapy do you need? As we see how the IV treatments work for you, we create a suitable treatment schedule and determine your treatment frequency. Some people continue weekly treatments while others only need treatment once a month after the initial few weeks. At Balance Hormone Center, we administer IV therapy for allergies to help you enjoy life, even during allergy season.
