A major issue concerning emotional health is our tendency to deal with emotions episodically. Because our emotions tend to be cyclic and episodic, we are prone to deal with them in a similar manner. In reality, we should develop a model of consistency for emotional stability and health. I know of a few effective strategies that can be used to appropriately manage our emotions. First, we must control the amount of stress we experience and properly manage that stress on a daily basis. Second, we can utilize aromatic application of essential oils to stabilize our mood. Used in this way, essential oils can change the very nature of our body's chemistry and in turn, alter our emotional responses. Instead of only using essential oils episodically,I recommend incorporating essential oils with mood-stabilizing properties into your daily routine. Essential oils that fit into this category are the mood matrix oils (Serenity, Citrus Bliss, Elevation, and Balance) and all of the citrus oils. How can I help my children focus in school? There are two main areas that should be considered when helping children improve their ability to focus in a school setting. Perhaps most importantly, we must consider the consequences of good and bad nutrition. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is an instrumental factor in improving a child's performance in school that is often underplayed. I recommend taking advantage of the nutritional supplement products offered by dTERRA. The a2z chewable and IQ Mega are supplements specifically designed for use by children and are formulated to be excellent supplements to an overall healthy diet. In addition, I would also suggest developing a routine of essential oil use for your child. Many essential oils can be used to improve focus and increase clarity. InTune, Peppermint, and Citrus Bliss are remarkable choices that have been clinically demonstrated to help improve focus and increase retention of information. Diffusing essential oils during study time is a great way to help your child achieve and maintain optimal focus. What are the benefits of learning and using the AromaTouch\u00ae Technique? The main benefit of the AromaTouch technique is that, regardless of the circumstance, it becomes applicable and adaptive to the needs of the individual. Among the greatest strengths of the technique is that it confers overall health resil - iency to the recipient. In turn, our bodies are better equipped to react appropriately to a variety of different circumstances. In addition to overall health support, the AromaTouch Technique helps increase consistency of health, reduce stress, and improve and stabilize the immune system. The ease and simplicity with which the technique is performed eliminates any barriers to learning. I know that every person can learn the technique and properly perform it on others to achieve expected health outcomes. What is your favorite way to use essential oils? Through my own personal use of essential oils, I find that I categorize my use to best meet my needs. When experiencing discomfort in a specific area of my body, I use essential oils topically to ease and sooth the muscles and joints. I also love the aroma! Diffusing oils has a powerful effect on my emotions. It is elevating to the mood, calming, stabilizing, and helps give me a different perspec - tive. I also recognize the benefits of getting a consistent internal dose of essential oils. I use oils internally on a daily basis. DDR Prime and citrus oils are a mainstay on my internal usage regimen and I certainly notice times when I do not use them consistently. Although I do not necessarily have a consistent use model, I factor in each respective model of use for very specific purposes. For daily maintenance, I tend to use oils internally; for managing environment, I prefer the diffusion model; and for episodic issues, I tend to use oils topically.

It was first coined by anthelme Brillat-Savarin in an essay about the physiology of gout. In 1826, he wrote: \"Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are.\" Fast forward 187 years, and we have a shorter, slightly more american version. When this phrase was coined the world was a very different place. Life was simpler, including our food. Food was not labeled with the names of chemicals that required a degree in chemistry to understand. Today it seems more appropriate to say: \"If you are what you eat and you don't know what you're eating, do you know who you are?\" It is an eloquent and thought-provoking idea taken from French sociologist Claude Fischler. If we take this idea to heart, then looking back, I spent much of my twenties very confused. I rushed from class to class, ate on the go, and rarely cooked at home. What was I eating? What was I doing or not doing to my body? I had not yet realized that to be fit and healthy, you need to eat good, real food. Thankfully, my concept of health has dramatically changed over the last several years. Uncovering the path to true wellness has been an exciting and eye opening journey. My husband and I spent a lot of time reading and educating ourselves about various herbs, gardening, eating organic, and using essential oils. We experimented with recipes and canning. (His homemade salsa is my favorite.) Now, after many years of learning, we personally cherish the ability to plant a huge garden, make our own herbal extracts, buy exclusively organic foods, and use essential oils daily. MY INTRODUcTION TO dTERR a About a year ago, my dear friend Sharon, who knows I am a bit of a health nut, began telling me about dTERRA es- sential oils. What a blessing this has been for my family! I feel essential oils are the last piece of our wellness puzzle. They've become part of our everyday lives. Essential oils, being so potent, diverse, and safe, allow us to achieve the highest level of wellness. This fall is a wonderful time to examine your family's eating habits and incorpo-rate dTERRA products. Whether you are preparing school lunches or resolving to take your own lunch, may I make a few family-friendly suggestions? DON'T F ORGET aBOUT FRUITS aND VEGGIES Try eating a rainbow of food every day to get the entire spectrum of antioxidants your body needs. It's fun to have the kids build a rainbow platter out of brightly colored, sliced fruits and veggies. Remember, at least eight servings of fruits and vegetables per day, but more is better. Shakes are also a great way to add in (or hide) other supple- ments, oils, probiotics, herbs, and vitamins. Our whole family enjoys the Slim & Sassy TrimShake in the morning.

ExpERIMENT WITH ESSENTIaL OILS IN THE kIT cHEN My family loves organic steel cut oats flavored with almond milk, nuts, and 1-2 drops of Cinnamon or On Guard essential oil. Another tasty snack is sliced organic apples soaked for several hours in water with several drops of On Guard. The possibilities are endless. EDUca TE YOURSELF Start by learning to read food labels and become familiar with the chemical addi-tives, such as artificial colors and flavors, commonly added to foods. We can't simply add healthy foods; we must also clean up our diets by removing some of the chemicals that don't belong. There are many great resources you can use to gain better education on essential oils and nutrition. I wish you a happy, healthy, fun-filled journey as you seek your highest level of wellness.

I had never taken vitamins or supplements. I had never even paid attention to how my body reacted to the things I put into it. For instance, when I felt sick or tired, I just assumed it was because I was sick or tired. My son, Talon James, provided the motivation that I needed. I wanted to teach my son how to throw a ball and ride a bike, but I could not even make it up a flight of stairs without breathing heavily. I realized that my current condition was unacceptable and it was time to make some significant lifestyle changes. I thought of my son whenever I had a desire to cheat. Imagining him and me playing ball together pushed me through many grueling workouts. He is my world now.

Within one year, I was up 40 pounds. From 2002 to 2013, I gained an additional 50 pounds for a total of 270 pounds. I was overweight and my self-esteem was low, but I refused to change. I tried different diets and weight-loss programs, but I always cheated. I lacked the motiva-tion to create change in my life; I was comfortable. That all changed when Amber and I found out that we were expect - ing our first child. I refused to be the hypocritical dad who sat on the couch munching on fastfood while he told his son to stop playing video games and go play outside. \"The dTERR a\u00ae products enabled me to change my life.

I broke the button on my size 42-inch pants. The same clothes I had almost outgrown before my lifestyle change were baggy by the end of April. When I finally broke down and bought some new clothes, my new sizes stunned me. I fit into a large shirt and a 36-inch waist pant. I had not been able to wear these sizes for over 10 years and now they fit me perfectly. In addition to dropping two shirt sizes and three pant sizes, i lost a total of 57 pounds! Before the competition, i could hardly do any physical activity. When I attempted to run on the treadmill, I was barely able to break an 18-minute mile. To make matters worse, I pulled a muscle in my leg because I was trying to protect my bad knees. I turned to an athletic trainer for help. She evaluated me and made suggestions about how I could exercise while protecting vulnerable areas like my knees. In April, I ran four miles averaging less than 10 minutes per mile. I also started biking, swimming, and weight training. Last month, I ran my first triathlon and finished second in my age group. Running a triathlon has always been one of my dreams, but because of my weight I had never been in a position to do it. Now that I weigh a lot less, I can run, bike, and swim without hurting myself. These great changes have helped my self-esteem skyrocket. I no longer worry that people are going to judge me every time they see me. I have that old bounce in my step.

Hill Essential oils are volatile aromatic compounds that are fat soluble and liquid. With more than 3,000 compounds properly identified, the clinical efficacy of essential oils is well established. a number of studies have demonstrated the therapeutic properties of volatile aromatic compounds in a test tube, but how does this data correlate to the complex physiology of the human body? Investigating the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of volatile aromatics is the key to linking the data from test tube studies to real models of human use. There is adequate evidence suggesting that although essential oils are metabolized quickly, their distribution throughout the body is considered to be relatively high. Traditionally, there have been three acceptable models for essential oil usage: topical, oral, and aromatic. Previous research trials have demonstrated the value of topical and aromatic protocols. Due in part to the volatility of essential oils, aromatic exposure is by far the most effective. Aromatics are easily inhaled and then absorbed through the respiratory tract and lungs and then circulated through the blood stream. Topical application is also effective for initiating a response throughout the body because the fat soluble nature of essential oils allows them to easily penetrate the membranes of cells and be rapidly absorbed through the skin. Monoterpenoid compounds, just one of the many types of chemical constituents found in essential oils, are readily absorbed after topical application. The absorption of monoterpenoid compounds has been verified through analysis of blood concentrations of essential oil compounds. Maximum levels were achieved in as little as 10 minutes. The oral ingestion of essential oils is still under investigation. It is appropriate to assume that the effects of essential oils may be due to a single compound or the entire mixture of chemical components in the essential oil. How essential oils affect the body depends on their interaction with the bloodstream, hormones, and enzymes. Currently, human trials studying essential oil pathways are limited, but emerging science continues to support the use of volatile compounds internally. There is great interest in understanding more about the direct activity of essential oils in the human body, especially in regard to internal use. Current scientific research has identified several possible mechanisms of absorption and metabolism. Considering that data is only valuable if it uses correct methods and principles of human physiology, there are two key elements to determining the effectiveness of oral administration. First, it is important to understand the pathways by which essential oils are absorbed. Second, it is important to develop a specialized delivery system to maximize absorption of essential oils throughout the entire body. Most studies suggest that essential oil compounds are easily absorbed and that only a small portion of the essential oil remains unchanged. This means that much of the essential oil is metabo - lized regardless of the method of application. After being properly metabolized, essential oil compounds are eliminated through the kidneys or other drug metabolism pathways. Another interesting aspect of essential oil metabolism is that the compounds in the oil are not metabolized in identical ways. Take thymol for example, (an aromatic compound present in many different essential oils). One study showed that when used www.doterra.com / 11 REFERENCES Kohlert, C., et al., Systemic availability and pharmacokinetics of thymol in humans. J Clin Pharmacol. 2002 Jul;42(7):731-7.

This quick absorption suggests that thymol was absorbed through the small intestine, the uppermost absorptive organ of the digestive tract. What appears to be most relevant in essential oil application methods is the consistency with which essential oil compounds are delivered and are usable to target organs and cells. It is reasonable to suggest that current research has shown both aromatic and topical applications are beneficial and effective. With respect to oral use, the potential of essential oils to have therapeutic benefits throughout the body depends on dosage, chemical structure, and other variables. This does not, however, suggest that internal use is unsubstantiated. Sufficient studies and other models of personal and clinical reference support this type of usage. New medical technology is designed to optimize systemic delivery of fat soluble compounds. Fats are poorly soluble because they are not easily absorbed through watery layers such as those found in the intestinal tract. Self-emulsifying technology allows fat soluble molecules to become emulsified, or dispersed into a watery substance. In the intestinal tract, this technology allows fat soluble components to be delivered through the intestinal wall. This is a specialized delivery system that allows for isolated molecules to be delivered throughout the body. dTERRA uses this technology in its xEO Mega and DDR Prime softgels. I believe that future study will illustrate more methods of use to achieve the full benefit of the medicinal qualities of essential oils. While there is much yet to understand, I maintain a perspective of belief and appreciation for what has been a well-founded and historically relevant review of essential oil usage. www.doterra.com / 1112 / FALL 2013 living mA gAzine EssEntial Oil spOtlight InTune Staying focused in a world full of distractions can sometimes be a challenge.

Everything I'd heard about the people who live there gave me a desire to go and see it all for myself. Maybe that's why when I read an article in the newspaper about Care for Life, I couldn't get it out of my head. Care for Life is a nonprofit organization based out of Arizona that helps rebuild in the war-torn country of Mozambique. After months of putting it off for whatever reason, I finally committed to joining them this summer. 16-year civil war left the southeastern African country of Mozambique one of the poorest in the world. The founders of Care for Life have sought to help the people of Mozambique by teaching them how they can help themselves. Care for Life goes from village to village, teaching local leaders how to improve health care, quality of life, and self- reliance. The difference they have made so far has been dramatic. MY PROJECT I traveled to Mozambique with Care for Life as a volunteer journalist. I spoke directly with the people in the villages about how Care for Life has helped them. The most common thing I was told is that because of Care for Life, the people in the village now know how to take care of each other. They don't just focus on themselves anymore. They are concerned about their neighbors and they have the resources and knowl - edge to help. That is what it's all about\u2014caring for each other. We're all neighbors. We all need each other. If we have the knowledge and the resources to make someone else's life easier, then why don't we? I flew across the world to discover that no matter where we are, the secret to a prosperous life is helping each other. That's how these people's lives improved. The same goes for all of us. While in Mozambique, I visited several orphan- ages and played with many wonderful, loving children. I helped a widow build a latrine by her house. I helped teach children how to sew their own backpacks to carry their schoolwork. Best of all, I interacted with happy, incredible, strong people who have been through so much more than I am likely to ever experience. These people face so many obsta - cles in their lives for no reason other than where they happened to be born, and yet they take on every day with big, bright smiles. A LIFE -CHANGING EXPERIENCE I would like to be able to say I made a big difference in Mozambique. I would like to be able to say I contributed so much to these people's lives but, in reality, they gave me so much more than I gave them. The perspective I gained from the simplicity and happiness in which they live their lives taught me so much about my own life. That's why I'm addicted now. That's why I would like to make trips like this again and again for the rest of my life, because it filled my soul to meet these people. And that's why it's so important for us to serve people. We need it as much as they do. Learn more at www.careforlife.org.

When we are socially responsible, we are part of the solution. We relate to individuals in need and effect radical change. We provide justice for those who have no voice or no way out of their circumstances. We become a part of something bigger. Our small acts of service have a lasting impact, and there's joy to be found in that. For the last four years, dTERRA essential oils have been a big part of my life. After several amazing experiences, I wanted to share the oils not only with those who could afford them, but also with those who could not. I knew others, just like me, who wanted to find a way to share essential oils with those in need. My hope was to bring us together. I knew collectively we could make a bigger difference and that our efforts would inspire others to help. The giving of one's time, resources, networking abilities, funds, and support causes a ripple effect. A group effort accelerates goals and creates unity. We are always more powerful together than we are alone. What we choose to do, big or small, inspires others to make a positive change. Our gifts, talents, and abilities should not be bottled up and kept on a shelf, but used. GETTING INvo LvEd w ITh oT hERS During this journey, my husband Paul and I became connected with individuals creating access to clean water in Africa, running full-capacity orphanages in Haiti, and stopping cholera outbreaks in Sierra Leone. On these trips, we were able to utilize essential oils successfully and many beautiful, life-changing stories emerged. People wanted to give essential oils to those in need but didn't have the means to provide them to a whole village. We held events and trainings where we would ask people to donate an essential oil. Many times after an event, I would open up the donation box and be overwhelmed with emotion. Some people gave essential oils that they could only earn through a 200 PV promotion. It was amazing to see their generosity. In addition, dTERRA matched all product donations. It was so much more than we could have given on our own. We were able to get more specific about our needs through our Facebook page. There we linked those who had donated product with those who had received it. Those who receive products are able to share pictures, stories, and events. When others hear about the impact a few bottles of essential oils makes, they know the old saying \"It is better to give than to receive\" is true. There are local projects in the works and many people are yearning to help. I know that Give Oils has a bright future because of the type of people that the dTERRA culture attracts\u2014givers. My INSPIRATI oN When I was 13, I went on a mission trip to Thailand. As a teenager, I didn't think I had much to offer. I soon realized that I was making a significant difference just by giving my time. It was a truly rewarding experience. I realized that whether we are in need or not we are all human, and we all need help. I learned that sometimes those whom I was \"serving\" had more to offer me than I had to offer them. They taught me many valuable life lessons. I continued to do mission trips every summer until I graduated. I served in other countries like India and Vietnam, and other places throughout the Middle East. Those trips inspired me and opened my eyes to the opportunities to serve around the world.

Our CPTG Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade\u00ae quality standard requires precise care and effort to protect what nature has created so beautifully. This commitment to quality correlates directly to the life-enhancing benefits we have come to expect from dTERRA essential oils. Where the oil is sourced is essential. The composition of the plant will vary greatly based on the location, climate, and environment. After performing a series of tests, dTERRA discovered that where the plant is grown is a primary factor in determining the therapeutic quality of the essential oil. That's what makes dTERRA stand out. dTERRA has carefully selected farmers who have mastered their art in locations where plants have been grown traditionally for many years. potenC y Be Gins WitH tHe seeD dTERRA understands that potency begins with the seed. The proper seed variety (species) and even chemotype for particular plants must be carefully selected so that the distinct molecular profile of the aromatic compounds produced by the plant can be achieved. For example, there are many different plant varieties and chemotypes for rosemary. The chemotype depicts the level of particular compounds within the oil composition which will determine specific health benefits. dTERRA chose to offer Rosmarinus officinalis chemotype 1,8 cineol because we appreciate the benefits this specific composition offers for respiratory support as well as mental clarity. It's important that you know your plants and what types of benefits they offer. HArvestinG tHe riGHt pArt oF tHe pLAnt The environment plays a key role in the potency or therapeutic value of the plant. Growing season, elevation, climate, moisture, soil, terrain, and pH all factor into the quality or potency of the essential oil produced. It is also essential that the right part of the plant be harvested. The aromatic compounds from the leaves of the plant will differ from what is produced in the flowers. For example, we only use the yellow flowering tops of the Helichrysum italicum plant wild-crafted from Corsica for the most dependable therapeutic benefits, but many producers will harvest the leaves and stalks as well to increase the oil yield of this delicate crop thereby increasing their profitability. This completely changes the composition of the essential oil. WHere essentiAL oiLs Are sourCeD MA tters dTERRA has made the commitment to source our essential oils from artisans who grow aromatic crops in the indigenous soils of their land and follow our stringent growing and harvesting quality standards. This allows dTERRA to not only offer the world's finest essential oils, but to also impact the economy in a positive way on a global scale. Isn't it wonderful to know that the bottle of essential oil you are using today is not only benefiting you but also the person who so carefully grew it for your benefit? Plants grown in traditional or indigenous environments yield better results because the natural elements specific to that region promote a more therapeutic profile of the aromatic compounds produced by the plant. For example, dTERRA's Lavender EMIL y WRIGHT Vice President, Leadership Development THE ART of SELECTIng www.doterra.com / 21 THERAPEUTIC ESSEnTIAL OIL S (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil is indigenous to the Provence region of France. The high altitudes at which lavender is grown results in the plant having higher ester and sesquiterpene alcohol content, thereby increasing its therapeutic benefits. you simply cannot duplicate the rocky soil and Mediterrean growing conditions that are specific to this region anywhere else. Although lavender grows readily in the United States, the therapeutic values are not as beneficial because, the growing conditions that exist in the native lands cannot be duplicated. Where your oils are sourced matters. Another example is dTERRA Lemon (Citrus limon) essential oil, which is indigenous to Sicily. The rich soil conditions, the salty, humid air from the Mediterranean Sea and rocky, mountainous terrain all contribute toward the sweet lemons that have made this region so famous for its citrus production. There is a saying in Sicily that \"lemons aren't real unless they are Sicilian.\" Although lemon oil can be acquired from the US, Argentina, or other regions for a much lower price, dTERRA is committed to sourcing our oils from indigenous regions that produce the highest quality essential oils. It's not about price, it's about results!Producing essential oils that meet the dTERRA CPTG Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade\u00ae standard is a skill requiring years of experience. It takes the work of a dedicated artisan at each step, from growing and harvesting to fine-tuning the distillation process, dTERRA only partners with the best. ABout tHe A utHor: Emily's hands-on experience and understanding of global sourcing of oils and quality assurance practices has allowed dTERR a the ability to offer nature's purest essences, sourced from the most pristine regions around the globe. 22 / FALL 2013 living mA gAzine A a friend introduced me to dterra about six months ago. i was willing to test essential oils out because, like many of us, i suffer from health challenges from time to time. my family and i use l emon, lavender, and Peppermint essential oils individually and in a blend as part of our daily routine. t hese oils alleviate a variety of issues and improve our overall quality of life. Here are a few examples of how we use each of these oils. Lemon lemon oil can be used for cooking and cleaning and to improve health. it can also help soothe an irritated throat. last winter, i experienced some irritation in my throat. i gargled with l emon oil in the morning. After about five minutes, the irritation began to dissipate. i repeated the gargling, and by the end of the morning, the discomfort was gone and i was able to enjoy my daily activities. Aside from the pleasant smell and taste, lemon contains many beneficial properties and can be used for a variety of purposes. Lavender My family and i have become huge fans of lavender. This essential oil is wonderful for relieving occasional stress and promoting natural relaxation. lavender works especially well in supporting a healthy and natural sleep. We apply a couple drops to our feet before we turn in for the night. We are always amazed at how quickly we slip into a deep, comfortable sleep. PePPerminT Peppermint oil is versatile. One of my favorite ways to use Peppermint is to diffuse it. it creates a wonderful and purifying aroma. Applying a few drops of this soothing essential oil to the back of my neck is a great way to ease muscle tensions in the head and neck. i also use Peppermint oil for indigestion. When i feel discomfort coming on, i add two drops to eight ounces of water, and feel almost an immediate relief. Trio BLend Every spring, i experience seasonal discomfort. This year, i learned that the l emon-lavender-Peppermint trio can be used as a natural soothing agent. When i feel the need, i add two drops of each oil to eight ounces of water, and let the blend do its magic. i can honestly say this has been a fantastic year for me. i am very grateful to have safe alternative choices in my family's health care. i would encourage anyone to experience the amazing benefits of dTERRA. Todd JuLien's daily routine Beginners t rio Kit- item no. 32140001The dTERRA TRIO\u2014 a mus T havewww.doterra.com / 23 Lavender lavender was the first essential oil my family and i used. Every now and then, our daughter Abby has a hard time falling asleep. We apply lavender under her nose and on her neck to help her wind down before bedtime. My other daughter Brinley uses the oil for hangnails or occasional scratches she receives while playing. We knew right away that dTERRA essential oils would greatly benefit our family. Since then, we've been using lavender as part of our daily routine. PePPerminT Each of us uses Peppermint to relieve occasional upset stomach. Our oldest girls use Peppermint beadlets to help them breathe easier. The little ones do not appreciate the taste of Peppermint internally, but the rest of us love the beadlets for a breath freshener and a quick \"pick-me-up.\" Lemon in our home, we use l emon as a natural cleaning agent. My wife usually adds 10-15 drops of lemon to an eight-ounce glass spray bottle filled with water to use for cleaning and removing buildup in the kitchen and in the bathrooms. Pure l emon works well for cleaning up the sticky messes on carpets, clothes, and any other place our children decide to leave \"tracks.\" The oil fills our house with an uplifting and energizing aroma that everyone in the family enjoys. dave WhiTW orTh's daily routine Boost Your immune sY stem 3 drops Lemon 2 drops oregano 2 drops on Guard 2 drops Peppermint 2 drops clove 1 drop melaleuca tiPs: Use 1-2 drops of l emon to remove oil, gum, grease spots, or glue.editor's tiP: Use Veggie caps (item no. 34100001) for internal use of the oils. dTerra Lavender comes from high- altitude regions of France and is considered the best of the French fine lavenders. dTerra Lemon comes from cold- pressed premium italian lemons, and contains a wider concentration of active compounds than other varieties. dTerra Peppermint comes from peppermint plants grown and harvested in Washington state\u2014these plants contain a higher concentration of menthol than pepper- mint grown in other regions of the world. facTs 24 / FALL 2013 living mA gAzine diy kids room DiFFusinG essentiAL oiLs aT NIGHT : Lavender (Item No. 30110001) and Roman chamomile essential oils (Item No. 30800001) On Guard protective Blend (Item No. 31100001) Serenity c alming Blend (Item No. 31090001) Breathe Respiratory Blend (Item No. 31070001) IN THE MORNING: Lemon (Item No. 30120001) citrus Bliss (Item No. 31020001) Elevation (Item No. 31040001) Wild Orange (Item No. 30170001) Lotus Diffuser (Item No. 33010001) reWArD stiCkers TURN ESSENTIaL OIL LaBELS INTO REW aRD S TIckERS Ever wondered what to do with extra essential oil labels?
