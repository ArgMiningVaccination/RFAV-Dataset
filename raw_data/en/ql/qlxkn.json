The PSC exemplifies the tripartite mission of the College of Psychology (COP), where education, training, and research come together in the form of services offered to the community. Since 1984, the doctoral psychology internship program has been an integral component of the PSC. Interns provide psychological services to clients from the richly diverse South Florida area, under the supervision of expert faculty and psychologists, many of whom are nationally recognized for their groundbreaking research and development of state-of-the-art treatment programs. ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE The Internship program is sponsored by Nova Southeastern University, an independent, not-for- profit, fully accredited, institution of higher education. Nova Southeastern University (NSU) is located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. NSU is a private, not-for-profit research institution accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. NSU is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a research university with \"high research activity.\" NSU is one of only 50 universities nationwide to also be awarded Carnegie's Community Engagement Classification. NS U is also the largest private, not-for-profit institution in the United States that meets the U.S. Department of Education's criteria as a Hispanic -Serving Institution. For more than 50 years, NSU has been fostering groundbreaking research and a commitment to community. The university awards associate's, bachelor's, master's, specialist, doctoral, and first-professional degrees in a wide range of fields, including the humanities, biological and environmental science, business, counseling, computing and engi neering sciences, conflict resolution, education, family therapy, medicine, dentistry, various health professions, law, marine sciences, performing and visual arts, psychology, and other social sciences. NSU has campuses in Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Miami, Miramar, Orlando, Palm Beach, and Tampa, Florida, as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico, while also maintaining a global presence online. The institution also has an excellent reputation for its programs for families offered through the Mailma n Segal Center for Human Development and the NSU University School. These include innovative parenting, preschool, primary, and secondary education programs, as well as an internationally recognized, model program for children with autism spectrum disorder s. The Psychology Services Center (PSC) Internship program is housed within the College of Psychology (COP), a graduate center with programs in clinical psychology, school psychology, general psychology, mental health counseling, and school counseling. The Ph.D. and Psy.D. Programs in Clinical Psychology are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the American Psychological Association. Questions related to the programs' accredited status should be directed to the: Commission on Accreditation: Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation American Psychological Association, 750 1st Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20002, Phone: (202) 336-5979, Email apaaccred@apa.org, Web: www.apa.org/ed/accreditation. The COP maintains a tripartite mission of education and training in psychology, service to the community, and clinical research. The PSC carries out the COP mission by allowing for learning Rev. 08/2 2 Page 4 rooted in real problems and research activities that attempt to find answ ers to current issues and concerns. The center seeks to offer programs of excellence in educating fut ure mental health practitioners in advancing knowledge about psychological problems and their treatment, and in providing high-quality services that addres s society's mental health needs. PSYCHOLOGY SERVICES CENTER (PSC) Nova Southeastern University (NSU) Psychology Services Center (PSC) provides psychological services to over 1,500 clients per year. The PSC provides a broad array of outpatient services, including screening, referrals, an extensive biopsychosocial evaluation, and various modalities of psychotherapy in general and specialized programs. The PSC also offers psychological evaluations, as well as psychoeducational evaluations for school-related issues. The resulting confluence of training opportunities is unique in its offering: 1. NSU PSC treatment programs that are directed by licensed psychologists, most of whom are COP faculty members. 2. An outpatient clinical service facility that serves a large, diverse, and clinically rich population of child, adult, and older adult clients. Interns, postdoctoral residents, and practicum students complement the professional staff and become fully integrated into the staff of the center. Such integration enhances training through exposure to an array of professional viewpoints and provides opportunities for ongoing collaboration with Faculty psychologists. Interns become part of the treatment team in their program rotations and they regularly interact with other interns during the time they spend together attending seminars and group supervision. Interns have the opportunity to supervise practicum students under the supervision of licensed psychologists, and receive supervision from a post- doctoral resident under the supervision of the directors of the postdoctoral residency and internship programs, both of whom are licensed psychologists. INTERNSHIP PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The PSC internship training program is full-time for 12 months (2,000 hours). It has three major components: (1) supervised clinical experience in general adult and child service programs, (2) supervised clinical experience in faculty directed specialty clinics, and (3) training seminars, case staffing, and other structured training activities . Interns will receive experience in these areas based on a practitioner informed by science model, a principle component of which is using the psychology research knowledge base as a guide to inform direct service delivery. Interns will work within a training clinic in an academic center where opportunities to become involved in on-going research or to collaborate on original research is available to interested interns. A list of COP faculty and their areas of interest are available on the COP website: http://psychology.nova.edu/index.html The PSC internship program was awarded full APA accreditation in 1987. The PSC Internship Program is currently accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the American Psychological Rev. 08/2 2 Page 5 Association. Questions related to the program's accredited status should be dir ected to the Commission on Accreditation: Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation American Psychological Association 750 1st Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 336-5979 Email: apaaccred@apa.org Web: www.apa.org/ed/accreditation INTERNSHIP AIM AND COMPETENCIES The aim of the Psychology Services Center (PSC) internship training program is to provide broad and general preparation for entry-level independent practice and licensure as Health Service Psychologists. To this end, interns are provided with training based on a practitioner informed by science model, which adheres to the philosophy that good health service practice is based on an empirical foundation, coupled with an understanding of the individual and his/her broader context (i.e., biological, psychological, social, cultural, , etc.). The PSC internship training program expos es interns to an array of clinically and culturally diverse clients of all ages and a variety of intervention approaches, all scientifically-informed and tailored to meet the individual and cultural needs of clients. Each intern simultaneously provides services to clients within three separate programs throughout the year. Interns have the opportunity to work with clients across the lifespan including children, adolescents, adults, and older adults. Additionally, the members of the training faculty represent a broad spectrum of theoretical orientations including cognitive -behavioral, psychodynamic, and systems approaches. The program's faculty believe that health service psychology practice should be informed by science, and thus require interns to use the p sychology research knowledge base as a guide to assessment and treatment. Internship training includes supervised practice experience, supervision in evidence-based assessment and intervention methods, and opportunity for involvement in applied clinical research when available. Given the College of Psychology's mission combining education and training in psychology, service to the community, and clinical research , the administrators, supervisors and staff are highly invested in training future psychologists. Thus, the internship program emphasizes training and supervision above all other activities. To meet the aim of preparing interns for entry-level independent practice and licensure as Health Service Psychologists, interns are expected to develop profession-wide competencies as follows: I. Research Demonstrate the substantially independent ability to critically evaluate and disseminate research or other scholarly activities (e.g., case conference, presentation, publications) at the local (including the host institution), regional, or national level. II. Ethical and Legal Standards Rev. 08/2 2 Page 6 Demonstrate knowledge of, and act in accordance with, APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, relevant laws, regulations, rules, and policies governing health service psychology, and relevant professional standards and guidelines (including agency policies and procedures); recognize ethical dilemmas and apply ethical decision-making processes; conduct self in an ethical manner in all professional activities. III. Individual and Cultural Diversity Demonstrate an understanding of how own personal/cultural history may affect how one interacts with people different from themselves; evidence knowledge of the current theoretical and empirical knowledge base as it relates to diversity; demonstate the ability to integrate awareness and knowledge of individual and cultural differences in the conduct of professional roles; independently apply knowledge in working effectively with the range of diverse individuals and groups. IV. Professional Values, Attitudes and Behaviors Behave in ways that reflect the values and attitudes of psychology; engage in self-reflection; demonstrate openness and responsiveness to feedback and supervision; respond professionally in increasingly complex situations with a greater degree of independence. V. Communication and Interpersonal Skills Develop and maintain effective relationships with a wide range of individuals; produce and comprehend oral, nonverbal, and written communications; demonstrate effective interpersonal skills. VI. Assessment Select and apply assessment methods that draw from empirical literature; collect relevant data using multiple sources and methods; interpret assessment results to inform case conceptualization, classification, and recommendations; communicate findings in a n accurate and effective manner. VII. Intervention Establish and maintain effective relationships with the recipients of psychological services; develop evidence-based intervention plans; implement interventions informed by the current scientific literature; apply the relevant research literature to clinical decision making; modify and adapt evidence-based approaches; evaluate intervention effectiveness. VIII. Supervision Demonstrate knowledge of supervision models and practices; apply this knowledge in direct or simulated practice with psychology trainees, or other health professionals. IX. Consultation and Interprofessional/ Interdisciplinary Skills Demonstrate knowledge and respect for the roles and perspectives of other professions. SUPERVISED CLINICAL EXPERIENCE Interns devote at least 40 percent of their time to direct clinical service. Fourteen (14) hours per week of direct service are required for the first half of the year. This requirement increases to sixteen (16) hours per week of direct service for the second half. Interns are responsible for documenting their Rev. 08/2 2 Page 7 direct and indirect services monthly by completing the Intern Activity Log (Appendix A), obtaining their primary supervisor's signature, and submitting the log to the D irector of Internship Training monthly. Provision of supervision to practicum students can be counted as direct service up to three hours per week, with no more than one and a half hours from any one clinic program. In order to provide exposure to a broad range of clinical experiences and modalities, all interns are required to gain experience in the following areas: 1. Intervention: Interns are assigned a diverse client case load and work in a variety of modalities (e.g., individual, marital, family, and group therapy, etc.). Cases are representative of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnic/racial and gender identities, sexual orientations, religions, disabilities, and presenting problems. During individual and group supervision and weekly seminars, interns are exposed to a broad base of knowledge and skills including a variety of intervention models and techniques, service delivery approaches, and culturally competent interventions. 2. Assessment: Interns generally complete at least one biopsychosocial (BPS) evaluation per month to provide a means of refining diagnostic and treatment planning skills. Interns complete a minimum of six (6) psychological evaluations during the year under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Interns completing the SPACI rotation are required to complete a minimum of ten (10) evaluations per year because this specialty program is focused primarily on assessment. Interns will document each completed evaluation by entering the date of the evaluation and obtaining their supervisor's signature of the Internship Testing Summary form (Appendix J). There are opportunities for consultation with multiple supervisors regarding assessment and report writing and exposure to a broad range of assessment instruments and report writing skills from weekly seminars. 3. Consultation/Education: Interns participate in supervised consultation activities with other professionals. Interns are required to provide consultation and/or in-service presentations on a minimum of 4 diversity topics during the training year, and keep track of these using the Diversity Projects Log (Appendix K). Interns also serve as instructors for a doctoral pre- practicum/interviewing lab course during the W inter semester (January - April). 4. Supervision: Interns provide group supervision to ASP practicum students, under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. Additional opportunities for providing doctoral students with individual supervision and/or mentoring for Clinical Competency Examinations (CCE) may also be available. 5. Research: Interns participate in program evaluation didactics and a Logic Model group project to enhance their knowledge and skills in this area (see Appendix B). Interns must include a critical review of the research literature in their inte rn presentations (see Appendix F). Supervision includes discussions about the empirical support for an array of assessment and intervention approaches used with clients and interns will be exposed to a broad array of clinical/scientific knowledge during weekly training activities (e.g., PD, Grand Rounds and intern presentations). Rev. 08/2 2 Page 8 Each intern receives three hours of individual supervision per week from their licensed psychologist supervisors: one hour from each general program supervisor and one hour from the specialty program supervisor. Supervision may include the use of direct, live observation, video recordings, case notes, and other supporting materials. Supervisors provide formative feedback based on their observations of interns' provision of direct services (e.g. intervention, assessment, or consultation) no less frequently than quarterly. Additionally, interns receive one hour per week of group supervision with the Director of Internship Training, who is a licensed psychologist, and one hour of biweekly group supervision with a postdoctoral resident under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. The interns also participate in weekly case conferences within the various service programs. Interns are responsible for completing the Monthly Supervision Attendance Record (Appendix C), obtaining their primary supervisor's signature on this form, and submitting it to the Director of Internship Training each month, no later than the first Friday of the following month. Supervisors are responsible for providing interns with written feedback quarterly regarding their performance and progress toward meeting competency requirements (see Appendices D & E). Informal verbal feedback is provided on an ongoing basis. Rotation s Interns match to one of four specialty service programs, and simultaneously complete both the specialty service program rotation and two general program rotations throughout the course of the year. Approximately 50% of an intern's case load will come from the specialty service program and the remaining 50% will come from the general services programs (approximately 25% from CAFS and 25% from ASP). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the clinic has transitioned to providing services via Telehealth, and is also operating at partial capacity and in accordance with CDC and Health Department guidelines for in-person services. Interns will have the option to come to the clinic in person, but, as of September 1, 2020, are not required to do so. This policy will be reevaluated periodically according to CDC and Health Department information. General Programs (required; 25% of case assignments from each of the following): 1. Child , Adolescent and Family Services (CAFS) Program providers are committed to working together with children, adolescents, and their families toward the goal of improving their quality of life. Services include individual, group, and play therapy, as well as psychological assessment and parenting skills training. A comprehensive diagnostic and treatment approach is used to assist families with children ages 4 through 17 with varying emotional, cognitive, and/or behavioral difficulties such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, school and behavioral problems, childhood bedwetting and incontinence, and other mental health issues facing children and adolescents Coordinator and Supervisor: Yukari Tomozawa, Psy.D. Typically, a systemic approach to conceptualization is most common f or the issues seen in CAFS ; therefore, multiple services are offered for families (e.g. individual and family therapy) with a team approach to treatment. Interns will typically have a caseload of 5 -6 clients for this rotation. Each intern will be assigned two testing batteries that can involve psychoeducational Rev. 08/2 2 Page 9 and/or social -emotional testing. Biweekly case conferences are held , for two hours, for the purpose of didactic presentation or case discussion. Interns provide clinical or conceptualization feedback for the practicum students as part of the case conference. Weekly one hour supervision is held with the CAFS coordinator /supervisor. 2. Adult Services Program (ASP) works with individuals motivated to improve their level of functioning and mental health well-being. Services available include individual and group psychotherapy as well as psychological assessments as they relate to treatment recommendations. A comprehensive biopsychosocial diagnostic and treatment approach is used to help adults 18 and older with a wide variety of psychological problems/difficulties including: anxiety, social skills problems, depression, stress, severe and persistent mental illness, and other mental health issues . Coordinator and Supervisor: Leonard Schnur, Psy. D., ABPP Additional training opportunities with ASP include participation in a Group Psychotherapy Training Module where each intern may observe and potentially co-lead a 90 minute group which is process-oriented. The group meets each Monday evening from 7 -8:30pm with discussion prior to and following group. The group is observed weekly by the ASP training supervisor along with several ASP practicum trainees. The group is also videotaped for ongoing supervision and instructional purposes. Each intern, as part of their ASP rotation, also facilitates a small group supervision comprised of 3-4 ASP practicum trainees. The supervision group is required to meet weekly for a 90-minute period where both intern and trainees discuss ongoing psychotherapy cases and are invited to schedule clients for observation. Throughout the year, interns become more familiar with their developing role as a supervisor and become more comfortable with the guidance offered to their trainees. The small group supervision process also a ssists trainees in professional development and serves as a mentoring program for our ASP trainees. Specialty Program Options (50% of case assignments from one of the following): 1. Child and Adolescent Traumatic Stress Program (CATSP) serves children to age 17 years who are experiencing psychological, somatic, and behavioral problems in reaction to trauma, bereavement, and/or traumatic bereavement. Director and Supervisor: Christopher M. Layne, Ph.D. Andrea Loeb, Psy.D, P.A. Clinical Supervisor and Adjunct Faculty In CATSP, interns will have opportunities to provide individual therapy, family therapy, and parent training; be trained in a variety of theoretical orientations, including cognitive Rev. 08/2 2 Page 10 behavioral theory, developmental psychopathology, developmental trauma theory, multidimensional grief theory, and conservation of resources theory ; be trained in manualized interventions focusing on traumatic stress and bereavement; build professional skills in the areas of trauma-informed/bereavement-informed (as cases necessitate) evidence-based assessment using a variety of tools, including measures of trauma exposure/PTSD and bereavement/Prolonged Grief Disorder; build professional skills in the areas of trauma- informed/bereavement-informed (as cases necessitate) evidence -based practice including reviewing the literature, case conceptualization, treatment planning, and professional judgment/critical reasoning (including tools from the NCTSN Core Curriculum on Childhood Trauma); engage in community-based outreach, professional networking, and collaboration with professionals from other agencies; participate in a variety of applied clinical research projects within the CATSP program (and Dr. Layne's Traumatic Stress and Berea vement Research Lab); and provide group training/supervision to current CATSP doctoral practicum students on selected topics. 2. Trauma Resolution Integration Program (TRIP) is dedicated to helping adults (18 or older) who have experienced trauma\u2014such as childhood abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual), criminal assault, rape, life threatening accidents, or natural disasters (hurricanes, floods), or political torture\u2014to overcome the variety of difficulties that often occur as the result of the trauma. Director and Supervisor: Amy Ellis, Ph.D. The Trauma Resolution & Integration Program (TRIP) trains interns in the assessment and treatment of trauma-related psychological difficulties. TRIP treats clients age 18 and up with all forms of traumatic exposure (e.g. child abuse, domestic violence, criminal assaults, life - threatening accidents, combat/military trauma) and with dissociative difficulties. Interns carry an individual therapy caseload of 8 to 10 clients a week and co -lead a dialectical behavior therapy group. TRIP provides interns with 3 hours per week of group supervision and 1 hour per week individual supervision. Group supervision includes staffing of cases, didactic coverage of the knowledge and skills needed to effectively t reat survivors of psychological trauma and to conduct dialectical behavior therapy groups, and case presentations. Individual supervision consists primarily of coverage of the intern's individual therapy caseload. Interns also provide weekly group supervision to TRIP practicum students. 3. NSU Counseling Center for Older Adults (NCCOA) serves adults ages 55 years and older who are interested in developing more effective ways of managing the difficult situations and challenges that can occur in life. The overarching goal of the NCCOA program is to help the clients age as well as possible, which includes maximizing their quality of life and level of functioning. Director and Supervisor: Ashley Stripling, Ph.D. Rev. 08/2 2 Page 11 The overarching goal of NCCOA rotation is to prepare the intern to work as a competent member of the health care team. The Director holds joint clinical faculty appointments in the NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine's Geriatric Medicine Department and NSU Psychology Services Center/College of Psychology, and has developed many enriching clinical activities for an intern to build proficiency in geropsychology. In July 2012, the NSU Doctoral Clinical Psychology Program in the College of Psychology (COP) was granted membership in the Council of Professional Geropsychology Training Programs (CoPGTP). This membership is formal recognition that the NSU Program meets the gold standard Pikes Peak training model in geropsychology (see the CoPGTP website for more detail: http://www.copgtp.org/). Interns will have opportunities to work with older adults in individual and group therapy, to conduct psychological and targeted cognitive assessment, to consult with geriatricians in the geriatric medicine clinic, and to work as a member of several interdisciplinary healthcare teams (e.g., Fall Preventi on Team Clinic, Aphasia Caregiver Support Group, Parkinsons Support Group). Also, interns will be given opportunities to develop supervision skills by leading a monthly case conference and peer - supervising the clinical work of doctoral practicum students. NSU also has a Geriatric Education Center (GREAT GEC; http://nova.edu/gec/), of which the NCCOA Director is a member. The GEC has ongoing educational and intraprofessional collaborative activities throughout the year in which the intern may participate, in cluding the annual GEC Symposium and weekly Intraprofessional Geriatric Journal Club. 4. School-related Psychological Assessments and Clinical Interventions (SPACI) clinic offers comprehensive psychological/psychoeducational evaluations and evidence -based as well as innovative interventions for school-related academic, developmental, behavioral, emotional, and learning problems. These evaluations and interventions include, but are not limited to, adult, parent, and child interviews; behavioral observations; f ormal test administration; psychological/psychoeducational reports; personal feedback to clients and parents of minors; school consultation as appropriate; and counseling/psychotherapy as well as academic assistance as needed. Director and Supervisor: Shannon Worton, PsyD Supervisor: Nicole Jimenez, PsyD Interns completing the SPACI rotation will receive training in both school -related and clinical service delivery. Interns will be required to demonstrate their assessment, problem- solving, and intervention skills by conducting thorough developmental and psychosocial histories with parents or adult clients ; accessing available school and community records to determine appropriate assessment measures and strategies to be used with a particular case; conducting observations in schools or other locations as appropriate; administering, scoring, and interpreting traditional assessment measures ; utilizing functional and curriculum-based assessment techniques as appropriate; and designing innovative data collection methods as needed to address both referral questions and difficulties discovered during the evaluation process. Interns are also required to integrate assessment data by collaborating with and receiving assistance from the carefully selected supervisory aides and to generate comprehensive written reports. Interns will provide targeted, intervention services guided by Rev. 08/2 2 Page 12 assessment results and ongoing data-based decision making. In addition to school-based referrals, interns will also provide individual, family, and group psychotherapy. SPACI also offers interns participation in supervision, using the Collaborative Hierarchical Intensive Programmatic Supervision (CHIPS) model, wherein specialist students, doctoral students, interns, and post-doctoral psychology residents provide direct supervision to trainees commensurate with their levels of training and experience. Additionally, SPACI interns will attend the regularly-scheduled, program-specific didactics, Enhancement of Intensive Evaluation, Interviewing, and Observation Skills (EIEIOS), offered to all trainees in the program. PROGRAM -WIDE TRAINING AND SEMINARS In addition to weekly individual supervision, interns are given the opportunity to continue to develop a theoretical framework to support their direct clinical experience through the following additional training activities : \u00a8 Group Supervision (1 hour weekly with Director of Internship Training; 1 hour biweekly with postdoctoral resident Interns meet with the Director of Internship Training, a licensed psychologist, weekly for group supervision focused on case discussions and supervision of supervision provided to practicum students, enhancing self-reflection and self-care, negotiating conflict, and professional development, including postdoctoral training and licensure. The interns also utilize this time to discuss their experience of the program and their in dividual progress, and evaluate how successfully the program is addressing their needs. In addition, it provides interns access to the Director of Internship Training. Interns are also assigned to an NSU postdoctoral resident at the outset of the traini ng year and meet with their assigned resident biweekly or more frequently if schedules permit. While postdoctoral residents are not licensed, they provide the interns with additional mentoring and exposure to alternative supervisory styles. \u00a8 Program Meetings (3-5 hours/week ) Interns attend program meetings in each of their rotations. Activities include case conference/staffing, clinical discussion, specialized didactics, and group supervision. Training in a breadth of clinical issues and ethical and legal professional standards is incorporated into supervision and seminars to further prepare interns for generalist practice and the highest standards of professional conduct. Interns spend 2-3 hours per week in one of three types of weekly seminar training activities that all interns are required to participate in (see Appendix D for the Schedule of Training Seminars and Activities ): \u00a8 Professional Development Seminars/Continuing Education Workshops (3 hours) Interns attend a series of formal didactic seminars at Nova Southeastern University (NSU) conducted by NSU faculty, community clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, or other guest presenters. The Professional Development series covers b road areas including: ethics and professional behavior, assessment approaches, psychopathology and treatment interventions for Rev. 08/2 2 Page 13 adults and youth, cultural & individual differences, psychopharmacology, and professional development. A number of these seminars include workshops sponsored by NSU COP's Continuing Education program, exposing interns to a broad base of psychology knowledge and skills from nationally and internationally renowned presenters. \u00a8 Grand Rounds (2 hours) Interns attend presentations and case discussions at local hospitals, agencies, and other community organizations affiliated with NSU approximately once a month. \u00a8 Intern Presentations (2 - 3 hours) Interns facilitate didactic presentations on a variety of topics of clinical interest developed from reviews of the research literature. Interns are provided with feedback about their presentation skills and ability to critically discuss the literature supporting their presentation using the Intern Presentation Ratings form (see Appendix E) and a summary of their fellow intern's ratings of their presentation using the Professional Development Evaluation Survey (see Appendix F). These ratings are also shared with the interns' supervisors. Attendance at all weekly training activities is mandatory. Each intern is responsible for signing the attendance sheet for these trainings as records of attendance/absence are kept on file. Interns may be excused from two seminars per quarter for illness or w ith advanced approval from the Director of Internship Training. If more than 2 training activities are missed in any quarter, the intern must make up the absence by one of the following means: (a) presenting an additional didactic to fellow interns or (b) providing proper documentation of attend ance at an outside workshop relevant to professional psychology during the same quarter. If four (4) or more training activities within the same quarter are missed, the intern must present an additional didactic to make up for the excessive absence and the intern's poor attendance will be reflected on that quarter's performance evaluation. No more than eight (8) missed training activities per year will be acceptable unless under very serious circumstances. Please note that making up missed didactics by attending outside presentations is considered to make up for missed learning, but does not excuse interns from the maximum absences listed above. Intern feedback is crucial to ensuring the quality of training activities. Interns are asked to complete Professional Development Evaluation Survey (see Appendix F) forms after each Professional and intern didactic presentation. This information is used to make improvements to training activities yearly. It is also used to provide formative feedback to fellow interns regarding their professional presentation skills as detailed in the section above. At mid -year and again at the end of the training year, interns are asked to provide feedback about the training program (see Appendix G) and supervisor performance (see Appendix H). The Director of Internship Training summarizes this information as group data and presents it to the supervisors during training committee meetings. Care is taken to protect the anonymity of the interns providing the feedback. The aim of sharing this information with supervisors is twofold: first, to increase awareness of program strengths and areas in need of improvement and second, to inform the development of plans to improve the quality of the training program. RESOURCES Rev. 08/2 2 Page 14 Interns share offices equipped with a desk, computer, and phone for each intern. Clients are seen in the PSC clinic rooms, which are scheduled following the PSC room scheduling procedures . Interns receive administrative support from the PSC front office staff and the internship program Graduate Assistant, as well as technical support from the center and university Help Desk (954) 262 -HELP (4357) 1-800-541-6682, ext. 24357 help@nova.edu. Interns also have access to all of the COP and University resources which include a fully stocked psychological testing library on the second floor of the Maltz Psychology Building, internship program test holdings, and additional specialized psychological tests within various PSC clinic programs . Moreover, interns may access campus-wide computer labs, and state-of-the art University libraries: http://www.nova.edu/community/libraries.html, including the extensive full-text electronic journal holdings at the Alvin Sherman Library http://www.nova.edu/library/main/.

All interns who display competency in all areas of the final Intern Competency Evaluation (Appendix C) and completed the required 2000 hours will be deemed as attaining the program's aim of readiness fo r entry level independent practice and licensure as a Health Service Psychologist. INTERN RECORDS Rev. 08/2 2 Page 15 All Intern training records are stored in locked file cabinets. The records for the more recent training years are stored within the internship training director's office or the cubicle designated for use by the Internship Graduate Assistant(s). Older records are stored within locked file cabinets within locked COP file rooms. Any formal complaints would be maintained within the intern's file, and kept on record in the Office of the Dean of the College of Psychology. Rev. 08/2 2 Page 16 INTERN EVALUATION Interns are evaluated three times per year by their primary supervisor within each rotation. Interns are evaluated using the Intern Competency Evaluation form (see Appendix C) at 3 months, 8 months, and 12 months. Following a developmental model, all ratings are made relative to the level of performance expected given the point of the year at which the evaluation is conducted. Specifically, at the 3-month evaluation, interns are expected to demonstrate minimal to basic knowledge, skills, and abilities (corresponding to ratings within the range of \"minimal knowledge, skills, and abilities\" or \"basic knowledge, skills, and abilities\"). The standards are raised as the intern progresses toward completion of the internship year. At the 8 -month evaluation, each intern must receive a rating of \"2 - basic knowledge, skills, and abilities\" or higher (e.g., 3 - intermediate knowledge, skills, and abilities or 4 - advanced knowledge, skills, and abilities) in all competency areas. Any rating of \"1- minimal knowledge, skills, and abilities\" will require the generation of a performance improvement plan (See Appendix K) to assist the intern in improving the particular area of competency. At 12 months, during the final evaluation, each intern is required to receive minimum ratings of \"3 - intermediate knowledge, skills\" and abilities\" or higher (i.e., \"4 - advanced knowledge, skills, and abilities\") in all areas assessed in order to successfully complete the internship. At the end of the training year, all interns who display competency in all areas will be deemed as having attained the program's aim of readiness for entry level independent practice and licensure as a Health Service P sychologist. Due Process and Grievance It is the policy of the PSC Internship that interns are assured due process regarding concerns that might arise over their performance and functioning. The policy is guided by principles to ensure that interns receive ongoing constructive feedback about their performance, opportunities and support for remediation if needed, as well as advisement of intern rights and responsibilities and processes to address concerns or grievances. This policy is enacted with respect for intern diversity in areas of professional functioning; therefore, PSC supervisors are expected to adapt the supervisory style, focus, and expectations for each intern based on the intern's professional developmental level, theoretical orientation, personality and cultural background. The PSC Intern Performance Agreement (see Appendix L) is developed with the interns at the outset of traini ng, establishing the expectations for the intern, as well as the methods by which the internship goals and objectives will be met. The agreement forms the basis for evaluation of the intern's performance throughout the year. Intern Performance Interns are evaluated and provided with both formative and summative feedback on an ongoing basis through weekly individual supervision and formal quarterly performance evaluations. If at any time there are deficiencies in an intern's performance or professionali sm, the intern's supervisor will provide constructive verbal feedback to the intern and document in writing any discussions related to the problem area(s). While it is difficult to operationally define all characteristics associated with quality profession alism, broad areas include: (a) adherence to the APA Ethical Code of Conduct for Psychologists, institution policies and procedures, and applicable Rev. 08/2 2 Page 17 state of Florida laws, clinical competence (as defined above under performance evaluations); (b) professional comportment, including: dependability; accepting responsibility for own work; professional grooming, attire, and demeanor; and demonstrating maturity, discretion, sound professional judgment and a respectful/non -hostile attitude, developing self-asses sment skills; and (c) a positive attitude toward others, including: cooperating and respecting others, giving, accepting, and utilizing constructive feedback, and developing and maintaining positive working relationships with peers, supervisors, and others. Step 1: If the intern continues to struggle with the problem areas, and/or the intern's performance competencies are rated below satisfactory levels during quarterly evaluations, a performance improvement plan will be developed to remediate any deficient areas. The performance improvement plan must be signed by the intern and primary supervisor, and a copy forwarded to the Director of Internship Training. The performance improvement plan will focus on impro ving minimum competencies and/or professionalism within a clearly defined timeframe. Remediation strategies may include increased supervision, additional readings, increased opportunities to practice, additional coursework, etc. Step 2: If the supervisor and intern could not reach an agreement about the performance improvement plan, the Director of Internship Training would mediate the situation. Step 3: If the Director of Internship Training was unable to resolve the situation, consultation would be requested from the intern's graduate program Director of Clinical Training to aid with the resolution of the problem, and development of a performance improvement plan. Decisions regarding problem resolution are individual and specific to the facts related to each intern. Step 4: If minimum competencies are not attained within the established timeframe of the performance improvement plan, disciplinary action (including dismissal from the internship program), in keeping with rules and regulations covering disciplinary actions outlined by NSU's Office of Human Resources, may be warranted. NSU's Office of Human Resources will be contacted for approval prior to administering disciplinary action beyond a verbal warning. The Director of Internship Training investigates any behaviors that may warrant disciplinary action and is consulted prior to the recommendation of any disciplinary action. The intern would meet with the Director of Internship Training, and a representative from the university community of hi s/her choosing, if desired. The Director of Internship Training would present the results of the investigation and make a recommendation to the Dean of the COP, with whom the intern could also meet, and a decision would be made regarding any further action. The Director of Clinical Training for the intern's doctoral program would be kept apprised of the progress. The PSC supervisor(s) would be informed about any decisions or actions taken by the university. The intern could appeal any disciplinary action affecting employment to the N SU Office of Human Resources. If the intern is also an NSU doctoral student, the intern could appeal to the Dean of COP regarding disciplinary actions affecting academic standing. Appeals Rev. 08/2 2 Page 18 Interns wishing to contest disciplinary decisions with the NSU Office of Human Resources must follow NSU's Formal Grievance Hearing Policy: http://www.nova.edu/cwis/hrd/emphanbk/hearing.html. If the intern is also an NSU doctoral student and wish es to contest disciplinary decisions affecting academic standing, he/she must submit a written appeal with the Dean of COP within 30 working days of the decision. Additional steps to be taken by the Dean are outlined in the respective COP Ph.D or Psy.D. Policy and Procedure Handbooks. Intern Grievances The COP and PSC internship program faculty and supervisors value professionalism, honesty, and ethical conduct in the handling of intern concerns. At all times, matters are handled in the spirit of education and development. The purpose of the intern grievance and appeals process is to allow for the orderly resolution of intern grievances. At all times, the respect and protection of interns is of utmost concern. In keeping with the policy of NSU's Office of Human Resources, interns who file a grievance will not be retaliated against through any adverse action by their supervisor or any NSU representative. If an intern has a grievance about his/her training, the following steps should be taken: Step 1: The intern should work with his/her supervisor to resolve the issue. Step 2: If a resolution is not achieved, the intern should advise the Director of Internship Training, who would attempt to mediate or resolve the concern. Should the issue involve the Director of Internship Training, the intern would advise the PSC Chief Psychologist who would attempt to mediate or resolve the situation. Step 3: If the intern believes that the informal process above is unsu ccessful in resolving the issue, the intern may file a written grievance with the Director of Internship Training (or Chief Psychologist, if grievance involves the Director of Internship Training), including a concise statement of the particular manner of harm, along with all relevant facts and compelling supporting evidence. a) The Director of Internship Training (or Chief Psychologist, if grievance involves the Director of Internship Training) will review the written document to determine if the complaint warrants further review. If no further review is warranted, the formal grievance will be terminated and the intern will be provided with a brief written explanation. If further review i s warranted, the grievance will be forwarded to the PSC Internship training committee, comprised of all internship supervisors except the person or persons involved in the grievance . b) The training committee will conduct a substantive review of all facts it deems pertinent to the grievance and, at its discretion, may interview the intern or any other pertinent person that it judges has the information relevant to the review. c) The training committee will file a written recommendation, with justification, to the Dean of the COP, who will render a final decision. It is the responsibility of the Director of Internship Training (or Chief Psychologist if the Director of Internship Training is involved) to follow up on the response to these recommendations by ensuring Rev. 08/2 2 Page 19 that supervisors or others implicated in the intern grievance submit responses to the training committee and that all decisions are implemented by the program. APPLICATION PROCESS Applicants considered for an internship at Nova Southeas tern University Psychology Services Center must be enrolled in APA accredited, doctoral program in clinical, counseling or school psychology.

This internship site agrees to abide by the APPIC Policy that no person at thi s training facility will solicit, accept or use any ranking-related information from any intern applicant. Rev. 08/2 2 Page 20 Following the Match, interns will be required to complete a background screening prior to beginning internship. Prior to starting, interns will also be required to attend a two-day PSC Orientation, usually scheduled for a Tuesday and Friday within the same week in mid-August. STIPEND/BENEFITS The stipend is $24,000 for a 12-month period. Leave time includes three week s (15 days) paid vacation, 11 sick days, 3 personal days, and paid university holidays. It is important to keep in mind that 2000 hours must be earned for successful program completion; therefore, interns must balance leave time with the 2000-hour requirement. During the internship year, the trainee is offered health insurance coverage, liability insurance and other fringe benefits as determined by University policy. Interns have access to all university facilities, including the libraries and recreational facilities. It should be noted that health insurance benefits through NSU are not likely to become active until September, at the earliest; therefore, interns hoping to use employment benefits to cover their parent university's health insurance coverage requirement should make arrangements for alternative coverage for the time between the start of the intern's academic semester and the health insurance coverage start at the internship site. THE REGION Nova Southeastern University and the Psychology Services Center are located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The area is noted for its year-round mild climate, beaches, resorts, and outdoor recreational activities. With easy accessibility to downtown Fort Lauderdale and Miami, there are many cultural resources including libraries, and philharmonics, ballet and theatrical companies. Ther e are several universities and colleges in the Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach County area. Lectures and workshops by visiting scholars occur frequently at NSU and within the surrounding tri-county area. ETHICAL PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGISTS AND CODE OF CONDUCT Interns are expected to adhere scrupulously to the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and code of conduct, which can be accessed at http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/ . NSU CAMPUSWIDE POLICIES NSU Nondiscrimination Statement Consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, regulations, and/or local ordinances (e.g., Title VII, Title VI, Title III, Title II, Rehab Act, ADA, Title IX, and the Florida Civil Rights Act), it is the policy of Nova Southeastern University not to engage in discrimination or harassment against any persons because of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, military service, veteran status, political beliefs or affiliations, and to comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, orders, and regulations. Any such acts are unacceptable and strictly prohibited by the university. Rev. 08/2 2 Page 21 In addition, the law prohibits retaliation against an individual for opposing any practices forbidden under this policy, for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment, for assisting someone with such a complaint, for attempting to stop such discrimination or harassment, or for participating in any manner in any investigation or resolution of a complaint of discrimination or harassment. This nondiscrimination policy applies to admissions, enrollment, sch olarships, loan programs, athletics, employment, and access to, participation in, and treatment in all university centers, programs, and activities. NSU admits students of any race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy status, national or ethnic origin, nondisqualifying disability, age, ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, military service, veteran status, political beliefs or affiliations, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at NSU and does not discriminate in the administration of its educational policies, admission policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school administered programs. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act and the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) Part 86, requires Nova Southeastern University to distribute the University's policy on alcohol and controlled substances to all students.

Interns will gain knowl edge of theories and methods of Program Evaluation during two didactic sessions. After the first didactic, they will collaborate with their site supervisors on carrying out a program evaluation, applying the Logic Model method. During the second didactic, interns' group project will be reviewed and they will be trained on delivering program evaluation feedback to stakeholders. Over the summer, interns will present results and supervisor overseeing project will complete the Interns' Program Evaluation Projec t Observation Form. Rationale: It is important that Psychology interns understand and are able to apply Program Evaluation theories and methods in their future work as Psychologists. Given that psychologists should demonstrate clear evidence of effectiven ess in achieving desired goals, conducting formal program evaluations is one way to be rigorous in this endeavor. This three - part training activity will expose interns to various theories and methods of program evaluation and gauge learning with pre-and po st-tests. In addition, interns will have the opportunity to apply these new skills through a small -group program evaluation project using a Logic Model . Learning Objectives and Outcomes: Interns will demonstrate intermediate to advanced levels of competen cy in program evaluation knowledge and skills. Interns who successfully complete this training will be able to: 1) Demonstrate knowledge of the theories and methods of Program Evaluation. 2) Demonstrate the ability to develop a logic model that is relevant to th eir current work. 3) List 1- 2 ways in which a logic model may be helpful. Activities: Interns will complete the Program Evaluation Pre -test Interns will attend two Program Evaluation didactic presentations Interns will complete the Program Evaluation Post -test. Interns will plan and execute a small -group program evaluation, using a Logic Model. Interns will provide feedback to stakeholders about the outcome of their program evaluation group project. Interns' performance will be evaluated by supervisor suing the Interns' Program Evaluation Project Observation Form. Outcome Measures: Pre- and Post- tests Evaluation of Intern competencies in program evaluation using the Program Evaluation Knowledge and Skills Rating Form Evaluation by the Intern's supervisors of Intern competencies in program evaluation using the Intern Quarterly Evaluation based on feedback from the Program Evaluation Knowledge and Skills Rating Form as well as any other available evidence from site -based program evaluatio n activities (e.g., Interns' Program Evaluation Project Observation Form).

Space is provided for narrative description of the trainee's level of functioning, as well as for noting direct observations of intern competency. Please remember that all ratings should be made relative to the level of performance expected given the point of the year at w hich the evaluation is conducted. Specifically, it is expected that during the beginning of the training year, most interns demonstrate minimal to basic knowledge, skills, and abilities (corresponding to ratings of 1 or 2). As the year progresses, interns' knowledge, skills, and abilities are expected to increase, so that by the end of the training year, they are expected to demonstrate intermediate to advanced levels of competency (corresponding to ratings of 3 or 4) in each of the 9 profession -wide compet encies.
