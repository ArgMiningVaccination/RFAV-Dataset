This will be a process that will happen over a few weeks, as there are many elements to be installed, but the fact that even the \"boxes' are coming is a sure sign that the end cannot be far! They sealed the kitchen floors over the weekend again in preparation for the kitchen and after being covered up right away after they were installed I never really got a chance to sit and admire them. Well, suffice to say I spent plenty of time this weekend just standing, staring and LOVING my kitchen floors. I am truly in love with them....crazy sounding as it might be! Will be sure to update on Thursday.? Don't you just love a gorgeous crystal chandelier and what it adds to a room? Putting the sparkle factor aside, it adds a sense of old worldness, grandeur and has a beautiful way of anchoring a room. Chandeliers are by no means reserved strictly for traditional rooms but in fact work beautifully in even the most modern rooms too. Whats more, you see them well, just about everywhere today. In laundry rooms, back mud rooms, closets, dressing rooms, bathrooms, so many unexpected places and of course as expected in ?bedrooms, living, dining rooms and kitchens. Today I look at many different styles in many different types of settings. There is not a bad choice amongst them, each quite exquisite in my view. What are your thoughts on crystal chandeliers?
