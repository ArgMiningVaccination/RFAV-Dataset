Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the stor y of the Good Samaritan, which LLU has taken as a central symbol for our work. INTEGRITY --The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well -considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustwo rthiness. EXCELLENCE --The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM --The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery, but to freedom. JUSTICE --The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually, to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could only be genuine when it led t he believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY/SELF --CONTROL -Morally upright and moderate in all things with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. HUMILITY --The willingnes s to serve others in a sacrificial manner; the self -respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance.

Their address is 1111 No rth Fairfax Street, Alexandria, VA 22314. 703 -684-2782. Current accreditation is granted through June 20 22 STUDENT Application to and enrollment in the University constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide RESPONSIBILITY: by the academ ic and social practices and regulations stated in announcements, catalogs , handbooks, and other published materials, and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the University's function as an institution of higher learning. A student who neglects academic or other student duties, whose social conduct is unbecoming, or whose attitudes demonstrate deficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity, inevitably will come under question. The faculty then reviews the case, appraises the student's fitness for a career in this chosen profession, and recommends to the dean appropriate action as to the student's continuance or discontinuance from the program. CLASS OFFICERS: During Fall quarter of your first and seco nd year you will elect class officers to organize and represent your class. Class officers donate a considerable amount of time to the class. It is therefore recommended that any student that is struggling academically, should not jeopardize their standi ng in the program by taking on extra responsibilities of this nature. Listed below are the offices that are traditionally filled, and a description of their duties. President: A mature spiritual leader, able to organize the class and promote a cohesivenes s that will bind the class together during your time at LLU. The president is the class spokesperson and is present at faculty meetings to represent you. Vice -President: Similar characteristics to president. Able to take over when president is not availa ble. Also your representative at faculty meetings. Secretary/Treasurer: Someone that is very good at handling the money and making arrangements that need to be made for class functions. A class account is opened at student finance. This person would be responsible for operating the account. Social Vice Presidents: We often have two people, often different genders. These people arrange social activities, (eg. Groups that to in to watch taping of TV shows, camping trips, beach trips etc.). Sports Reps: These two individuals are one male, one female and organize male and female sporting teams and activities. They should have an ability to organize teams in an impartial manner to maintain class cohesiveness. Chaplain/s: Someone who is interested and willi ng to work with the faculty and class to organize activities of a spiritual nature, (eg. Vespers at the beach, mountain retreat, prayer groups, Bible fellowship groups, class service projects etc.). Historian: Wants to keep the class together after you ha ve all left the University. Someone who will keep records of where you are (as much as you tell that individual!). Maybe send out an annual newsletter update. APTA Representative: Someone really interested in our professional organization and what it does for us in the PT field. Attends local monthly APTA meetings and reports to the class any changes that may affect you. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -17- STUDENT AWARDS: At the end of your program, the faculty will select individuals in your class for distinction with the following awar ds: Physical Therapy Faculty Award - In recognition for demonstrating outstanding potential and promise in the profession of physical therapy.

Noti fying the department, while required, does not necessarily excuse the absence. It is the responsibility of the student to obtain any information that was given in his/her absence. If an examination is missed, you must notify the department prior to the a bsence and you are to contact the instructor within 48 hours to see if a make -up is possible. ACADEMIC Acts of dishonesty -including theft, plagiarism, giving or obtaining information in examinations or INTEGRITY: other academic exercises, or knowingl y giving false information, is unacceptable for students in the School. Instructors and students are charged with the responsibility of reporting instances of such behavior to the department program director/chairperson. The department program director/ch airperson is responsible for investigation. Substantiated violations will be brought before the Department faculty for disciplinary action. Such action may include, but is not limited to, academic probation or dismissal from the program. The educational and practical experiences utilized during classes which have laboratory activities are intended to provide the student with the best preparatory experience for the actual practice of physical therapy in the clinical setting. The lab practical testing for mats are designed to be similar to clinical situations. To allow all students to participate in this simulated clinical situation, it is anticipated that there will be a significant time lag between the initiation of the practical by the first student the rapist and the completion of the lab practical by the last student therapist. This time lag can allow opportunity for the students to disseminate practical information to other students. This sharing of information is considered to be an act of academic dishonesty and is strictly prohibited! ACCOMMODATIONS: If you are an individual with a disability and need reasonable accommodation to fully participate in this program, please obtain the Student Information and Requested Accommodation forms from Dr. Cra ig Jackson, Dean, School of Allied Health Professions in Nichol Hall Room 1603. Accommodations, if granted, are for the didactic portion of the curriculum. Additional requests would need to be made for the clinical portion of the curriculum. As it is th e responsibility of the program to develop the student into an entry -level clinician, time accommodations in the clinical setting may not be appropriate. ADDING/DROPPING Students may change their schedule by completing a Change of Program form available o n line at www.llu.edu/ssweb . The last day to add a course is five days after the beginning of instruction of the quarter. The last day to drop a course without record on the transcript is 10 school days after the beginning of instruction of the quarter. A \"W\" (withdraw) will be recorded on the transcript for courses dropped prior to 14 calendar days before the final examination week. Courses may not be withdrawn after that date. ADMISSIONS: Students are admitt ed into the physical therapy programs based on the following: 1. Satisfactorily completing all prerequisites prior to the program starting with a minimum GPA as follows: Overall pre -requisites 3. 4 Science pre -requisites 3. 4 Non-science pre -requisites 3. 4 2. Personal interview with one of the faculty 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -24- AMERICAN All students are required to belong to the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) while enrolled PHYSICAL in the program. The student is encouraged to read the journal and attend the APTA -sponsored meetings. THERAPY The department gives up to $ 5000 per year, per class, to assist students in attending APTA sponsored ASSOCIATION: meetings. The guidelines are as follows: 1. Department will pay the registration fee for up to two stu dent representatives to attend APTA conventions with the following restrictions: a. Department will pay up to $200 registration fees per convention (Ex: $100 per representative for two representative, or $200 for one representative) c. Department will pay registration fees up to two conventions per year 2. In addition to the above stated support, the Department will pay up to $5 000 per class per fiscal year for student attendance at APTA conventions with the following restrictions: a. Student must submit rece ipts for reimbursement. Expenses for which the student is eligible for reimbursement are registration, lodging, transportation, and meals. d. Maximum meal allowance per day is set by the University ( January 2014 , $46/day) e. Maximum mileage allowance is set by the University ( January 2014 , $0.45/mile) 3. With class officers' approval, the APTA representative may receive money from both #1 and #2 for the same convention. ATTENDANCE: Regular class and lab attendance is expected of all students. Specific r equirements and final authority for attendance and any effect it might have upon grades, rests with the individual faculty member. However, students who miss more than 20% of regular class/lab sessions, even if absences are considered \"excusable,\" may be required to drop the course. Arriving more than 30 minutes late is considered an absence. The specific rules for each course will be listed in the class syllabus and be made clear on the first day of class. Pagers and cell phones need to be on silent or vibrate during class time. BACKGROUND Loma Linda University requires that all students have a background check completed at the time of CHECKS: initial registration in June. The Department is required to send documentation to clinical sites prio r to students attending their clinics for rotations (Practicums or Affiliations). Therefore, student in the DPT program will be required to have background checks at the following times within the program: Summer Quarter of First year Initial Back ground Check Spring Quarter of First year Updated Background Check Spring Quarter of Second year Updated Background Check If a student receives a \"Hit\" on their background check, the cause of the \"hit\" is reviewed by legal counsel for the Uni versity. If legal counsel determines that the nature of the misdemeanor/felony is such that the student should not be allowed to complete a clinical rotation in one of the facilities within Loma Linda University Health, the Department will be notified. I t is possible, that other facilities with which we have contract s would take the student, but placement will become more difficult. In addition, the student needs to recognize that having a misdemeanor or felony on their record may prevent them from sitti ng the National Physical Therapy Examination or becoming a licensed physical therapist. Students who have any questions on this issue are encouraged to meet with the program director. CHAPEL: Every Wednesday from 11:00-12:00 am during Fall, Winter and Spring quarters, the student body meets in the University Church of Seventh -day Adventist for a university wide chapel service. Students are expected to attend each week of the quarter. If a student does not have a class or laboratory scheduled prior to 3:00pm on Wednesday, they are not required to attend chapel. Students are allowed two absences during the quarter. If a student is absent for more than two chapels in one quarter, the student must listen to the audio recording of the missed chapel and w rite a 1 -2 page reaction paper. The reaction paper is to be turned in to the program director or designate . If a student does not complete the reaction paper, a registration hold may be placed on the student 's registration packet. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -25- CLINICAL Clinical E ducation refers to that portion of your education spent in full -time (40 hrs/wk) clinical EDUCATION: environments, including inpatient settings (acute and subacute hospitals and medical centers, rehab centers, skilled nursing facilities) and outpatient se ttings (private practice, pediatric, geriatric, rehab, wellness centers, sports medicine). Your year -at-a-glance schedule reveals how the clinical and academic portions are integrated with short practiums and long affiliations. Please study your schedule carefully before planning vacations, weddings or special events so that clinical assignments will not be interrupted. Advance permission must be obtained from the academic faculty and the clinical faculty before any adjustments may be made to your clinica l schedule. All clinical assignments are made by the academic coordinator of clinical education (ACCE) or designate. Management and supervision of the clinical experiences are divided for practical purposes between the ACCEs , with DPT affiliations prima rily overseen by Theresa Joseph, PT, MBA (Rm 1808 ext 87744 ) and practicums primarily overseen by Nicceta Davis , PT, PhD (Rm 1900 ext 83695 ). Students must not contact clinical facilities regarding clinical education unless given specific permission by e ither the ACCE or designate. The Department of the Physical Therapy, via the Office of the Dean, School of Allied Health Professions, currently holds approximately 900 active affiliation agreements with clinical facilities in almost every state . Clinica l assignments will be drawn primarily from this collection because the development of new agreements is both expensive and time -consuming. Requests for new sites will be considered only after active resources have been exhausted and on the basis of predic ted value for future students and must be submitted at least six to nine months in advance. Because of the limited number of local facilities available, assignments cannot be made on the basis of the student's family, marital status or personal prefere nce. Although the department makes every effort to accommodate the student's preference, the student agrees to accept the clinical assignments made by the department at any of the affiliated facilities, whether local or out of state. Competition among sc hools for access to clinical education sites in California is keen. Our PT and PTA programs cooperate with the consortium of ACCEs from other PT and PTA programs in southern California called IACCC (Interscholastic Academic Clinical Coordinators Council). One of the objectives of IACCC is to improve communication between the academic programs and the clinical sites common to the group, particularly with regards to clinical education needs. Thus, we have the most effective means for securing clinical rotat ions in competitive sites, but we are also limited by the needs of other programs. COMMUNICATION: Your University email address is the official method by which the University and the Department will communicate with you. The Department of Physical Thera py will use this method to make general announcements to the class and specific announcement to you as an individual. Please make sure that you check this often so that you do not miss anything. COMPLAINTS: There may be a time while enrolled in the pr ogram that a student has a complaint. The following are the steps, in successive order, which a student should follow 1. Discuss the issue with the instructor/coordinator of the course. 2. Discuss the issue with the program director - Larry Chinnock 3. Discuss the issue with the department Chair - Larry Chinnock 4. Discuss the issue with the Dean of the School of Allied Health Professions - Craig Jackson DISMISSAL/ A student who is involved in dismissal proceedings or who has an academic or clinical grievance may GRIEVANCE: proceed as follows: 1. The student should first discuss the problem or grievance with the instructor. If, following discussion with the instructor, the student is not satisfied and continues to believe that (s)he has not been dealt with fairly, the student may discuss the grievance with the chairperson or program director of the department. 2. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student has recourse to the Office of the Dean. 3. As a final appeal, the student may request the dean to appoint a faculty review committee of three (3) 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -26- members to evaluate the situation and make a recommendation to the dean. This request should be presented in writing and include pertinent information regarding the situation. The student may request to meet with th e review committee for discussion of the case. 4. The grievance must be filed within one quarter of the incident in question. EXAMINATION GENERAL EXAMINATION POLICY: Academic dishonesty is not tolerated. Multiple questions and/or POLICY: answer exam for mats and video surveillance may be used to facilitate the educational success of all studen ts. 1.

Do not expect to be out of your last final for the quarter before 12:00 pm on Thursday of Finals Week. Do not make any travel arrangements that will conflict with this schedule. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -27- GRADING: Most courses will be graded on the Scaled Score (SS) system with a SS of 325 considered to be a minimal acceptable level. If the SS is less than 325 other factors such as spread or percent may be used to determine the grade. A 75% is accepted as a min imal level. Grade determination will be made with consultation of the Grade Review Committee. The following scale scores will be used as guidelines when determining grades: Scale Score Percent Grade 590 and above 95% and A Below 315 below 74% F For classes graded on straight percentage, the following percentages will be used as guidelines when determining grades: Percent Grade 95-100 A C 73-74 D Below 7 3 F GRADUATION A Doctor of Physical Therapy Student must have a minimum grade point average of 3.0, with no grade less REQUIREMENT: than C. JURY DUTY: If you receive a jury summons while in the program, please bring it to Barbara Cassimy. We have a form letter that we can give you th at most of the time will excuse you from jury service until the end of the program. PARKING: All stu dents must register their vehicle if they drive and park on campus. Please see the \"Forms\" section for instructions on how to register your vehicle. PROMOTION AND Each student's record is reviewed quarterly by the faculty. Promotion is contingent on sat isfactory PROBATION: academic and professional performance and on factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the School and of the profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain a 3.0 program grade point average . Specifically, a student whose grade point average falls below the minimum required for the degree in any term, or who receives in any required course a grade less than a C (2.0), or whose clinic al performance is unsatisfactory, is automatically placed on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the department will notify the student in writing. As ana tomy is a foundational course for the entire program, because it is worth 9 units, and due to the gpa graduation requirements, students in the DPT program must receive a minimum grade of B (3.0) in the course to progress in the program. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -28- REGISTRATION: Registration begins three week s before Summer quarter. All students must clear with Student Finance to validate their registration. Registrations will be automatically dropped for students who have not obtained financial clearance prior to the first day of the quarter. In order to receive credit for a specific class, a student must be registered and financially cleared by the final date to add classes. Students are encouraged to register on time and are not to attend classes for which they are not register ed. A late registration period is provided to accommodate students who have been unable to complete th e registration process prior to the first day of the quarter. A late registration fee of $ 200 for the first week of late registrati on, will automaticall y be charged to the student's account by the computer during this period. RELIGION While in the physical therapy program, the students will take four religion courses for a total of 10 units. REQUIREMENT: The courses the student will take are: Christian Perspectives on Death & Dying Adventist Heritage & Health Bioethics and Society World Religions & Human Health REPEATING A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required course and is required by the faculty to do COURSES: additional work may pursue, on the recommendation of the Chair of the department and the consent of the Dean, one of the following plans. In either plan the student must re -register and pay the applicable tuition. 1. Re-register for the course paying the app licable fee. Review the course work under supervision and take a make -up examination (usually not given before a minimum of two weeks of study). A passing grade resulting from a repeat examination will be limited to a C (2.0). 2. Repeat the course the next time it is taught, attend all classes and/or laboratories, and take the final course examination. This option may delay the student's progression through the program. Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the student's permanent academic record, but only the last grade is computed in the grade point average. A course may be repeated only one time. REQUEST FOR To take an examination at a time other than when it is scheduled, a student must secure the consent of the SPECIAL EXAM instructor, the faculty and the chair of the department and file a \"Request for Special Examination\" with the department. A $50.00 fee is charged for a special examination REQUIRED TEXT: Each student must obtain a copy of the req uired textbooks within the first two weeks of the quarter. Books not purchased within two weeks will be returned to the publisher by the bookstore. It will then become the student's responsibility to obtain the textbook on his/her own. SCHOLASTIC A DP T student must receive a B (3.0) or better in Anatomy (AHCJ 510) to continue in the program. QUALIFICATIONS/ Each student's record is reviewed quarterly by the faculty. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory DISQUALIFICATIONS: academic and profession al performance and on factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the School and the profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain a 3.0 program grade poi nt average: A student whose grade point average falls below the minimum required for the degree in any term, or who receives in any required courses a grade less than C (2.0) , or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory, is automatically placed on aca demic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the case is referred to the Administrative Council of the School for final action. A student who is on academic probati on and fails to make the minimum required grade point average the following quarter or fails to have an overall minimum grade point average after two quarters will have disqualified him/herself from the program. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -29- If a student receives an unsatisfactory g rade, they will receive \"disqualification points\" equal to the academic units of that course. A student who receives a cumulative total of 6 points has disqualified himself/herself from the program. When a student repeats a course in which they received an unsatisfactory grade, the points received by the student continue to be in effect. A student who's grade point average (GPA) falls below 3.0 for the DPT at the completion of spring quarter, 2nd year has scholastically disqualified himself/herself from the program. A student who receives a second unsatisfactory grade in a clinical assignment has disqualified himself/herself from the program. SEXUAL Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the University. It subverts the missio n HARASSMENT: of the University, and threatens the careers, educational experience, and well -being of students, faculty, employees, and patients. Please refer to Loma Linda University's Sexual Harassment Policy in the front pocket of the Physical Therap y Student Handbook STANDARDS OF The purpose of education, especially Christian education, is to enhance intellectual, social, emotional, ACADEMIC physical, and spiritual development of students at the same time that they are learning the skills of a COND UCT: profession. In the classroom, students shall be responsible to and respectful of their peers by avoiding any behavior that would disrupt the learning environment. Cheating is not tolerated. Cheating robs the student of an opportunity to learn and undermines relationships among peers as well as students and teachers. Where cheating is known, but not confronted, it ultimately allows a toleration of dishonesty, that if carried over into professional practice may result in abuse of patients and malpracti ce problems. For these reasons, cheating will not be tolerated and will be dealt with as a matter of serious discipline. Some types of violations of ethical conduct encountered in educational programs in the health -related professions are of particular co ncern. The following examples are illustrative but are not intended to be a complete list of concerns. 1. Academic dishonesty Academic dishonesty involves a willful perversion of the truth in an academic setting. Examples include, but are not limited to: a. copying from peers, or knowingly and willingly permitting or assisting others to copy from examinations, assignments, or lab materials; b. using unauthorized aids for examinations, quizzes, assignments, clinicals, and laboratory procedures; c. looki ng at another individual's examination or quiz in a way that appears that information is being sought; d. plagiarizing, which includes the undocumented use of sources or ideas, whether quoted or paraphrased, or otherwise presented as one's own; e. fabric ation and/or fraudulent insertion of scholarly materials, not the product of one's own efforts, into assignments or clinical records; f. interfering in a harmful way with another's work (e.g., sabotaging laboratory work, or illicit entry or deletion of co mputer data); g. writing a test, or examination, or assignment for another student, or having another person wrongfully write an examination for a third party. h. misrepresenting the attendance of self or of another party in a required class, laboratory or assembly; or 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -30- i. altering grades or arranging for others to wrongfully alter grades on tests or examinations, instructors' records, or records of the school or University. 2. Forgery Forgery consists of the falsifying of signatures, altering of the content of documents after they have been signed, and may include other forms of lying or intentional misrepresentation. Examples of forgery include but are not limited to: a. falsifying instructors' signatures on charts or evaluation forms; b. alterin g patient records, grade forms, evaluation sheets, or other documents after a signature is received; c. signing another student's name on a classroom attendance record; or d. forging a person's signature on clinic records. TB TESTING & A growing major ity of clinical education facilities are requesting our students present documentation CLINICAL for PPD testing within the previous six months of their arrival. The following schedule has been REQUIREMENTS: devised to ensure our students have a PPD test within at least 6 months of the starting date for each clinical experience. Students who have had a positive reading of the PPD must present appropriate documentation regarding timely chest x -rays. Schedule for PPD testing 1. At Initial Registration 2. Spring Quarter, Year One (mid -April) - prior to Practicum 1 3. Winter Quarter, Year Two (late February) - prior to Practicum 3 4. Fall Quarter, Year Three (mid -October) - prior to Affiliation Two During the New Class Orientation in June, each student will sign a form giving permission for the Health Service Office to release health records to the School so that health information may be sent to the appropriate clinical facility as needed. PLEASE NOTE: Because of the volume of tests to be done, each of the above ser ies of tests will be pre- arranged and scheduled to be done as a group by the Student Health Services. The follow -up \"reading\" of the results of the test will also be done at a specific time two days following administration of the test. Students will no t be tested or \"read\" on an individual basis. TO BE ARRANGED: There will be blocks of time in your schedule that will be labeled TBA. These are periods of time that you are required to be in class. These time periods might be used by instructors to give examinations, have guest lecturers, or orient you to the affiliations. You should expect that there will be something scheduled for each TBA. The schedule for the TBA's is kept in the hallway and you should check it frequently to see if a TBA has been s cheduled. The TBA schedule will also be emailed to the students. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -31- TUITION: Tuition for 20 17-2018 school year follows.

Childr en are placed in rooms with others of their own age with the following teacher/child ratios: infants/toddlers 1:3, twos 1:6, pre -schoolers 1:8, and kindergarten 1:12. Students are encouraged to explore this resource on an hourly or daily basis for their c hildren. There is limited financial assistance available for children of University students. For more information call (909) 558-4568, or ext. 44568. Hours of operation: Monday --Friday: 6:00 a.m. -6:00 p.m. COUNSELING Student Assistance Program SERVICES : The Student Assistance Program is designed to help students excel toward their academic goals by securing assistance for personal problems, stress from everyday life, family and marital problems, alcoholism, drug abuse, financial and budget concerns, le gal issues, adjustment to life issues, and psychiatric disorders. Staff expertise, combined with the knowledge of community resources, enables the Student Assistance Program to provide comprehensive assistance to the students of LLU. There are two essenti al components of the Student Assistance Program: voluntary self -referral and referral by faculty and staff. The primary service is diagnostic evaluation and placement in services to address the individual needs of the student. Also, through the student ass istance and training and educational efforts, the students are able to develop skills surrounding stress management, communication techniques, and many other topics that can aid them in healthful living. Students are encouraged to voluntarily and privately use the program to resolve personal problems before any involvement by faculty and staff is necessary. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -36- Anyone in need of assistance may call (909) 558 -6050 or visit the clinic at the Loma Linda Health Center, 11360 Mountain View Avenue, Hartford Buildin g, Suite A, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday --Wednesday, 8:00 a.m. --8:00 p.m. on Thursday, and 8:00 a.m. --1:00 p.m. on Friday. Transportation will be provided if necessary. If a student is interested in services provided by the on -campu s University Counseling Center (see below), a referral will be made after the initial evaluation is completed. Counseling Center The University Counseling Center operates from the philosophy that students can only reach their maximum potential when their preparation for professional careers is accompanied by a parallel development of their emotional, social, and spiritual capacities. The Center implements this philosophy through a variety of services to students and their families which include: individ ual, family, marital, premarital, and group counseling; study skills, time management, and anxiety reduction training; and emergency 24 -hour crisis intervention. Many students are seen in individual, one -to-one sessions. Typical issues involve conflict and communication in relationships, dealing with symptoms of traumatic experiences, substance abuse, eating disorders, adjusting to academic rigors, or any situation which generates anxiety or depression. The Center also offers training in reducing test anxiety and improving concentration. All discussions are confidential. Services are available at no charge to students for the first nine visits. The Center is located at 11378 Mountain View Avenue, Dover Building, Suites A and B, in the Loma Linda Healt h Center. Hours of operation: Monday --Thursday: 8:00 a.m. --5:00 p.m. Friday: 8:00 a.m. --4:00 p.m. Evening hours by appointment Call (909) 558 -6028 or ext. 66028 to schedule an appointment or for more information.

These pathogens need to get inside of your body to cause disease. They may enter your body and infect you through: 1. an accidental injury ca used by a sharp object that is contaminated by Blood borne pathogens, 2. open cuts, nick and abrasions 3. mucous membranes of your mouth, eyes and nose Blood borne pathogens live in blood and other body fluids, such as sali va, semen, and vaginal secretions. In specialized areas, like laboratories, Blood borne pathogens may be in unfixed cells, tissue and organ cultures. Blood borne pathogens are not a friend to you; in fact, Blood borne pathogens can make you very sick. W hile performing your duties you may be at risk for exposure of the following Blood borne pathogens: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Ordinarily, your healthy, unbroken skin is a barrier to Blood bo rne diseases. However, when you are scratched or stuck by a bloody needle, lancet or other sharp object, your skin barrier would be broken. Air does not carry Blood borne pathogens; however, splashing or splattering them into your mucous membranes is a po ssibility for exposure while performing some procedures. It is in your best interest that you use the right barriers to minimize or eliminate your exposure to Blood borne pathogens in your work setting. Hepatitis B Virus is a vaccine -preventable disease that is caused by a virus that attacks the liver. It can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. Symptoms can include jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, or occasional nausea a nd vomiting. About one half of those infected with HBV will feel no symptoms at all. With prompt and proper treatment, over 90% of those infected with HBV will recover and clear the infection. If you are stuck with a needle or sharp contaminated with HB V, you have a 6 to 30 percent chance of developing Hepatitis B. However, remember that all employees who may potentially be exposed to Hepatitis B on the job are offered a free vaccine that will protect them from Hepatitis B. Less common than Hepatitis B is Hepatitis C. This, too, is an inflammation of the liver which 85% of the time leads to chronic liver disease. The symptoms are similar to Hepatitis B. Currently there is no vaccine for the prevention of Hepatitis C. There are newly approved antivir al drugs that may be effective in treating some people who have Hepatitis C. Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, causes AIDS. HIV causes a breakdown of the immune system and the clinical picture of HIV infections differs widely from person to person. Some persons remain apparently healthy for many years, while others become seriously ill, develop AIDS and eventually die. There is no preventive vaccine against HIV. If you are stuck with an HIV -contaminated sharp, your chances of becoming HIV positive are less than a percent. Seven ways to minimize your risk of exposure are: 1. Get vaccinated against Hepatitis B before an injury occurs. 2. Engineering controls are designed to eliminate the exposure hazard. Examples are needless IV injection ports, needle -safe syringes, needle -safe venipuncture devices, lancets with retractable blades, face shields or pocket masks with a one -way valve for mouth -to-mouth resuscitation and sharps disposal containers. 3. Work as if you and your co -work ers lives depend on it. Much of work practice controls are common sense. Listed below are several that should become your standard of practice: -Place sharps in a container without recapping, bending or breaking the used needle. -Transport specimen s in closed, leak -proof containers. -Do not eat and drink, apply cosmetics or handle contact lenses in areas where there is a chance of exposure to potentially infectious materials. -Store specimens away from food. -Handle contaminated patient equip ment with care and clean reusable equipment properly before using it on another patient. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -42- 4. Wash your hands with soap and water for 10 -15 seconds whenever the following occur: Before you: After you: Prepare or eat food Blow your nose, cough or sneeze Insert of remove contact lenses Use the bathroom Treat a cut or wound Handle garbage Tend to someone who is sick Tend to someone who is sick or injured In addition to the above, when in a patient care s etting: After removal of gloves After contact with blood or body fluids Before performing invasive procedure 5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) helps guard your skin, eyes, mouth and personal clothing from exposure to Blood born e pathogens. Your department will provide PPE that is effective for your particular job. This may consist of gloves, goggles, face shields, gowns, lab coats, aprons, clinic jackets, and/or masks. 6. Good housekeeping is everyone's responsibility. General rules would include: Clean all blood and body fluid spills promptly. Spill kits are available in your department or through Central Service. Each kit includes instructions, clean up equipment, disinfectant and PPE necessary to protect you while clean ing up a spill. Keep work surfaces and protective coverings clean. Never use your hands or feet to compact trash or soiled linen. Never pick up potentially contaminated broken glass with your hands. 7. Biohazard labels and/or signs are affixed to containe rs/bags that store, transport, or are used to ship blood or potentially infectious body fluids. These labels/signs must be orange or orange/red and are used to alert you of a potential hazard if you were to come in contact with the contents of the contain er/bag and you were not wearing PPE. The risk of infection is real and should be taken seriously. Taking necessary precautions to prevent risks will protect you from Blood borne infections. For more information on Blood borne pathogens, talk with your s upervisor/department manager, or call LLUMC Hospital Epidemiology, ext. 66115. EXPOSURE A body fluid exposure can occur if there is an exchange of body fluids into mucous membranes or into MONITORING skin that has been broken, torn or pierced. Examples of blood and body fluid exposures include: PROGRAM: A puncture with a contaminated needle. A cut or puncture with contaminated instruments. Transmission of blood or body fluids to mucous membranes, such as a splash to the eyes or mouth. If you are e xposed to blood or other body fluids, the procedure to follow is: Wash the wound(s) with soap and water or irrigate mucous membranes with water or saline. Report the incident to your supervisor immediately. Fill out two forms: Report of Accident/Illness (Form 20 -0032 -A) and Employee's Claim for Workers' Compensation Benefits (Form DWC -1) and have your supervisor sign it. Go to the Emergency Department for medical evaluation. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -43- The Exposure Monitoring program operates by: Identifying work areas where the re is a risk of exposure to Blood borne pathogens. Providing education and training on how to prevent an exposure. Evaluating and treating those who have been exposed to Blood borne pathogens such as Hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV). When reporting an exposure to Blood borne pathogens, both the Report of Accident/Illness and the Employee's Claim for Workers' Compensation Benefits must be filled out before reporting to the Emergency Department for medical evaluation. FIRE SAFE TY: Fire can be beautiful - but it can also be destructive. Risley Hall, one of our older university buildings, used to be one story taller than it is today. A fire did so much damage to the top floor that it had to be demolished. Other, smaller fires have also taken place. Late one night, a fire occurred in a patient care unit in the Medical Center. It was extinguished by the sprinkler system and the damage was minimal, but the clean -up was extensive. The bottom line is that everyone needs to be cons tantly vigilant to stop fires. Prevention : The best way to stop fires is to keep them from getting started. Some of the benefits of preventing fires are: we don't have to worry about injury or death from a fire, we won't have to clean up afterwards, and we don't have to listen to the fire alarm! The basic elements that are needed to create a fire are: fuel - combustible materials heat - to get the fuel burning (could be sparks) oxygen - needed for all fires, and the more the merrier! We can preve nt fires by keeping these three elements separate. Do not allow fuel to accumulate, e.g. paper, sawdust, dirty linen and oily rags Oxygen can not be eliminated in very many places, but we can be careful in areas where there is or may be a higher percent age of it than normal. This includes the area around an oxygen tent, cylinder, or oxygen medical gas wall outlet. It also includes the area where substances that are oxidizers are stored, like hydrogen peroxide and chlorine. Keep combustibles and source s of heat or sparks away from these. The Fire Plan : Since prevention isn't always perfect, everyone needs to know what to do in case a fire does occur. Our basic fire response plan is called \"R.A.C.E.\" or \"the RACE Fire Plan.\" The four main steps you n eed to take if you find a fire are: RESCUE: Remove anyone who is in immediate danger, including yourself. If people are unable to get out of the room on their own, like hospital patients, assist them if you can. If possible, get someone else's assistan ce and use a 2 or 3 person carry. If you are by yourself, use a blanket to drag the patient from the room. And be sure to close the door behind you. ALARM: Turn on the alarm. Use the pull box, if your building has one, to get the Fire Department comin g and to alert others in the building. Then, using a phone a safe distance from the fire, call 911 to report it to the Security Control Center. Be prepared to give them the specific information about the fire - location, size, number of people injured, e tc. In addition to the Fire Department, an emergency response team will be sent, including Security officers, staff from engineering and housekeeping, and Respiratory Care technicians for patient care areas. CONTAIN: Close the rest of the doors in the a rea to keep the fire and smoke confined. If possible, tuck towels or sheets under the door and around the sides to help keep the smoke from spreading. EXTINGUISH: If you can do so without endangering yourself, fight the fire with an extinguisher. Use th e right extinguisher for the type of fire and follow the PASS plan to use it correctly. (See below for information on extinguishers.) 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -44- Evacuation Procedures : Be prepared to evacuate. If you are within the M.C. or C.M.C., know your horizontal (primary & secondary) relocation points. In most of the other buildings, evacuation should occur when the fire alarm sounds. Know your building evacuation procedures and external relocation points. Assist anybody who has a disability, remembering not to use the elevator unless authorized by Fire Department personnel. Remain outside until the Fire Department says it is safe to re -enter. NOTE: This plan is based on the idea that you are the only one around. If there are others in the area, get them involved, s o several steps are being done at the same time. Fire Extinguishers: Before you can fight a fire you need to know the three classes of fire you would see in normal situations and the kinds of extinguishers that are available. Classes of Fire : - Class A fires occur in combustible solids, like paper, linen, mattresses, clothing. Water puts out Class A fires very nicely. - Class B fires involve flammable liquids, like gasoline, alcohol, and some cleaning fluids. Using water on such fires would just spread the flaming liquid around. - Class C fires involve electrical equipment, such as TV's, computers and beds with motors in them. Using water on this kind of equipment could get you electrocuted. Types of Fire Extinguishers : Water - the tall, silver can with a hose contains water under pressure. Good for class A fires only. Carbon dioxide (CO2) - the red extinguisher with the plastic horn contains CO2 under pressure. Good for class B & C fires only. Dry chemical - generally red, may have a hose or just a short nozzle. Usually good for all three classes of fire (A,B,C). Also called multi -purpose extinguishers. This is the kind you will find in most locations. Halon - generally red with a yellow -green label. Primarily f or electronic equipment, but good for class B & C fires. If large enough, can also handle class A fires. Usually found only where there is a lot of electronic equipment. To understand how to use a fire extinguisher, you need to know the acronym PASS and what it stands for. When the first three steps of RACE have been taken care of, you are ready to attempt to extinguish the fire - If you can do so without endangering yourself! If the fire is too big, close the door and wait for the guys with the big hoses - the Fire Department. But, if the fire is still small, and if you have a clear exit from the fire in case it does get out of hand, grab the proper fire extinguisher from its cabinet or hook, and follow these steps: PULL the pin. You will hav e to break the plastic tie that holds it in place. The easiest way is to turn it like a key in a lock. Or give it a good, sharp yank. AIM at the base of the fire. Keep the extinguisher itself upright, and point the hose or horn at the fire. If you're using a CO2 extinguisher, let go of the horn - it will stay where you aim it. SQUEEZE the handle. This activates the extinguisher. SWEEP from side to side, covering the whole area that's on fire. Keep this up until you are sure the fire is completely o ut, or you run out of extinguishing material. If needed, several extinguishers can be used - we have plenty! A hands -on class in the use of extinguishers is held each Fall, and all employees are urged to take it their first year of employment and at leas t every three years thereafter. Some staff are required to take it every year due to their particular job requirements. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -45- Finally, learn and remember the following: RACE and PASS as described previously in this section. And be ready to put them into a ction right away when needed. Evacuation Plan - Know where your relocation points are and how to evacuate yourself and others. Be ready to assist any visitors, disa bled employees or students as needed. HAZARDOUS Hazardous materials are things that can harm you if you are exposed to them. They can be chemical or MATERIALS biological materials and be found as a solid, liquid or gas. Hazardous materials are found i n almost SAFETY: every work environment. Work areas like Housekeeping, Engineering, offices, laboratories, and even patient care can have hazardous materials. Materials are classified by both the manufacturer and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA ) as hazardous if they can burn easily, corrode or destroy living tissue or metals, cause cancer, react with other materials, or cause an infection or disease. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) regulates employees' use of and exposure to hazardous materials through our Hazard Communication program. This program gives employees their Right -to-Know information through two main sources of information: labels and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). Hazardous materials are required to be labeled appropriately by both OSHA and EPA. The label is your first warning that the material with which you are working is hazardous and why it is hazardous to you. Since there is only a small amount of space on a label, it will give a warning statemen t to tell you this information. If you see \"Warning,\" \"Caution,\" or \"Danger,\" it means that this material is potentially harmful to your health and safety. Hazardous material labels must include the name of the product, a list of ingredients, the name an d address of the manufacturer and a warning statement. MSDS are written by the manufacturer of the product to tell employees the specific hazards with using that product. The Office of Hazardous Materials Safety (OHMS) and your supervisor are your source s of MSDS. Types of information which can be found on a MSDS are: Hazardous Ingredients - a list of the hazardous components Physical and Chemical Characteristics - boiling point, density, vapor pressure Fire and Explosion Hazards - flash point, fire fighting procedures, flammable limits Reactivity - incompatible materials, stability, decomposition products Health Hazards - routes of entry, signs and symptoms of exposure, emergency and first aid procedures Precautions for Safe Handling - spill p rocedures, storage and handling precautions Control Measures - personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilation, safe work practices Hazardous Material Exposures : The best treatment for an exposure to a hazardous material is prevention. By reading the label and MSDS, practicing good housekeeping techniques, using the right PPE and eliminating shortcuts, you can minimize your risk of exposure to the hazardous materials with which you work. However, if you or a co -worker is exposed, follow these steps to reduce the injury. Consult the label and MSDS to identify the material. Decontaminate the affected body part (e.g., eyes, hands) with running water for at least 15 minutes. Report the incident to your supervisor immediately and fill out the right notif ication forms. Report (with your forms) to the Occupational Health Center or the Emergency Department for medical evaluation and follow -up. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -46- Hazardous Material Spills : Again, prevention is the best way to avoid spilling a hazardous material (see the above section for preventive techniques). If a hazardous material has been spilled, follow these steps to minimize the risk of you and others being exposed to it. Identify the material using the container label and MSDS. Confine or contain the spill. Try to keep it from spreading. Evacuate affected areas in an emergency. For example, the material is giving off vapors and it's difficult to breathe. Use a spill kit for spills of mercury, blood and body fluids, or chemotherapy materials. Spill ki ts are available from Central Service. If this is a different type of hazardous material and not any of the materials listed above, call the Security Control Center and have the officer page OHMS staff for clean up. Don't try to clean it up yourself. 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -47- FORMS 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -48- 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -49- 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -50- 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -51- LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL THERAPY STUDENT CONSENT FORM I, , hereby voluntarily agree and consent to the followi ng: (Print Name) (please initial) I understand that while I am enrolled in the Department of Physical Therapy, School of Allied Health Profes sions, Loma Linda University I will be involved in activities that may increase my risk of injury or i llness above those associated with everyday activities of daily living.

Signature___________________________________ Date__________________________ 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -84- 2018 DPT Student Handbook Page -85- LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL THERAPY Professional Standards Since you have chosen a professional field for your work, it is important that you portray a professional image to those with whom you come in contact. Inappropriate dress, grooming, or conduct often detracts from the patient's confidence in the quality o f their care. In add ition, Loma Linda University's affiliating hospitals have standards which are reflected in the guidelines below. For these reasons , we provide the following standards which are required of you while enrolled in the program: PERSONAL GROOMING: Good taste indicates that haircuts, hairstyling, and personal grooming be neat and conservative rather than ostentatious. Grooming and style should be practical so as to enable one's duties to be performed without embarrassment or inconvenience. Specifically: 1. Men' s hair must be neatly trimmed and not fall below the collar. Ponytails, spikes and dreadlocks are not acceptable. 2. Mustaches and beards, if worn, must be neat and closely trimmed. 3. Women's hair, if long, may be required to be tied back. Spikes and dre adlocks are not acceptable. 4. The wearing of hats indoors is not acceptable. 5. Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with a Christian institution and sensitive to a diverse student population. 6. Excessive makeup and fragrances are not appropriate. 7. Rings, if worn, should be low profile and limited to one finger per hand. Male students are not allowed to wear ear ornaments . If worn by women, ear ornaments are limited to simple studs and should not drop below the bot tom of the earlobes. Such ornaments are limited to one per ear. Rings or ornaments in other anatomical sites are not acceptable . 8. Finger nails should be maintained in a professional manner, closely trimmed and should not interfere with patient safety an d comfort during treatments. Nail polish, if worn, should be of a subdued color. DRESS: General Dress: Modest casual wear is appropriate on campus and in class. Shorts must be neat and at least mid - thigh in length. Bare feet, bare midriffs or low-cut necklines are not acceptable. Lab Dress: For many classes you will have to \"dress down\" for labs. Each instructor will specify the dress that is required for their lab. Lab dress is only to be worn for labs and is not appropriate in other classroom s, the main floor of Nichol Hall or in any clinical facility. Clinical Dress: Professional dress is required for all clinical assignments, chapel attendance, and any class that is held in a clinical facility and in any class where patients are present. P rofessional dress includes; skirts/dresses of modest length or long pants (dress pants are recommended -no jeans), closed - toe shoes and name tags. Lab coats may be required in some clinical settings. Failure to observe the dress and grooming codes may re sult in your dismissal from a class or building by a member of the faculty. You will be allowed to return to the class/building when the problem is eliminated. CONDUCT: We expect you to conduct yourself in a professional manner during your didactic and clinical training. Professional conduct includes, but is not limited to, punctuality, respect of other people, their property and their right to learn. It a lso in includes an appropriate respect for those in authority. As students of Loma Linda Universi ty, we expect you to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism to yourself, this program or the University. In any public place you may be exposed to patients' relativ es and friends. Your conversation and the attitudes you display have an effect o n those around you. We request you observe the following: 1. Any information given to you by a patient or found in a medical record must be held in strict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of patients' diagnosis and treatment, and other clinically -related topics should be extremely guarded. Patients' families and community people may be listening and wrongly interpret the things you discuss. Careless talk may lead to malpractice litigation. 2. A joking or high -spirited attitude toward illness and m edical treatment should not be exhibited as it may be very disturbing to those who are ill and suffering as well as to the family members. I have read the above standards and I agree to observe them.
