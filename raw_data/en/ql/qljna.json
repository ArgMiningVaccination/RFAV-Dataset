The program will work with community organizations to join this digital platform, to further improve care coordination and access to non- health services. \"To truly achieve health equity, we need to ensure everyone can access the highest quality healthcare that enables and empowers individuals to optimize their well -being,\" said Matsui. \"The work this program will do to reach vulnerable populations is transformative. Here at UC Davis Health, they are building a digitally inclusive and accessible society, which is critical to ensuring healthcare delivery and empowering underserved communities.\" 17Digital Health Equity Program Congressional Community Funding Project Awarded $1.7M to develop Digital Health Equity Program.

Approximately 300+ safety net providers will be awarded funding. CRHD will focus specifically on low -income Latinos and farmworkers and their families in Sacramento, Butte, Colusa, Sutter and Glenn Counties.\" 1920Test-to-Treat Digital Health Equity (T2T DHE) The main goal is to pilot, refine, and demonstrate an innovative model that integrates in person community engagement using rapid testing mobile units and relying on community health workers/ promotoras combined with Direct toConsumer (DTC) telehealth service and digital health navigators. UC Davis Express Care will provide an IT infrastructure that will expand UC Davis Health's ability to partner and coordinate with FQHCs to bring more services to vulnerable patients and community members and make access to health care easier where consumers are. T2T DHE and Express Care are working with CBOs to connect patients to existing FQHC digital platforms, to increase access to care where potential users are, and improve care coordination and access to health services at the point of need. 20Source: Green LA, et al., New England Journal of Medicine, 2001;344:2021 -5.The \"Ecology\" of Medical Care -Revisited 21Selected Key themes: It is critical to listen to and co -create with individuals, caretakers, and community -based organizations on their technological needs. Community -based providers would be more likely to adopt digital health technologies if there was seamless integration with their current technologies, workflows, and systems (like electronic health records). When new technology is introduced in any community -based setting, there should be an accompanying assessment and plan for who and what is needed to fully support its implementation and sustainability. Any health system or other external organization that enters a new community should involve community members in the governance and decision -making process for any technological interventions. Even well- designed technology will never replace a trusted health care worker or provider. Community -based health care providers and organizations may struggle more than larger systems in navigating the growing sector of digital health tools and technologies that link communities and health care. Digital literacy is a real, but addressable, challenge for both individuals and health workers and providers . https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp -content/uploads/2022/05/05- 2022- Summary -of-CCH-Stakeholder -Engagement.pdf22232Integrating Digital Health Equity Program with Test to Treat Digital Health Equity (T2T DHE) and with FQHCs that got Test to Treat Equity Grants 24Coming together to serve the underserved where they are26 Innovation Technology: Epic Telehealth 27 Innovation Technology: Epic Telehealth CLINICAL WORKFORCE Community Physicians Family Medicine Internal Medicine Emergency Medicine INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY Epic Telehealth Education & Training Telehealth Help Desk CARE COORDINATION Primary Care Network Triage Nurses Patient Contact Center OPERATIONS Ambulatory Billing Legal & Compliance Teams work together -every day.

Increase the number of safety net providers that provide access to COVID- 19 therapeutics for eligible patients within 48 hours of patient presenting to care. 1 Create a \"Test to Treat Learning Community\" where best practices are shared, challenges are jointly worked on, and partnerships and coordination are strengthened across programs. 2 Leverage solutions to strengthen the safety net systems beyond COVID- 19 care such as offering other timely assessments or chronic care interventions at points of care. 3 Reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID- 19 especially among communities disproportionately impacted by COVID- 19. 4Program Goal & Objectives38Driver Category 1: Provider Engagement & Education Driver Category 2: Patient Engagement & Education Driver Category 3: Operational Workflows Driver Category 4: Data SystemsDrivers of Impact COVID -19 Diagnosis Assessment Prescribed Medication Medication Dispensed Follow -UpCOVID -19 TEST TO TREAT EQUITY PROGRAM Our Cohort55Federally Qualified Health Centers 4Tribal Health Centers 5Public Health Systems or Public Hospitals 10Community Clinics & Rural Health Clinics 1Health Network12Central California 26Los Angeles Area 11 Northern California 14San Francisco Bay Area 12Southern California Geographical Regions 75 Organizations4.37 Mil Patients being served772 Participating ClinicsWhat teams...
