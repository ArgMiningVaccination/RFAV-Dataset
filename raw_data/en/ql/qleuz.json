Signed Susan Cho Date: Agent for Hunan NutraMax Inc. (Nutramax) B. Notifier's of GRAS Substance The common name of the notified substance is Luo Han Guo fruit extracts. The subjects of the notice are Luo Han Guo ( Siraitia 90; and SweetMonkTM MV 95. D. Product Description D.1. Identity Luo Han Guo, or Siraitia grosvenori (Swingle) fruit, a traditional Chinese medicine and edible fruit, is a member of the genus Siraitia. The subject extracts are mixtures of components found in the Luo Han Guo fruit. This GRAS document discusses extract products containing 7- 95% mogroside V. These products are similar to the products described in GRNs 301, 359, 522 and 556 for which FDA has issued \"no question\" letters. The primary components of crude Luo Han Guo fruit extracts are cucurbitane glycosides (known as mogrosides, specifically mogrosides II, III, IV, V, and VI) along with flavonoids and melanoidins. Mogroside V is the major sweetness component of the fruit. It does not have a single CAS registry number. However, some of the major sweetening component have CAS Molecular process Nutramax's Luo Han Guo fruit extract p owders are manufactured in a process similar to that described in previous GRNs. However, N utramax's manufacturing process employs more purification processes to produce highly purified products (Hunan Nutramax vs. Food Chemical Codex (FCC): up to 95% mogroside V vs. 30% mogroside V) under current Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP ). The following outlines the procedures by which Nutramax processes its Luo Han Guo fruit extract powders: 1) Fresh fruit with the peel intact are selected and weighed. Mature fruits from the Luo Han Guo plant are inspected upon arrival at the processing plant. Distilled water is used for washing the fresh fruits to remove any impurities. 2 000005 2) The fruit is then crushed, while preventing crushing the fruit seeds. Then the same weight of distilled water containing enzymes (pectinase) is added and the mixture is incubated at 40 for one day. 3) Distilled water is added; the mixture is boiled at 100 ; extracted three times, each time for one hour, the third extract solution is used as the solvent for first extraction of the next batch. 4) The solutions from step 3 are then combined, cooled to room temperature, and subjected to high-speed centrifugation (5000 rpm for 30 min). To produce 45%, 60%, or 95% of the content, chitosan acetic acid (0.5% in water) is added to precipitate calcium before filtering, followed by the high-speed centrifugation. 5) The centrifugal liquid is absorbed with D101 resin (a divinylbenzene copolymer, a macroporous polymeric adsorbent) to remove impurities with 20% ethanol. This is then concentrated and dried to get product 1 (2% mogrosi de V). 6) The resin is eluted with 50% ethanol, the eluate solution is then concentrated and dried to get product 2 (18-23% mogroside V) and product 3 (24-27% mogroside V). 7) High-speed centrifugation (5000 rpm for 30 min) is used after recovering ethanol from the eluate. 8) The mixture is then centrifuged (5000 rpm for 30 min) after macroporous D900 anion exchange resin decolorization. Then concentrated and dried to get product 4 (40% mogroside V) and product 5 (45% mogroside V). 9) The decolorizing resin liquid from step 8) is further decolorized and purified by macroporous D941 ion exchange resin, and then concentrated and dried to get product 6 (50% mogroside V) and product 7 (60% mogroside V). 10) After decolorizing, a reverse phase silica gel column c hromatography (using 30% ethanol in water as a mobile phase) is used to get product 8 (90% mogroside V) and product 9 (95% mogroside V). 11) The products from steps 5-9 are then mixed with the option to specify the product. Luo han guo fruit extracts are manufactured under cGMP using common food industry materials and processes in accordance with the applicable parts of 21 CFR, part 110 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The food grade ethanol used in the purification process complies with FCC's 8th Edition specifications. The ion exchange resins and adsorption resins used in the manufacturing process comply with 21 CFR 173.25. D.3. Specifications As shown in Tables 1- 1 to 1-11, Nutramax has established the specifications for the minimum mogroside V content as well as the maximum microbiological and heavy metal levels for its Luo Han Guo fruit extracts. The specifications meet or exceed those specified by the Food Chemical Codex (FCC). 3 000006 Table 1-1.

E. Applicable Conditions for Use of the Notified Substance E.1. Current Regulatory Status The US FDA has i ssued 'no question' letters on four GRAS notifications related to food uses of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts (GRN 301, FDA, 2010; GRN 359, FDA, 2011; GRN 522, 2014; GRN 556, 2015). In addition, two New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) notifications were accepted by FDA with no objection for use of Luo Han Guo fruit extract as dietary supplement (FDA, 1996, 1999). 10 000013 E.2. Intended Use Levels and Food Categories Luo Han Guo fruit extracts, containing mogroside V as the principal sweetening component, are intended to be used as a table -top sweetener and general purpose non- nutritive sweetener and as a flavor modifier in various foods other than in infant formulas and in meat and poultry products. The intended use will be as a non-nutritive sweetener as defined in 21 CFR 170.3(o)(19). Luo Han Guo fruit extracts are intended for use in the same foods and at levels proportional to those for mogroside V specified in GRNs 301, 359, 522 an d 556. E.3. Estimated Dietary Intakes (EDIs) of Luo Han Guo Fruit Extract Based upon Intended Food Uses Using the methodology presented in GRN 301 and Renwick (2008), the EDI of the Nutramax's Luo Han Guo fruit extracts have been calculated. The EDIs for high consumers of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts ranged from 1.6 mg/kg body weight ( BW)/day (product containing 90- 95% ( mogroside V). mogroside V are 2.2 mg/kg BW/day or less . Since Nutramax 's Luo Han Guo fruit extracts will replace other Luo Han Guo fruit extract products in the marketplace, an increase in the cumulative intake is not expected. As described in Renwick (2 008) as well as in GRNs 301, 359 and 556, the EDIs for Luo Han Guo fruit extract products represent extremely optimistic estimates of the potential intake. E.4. Basis for the GRAS Determination The intended use of Luo Han Guo ( Siraitia grosvenori ) fruit extracts (SweetMonkTM; powder form) has been determined to be safe though scientific procedures as set forth in 21 CFR 170.3(b), thus satisfying the so- called \"technical\" element of the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) determination. In addition, because this safety evaluation was based on generally available and widely accepted data and information, it also satisfies the so -called \"common knowledge\" element of a GRAS determination. Safety Evaluation Numerous human and animal studies have reported benefits of Lou Han Guo fruit extracts with varying concentrations of mogroside V with no major adverse effects. The Nutramax uses a HACCP-controlled manufacturing process and rigorously tests its final production batches to verify adherence to quality control specifications. There is bro ad-based and widely disseminated knowledge concerning the chemistry of mogroside V, a major active component of Lou Han Guo fruit extracts. This GRAS determination is based on the data and information generally available and consented opinion about the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts. The literature indicates that Luo Han Guo fruit extracts offers consumers benefits without adverse effect s. The following safety evaluation fully considers the composition, intake, nutritional, microbiological, and toxicological properties of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts as well as appropriate corroborative data. 11 000014 1. Nutramax's Luo Ha n Guo fruit extracts are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) using common food industry materials and processes. 2. Analytical data from multiple lots indicate that the Luo Han Guo fruit extract powders comply reliably with the established food -grade product specifications and meet all applicable purity standards. 3. Nutramax's Luo Han G uo fruit extracts will be used as a table-top sweetener and general purpose non- nutritive sweetener and as a flavor modifier in various foods other than in infant formulas and in meat and poultry products. Intended use is the same as that was described in GRN 556. Due to the characteristic intense sweet flavor of the fruit and its derivatives, use is expected to be self- limiting. 4. The exposure estimates, estimated dietary intakes (E DI), under the intended use are estimated to be up to 2.2 mg mogroside V/kg BW/day for high consumers. For high consumers, the EDIs for Luo Han Guo fruit extracts ranged from 1.6 to 22 mg/kg BW/day, depending on the concentration of mogroside V in each Luo Han Guo fruit extract product. These levels are far below the reference dose safe for human exposure. In addition, subchronic studies reported that NOAEL s for Luo Han Guo fruit extract were over 3,120 mg/kg BW/day and 3,750 mg/kg BW/day in male and female rats, respectively (Jin et al., 2007), and those of mogroside V were over 1,717 and 2,062 mg/kg BW/day, respectively (Huntingdon Life Science, 2009). 5. The EDI estimates are based on the assumption that Nutramax's Luo Han Guo fruit extract will replace currently marketed Luo Han Guo fruit extract. Thus , cumulative exposures are not expected. In addition, the EDIs presented in this notice are highly optimistic estimates. 6. In the previous GRAS notices (GRN 301, 359, 522 and 556) to the FDA, the safety of Luo Han G uo fruit extracts had been established in toxicological studies in animals, mutagenicity studies, and is further supported by clinical studies in humans. The FDA responses to GRAS notifications on Luo Han G uo fruit extracts indicate that the FDA is satisfied with the safet y-in-use of the Luo Han Guo fruit extract, as long as consumption is less than 2.5 mg mogroside V/kg BW/day. Furthermore, historical consumption of Luo Han Guo fruit extract support the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extract. 7. An additional animal study published subsequent to the FDA GRAS notices continue to support the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extract as a food ingredient. Pursuant to 21 CFR 170.30(b), Nutramax 's Luo Han Guo fruit extracts (powder form) have been determined to be GRAS on the basis of scientific procedures. This determination is based on the views of experts who are qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts as a food ingredient. Expert Panel members, Susan S. Cho, Ph.D., Robert L. Martin , Ph.D., George C. Fahey, Jr., Ph.D., have critically reviewed and evaluated the publicly available information summarized in this document and have individually and collectively concluded that Luo Han Guo fruit extracts , produced consistent with cGMP and meeting the specifications described herein, is safe under its intended conditions of use. The Expert Panel further unanimously concludes that these uses of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts are GRAS based on scientific procedures, and that other exper ts qualified to assess the safety of food and food ingredients would concur with these conclusions. 12 000015 F. Availability of Information The detailed data and information that serve as a basis for this GRAS determination will be provided to the U. S. FDA upon request, or are available for the FDA's review and copying during reasonable business hours at the offices of NutraSource, Inc. located at 6309 Mor ning Dew Ct., Clarksville, MD 21029, USA.

INTRODUCTION The undersigned, an independent panel of recognized experts (hereinafter referred to as the Expert Panel), qualified by their scientific training and relevant national and international experience to evaluate the safety of food and food ingredients, was convened by NutraSource, Inc., at the request of Hunan NutraMax , Inc. \u00ae (hereinafter referred to as Nutramax), to determine the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status of its Luo Han Guo fruit extracts (SweetMonkTM) as a table-top sweetener and general purpose non- nutritive sweetener as defined in 21 CFR 170.3(o)(19) and as a flavor modifier in foods. A comprehensive search of the scientific literature for safety and toxicity information on Luo Han Guo fruit extract s was conducted and made available to the Expert Panel members. The Expert Panel members independently and critically evaluated materials submitted by Nutramax and other information deemed appropriate or necessary. Following an independent, critical evaluation, the Expert Panel unanimously agreed to the decision described herein. The purpose of this dossier is to (1) Outline the identity and composition of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts powders, (2) Estimate exposure under the intended condition of use, (3) Document the literature pertaining to the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts, and (4) Assemble an independent panel of recognized experts (referred to as the Expert Panel). The data and information summarized in this dossier demonstrate that the intended use of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts (powder form), produced using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and meeting food- grade specifications, is GRAS, based on scientific procedures, as described herein. I I. INFORMATION ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE NOTIFIED SUBSTANCE II.A. Background Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle, commonly known as Luo Han Guo or monk fruit, is a plant native to Southern China. Luo Han Guo fruit extracts contain varying concentrations of mogrosides, which are the non- nutritive constituents of the fruit primarily responsible for the characteristic sweetness of Luo Han Guo fruit extract s (FDA, 2015a). Luo Han Guo fruit extracts , depending on the mogroside V content, are reported to be 100 to 400 times sweeter than sugar (FDA, 2015a, 2015b). They therefore can be used as a sugar substitute. The primary components of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts are cucurbitane glycosides (known as mogrosides, specifically mogrosides II, III, IV, V, and VI) along with flavonoids and melanoidins. Mogrosides IV, V, and VI, members of the family of triterpene glycosides, are very sweet and are responsible for the sweetness of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts (Lee, 1975). In particular, mogroside V is the major sweetness component of the fruit. Mogroside V, the most abundant sweet constituent, has been found in whole fruits at concentration s of 0.8-1.3 % w/w (Makapugay et al., 1985; Pawar et al., 2013). Mogrosides are known to function as antioxidants, anti-carcinogens, and anti -inflammatory substances (Chen et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2014). Luo Han Guo fruit extract s (in both powder and liquid forms) have been introduced for use in the U.S. as a tabletop sweetener of foods. 4 000022 SweetMonkTM This GRAS document discusses extract products containing 7 - 95% mogroside V. Table 1 shows the sweetness intensity of Luo Han Guo fruit extract products when tested against a water solution of 10% sucrose. It is commonly accepted that the sweetness intensity of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts is proportional to the concentration of mogrosides present in it. However, it also depends on the conc entration of mogroside V in a particular concentrate. At high concentrations of mogrosides the sweetness may slightly level off. Given the organoleptic characteristics of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts, the amounts added to food products from any of N utramax's eleven extracts will be self -limiting. Table 1.

CLAIM OF GRAS STATUS III.A. Claim of Exemption from the Requirement for Premarket Approval Requirements Pursuant to Proposed 21 CFR \u00a7 170.36(c)(1) SweetMonk TM (common name - Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle Luo Han Guo fruit extracts [hereinafter referred to as Luo Han Guo fruit extracts]) for use as a table top sweetener and non- nutritive sweetener and as a flavor modifier has been determined to be Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) and , therefore, is exempt from the requirement of premarket approval under the conditions of its intended use as described below. The basis for this finding is described in the following sections. III.B. Common or Trade Name: The common or usual names of the Luo Han Guo fruit extracts that is the subject of this GRAS evaluation include: Luo Han Guo ( LHG), Lo Han Guo, Lor Hon Kor, Siraitia Momordicae Grosvenorii Fructus, monk fruit, magic fruit, and longevity fruit. The specific substances that are the subject of this safety evaluation are identified as Luo Han Guo (Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle) under the following trade names: MV 90; and SweetMonkTM MV 95. The extracts are mixtures of components found in the Luo Han Guo fruit. E xtracts are similar to those described in GRN 301 (up to 30% mogroside V), GRN 359 (up to 60% mogroside V), and GRN 556 (up to 90 % mogroside V) (FDA, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015a). This GRAS document discusses extracts products containing 7 - 95% mogroside V. These products are similar to the products described in the above mentioned GRNs for which FDA has issued \"no question\" letters. III.C. Name and Address of Responsible Luo Han Guo fruit extracts or S. grosvenori Swingle fruit extracts are mixtures of compounds naturally occurring in the Luo Han Guo fruit. The primary components are cucurbitane glycosides known as mogrosides (II- VI) that are responsible for imparting the characteristic sweet taste. Mogroside V (CAS Reg. No. 88901-36- 4) is the major sweet component of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts. Some of the major sweetening component have CAS numbers Weight: 1287.43. The chemical structure of mo groside V is shown in Figure 1. Other mogrosides also have CAS numbers as follows: Mogroside IV: CAS #89590-95-4 and Mogroside S tructure of mogroside V. 7 000025 SweetMonkTM Table 2 shows a typical compositional analysis of Nutramax's Luo Han Guo fruit extracts (7-95% mogroside V).

Manufacturing Process of Luo Han Guo Fruit Extracts Nutramax's Luo Han Guo fruit extract powders are manufactured in a process similar to that described in previous GRNs. However, N utramax's manufacturing process employs more purification processes to produce highly purified products (Nutramax vs. Food Chemical Codex [FCC]: up to 95% mogroside V vs. 30% mogroside V) under cGMP. Figure 2. Luo Han Guo plant with mature fruit The following outlines the procedures by which Nutramax processes its Luo Han Guo fruit extracts powders: 1) Fresh fruit with the peel intact are selected and weighed. Mature fruits from the Luo Han Guo plant (Figure 2) are inspected upon arrival at the processing plant. D istilled water is used for washing the fresh fruits to remove any impurities . 2) The fruit is then crushed, while preventing crushing the fruit seeds . Then the same weight of distilled water containing enzymes (pectinase) is added and the mixture is incubated at 40 for one day. 3) Distilled water is added ; the mixture is boiled at 100 ; extracted three times, each time for one hour, the third extracts solution is used as the solvent for first extraction of the next batch. 4) The solutions from step 3 are then combined , cooled to room temperature, and subjected to high-speed centrifugation (4,000 rpm for approximately 30 min). To produce 45%, 60%, or 95% of the content, chitosan acetic acid (0.5% in water) is added to precipitate calcium before filtering, followed by the high- speed centrifugation . 5) The centrifugal liqu id is absorbed with resin ( a divinylbenzene copolymer, a macroporous polymeric adsorbent) to remove impurities w ith 20% ethanol. This is then concentrated and dr ied to get product 1 (2% mogroside V). 6) The resin is eluted with 50% ethanol, the eluate solution is then concentrated and dried to get product 2 ( 18-23% mogroside V) and product 3 (24-27% mogroside V). 7) High-speed centrifugation (4,000 rpm for ~30 min) is used after recovering ethanol from the eluate. 8) The mixture is then centrifuged (4, 000 rpm for ~30 min) after macroporous D900 anion exchange resin decolorization . Then concentrat ed dried to get product 4 (40% mogroside V ) and product 5 9 000027 SweetMonkTM 9) The decolorizing resin liquid from step 8) i s further decolorized and purified by macroporous D941 ion exchange resin, and then concentrated and dri ed to get product 6 (50% mogroside V ) and product 7 (60% mogroside V). 10) After decolorizing, a reverse phase silica gel column chromatography (using 20-60% ethanol in water as a gradient mobile phase) is used to get product 8 (90% mogroside V) and product 9 (95% mogroside V). 11) The product s from steps 5-9 are then mixed with the option to specify the product. Luo Han G uo fruit extracts are manufactured under cGMP using common food industry materials and processes in accordance with the applicable parts of 21 CFR, part 1 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations. N utramax uses a HACCP -controlled manufacturing process and rigorously tests its final production batches to verify adherence to quality control specifications. The food grade ethanol used in the purification process complies with FCC's 8th Edition specifications. The ion exchange resins and adsorption resins used in the manufacturing process are food grade and comply with 21 CFR 173.25.

INTENDED USES AND EXPOSURE ESTIMATES IV. A. Intended T echnical Effects Luo Han Guo fruit extracts can be used as a naturally occurring high intensity sweetener. IV.B. Intended U se The subjects of the present GRAS determination contain 7, 12.5, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 55, 60, 90 or 95% mogroside V. Luo Han Guo fruit extracts, containing mogroside V as the principal sweetening c omponent, are intended to be used as a table -top sweetener , a general purpose non- nutritive sweetener , and a flavor modifier in various foods, for which standards of identity exist, located in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The intended use will be as a non-nutritive sweetener as defined in 21 CFR 170.3(o)(19). The intended use levels will vary by food category, but the actual levels are self-limiting due to organoleptic characteristics. The amounts of purified Luo Han Guo fruit extracts to be added to foods will not exceed the amounts reasonably required to accomplish its intended technical effect in foods as required by FDA regulation ( 21 CFR 182.1(b)(1)). Nutramax does not intend to use Luo Han Guo fruit extracts as a component of infant formula or in foods under the USDA's jurisdiction such as meat, poultry, and egg products. Luo Han Guo fruit extracts are intended for use in the same foods and at levels proportional to those for mogroside V specified in GRN s 301, 359, 522 and 556. IV.B. Estimated Dietary Intakes (EDI s) Under the Intended Use Using the methodology presented in GRN 301 and Renwick (2008), the EDI of Nutramax 's Luo Han Guo fruit extracts have been calculated (Tables 4 -1 to 4-11). The amount of sucrose replaced by an intense sweetener equals the dietary exposure for that sweetener multiplied by its relative sweetness intensity compar ed with sucrose. The EDIs of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts are then calculated by dividing the estimated sucrose equivalent intakes by the relative sweetness of a Luo Han Guo fruit extract at specific concentration s of mogroside V. EDIs for high consumers of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts ranged from 1.6 mg/kg body weight ( BW)/day (product containing 90 (product containing V). The EDIs for high consumers of mogroside V for the general population, diabetic adults, healthy children, and diabetic children are up to 1.53, 2.03, 2.23, and 2.05 mg/kg BW/day, respectively. All predicted EDIs for mogroside V are less than 2.3 mg/kg BW/day, which is equivalent to less than 161 mg per 70 kg adult. Each concentration will be used independently of the others for each application; thus, cumulative exposure is not expected. Based on the totality of science and as discussed belo w, these intake levels are considered safe. In this GRAS assessment, Luo Han Guo fruit extracts are intended to be used as alternatives for the currently marketed Luo Han Guo fruit extract products. Thus, the overall exposure to Luo Han Guo fruit extracts is not expected to increase as a result of the introduction of Nut ramax's Luo Han Guo fruit extract products into the market. As described in Renwick (2008), as well as in GRNs 301 and 359, calculations made in this GRAS assessment likely overestimate the potential intake of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts for the following reasons; 1) there are assumptions present in many of the studies, such as the use of food groups rather than individual food items and brands, 2) calculations have assumed the use of maximum permitted use levels although all foods under the intended uses will not be used at the maximum use levels, and 3) the intense sweetener market is unlikely to be dominated by a single sweetener; the presence of multiple sweeteners is likely to reduce the intakes of individual compounds compared with the data given in this section. Indeed, the market share of Luo Han Guo fruit extract products is very low in the intense- sweetener market. 20 000038 SweetMonkTM Table 4-1.

Current R egulatory S tatus USA The FDA has issued 'no question' letters on four GRAS notifications related to food uses of Luo Han Guo fruit extract concentrates (GRN 301, FDA, 2010; GRN 359, 2015a; GRN 556, FDA 2015b). The GRAS notices are summarized in Table 5. Table 5. Summary of G RAS Notices GRN (year of closure) Mogroside V content, % 90th Pcercentile EDI of mogroside V Intended use Company 301 (2010) 30 2.97 As a sweetener and flavor enhancer in foods, excluding infant formula, meat and poultry products BioVittoria, New Zealand 359 (2011) 25, 45, or 55 2.18 As a sweetener and flavor enhancer in foods, excluding infant formula, meat and poultry product Guilin Layn Natural Ingredients Corp., China 522 (2014) 30, 50, or 60 2.12 As a table -top sweetener and as a sweetener in foods, excluding infant formula, meat , and poultry product GLG Life Tech Corp., Canada 556 (2015a) 12.5, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 55, or 90 2.17 As a table -top sweetener and general purpose non-nutritive sweetener, and as a flavor modifier for use in foods other than infant formula and meat and poultry products Hunan Huacheng Biotech, Inc., China Present notice 7, 12.5, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 55, 60, 90, or 95 2.23 As a table top sweetener and general purpose non-nutritive sweetener and as a flavor modifier in foods, excluding infant formula, meat , and poultry products Nutramax I nc., China EDI=Estimated Dietary Intake. Max. EDI for mogroside V = 90th percentile intakes of mogroside V. In GRN 301 (FDA, 2010), the subject of notification was a concentrate derived from Luo Han Guo fruit extracts (S. grosvenori Swingle) which was sold as PureLo\u00ae brand by BioVittoria (Hamilton, New Zealand). The primary components of the concentrate were mogrosides, with mogroside V constituting more than 30 % of the product. The powdered extracts were intended to be used as a component of sweetener blends that can be added to foods or used as tabletop sweeteners. In GRN 301, the estimated 90th percentile intake of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts (30% mogroside V) was determined as 6.8-9.9 mg/kg BW/day for an extracts 100 times sweeter than sugar and the 90th percentile EDI of the mogroside V (Luo Han Guo concentrate- mogroside In GRN 359 (FDA, 2011), the subject of this GRAS notification was Luo Han Guo fruit extracts containing 25, 45, or 55% mogroside V. The powdered extracts were to be marketed under the trade name Go -Luo by Guilin Layn Natural Ingredients (Guangxi, China). The powdere d extracts were intended to be used as general purpose sweetener s and flavor modifier s in various food products. In GRN 359, the sweetness of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts concentrate (25% mogroside V) was found to be 160 times sweeter than sucrose . The differences in the 24 000042 SweetMonkTM relative sweetness of the products resulted from the refinement of the manufacturing process of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts . The sweetness indices of Nutramax's Luo Han Guo fruit extracts concentrates are similar to those described in GRN 339 and 556. In June, 2014, GLG Life Tech Corporation submitted a GRAS notice (GRN 522) of Luo Han Guo fruit extract powders for use as a general purpose non- nutritive sweetener in various foods other than in infant formulas and in meat and poultry p roducts (Date of closure: December 8 , 2014; FDA 201 4). Extracts are similar to th ose described in GRN 359 (up to 55% mogroside V) and to that described in GRN 301 (up to 30% mogroside V ), but were more purified, containing up to 60% mogroside V. In December, 2014, Hunan Huacheng Biotechnology, Inc., China, submitted a GRAS notice (GRN 556 ) of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts powder for use as a table-top sweetener and general purpose non- nutritive sweetener and as a flavor modifier in various foods other than in infant formulas and in meat and poultry products (date of closure: June 17, 2015; F DA, 2015a ). Extracts are similar to the extracts described in GRN 301, 359, and 522, but were more purified, containing up to 90% mogroside V. In GRN 556, the EDIs for high consumers of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts were up to 12.4 mg/kg BW/day (product containing 12.5% mogroside V). The EDIs for high consumers of mogroside V for the general population, diabetic adults, healthy children, and diabetic children are up to 1.48, 1.97, 2.17, and 1.99 mg/kg BW/day, respectively. All predicted EDIs were less than 2.2 mg/kg BW/day, which is equivalent to less than 175 mg per 70 kg adult. In this GRAS notice, e xtracts are similar to those described in GRN 359 (up to 55% mogroside V), GRN 301 mogroside 522 (up to 60% mogroside V) and GRN 556 (up to 90% mogroside V), but are more purified, containing up to 95% mogroside V. In this GRAS notice, the EDIs of the mogroside V for high consumers are estimated to be up to 2.23 mg/kg BW/day. The FDA did not have questions on the summary of safety concluding that Luo Han Guo fruit extracts intake up to 2.5 mg mogroside V/kg BW /day is safe. The FDA did not question the acceptability and suitability of these studies to establish the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extract concentrates for the proposed food uses. The safety and related information in the above mentioned GRAS notices is her eby incorporated by reference to this independent GRAS determination. The pertinent information is available as two New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) notifications were accepted by FDA with no objection for use of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts as a dietary supplement (FDA, 1996, 1999). 25 000043 SweetMonkTM In 2015, the FDA issued 'Additional Information about High- Intensity Sweeteners Permitted for U se in Food in the United States' (FDA, 2015b). The agency included Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle (Luo Han Guo) fruit extracts (SGFE) in the high- intensity sweeteners and stated that ' High-intensity sweeteners are commonly used as sugar substitutes or sugar alternatives because they are many times sweeter than sugar but contribute only a few to no calories when added to foods. High-intensity sweeteners, like all other ingredients added to food in the United States, must be safe for consumption.' (FDA, 2015b). Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme In March 2012, m onk fruit extract/Luo Han Guo/ SGFE was included on the priority l ist for the 44th session of the Codex Committee on Food Additives, JEFCA Standards Programme held in Hangzhou, China. The questions before the committee included those of safety assessment and establishment of specifications (FAO/WHO, 2012). In March 2014, the 46th session of the JECFA Standards Program/Codex Committee on Food Additives, maintained Luo Han Guo fruit extracts on the priority list of substances proposed for evaluation, as proposed by the U.S. (FAO/WHO , 2014). Health Canada On March 14, 2013, Health Canada proposed adding monk fruit extracts to the List of Permitted Sweeteners. Monk fruit was added to Health Canada's List of Permitted Sweeteners on December 2, 2013 as Item M.4. Monk fruit extracts or Luo Han Guo fruit extracts was authorized for use in Canada as a table -top sweetener at a maximum use level of 0.8% calculated as mogroside V (Health Canada, 2013). V.B. Review of Safety Data As noted above, the FDA ha s issued 'no question' letters on four GRAS notices related to food uses of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts. As the Luo Han Guo fruit extracts in this GRAS determination are similar in specif ications compared to the other Luo Han Guo fruit extracts in the FDA GRAS notices, it is recognized that the information and data in the other GRAS notices are pertinent to the safety of the Luo Han Guo fruit extracts in this GRAS determination. Therefore, this notice incorporates by reference the safety and metabolism studies discussed in previous GRNs. Additionally, t his notice discusses an additional animal stud y that has been published since the FDA' s last reviews of 201 5. The subject of the present GRAS assessment is Luo Han Guo fruit extracts (powder form). V.B.1. Metabolism of L uo Han G uo Fruit E xtracts Since the FDA's last completed review in 2015, one animal metabolism study of mogroside V has been published. Thus, this GRAS notice includes this additional metabolism study in animals. Murata et al. (2010) examined the metabolism of mogroside V in 10 week old Wistar rats (4-6 rats per group). The rats were given free access to a standard pellet diet and water. After 16 hours of fasting, they were orally administered 1 ml of Siraitia grosvenori (Swingle) glycoside (SG-gly containing 72% mogroside V, 117 mg/ml) powder in solution. After 2 hours, the contents of the small intestine and portal blood were collected. After 24 hours, feces were collected. The distributions of mogroside V and i ts metabolites were analyzed in the small intestine, portal blood, and whole blood after a single ingestion of SG-gly. When administered to rats, mogroside V was mostly degraded by digestive enzymes and intestinal microflora, and was excreted in the feces as mogrol (aglycone) and its mono- and diglucosides. The amount of mogr osides found in the feces was equivalent to 61% of the administered mogroside V, and no SG triterpenoids were found excreted in the urine. Most of the orally ingested mogroside V is excreted without absorption. As no SG triterpenoids were detected in whole blood, the absorbed amount of SG-gly and its metabolites was very low. Trace amounts of mogrol and its monoglucoside were found in the portal blood as sulfates and/or glucuronide conju gates. 26 000044 SweetMonkTM A study by Xu et al. (2015) confirmed the previous finding (Murata et al., 2010) that most of mogroside metabolites are excreted in feces. The total peak area of mogroside V metabolites in f eces was 182 times higher than that of urine suggesting tha t the metabolite . However, the peak area of mogroside V in f eces was only approximately 0.13% of that of urine (29747017), implying that mogroside V was mainly excreted in the urine. Taken together, it appears that most of the orally administered mogroside V is excreted without absorption. V.B.2. Mutagenicity and Genotoxicity S tudies Since the FDA's last review in 2015, no new mutagenicity studies have been published. Thus, this GRAS notice summarizes the studies already reviewed in previous GRAS notices. In the previous GRAS notices to the FDA, the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts has been established in mutagenicity and genotoxicity studie s. As described in GRN 359, an Ames test (Ames et al., 1975) was conducted at Huntingdon Life Sciences ( 2009a; HLS Study No. HUD0D72) to assess Luo Han Guo fruit extract for its ability to cause point mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 as well as in Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. Five concentrations separated by approximately half-log 10 intervals were tested, with a maximum of 5,000 g of mogroside V per plate with and without S9 activation. In addition to the test article, strains were assayed with an aqueous negative control and with positive controls. No cytotoxic activity was observed at the concentrations tested. There were no substantial increases in revertant colony numbers over aqueous control counts at any concentration tested, with or without S9 mix. Under those test conditions, Luo Han Guo fruit extract did not exhibit any cytotoxic or mutagenic potential. V.B.3. Animal Toxicity S tudies Since the FDA's last completed review of 2015, no new animal toxicity studies have been published. Thus, this GRAS notice summarizes the studies already reviewed in previous GRAS notices. The notified substances in this notice are Luo Han Guo fruit extracts at varying concentrations of mogroside V, thus, it included the safety studies of mogroside V as the basis of discussing the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extract . Results of animal toxicity studies are summarized in Table 6 . Overall, studies found that the LD 50 for an aqueous extract of S. grosvenori fruit and mogrosides are over 10 g/kg BW in mice (Lee, 1975). A compound that has a LD 50 value over 5 g/kg BW in rodents is classified as 'practically nontoxic', and a compound with a LD 50 value over 15 g/kg BW as 'relatively harmless' (Altug, 2003). According to this, Luo Han Guo fruit extract and mogrosides belong to the group with the lowest toxicity rating. 27 000045 SweetMonkTM Table 6.

BW=body weight. A subacute study in rats found that the no observed adverse effect levels ( NOAELs ) for Luo Han Guo fruit extract mg/kg BW /day in males and 7,480 mg/kg/day in females and those for mogroside V were approximately 2,310 mg /kg BW/day in males and 2,244 mg/kg et al., 2008). 28 000046 SweetMonkTM Subchronic studies reported that NOAEL s for Luo Han Guo fruit extract were over 3,120 mg/kg BW/day and 3,750 mg/kg BW/day in male and female rats, respectively, and those of mogroside V were over 1,717 and 2,062 mg/kg BW/day in male and female rats, respectively (Huntingdon Life Science, 2009b). V.B.3.1.Acute toxicity The first reported acute toxicity testing of a Luo Han Guo fruit extract was conducted by Lee (1975). Luo Han Guo fruit extract was administered to male albino mice (10 mice/group) at doses up to 15 g/kg BW for 1 week. Although t he mice transiently exhibited mild sedation and diarrhea at the dose of 15 g/kg BW , they appeared normal within 30 -60 minutes. No mortalities were observed . The author reported the LD 50 of Luo Han Guo fruit extract to be in excess of 10 g/kg BW in mice. In an acute toxicity study in mice conducted by Makapugay et al. (1985) , mogroside V isolated from a water- soluble Luo Han Guo fruit extract resulted in no mortality at doses up to 2 g/kg BW. The authors reported the LD50 to be greater than 2 g/kg BW and that the extract was not mutagenic. Hussain et al. (1990) performed acute toxicity experiments of a Luo Han Guo fruit extract in male Swiss - Webster mice, ages 4 -6 weeks. A single oral administration of Luo Han Guo fruit extract in 1% aqueous sodium carboxymethylcellulose was administered at doses of 1 or 2 g/kg BW. Animals were observed for toxicity and changes in body weight for 14 days. The authors reported that administration of Luo Han Guo fruit extract at doses up to 2 g/kg BW did not reveal changes in body weights or signs of toxicity. The LD 50 was thus reported to be greater than 2 g/kg BW , the highest dose tested . V.B.3.2. Subacute T oxicity To test the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extract powder (30% mogroside V) , Qin et al. (2006) performed a 28 day oral study in dogs. Three dogs of each sex were assigned to 0 or 3,000 mg/kg BW/day. Administration of Luo Han Guo fruit extract did results in any adverse effects in measured clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, gross necropsy, organ weight, or histopathology. The NOAEL for Luo Han Guo fruit extract powder was determined to be 3,000 mg/kg BW /day (or 9 00 mg /kg BW/day for mogroside V) in dogs. Marone et al. (2008) examined the toxicity of Luo Han Guo fruit extract powder (30% mogroside V) in Hsd:Sprague Sawley ( SD) rats in a 28 day study. Groups of 20 rats (10/sex/group) were fed diets containing 0, 1, 3, or 10% of Luo Han Guo fruit extract powder. Luo Han Guo fruit extract powder was well tolerated and produced no significant adverse effects. Statistically signific ant changes were found in clinical chemistry (decreased bilirubin, increased total protein) and relative organ weights of the liver, adrenals, ovaries, testes, and epididymides were not correlated with any histopathological findings and not considered adve rse. While a few clinical and pathological findings suggested potential treatment- related effects, these findings were transient, inconsistent, non- adverse, not dose -dependent, and not supported by histopathological findings. The NOAEL was concluded to be 10.0% in the diet for Luo Han Guo fruit extract (30% mogroside V), which is equivalent to 7,070 mg/kg BW/day in males and 7,480 mg/kg BW/day in females. Based on these findings, the NOAEL for mogroside V could be 2,310 mg /kg 2,244 mg/kg BW/day in females. V.B.3.3. Subchronic Toxicity Studies Jin et al. (2007) tested the toxicity of Luo Han Guo fruit extract (mogroside V content, not specified) with a 13- week repeated dose study performed on Wistar Hannover rats. Male and female rats were divided into five groups with eight rats each and given a diet consisting of 0%, 0.04%, 0.2%, 1%, or 5% Luo Han Guo fruit extract for 13 weeks. No deaths were observed and there were no significant changes reported in general appearance, body weight, food and water consumption, hematological and serum biochemic al parameters, organ 29 000047 SweetMonkTM weight, or histopathological findings between control and test groups. During the experimental period, an increasing or decreasing tendency of food and water consumption was sometimes observed in females of the 0.2-5% groups and males of the 5% group, as compared with the corresponding control group. However, these changes appeared to be attributable to the fact that some of the animals in these groups spilled food and water from the feeders and water bottles. In addition, there were no significant changes in body weight gain in these treated groups. Thus, these fluctuations are not considered to be due to the treatment of S. grosvenori extract. In hematological examinations, a significant increase in the ratio of stab cells and m onocytes was observed in males of the 1% and 5% groups. However, the changes were very small in their fluctuation range, and there were no remarkable changes in the total count of white blood cells in any of the treated groups. Therefore, these findings were not regarded as a treatment -related change. In serum biochemical examinations, a significant increase in total cholesterol level (62.0 \u00b1 10.9 mg/dl) was observed in females of the 5% group. However, the values were very close to the normal range of the historical background data (62.7 \u00b1 9.4 mg/dl) of Wistar Hannover rats. In addition, the serum biochemistry showed a significant decrease in inorganic phosphate in females of the 5% group. However, the serum level of inorganic phosphate in the 5% group (4.7 \u00b1 0.4 mg/dl) was very close to the normal range of historical data (4.6 \u00b1 0.5 mg/dl). Therefore, these fluctuations are considered to be of no toxicological significance. The authors concluded that there were no toxic changes related to the administration of S. grosvenori extract in rats given 5% of diet and that the NOAEL (no -observed- adverse effect level) of this extracts in Wistar Hannover rats was estimated to be 5% (corresponding to 2,520 mg/kg/day in males and 3,200 mg/kg/day in females) or more. The authors indicated that S. grosvenori extract would not induce any serious toxic changes to consumers by the ingestion of this extracts via food. To test the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extract containing 30% mogroside V, Qin et al. (2006) performed a 90- day oral study in dogs. Three dogs of each sex were assigned to 0 or 3,000 mg/kg BW/ day. The Luo Han Guo fruit extract was well tolerated and did not produce any general organ or systemic toxi city when fed via gavage to male and female dogs at a dose of 3,000 mg/kg BW /day over a period of 90 days. There were no significant effects on clinical signs or organ weights and no histological changes considered to be related to treatment. There were no consistent, adverse, or clinically relevant changes in hematology, clinical biochemistry, or urinalysis parameters at 90-day terminal time points. The authors concluded that t he NOAEL s were 3,000 mg/kg BW/day for Luo Han Guo fruit extracts or 900 mg/kg BW /day for mogroside V. Hirose (1999) a dministered a Luo Han Guo fruit extract containing 30% mogroside V to rats in the form of a reddish brown solid paste dissolved in tap water. Five groups of ten male and ten female 6- week old rats were given access to drinking water that contained Luo Han Guo fruit extract at concentrations of 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0%, or 2.0% for 90 days. The amount of water ingested and the body weights of the animals were recorded to calculate dose levels. No significant differences were attributable to the test material during the experiment, and no significant changes in water intake, body weights or internal organs, biochemical s erum values (serum total protein, glyceri des), serum mineral content, hematology or histopathological findings were found when the test groups were compared to the control. In GRN 359 , a 90-day oral rat toxicity study of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts containing 55% mogroside V was described (Huntingdon Life Science, 2009b). Four groups each of 20 male and 20 female Crl:CD \u00ae (SD) IGS BR rats were fed either 0 (control), 1 .25, 2.5, or 5% of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts containing 55% mogroside V for 90 days. No treatment-related mortality was observed and no significant differences in body weights or food consumption during the dosing and recovery periods were reported. There were no significant effects in hematology, serum chemistry findings, or histopathological observations in any tissue samples or organs. Therefore, the NOAEL for Luo Han Guo fruit extracts powder was consid ered to be a dietary concentration of 5% (corresponding 3,120 mg/kg BW/day in males and 3,750 mg/kg BW/day in female rats ), the highest dose tested. Corresponding NOAEL s for mogroside V were determin ed to be 1,717 and 2,062 mg/kg BW/day in male and female rats, respectively. 30 000048 SweetMonkTM V.B.4. Animal Efficacy Studies Since the FDA's last completed review in 2015, no new animal efficacy studies have been published. Thus, this GRAS notice summarizes the studies already reviewed in previous GRAS notices. Di et al. (2011) assessed the anti -inflammatory properties of mogrosides in a murine ear edema model. Results showed that mogrosides inhibit ed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate-induced and PPAR gene expression. Shi et al. (2014) reported protective effects and mechanisms of mogroside V on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice. Female BALB/c mice were treated with commercial mogroside V (2.5, 5 , and 10 mg/kg) for 1 h prior to intranasal injection of lipopolysaccharide (10 g in 50 l). After 12 h, airway inflammation in the acute lung injury model was determined by the wet/dry weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity of lung tissue, leukocyte recrui and cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid . Additionally, lung tissue was examined by histology and western blotting to investigate the changes in pathology and the signaling in the presence and absence of mogroside V. Mogroside V at 5 and 10 mg/kg BW inhibited airway inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide as measured by the decrease in the histological changes (44 and 67.3% reduction in lung injury score, respectively), a 28.9 and 55.3% reduction in lung myeloperoxidase activity, and inflammatory cell counts, interleukin -1 (IL-1, 382 and 280 pg/ml, respectively), IL -6 (378 and 232 pg/ml, respectively), and tumor necrosis factor - (TNF-, 12.5 and 7.8 ng/ml, respectively) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Additionally, mogroside V treatment reduced the activation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), iNOS, and the nuclear factor (NF)-B. The authors suggest that mogroside V has the potential to protect against lipopolysaccharide-induced airway inflammation in a model of acute lung i njury. Wang et al. (2014) reported that cucurbitane glycosides derived from mogroside IIE, a bitter triterpenoid saponin which is the main component of unripe Luo Han Guo fruit and a precursor of mogroside V, have antioxidant activity. V.B.5 . Human Clinical Studies Since the FDA's last completed review in 2015, no new human clinical studies have been published. Thus, this GRAS notice summarizes the studies already reviewed in previous GRAS notices (Table 7). Two unpublished clinical studies (Xu et al ., 2005a and 2005b) with Luo Han Guo fruit extracts were reported in GRN 301. Xu et al. (2005a) assessed the comparative effect of consumption of Luo Han fruit concentrate containing 30% mogroside V on blood glucose concentration in a crossover design . After fasting overnight, 5 healthy men and 5 healthy women aged 19-25 years consumed 200 mg/kg BW of the Luo Han Guo fruit extract concentrate (30% mogroside V) dissolved in water. Their blood glucose levels were tested at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minut es after dosing. Ingestion of Luo Han Guo fruit extract concentrate had no effect on blood glucose. No adverse effects of Luo Han Guo fruit extract were reported. Xu et al. (2005b) used a similar crossover design to assess the effect of Luo Han Guo fruit e xtract concentrate containing 30% mogroside V and that of water on blood levels of liver enzymes. Six healthy males aged 19-25 years fasted overnight and then consumed 200 mg/kg BW of Luo Han Guo fruit extract concentrate dissolved in water. Three days later they consumed only water. On both days, blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours after administration and no significant changes were observed in 5 adverse effects of Luo Han Guo fruit extract were reported. 31 000049 SweetMonkTM Table 7.

SAFETY DETERMINATION Numerous human and animal studies have reported benefits of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts with varying concentrations of mogroside V with no major adverse effects . Nutramax uses a HACCP -controlled manufacturing process and rigorously tests its final production batches to verify adherence to quality control specifications. There is broad -based and widely disseminated knowledge concerning the chemistry of mogroside V, a major active component of Lou Han Guo fruit extract. This GRAS determination is based on the data and information generally available and consented opinion about the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extract. The literature indicates that Luo Han Guo fruit extracts offers consumers benefits without adverse effects. The following safety evaluation fully considers the composition, intake, nutritional, microbiological, and toxicological properties of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts as well as appropriate corroborative data. 1. Nutramax's Luo Han Guo fruit extracts concentrates (powder form) are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) using common food industry materials and processes. 2. Analytical data from multiple lots indicate that the Luo Han Guo fruit extracts powders comply reliably with the established food-grade product specifications and meet all applicable purity standards. 3. Nutramax 's Luo Han G uo fruit extracts will be used as a table- top sweetener and as a general purpose non-nutritive sweetener or a flavor modifier in various foods other than in infant formulas and in meat and poultry products. Intended use is the same as that was described in GRN s 301, 359, 522 and 556. Due to the characteristic intense sweet flavor of the fruit and its derivatives, use is expected to be self - limiting. 4. The exposure estimates, estimated dietary intakes (EDI), under the i ntended use are estimated to be up to 2.2 mg mogroside V/kg BW/day for high consumers. The EDIs for Luo Han Guo fruit extracts ranged from 1.6 to 22 mg/kg BW/day, depending on the concentration of mogroside V in each Luo Han Guo fruit extracts product. These levels are far below the reference dose safe for human exposure. In addition, subchronic studies reported that NOAEL s for Luo Han Guo fruit extracts were over 3,120 mg/kg BW/day and 3,750 mg/kg BW/day in male and female rats, respectively, and those of mogroside V were over 1,717 and 2,062 mg/kg BW/day, respectively . 5. The EDI estimates are based on the assumption that Nutramax's Luo Han Guo fruit extracts will replace currently marketed Luo Han Guo fruit extract. Thus, cumulative exposures are not expected. In addition, the EDIs presented in this notice are highly optimistic estimates. 6. In the previous GRAS notices (GRNs 301, 359, 522 and 556) to the FDA, the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts had been established in toxicological studies in animals, mutagenicity studies, and is further supported by clinical studies in humans. The FDA responses to GRAS notifications on Luo Han Guo fruit extracts indicate that the FDA is satisfied with the safety -in-use of the Luo Han Guo fruit extract, as long as consumption is 2.5 mg mogroside V/kg BW/day. Furthermore, historical consumption of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts support the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extract . 7. Additional animal studies published subsequent to the FDA GRAS notices continue to support the safety of Luo Han Guo fruit extracts as a food ingredient. 33 000051 __________________________________________ __________________ __________________________________________ ___________________ __________________________________________ ___________________ SweetMonkTM VII.
