[emulsifying](/ingredient-functions/emulsifying), [surfactant/cleansing](/ingredient-functions/surfactant-cleansing) A mildly viscous, amber-colored liquid with fatty odor, made from Castor Oil and polyethylene glycol (PEG). If it were a person, we'd say, it's agile, diligent & multifunctional. It's mostly used as an emulsifier and surfactant but most often it is used to [juice containing leaves of the Aloe vera plant](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/aloe-barbadensis-leaf-juice).

It's pretty much the current IT-preservative. It's safe and gentle, but even more importantly, it's not a feared-by-everyone-mostly-without-scientific-reason paraben. It's not something new: it was introduced around 1950 and today it can be used up to 1% worldwide. It can be found in nature - in green tea - but the version used in cosmetics is synthetic. Other than having a good safety profile and being quite gentle to the skin it has some other advantages too. It can be used in many types of formulations as it has great thermal stability (can be heated up to 85\u00b0C) and works on a wide range of pH levels (ph 3-10). It's often used together with ethylhexylglycerin as it nicely improves the preservative activity of phenoxyethanol. We don't have description for this ingredient yet. [preservative](/ingredient-functions/preservative)| Irritancy: 0 | Comedogenicity: 0 The most common type of feared-by-everyone-mostly-without-scientific-reason [parabens](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parabens). It's a cheap, effective and well-tolerated ingredient to make sure the cosmetic formula does not go wrong too soon. Apart from the general controversy around parabens (we wrote about it more [here](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parabens)), there is a 2006 in-vitro (made in the lab not on real people) research about methylparaben (MP) showing that when exposed to sunlight, MP treated skin cells suffered more harm than non-MP treated skin cells. The study was not done with real people on real skin but still - using a good sunscreen next to MP containing products is a good idea. (Well, in fact using a sunscreen is always a good idea. :)) [Fragrance](/ingredients/parfum)- icky [perfuming](/ingredient-functions/perfuming) Exactly what it sounds: nice smelling stuff put into cosmetic products so that the end product also smells nice. Fragrance in the US and parfum in the EU is a generic term on the ingredient list that is made up of 30 to 50 chemicals on average (but it can have as much as 200 components!). If you are someone who likes to know what you put on your face then fragrance is not your best friend - there's no way to know what's really in it. Also, if your skin is sensitive, fragrance is again not your best friend. It's the number one cause of contact allergy to cosmetics. It's definitely a smart thing to avoid with sensitive skin (and fragrance of any type - natural is just as allergic as synthetic, if not worse!). [preservative](/ingredient-functions/preservative), [perfuming](/ingredient-functions/perfuming)| Irritancy: 0 | Comedogenicity: 0 A very common type of feared-by-everyone-mostly-without-scientific-reason [parabens](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parabens). It's a cheap, effective and well-tolerated ingredient to make sure the cosmetic formula does not go wrong too soon. It's one of those things that help your cosmetics not to go wrong too soon, aka a preservative. It's not a strong one and doesn't really work against bacteria, but more against mold and yeast. To do that it has to break down to its active form, sorbic acid. For that to happen, there has to be water in the product and the right pH value (pH 3-4). But even if everything is right, it's not enough on its own. If you see potassium sorbate you should see some other preservative next to it too. BTW, it's also a food preservative and even has an E number, E202. A helper ingredient that helps to make the products stay nice longer, aka preservative. It works mainly against fungi. It's pH dependent and works best at acidic pH levels (3-5). It's not strong enough to be used in itself so it's always combined with something else, often with [potassium sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate). [solvent](/ingredient-functions/solvent) Good old water, aka H2O. The most common skincare ingredient of all. You can usually find it right in the very first spot of the ingredient list, meaning it's the biggest thing out of all the stuff that makes up the product. It's mainly a solvent for ingredients that do not like to dissolve in oils but rather in water. Once inside the skin, it hydrates, but not from the outside - putting pure water on the skin (hello long baths!) is drying. One more thing: the water used in cosmetics is purified and deionized (it means that almost all of the mineral ions inside it is removed). Like this, the products can stay more stable over time.
