Over six months after the Centre notified a Central Drug Laboratory (cdl) at Hyderabad, the vaccine testing laboratory has been set up at the National Institute of Animal Biotechnology (NIAB) at Gachibowli. However, it is yet to get the authorisation to begin testing and clearance of vaccine batches for release in the market. Not a single batch of Covid vaccine has failed the safety, quality and efficacy test so far, even as India has rapidly expanded its manufacturing capacities over the last 11 months since January to cater to local and global demand for jabs. The country's apex vaccine testing facility \u2014 Central Drug Laboratory (cdl) in Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh \u2014 has tested over 1,114 batches of Covid jabs between January till October. So far, a total of 45.7 crore doses have been supplied to the states and UTs since January. Besides, an additional around 6 crore doses are expected to be supplied by 31st July. This will amount to a total of 51.7 crore doses supplied so far.
