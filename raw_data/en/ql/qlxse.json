Just as other muscles of the body can become tightened, stressed and imbalanced from overwork, the muscles of the pelvic floor also become imbalanced from stress, illness or trauma. Holistic Pelvic CareTM combines traditional physical medicine practices of addressing pelvic floor imbalance through gentle, intravaginal massage along with breathwork, education, visualization, lifestyle changes and body awareness exercises. These integrative techniques help create connection to this part of the body that we often disconnect from. Specific concerns addressed by Holistic Pelvic Care include (but are not limited to): - Urinary leakage or incontinence Chronic bladder or vaginal infections - Uterine prolapse Pelvic pain - Painful sexual activity, intercourse or sexual dysfunction - Fertility support and pregnancy preparation - Healing after miscarriage, pregnancy loss or abortion - Postpartum concerns and recovery - Menstrual pain - Pelvic congestion, heaviness or instability - Pelvic muscle weakness Menopausal concerns History of pelvic trauma or abuse What Are The Benefits? - Relief from painful symptoms Increased blood flow and sensation - Reduced tension and trigger points in pelvic muscles Increased strength in pelvic muscles - Improved sexual function - Feeling more relaxed and centred - A sense of connection to the rhythms and cycles of the female body Feeling empowered with pelvic knowledge and self-care What to Expect The first appointment is typically the longest and includes a medical history and discussion of your goals for treatment. We will also review female pelvic anatomy and muscles with a 3D model and will address any questions or concerns you may have. We will start with basic external work and, if you are comfortable, we may move on to internal work. Internal work is manual therapy where your provider inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the vaginal canal. A woman's pelvic muscles will be assessed for tone and strength as well as any areas of tension or trigger points. The assessment is followed by treatment using techniques such as gentle massage and trigger point release as well as breath work and visualization tools. Follow-up appointments are typically shorter once the initial goals have been determined. In addition to... - Cervical dysplasia (abnormal PAP) treatment, including escharotic treatment Ready to Get Started? Schedule an appointment today or book in a free 15 minute consultation. [BOOK "}
