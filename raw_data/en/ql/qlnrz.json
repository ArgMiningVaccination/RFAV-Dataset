A 2010 Forbes study revealed development costs ranging from $4 billion to about $11 billion per drug. With such a large price tag, the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most high-risk industries in the world. What factors influenced the strategic decision making behind this deal? And how does its strategy ensure the low risk? 1. Threat of New Entrants: By channeling resources and investments to dominate a particular segment within a company's portfolio, not only is each company strengthening their own reputation and pipeline, but they are directly influencing the barriers to entry. The asset-swap of the three-part deal allowed for each company to segment a portion of their portfolio and invest R&D resources to a specific unit. For Novartis, for example, this was done by acquiring the oncology unit from GSK, strengthening their already stellar oncological pursuits. The deal is considered by economists to be low-risk because of the concentration of specific segments within each respective portfolio. \"...it has an extremely valuable role to play if you can find targeted transactions which allow you to strengthen in the places where you have long-term competitive advantage.\" - Andrew Witty, CEO of GlaxoSmithKline RECOMMENDATIONS Social consciousness: Within the past decade, all three companies have been subject to lawsuits, from fraud to sexual discrimination to failure to report safety data. From a buyer's perspective, it would have been beneficial to utilize the deal, leverage its publicity and ultimate goals for the future and to revamp the companies' individual reputation in connection with their respective lawsuits. While the bargaining power of the buyer may not have played a crucial role in the strategic decision making behind the GSK/Lilly/Novartis deal, it may have impacted the companies better in the long-term, especially since each of the companies are now, more than ever, susceptible to criticism from any one consumer with access to the internet.
