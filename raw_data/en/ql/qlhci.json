He is chairman of the department of molecular medicine and vice chairman for research at the department of surgery of the Zucker School of Medicine. He also serves as head of the Center for Immunology & Inflammation at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research. In 2002, Dr. Wang became a professor of surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and chief of the division of surgical research at North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center. Previously, Dr. Wang held positions of professor of surgery (with tenure) and professor of pathology, physiology and biophysics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, as well as associate professor in the department of surgery at Brown University School of Medicine and Rhode Island Hospital. Dr. Wang is a member of various surgical and biomedical societies. He served as president of the Shock Society (2016-2017) and as program chair at the 2013 Annual Conference on Shock. Dr. Wang currently serves as editorial board member for several biomedical journals and as guest reviewer for many high-impact journals. He has served as a member of various National Institutes of Health (NIH) Study Sections and Veterans Affairs Surgery Study Sections. Dr. Wang holds 15 patents and is a co-founder of TheraSource LLC, a biotech company. Dr. Wang has published over 475 articles in peer-reviewed journals. His seminal discovery that extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is a novel endogenous proinflammatory molecule was published in Nature Medicine. In 1995, Dr. Wang received the NIH 5-year FIRST (R29) Award and Independent Scientist Award (K02). He has been continuously funded by NIH for the last 28 years. He was awarded the Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) (R35) grant from the NIH in 2016. His research is currently funded by five NIH grants (an R35, two U01s, and two R01s). Dr. Wang received the prestigious Distinguished Service Award and the Scientific Achievement Award from the Shock Society, and he is a member of Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) Honor Medical Society. The Center for Immunology & Inflammation originated from the Laboratory of Surgical Research, which Dr. Wang established in 2002. Since then, the center has grown extensively and currently includes more than 25 members ranging from PhD students to professor-level faculty members. Dr. Wang has been a mentor for many faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, surgical residents and graduate students. Many scientists and postdoctoral fellows from the center received local, regional and national awards recognizing the merits of their research such as the New Investigator Award and Travel Awards from the Shock Society, and the Annual Scientific Award from the Society of Critical Care Medicine. The Center for Immunology & Inflammation's long-term goal is to understand the pathobiological mechanisms contributing to organ dysfunction and to develop better therapies for inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury and shock. A strong research focus of the center is the role of extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) in health and disease. We have discovered that eCIRP acts as a new damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) to exaggerate inflammation and organ injury in sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. Early during inflammation, immune cells such as macrophages release eCIRP, which amplifies inflammation and promotes organ dysfunction by activating surface receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1), or interleukin-6 receptor alpha (IL-6R). We have also developed C23 and M3, two novel small peptides that act as competitive inhibitors of eCIRP's binding to its receptors. C23 antagonizes the interactions of eCIRP with TLR4 and M3 antagonizes the interaction of eCIRP with TREM-1. Both compounds show beneficial effects in preclinical models of sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and hemorrhagic shock. Our team also discovered an endogenous inhibitor of eCIRP, an engineered miRNA PS-OMe miR130 that ameliorates preclinical models of sepsis. In addition, we have identified eCIRP's contribution to immunosuppression or immune paralysis in T-cells and macrophages. We also identified that eCIRP plays a critical role in cognition by demonstrating that alcohol intoxication causes eCIRP to be released into the brain, leading to cognitive impairment. This finding has inspired us to evaluate eCIRP's role in progressive neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Another line of research at the center involves neutrophils in sepsis. While neutrophil effector molecules may neutralize infection, uncontrolled release of these effectors often cause tissue damage. We have recently identified the eCIRP's role in generating novel neutrophils produce elevated levels of NETs, ROS, and iNOS to cause inflammation and acute lung injury in sepsis. eCIRP can directly induce NET formation through a novel ICAM-1-Rho-mediated pathway in the lungs during sepsis. Our research on eCIRP, neutrophils, and NETs have elucidated novel mechanisms of disease in sepsis and reveal new potential therapeutic avenues for patients with sepsis and related inflammatory diseases. An additional research interest is the clearance of dying cells by phagocytosis (also known as efferocytosis) and its effects on inflammation. We have shown that eCIRP impairs the clearance of apoptotic cells and bacteria by professional phagocytes. This defect appears to be mediated by eCIRP-induced NETs and eCIRP-induced changes in actin polymerization. Our recent research on phagocytosis is associated with our prior work with milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) which markedly attenuates disease severity in preclinical models of sepsis, I/R injury, and hemorrhagic shock by accelerating the clearance of dying cells by the macrophages. We also conduct research to better understand how to minimize the endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction that contributes to lung and intestinal injury during inflammatory diseases such as sepsis and radiation injury. We have shown that eCIRP reduces the expression of tight junction proteins, which are important in preventing the leakage of proteins through the intercellular spaces between ECs in the lungs. We recently discovered that eCIRP causes dysregulation of macrophage bacterial phagocytosis in sepsis. Since eCIRP is elevated in radiation injury, we are now studying eCIRP's role in the innate immune dysfunction associated with radiation-sepsis combined injury. In addition to eCIRP and MFG-E8, we have also evaluated the role of several other molecules in the pathobiology of inflammation. For example, we have investigated ghrelin, a stomach-derived peptide which is reduced and implicated with organ injury in inflammation. Downregulation of ghrelin activates sympatho-stimulatory nuclei in the brain, increasing norepinephrine release from the sympathetic nerve fibers in the gut, resulting in upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent injuries to the liver and other organs (the brain-gut-liver axis paradigm). Treatment of animals with ghrelin reduces organ injury in renal ischemia-reperfusion, radiation combined injury and stroke. Our ultimate goal is to develop novel therapeutics by better understanding the mechanisms responsible for organ dysfunction in inflammatory diseases, identifying novel mediators, and pursuing translational research.
