We typically think of stress as a situation or event, but stress is deeper than an emotional state. Daily stressors include things like undernourishment, over exercising, poor quality food and water, environmental toxins, etc. Which is why these 8 simple swaps can make a positive impact on hormone balance! Swap intermittent fasting for a nourishing breakfast When we wake up we are in a depleted state and the liver is running low on glycogen (energy). If we do not eat and nourish ourselves within an hour of waking, our body goes into \"survival state\" which effects the balance of cortisol, adrenaline, estrogen, and progesterone along with other hormones. Swap alcohol for mocktails/ mineral rich drinks It's no secret that alcohol is destructive to the gut and liver, and both are vital organs for hormone function. Instead, try mineral rich drinks that help balance metabolism and hormones. This includes things like adrenal cocktails, bone broth, electrolytes, etc. Swap coffee on an empty stomach for coffee after breakfast This one is along the same lines as intermittent fasting but coffee exacerbates problems in a depleted state. Coffee is metabolically stimulating and if the energy is not there to support it, all metabolic functions including hormone balance will suffer. Swap PUFAs for saturated fats Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) like canola, safflower, sunflower, soybean, and certain vegetable oils are highly processed. Reducing these will reduce inflammatory oxidative damage on the body, especially the reproductive system. Read labels, these oils are in so many packaged foods. Look for and use coconut oil, olive oil, avocado oil, butter, ghee, tallow, and lard instead. Swap cardio and HIIT for exercising with your cycle Cardio and high intensity interval training is NOT bad but when we're talking about hormone health, it is not always the best option. Be mindful of where you're at in your cycle, do movement and exercise in alignment with your hormones and energy reserves.

Swap chemical filled tampons with organic cotton products Non-organic tampons can contain pesticides and other chemicals that are damaging to the body. The vagina is highly absorbent which is why switching to organic cotton tampons or pads will have a positive impact on your hormone health. You can even get organic cotton period underwear if you are looking for a reusable, non-toxic option. Swap chemical cleaners for non-toxic alternatives Endocrine (hormone) disrupters are chemicals known to be in many cleaning products. Even though it's not directly on your body it still affects the air quality in your home. Keep it simple when it comes to products and find brands that don't contain bleach, ammonia, fragrance, and hazardous labels. Swap toxic beauty products for non-toxic brands Everything we put on our body can get into the bloodstream through our skin so it's important to be mindful of the products we use everyday. Find swaps that don't contain fragrances, heavy metals, and "}
