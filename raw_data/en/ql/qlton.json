PBV are small linear peptide fragments containing T cell epitopes which are designed to reduce the ability to cross link antigen-specific IgE.

The mechanisms underlying the efficacy of PBV appear to be similar to those described for classical immunological tolerance. Thus, the peptides may induce anergy due to absence of co-stimulation, activationinduced cell death, a switch from a Th2 to a Th1 cytokine profile, the induction of regulatory T cells or combinations of these mechanisms. Successful immunotherapy, in bee sensitive individuals, is associated with the elaboration of IL-10.
