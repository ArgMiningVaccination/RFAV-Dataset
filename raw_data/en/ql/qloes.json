What does it mean to be truly healed at the core? Is healing achieved, when the headaches, or chronic bladder infections, or the allergies are gone? When sleep and appetite return, skin eruptions disappear, or maybe when the stomach ulcer says \"good bye\" forever? Homeopathic practitioners like to achieve improvements for these kinds of conditions and also see the beneficial effects of homeopathy for symptoms that manifest on a deeper level. A simple example how this \"law\" works can be seen in the effects of coffee consumption. Coffee consumed late in the day, may overly excite a sensitive person and prevent a good night's rest. However, the remedy Coffea, a highly diluted homeopathic preparation made from coffee, has helped many people to recover from insomnia. Usually good sleep is a step towards better health, but what if someone is stuck in an emotional problem resulting from a negative life experience, such as grief or a heart breaking disappointment? Or maybe worse, a very frightening experience has lead to anxieties and phobias that make life very difficult to live? And what can be done, if unresolved internal situations have caused conditions such as learning disorders, nightmares, depression, or agoraphobia? While physical improvement is very important, a lesser-known goal of homeopathic treatment lies elsewhere. Healing with homeopathy means that it is essential to restore health on an energetic level first. Based on personal experience and case histories collected for two centuries, homeopaths trust the fact, that once the vitality of a person is established or recovered, the body will trigger an astonishing healing process. A high goal, that intends to lead to improvement on all levels, mentally, emotionally and physically. Homeopathic remedies are used to support the innate healing power (in homeopathic terms Vital Force) in its effort to balance the intricate mind-body connection. \"The highest ideal of cure is the rapid, gentle and permanent restoration of health in the shortest, most reliable and least disadvantageous way, according to clearly realizable principles.\" - Samuel Hahnemann, Founder of Homeopathy, 1810 And how can this be achieved? Homeopathic treatment is based on the Law of Similars or Like Cures Like. This meansthat a substance capable of producing certain symptoms . when given to a healthy person will cure those same. The idea of homeopathic treatment is to change the body chemistry very deeply, to influence cells with an energetic imprint, possibly affecting RNA and DNA levels (see study by French immunologist, Jacques Beneviste, Nature, 1988). Just like a tuning fork triggers a vibration on a piano string, a homeopathic remedy is used to trigger an energetic stimulation to a person's vital force. While acute symptoms are often quickly resolved with homeopathic treatment, balancing energetic disorders in the mental or emotional sphere can require a bit of work. The rewarding prospect of this form of treatment is that deeply lodged psychological conditions can be more than temporarily alleviated. The homeopathic process often solves them. A homeopathic interview starts this process. Homeopathic practitioners really listen, practicing a skill they are trained to do well. An initial consultation usually lasts 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After taking a very comprehensive case history the practitioner strives to understand how the client personally experiences a health concern. In homeopathic treatment no two migraines are considered the same. The goal of a consultation is to recognize each person's unique state of health. \"Homeopathy cures a greater percentage of cases than any other method of treatment\" - Mahatma Gandhi After a thorough review of the consultation, a remedy is selected to match the particular individual's state of health. It is the person's total symptom picture that is treated, not an isolated set of symptoms or a diagnosed condition. How can a homeopathic remedy be \"matched\" to someone's state of health? Sometimes this is not an easy task, but the results often justify the effort. Every homeopathic remedy approved by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the US has undergone a unique style of drug testing. In t he process of creating new homeopathic remedies, highly diluted substances are ingested by healthy and willing individuals until symptoms of the particularsubstance develop. Remedy profiles of these test results (in homeopathic terms Provings ) have been recorded for over 200 years and continue today with numerous provings conducted globally. On the basis of Like Cures Like, a personal profile is then matched to a remedy profile's symptom list, including mental, emotional and physical symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are prepared from mineral, plant and animal substances. Their high dilution renders them absolutely non-toxic. Once a remedy reaches a certain dilution, the healing power of these remedies is then purely energetic. The effect of a homeopathic remedy on the vital force is comparable to the energetic imprint on water molecules as photographed by Masaru Emoto. Recommended reading: . .
