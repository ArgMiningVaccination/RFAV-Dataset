We wonder... are we feeding the right food, are they getting enough exercise, are they in pain, are they happy? We just want our furry friends as happy and healthy as possible. So it makes sense with all the essential oil safety factors that some pet parents just decide not to use essential oils with their animals, especially with cats ... it just doesn't seem worth the risk. [(To learn the facts, check out The Truth About Cats and Essential Oils).](https://amywilliamsdelong.com/the-truth-about-cats-and-essential-oils/) If you're one of those overcautious pet parents (or even if you're not,) I have good news for you. Aromatherapy is more than just essential oils. Hydrosols, herbs, and dried plants are other forms of aromatics that are safe and effective. They don't have all the safety factors essential oils have (so, no more worries). Anyone can use them, but they are especially helpful for cats, small and young dogs, small furry pets like rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, birds, and even reptiles. (To learn more about hydrosols, check out [Hydrosols 101](https://amywilliamsdelong.com/hydrosols-101/).) How do dried herbs and flowers help animals? Essential oils come from plants, and plants can be dried. In their dried form they're still aromatic and have the same beneficial properties as essential oils. It's just a different form! For example, German Chamomile. As an essential oil, it's okay to use with cats when diluted appropriately. But it's also available as dried flowers. Offering dried Chamomile Flowers can help calm nerves, aid digestion, reduce pain and inflammation. All this big Tom cat needed is to inhale chamomile from a baggy and he settled into deep sleep. (A baggy isn't the recommended way to offer herbs, but it worked for this family.) Herb Gardens are a fun way to offer dried plants to cats. In an Herb Garden, cats can interact with dried herbs any way they want, or need. They can sit or lay next to the herbs and sniff, or roll around in them. And of course, they can walk away if nothing suits them. Delilah explored the Herb Garden her \"mom\" set up for her in their living room. Each cloth has a different herb on it. The other cat in her home attacks her so Delilah was offered herbs for anxiety. (The other cat was offered the same herbs). This is Delilah's first time strolling through an herb garden. Watch as she checks out chamomile flowers and walks on to valerian root, goes over to rosebuds, then back for a nice roll in valerian root. (Valerian Root is really helpful for anxiety and conflict in multi-cat homes.) If your cat is anxious you could also try lavender flowers. If there's a history of trauma yarrow and angelica root might help. Herb Gardens are a wonderful way to support your cat's physical and emotional health. Plus they're fun and provide enrichment for indoor cats. If you want to give it a try I suggest starting with valerian root, it's very popular with cats. You could also try chamomile flowers, lavender flowers, or peppermint leaves (for digestive issues or pain). Just like essential oils, there's an herb (or hydrosol) to support most conditions. Just put some dried herbs on the floor (I suggest on a towel so it's easier to clean up,) and let your cat check it out. If you have more than one cat, it's best to avoid a cat fight! Allow one cat at a time, or create an Herb Garden for each cat. If you try it out, take a video. It's fun to share and maybe you can help someone else with their fur baby.
