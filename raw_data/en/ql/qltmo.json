Who's most at risk from cold weather? Some people are more vulnerable to the effects of cold weather. This includes: - people aged 65 and older - babies and children under the age of 5 - people on a low income (so cannot afford heating) - people who have a long-term health condition - people with a disability - pregnant women - people who have a mental health condition Get advice if you feel unwell If you're 65 or over, or in one of the other at-risk groups, it's important to get medical help as soon as you feel unwell. You can get help and advice from: - a pharmacy - pharmacists can give treatment advice for a range of minor illnesses and can tell you if you need to see a doctor - your GP - you may be able to speak to a GP online or over the phone, or go in for an appointment if they think you need to - NHS 111 - go to [111.nhs.uk](https://111.nhs.uk/)or call 111 if you have an urgent medical problem and you are not sure what to do The sooner you get advice, the sooner you're likely to get better.

Get your coronavirus (COVID-19) booster and flu vaccinations If you're at greater risk from COVID-19 and flu it's important to get the extra protection of vaccination in winter. You're eligible for a free flu vaccine if: - you're aged 65 or over (including if you will be 65 by 31 March 2024) - you're pregnant - you have certain long-term health conditions - you're in long-stay residential care - you receive a carer's allowance, or are the main carer for an older or disabled person who may be at risk if you get sick - you live with someone who is more likely to get a severe infection due to a weakened immune system - you're a frontline health or social care worker School aged children (Reception to Year 11) can also get a free flu vaccine. Some people who are eligible for the flu vaccine can also get a COVID-19 vaccine. For most people, flu is unpleasant, but for some it can be dangerous and even life-threatening. COVID-19 is also still making people very ill every day. Both vaccines are safe and effective, and are the best protection from these viruses. It's important to get both vaccines if you're invited. You need to have the flu vaccine every year because the viruses that cause flu change every year. Your immunity from the COVID-19 vaccine also reduces over time. This is why those at greater risk are being invited to get a booster. The best time to have the flu vaccine is in the autumn before flu starts spreading. But you can get the vaccine later. If you're eligible it's important to get these vaccinations ahead of winter when viruses circulate most and can cause the most harm.

Heat your home to a temperature that's comfortable for you. If you can, this should be at least 18\u00b0C in the rooms that you regularly use, such as your living room and bedroom. This is particularly important if you have a health condition. It's best to keep your bedroom windows closed at night. Check your heating and cooking appliances are safe.

Look in on vulnerable neighbours and relatives Remember that other people, such as older neighbours, friends and family members, may need some extra help over the winter. There's a lot you can do to help people who need support. Icy pavements and roads can be very slippery, and cold weather can stop people from going out. Keep in touch with your friends, neighbours and family and ask if they need any practical help, or if they're feeling unwell. Make sure they're stocked up with enough food supplies for a few days, in case they cannot go out. If they do need to go out in the cold, encourage them to wear shoes with a good grip and a scarf around the mouth to protect them from cold air, and to reduce their risk of chest infections. Make sure they get any prescription medicines before the holiday period starts and if bad weather is forecast.
