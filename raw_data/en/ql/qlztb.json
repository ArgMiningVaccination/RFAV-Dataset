You get to see your own patterns of breath, heartbeat, and more, as they are charted in real-time on a computer screen. You learn at-home daily techniques to bring your nervous system into balance. Biofeedback has been well-studied for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, PTSD, and various muscle tension disorders. Currently, Dr. Kathryn Hightower offers a package of six biofeedback visits or as part of her Holistic Counseling program. Sauna/Steam Shower Emerald City Clinic offers sauna and steam shower packages. Infrared sauna may be prescribed for detoxification, high cholesterol, endocrine dysfunction, or to boost your immune system. Our unique steam shower allows steam to be emitted without a stream of water. When combined with our special respiratory essential oil blend, steam showers are excellent for many kinds of respiratory conditions and for detoxification. Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy refers to the use of baths, wraps, rinses, and drinking water, to create change in the body. It is a simple, gentle way to heal on many levels. Long-term use of water therapy can improve circulation, reduce hypertension, eliminate varicose veins, tonify the nervous system, treat injuries, prevent illness, and more. Water affects the nervous, cardiovascular, immune, and endocrine systems. It is a wonderful therapy, because it is simple yet extremely effective. At Emerald City Clinic, we offer Constitutional Hydrotherapy. This treatment combines hot and cold water wraps with gentle electrical stimulation to increase cellular metabolism. This treatment may be prescribed by your Emerald City Clinic physician as an adjunctive therapy for anxiety, depression, gut issues, swelling, and more. Other hydrotherapy options currently offered include wraps and rinses, many of which you will learn to do at home, including the famous Magic Sock Treatment! Dr. Kathryn Hightower has extensive training in traditional hydrotherapy, through the Kneipp Schule for Physiotherapy in Germany.
