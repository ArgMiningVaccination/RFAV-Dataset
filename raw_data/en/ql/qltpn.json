From Preschool to 5th Grade every year unfolds with an intensity and a purpose that sparks curiosity and enthusiasm. Engaged Students We engage students with meaningful, rigorous academics, hands-on teaching, lessons infused with art, music and movement. As educators, we care about both the process \u2014 joyful, active learning \u2014 and the result: independent thinkers who act with purpose and compassion. [Long-Term View](https://waldorfmoraine.org/our-mission-history/) Our approach is not just to cover material, we uncover the gifts and potential of each child. We look beyond helping students to meet the challenges of today, and also ask what they need to meet the unknown challenges of tomorrow. Waldorf Education is education for life. "}
