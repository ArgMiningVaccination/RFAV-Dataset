About Bone Health issues Symptoms of calcium deficiency leads to adverse effect on bone texture, muscle spasms, tingling and numbness in feet, hands and face, depression etc. To build strong bones and stabilize blood pressure, calcium is required in the body. Calcium is required to support the proper functioning of muscles, heart rhythm and more. It maintains blood pressure, regulates blood clotting and prevents certain cancers. When body lacks calcium diseases like osteoporosis, rickets etc are caused. Causes of calcium deficiency include malnutrition, malabsorption i.e. when body does not absorb the minerals needed from the food consumed. Women should consume around 1500mg of calcium during and after the menopause. Osteoporosis causes the bones to become brittle because of bone loss. Osteoporosis can cause complications like spinal fractures, disability etc. Deficiency of calcium can lead to major diseases like cancer, heart diseases, infertility etc. Related: top homeopathy medicines for [bone disease treatment](https://homeomart.com/collections/homeopathy-medicines-list-bone-diseases) ingredients in Dr.Reckeweg R34 The key properties in Dr.Reckeweg R 34 drops are derived from the following ingredients to treat symptoms of calcium deficiency - Calcium fluorat -it acts on enamel of teeth. - Calcium hypophosphoric -it has regulating influence on calcium production in pregnancy. - Calcium phosphoric -treats perturbations in bones growth, calcium production deficiency and chronic headache of children suffering anaemia (lack of red blood cells). - Chamomilla -treats symptoms of calcium deficiency like head sweats, teeth and irritability. - Hekla lava -treats exostisis that affects the feet. - Mezereum -treats pain and inflammation of bone skin. - Mercur. praec. rub. -it acts against deficiency in osseous system, periostitis, exostisis accompanied with nocturnal pain in bones. - Silicea -it acts as stimulant of growth, and fights against fistulae (abnormal or surgically made passage between a hollow or tubular organ and the body surface) of bones.
