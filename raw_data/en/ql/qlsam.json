Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services t o clients and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply t o those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cign a Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Cer tificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD ) or similar plan document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plan s upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related t o a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the ev ent of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controll ing federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Cove rage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of t he applicable benefit plan document in effect on th e date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment and have discretion in making individual coverage deter minations. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations fo r treatment and should never be used as treatment g uidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other coverage determinations .

Other Procedures Each of the following refractive procedures is cons idered the following refractive procedures is cons idered experimental, investigational or unproven: automated lamellar keratomileusis (ALK) (i.e. stan dard keratomileusis) correction of expansion surgery (CPT \u00ae code 66999) General Background In the normal eye, both the cornea and lens functio n to refract or bend light rays and focus them on t he retina to produce clear images. Refractive error (ametropia) is present when parallel rays of light entering the non- accommodating eye do not focus on the retina. The e rrors are defects in the functioning power of the e ye due to an imperfectly shaped eyeball, cornea or lens, so t hat viewed objects are focused either in front of o r behind the retina, resulting in blurred vision. Refractive err ors include myopia, or nearsightedness; hyperopia, or farsightedness; astigmatism, in which an uneven cur vature of the cornea blurs vision for both near and far objects; and presbyopia, which is associated with a ging and loss of flexibility of the lens, limiting the ability of the eye to change its point of focus from far to near. Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory degenerative cond ition in which collagen fibers within the cornea we aken and progressively thin. As a result the thinning the fi bers can no longer maintain the normal round shape of the cornea. Consequently, the cornea bulges outward, st eepens and develops a progressive conical shape. Th is abnormality prevents light that is entering the eye from focusing directly on the retina, resulting in irregular astigmatism and progressive myopia or visual loss. Corneal ectasia, also known as keratectasia or iatr ogenic keratoconus, is caused by irregularities in the cor nea that lead to disturbances of vision as a result of astigmatism. The term corneal ectasia can refer to a group of conditions, most notably keratoconus, bu t can also be related to irregular astigmatism that can develo p after a patient undergoes refractive surgery (las er in situ keratomileusis [LASIK] or photorefractive my [PRK]). a keratoconus-like focal biomechanical disorder chara cterized by progressive distortion of the corneal s hape and optical quality. The cornea can continue to bulge, leading to a worsening of vision (Hersh, et al., 20 17; Seyedian, et al., 2015; American Academy of Ophthalmology [AA O], 2018). In a 2016 study, Woodward et al. found that Black a nd Latino Americans had significantly higher odds o f being diagnosed with keratoconus than white Americans (57 % and 43%, respectively), while Asian Americans wer e 39% less likely to develop the condition than white individuals. Other factors which have been found t o increase Page 4 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 the risk of development of keratoconus include asth ma, sleep apnea, Down syndrome, connective tissue disorders, allergic eye disease, a family history o f keratoconus, and Leber congenital amaurosis (Oyen iran and Gomes, et al ., 2015). Refractive surgery refers to surgical procedures de signed to correct refractive errors by reshaping th e corneal surface, and to improve the focusing power of the e ye, thus reducing or eliminating the need for corre ctive lenses. According to the AAO, refractive surgery is an elective procedure which may be considered by t hose who wish to become less dependent on spectacles or cont act lenses or when there is an occupational or cosm etic reason to not wear spectacles (AAO, 2017). The need to correct refractive errors depends on th e patient's symptoms and visual needs. Those with l ow refractive errors may not need correction. Small ch anges in refractive corrections in asymptomatic pat ients are usually not recommended. The major reasons for trea ting refractive errors are to improve visual acuity , function and comfort. Other reasons for treatment include en hancing binocular vision and decreasing strabismus. Patients with high refractive errors generally requ ire correction to achieve satisfactory vision. Opti ons for correcting refractive errors include spectacles, co ntact lenses or surgery. Spectacles should be consi dered before contact lenses or refractive surgery. The ma jority of adults can tolerate up to 3.0 D of differ ence in eyeglass refractive correction. Occasionally, indiv iduals may tolerate more than 3.0 D of difference ( AAO, 2018). Refractive Procedures Corneal Collagen Crosslinking Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) is proposed to minimize or stop the keratoconus disease process by strengthening and stabilizing the collagen lamellae by mimicking the age-related crosslinking that occ urs in the cornea over time. Ideally, the treatment results in mechanical stiffening of the cornea, decreasing th e disease progression (e.g., decreasing keratometry readings, increasing corneal thickness) (Hersh, et al., 2017 ). The original procedure, conventional CXL (C-CXL), a lso referred to as epithelium-off (Dresden protocol ), involves total removal of the epithelium prior to t he administration of riboflavin and ultraviolet. C- CXL uses a combination of riboflavin (vitamin B2) eye drops, a bsorbed throughout the cornea stroma, with ultravio let A (UVA) radiation to trigger a photochemical reaction that changes the crosslinks between and within col lagen fibers in the corneal stroma. After the riboflavin drops are applied to the cornea, the UVA irradiatio n is performed for 30 minutes at an intensity of 3 milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2). Common side effects of epithelium-off CXL include pain, corneal edema and mild stromal haze which typically resolve within a few days. Major long-term complications such as corneal ulcer ation, perforation, or scarring have been reported to be rare events (Hayes, 2020; Craig, et al., 2014). C-CXL has evolved into a standard treatment option for a defined subgroup of patients. The procedure i s FDA approved for individuals age 14-65 years, with prog ressive keratoconus or for the treatment of corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. Individuals with prog ressive deterioration in vision are considered appr opriate candidates. Serial eye exams may demonstrate a redu ction in uncorrected or best corrected visual acuit y, a change in refraction, increasing prescription stren gth for spectacles or contact lenses, and/or change in corneal shape (AAO, 2021b). Visual disturbance from a significant central corne al opacity or other eye disease such as herpetic ke ratitis, neurotrophic keratopathy, severe dry eye, or autoim mune disorders are not candidates for C-CXL. Cornea l opacity occurs when the cornea becomes scarred and light cannot pass through the cornea to the retina. The cornea may appear white or clouded over. Corneal op acity can be the result of infection, trauma, herpe s simplex virus and other diseases. These individuals are mor e likely to need a corneal transplant, and are unli kely to be helped by C-CXL (Choi and Donnenfeld, 2022; Hayes, 2020; Galvis, et al., 2017; U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA], 2016). One proposed modification of C-CXL is the epitheliu m-on procedure in which inta ct (also called transepithelial crosslinking [T-CXL]). This method requires more time for the riboflavin to pen etrate into the cornea but the potential advantage is decreasing th e risk for adverse effects such as infection and sc arring. Accelerated CXL (A-CXL) involves a similar UVA dose achieved in a shorter amount of time by increasing the Page 5 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 fluence rate or irradiance and decreasing the total exposure time. The shorter exposure time is intend ed to decrease the intra-procedure time. Topography-guide d CXL (TG-CXL) is performed using a customized, pat ient- specific UVA irradiation pattern that superimposes concentric circular zones over the keratoconic cone region of the corneal. The proposed benefit of TG-CXL is to d eliver varying amounts of energy depending on the s everity of the curvature, with higher levels of energy bein g delivered to the innermost zones compared with ou tmost zones. Finally, partial epithelium-removal CXL (P-C XL) is performed by partially removing the epitheli um in an effort to reduce corneal damage and promote faster re-epithelialization. Few studies have investigated the safety and effectiveness of these modified corneal crossli nking procedures (Choi and 2018; Aixinjueluo, et al., 2017; Craig, et al., 2014). Corneal collagen crosslinking has been investigated for use in the earlier stages of keratoconus and o ther corneal ectatic diseases including pellucid margina l degeneration (PMD), degenerative corneal diseases like Terrien Marginal Degeneration, and infectious kerat itis. C-CXL has been studied in the pediatric popul ation, however there is no consensus on treatment timing o r technique, and long-term data are still needed. C -CXL has been proposed as an adjunct procedure with other re fractive procedures including laser in-situ keratom ileusis photoref ractive is insufficient evidence t o support C-CXL for the treatment of these other co nditions or in combination with other refractive procedures (Oy eniran and Tauqeer, 2021; Davis, et al., 2020; Haye s, 2020; Wei, et al., 2019; Zhu, et al., 2018; Chan, et al., 2017; Galvis, et al., 2017; Randleman, et al., 201 5; Craig, et al., 2014). U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) On April 15, 2016, the FDA issued a new drug applic ation (NDA) approval for Photrexa Viscous to be used with the KXL System (A vedro, Inc., Waltham, MA), a UV light source, for t he treatment of progressive keratoconus. On July 15, 2 016, the FDA supplemented the NDA approval for the treatment of corneal ectasia following refractive s urgery. The NDA noted that the safety and effective ness of corneal collagen crosslinking has not been establis hed in patients aged < 14 years and the clinical tr ials did not include patients who were age 65 years or older (FD A, 2016). Literature Review Conventional Corneal Crosslinking (C-CXL) Epitheliu m-Off for Keratoconus: Studies in the form of systematic reviews, meta-analysis and/or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support the safety and effectiveness of conventional CXL epithelium off fo r the treatment of progressive keratoconus. Outcome s have reported a significant improvement in keratometry v alues (mean, maximum and minimum) and corrected distance visual acuity. Adverse events, such as cor neal hazing, have been minimal and transient. CXL h as also evolved into an accepted treatment for the manageme nt of progressive keratoconus (Hersh, et al., 2017; Seyedian, et al., 2015; Lang, et al., 2015; Li, et al., 2015; Sykakis, et al., 2015; Chunyu, et al., 2 014; Craig, et al., 2014; Wittig-Silva, et al., 2014; Hersh, et al., 20 11; Wittig-Silva, et al., 2008). Conventional Corneal Crosslinking (C-CXL) for Corne al Ectasia Following Laser al. (2017) conducted a randomized controll ed trial (n=179) to evaluate the safety and efficac y of corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) for the treatment of co rneal ectasia following laser refractive surgery. P atients were randomized to CXL with epithelium-off (n=91) or to the sham group that received riboflavin alone with epithelium left intact. Criteria for study participation ded: age years; axial topography ning with inferior:superior difference >1.5 diopter s [D]); corrected distance visual acuity [CDVA] worse than 20/20, and corneal thickness as measured on Pentacam (Oculus GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) of > 300 m at the thinnest area. The primary outcome measure was the change o f topography-derived maximum keratometry (K) over one year. Secondary outcomes included: corrected dista nce visual acuity (CDVA), manifest refraction spherical equival ent, endothelial cell count, and adverse events. In the CXL treatment group, there was a significant decrea se in the mean maximum K value (0.7 \u00b1 2.1 D) at 12 months pos toperatively compared to preoperative value (p<0.05 ). In the control group, there was a significant increase in the mean maximum K value (0.6 \u00b1 2.1 D) between baseline and 12 months postoperatively (p<0.05). The differe nce between maximum K change between treatment and control was statistically significant (p<0.0001). I n the crosslinking treatment group, there was a sig nificant improvement of 5.0 letters of visual acuity between preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively. In t he control Page 6 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 group, there was a loss of 0.3 letters. The differe nce in CDVA was 5.3 letters which was statistically significant (p<0.0001) at one year in favor of the CXL group. I n the CXL group, there was a significant improvemen t of 4.5 letters of visual acuity between at the preoperativ e baseline and 12 months follow-up. In the control group, there was a loss of 0.1 letter. The difference in UDVA ch ange at year one between CXL and control was 4.6 le tters, a statistically significant finding (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in manifest refractio n spherical equivalent (MRSE) or endothelial cell density analy ses between the groups. The only significant improv ement in the CXL group from the patient questionnaire was im provement in vision night driving (p<0.05). There w as one serious adverse event involving epithelial ingrowth beneath the LASIK flap on postoperative day 35. Th e ingrown cells were removed with resolution of the event. At the final 12-month visit, there were five eyes wit h persistent corneal haze and one corneal scar. Author-noted lim itations of the study included the fact that most e ye crossed over to CXL at three months. Two control eyes were available at the one year follow-up. A second limit ation of the control group is that the epithelium was not re moved in the control eyes. Additional limitations i nclude the small patient populations, number of patients lost to follow-up (n=29; 16%) and et al. (2022) conducted a randomized trial (n=79 eyes) to compare treatment outcomes of epithe lium-off corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) for pr ogressive keratoconus, using a standard versus an accelerated protocol. The study included patients age 18 yea rs with progressive keratoconus, and no prior history of ey e surgery. Excluded from the study were patients wi th herpetic keratitis or recurrent infections; disorders; or pregna nt or breastfeeding. All patients underwent epithelial de bridement and administration of a riboflavin soluti on. Forty two eyes (32 patients) were treated with a standard CXL procedure (UVA 365 nm wavelength for 30 minutes at 3.0 mW/cm2), and 37 eyes (30 patients) were treated wit h an accelerated CXL protocol (370 nm UVA light for 10 minutes at 9.0 mW/cm2). Outcome measures included b est corrected steepest meridian (Kmax); central corneal thickness (CCT); and demarcation line depth (DLD). Follow ups were completed at one, six, 12, and 24 months post-procedure. Both groups demonstrated sta tistically significant improvements in BCVA, MRSE, cylindrical values, Kmax, and CCT, with no signific ant between-group differences in these measures. Th e DLD to CCT ratio was significantly greater in the standard CXL group (66% vs. 62%, p=0.02), possibly due to t he limited riboflavin diffusion in the accelerated protocol. T he authors noted the lack of confocal microscopy an d topographic morphological indices analysis as limit ations of the study. Additional limitations include d the small patient population and underrepresentation of women . Larkin et al. (2021) conducted a randomized control led trial of pediatric patients (n=60) to compare c orneal crosslinking (CXL) plus standard care to stabilize progressive keratoconus, versus standard care alone . All subjects underwent corneal tomography, visual acuit y testing (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolu tion [logMAR]), refraction assessment, and apical cornea l thickness measurement. The eye with the more adva nced keratoconus was deemed the study eye. The CXL group underwent epithelium-off corneal crosslinking, and spectacle or contact lens correction in the study e ye, as needed. The control group received refractio n testing with provision of glasses and/or contact lens fitti ng for one or both eyes, as needed. The study inclu ded pediatric subjects aged 10-16 years with a diagnosis of progr essive keratoconus. Excluded from the study were pa tients with corneal opacification, corneal apex thickness of less than 400 m, mean corneal power in the stee pest meridian (K2) of more than 62 diopters (D), Down sy ndrome, or an inability to refrain from contact len s wear for seven days before follow-up tomography. The CXL gro up included a higher proportion of male participant s (83% vs 63% in the control group) and a higher proportio n of white individuals (40% vs 17%). Forty five per cent of all subjects were of South Asian or Asian British ances try. The mean age was 15 years. Outcome measures included: K2 in the study eye; progression refraction; quality of life (QoL). F ollow ups occurred every three months for 18 months . Of those randomized to the CXL group, one subject did not un dergo treatment, and another did not meet trial eli gibility but underwent CXL and was included in the analysis. In the control group, four subjects withdrew or were l ost to follow up, and five crossed over to the study arm a nd underwent CXL. A total of 23 control subjects co mpleted the 18-month follow up. At 18 months, the mean K2 i n the study eye was 49.7 D (standard deviation [SD] , 3.8 D) in the CXL group and 53.4 D (SD, 5.8 D) in the stan dard care group. The adjusted mean difference in K2 in the study eye was -3.0 D (95% [CI], On average , patients in the CXL group showed significantly lowe r logMAR values for uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity compared with those receiving standard care (p=0.002 and p=0.002, respectively). Keratoconus progression in the study eye occurred in two patien ts in the CXL group, versus 12 patients in the cont rol group. Page 7 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 There were no statistically significant difference between the groups in apical corneal thickness, ref raction measures as spherical equivalent, and quality of li fe scores. No adverse events were reported. Author- noted limitations of the study included the exclusion of some data due to unreliable tomography measurements , and a very significant overrepresentation of subjects of South Asian ethnicity, which is strongly associated with keratoconus in the UK, and which may limit the appl icability of study findings to other populations. T he authors also noted that only 43% of control subjects subseq uently showed clinical progression, indicating ther e may be a higher proportion of keratoconus patients in this a ge group who achieve spontaneous stabilization than previously expected. Additional limitations include short length of follow up, and high loss to follow up in the control group. Of note, the VibeX Rapid and Avedro KXL system used in this study are not currently app roved for use in the United States. Nath et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review an d meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=966 eyes) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transepithelial corneal crosslinking compared to e stablished epithelium-off corneal crosslinking for corneal ect asia. The majority of the studies were conducted in Europe. The authors included RCTs comparing transepithelial and epithelium-off crosslinking, and for narra tive reviews; commentaries; case rep orts; in vitro studies; studies with treatment for an indica tion other than ectasia; and studies comparing T-CX L to no treatment. Outcomes included the change in maximal keratometry (K max ) in diopters (D) at 12 months after crosslinking; K max at longest follow up; uncorrected and corrected di stance visual acuity; rate of disease progression; and complications. Length of follow up was one to three years. The change in K max differed significantly between the transepithelial and epith elium-off groups, with a larger decrease observed i n the epithelium-off group at 12 months (p=0.004) and at longest follow up (p<0.001). No significant differe nce was found between the two groups in corrected or uncorr ected distance visual acuity. Transepithelial cross linking was associated with significantly fewer complicatio ns than the epithelium-off method (p=0.020; rate of 2% versus 4%), although it was associated with an increased r ate of disease progression at 12 months (p=0.022). On average, 2% of subjects treated with the epithelium -off approach showed disease progression at the 12- month follow up, whereas 7% progressed in the transepithe lial cohort. Author-noted limitations included inab ility to complete subgroup analyses due to lack of detailed data, and some studies were noted to have a high ri sk of bias. Additional limitations were small patient pop ulations and heterogeneity of the intervention tech nique. Shajari et al. (2019) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the results of conven tional corneal crosslinking (C-CXL) and accelerated cornea l crosslinking (A-CXL) for the treatment of keratoc onus. (n=1158 eyes; n=577 C-CXL eyes, n=581 A-CXL eyes) randomized controlled trials, four prospective non- randomized comparative studies and four retrospecti ve reviews met the inclusion criteria. Complete and pu blished studies comparing C-CXL and A-CXL with at l east one predetermined outcome were included. Ex vivo, p ediatric studies and studies that combined corneal crosslinking and photorefractive keratotomy were ex cluded. The primary outcomes were measured changes in uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), correcte spherical and cylindrical error, minimu m corneal resistance factor (CRF), anterior stromal keratocyte density, sub-basal nerve density, endothelial cell density (ECD), percentage of hexagonal endothelial cells, as well as average, maximal and minimal keratometry va lues. Secondary outcomes included absolute demarcat ion line and time of re-epithelialization. C-CXL compar ed to A-CXL was statistically significant regarding minimum keratometry (p<0.00001) and demarcation line depth (p<0.00001), and A-CXL was statistically significan t regarding corneal thickness (p=0.0005). There was n o statistically significant difference in uncorrect ed distance visual acuity(p=0.09), corrected distance visual density (p =0.30) and morphology (p0.40). Out of the studies reviewed, only two reported adverse events post procedure whi ch included delayed epithelial healing in two cases of C-CXL and four cases of A-CXL. One study reported t ransient mild haze in ten eyes of C-CXL and ten eye s of A-CXL. Only one case of severe central haze was rep orted in the C-CXL population after the one month f ollow- up period. Post procedure follow-ups were recorded at one, three and six month intervals as well as at one year. Author noted limitations included: use of heterogen eous A-CXL protocols (e.g., various duration, compo sition and frequency of riboflavin exposure) and all trial s were weighed similarly regardless of study type. Larger studies with long term follow-ups are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of A-CXL versus C-CXL. Page 8 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 In a 2018 Directory Report, Hayes reviewed nine ran domized controlled trials (RCTs), two prospective t rials, six prospective comparative cohort studies, and six ret rospective comparative cohort studies. Sample sizes ranged from 50-205 eyes and follow-ups ranged from 1-3 app roaches varied, with the key differences in approac h being the removal/non-removal of the corneal epithe lium, and alteration in the fluence rate (irradianc e) and exposure time to UVA radiation. The overall quality of the body of evidence was rated as low. There wa s some evidence that CXL may slow or stop progression of k eratoconus by altering the corneal topography (i.e. , flattening of the cornea), but results were conflic ting. In addition, it is unclear how visual acuity and corneal thickness outcomes are affected by CXL. Most advers e events were transient and consisted primarily of delayed or impaired epithelial healing and corneal haze. Le ss common events included sterile infiltrates, stro mal or edema, herpes simplex included small pat ient populations and short-term follow-ups. There was a lack of evidence reporting on the quality-of-life f ollowing conventional C-CXL. The report made the following c onclusions: Conventional corneal crosslinking (C-CXL): There w as a moderately sized body of low-quality evidence that suggested some positive but inconsistent resul ts regarding the benefits of C-CXL for the treatmen t of progressive keratoconus in adolescent and adult patients compared with no treatment or sham treatment. Data for long-term safety and efficacy a re lacking. Accelerated corneal crosslinking (A-CXL) compared with C-CXL for the treatment of progressive keratoconus in adolescent and adult patients: There was a moderately sized body of low-quality evidence that suggested A-CXL is similar to C-CXL f or halting keratoconus progression. Data concerning long-term safety and efficacy of A-CXL c ompared with C-CXL is lacking. In A-CXL, a similar UVA dose (fluence) as used in C-CXL is achieved in a shorter amount of time by increasing the fluence rate or irradiance and decreasing the total exposur e time. Trans-epithelial corneal crosslinking (T-CXL) comp ared with C-CXL for the treatment of progressive keratoconus in adolescent and adult patients: There was a limited and low-quality body of evidence tha t C-CXL is superior to T-CXL for halting keratoconus progression. Long-term safety and efficacy data are lacking. Topography-guided corneal crosslinking (TG-CXL) or partial epithelium-off corneal crosslinking C-CXL for the treatment of progressiv e keratoconus in adolescent and adult patients. There was a paucity of evidence comparing these alt ernative CXL treatments with C-CXL. TG-CXL is performed using a customized, patient-specific UVA irradiation pattern that superimposes concentric circular zones over the keratoconic cone region of the corneal. In P-CXL, CXL is performed by partiall y removing the epithelium in an effort to reduce corn eal damage and promote faster re-epithelialization. In the 2020 annual review of this report twelve new abstracts were identified and did not change the 2 018 Hayes conclusion. The abstracts included one randomized c omparison study, three prospective nonrandomized studies, four cohort studies, and four systematic r eview and meta-analysis. Wen et al. (2018a) conducted a systematic review an d meta-analysis to compare standard epithelium-off corneal cross-linking (SCXL) and trans-epithelial corneal c ollage cross-linking for the treatment of k eratoconus. Eight studies (n=455 eyes) including five randomize d control trials, one prospective comparative study and one retrospective review met the inclusion criteria. St udies were included when the following criteria wer e met: 1) patients with keratoconus; 2) compared SCXL versus TECXL; and 3) contained at least one primary or secondary outcome measure. Studies were excluded th at had fewer than ten patients. The primary outcome s were measured by change in uncorrected distance vis ual acuity (UDVA), maximum keratometry (Kmax), and mean keratometry (mean K) at one year following eac h intervention. The secondary outcomes were measure d by changes in corrected distance visual acuity (CDV A), mean (CCT), endothelial cell density ( ECD), and the occurrence of adverse events at the o ne-year follow-up post CXL. At the one year follow-up, ther e was a significant reduction of mean K in the SCXL patient population compared with TECXL (p=0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in UDVA a nd Kmax. There were no significant differences between the two groups in CDVA, MRSE, CCT and ECD at the o ne year follow-up. There were few adverse events repor ted for both procedures. The major complications fo llowing SCXL were transient corneal edema and stromal as herpes simplex keratitis a nd sterile infiltrates were reported. No significant c omplications were observed or reported following TE CXL. Author- Page 9 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 noted limitations included: use of heterogeneous TE CXL protocol, different UVA illumination time, UVA irradiation intensity and riboflavin concentration; short term follow-up; and the limited number of in cluded studies. Additional randomized controlled trials with long t erm follow-up are needed to validate the effectiven ess of TECXL. Wen et al. (2018b) conducted a systematic review an d meta-analysis to compare standard corneal cross-l inking (SCXL) to accelerated corneal cross-linking (ACXL) for the treatment of keratoconus. Thirteen studies, seven randomized controlled trials and six non-randomized comparative studies (prospective and retrospective ), were included included wh en the following criteria were met: diagnosis of kerat oconus, comparison of SCXL versus ACXL, primary and secondary outcomes were reported and a minimum of s ix months follow-up. Studies not containing the abo ve criteria were excluded. The primary outcomes measur ed changes in uncorrected distance visual acuity (U DVA), mean keratometry and maximum keratometry. Secondary outcomes included corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), mean refractive spherical equivalent, centr al corneal thickness and endothelial cell density. Post procedural follow-ups were noted after six months b ut varied among studies with the longest term at 15 months. SCXL \"appeared\" to flatten the Kmax (n=12 studies) and reduce CCT (n=4 studies) greater than ACXL. ECD was reduced less following ACXL compared to SCXL (n =7 studies). There were no statistically significan t differences in the change of UDVA (n=7 studies), me an K (n=8 studies), CDVA (n=10 studies) and MRSE (n =9 studies). Only one trial reported an adverse event which was mild transient corneal haze after both pr ocedures. Author noted limitations included: heterogeneous AC XL protocols; variation in surgical procedures, ope rational techniques, and outcome measures; and short term fo llow-ups. Larger studies with long term follow-ups are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of SCXL ver sus ACXL and to establish a consistent protocol for ACXL. Rush and Rush (2017) conducted a randomized control led trial (RCT) (n=144) to compare conventional cor neal collagen crosslinking (C-CXL) (control group) to tr ans-epithelial collagen crosslinking (T-CXL) with e nhanced riboflavin solution (study group) for the treatment of corneal ectasia. Subjects, ages 10-70 years, ha d a Snellen BSCVA of 20/25-20/400 and a progressive corneal ect asia disorder (e.g., keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration or post-refractive surgery ectasia) wi th a preoperative minimum thinnest corneal pachymet ry measurement of at least 400 microns thick. Follow-u ps occurred for up to 24 months. The primary outcom e measure was change in the maximum simulated keratom etry value (K steep ). The secondary outcome was the change in the best spectacle-corrected visual acuit y (BSCVA). At 24 months the C-CXL group had signifi cant improvement in K steep (p=0.0381) and in BSCVA (p=0.0032) compared to bas eline. The T-CXL group had no significant change in K steep (p=0.4565) and a significant improvement in BSCVA (p=0.0164). The C-CXL group demonstrated a greater change in K steep compared with the T-CXL group at 12 and 24 months of follow-up (p=0.0409 and p=0.0320, respectively). There was no significant difference between the groups in the B SCVA at 12 (p=0.4978) and 24 months (p=0.4947). There was n o statistically significant difference in the numbe r of adverse events or in the rate of keratoplasty betwe en the C-CXL control group and the T-CXL study grou ps (p=0.0636 and p=0.1910, respectively). The authors noted that limitations of the study included: the u se of logMAR visual acuity as well as, the use of change in refraction to define disease progression and not collecting variables such as depth of treatment as measured on optical coherence tomography, change in pachymetry measurements and change in endothelial cell counts during the study interval. The T-CXL medical device and medication used in this procedure were not FDA appr oved. Soeters et al. (2015) conducted an RCT (n=61 patien ts/61 eyes) comparing the effectiveness eyes) In clusion criteria were age >18 years, clear central cornea, documented progression defined by an increase in Km ax, Ksteep , mean keratometry, and/or topographic cylinder val ue by >0.5 D over the previous 6-12 months. Patient s were excluded who had a minimal pachymetry of < 400 mm prior to UVA irradiation, or a history of previ ous ocular infection. The primary outcome measure was c linical stabilization of keratoconus after one year , defined as Kmax increase <1 diopter (D). Secondary outcomes included corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), corneal thickness, IOP and endothelial cell count. Transepithelial CXL showed less potent effects on keratoconus stabilization and regression compared t o epi-off CXL. The trend over time in Kmax flatteni ng was significantly different between the groups (p<0.022 ). There was a significant different trend in CDVA, with a more favorable outcome in the transepithelial group (p<0 .023). Corneal thickness remained stable in the tra ns- epithelial CXL group. The epi-off group showed an e xpected lowered optical pachymetry after treatment, which normalized at the 12-month time point. No differenc e in intraocular pressure over time was measured be tween Page 10 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 the groups; the endothelial cell counts were unrema rkable. Adverse events occurred in 4 of 26 eyes (15 %) in the epi-off group and included herpes simplex keratitis , stromal scar, and central haze. No complications were reported in the trans-epithelial group. Study limit ations include the un-blinded design and unequal sa mple size in groups. An RCT published by Al Fayez et al. (2015) (n=70 ey es) compared the safety and efficacy of epithelium- on (n=34 eyes) versus epithelium-off (n=36 eyes) CXL f or progressive keratoconus. Inclusion criteria were progressive (i.e., increase in the maximum K value or manifest astigmatism 1 D within the previous y ear) mild and moderate keratoconus (stages I and II on the Am sler-Krumeich scale), corneal thickness 400 mm, m ean K 53 D, and clear cornea with no Vogt striae. Pat ients were excluded if they had central corneal sca rring, previous ocular surgery, ocular surface pathology o r infection, or collagen vascular disease. The mean follow-up was 40 months with a primary outcome of change in t he maximum K reading (Kmax). Secondary outcomes wer e refraction, corneal pachymetry, endothelial cell co unt, intraocular pressure (IOP), and adverse events . Keratoconus stabilized or improved in all patients in the epithelium-off group, whereas only 15 patien ts (45%) in the trans-epithelial group stabilized or improved, and 19 patients (55%) progressed (p<0.0001). Compar ed to baseline, Kmax decreased significantly in the epith elium-off group and increased significantly in the trans- epithelial group after three years of follow-up. Th e difference between both groups was statistically significant (i.e., p=0.0007, p=0.0001, and p=0.0001 at one, two , and three years, respectively). The difference in UDVA was statistically significant in favor of the epitheliu m-off group at all follow-up points after one year. No statistically significant difference was found between groups in refraction, endothelial cell count, corneal thickne ss, or IOP at three years. These study results indicated that epi thelium-off was significantly more effective than t rans-epithelial corneal crosslinking in slowing the progression of keratoconus. Professional Societies/Organizations The 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Su mmary Benchmark for Preferred Practice Pattern \u00ae Guidelines on corneal ectasia includes a discussion of the initial and follow-up evaluation of the con dition. The guideline listed collagen crosslinking as a treatme nt option that can improve corneal rigidity by incr easing bonds between fibers. In the 2017 Refractive Errors and Refractive Surger y Preferred Practice Pattern \u00ae, AAO stated that options for the treatment of corneal ectasia after LASIK include co rneal crosslinking. Studies have shown that CXL ind uced by topical riboflavin and ultraviolet irradiation may arrest keratectasia, as demonstrated by preoperativ e and postoperative corneal topography/tomography and a r eduction in maximum keratometric readings. Long-ter m stability after CXL therapy for treatment of post-r efractive corneal ectasia has been reported and has received FDA approval. Corneal Relaxing/Corneal Wedge Resection - Astigmat ic Keratotomy (AK) AK procedures are those in which either transverse or arcuate incisions are made in the paracentral co rnea to change its curvature in order to reduce or eliminat e corneal astigmatism by allowing the cornea to bec ome more rounded when it heals. AK is often performed for th e correction of surgically-induced astigmatism and following medically-indicated cataract removal or corneal tra nsplant surgery. Variations of AK include the Ruiz Procedure and the Troutman Wedge Resection also referred to a s a corneal wedge resection. The wedge resection, o ften used with corneal relaxing incisions, effectively d ecreases astigmatism. However, clinical results hav e been reported to be unpredictable, therefore, the techni que is typically reserved for the correction of pos t-keratoplasty astigmatism of high degree. Limbal relaxing incisions (LRIs) or peripheral corn eal relaxing incisions are also a variant of AK in which incisions are placed just on the far peripheral aspect of the cornea. The incisions are created with blades desi gned to achieve a consistent depth. Femtosecond lasers may also be used to create arcuate incisions. LRIs may be used to treat low to moderate degrees of astigmatis m and have been performed alone or combined with ca taract extraction and intraocular lens implantation to red uce preoperative corneal astigmatism. (AAO, 2017). The correction of iatrogenic astigmatism is generally s upported, while the use of LRIs to treat astigmatis m not resulting from a prior surgery (e.g., correction of pre-existing, non-surgically induced astigmatism d uring cataract surgery) is considered not medically necessary. Page 11 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 The effectiveness of AK for correction of other ref ractive errors has not been proven in the literatur e. The AAO Preferred Practice Pattern on Refractive Errors sta ted that there are few well-controlled, prospective clinical studies available on AK performed alone or in conne ction with other keratorefractive procedures (AAO, 2017). Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments (INTACS) This procedure involves inserting a flexible ring beneath the surf ace of the cornea to elevate the edge of the cornea to flatten the front of the eye, decreasing nearsightedness. Different size rings are used to c orrect different degrees of nearsightedness. Intrastromal corneal ring segments have been investigated for tw o indications\u2014as a refractive procedure to correct mi ld myopia and as a treatment of keratoconus. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): On April 9, 1999, INTACS (Keravision Inc., Fremont, CA) received premarket application (PMA) approval from the FDA for the treatment of adults with mild myopi a (from - 1.0 to -3.0 D) who have 1.0 D of astigmatism. Int rastromal corneal ring segments are considered not medically necessary for patients with mild myopia. They are c onsidered investigational for children, for patient s with moderate to severe myopia (greater than -3.0 D), fo r patients with more than 1.0 D of astigmatism, and for hyperopia. On July 26, 2004, INTACS \u00ae prescription inserts for keratoconus (Addition Tech nology, Sunnyvale, CA) received humanitarian device exempt (HDE) approval from the FDA. A humanitarian use device (HUD) is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA. According to t he FDA, INTACS prescription inserts are indicated for the reduction or elimination of myopia and astigmatism in a specific subset of patients with keratoconus w ho meet all of the following criteria: progressive deterioration in vision, such that ade quate functional vision on a daily basis with conta ct lenses or spectacles can no longer be achieved 21 years of age or older clear central corneas corneal thickness of 450 microns or greater at the proposed incision site corneal transplantation is the only remaining opti on to improve functional vision Literature Review: Case series and comparative trials have evaluated the safety and effectiveness of intrastromal corneal implants for keratoconus (Torq uetti, et al., 2003; Boxer, et al., 2003; Colin, et al., 2001). Some studies have had l imitations including retrospective design, small sa mple size, and short-term follow-up. However, results of the a vailable evidence indicate that the use of intrastr omal corneal implants for individuals with keratoconus is associ ated with improved functional vision and can defer or possibly eliminate the need for corneal transplantation. Intrastromal corneal ring segments have been invest igated as a treatment for corneal ectasia after LAS IK. According to the AAO, reported techniques vary in t he size, number, and symmetry of the implants as we ll as the location of the incision. Although early results sh ow potential, long-term efficacy for this procedure remains to be determined (AAO, 2017). Treatment for post- LASIK e ctasia is not an FDA-approved indication for intras tromal corneal ring segments. Laser in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) LASIK is a type of laser surgery of the cornea performed to correct refractive errors. A slice of the patien t's cornea is removed, shaped to the desired curvature with an excimer laser, and then sewn back to the re maining cornea. In recent years, LASIK surgery has become t he procedure of choice for treating moderate to hig h levels of myopia, with or without astigmatism. In 1995, th e first refractive laser systems approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were the excimer lasers f or use in photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) to trea t myopia and, later, to treat astigmatism. Physicians then b egan using these lasers for LASIK surgery and to tr eat refractive disorders other than myopia. The laser e mits an ultraviolet beam that is able to reshape th e cornea. Refractive errors are minimized with the aid of a p rogrammed computer that, using a patient's refracti on and corneal topography, controls the laser beam to prec isely remove corneal tissue. Residual refractive errors after penetrating kerato plasty are usually responsible for decreased visual acuity despite a clear graft. The mean amount of astigmati sm that has been reported after penetrating keratop lasty for Page 12 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 keratoconus is usually between 2 and 6 D. Correctio n with spectacles or contact lenses should be consi dered initially, followed by the possibility of incisiona l refractive surgery if the patient is intolerant t o either of these alternatives. The goals of LASIK after penetrating keratoplasty are to decrease the degree of anisomet ropia and ametropia to levels at which correction with glasse s or contact lenses can be tolerated (Sierra and Ha rdten, 2019). Anisometropia means that the two eyes have a different refractive power, so there is unequal fo cus between the two eyes. This is often due to one eye having a slightly different shape or size from the other causing asymmetric curvature (astigmatism), (myopia). U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): The FDA has granted PMA approval to manufacturers of LASIK laser systems for the treatment of myopia, hyperopi a, and astigmatism, and for PRK to treat hyperopia and astigmatism. On July 30, 1998, the Kremer Excimer L aser System \u00ae (PhotoMed, Inc., King of Prussia, PA) was granted premarket approval by the FDA for treatment of myopia and astigmatism (FDA, 2018). However, LA SIK is considered not medically necessary for the treat ment of myopia between -1.0 and -15.0 diopters (D), with or without astigmatism up to 5.0 D because this can be corrected satisfactorily with eyeglasses or contac t lenses. LASIK has not been shown to be effective for the tr eatment of high myopia greater than -15.0 D, hypero pic astigmatism greater than 5.0 D, and for all other r efractive errors. Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) PRK involves the reshaping of the surface of the co rnea with an excimer laser to correct mild-to-moder ate myopia. The laser alters the anterior curvature to modify a particular refractive error by varying the ablation pattern. Photoastigmatic keratectomy (PARK or PRK-A ) is a surgical procedure used to correc t myopia with astigmatism. Both procedures are considered no t medically necessary for patients with hyperopia o f up to 6.0 D, and myopia of up to -10.0 D, with or without astigmatism up to 4.0 D, because the refractive co rrections achieved with PRK and PARK are less precise than th at achieved by eyeglasses or contact lenses. PRK an d PARK are considered investigational for patients wi th hyperopia greater than 6.0 D, myopia greater tha n -10.0 D, astigmatism greater than 4.0 D, and for all other r efractive errors. This is based on the FDA-approved indications for PRK and PARK. Professional Societies/Organizations: The American Academy of Ophthalmology Ophthalmic P rocedure Assessment of PRK concluded that \"it appears to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of low to moderate degrees of myopia and astigmatism. Results for high degrees of myopia are associated with poo rer outcomes, that is, longer stabilization periods, gr eater need for re-treatment, and increased loss of lines of BSCVA\" (No authors listed, 1999). The AAO Preferred Practice Pattern on Refractive Errors states that published reports of PRK document a median rate of 92% of patients achieving 20/40 uncorrected vision and 70% of patients achieving 20/20 uncorrected vision at 12 or more months following PRK for myopia (AAO, 2017). Eye disorders such as keratoconus, where the cornea becomes progressively thinner and cone shaped, may result in a large amount of astigmatism resulting i n poor vision that cannot be clearly corrected with spectacles. Keratoconus usually requires contact lenses for cle ar vision, and it may eventually progress to a poin t where a corneal transplant is necessary (American Optometri c Association [AOA], 2018; reviewed 2019). Other Procedures Conductive Keratoplasty (CK ): CK is the application of radiofrequency thermal energy to increase the curvature of the cornea and thereby reduce hyperopi a. On April 11, 2002, ViewPoint CK System \u00ae (Refractec Inc., Irvine, CA) received PMA approval from the FD A. Based on data submitted with the PMA application , the ViewPoint CK System \u00ae is approved for the treatment of patients who are a t least 40 years of age, who have mild to moderate hyperopia (0.75 D to 3.25 D), 0.75 D or less astigmatism, and whose eyesight has changed v ery little over the previous 12 months, as demonstrated by a change of less than 0.50 D in refraction. Acc ording to the FDA, CK improves distance vision in farsighted people, but the amount of farsightedness correction is not always permanent. Those who require very acute visi on for work-related activities may still need glass es, and glasses will also be needed for reading. Currently, there is insufficient evidence in the pe er-reviewed literature to support the effectiveness of CK for the treatment of presbyopia. Studies are primarily in t he form of case series with small sample sizes (n=1 0-27) and Page 13 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 follow-ups of 1-3 years (Ye, et al., 2011; Stahl, 2 007). A larger series by McDonald and colleagues (2 004) reported preliminary results of a multicenter clini cal trial supported by the FDA to evaluate the effe ctiveness of CK for the treatment of presbyopic symptoms of emme tropic and hyperopic eyes. A total of 143 patients with presbyopic symptoms were enrolled in this one-year study and treated to improve near vision in one eye (unilateral treatment). In addition, 33 fellow eyes were treated to improve distance vision (bilateral treatment). At six months follow-up, 77% of examined eyes had J3 o r better monocular UCVA, and 85% of patients had binocular UCVA of 20/25 or better distance along wi th J3 or better near, a combination that represents functional acuity for a presbyopic individual. Of eyes treated with CK, 92% had an uncorrected binocular vision o f 20/32 and J5, which also allows a high degree of uncorrec ted visual function. It was noted that follow-up wa s too short for meaningful determination of refractive stabilit y; follow-up to three years and beyond is needed fo r accurate evaluation of stability. According to the AAO (2017) disadvantages of CK inc lude early overcorrection, regression and induced astigmatism. The procedure is not frequently used t oday. Lamellar Keratoplasty (Non-Penetrating Keratoplasty ): This is a corneal transplant procedure in which a partial thickness of the cornea is removed. The dis eased tissue is replaced with a partial-thickness d onor cornea. There are two types of lamellar anter endothelial ker atoplasty). Lamellar keratoplasty may be indicated for a number of corneal diseases, including scarring, edema, thinning, distortion, dystrophies, degenerations and keratoco nus. However, it is considered not medically necess ary when performed solely to correct astigmatism and other r efractive errors. Laser Thermokeratoplasty (LTK) (Other Than Conducti ve Keratoplasty): LTK utilizes the following methods: superficial treatment of Gassett and Kaufman for ke ratoconus, holmium, YAG laser thermokeratoplasty, o r the hot needle of Fyodorov. Based on review of the lite rature, all of these methods of thermokeratoplasty have been abandoned in current refractive surgery because the corneal wound-healing response produces postoperat ive scarring and instability. Limbal Relaxing Incisions (LRIs): LRIs, or peripheral corneal relaxing incisions, ar e a variant of astigmatic keratotomy (AK) (see above) in which incisions are placed just on the far peripheral aspect of the cor nea. LRIs may be used to treat low to moderate degrees of ast igmatism and have been performed alone or combined with cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantati on to reduce preoperative corneal astigmatism (AAO, 2017). As such, the use of LRIs to treat astigmatism that is not surgically induced is considered not medically necessary. Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK) (Corneal Transplantat ion, Perforating Keratoplasty): PK involves replacement of the full-thickness of the cornea wit h a donor cornea, but retains the peripheral cornea . As with lamellar keratoplasty, this procedure may be indica ted for a number of corneal diseases. Most PKs are performed to improve poor visual acuity caused by a n opaque cornea. PK has also been used to remove ac tive corneal disease, such as persistent severe bacteria l, fungal, or amebic inflammation of the cornea (ke ratitis) after appropriate antibiotic therapy. The most common ind ications for PK are: bullous keratopathy, keratocon us, corneal trans plant rejection, Fuch's dystrophy, corneal PK is considered not medically neces sary when performed solely to correct astigmatism or oth er refractive errors. Surgically induced astigmatis m is a potential complication of PK that may require refra ctive surgery. Radial Keratotomy (RK): RK involves the use of radial incisions in the cor nea to correct mild to moderate myopia. RK has been performed infrequently since th e keratectomy (PRK) and necessa ry for treatment of myopia ranging from -2.00 to -8 .00 D, because this refractive error can be corrected sati sfactorily with eyeglasses or contact lenses. Radia l keratotomy is considered investigational for treatment of myop ia greater than -8.00 D. It is also considered inve stigational for the treatment of all other refractive errors becaus e of the high rate of complications that include st arbursts, anterior chamber perforation, and infectious kerati tis. Automated Lamellar Keratoplasty (ALK): ALK, also referred to as standard keratomileusis, is a technique that shapes the cornea with a microkeratome, an oscillat ing sharp blade used to incise the corneal stroma b eneath Page 14 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 the Bowman membrane, rather than with a laser. It i s considered investigational for treatment of all r efractive errors. The AAO Preferred Practice Pattern on Refra ctive Errors assessment stated that ALK had only fa ir predictability. Complications of ALK include irregu lar astigmatism, thin flaps, free or displaced caps , anterior chamber perforation, interface opacities, infectiou s keratitis, and epithelial ingrowth. The AAO has f urther stated that ALK has been largely abandoned due to the adve nt of laser-in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) (AAO, 20 17). Corneal Inlay: Corneal inlays have been proposed as a treatment f or presbyopia. The device is a thin disc shaped lens with micro-perforations proposed to hel p focus images clearly within the eye like glasses or contact lenses. Although the inlay has no refractive power, the goal of the device is to have the central open ing function as a pinhole to increase depth of focus and improve near vision without changing distance vision (AAO, 2015). The inlay is implanted through a pocket-shaped lase r incision of the cornea. Variations of corneal inl ays described in the literature include the KAMRA \u00ae (AcuFocus, Irvine, CA); the Raindrop CA), and the Flexivue Microlens (Pre sbia, Amsterdam). On April 17, 2015, the KAMRA \u00ae inlay (AcuFocus Inc., Irvine, CA) received premar ket application (PMA) approval from the FDA for the treatment of presbyop ia. According to the FDA, The Kamra inlay is indica ted for intrastromal corneal implantation to improve near v ision in patients between the ages of 45 and 60 yea rs with presbyopia who have not had cataract surgery. Contr aindications to device implantation include severe dry eye syndrome, eye infection or inflammation, and kerato conus. The pivotal study was a prospective, single- armed, multicenter clinical trial (n=508). The non-dominan t eye of subjects was implanted with the AcuFocus c orneal inlay. Patient selection criteria included uncorrec ted near visual acuity worse than 20/40 and better than 20/100 in the eye to be implanted, as well as distance vis ual acuity correctable to at least 20/20 in both ey es. Exclusion criteria included cataracts, corneal abnormalities, uncontrolled eyelid disease and keratoconus. At 12 months of follow-up, 80.8% of subjects achieved the primary e ffectiveness endpoint of uncorrected near visual ac uity of 20/40 or better. Post-approval evaluation of the de vice required by the FDA includes a prospective mul ti-center observational study designed to monitor the safety of patients who participated in the pivotal trial a nd are still implanted with the KAMRA Inlay. Patients will be fo llowed for an additional two years for a total of f ive years post-implantation. The KAMRA inlay has been markete d outside the US since 2009 and is available in 50 countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Ch ile, Hungary, Japan, Jordan, South Korea, Lebanon, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Singa pore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates (FDA, 20 15). On June 16, 2016, the Raindrop \u00ae Near Vision Inlay \u00ae (ReVision Optics, Inc., Lake Forest, CA) received premarket application (PMA) approval from the FDA f or the treatment of presbyopia. According to the FD A, the Raindrop Near Vision Inlay was indicated for intras tromal implantation to improve near vision in the n on- dominant eye of phakic, presbyopic patients with th e following characteristics: 41 to 65 years of age manifest refractive spherical equivalent of +1.00 diopters (D) to -0.50 D with 0.75 D of refractive cylinder do not require correction for clear distance visio n, require near correction of +1.50 D to +2.50 D of r eading add The pivotal study for FDA approval was a multicente r prospective, single-armed, non-randomized clinica l trial (n=373 patients). Selection criteria for subjects i ncluded presbyopic adults, needing from +1.50 D to +2.50 D of reading add with uncorrected near visual acuity wor se than 20/40 and better than 20/200 in the non-dom inant eye. Two years after implantation, the primary effe ctiveness endpoint was met, with 92% of patients (3 36/364) able to see with 20/40 vision at near distances w ith the inlay-implanted eye. The adverse event (AE) safety endpoints were that the total number of AEs should occur in < 5% of eyes and any single AE should occu r in < 1% of eyes. Of the 22 AE categories, seven AE categ ories (e.g., secondary surgical intervention: 44/37 3 [12%]) exceeded the target rate of 1% (FDA, 2016). In Marc h 2019, the FDA issued a Class 1 Device Recall of t he Raindrop Near Vision Inlay, due to an increased ris k of corneal haze. The inlay is not currently (PresbiBio, is a refractiv e optic corneal inlay that functions by altering the corneal index of refracti on to improve near vision performance, by the means of a bifocal optic which separates distance and near foc al points. The basic principle is corneal multifoca lity, providing distance vision through a plano central zone surrou nded by one or more rings of varying additional pow er for intermediate and near vision. The Flexivue Microlen s is a 3-mm-diameter, transparent hydrogel-based im plant Page 15 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 made from a hydrophilic acrylic material and contai ns an ultraviolet blocker. Depending on the add pow er, the thickness of the inlay varies from 15 m to 20 m. The Microlens received its CE Mark for the European Economic Area. It is not currently FDA-approved and is not commercially available in the U.S. (Beer, e t al., 2020; Presbia, 2022; Moarefi, et al., 2017). Additional options in being stud ied with the Presbyopic Allogenic Refractive Lentic ule (PEARL) techniques. PEARL is a procedure that places a smal l piece of tissue from one part of the cornea into another part. The inlay is proposed to change the shape of the cornea with the goal of improving near vision. The surgeon uses a laser to make a small cut in the cor nea. A lenticule (a small disc of corneal tissue) i s removed through the cut. The lenticule is sculpted and resh aped with a laser, then placed into a small pocket made in the patient's cornea. Because the inlay is made of the patient's own tissue, it is biologically compatible , making it less likely to cause complications of artificial co rneal inlays. The procedure is still under investig ation (Moarefi, et al., 2017; Boyd, 2016). Evidence in the published peer-reviewed medical lit erature evaluating the safety and effectiveness of corneal inlays is primarily in the form of case reports and case series (Linn, et al., 2017; Verdoorn, 2017; W hang, et et al., al., 2015; Yilmaz, et al., 2011; Seyeddain, et al., 2010). These studies included small patient populations (n =24-60) with follow-up periods ranging from six mon ths to four years. Adverse events included cataract progre ssion and device explantation. Vukich et nonran domized multicenter open-label single-arm study (n= 507) to evaluate safety and efficacy of the Kamra corne al inlay. Patients, aged 45-60 years, with presbyop ia and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) to 20/20 in both eyes were included in the study. The eye to b e implanted had uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) between 20/40 of +0.50 diopters (D) to -0.75 D with 0.75 D or less of refractive cylinder, and required a near correction of +1.00 to +2.50 D of reading addition (add). The eyes also had a minimum central corneal thickness of 500 m, corneal power 41.00 D and 47.00 D in all meridians and an endothelial cell count of m ore than 2000 cells/mm 2. The primary outcome was the percentage of eyes wi th a UNVA 20/40. Several subgroups were predetermined before study initiation to measu re contrast sensitivity (n=335), defocus curve (n=1 14), and visual fields (n=224). The corneal inlay was implan ted under a lamellar resection, either a corneal po cket created by a femtosecond laser (n=471) or under a corneal f lap (n=37) created by a mechanical microkeratome. T he mechanism of action of the Kamra (increase in depth of focus by blocking peripheral unfocused rays of light) was reflected in the defocus curves. Reported outcomes at 36 months included the following: The implanted eyes exhibited 3.5 diopters of defoc us range above 20/40, with 363/417 patients and near visual acuity (UNVA). The mean visual acuities significant ly improved for both positive and negative defocus after implantation. Patients implanted via a femtosecond laser pocket procedure demonstrated further improved near vision, with 131/145 patients (90.3%), 137/145 UDVA of 20/25 or better was maintained in 135/145 patients (93.1%) and 100% of implanted eyes. The results of a patient questionnaire showed that for those in the pocket group, near vision tasks w ere all graded as much easier to perform postoperativel y than preoperatively (p<0.001). Minimal change was reported in ease of performing distance vision task s. There was a significant reduction in the ease of watching television and driving at night (p<0.05). Ocular adverse events included decreases in CDVA of 2 lines and secondary surgical interventions whi ch included six inlay repositionings and 44 removals ( 8.7%). The removal rate was significantly less in t he pocket group and further reduced with deeper implantation. There was also one event each of corneal edema, co rneal haze, amorphous material around a fold in the inlay , and stromal thinning secondary to abnormal healin g response to corneal trauma. Less than 1.0% of the p atients reported severe glare or halos postoperativ ely. Author-noted limitations of the study included the fact that the questionnaire was not validated befor e the study; the deep implantation cohort was small relative to the whole cohort size; and the subgroups of lamella r resection and implantation depth were created following the s tudy, which limited the statistical power of the an alyses on these variables. Another limitation was the number of patients lost to follow-up (n=49; 8.7%). Page 16 of 28 Medical Coverage Hexagonal Keratotomy: This technique uses a computer-assisted microkeratome to reshape the cornea. It works similarly to a carpenter's plane, making a he xagonal pattern of cuts versus the radial cuts seen in radial keratotomy (RK). Hexagonal keratotomy has been used to treat hyperopia which occurs naturally and also to treat presbyopia after RK. Hexagonal keratotomy is now rarely used, as newer techniques in refractive surgery have been developed. Keratophakia: This technique involves the insertion of a donor cornea lens into the corneal stroma to change the shape of the cornea and modify its refractive p ower. Keratophakia was not addressed in the AAO Pre ferred Practice Pattern on Refractive Errors and Refractiv e Surgery, and there is a paucity of studies evalua ting keratophakia for refractive errors. The effectivene ss of keratophakia for correction of refractive err ors has not been proven in the peer-reviewed medical literature . Laser Epithelial Keratomileusis (LASEK): LASEK, of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), is a surface ablation procedure that attempts to preserv e the epithelium. The postoperative outcomes of LAS EK have been reported to be similar to those of PRK. Propos ed advantages of LASEK compared to LASIK are that m ore stromal tissue is reserved, and flap-related compli cations do not occur. However, patients undergoing LASEK experience more postoperative discomfort and slower recovery of vision than those who have had LASIK. The AAO Preferred Practice Pattern on Refractive Errors and Refractive Surgery stated that the potential f or the development of corneal haze remains a concern since LASEK is a modification of PRK (AAO, 2017). There is a lack of evidence in the peer-reviewed literature to support the safety and efficacy of this procedure. Kuryan et al. (2017) published results of a Cochran e review (n=3 RCTs/154 subjects) to assess the effe cts of LASEK versus LASIK for correcting myopia. RCTs were selected in which myopic subjects were assigned randomly to receive either LASEK or LASIK in one or both eyes. Patients were included in the studies w ho were between the ages of 18 and 60 years with myopia up to 12 D and/or myopic astigmatism of severity up to 3 D, and who did not have a history of prior refractive surgery. All trials enrolled participants with mild to moderate myopia (< -6.50 D); only one trial included subject s with severe myopia (> -6.00 D). The primary outco me measure was uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) at 12 months. The evidence showed uncertainty as to wheth er there was a difference between LASEK and LASIK in U CVA at 12 months. People receiving LASEK were less likely to achieve a refractive error within 0.5 dio pters of the target at 12 months follow-up (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.48 to 0.99; 57 very low-certainty evidence). One trial reported mild corneal haze at six months in one eye in the LASEK group and none in the LASIK group (RR 2.1 1, 95% CI 0.57 to 7.82; 76 eyes; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included trials reported pos toperative pain score or loss of visual acuity, sph erical equivalent of the refractive error, or quality of l ife at 12 months. Patients receiving LASEK were les s likely to achieve a refractive error within 0.5 diopters of t he target at 12 months follow-up (very low-certaint y evidence). In terms of adverse events, refractive regression was reported only in the LASEK group (8/37 eyes) compar ed to 0/39 eyes in the LASIK group in one trial (low-cert ainty evidence). Likewise, low-certainty evidence o f one trial reported adverse events of corneal flap striae and refractive over-correction only in the LASIK group (5/39 eyes) compared to 0/37 eyes in the LASEK group. This revi ew was limited by the small sample sizes in studies and the low quality of the available evidence. The authors concluded that large, well-designed RCTs are needed to estimate the magnitude of any difference in efficac y or adverse effects between LASEK and LASIK for (mini-RK): Mini-RK is a modified radial keratotomy procedure that reduces the millimeters of cornea incised. The goal is to maxim ize corneal flattening with a minimum length and nu mber of incisions. Mini-RK is considered an investigational procedure. Orthokeratology: Orthokeratology also called ortho-K, is the use of rigid gas-permeable contact lenses as a nonsurgical and reversible method for the treatment of mild to moderate myopia. The center of the cont act lens is deliberately fitted flatter than the central cor neal curvature to transiently induce central cornea l flattening, by a thinning or molding of the epithelium, which is pro posed to reverse myopia during the day when the len s is not worn. However, the corneas tend to revert back to t heir original shape when the lens is not worn. The most serious complication that has been associated with orthokeratology is microbial keratitis. Rigid gas permeable lens are approved by the FDA as 510(k) Class II devices. FDA published an industry Guidance for Premarket Submissions of Orthokeratolo gy Rigid Gas Permeable Contact Lenses (FDA, last Page 17 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 updated March 2018). In their discussion of types o f contact lenses, the FDA requires that eye care professionals be trained and certified before using overnight Ortho-K lenses in their practice. An exa mple of an FDA approved gas permeable contact lens is the Bost on XO 2 (Bausch & Lomb, Inc., Rochester, NY). One of the approved intended uses of the lens is \"daily wear f or the correction of refractive with non-diseased eyes. Also, the lense s may be prescribed in other wise non-diseased eyes that require a gas permeable contact lens for the manage ment of irregular corneal conditions such as keratoconus, p ellucid marginal degeneration, or following penetra ting keratoplasty or refractive (e.g., LASIK) surgery.\" (FDA, 2007). The July 2017 AAO Preferred Practice Pattern on Ref ractive Errors and Refractive Surgery stated that a ttempts to predict which patients would respond to orthoker atology based on ocular biomechanical or biometric parameters have not been successful. The effects of orthokeratology have been unpredictable and poorly controlled. There are substantial variations in cha nges in eye length among children and there is no w ay to predict the effect for individual subjects. There i s a lack of evidence showing that orthokeratology c an slow the progression of myopia. According to AAO, the safest way to incorporate contact lenses into clinical pr actice for reduction of axial elongation in young children rem ains to be determined. There is insufficient evidence in the published, pe er-reviewed literature to support the effectiveness of orthokeratology for the treatment of myopia. Studie s are primarily in the form of case reports, retros pective reviews and case series with small patient populati ons, short-term follow-up and conflicting results. There is also a lack of data regarding a regimen for discontinuin g the Ortho-K (Tsai, et al., 2021; Zhong, et al., 2 020; Kang, 2018; Si, et al., 2015; Sun, et al., 2015). In a systematic review and meta-analysis Si et al. (2015) reported that orthokeratology may slow the p rogression of myopia in children but due to the limited eviden ce large-scale studies are needed to substantiate t he results and to investigate the long-term effects of orthoke ratology in myopia control. Studies were included i f they included myopic patients aged 18 years; compared orthokeratology with control subjects (single-visio n spectacles or soft contact lenses); and reported ax ial length (AL) elongation or more information rele vant to myopia progression (e.g., vitreous chamber depth el ongation). Two randomized controlled trials and fiv e nonrandomized controlled trials (n=435) met inclusi on criteria with 218 children being treated with orthokeratology. Maximum follow-up was two years. S ubjects were aged 6-16 years. The weighted mean difference was -0.26 mm (p< 0.001) for axial length elongation based on data from seven studies and -0 .18 mm (p=0.02) for vitreous chamber depth elongation base d on data from two studies showed significant impro vement with ortho-K. The author-noted limitations were: sm all sample sizes, short-term follow up, limited the reliability of the results, and the heterogeneity of the patient p opulation, study protocols and designs. The authors noted that because the mechanism of myopia progression is stil l debatable, additional studies are needed to furth er elucidate the potential biological mechanisms that are involved. Sun et al. (2015) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical treatment e ffects of orthokeratology to slow the progression of myopia. Seven studies (n=546) met inclusion criteria includ ing two were randomized controlled trials, two retrospectiv e reviews and three observational studies. Subjects were ages 6-16 years and follow-ups were for two years. The m ain outcomes included axial length and vitreous cha mber depth. All studies reported axial length changes af ter two years and two studies reported vitreous cha mber depth changes. The pooled estimates indicated that change in axial length in the ortho-k group (n=218) was 0 .27 mm less than the control group and myopic progression was reduced by approximately 45%. The combined resu lts revealed that the difference in vitreous chamber de pth between the two groups was 0.22 mm in favor of ortho-K. None of the studies reported severe adverse events. Limitations of the studies included: small patient populations, short-term follow-up, drop-out rates o f 12.4%-46.2% and the retrospective study designs. Well- designed randomized controlled trials with large po pulations and long-term follow-ups are needed to as sess the effectiveness of ortho-K for the treatment of myopi a. Van Meter et al. (2008) performed a technology asse ssment of case reports and noncomparative case seri es (n=75) to evaluate the safety of overnight orthoker atology for the treatment of myopia. It was found t hat overnight orthokeratology is associated with complications in cluding infectious keratitis and induced astigmatis m, however the prevalence and incidence of complications have not been determined. The authors noted that overnig ht orthokeratology puts patients at risk for vision-th reatening complications they may not encounter othe rwise. Page 18 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 Large, well-designed randomized controlled studies are needed to provide a more reliable measure of th e risks of treatment and to identify risk factors for compl ications Overnight orthokeratology for slowing the progression of myopia in children also needs well-designed and pro perly conducted controlled trials to investigate ef ficacy (Van Meter, et al., 2008). Scleral Expansion Surgery: Scleral expansion surgery involves the use of scle ral expansion band segments which are inserted beneath partial thickness sclera l incisions (scleral belt loops) in each of the obl ique quadrants. The procedure is claimed to improve accommodation a nd has been proposed as a treatment for presbyopia. The infrared laser has also been used to make deep scle ral incisions to treat presbyopia presumably by mec hanisms similar to scleral expansion bands (Kleinmann, et a l., 2006). According to the AAO, many investigators dispute the proposed mechanism of scleral expansion to trea t presbyopia, and the results of these various surg eries have not shown predictable or consistent effects on distance corrected near acuity or accommodative am plitude (AAO, 2017). There is insufficient evidence in the peer-reviewed literature to support the effectiveness of scleral expansion surgery for the treatment of presbyopia. The American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Fo undation Choosing Wisely \u00ae Initiative The American Academy of Ophthalmology stated \"Don't perform preoperative medical tests for eye surgery unless there are specific medical indications\" (rel eased February 21, 2013). Use Outside of the US The National Institute for Health and Clinical Exce llence (NICE) (United Kingdom) (2013) conducted a r eview of the evidence on photochemical corneal collagen cros s-linkage (CXL). According to NICE, the majority of the published evidence on the procedure using riboflavi n and ultraviolet A (UVA) for keratoconus and kerat ectasia relates to the 'epithelium off' technique. NICE stated that the current eviden ce on the safety and efficacy of epithelium-off CXL for keratoconus and keratectasia is adequate in quality and quantity. NICE found th e safety and efficacy evidence for epithelium-on CXL and the combination (CXL-plus) procedures to be of inadequ ate quantity and quality and therefore recommended that the procedures only be used with special arrangeme nts for clinical governance, consent and audit or research. The 2013 NICE guidance on corneal inlay implantatio n for correction of presbyopia stated that the evid ence was limited in quantity and quality and came predominan tly from case series. There was some evidence of ef ficacy in the short term. However, there were reports that ad verse effects occur frequently. Therefore the proce dure should only be used with special arrangements for c linical governance, consent and audit or research. NICE issued guidance on the use of corneal implants for the correction of refractive error, stating th at the available evidence on the efficacy of corneal impla nts for the correction of refractive error showed l imited and unpredictable benefit. In addition, NICE stated the re were concerns about the safety of the procedure for patients with refractive error which can be corrected by oth er means, such as spectacles, contact lenses, or la ser refractive surgery. Therefore, corneal implants sho uld not be used for the treatment of refractive err or in the absence of other ocular pathology such as keratocon us (NICE, 2007b). The NICE guidance on the use of corneal implants fo r the management of keratoconus stated that current evidence on the safety and efficacy of corneal impl ants for keratoconus appears adequate to support th e use of this procedure, provided that normal arrangements a re in place for consent, audit and clinical governa nce (NICE, 2007a). The 2006 NICE guidance on photorefractive laser sur gery for refractive errors supported the treatment in appropriately selected patients. Supported techniqu es included photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) and laser i n situ keratomileusis (LASIK) (NICE, 2006). In 2004, NICE issued guidance on the use of scleral expansion bands in which it was stated that the cu rrent evidence on the safety and efficacy of scleral expa nsion surgery for presbyopia is very limited. NICE found no Page 19 of 28 Medical Coverage Policy: 0141 evidence of efficacy in the majority of patients an d also noted that there were concerns about the pot ential risks of the procedure. It was recommended that the proce dure not be used (NICE, 2004).
