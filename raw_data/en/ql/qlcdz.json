Check out the Mauviel M'cook Stainless Steel Cookware set. https://sm.foodnutrimag.org/originalnontoxiccookingsolution %23foodnutrimag %23kitchentools) I had never used stainless-steel pans, so I was eager to try the Mauviel M'cook Stainless Steel Cookware set and see if it lived up to the great things I've read about cooking with stainless steel. But, I'll be honest, I also had heard some not-so-fun things about cleaning stainless steel. I was interested to see how easy or hard stainless steel is to clean. The Mauviel M'cook Stainless Steel Cookware Set comes with three heavy-duty pans and two lids that are dishwasher-safe and oven-safe up to 680 degrees Fahrenheit. The pans' handles are easy to grip, and each pan has pour-friendly edges that make transferring contents to other containers or plates easier and less messy than other pans. I tested the frying pan first because it's the type of pan I use most often. I started with no oil and preheated the pan, then I added chicken sausage and let it cook for several minutes. After a while, I noticed it was really starting to stick and smelled like it might be burning, so I added some avocado oil to the pan to help loosen and release the sausage from the pan, which worked almost immediately. First lesson learned: Always grease the pans. I then tried the same chicken sausage in the saut\u00e9 pan, this time with avocado oil already preheated in the pan. The sausage cooked perfectly and had a beautiful sear on the outside! I also made some brown rice in the saucepan, making sure not to salt the water before it was boiling, per the product description on the pans. I also made sure to use silicone and wooden utensils whenever cooking with these pans. Clean-up wasn't nearly as bad as I was anticipating. While these pans required more effort to scrub than my nonstick pans, it isn't something that would make me not want to use the pans. I used a standard sponge, warm water and dish soap. I also ran the saucepan through the dishwasher, and it came out just fine. Overall, the Mauviel M'cook Stainless Steel Cookware Set of high-quality pans and lids live up to the expectations set by the products' descriptions. Remember to grease the pans with oil or another fat prior to cooking, and don't be afraid of the clean-up \u2014 it's not bad at all! I recommend using these pans for any type of cooking, except for foods such as eggs or pancakes that would warrant using a nonstick pan. "}
