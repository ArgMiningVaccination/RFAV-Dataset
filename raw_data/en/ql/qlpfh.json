Offered in a group setting, once a week for an hour, w ellness Exchange provides clients with a safe environment where they can learn about prioritizing possibilities, building problem-solving skills, promoting positive activities, managing reactions, promoting helpful thinking, and building/rebuilding social connections, which are commonly lost when people experience homelessness. a new module is explored each week for six weeks and clients are encouraged to come to as many sessions they like. \"the first time I came to the w ellness Exchange, I was looking at things very negatively,\" says ramage, who admits he initially attended for the free coffee and muffins. \"but almost immediately, it reawakened better parts of my personality that I should have been showing and helped me to reorganize my thoughts and improve my coping skills.\" Program co-facilitator amanda Loates, a member of the aHs street Outreach and stabilization t eam, says the program is designed to support those individuals who don't necessarily require mental health intervention but need some support. \"Homelessness is traumatic and we're seeing that this model of care is resonating with clients who are often remiss about asking for help,\" Loates says. \"It's not always about getting people housed and treated, but about optimizing their functioning and ability to cope no matter where they're at. \"we're seeing many repeat clients in the wellness Exchange and we're building relationships with them that are encouraging them to reach out for further support.\"ramage credits the program for helping him secure housing after living on Calgary's streets for eight months. although he's completed the program several times, he continues to attend the group sessions. \"this is something I look forward to every week,\" he says. \"It's an hour where I can relax and say what's on my mind. sometimes I feel lonely and I feel unhappy with the things I've done. w ellness Exchange has helped me look at things differently.\" and his success has made a positive impact on staff and other clients. \"stephen is so engaged and his presence makes a big impact on other clients,\" says co-facilitator Jeff sturgeon, a social worker with urgent Mental Health. \"He understands the material and understands what resonates with people, so he often challenges us to present things differently to help make sure all of the participants are getting as much out of the program as he has.\" Joshua adams, a counsellor at the Drop-In Centre, says he and his colleagues are very proud of ramage's hard work and are pleased to see his life getting back on track. \"He's become more reflective and more intentional in the choices he makes,\" adams says, \"and it's changed his life.\" and ramage agrees. \"I've never been let down coming here and I'm going to continue coming back. w ellness Exchange has made me a better person.\" nStory and photos by Lisa Sutherland | LOATESAs one client says, 'It has made me a better person' DR. si D vine R BRenDA HUBAnD calgary Zone executive leadership team Once skeptical, Stephen Ramage now says the Wellness Exhange program has helped improve his copingskills.now is thE timE to mAkE your wishEs known Many of us save for a rainy day, plan for retirement, and plan our next vacation.

FMC serves patients from southern Alberta, southeastern B.C. and parts of Saskatchewan. The facility is an academic research centre and is integrated with the University of Calgary and Tom Baker Cancer Centre. It was built in 1966. It has a footprint of 83 acres. FMC holds approximately 1,100 inpatient beds. Working there are 15,000 staff, 1,800 physicians and 1,000 volunteers. It serves 700,000 outpatient visits annually. It is home to two state-of-the-art hybrid operating suites. \" our motto h As bEcom 'Proud PAst; h EAlthy Senior Operating Officer of FMC1965: Under construction to celebrate its golden anniversary, alberta's largest hospital pulled out all the stops with a week-long celebration June 16-22. Celebrations of foothills Medical Centre's (fMC) 50th anniversary kicked off with the opening of its time capsule, planted at the facility's entrance in 1966. Its historic gems included original site plans, news clippings and newspapers and the original staff roster. It also included an envelope containing 63 cents. \"there were about 3,500 people at the opening celebrations, and there was a lot of anticipation as we opened the metal time capsule with a blowtorch. w e were excited to see what our predecessors wanted to share with us,\" says Dr. Peter Jamieson, fMC's Medical Director. \"It offered a rare look into foothills' rich history.\" throughout the week, there were historic photo galleries and information displays on site, along with food trucks and free fitness classes for staff, physicians and the public. On June 18, approximately 300 foothills 'babies' gathered on the south hill outside the hospital for a historic group photo. Participants ranged in age from just a few days to 50 years old. Don Detomasi, the first baby to be born at fMC was also in attendance with his parents, wife and son. \"My mom kept telling me that's my one claim to fame,\" Detomasi says. \"It's great to be part of this history and this event.\" the celebrations got competitive on June 21 as staff went head-to-head in a site-wide 'amazing race.' t eams of two participated in 10 challenges in programs and areas across the site, including women's health, nutrition and food services, the intensive care unit, orthopedics, transplant, trauma, renal, burn, transition, and respiratory services. \"this amazing race event has been great for foothills, bringing people together from various services across the site, and really showcasing the spirit of fMC,\" says amanda w eiss, administrative Director of fMC. In the end, amy whitney and felicia thibault, both registered respiratory therapists, took first place, completing the amazing race foothills turns fifty edition in 54 minutes and 41 seconds. Celebrations ended on June 22 with closing ceremonies and a parade of more than 1,000 staff, physicians, volunteers and patients each representing their teams and departments. \"the parade gave the site a wonderful sense of pride and togetherness with so many employees and partnerships participating,\" says Carly Morrison, administrative co-ordinator at fMC. \"this was an opportunity to really shine and celebrate our accomplishments together.\" shawna syverson, senior Operating Officer of fMC agrees. \"Our staff and physicians have had a real impact on the community, both then and now,\" says syverson. \"a half-century is a milestone for the site and for Calgary.

In treatment, patients are given medications to intensively suppress the immune system in the week leading up to the stem cell transplant. On the day before the infusion of the healthy donor stem cells, they also undergo a low-dose total body irradiation, in final preparation. Compared to other stem cell transplant procedures, this conditioning has the fewest side effects with high success rates. It has been used with success in adults in the u.s. sickle cell anemia is a chronic illness in which blood cells can change into a sickle shape and block blood vessels. It varies in severity from patient to patient, but every organ is potentially at risk. strokes, lung disease, heart strain and damage to the spleen and bones can result. Even with the most advanced care available, life expectancy is 55-60 years. Many people with sickle cell anemia frequently visit the ED. genetically, one parent can pass on the mutation that causes sickle anemia without causing illness in their children, but if both parents pass it on, illness results. sickle cell anemia mainly affects those of african descent, but is occasionally found in other populations. Cardelia's older sister, t amika allen, proved to be a full match and provided the stem cells for transplant. the odds of a complete match (unaffected by sickle cell disease) being found within the family are only one in five. w ithout a family match, the transplant procedure is generally considered too risky to perform. \"when we learned I was a match there was never any question of whether or not I'd do it,\" says allen, now 22. \"Of course I'm going to do this for my sister. It was such a good feeling to be able to help make her life better - now I call her my mini-me.\" nStem cells offer new lease on life for kids with sickle cell anemia Story by Greg Harris | Photo by Paul Rotzinger Cardelia Fox, centre, and her sister Tamika Allen, meet with Dr. Greg Guilcher, an AHS oncologist who leads the sickle cell blood and marrow transplant program at Alberta Children's Hospital. i n n o v a t i o n s PAGE 5 For the latest health news updates in your zone, visit the AHS website. www.ahs.caa diagnosis of cancer can be devastating and the treatments that follow can take a toll on the body and mind. that journey is not easy, and it can be difficult to navigate. but for prostate cancer survivor Colin Cantlie, the key to getting through it all is attitude, education and participation. \"attitude is so important in your recovery,\" says Cantlie. \"If your attitude is to shut down, then your physical and emotional health may follow.\" CancerControl alberta (CCa) offers a way for patients to connect with other survivors and get practical tips and information about services available through a twice-yearly education event called Living Your best Life with Cancer and beyond (LYbL). run by the CCa t ransitions of Care Provincial Project t eam, the event is designed to support cancer survivors in living well with and beyond their diagnosis. LYbL sessions occur twice a year in Calgary and Edmonton and are open through video teleconference at all 17 cancer centres; it is the only outreach cancer education event in alberta that is available to the entire province. Cantlie was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014. after opting for a radical prostatectomy - an operation that removes the prostate gland and some of the surrounding tissue - he is currently in recovery and determined to get the most out of his life, even if it is one with cancer. \"You must have an attitude that helps you move forward with enthusiasm to help you get better and stay better,\" he says. Cantlie believes one of the best ways to cultivate a positive attitude is by having conversations, getting out there and being active. \"It's your body and your health; you need to know what's happening. You may not like the diagnosis but you can change a lot by your attitude and your approach and by learning something new about your cancer every day.\" amanda Jacques, Provincial Education specialist - survivorship, CCa, says each participating aHs cancer centre site creates a local live event with survivors, like Cantlie, who share their cancer story and answer questions. \"we want to give patients and families the ability to take the next steps and really empower them to live their best life despite having cancer,\" says Jacques. the events focus on tips that participants can take right away to live their best life by: adding movement or exercise into their day. Having a positive outlook. appreciating things that are good in their life. Learning how to minimize side effects. unlike many educational sessions and events, LYbL has been created for people with all types of cancer and stages of diagnosis, as well as cancer survivors. this uniqueness is what draws Cantlie in. \"although we do not all have the same form of cancer or the same outlook or prognosis, there is the common link between us that we are all survivors. w e do not all think the same, so to share our different stories with each other allows us to support each other in a unique way.\" LYbL events began four years ago and have drawn over 2,000 participants across alberta. the next LY bL event will be held Oct. 28 in Edmonton and will be offered provincewide through telehealth, sites to be confirmed. for more information about LY bL and other cancer support programs, visit www. albertahealthservices.ca/cancer/Page9613. aspx. n Story and photo by Kristin Bernhard | LIvIng YOur bEst LIfE wItH CanCEr anD bEYOnD Deb Allatt, AHS Lead, Provincial Patient Education, Patient Engagement and Supportive Care, left, joins patient Colin Cantlie and Amanda Jacques, Provincial Education Specialist - Survivorship, CancerControl Alberta, in the exercise facility at the Holy Cross Cancer Centre where Cantlie stays healthy following his cancer treatment.

I couldn't have been more wrong.My family had to immediately put together a funeral that honoured and reflected her while also meeting family and cultural expectations, and on a limited budget. that only extended the horror - all while chest-deep in grief. not an experience I'd wish on anyone.sparing loved ones such emotional trauma is the key reason to plan your own farewell service. \"It is a huge responsibility for the surviving family to create a meaningful celebration,\" says ray reitsema, funeral director and assistant manager at foster's garden Chapel in Calgary. \"If someone is able to have a frank discussion with loved ones prior to death, some stress is removed from a very difficult and emotional process.\" Prepayment can also eliminate or ease the financial burden. the alberta funeral service association estimates the average cost of a funeral in alberta is $4,500. You could save money by paying for the services you (hopefully) don't use until the distant future. One important step is deciding if you want to be buried, cremated or donated to medical science. If you don't want burial or cremation as part of the service, or even a traditional funeral at a church or chapel, you could have a memorial service either immediately or down the road. from there, you can decide on the details you want: who will officiate, music, slideshow, eulogies, obituaries, memorabilia, flowers, food, and your final resting place. It's a lot to consider, which is why it's ideal to plan ahead. \"I am a firm believer that the celebration of life should reflect the person,\" reitsema says. \"why have a church service for someone who has never attended church?\" with that in mind, you don't have to follow the norm. If you've always hosted the best parties, why not throw one final bash? If you love to travel, orchestrate a trip for your loved ones as a final celebration. If you're a music lover, host a live concert featuring your favourite music as your last hurrah. Customizing your final commemoration by sharing your interests, memories and talents is the perfect way for people to remember you. some folks hold a \"pre-funeral\" before they pass to spend time with family and friends and celebrate their life while still alive. whatever you decide, it will be all the more meaningful because you chose it. \"Even if the person has only prearranged the goods and services necessary, the surviving family has a much easier task than starting from the beginning,\" reitsema says. \"they are confident they are doing what their loved one wanted instead of guessing.\" Making your wishes known will help immensely, even if yours is not to have a final celebration. Had we had any hint of what my mom wanted, we wouldn't have been plagued by uncertainty throughout an already devastating experience. ultimately, it's better to have a painful conversation now to ease far greater pain down the road. nStory by Colleen Seto | Visit applemag.ca tAlkinG About thE 'f' word: funErAls WHAT TO DO WHen A lOVeD One DIeS a number of legal and financial obligations have to be looked after when someone dies.

Charles Hamel, despite more than 42 years' service with the Canadian forces and 1,000 days in combat, his toughest battle is the one he fought upon his return home from overseas duty. \"It's like we go from hero to zero,\" he says, \"where we had something to offer as capable soldiers in the field serving our country, to the home-front where we feel like a nobody with nothing to give. re-integration into civilian life was probably the hardest challenge.\" Hamel did a seven-month tour in the Congo in 2003-2004, and two tours in afghanistan, starting in 2005 and 2011. after his second afghanistan tour, he was diagnosed with operational stress injury (OsI), which includes PtsD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and major depressive disorder (MDD). He experiences sleep disorders, flashbacks, memory loss and more. \"I felt isolated when I came back because there really wasn't anybody I could talk to about some of the horrors I'd seen,\" says the 60-year-old Calgarian. \"there is an overpowering feeling of abandonment when you get home; like the army has forgotten about you and you aren't needed for anything anymore.\" Marney riendeau, manager of the Carewest Operational stress Injury Clinic, has known Hamel for years. \"OsIs are complex and it can be challenging to determine the exact causes or triggers,\" says riendeau. \"they are mental illnesses, which may include depression and anxiety, and require a carefully customized treatment plan through a combination of prescription medicine, cognitive treatment, physical activity and spiritual or emotional care. Common co- existing illnesses to OsIs are addictions. \"the illness affects anyone. Many cases of OsI affect our first responders, such as EMs and our police force. PtsD can also occur due to traumatic childhood experiences, which further complicate treatment.\" It's no surprise then that Hamel finds the physical activity part of his therapy so effective. \"It's satisfying to challenge yourself in a different kind of physical effort than what soldiering demands - and being with a peer group is an added benefit.\" so when fellow retired veteran barry ashton - who suffered from mild PtsD after his return from the former Yugoslavia in 1996 - suggested the buller Mountain summit for Mental Health and w ellness, Hamel instantly came on board. a major general with 35 years of service, ashton, 72, has seen and experienced the effects of OsIs. after hiking Mount buller last year, the Calgarian decided to organize a fundraising climb/hike on the mountain to raise awareness for mental illness, health and wellness. this year's climb took place on June 25 and raised $70,000, thanks to a partnership with the Calgary Health t rust, the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry foundation (PPCLI) and a major sponsor, atmosphere, an outdoor adventure store. the mountain is named for first world w ar hero Lt.-Col. Herbert Cecil buller, who died in battle in 1916. Climbers and hikers started the summit at the buller Mountain day use area, located near spray Lakes in Kananaskis Country. three teams and 27 individual climbers climbed the 2,805 m to the top of the mountain, while 16 hikers took a slightly gentler hike of 2,470 m to the summit of buller Pass. Each climbing team member pledged to raise $2,500, while hikers pledged to raise $1,500 for mental health and wellness. Mountaineer Laurie skreslet, the first Canadian to ascend Mount Everest in 1982, also took part. \"Climbing a mountain puts us in the moment and is an accomplishment that empowers and transforms us,\" says the 66-year-old. \"Challenging physical exercise reawakens our awareness and strength, and focuses us so we can recognize our capabilities and instil resiliency. I'm honoured to be part of this summit.\" as was Jill Olynyk, President and CEO of Calgary Health t rust. \"we are so proud to partner with the PPCLI foundation on this important initiative,\" says Olynyk. \"their support will make a big difference to individuals dealing with PtsD.\" for his part, Hamel remains optimistic about his own 'climb' back to mental health. \"Everyone has their own mountain to climb, and their own way of reaching the top,\" he says. \"It's just drawing the strength and courage to figure out how to make that journey that's the hard part.\" n aug18-27 GlobAlfEst the Calgary Health trust is hosting globalfest at Calgary's Elliston Park, featuring cultural pavilions from brazil, Chile, Mexico, the u.s. and Canada, and an incredible fireworks display.
