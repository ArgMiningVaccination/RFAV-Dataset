When [Dr. Tiffani Fries](https://saltlakecityutchiropractor.com/staff/dr-tiffani-fries-dc/) is presented with a subluxated spine, she will do an adjustment which can release toxins that have been trapped by the incorrect positioning of the spine. Once these toxins are released, they are flushed from the body by the lymphatic system. This triggers messages to be sent to the rest of the body to go ahead and get rid of the toxins. These toxins can prevent the body from functioning normally. Once they are released, the lymphatic system flushes the wastes out of the body. More detoxification might be necessary if the lymphatic system is also blocked. When you pursue detoxification from [Genesis Chiropractic](https://saltlakecityutchiropractor.com), you are looking for a total detoxification solution. In short, chiropractic detoxification is metabolic detoxification. You are literally detoxifying your body at a cellular level. What Can You Expect from Your Detoxification Program? Toxins are the reason that you may feel sick following a chiropractic adjustment. It is your body's response to them. The Detoxification process is a combination of adjustments to get your body back in balance, and nutrition counseling to keep the toxins away. Once you have completed Detoxification treatment, you will experience better health in every system in your body. You may find yourself feeling healthier than you have in years. Our detoxification program will teach you how to keep yourself in a metabolic balance that will keep you actively on a path to wellness.
