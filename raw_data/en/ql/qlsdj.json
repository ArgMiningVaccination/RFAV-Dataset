OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 2 A. GOALS OF THE BOP IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM 1. Screen inmates for indications for immunizations as defined in this BOP Immunization Clinical Guidance. 2. Administer vaccines based upon indications. 3. Decrease vaccine -preventable disease burden. 4. Prevent unintention al vaccination adverse effect s based upon health care provider knowledge of contraindications and precautions . 5. Store and handle vaccine in such a way that the \"cold chain\" is not interrupted. B. IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 1. OVERVIEW It is recom mended that each BOP facil ity (1) have an immunization program that is imple mented in conjunction with the Preventive Health P rogram ; (2) make a decision regarding when and by whom inmates will be screened and scheduled for needed vaccinations ; and (3) ensure that responsibility be assigned to health care personnel for patient assessment and vaccine administration. The following are possible interventions for facilitating implementation of the immunization program: Schedule preventive vaccines for administration during specific clinic visits when need for vaccine is noted (e.g. , history and physical, preventive health, chronic care clinics). Utilize a template (e.g. , during chronic care clinic) summarizing vaccine administration, for example: Last TST (PPD) Last influenza PCV13 (wait 1 year after PPSV23 , if PPSV 23 given first) PPSV23 (at least 8 weeks after P CV13) Tdap (one adult dose; one dose 3rd trimester of each pregnancy ) MM R (evidence of immunity ; otherwise 1 dose unless precaution or contraindicated) Hep A (series dates ) Hep B (series dates , immune status ) HPV (Female s: administer up to age 26; Males : administer up to age 21 or age 26 if MSM, HIV, or immunocompromised) MenACWY ( two dose series and one every 5 years for HIV, asplenia, complement disorder) MenB (Asplenia or complement d isorder ; Bexsero 2 -dose or Trumenba 3 -dose) Conduct active surveillance of administration of specific vaccines . Implement p erformance improvement projects related to the administrati on of specific vaccines . Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 3 2. BOP VACCINE INDICATION S A table summarizing i ndications for vaccination of BOP inmates is located in CHAPTER 2. BOP IMMUNIZATION INDICATIONS . These indications are based on ACIP guidelines , with modifications unique to the high ly mobile inmate population. A common challenge for BOP health -care providers is vaccinating adults with unknown vaccination histories . ACIP guidance for adult MMR and Td/Tdap vaccines assume s childhood vaccination history and recommends single booster doses of MMR and Tdap. (Tdap is also recommended for the third trimester of each pregnancy.) For HPV and pneumococcal vaccines , ACIP recommends taking into account self-reported history of vaccinations . These considerations ar e incorporated into CHAPTER 2. 3. USE OF VACCINE PROCEDURE MODULES CHAPTER 3. VACCINATION PROCEDURE MODULES cover the following elements for each vaccine : indications, contraindications, precautions, dose, route, site, and documentation instructions. It is recommended that the Infection Prevention & Control Committee and Governing Body first review how the immunization program will be implemented. Then , Clinical Directors can authorize specific categories of health care personnel, within their scope of practice, to administer vaccines using the Vaccine Procedure Modules \u2014instead of writing individual patient orders. Personnel authorized to administer vaccine should have demonstrated vaccine administration skills. A signature sheet template, located at th e beginning of CHAPTER 3, includes check boxes to indicate which vaccine modules are permitted to be used and which categories of providers are authorized to use the m. It is recommended that the timing of updates to the signature sheet coincide with the timing of other nursing protocols and when these vaccine procedure modules are updated. The influenza vaccine module will be updated annually by the Health Services Division . Guidance in the modules is based on the ACIP Adult Immunization Schedule for persons age 19 years or older . For patients age 18 or younger , consult the package insert and local pharmacist. 4. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER EDUCATION It is recommended that healthcare workers who are respons ible for administration of vaccinations be ed ucated at initial orientation and when ever vaccines or vaccine procedures change. The following Chapter s can be used f or health care worker education: CHAPTER 3. VACCINE MODULE S, covers indications , contraindication s, precautions, routes of administration, reporting adverse effects , and documentation of vaccines. CHAPTER 4. ADMINISTERING VACCINES : DOSE, ROUTE , SITE, AND NEEDLE SIZE is useful as a reference tool for vaccine administration . The SKILL S CHECKLIST FOR VACCINE ADMINISTRATION is available in Attachment 1 . (list for Health Care Provider Education continues on next page) Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 4 Additional training resources can be found below in this chapter , under D. RESOURCES FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER VACCINE EDUCATION . Vaccine Information Statements (VISs), which provide vaccine -specific information for provider s and patient s, are available from the CDC See link under 5. PATIENT EDUCATION below . 5. PATIENT EDUCATION Discussion of the benefits and risks of vaccination is sound medical practice and is required by federal law. Patients should be informed about the benefits and risks associated with vaccines in a language the patient understands and at an appropriate educ ational level. An o pportunity to ask questions should be provided before each vaccination. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires that VISs be provided to patients each time a vaccine dose is administered. Copies of VISs are available from the CDC at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/index.html or by navigating to the CDC website within the vaccine consent in BEMR medical forms . Translations of VISs into languages other than English are available from the Immunization Action C oalition website at http://www.immunize.org . 6. SAFE VACCINE ADMINISTRATION While life -threatening reactions to vaccines are extr emely rare, it is recommended w hen administering vaccines that epinephrine and equipment for managing an airway be available for immediate use in the case of a severe anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine. Persons administering vaccines should be familiar wit h identifying severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and be competent in responding to t hese events . See C.4. PREVENTING AND MANAGING ADVERSE REACTIONS below . 7. INFECTION CONTROL The following are CDC recommended infection control guidelines related to vaccine administration: Clean h ands either with an alcohol -based hand rub or with soap and water both before preparing vaccines for administration and between patient contacts. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations do not require gloves to be worn when administering vaccinations, unless persons administering vaccinations have open lesions on their hands or are likely to come into contact with a patient's body fluids. If gloves are worn , change gloves in-between patients , with hand hygiene performed each time gloves are removed . Draw up vaccines in a designated clean medication area that is not adjacent to areas where potentially contaminated items are placed. Do not keep or access m ulti-dose vials in the immediate patient treatment area to pre vent inadvertent contamination of the vial through direct or indirect contact with potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment . (list for Infection Control continues on next page) Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 5 Cleanse the access diaphragms of medication vials with 70% alcohol before inserting a device (needle) into the vial. Do not administer vaccines from single -dose vials to more than one patient. Do not mix vaccines in the same syringe unless they are spec ifically licensed for such use . Single -dose vials and manufacturer -filled syringes are designed for single -dose administration ; discard them if vaccine has been withdrawn or reconstituted . Syringes that are prefilled by the manufacturer and activated (i.e ., syringe cap removed or needle attached) but not used , are to be discarded at the end of the clinic day. The routine practice of providers prefilling syringes is discouraged . Prefilling might result in administration errors if syringes are not labeled . In certain circumstances when a single vaccine type is being used (e.g., in preparation for a mass influenza vaccination ), filling a small number of syringes may be considered (i.e., the contents of one multi -dose vial) . Individually label p re-filled syr inges or place them in a labeled tray and store them at the proper temperature. Administer doses as soon as possible after filling \u2014by the same person who filled the syringes. Discard u nused p refilled syringes if not used the same day that they are fille d. Prevent needle stick injurie s. Immediately place u sed needles and syringes into a sharps container following administration . Do not recap needles. For more information, see https://www.c dc.gov/injectionsafety/providers.html . 8. VACCINE STORAGE AND HANDLING Failure to adhere to recommended specifications for storage and handling of vaccines can reduce or destroy their potency, resulting in no or inadequate immune response in the recipient and poor protection against disease. It is critically important that the vaccine \"cold chain\" be maintained to assure that the vaccine retains its potency . (An unbroken \"cold chain \" is an uninterrupted series of storage and distribution activities that maintain a given temperature range. ) It is recommended that each facility designate a primary vaccine coordinator who is responsible for oversight of vaccine acquisiti on and storage to assure the \"cold chain\" is not interrupted. It is also recommended that l ocal standard operating procedures for vaccine storage and handling be developed based upon the guidance in Chapter 5. Vaccine Storage and Handling , including managing after -hours emergencies. Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 6 C. SUMMARY OF ACIP IMMUNIZATION BEST PRACTICE S GUIDANC E Health care providers must navigate a number of issues when vaccinating patients , including the screening for contraindications and precautions, timing of each dose, the number o f vaccines to be administered, and interpreting and responding to adverse events. Key sections of the 2017 ACIP guidelines are summarized below to provide information for health care providers about concerns that commonly arise when vaccinating patients . The full text of the ACIP available https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip AND PRECAUTIONS 1.A. INTRODUCTION Contraindications and precautions to vaccination generally dictate circumstances when vaccines should not be given. The majority of contraindications and precautions are temporary, and the vaccine can be given at a later time. Contraindications and prec autions for each vaccine are listed in each BOP vaccine module. They are based upon the ACIP Adult Combined . CONTRAINDICATIONS are conditions that increase the risk for a serious adverse reaction to a vaccine in a person with that condition . In general , a vaccine should not be given if a patient has a contraindication condition. PRECAUTIONS are condition s that might increase the risk for a serious adverse reaction, might cause diagnostic confusion, or might compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity . In general, vacci nations should be deferred when a precaution is present unless the benefit of protection from the vaccine outweighs the risk of an adverse reaction. SCREENING QUESTIONS FOR VACCINES Prior to vaccine administration, screen patients for contraindications and precautions . The key to preventing serious adverse reactions is screening. Effective screening is not difficult or complicated and can be accomplished with just a few questions depending on the precautions and contraindications for the vaccine being administered. Routine physical examinations and procedures (e.g., measuring temperatures) are not prerequisites for vaccinating persons who appear to be healthy. Examples of screening questions include: Are you sick today? Do you have allergies to medications, food , or any vaccine? Have you had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? Can you eat eggs? Have you had a seizure, brain , or nerve problem? (list of examples contin ues on next page) Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 7 Do you have a health problem such as asthma, lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, or a metabolic disease such as diabetes or a blood disorder? Do you have cancer, leukemia, HIV , or any other immune system problem? In the past 3 mo nths , have you taken cortisone, prednisone, other steroids , or anticancer drugs , or have you had x -ray treatments? Have you received a transfusion of blood or blood product , or been given a medicine called immune globulin in the past year? Are you pregnant or is there a chance you will be pregnant in the next month? Have you received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? A sample screening checklist is available at : http://immunize.org/catg.d/p4065.pdf INVALID CONTRAINDICATIONS TO VACCINATION Mild illness Allergies that are not anaphylactic or allergies to products not in the vaccine Antimicrobial therapy Disease exposure or convalescence Having a p regnant or immunosuppressed person in the household Fami ly history of adverse events Multiple vaccines 1.B. PERMANENT CONTRAINDICATIONS Severe (anaphylactic) allergic reaction to a vaccine (including influenza vaccine) . Examples of symptoms and signs typical of anaphylactic reactions include : generalized urti caria (hives), swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, wheezing, hypotension, or shock. Severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose of vaccine , e.g., anaphylactic reaction to gelatin in MMR vaccine . Encephalopathy not due to another identifiable cause , within 7 days of receipt of vaccine . 1.C. TEMPORARY CONTRAINDICATIONS OR PRECAUTIONS Pregnancy: Live vaccine and some non -live vaccines are contrai ndicated during pregnancy (e.g. , MMR, Z VL VAR, RZV, HPV) because of the theoretical risk to the fetus . Immunosuppression: Live vaccines (e.g., MMR and VAR) are contraindicated in persons with immunosuppression . EXAMPLES : Hematologic and solid tumors, chemotherapy, congenital immunodeficiency or long - term immunosuppressive therapy (20 mg or more of prednisone or equivalent for two or more weeks) , and HIV infection in patients who are severe ly immunocompromised ( CD4+ T -cell count <200 cells/mm3). Live vaccine is deferred for at least 1 month after discontinu ation of steroid therapy . Moderate or severe acute illness: Vaccination should be deferred for persons with a moderate or severe acute illness . Persons receiving immune globulin preparations or blood products may need to defer MMR and VAR vaccines for a period of 3 -11 months (see SECTION 2.E. below ). Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 8 1.D. EGG ALLERGIES Severe allergic and anaphylactic reactions can oc cur in response to a number of vaccine components, including egg protein , although such reactions are rare. The most common animal protein allergen is egg protein , which is found in vaccines such as many influenza vaccines that are prepared using embryona ted chicken eggs . Of the influenza vaccines, a ll but RIV may co ntain egg protei n. Ordinarily, a person who can eat eg gs or egg products can receive vaccin es that contain egg. It is recommended that p ersons with histories of anaphylactic or anaphylactic -like allergy to eggs or egg proteins be further evaluated. A reasonable way to screen for those who might be at risk fr om egg - containing influenza vaccine is to ask people if they can eat eggs without adverse effects. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FLU VACCINATION OF PERSONS WITH EGG ALLERGY Hives only: Those with an e gg allergy history who have only experienced hives c an receive the flu vaccine (any form of IIV or RIV) appropriate for their age and health status. Anaphylactic allergy to eggs: Those with an egg allergy history involving angioedema, respiratory distress, lighth eadedness, or recurrent emesis or who require d epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention , may receive the flu vaccine (any form of IIV or RIV) appropriate for their age and health status , using the following special precautions : The vaccine should be administered in a medical setting an d be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions. The patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes for signs of a reaction after each dose of flu vaccine. 1.E. LATEX ALLERGY Contact allergy to latex: The most common type of latex hypersensitivity is a delayed -type, allergic contact dermatitis . Patients with a history of a contact allergy to latex can receive vaccines if they are contained in vials or syringes that contain dry natural rubber or natural rubber latex . Anaphylactic allergy to latex: In general, i f a person reports a severe anaphylactic allergy to latex, do not administer vaccine supplied in vials or syringes that contain natural rubber latex. If vaccine is deemed beneficial de spite risk of an allergic reaction, providers should be prepared to treat allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. 1.F. HISTORY OF ALLERGY TO OTHER SUBSTANCES Consult the patient's healthcare provider if there is a prior history of al lergic reactions to any added subs tances in vaccines. Additives used in the production of vaccines may include : Suspending fluid (e.g. , sterile water, saline , or fluids containing protein). Preservatives and stabilizers to help the vaccine remain unchanged (e.g. , albumin, phenols, and glycine). Adjuvants or enhancers to help the vaccine to be more effective , including gelatin, antimicrobial agents, thimerosal, and aluminum. Gelatin: Persons who have had an anaphylactic reaction to gelatin or gelatin -containing products sho uld be evaluated by an allergist prior to receivin g gelatin -containing vaccines. Example vaccines: VAR, MMR , ZVL Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 9 Antimicrobial Agents: Certain vaccines contain trace am ounts of antimicrobial agents, i.e., neomycin. A llergies to these s ubstances are rare. Usually is added to certain vaccines as a pres ervative. Reactions to thimerosal have been described as local, delayed -type hypersensitivity reactions with only rare reports of immediate reactions . A local or delayed - type hypersensitivity reaction to thimerosal is not a contraindication to receiving vaccine is sometimes a dded as adjuvant to help the vaccine stimulate a better or more persistent immune response to a vaccine. Example vaccines: Bexsero \u00ae (MenB), Td, Tdap ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON VACCINE COMPONENTS An extensive list of vaccine components and their use, as well as the vaccines that contain each component is available from the CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac -gen/additives.htm Additional information and tables of potential allergens in different vaccines are available at http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/components -Allergens.htm . The allergens identified in the patient's history can be cross -checked against the allergens identified in package inserts. 2. TIMIN G AND SPACING OF VACCINATIONS 2.A. AGE Recommendations for the age at which vaccines are administered are influenced by age -specific risks for disease, age -specific risks for complications , and age-specific responses to vaccine . Age-specific immunization indicat ions are noted in the vaccine package inserts , in CHAPTER 2, and in the individual vaccine module s in CHAPTER 3. 2.B. INTERVALS FOR MULTI DOSE VACCINES It is recommended that h ealth care providers follow the CDC guidelines for the recommended intervals between vaccine doses . See the CDC vaccine schedules at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html . For most BOP inmates, see the adult immunization, full version. Vaccines should be administered as close as possible to the recommended dosing interval s. However, if a vaccine schedule is lapsed, increasing the interval between doses of a multi -dose vaccine generally does not diminish t he ef fectiveness of a vaccine series. Thus, it is usually not necessary to restart the vaccine series if a dose is given late ; instead, when the laps ed schedule is identified, simply complete the vaccine series. Example: If two Hepatitis B vaccine doses were given a month apart one yea r ago, do not restart the series. Complete the thi rd hepatitis B vaccine dose and, if indicated, obtain a titer for surface antibody one to two months later. Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 10 In certain situations, it may be necessary to administer multi -dose vaccines at shorter intervals between doses than is typically recommended, i.e., when a person is behind schedule on vaccinations , but needs rapid protection. In these situations, an accelerated schedule can be considered utilizing the vacci ne package insert. 2.C. SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF DIFFERENT VACCINES Simultaneous administration of vaccines is defined as administering more than one vaccine on the same clinic day, at different anatomic sites, and not combined in the same syringe. With some exceptions, it is safe and a cceptable to simultaneously administer the most widely used live an d inactivated vaccin es. There are two exceptions to this rule: The pneumococcal vaccines (PCV13 and PPSV23) should not be administered simultaneously . See the Pneumococcal Vaccine module in CHAPTER 3 for guidance . MenACWY (Menactra) and PCV13 should not be administered simultaneously; PCV13 should be administered first and MenACWY (Menactra) administered 4 weeks later. Note : This warning does NOT apply to MenACWY (Menv eo). 2.D. SPACIN G OF MULTIPLE LIVE VACCINES In general, two or more live vaccines are not administered on the same day and should be separated by at least 28 days to minimize the poten tial risk for interference. When a live injectable vaccine (e.g. , MMR or VAR) or a live attenuated influenza virus ( LAIV ) is to be administered, providers should ensure that no live injectable or intranasal vaccine s have been given in the previous 28 days. If two different live vaccines a re administered , and they have been separated by less than 28 days , the second vaccine dose should not be counted , and another dose of the second vaccine should be given at least 28 days after the first dose. 2.E. SPACING OF LIVE VACCINES AND ANTIBODY -CONTAINING BLOOD PRODUCTS Blood (e.g., whole blood, packed red blood cells, plasma) and other antibody -containing blood products (e.g., immune globulin ) can inhibit the immune response to MMR (and possibly VAR) vaccine for up to 3 to 11 months , depending on the product and dos e. Providers should screen potential recipients of live vaccines for recent history of receipt of blood products. See Tables 3-4 and 3 -5, beginning on page 34 of the ACIP guidelines, for recommended intervals: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip -recs/general -recs/downloads/general -recs.pdf If a dose of MMR or VAR vaccine is administered following receipt of a blood product , at a shorter than recommended interval , then that vaccine dose should be repeated (unless serolog ic testing indicates a response to the vaccine ). The repeat vaccine dose (or serologic testing) should be performed after the CDC-recommended interval indicated for th at specific a ntibody -containing product . Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 11 2.F. SPACING OF TUBERCULIN SKIN TESTING (TST) OR OTHER ASSAYS AND LIVE VACCINES A TST may be administered on the same day as live vaccines (e.g., MMR or VAR), or the TST should be deferre d for 28 days after vaccination for MMR and 6 weeks after VAR. These TST guidelines also apply to obtaining interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) such as T -Spot\u00ae or QuantiFERON 3.A. ALTE and as primary or secondary: Primary immunodeficienc y generally is inherited and include s conditions defined by an inherent abse nce or quantitative deficiency of the cellular or humoral components (or both) that normally provide immunity. Secondary immunodeficiency is acquired. It is defined by loss or qualitative deficiency in cellular or humoral immune components that occurs as a result of a disease process or its therapy. Examples include HIV infection, hematopoietic malignancies, treatment with radiation or chemotherapy, and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. Certain conditions like asplenia and chronic renal disease also can cause altered immunocompetence. Administration of live vaccines may need to be deferred until immune function has improved. This is primarily a safety concern, because persons with altered immunocompetence who receive live vaccines might be at increase d risk for an adverse reaction due to uninhibited growth of the attenuated live virus or bacteria. Vaccines also might be less effective during the period of altered immunocompetence. Vaccination during chemotherapy or radiation should generally be avoided EXCEPT for influenza vaccination. The reason for this is that the antibody response might be suboptimal. Patients vaccinated within a 14 -day period before starting immunosuppressive therapy, or vaccinated while receiving immunosuppressive therapy, should be considered unimmunized. They should be revaccinated at least 3 months after therapy is discontinued , if immune competence has been restored . Vaccinations recommended because of immunosuppression : Pneumococcal vaccine: Persons with altered immunocompetence generally are recommended to receive polysaccharide -based vaccines (PCV13, PPSV23 ), on the basis of increased risk for di sease . See the P neumococcal Vaccine module in CHAPTER 3 for guidance . Meningococcal vaccines: These vaccines are recommended for persons with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease). See the Meningococcal Vaccine module in CHAPTER 3 for guidance . Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 12 3.B. ANTIVIRAL DRUGS Antiviral drugs used for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza virus infections have no effect on the response to inactivated influenza vaccin e. Live, attenuated influenza (intranasal) vaccine should NOT be administered until 48 hours after cessation of th erapy with antiviral influenza drugs . Antiviral drugs active against herpes viruses (e.g., acyclovir or valacyclovir) might reduce efficacy of vaccines containing live, attenuated varicella zoster virus. Ideally, these drugs should be discontinued at least 24 hours before administration of VAR and ZVL, and held for 14 days after the receipt of VAR and ZVL. 3.C. PREGNANCY No evidence exists of risk to the fetus from vaccinating pregnant women with inactivated virus or bacterial vaccines , or toxoids . HPV v accine, an inactivated vaccine, is NOT recommended during pregnancy, despite the lack of evidence of risk. Live vaccines pose a theoretical risk to the fetus. Therefore, live, attenuated virus and live bacterial vaccines ( i.e., MMR, VAR, ZLV ) generally are contraindicated during pregnancy. Women should avoid conception for 4 weeks after vaccination with MMR and 12 weeks after vaccination with VAR. Tdap vaccine is recommended for all pregnant women during EVERY pregnancy. Pregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap for the prevention of infant pertussis , whether or not they have previously received a dose of Tdap . Vaccination of the mother gener ates antibodies that pass transplacentally to the fetus . Vaccination in the third trimester optimizes the duration of this antibody protection for the baby after birth. Post -partum w omen for whom follow -up Td vaccination is indicated, but who did not complete the recommended 3-dose series during pregnancy , should receive follow -up after delivery to ensure that the series is completed. The inactivated influenza vaccine ( IIV) is recommended for all women who are or will be pregnant (in any trimester) during influenza season. Pregnant women are at increased risk of influenza complications. The HepB vaccine is not contraindicated in pregnancy and should be given to a pregnant woman for whom it is indicated . The HepA , pneumococcal , and meningococcal vaccines should be considered for pregnant women at incre ased risk for those infections . 3.D. HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANT (HCT) RECIPIENTS HCT is the infusion of hematopoietic cells from a donor into a patient who has received chemotherapy and often radiation. HCT recipients are at increased risk for certain vaccine - preventable diseases. As a result, HCT recipi ents should be routinely revaccinat ed after HCT. The timing of va ccination of HCT recipients is recommended as follows: Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) : At least 6 months post -transplant , and mo nths post - transplant . MMR and VAR vaccines : At least 24 months post -transplant , only if immunocompetent . Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 13 4. MANAGING ADVERSE REACTIONS A vaccine adverse event is an untoward event , which occurs after immunization , and that might be caused by the vaccine product or the vaccination process itself. These events range from common, minor local reactions to rare , severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis). Adverse reactions are also called side effects and are classif ied as local , systemic , or allergic . More complete information about adverse reactions to a specific vaccine is available in the package insert for each vaccine and from the CDC at : http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac -gen/side -effects.htm . A two-page handout on emergency medical management of anaphylactic reactions after vaccines is available at : http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/ p3082.pdf . 4.A. LOCAL ADVERSE REACTION S Most common Usually mild and self -limited Occur within a few hours of injection Common symptoms: Slight bleeding, pain, swelling, itching , and redness at injection site 4.B. SYSTEMIC ADVERSE REACTIONS More generalized than local reactions and may be unrelated to vaccine Common symptoms : fever, malaise, headache , and syncope Preventing and Managing Syncope: Syncope (vasovagal or vasodepressor reaction) can occur after vaccination and is most common among adolescents and young adults. When vaccinating persons with a history of syncope, have them sit or lie down for vaccination. C onsider observing patients (with patients seated or lying down) for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk for i njury should they faint. If syncope develops, patients should be assessed for injury and treated appropriately , or observed until the symptoms resolve. 4.C. SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTIONS Severe allergic reactions a re a commo n concern for the vaccine provider , although they are very rare. Anaphyla ctic reactions occur at a rate of approximatel y one per million doses for most vaccines. The best practice to prevent allergic reactions is to carefully screen individuals at increased risk by obtaining a history of allergy to previous vaccinations and vaccine components that might indicate an underlying hypersensitivity When administering vaccines, epinephrine and equipment for managing an airway should be available for immediate use in the case of a severe anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine. Epinephrine is available as an aqueous 1:1000 (i.e., 1 EpiPen and Auvi -Q). Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 1. OVERVIEW AND KEY PRINCIPLES , Page 14 4.D. REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AFTER VACCINATION Mandated reporting : If an adverse event occurs after vaccination, it should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ). Health -care providers are required to report certain events as described on the VAERS website a t: https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html . In addition to the mandated reporting of events listed on the reportable events table, health care personnel should report to VAERS all events listed in product package inserts as contraindications, as well as all clinically significant adverse events, even if they are uncertain that the adve rse event is related causally to vaccination . Information needed for VAERS report: Patient information (age, date of birth, sex) Vaccine information (brand name, dosage) Date, time, and location administered Date and time when adverse event(s) started Symptoms and outcome of the adverse event(s) Medical tests and laboratory results (if applicable) Physician's contact information (if applicable) There are 2 ways to report to VAERS: Submit the report online via a secure website at : https://vaers.hhs.gov/esub/index.jsp .

Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 3, MODULE 10. VARICELLA VACCINE , Page 1 MODULE 10. VARICELLA VACCINE A. Purpose The purpose of this guidance is t o reduce morbidity and mortality from varicella infection by vaccinating adults who meet the criteria established by the Bureau of Prisons ( BOP ), with guidance from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac tices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The full text of the ACIP guidelines is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/ acip-recs/general -recs/downloads/general -recs.pdf B. Procedure Using this vaccine module, eligible nurses and other healthcare professionals , as defined by scope of duty , may vaccinate adults who meet the indications below for the varicella live vaccine (VAR) . Request the vaccine through the non -formulary process. It is only administered rarely, on a case - by-case basis , in varicella exposure situations, after consultation with Regional/Central Office. Vaccine must remain FROZEN (at 58\u00b0F to +5\u00b0F; 50\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C until it is administered. Vaccine should not be ordered until a plan is in place for freezing it at these temperatures or administering immediately upon receipt of vaccine. 1. Indication: The patient has been exposed to varicella , without evidence of varicella immunity , and a determination has been made in consultation with the Regional/Central Office that varicella vaccination is indicated. The v accine is 70-100% effective if given within 3 days (possibly 5 days) of expo sure. The v accine will not prevent varicella infection if administered more than 5 days after exposure, but will still produce immunity if recipient does not become infected from this exposure . Obtain non -formulary approval through the non -formulary process. 2. Screen patients for CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS . VAR is a live attenuated varicella virus vaccine. CONTRAINDICATIONS : Do NOT give varicella vaccine to a person who has experien ced a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of the vaccine or to any of its components (e.g., neomycin or gelatin). For information on vaccine components, refer to the manufacturer's package insert at http://www.immunize.org/fda/ or go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient -table -2.pdf . Do NOT give varicella vaccine in the following situations: Pregnant females: Do not give varicella vaccine to pregnant females. In addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months following vaccination (vaccinate upon completion or termination of pregnancy). Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 3, MODULE 10. VARICELLA VACCINE , Page 2 Individuals with any malignant condition , including blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems. Individuals receiving high -dose systemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., tw o weeks or more of daily receipt of 20 mg [or 2 mg/kg body weight] of prednisone or equivalent). Individuals with HIV and a CD4+ T -lymphocytes count <200 cells/L . Family history of altered immunocompetence . PRECAUTIONS : Defer vaccination in the following situations: For up to 11 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or administration of immune globulins (IG); see package insert for specific recommendations . For 24 hours after administration of specific antivirals (i.e., acyclovir, famcic lovir, or valacyclovir); avoid use of these antiviral drugs for 14 days after vaccination. For moderate or severe acute illness, with or without fever. For individuals with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency until the i ndividual' s immune status is shown to be immunocompetent. Simultaneous vaccinations and procedures: Perform tuberculin skin testing (TST) prior to or on the same day as varicella vaccine, OR wait to perform TST until at least 6 weeks after varicella vaccination ; live virus vaccines may cause a temporary depression of TST sensitivity, leading to false negative results. If needed, administer varicella and MMR vaccines at the same visit ; otherwise, separate vaccines by at least 4 weeks. Varicella vaccine may be admi nistered simultaneously with other vaccines, but at separate sites at least 1 inch apart, with separate syringes and needles. 3. Provide all patients with a copy of the most current Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). Review the vaccination information w ith the patient and have the patient sign the immunization consent or declination form (BP -A0808). Provide non -English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if available and preferred by the patient . The current VIS, in Engl ish and other languages, can be found linked to vaccine consent forms in BEMR or at www.immunize.org/vis . 4. Safe handling and use of the varicella vaccine (VARIVAX\u00ae): Before reconstitution, store the lyophilized (freeze -dried) to 15\u00b0C) . After reconstitution, the lyophilized vaccine be stored in a refrigerator (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F; 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) for up to 72 continuous hours . Discard the lyophilized vaccine if not used within 72 hours after removal from freezer . The vial of diluent (sterile water) should be stored separately from the lyophilized vaccine, at room temperature (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F, 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C), or in the refrigerator. Before reconstitution, protect the lyophilized vaccine from light. Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 3, MODULE 10. VARICELLA VACCINE , Page 3 To reconstitute the vaccine , first withdraw the total volume of provided sterile diluent into a syringe (use only the sterile diluent supplied with VARIVAX) Inject all of the withdrawn diluent into the vial of lyophilized vaccine and gently agitate to mix thoroughly. VARIVAX, when reconstituted, is a clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid. Injection: Withdraw the entire contents into the syringe and inject the total volume (approximatel y 0.5 mL) of reconstituted vaccine subcutaneously. DISCARD the reconstituted vaccine if it is not used WITHIN 30 MINUTES . Do NOT freeze the reconstituted vaccine. For further product information, call 1 -800-9-VARIVAX (1 -800-982-7482). 5.

Tricep Deltoid Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 5. STORAGE AND HANDLING OF VACCINES , Page 1 CHAPTER 5. STORAGE AND HANDLING OF VACCINES Proper vaccine storage and handling is an important factor in preventing and eradicating many common vaccine -preventable diseases. Failure to adhere to recommended specifications for storage and handling of vaccines can reduce or destroy their potency, resulting in no or inadequate immune response in the re cipient and poor protection against disease. For a comprehensive guide on this subject, see the CDC's online Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit , available at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/index.html . A PDF version of the Toolkit is available from the website, or directly at the following link: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage -handling -toolkit.pdf For more information on vaccine storage and handling , see STEP 3 in Vaccinating Adults: Guide at: http://www.immunize.org/guide/pdfs/vacc -adults -step3.pdf . The following Attachments are designed to assist BOP institutions with internal communication regarding vaccine storage, hand ling, and temperature monitoring: Attachment 2 . Worksheets for Vaccine Storage and Handling Attachment 3 . Handling a Temperature Excursion in Your Vaccine Storage Unit (poster) Attachment 4 . Vaccine Refrigerator Temperature Log A. Developing Storage and Handling Procedures 1. Designate PRIMARY VACCINE COOR DINATOR (S) for the facility , includ ing coverage for after -hours emergencies. 2. Develop storage and handling plans and STANDARD OPERATING P ROCEDURES (SOP S) to serve as a reference and training tool for vaccine management and after hour emergencies. SOPs guide procedures and provide guidance for identifying, reporting , and correcting problems related to vaccine storage and handling. To assess current vaccine storage and handling, see the Checklist for Safe Vaccine Storage and Handling at: http://www.immunize. org/catg.d/p3035.pdf . 3. Develop a plan for vaccine delivery. Maintenance of vaccine quality is the shared responsibility of all handlers of vaccines from the time a vaccine is manufactured until administration. Individuals who receive vaccine deliveries need to be educated regarding the importance of immediate vaccine inspection and cold chain maintenance. All vaccines should be inspected on delivery: Check the cold chain maintenance for any indication of a TEMPERATURE EXCURSIO N (out -of- range temperatur e) during transit . Check that vaccines come with proper diluents . Check expiration dates . Add vaccine into inventory . Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 5. STORAGE AND HANDLING OF VACCINES , Page 2 B. Us ing Appropriate Vaccine Storage Units Vaccines licensed for REFRIGERATOR STORAGE should be stored at 36\u00b0F through 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C through 8\u00b0C). Vaccines licensed for FREEZER STORAGE (e.g., for varicella vaccine ) should be stored at -58\u00b0F through 5\u00b0F ( -50\u00b0C through -15\u00b0C) . The CDC makes the following recommendations regarding vaccine storage units: 1. The preferred type of vaccine storage unit is a PURPOSE -BUILT (pharmaceutical grade) unit designed to either refrigerate or freeze . These units can be either compact, under -the-counter - style , or large units. Purpose -built units have microprocessor -based temperature controls , with a digital temperature sensor and fan -forced air circulation to promote uniform temperature. Water bottles can be used, if necessary to stabilize temperatures. Check manufacturer guidance for use of water bottles with specific refrigerator or freezer. Use safeguards to ensure the doors of the unit remain closed ( e.g., self -closing door hinges, door alarms, door locks, etc.). 2. If a purpose -built unit is not available, use a stand -alone HOUSEHOLD -GRADE unit and follow the special instructions and considerations below. Do NOT under ANY circumstances store any vaccine in a dormitory -style or bar -style combined refrigerator/freezer unit. These units have a single exterior door and an evaporator plate/coolin g coil, usually located in an icemaker/freezer compartment , and have been shown to pose a significant risk of freezing vaccines . If the unit is a combination refrigerator/freezer , use ONLY the refrigerator compartment for storing refrigerated vaccines. Do NOT use the freezer compartment for any reason, but do NOT turn the freezer off. Note that household -grade units have cold spots and temperature fluctuations, and air circulating from the freezer could expose refrigerated vaccines to freezing tempera tures. However, do NOT turn the freezer off. Use only a separate stand -alone freezer to store frozen vaccines. Do not store frozen vaccines in the freezer portion of a combination refrigerator/freezer. Remove any deli, fruit, and vegetable drawers from th e household refrigerator units. This prevents the drawers from being used for storing food, beverages, or vaccines . It also provides more space for placing water bottles to help maintain stable temperatures (see next bullet) . If using a household -grade uni t\u2014either the refrigerator section of a combination refrigerator -freezer or a stand -alone (freezerless ) refrigerator \u2014placing filled water bottles against the walls, in the back, on the floor , and in the door racks is recommended to help stabilize temperatures if the refrigerator door is open for long periods or there is a loss of power. Label all water bottles: \"DO NOT DRINK !\" Use safeguards to ensure the doors of the unit remain closed ( e.g., self -closing door hinges, door alar ms, door locks, etc.). Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 5. STORAGE AND HANDLING OF VACCINES , Page 3 C. Using Vaccine Storage Best Practices 1. Store vaccines in their original packaging , with lids closed to protect them from light . 2. Whenever possible, store diluent with the corresponding refrigerated vaccine. Never store any diluent in a freezer. 3. Attach labels to shelves and containers to clearly identify vaccines. The CDC provides example s of vaccine labels and photos to make identification of vaccines easier (available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/guide/vaccine -storage -labels.pdf ). 4. Place vaccines and diluents in the center of the storage unit, 2 to 3 inches away from the walls, ceiling, floor, and door of the unit . Avoid storing vaccines and diluents in any part of the unit that may not provide stable temperatures or sufficient air flow, such as directly under cooling vents , in drawers, or in shelves on the d oor. 5. Arrange vaccines and diluents in rows, allowing space between rows to promote air circulation. This helps each vaccine and diluent to maintain a consistent temperature . Do not pack a storage unit too tightly. Restricted air flow can impact vacci ne temperature. 6. Place vaccines and diluents with the earliest expiration dates in the front of the storage unit . Check expiration dates of vaccines weekly . 7. Prevent refrigerator and freezer temperature fluctuations: Plug the storage unit into an em ergency outlet with back -up power supply. Post warning signs on all vaccine storage units, for example, \" Do NOT adjust temperature controls! \" Label all vaccine storage plugs: \" Do NOT unplug unit! \" Sample warning signs are available on pages 71 -77 of the CDC's Vaccine Storage at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage -handling -toolkit.pdf . 8. Maintain and document maintenance and repair of vaccine refrigerator s and freezer s, as indicated in the SOPs for storage and handling . (A form for documenting vaccine storage unit maintenance i s included in Attac hment 2 . Worksheets for Vaccine Storage and Handling .) 9. Enroll the vaccine storage unit(s) in the institution 's HVAC routine maintenance schedule. D. Monitoring Vaccine Storage Temperature The CDC recommends \u2014for every vaccine storage unit \u2014 the use of a specific type of temperature monitoring device ( TMD ) known as a digital data logger (DDL ) for continuous temperature monitoring and recording. The DDL should be set to measure and record temperatures no less frequently than every 30 minutes and should ha ve a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing (also known as a Report of Calibration). Calibration testing should be completed every 1-2 years according to manufacturer's suggested timeline. 1. The CDC recommends that DDLs have the following characteristics (list continues on next page ): Detachable probe in a thermal buffered material (e.g., glycol, glass beads, sand, Teflon\u00ae) Alarm for out -of-range temperatures Low-battery indicator Immunization Federal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Guidance September 2018 CHAPTER 5. STORAGE AND HANDLING OF VACCINES , Page 4 Current, minimum, and maximum temperature indicator Recommen ded uncertainty of +/ -0.5\u00b0 C (+/ -1\u00b0 F) User ability to program the logging interval (or reading rate) 2. The CDC recommends that a DDL's current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing include: Model/device name or number Serial number Date of calibration (report or issue date) Confirmation that the instrument passed testing (or instrument is within tolerance) Recommended uncertainty of +/ -0.5\u00b0 C (+/ -1\u00b0 F) or less 3. Spec ifically, CDC recommends against the use of the following types of TMDs: Alcohol or mercury thermometers, even if placed in a fluid -filled biosafe liquid vial Bi-metal stem TMDs Food TMDs Chart recorders Infrared TMDs TMDs that do not have a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing 4. Manually r ecord refrigerator an d freezer temperatures at least twice each workday even if using a digital monitoring device. See the Vaccine Refrigerator Temperature Log , available in Attachment 4 . E. Responding to Temperature Excursions See the poster, Handling a Temperature Excursion in Your Vaccine Storage Unit , available in Attachment 3 . It is recommended that the poster be laminated and posted next to your vaccine storage unit. An out-of-range temperature i s considered a TEMPERATURE EXCURSIO N and should prompt immediate action through a RESPONSE PLAN . The response plan should indicate specific steps to follow in the case of a temperature excursion, for example: 1. Immediately notify t he vaccine coordinator(s) or report the problem to the supervisor and the pharmacist. 2.

STORAGE AND HANDLING OF VACCINES , Page 6 F. Preparing for Portable and Emergency Vaccine Storage The SOPs for vaccine storage and handling should include emergenc y planning for equipment failures and power outages, as well as for portable storage needs in the case of mass vaccination procedures outside of the clinic. Portable medical grade vaccine refrigerator/freezer units with temperature monitoring devices are available for emergency transport of vaccines or for mass vaccine clinics. In the event of a vaccine emergency, consult the CDC's printable handout, \" Packing Vaccines for Transport During Emergencies ,\" available at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/downloads/emergency -transport.pdf . Key points from the CDC handout are outlined below: 1. KEY POINTS F OR MASS VACCINE CLINICS : If vaccines cannot be stored in an on -site storage unit, they should be kept in the portable vaccine refrigerator during an off -site clinic . Place a TMD (preferably with a probe in a thermal buffer) as close as possible to the vaccines, and check and record temperatures at least hourly. Keep the container closed as much as possible. Remove only 1 multi -dose vial or 10 doses at a time for preparation and administration by each person administering vaccines. Transport diluents with their corresponding vaccines to ensure there is sufficient diluent for reconstituting each vaccine. Follow the manufacturer's guidance for specific temperature requirements. 2. KEY POINTS DURING EMERGENCIES : Hard -sided coolers or Styrofoam vaccine shipping containers can be used for transport of refrigerated vaccines . Do NOT use soft -sided coolers . Pack vaccine as follows : Utilize c onditioned frozen water bottles to prevent vaccine from freezing . To condition frozen water bottles, place them in lukewarm water until the water starts to melt (a layer of water forms near surface of bottle and ice spins inside bottle ). Do not use frozen gel packs or coolant packs from vaccine shipments to pack refrigerated vaccines. Even if they appear to be sweating, they can damage and freeze refrigerated vaccines. Phase change materials (PCMs) at 4\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C, available commercially, can help maintain proper temperatures. Use a t least 1 inch of insulating material such as bubble wrap, packing foam , or Styrofoam for a layer above and below vaccine Temperature monitori ng device : Digital data logger (DDL) with buffered probe .
