Aims and objectives The overall objective of the work report ed here was to review and pr esent research evidenc e that could inform the practice guideli nes, to identify gaps in knowledge, and to evaluate the strength of the existing evidenc e, both in gener al and specifically in relation to marginalised familie s and those from black and minority ethnic communities . Two separ ate questions were addressed by the review reported here and reviewed separately: Question 1: How accessible and acceptabl e are services or interventions that support children, families, parenting or c ouple relations hips whe n a parent has a mental health problem, in both the UK and elsewhere? Question 2: What outcomes do these types of services or interventions have for parents, children, families, par enting or couple relations hips? Methods The methods of the review were determined by a protocol agreed between SCIE and the Univers ity of York team after the co mmission to carry out the work had been granted. Searching The review drew on an existing 'systematic map' of identified literature on parental mental health problems, cr eated by SCIE before the review reported here was commissioned. Further searches for relev ant literature were carried out by the University of York team. These included re running searches carri ed out to identify material for the systematic map, to bring it up to date, a nd completely new searches to identity epidemiologi cal literature. ix Screening and sel ection Pre-defined inclus ion and exc lusion criteria were used to screen material for overall relevance and then, after full reading of the tex t, for selection for inclusion in the review. Members of the team worked in pairs and to agreement to screen and select material. Data extraction Data were extracted from full publications into Excel spreadsheets. For question one, there were eight worksheets and 58 column s headings in the database. For question two, there were 15 worksheet s and 86 column headings. Data were extracted by one member of the team and then checked by other members. Quality appraisal The review covered material with a wide vari ety of research designs and methods, and the studies included to address the two questions were of very different types. We used no formal assessment of quality for question one, which was domin ated by qualitative material. For question two, we used t he EPOC (2002) and Jadad ( 1998) criteria for assessment of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and the Downs and Black (1998) criteria for assessment of non-RCT studies. Synthesi s A narrative synthesis approach was used for both questions. Findings Five thous and, seven hundred and five publicat ions we re identified (728 from the systematic map, 4,977 from the u pdating and new searches) and screened for relevance. Of these, 4,857 were screened out. Eight hundred and forty-eight publications were thus read in full. Of t hese, 61 studies, report ed in 68 publications, were selected for review for question one and 37 studies, reported in 40 publicat ions, for question two. Quality of included studies The quality of reporting for the studies included for question one was generally poor, especially in relation to sampling, the nat ure and representativenes s of the sample, and data analys is. Samples were also small. For question two, the quality of reporti ng for the RCTs was usually poorer, and even poorer for the non-RCT studies. x Results Question one The first task for this question was to define what was meant by access and acceptabilit y. Existing t heoret ical writing about access is largely about access to discrete health services. As a result, it wa s not suitable for explor ing the ways PMHPs and their families migh t access support servic es. A framework was therefore develop ed to help understand the issue of access, in par ticular to identify the points at which individual and organis ational/serv ice fact ors may intervene when PMHPs and their families are trying to access support. The definition of 'acceptabili ty of services' in research is also ambiguous, with no obvious consensus about its meaning. I ndeed, researchers rarely use the term 'acceptability' related to services. Howev er, there was clear evidence, although based on a small number of studies, about factors that affect w hether a parent or family member engages with or uses a service, onc e they have accessed it. This broadened the definition of acceptability of services but did allow us to dr aw a more comp lete picture of the factors that support or hinder use of services. The evidence base was weak overall, m eaning that we should be cautious about drawing fir m conclusions. The quality of r eporting, the small size of studies and the skewing of studies towards evidence about access and acceptability of health and social care services, as opposed to any s upport services that may be used by parents with mental health problems, all li mit the ability to guide practice. Howev er, the review of the evidence did iden tify a number of factors that appear to act as barriers or facilitators to PMHP s and t heir children ge tting access to and then using support services (Figure 1). A clear pattern that emerges is that stra tegies to improve access and/or to ensure parents or their children continue to use se rvices need to intervene in a number of different ways: At an organisational or strategic level. In terms of services provided and the way they are deliv ered. In the way that individu al staff work, t heir skills and the way they relate to servi ce users. In addition, the evidence suggests that serv ices need to work more holistically with families. The lack of collab oration and service coordination, and ambigu ities with regard to roles and responsibilities of different professionals mean that needs remain unmet and familie s fall through the 'service net'. xi Figure 1: Barriers or facilitators to parents w ith me ntal health problems and their families accessi ng and using services BAR RIERS AND FA CILITATOR S TO AC CESSING SE RVIC ES Individual factors Service/org anisational factors Socio-demographic fact ors Race/ethnicity factors Knowledge and belief fa ctors o Understanding and acce ptance of mental health proble m o Individual b eliefs about help-seekin g o Knowledge of service s o Fears about losing custo dy o Stigma 'Life cir cumstance' factor s o Conflicting d emands on parents o The presence of other st resses and difficult ies Mental health factors Other Staff factors o Perceived r oles and responsibilities o Professional' s view of th e case o The relation ship betwee n parent and professional o Staff skills a nd expertise o Staff tim e Service delivery factors o Ways of wor king o Availability o f worker o Availability o f service s Organisatio nal factors o Case level mechanisms and proce dures o Eligibilit y criteria o Coordination and collab oration Other BAR RIERS AND FA CILITATOR S TO USI NG SERVIC ES Mental health factors 'Use-ability' factors o Transport a nd childcare o The 'fit' with existing schedules and demands on parents' time Acceptabilit y factors o Sensitivit y to ethnicit y o Appropriateness of the setting o The therapeutic approach o Sensitivit y to parents' other needs a nd priorities o Parents ' acknowledge ment of the ne ed for suppo rt Staff factors o The parent-professional relationship o Staff skills a nd expertise Other The evidence also points to the need for servic es to take greater account of parents' priorities and desired outcome s, their perceptions about the cause of their mental distress, and to be more sensitive to the sometimes complicated, chaotic and xii straitened lives some of these families lead. Among families where the parents' mental health problem is not very severe or at cr isis, there may be more pressing needs which the family wants to or has to deal with. In these situations, dealing solely with mental health problems runs the danger of being s een as 'tinke ring at the edges'. At best, the findings from this question can alert readers to the r ange of processes and factors that may influence PMHPs' and their families' a ccess to and use of services. There will be yet unidentified or unreported factors that also affect access and use. In addition, there are factors which we know fr om other practice arenas are important in terms o f support services for PMHPs, but which are currently under-researched (for example, race and ethnicity). Question tw o The following conclus ions are based on the be tter quality studies of those revi ewed. Evidence from RCT studies 1. Impact on parental depre ssion or depressive symptoms Cognitive-based interventions may reduce depressive symptoms in mothers screened as 'at risk' for depression, compared to nothing else. However, with no placebo conditions, it is difficult to know whether it was the intervention itself or simply the attention generated by receiving the in tervention that caused the effect. By contrast, compared against a placebo and a 'no intervention' group in one trial CBT appeared to have no signific ant effect on d epression in mothers whose children had behavioural problems. Indeed, a mother and toddler club appeared as effective in addressing depression in this trial. Sim ilarly, when deliv ered alongside an existing family-focussed intervention, CBT appeared to add little to improved outcomes when depressed mothers have childr en with behav iour difficulties. One trial of co-admission of mothers and ch ildren to hospital sugge sted that delivering psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care for depr essed mothers while their children are with them in an in-patient setting may impede their progress towards recovery. 2. Impact on childre n's mental health CBT for the children of depressed parents w ho are themselves at risk for depression may improve their overall mental health and r educe the risk of depression in the future. Howev er, with no placebo condit ion it is impossi ble to know whether this apparent effect is due to the intervention itself or simply to giving the children some form of attention. A related trial of CBT for children already over the clinical threshold for depression suggested no effect over and above 'normal care'. xiii 3. Impact on children's behaviour None of the trials that m easured change in c hild behaviour showed any difference between children in intervention and control groups. Similarly, among the children of depressed parents who were themselves depr essed or 'at risk' for depression, CBT appeared to have no additional effect on child behaviour, over and above the improvement over time observed in all groups. 4. Impact on parenting There is some suggestion from a pilot RCT a nd secondary analysis of a larger trial that a 'depressive symptom intervention' and a parenting programme, respectively, can improve aspects of mothers' parenting beh aviour. However, this conclus ion is necessarily tentative. Evidence from non-RCT studies Given their limitations, there was little robust evidenc e to glean from the non-RCT studies reviewed and s ynthesised. 1. Impact on parental mental healt h problems Only one of three studi es of slightly higher quality reported impr ovement in parental mental health over time, associated with the mothers' receipt of interpersonal psychotherapy. Given the current evidence base for the effect iveness of various forms of psychotherapy for depressive symptoms this finding is har dly surprising. However, without control groups, we do not know whether change ov er time would have taken place for these parents anyway, or whether the interventio n studied was any better or worse than any other intervention or 'usual care'. 2. Adherence to the intervention Drop-out rates from interventions in three better designe d studies were high - ranging between 12.5 per cent and 32 per cent. 3. Impact on aspects of ch ildren's social functioning Two studies of relatively higher quality reported impact on some aspect of children's social functioning. One reported no signific ant change in the two measures of social functioning used for children whos e mother s had receiv ed interpersonal psyc hotherapy. xiv The other reported that children whose depr essed mothers had received psyc hotherapy were more accurate in their recogniti on and r eporting of 'negativ e affect' language compared to children whose depressed mo thers had not received psychotherapy or children whose mothers were not depressed. This further synthesis of outcomes from t he slightly higher qua lity non-RCT studies does not add anything to our earlier conclus ion that there w as little robust evidenc e from this element of this review to guide practice. xv Chapt er 1 Introduction and methods Background The Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCI E) is carryi ng out a project with the aim of publishing practice guidelines for local aut hority and health services about the planning, delivery and evaluation of services to s upport parents with mental health problems (PMHPs) and their children. This project ar ose from a Social Exc lusion Unit report 'which identified parents with MH Ps and their children as one of the four groups most likely to face barriers to getting their health and social needs addressed' (SCIE Commissioning Brief, 2006: 1). The work is in partnership with the Na tional Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the N ational Collabor ating Centre for Mental Health, and SCIE's Parental Mental Health and Child Welfare Network. With a view to including syst emati c reviews of the research evidenc e as part of this project, SCIE, with consultancy from the Ev idence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating (EPPI) Centre, completed a 'systematic map' of English language research literature on parent al mental healt h problems published between 1985 and May 2005 inclusiv e (Bates and Coren, 2006). T he searching and s election criteria for the map were designed to identify material about the extent and impact on the family of parental mental healt h problems, and the a ccessibility, acceptability and effectiveness of available and potential service interventio ns for PMHP s. The mapping exercise did not involve any appraisal of t he quality of the material i dentified, data extraction or synthesis of findings. Howev er, material id entified in the searches carried out for map development was screened for relevance by the mapping team, and was assigned key words related to, for example, the groups cove red, the nature of the service intervention, the professionals involved, the setting and so on. In autumn 2006, SCIE commissioned two system atic re search reviews from the University of York, under its 'registered pr oviders' agreement and it is the second of those reviews that is reported here. The first revie w concerns the prevalenc e, incidenc e, detection of, and screening for PMHPs. It examines what is known about the numbers of PMHPs and how parents, children an d families with suppor t needs can be i dentified. This covers not just those parents with an 'official' diagnosis but al so those parents who do not necessarily come to the attention of prim ary health services or speciali st mental health services. The secon d review concerns access to, acceptability of and the impact of services/interventions to support PMHPs, their children and familie s. It shows what is known about access to and acceptability of services and interventions available to support parents, children and families and how such support influences outcomes. 1 Both reviews have used the systematic ma p referred to above. In addition, the original searches were re-run to bring the search ing up to date, and new searches identified additional s ources of evidence. Additional exclusio n criteria added by SCIE when the reviews were commissioned were that, for the purpose of the review, mental health problems would not include ' sole diagnoses of substance mi suse, ante-natal or post- natal depression, mental health pr oblems dur ing pregnancy and up to six months after birth, or Munchausen's Syndrom e by Proxy' ( SCIE further limitation - exc lusion of lit erature on parents who are in prison - wa s added after the review had started. This technical report describes the proce sses by which the second review was carried out. The technical repor t for the fi rst review is published as Parker et al (2008). For ease of reading, and in order to keep to the SCIE Framework for systema tic reviews (Coren and Fisher, 2006) definitions and dis cussions of key terms and concepts are located in endnotes. Central to the overall project, and to the wo rk described in this report, are issues of equality and diversity and the involvement of PMHPs, their family members (i ncluding children and young people), and others who provide them with informal support. A particular concern has been the need to atte nd to the strength of evidence about marginalis ed families and those from bla ck and minority ethnic populations. SCIE's advisory group for the overall project incl udes service users and carers and this group has commented on and informed the review at crucial stages in its developm ent and progress. Research and poli cy background The research and policy background to the overall project was outlined in the commissioning brief for these reviews and we will not repeat the detail here. Research shows a strong link bet ween paren tal mental health problems and outcomes for those parents, thei r children and other me mbers of their family (see, for example, Beardslee et al, 1984; Lapalme et al, 1997; McMahon et al, 2002; Kane and Garber, 2004). However, it is al so clear that fact ors act to amelio rate or exacerbate poor outcomes. Some of these factor s are inherent to the individual, for example, the type of mental health problem, age, se x, and additional hea lth problems. Other s are socially learned - for example coping an d parenting skills - or socially co nstructed or created - for example, ethnicity, marital status, social exclusion, discrimination and dis ability. Still others are the services/interventions or f eatures of service syst ems that parents, children an d families encounter. (See Elg ar et al , 2004, for an overview of the biologica l, psychological and soc ial factors that may play a part.) The evidence base about the impact of parenta l mental health problems is relatively large. Similarly, understanding about the inte ractions between inherent and socially learned, constructed or creat ed factors and outcomes is gr owing, particularly as 2 sophisticat ed statistical methods begin to be applied to large scale data sets (for example, Eamon and Zuehl, 2001; Targosz et al, 2003; Eley et al, 2004). By contrast, there is relatively little evidence about if and how interventions and services support PMHPs, their children and familie s, or about how acces sible or acceptable PM HPs, their childr en and families find such servic es or interventions. The review desc ribed here addresses these issues. There are other syste matic reviews relevant to the general area of PMHPs but none duplicates the exact focus requi red for this SCIE review. For example, Fraser and colleagues have re cently completed a 'critical review of interventio n programmes for children of parent s with a mental illn ess' (Fraser et al, 2006). As its title suggests, this review's focu s was interventions for children, although it did also identify interventions targeted on parent s. The main limitation of this review for the SCIE project is that it did not extract data but rather relied on the conclus ions drawn by the authors of the papers re viewed. The public ation from the revi ew does not make clear the search strategies used or refer to any source where they can be viewed, does not specify the dates for which material wa s searched, and include s little synthesis of the results of the review , beyond identifying 'gaps' in the research literature. Other sys tematic reviews of interv entions, identi fied in the map, are also more restricted in their subject or methodolog ical focus than what is r equired for the SCIE project. Barlow and Coren's (2003) review of par ent training programmes and their impact on mental health was restricted to randomised c ontrolled trials and the mental health of mothers. T heir later re view of parenting pr ogrammes an d their impact on psychosocial outcomes (Coren and Barlow, 2004) focu sed on teenage parents and their children. Kendrick et al (2000) review ed the literature on a single fo rm of intervention - 'home visiting programmes' - and included a wide range of participants deemed to be at risk for poor maternal or child health outcomes; this include d but was not restricted to PMHPs. Finally, Oyserman et al (1994) did focus specific ally on resources and support for PMHPs, however their revi ew was also restricted to mo thers, and is now rather dated. The National Institute for Health and Clini cal Effectiveness has consulted on national clinical management and service guidelines on antenatal and postnatal mental health, and guidelines were publis hed in Februar y 2007. These guidelines draw on two systematic reviews - one of clinic al liter ature and one of health economics literature. Based on these, the guidelines report on psychological interventions intended to prevent or treat mental health problems in the perinatal peri od (defined as during pregnancy and the first postnatal year). However, the S CIE review specifically exc ludes perinatal mental healt h problems, alt hough the NICE document does sugges t that 'aspects of the guidance may be considered appropriate to the mental healthc are of mothers of young children over one-year-old' (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2007: 54). 3 Objectives The overall objectives of the two reviews were: To review and present research evidenc e which will inf orm practice guidelines on how health and local authority services s hould plan, deliver and evaluate their provision to support parent s with mental hea lth problems and their children. To identify gaps in knowledge and eval uate the strength of the exist ing evidenc e base, both overall and , specifically, with respect to marginal ised fa milies and black and minority ethnic families. The SCIE c ommissioning brief and subsequent discussion with the York research team identified the following specific re search ques tions for the review: 1. What is known about the accessibility and acceptability1 of services/interventions2 used in children's services, adults' services and family services in the UK and elsewhere that support children3, families, par enting or couple relationships wh en a parent4 has a mental health problem5? 2. What are the outcomes6 of such services/interventions for parents, children, families , parenting or couple relationships? Criteria for inclusion of studies in the review A two-stage process was used to identify studies for inclusion in the review. The first stage (screening for general topic relevance) relating to access, acceptability and outcomes for service users used a single set of inclusion and exc lusion criteria. For the second stage (selection for inclusion in this review), inclusion and exc lusion criteria specific to each research question were used (see Figure 1.1). The process of screening and selecting material is descr ibed in a later section (pp 13-14). 4 Figure The screeni ng and selection process SCIE systematic map: The extent and im pact o f parental m ental health problem s on fam ilies and the acceptability, accessibility and effectiveness of interventi ons. Additional searches conducte d by review team Universal inclusion and ex clusion cr iteria applied to all material Specific and unique incl usion and exclusion criteria applied to all remaining material to select items for: Question 1 (access and acc eptability in relation to interventions/services) Question 2 (service/interve ntion outco mes) SOURCE OF MATERIAL STAGE 1: SCREENI NG FOR GENERAL TOPIC RELEVANCE STAGE 2: SELECTION OF ITEMS FOR SYST EMATIC REVIEW The inclus ion and exc lusion criteria for both screening and sele ction were driven predominantly by the aims of the review and the criteria used in the generation of the systematic map . In addition, we added some criter ia for exc lusion based on research design, namely: Material based on single case studies of individuals or opinion piec es (screening stage). Material that is wholly descriptive (of, say, a model of care) where there is no evidenc e of either qualitative or quantitative structur ed enquiry being used7 (screening stage). PhD studies, unless subsequently published in some form (sel ection stage). The initial screening exercise that SCIE asked us to carry out (see page 13) identified PhDs that were of potential relev ance to the review. However, the timetable for the review did not allow us to read al l of thes e to make judgements about their quality. We thus took the pragmatic view that subsequent publication of the work from a PhD suggests that the PhD was of r easonable quality and ther efore should be included in the review when it als o met other inclusion criteria. We i dentified publications from PhDs by a combinatio n of author and forward citation searches. 5 Stage one: screeni ng for general topic r elevance Inclusion criteria Parents with mental health problems /the mental healt h of parents.

Searching The SCIE team devised search strategies for the systematic mapping before th e York team became involved (see Appendix 2 of Children and families' services systematic map report: The extent and im pact of parental mental health problems on fa milies and the acceptability, accessibility a nd effectiveness of interventions , Bates and Coren, 2006). The searches for the systematic ma p were last run in May 2005 and needed to be updated by us for the purposes of this re view. We used the same strategies on the same databases, where this was possible. Although we endeavoured to use the same search strategies as used for the SCIE map, this was not always possible when thesaurus terms had changed or, as in the case of CareData, the database had been replaced. We also carried out some focused, addition al searches , both electronic and otherwise. All these additional searches were conf ined to material published in the English language since 1985, in order to maintain consistency with the systematic map. 1. We conducted a search focusing on servic e settings outside health, social care and education where supportive services/i nterventions might be delivered. The systematic map had ident ified very few studies of these settings, a nd where they were reported they were rarely the main focus of the report but part of a wider 7 intervention programme. We did this via web searches and contact with experts in the field of social security , employment services and housing to judge whether there were other sources of evidenc e that we should consider. 2. We searched conference proceedings and international and national research registers to identify ongoing or recently completed research. Researchers were contacted for further details about the research and any yet unpublished results. Members of SCIE's Parental Mental Health and Child Welfare Network also forwarded information about on-going studies that they were awar e of to the York research team. 3. We used web searches to identify resour ces that might contain material gener ated by user-led enquiry. 4. Throughout the review process we identifi ed potentially relevant references from studies included in the review (including re view articles and systematic reviews) but, after discussion with SCIE, did not formally review any of these after May 2007 because of the additional burden of work this would hav e entailed. The number of papers so identified is reported on pp 11-12. 5. We also, towards the end of the review per iod, carried out forwar d citation searches for all studies included. For reasons ex plained in more detail below, potentially relevant material identified via these rout es was not formally reviewed but was used to gauge the coverage achieved by the search strategies. Updating of SCIE sear ches When updating previous work, it is standard practice to include any new, relevant index terms that have emerged since t he original work was completed and this is what was done here. In all other respects, the searches were run exactly as stated in the report wherever possible. However, this was not possible where databases had changed (for example, CareData has been replaced by Soci al Care Online), ceased to exist (for example SIGLE), or undergone majo r changes in interface design. In some instances, a lack of detail in the original documentation meant that the original search strategies could not be reconstructed reliably from t he published s earch reports . In these cases, we contacted the team at SCIE for clarification, which they provided wherev er possible. Where it proved impos sible to cl arify the details of the ori ginal search strategy, we used what we considered to be the most logica l interpretation of t he available data in collaboration with the SCIE team. The SCIE s earches were last run i n May 2005 and we updated them by searching back to January 2005, to avoid any pos sible gaps caused by time lags in entering reports onto electronic databases. 8 Databases sear ched PsycINFO MEDLINE EMBASE CINAHL - Index to Nurs ing & Allied Health Literature) HMIC (Health Management In formation Consortium) The Cochr ane Library Nationa l Research Re gister (NRR) ASSIA Nationa l Criminal Justice Re ference Service Abstracts ERIC (Educational Resour ces Information Center) C2 SPECT R and C2 RIPE Social Services Abstracts Social Work Abstracts Social Car e Online (Searched to replace CareData) Childata CommunityWISE. SIGLE was not searched as it is no longer ac tive and the database had ceased to be updated before the ori ginal searches were carried out in 2005. The detailed search strategies are included as Appendix 1. Additional searching Focused additional searches were carried out. All these searches were confined to material published in the Engl ish language since 1985, in order to maintain consistency with the systematic map. In addition, in order to maintain consis tency with the systemat ic map, these new strategies for the educational dat abases and t he grey l iterature databases were closely based on the SCIE searches carried out in 2005. The one, agreed, difference was the inclus ion of personality disorders as a categor y of mental health pr oblem. Although this personality disorders category wa s not included in the original searc hes or the search updates, it was consider ed important by the SCIE team that personality disorders were included in the additi onal searches. 1. Epidemiological searching Searches were conducted to identify high quality epidemiological evidence about the prevalence and incidence of adult mental heal th problems in the U K. These searches were designed to identify any adults, rather than limiting to persons specifically identified as parents, i n order to enable the team to place the relatively limited number 9 of studies that identify parent s with mental health problems in to context within the wider, adult, literature. The following databas es and websites were searched on 29 January 2007: MEDLINE (1950-2007 Januar y week 3) (OVID). week 4) (OVID). CINAHL (1806-2007 J anuar week 4) (OVID). HMIC (1979-2006 November) (OVID). Psycinfo (1985-2007 J anuar y week 4) (OVID). The detailed search strategies are included in Append ix 1. 2. Education al settings as a place w here detection of P MHPs might take place The ERIC (Educational Resources Informat ion Center) database was searched for the original map in 2005. Initial experimentati on with other databases that cover education al material suggested that a sear ch of the Australian and Brit ish Education Indexes (AUEI, BRIE) would locate potentially relevant material that is not available in ERIC. Since the original map did not contain a search st rategy for these databases, we produced our own, using the SCIE PscyInf o strategy as a template. The detailed search strategies are included in Append ix 1. 3. Service settings outside health, social care and education w here parents w ith mental health proble ms or children aff ected b y parents w ith mental health problems might be detect ed or screened, or w here s upportive interventions might be delivered The York team searched relevant web sites and contacted experts in the field of social security, employment services and housing to judge whether there were other sources of evidence that should be considered.

Reference checking/ citation searching It is commo n practice in systemati c reviews to check reference lists of included publications to identify any new material that appears relevant to th e review in question, to obtain that material, and then to screen it fo r inclusion in the same way as material identified via searches. Soon after we began identifying publications in this way, we became anxious about the amount of apparently new material th at we were identifying that was not in the SCIE map. 11 We carried out an initial exerci se, based on the reference lists of three publications that seemed central to the SCIE map (Olsen and Clarke, 2003; Oyserman et al, 1994; Canino et al, 1990) and submitted the output of this exercise to SCIE for checking against all the material that had been identif ied when they were developing the map. We identified 48 references from these thre e public ations that appear ed relev ant to the SCIE map, including st udies about the im pact of parental mental health problems (which wer e not part of the tw o reviews carried out by the York team but were a part o f the original mapping exercise). Of these, 28 ( 58 per cent of the total) were not present in the map. SCIE checked these against t he original searches and found 12 (43 per cent of those not in the m ap) had been ident ified, but later excluded. Four of these 12 were related to peri-natal or post-natal m ental health pr oblems, which were excluded from the review. The remain ing 16 (57 per cent of those not in the map) had not been found in the searches . Of these, SCIE felt that eight (29 per c ent of those not in the map) would have been exc luded, had they been found, and six (21 per cent of those not in the map) included. They were unable to track down two of the 28 references in order to judge whether they would hav e been inc luded in the map. We learned from the feedback from this exercise that, part way through the development work for the SCIE m ap, books and book chapters had been exc luded on the basis of 'study design'. We had not been aw are of this until this point (April 2007). Partway through the coding proc esses, a decis ion was taken at SCIE to exclude books and book chapters (not reports) from the ma p unless they were relevant systematic or extens ive research reviews. Many boo ks and book chapters were overviews, and overviews had already been exc luded from t he map during the screening process on the basis of study design. Other boo ks and book chapters had already been excluded during the screening process for reasons of rele vance and other criteria . Therefore, it is possible that a small number of relevant empirical research studies published only as books or book chapters would have been excl uded at the coding s tage because of this publication format. SCIE had found books difficu lt to deal with in terms of the map inclus ion criteria and also in terms of coding. Within overviews, multiple interventions could be described. The logistics of getting hold of loan copies of books and processing a large volume of information into codes wit hin short timeframes weighed against their inclus ion. In all, five of the 12 'found but la ter excluded' and two of the eight 'not found but would have been excluded' references were to books or book chapters which had been or would have been exc luded, r egardless of their relevance. It became clear from this exer cise that we needed to have access to details of all the material that SCIE had identified when developi ng the map, not just those publications that had been included in the public version of the map. This was because we had no way of telling if the apparently new refer ences we were identifying had been found by the original SCIE searches and later excl uded, or whether we were identifying references that had not been found by the ori ginal searches. After we were given access to thi s larger database, we ran a second exercis e checking for the coverage of the original searches, this time using reference lists from 32 publications from the SCIE m ap that we had identified as lit erature reviews relevant to 12 parental mental healt h problems (see Appendix 2 for a list of these public ations). From these, we identified 136 publ ications that appeared relevant to the SCIE map, 68 of which were not books, book chapters or ot herwise unpublished con ference papers. Of this 68, 42 (62 per cent) were not in the larger database at all; in other words, the original searches had not found them. Obvious ly, not all of thes e apparently relevant articles or papers would finally have been incl uded in the review, but this high yield of unidentified material does hi ghlight the difficulty of us ing a global s coping exercise (which is what the SCIE mappi ng exercis e was) to identify material for very specific review questions. These two exercis es also indicated that tr acking references from included papers would add very substantially to the timetable for the re view. After a meeti ng with SCI E in May 2007, three decisions were made to reduc e this additional burden (see Addendum), First, it was decided that our reviews should, like the original SCIE map, not include any further books or book chapter s (some had already been ident ified and included for review and these remained in). Secondly, we would not re-include any material that SCIE had already exc luded from the map, regar dless of whether we might have felt it relevant. Thirdly, it was decided that, wh ile we would continue to identify apparently relevant references from the reference lists of publications included in the reviews, we would not pursue these any further. The result s of this l ast exercis e are recorded in detail in the reference l istings at the end of the report (see pp 243-9). As a final exercise in reference checking, we carried out forward cita tion searches on all the publicat ions inc luded for review one ques tion two and review two question two, in others words the review questions most closel y related to interven tions or models of service delivery. This was carried out usi ng OVID and CSA Illumina. The OVID search covered BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid Me dline, IBSS and PsychInfo. In both cases, we searched for subsequent citation of the pub lications included in the reviews. This generated further material, publis hed both befor e and after the SCIE searches and the updating s earches. Details of the results of this exercis e for the review reported here are included at Appendix 3. This material was not reviewed. User/stakeholder involvement These reviews were conducted as part of a wider SCIE project on parental mental health problems. This project has its own adv isory structure, the membership of which included service users and carers, as well as practitioners and senior managers from a range of services. SCIE indicated that it w anted the reviews to use this structure for advising the review, rather than establish an additi onal advisory group. In addition, we used two specialist advisers for the reviews. The specialist advisor for review two was Dr Harriet Clarke. She is a re searcher in the field of PMHPs, particularly in relation to parenting, as well as having relevant personal experience. 13 Screening of studies The reader is referred to the flow chart on page 4 which depicts t he screening process. Figure 1.2 depicts the outcomes of the screening and select ion pr ocesses. Table 1.1 indicates the numbers of publications screened and selected by their sources. Screening for gener al topi c relevance The systematic map used as the basis for t he reviews was created with a broader frame of reference than the review desc ribed in this report. As a result, not all items in the map were relev ant. As recommended by SCIE, we took the 728 studies identified in the systematic map and judged their re levanc e to the review. SCIE was able to give us temporary access to the full publications that had been included in the map, and this helped this process. The inclus ion and exc lusion criteria for this stage were outlined above (see page 5). The process at this stage wa s deliberately 'ov er-inclusive' and identif ied any material based on structured enquiry that was about services/intervent ions or service use in relation to PMHPs. At this stage, no judgem ents about study type, quality or location were applied. This stage was carried out by three members of t he team, working in pairs, initially separately, and then to agreement. Decisions were made on the basis of titles and abstracts and skim reading of the public ation. Decisions were recorded on a short form and reasons for exclusion were also recor ded here. If agreement between a pair over whether or not a study shoul d be included was not possible, then the third member of the team mediated. All thr ee members worked on the first 23 records from the map and thoroughly discussed their indiv idual decis ion making processes, to ensure consistency. Subsequent comparison of decision-making wa s carried out with all three members of the team present. While the research team had temporary access to copies of articles contained in the map, books and some book chapters and reports were not available. As a result, all these, and other items where mi nimal information was available, were included into the next stage of selection. Items identified by the updated and additional searches (see above) were screened for general topic relevanc e on the basis of titles and, where available, abstracts. The same process of three members of the team, worki ng in pairs and to agreement, was used. All material identified as potentially relev ant to the reviews via the screening process was then obtained in hard copy form. 14 Figure 1.2: Filtering of publications fr om searching to selection to review SCIE syste matic map (n=728*) Abstracts an d titles screen ed for general topic relevance*** (n=728) Papers excluded (n=302) Papers Full documents sele cted for inclusio n in reviews 1 and 2 using specific inclusion an d exclusion ( n=127**) Other (n=96) Titles and for general topic relevance*** (n=4977) Papers sele cted for relevance for any of the four review questions (n =422) Papers excluded (n=4555) * The numb er of papers in the origin al map to which the Yor k team was given access. ** After electronic de-dup lication. *** All screened for relevance for all four review questions. 15 Table 1.1: Papers sel ected fo r review by where identified1 Where identified Total n identified* Total n selected for relevance Unobtainable or further duplicates Inclusion for review **** SCIE map 728 426 19 113 SCO search 944 153 112 1 Updating se arches 2,519 94 23 23 Epidemiology searches 1,288 99 0 13 Additional educational index searches 127 20 4 1 Identified as potentially r elevant from initial r eference lists** 32 32 8 4 Additional re ferences identified by York team** 26 12 0 13 References from Australian r eview paper*** 12 12 3 3 'User' orient ed website sea rches - 7 - 0 * de-duplicat ed, except for SCO search. ** up to Ma y 2007, see p . 12. *** Fraser et al (2006). **** Number includes duplicates where same paper was included for more than one r eview question. 1 No additio nal source o f material was identif ied by our housing and social security e xperts. Selecting for incl usion in the syste matic r eviews The inclus ion and exc lusion criteria for select ing items to be included in the systematic reviews were outlined earlier (see pp 5-6). Th is selection stage was carried out on all material that had passed through the scr eening for general topic relevance. The process for selecti ng items was the same as described for the screening s tage, with team members working indi vidually and then in pairs, to agreement. For this stage, however, decisions were based on a full reading of the text. The th ird member of the team mediated where it was not possible fo r a pair to agree on inc lusion and a simple majority decision was applied. At this stage, we also logged whic h review ques tions the publication could be us ed to address; severa l contained information potentially relevant to more than one review. 16 Descriptive map This stage was completed by SCIE for ma terial up to May 2005 (Bates and Coren, 2006). Interim report In addition to carrying out the revi ews, SCIE had asked for a preliminary report on developing a typology of the types of se rvices and interventions in cluded in the systematic map. This work was carried out in December 2006 and a report produced in February 2007 (Parker, Beresford and Clark e, 2007). This report was based on analys is of the abstracts of studies in cluded in the systematic ma p. Data extraction Data was extracted from full papers and publ ications int o Excel spreadsheets. Our screening of material s howed that the map included multiple pa pers from some studies. In some cases, these papers were barely distinguishable fr om one another. In other cases, the different papers reported different aspects and findings of the study. Before data extraction started, we tried to ensure that a ll papers for a given study were identified and relevant data ex tracted from them once and once only. This was not easy where differential listing of authors meant that the papers were not immediately identifiable as being from a si ngle study. We also experienc ed diffic ulty with two studies included for question two whic h had published re sults at different stages of sample formation. This resulted in results reported fo r different sample siz es in different papers. Separate data extraction sheets were developed for the two questions in this review, reflecting their completely diffe rent focus and the very differ ent n ature of the material included. For question one, papers were read in depth and a framework for data extraction agreed by the research team (s ee Appendix 4). Quant itative data, where present, were fully ext racted but also summa rised into tex t. For qu estion two, the column headings for the sheets were developed partly from the headings inc luded in the protocol but also on the basis of our init ial reading of the papers (see Appendix 4). For question one, there were eight worksheet s and 58 column headings in the databas e. For question two, there were 15 worksheet s and 86 column headings in the database, covering both quantitative and qualitative data . These are included in Appendix 4. For question one, the two members of the te am working on this question reviewed and checked cross-team consistency in apply ing the coding framework continuous ly. 17 For question two, all three members of the te am working on this question extr acted data on the first 10 papers and then met to discu ss their decisions and deal with any apparent inconsistencies. Subs equently, single members of the team extracted data, and a second member checked them. Quality appraisal of included studies This review included a wide variet y of research designs and methods. This made selection of quality appraisal tools more complex. The tools chosen were used to assess quality only and not overall relevanc e as this had been established through the screening and selection processes. We did not contact aut hors for additional information except in one case (Beardsl ee) where we were keen to understand the relationship between data published in several papers. The studies included to address the two questi ons were of very different types; for question one, they were predominantly qualit ative in nature, whereas for question two they were all quant itative in nature. For question two (the outcome of intervent ions), we used two approaches, depending on the design of the studies inc luded. First, RCTs were quality app raised using a truncated of the Jadad al, 1996; Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisati on of Care Group, 2002). These are well- established quality appraisal tools and, in the case of the EPOC checklist, developed specifically for studies about the outcomes of the ways in which care is practised or organised. Quality appraisal for other types of quantitat ive studies is less well developed than for RCTs, and we explored a number of possi ble approaches. Downs and Black (1998) have developed a single quality checklist for both randomised and non-randomised studies of health care interventions and, follo wing our prelimin ary reading of the material selected for this revie w, we felt that th is would suit our purposes for any non-RCT quantitative studies of the impact of intervent ions or services. We discussed this with one of the authors of the checklis t who agreed that its use w ould be appropriate. Howev er, not all items on the checklist were always relevant to individual studies. Quality appraisal for qualitative research is a more contested area, although s everal research groups have now publis hed guidelines to assessment. As stated in the protocol of review two, we had origina lly planned that for any qualitative studies included for question two we would use t he framework published by the Government Chief Social Researcher's Office (Spencer et al, 2003) as it had been developed specifically for evaluation research. In t he event, no qualitative material was used for question two. Quality appraisal for question one proved im possible. The includ ed material covered both quantitative and qualit ative-based studies, with a very wide range in terms of 'face' quality and the depth of r eporting of its research design, methods and, particularly, the 18 way in whic h qualitativ e data was analysed. Fu rther, many of the quantitative studies were small-scale, both in terms of sample size and scope (see Table 2.1). This made the applicat ion of any over-arching quality appr aisal tool, unless it was extremely blunt (and therefore relatively meaningless) extrem ely difficult. Also, as discussed in Chapter 3, definitional ambiguities around notions of access and acceptability introduced almost insurmountable difficulties to quality appraisal: if it is unclear how these concepts are being defined, it is impossible to judge whet her or not they have been researched adequately . To date, then, the evidence re viewed for question one has not been subject to any systematic quality appraisal system. We had intended, both for qualitative and quantit ative research, that we would add to our quality assessment framew orks the generic criteria re lated to user and carer involv ement, informed consent and conflicts of interest suggested by Coren and Fisher (2006). However, we were awar e that the not ion of user involvem ent in research is relatively new and 'older' studies might not perform well against these criteria. In the end, we did not use these criteria as so fe w of the studies that were included in the review reported any information about them. Quality assessment was not used to exclude studi es from the revi ew but to allow us to assign appropriate weight to their findings when results were synthesized. In terms of using a formal weighting system, the us e of this is contested (Petticrew and Roberts, 2006) and we did not use this approach here. A listing of the quality assessment questions used is in Appendix 5. Data management and synthesis The data extraction and analytic al proc esses for the tw o questions (access and acceptabilit y; outcomes of serv ices/interventions) were kept distinct from one another. This was because, as already out lined abov e, the publications included for the two questions, the methods used in them, and the nature of the data ex tracted from them were completely different and thus required different approaches to synthesis (see below). Further, in relation to the second question (on outcomes) we found two distinct types of evidenc e - that from random ised c ontrolled trials (RCTs) and that from other comparative studies (predominantly before and after studies). Clearly, both the nature and the strength of the evidence these different methods can generate are very different and we therefore analysed and synt hesised them separately. Quantitative data Included in the review were some studies that used psychometric scales or other quantitative tools to measure outcomes for se rvice users. However, based on an initial reading of the literature, we came to the view that t here would not be scope for any quantitative meta-analysis of the outcomes dat a due to the limitati ons of the evidenc e 19 base and the variabilit y of both research design and the services/interventions evaluated. This view did not change after we had extracted data from the included publications. We therefore used a narrative synthesis ap proach10, albeit based on quantitative data. For some studies, however, we did carry out additional analysis. This was in plac es where the reported text and tables were at variance, or where we felt that different conclusions could be drawn from the reported data from those the authors had drawn. Qualit ative dat a All the material used for question one was s ubject to qualitative analysis (ev en where quantitative data were present) fol lowed by narrative synthesis. The team was guided by the principles of working set out in t he Economic and Social Research Council report on conducting narrative synthesis (Popay et al, 2006). Where quant itative data were present, the team fully extracted them but al so summar ised them into tex t; they were then analys ed with other qualitat ive data. This approach allo wed the development of a theoretical framework that guided the subsequent synthesis. For both questions, we had hoped to be able to group the synthesised evidenc e in relation to specific population groups and/or service settings. In the event, thi s was possible in only limited circ umstances for both questions . Where possible, this is reflected in the tables and discus sion of findings. 20 21 Chapter 2 Description and quality appraisal of included studies Description of included studies Question one Access to and acceptability of services and interventions for PMHPs and their families Sixty-eight papers, related to 61 separate studies, were identif ied as being relevant to question one. Table 2.1 reports selected det ails of the studies including brief bibliographical details, the ma in aim of the research, me thods of data collection, research participants, and the country of investigation. Further details about and discussion of these aspects of t he studies is in Chapter 3. Full bibliographical details are in the reference sections at the end of this report. As Table 2.1 shows, a relatively high proporti on of studies used for this review question were UK-based. This is in some contrast to the elements of the two reviews (with the obvious exception of review one question one, where only UK studies were included). Overall, 20 of the 61 studies had been carried out in the UK, 25 in the USA, 10 in Australia, and the rest in Cana da (1), Denmark (1), Greece (1) and various countries of Europe, including England. Question two Outcomes of services and interventions for PMHPs and their families Twelve randomised controlled trials (13 papers) and 25 other comp arative studies (27 papers) were included in this section of t he review. Findings from the RCTS and the other studies were synthesised separately a nd are reported, respec tively, in chapters four and five. Identifying single studies among t he publications selected for inclusion in this part of the review was difficult, particularly in relation to two RCTS. First, there was a stream of publications by Beardslee and colleagues about a psycho- educational intervention for PMHPs and their families, developed, implemented and evaluated in the USA. Careful reading of this ma terial identified that there was, in fact, a single, formal evaluation (RCT) of this intervention, but with results published at various stages of sample formation. As a result, sample sizes varied from publication to publication. We confirmed this directly with the main aut hor of the work. Secondly, there were several publications from Cichetti and colleagues about a toddler and parent psychotherapy intervention. Again, careful reading made clear that there was a single RCT but that results had been p ublished at different stages of sample formation and, therefore, wit h different sample sizes.Table 2.1: Description of includ ed st udies that addre ss access and/or acceptability Author(s) an d date Main aim of resea rch in relation to acc ess an d use of serv ices Basic re search design and s ample Serv ice/setti ng from w hich sample recr uited and, w here reported, sampling technique Achiev ed sample size MHP of par ents repres ented in the rson, 20 03 To identify re currin g issue s and concerns among PM HPs whi ch may infor m service delivery Unstructured and semi- structured int erviews with parents Consumer and family suppo rt groups and comm unity mental health centre s Purpo sive sa mpling 13 parents (12=moth ers) 'Seriou persistent mental illness' USA Ackerson and Venkata raman, 2003 To com pare and integrate wha t is currently known by experts in the field with regard to asse ssments and services for P MHPs and their fami lies Survey of experts who have written and conducted research on the topic of p arentin g with MHP s using telepho ne int erviews Acade mic discipline s of social work, psychiatry and p sychology Snowb all sampling 8 experts Range USA Aldridg e and Becker, 20 03 To furthe r understand the nature of young caring in the context of parental m ental health, incl uding family - professi onal relation ships Semi-st ructured interviews wit h d AMHS Purpo 200 6 To explore mothers' perceptio ns of their own di stress and their chil dren' s probl ems, their treatment Qualitative interviews with mothers whos e children we re using comm unity MH services Child Comm unity Mental He alth centres Consecutive sampli ng 127 mothe rs Range USA 22 Author(s) an d date Main aim of resea rch in relation to acc ess an d use of serv ices Basic re search design and s ample Serv ice/setti ng from w hich sample recr uited and, w here reported, sampling technique Achiev ed sample size MHP of par ents the res earch Coun try experie nces, and views of the formal mental health delivery syste m Bassett, Lampe and Lloyd, 1999 To examine mothers' perceptio ns of mental health services an d areas in ne ed of improvem ent (pa rt of an evaluatio n of a particula r service) Focu s group with users (mothe rs); focu s gro up and individu al interviews non-users (mothe rs) of Purpo sive sa mpling Sample si zes for focu s grou ps not stated 4 interviews 'A mental illness' Australi a Bibou-Na kou, 2003 To identify the role s teach ers co uld play in identifying chi ldren with a parent with MHP in nee d of support Focu s group discussions with teach ers Teache rs atte nding in-servi ce nience sampli ng 120 tea chers Parent s with health probl ems in gene ral Gree ce Blanch, Ni cholson and Purcell, 1 998 To identify the need s of parent s with MHP raising youn g children, to recomme nd ways of addressin g their need s, to anticipate and overco me impedim ents to the impleme ntation of suggested so lutions Public he arings attended by p arents and by adult children who h ad ha d a PMHP Statewide review of servi ce PMHPs Conve nience sampli ng 23 MH 5 social servi ce representativ es Any MHP USA 23 Author(s) an d date Main aim of resea rch in relation to acc ess an d use of serv ices Basic re search design and s ample Serv ice/setti ng from w hich sample recr uited and, w here reported, sampling technique Achiev ed sample size MHP of par ents repres try Boyd, Diamo nd and Bourjolly, 200 6 To explore mothers and practition ers views a bout a potential sup port service Focu s groups with mothers an d with staff workin g in co mmunity MH age ncies nience sampli ng 18 mothe rs 10 MH provide rs Depressed mothers USA Cardemil, Kim, Pinedo an d Miller, 2005 To look at recruitment and rete ntion of mothers to a sup port programme, and factor affec ting recruitme nt and retention Recruitm ent, enrol ment and treatm ent retention rates .

All inpatients Denmark 46 In both cases, after discussion, the York res earch team decided to include in the review only those papers from these two trials that had been published most recently and therefore had the most complete numbers of trial participants. Two papers reporting results from an RCT of cognitive behavioural therapy for children whose parents had depression (Clarke et al, 2001, 2002) were included as separate studies. This was because they reported results from separate arms of a single trial that had separately randomised different sub-groups of children after initial screening of their own mental health status. Table 2.2 reports selected deta ils of the RCTs and Table 2.3 selected details of the non- RCT studies included for question two. Thes e cover brief bibliographical details, some details of the intervention being evaluated, t he nature of the mental health problem of the parents included in the studies, some det ails of the participants in the studies and the country where the study was carried out. Further detail about and discussion of most of these variables is included in C hapters 4 and 5 and full bibliographical details are in the reference section at the end of this report. As Tables 2.2 and 2.3 show, studies from the USA dominate the literature in this area. Eight out of 12 of the RCTs and 16 of t he 25 non-RCT studies had been carried out in the USA. Only one RCT and five non- RCT studies were UK-based. Quality of included studies As discussed earlier we carried out no form al quality assessment of the material included for question one. The results of the quality a ssessment for question two are summarised in Tables 2.4 and 2.5. Five of the 12 RCTs (Bayder et al, 2003; Cichetti et 2006; al, 2004; Clarke, 2001; 2002) scored the maxi mum of three points on the truncated Jadad criteria. Four (Butler et al, 2000; Sanders et al, 2000; Peden et al, 2005; Nickel et al, 2005) scored only one point. All 12 studies were described as randomised but Butler et al (2000), Sanders et al (2000), Peden et al (2005), Nickel et al (2005) gave insufficient information to determine how ran domisation was carried out and, therefore, whether or not the studie s were appropriately described as randomised.

The highes t scoring studies (with four points) were Clarke (2001; 2002) and Nic kel et al (2005) followed by Bayder et al (2003), B eeber et al (2004), Tr itt et al (2004), and Verdyn et al (2003) (with three points). The lowest scoring studies (with no or only one point) were Butler et al (2000), Peden et al (2005) and Sanders et al (2000). Ten of the 12 RCTs failed to desc ribe whether the randomised allocation procedures had been adequate (concealment of allocation) while si x did not make clear whether primary outcomes had been assessed 'blind' to alloc ation. Despite the view expressed in many of the studies reviewed, in both this re view and its companion - that PMHPs are a difficult group to recrui t to research and then retain - seven of the 12 RCTs managed to achieve follow-up of 80 per cent or more of the randomised samples. The two methods of assessing quality are clear about the highest quality reporting of trials - Clarke (2001; 2002) - and about the poor est - Butler et al (2000), Peden et al (2005) and Sanders et al (2000). Howev er, there is disagreement about others - Cichetti scored highly on Jadad and lowly on EPOC, while Nickel et al (2005) scored lowly on Jadad and highly on EPOC. Taking both scales into account, the overall ranking of the studies, from highest quality reporting to poorest, is: Clarke (2001; 2002), Bayder et al (2003), Beeber et al (2004), Tritt et al (2004), Verdyn et al (2003), Nickel et al (2005), Cichetti, Beardslee, Butler et al (2000), Peden et al (2005), Sanders et al (2000). It may be worth pointing out that all the trials incl uded were publis hed after the CONSORT guidelines on the reporting of RCTs had been issued (Begg et al, 1996). The Downs and Black (1998) quality assessment t ool is more complex than either the Jadad or the EPOC tools, a llowing separate assessment of the quality of reporting, external and internal validity, selection bias and statistical power. However, as in Table 2.3, we have also combined the sub-scores and produc ed an overall mean score. The denominat or for different elements varies from study to study, depending on the relevance of the quality indi cator to particular studies. Overall, the quality of the non-RCT studies was poor; only two (Bogard et al, 1999; Verdelli et al, 2004) achiev ed an overall scor e above 50 per cent and another three (Brunette et al, 2004; Free et al, 1996; Hawes and Cottrell, 1999) scored between 40 and 49 per cent. As mi ght be expected, the two publicat ions that described int ervention programmes but also referred to li mited outco me data (Emerson Davies Family Center, 2000; Arkansas CARES, 2002) scored very poor ly. However, other publications that made greater claims to being reports of resear ch projects also did poorly. None of the non-RCT studies referred to the statistical po wer of the study, despite many of them being efficacy studies (i.e. testing whether or not the intervention had an effect, using a before and after design, where the statistical pow er to detect change is a crucial issue). Similarly, very few studies addressed issues of selection bias (i.e. whether the people were selected for the study in a systemat ic and non-bias ed way). Overall, internal validity was stronger than external , but this perhaps reflects the pilot nature of several of the studies included. The qual ity of reporting varied widely across the studies; from the Hawes and Cottrell (1999) study that achiev ed a reporting score of 75 per cent to Hye Ha and Ja Oh (2006) that achieved a reporting score of 10 per cent. 64 The relativ ely poor assessed quality of both RCT and non-RCT studies is disappointing, and obviously reduces the reliance that can be placed on their findings in relation to developing practice guidelines. Ho wever, giv en the overall pauc ity of research in the area of PMHPs, it seems better to glean what one can from the research that there is (albeit with consequent 'health warnings') t han to exclude a large part of what has been found. 65 Chapter 3 Access and acceptability Introduction The process of screening items, and our preliminary reading of included items, highlighted ambiguities or inadequacies in the way in which the concepts of access and acceptabilit y have been defined by research projects. This wa s, to some extent, to be expected and was the reason why the revi ewers chose not pre-define access or acceptabilit y in the protocol. As a result this chapter begi ns with a discussion of the notions of access and acceptability within t he context of support services for parents with mental health problems. Under standing the proces s of gaini ng access to and usi ng services The terms ' access to' and 'accept ability of' se rvices are commonly used within research and practice communities. However, there is re latively little theoretical writing about the two concepts and a number of different defin itions or models ex ist (for example, Pechansky and 1981; Aday and An derson, 1981; Maxwell, 1984; Gulliford et al, 2001; Rosen et al, 2001). As stated in the protocol the research team chose not to align themselves to a particular model or concepts of access and a cceptability at the outset of the review though t hey noted the potential usefulne ss of the scoping review on access to health care conducted by Gulliford et al (2001) and the further work l eadin g from that review carried out by Rosen et al (2001). Existing models of service access referred to above are typically based on evidence about access to health services and, we would suggest , appear to approach the issue of access predominant ly from a position of non-service use to use of a single service, as opposed to referral of an existing service user to a new or additional service. They also seem to be more appropriate to situations w here there is a relatively short or fi xed-term use of a service (for example, one-off a ccess NHS direct, a series of appointments leading to the 'cure' of a condition). In addition, the under lying assumption appears to be that the indiv idual is accessing a servic e for themsel ves, as opposed to accessing services for another family member. Finally , insufficient attention appears to made to the fact that professionals may be playing a si gnific ant role in accessing or gate-keeping access to s ervices. Our preliminary reading of the literatur e on parents with ment al health problems experiences of using of services painted a very different picture. For instance: A number of decisions or processes (for example, identification or acknowledgement of need) precede parents actually trying to gain access to a service. Apart from clinical interventions, suppor t services for parents with mental healt h problems and their families are u nlikely to be provided by health services. A number of agencies or services may be working with a family, and these different agencies/services may or may not be involv ed with a family for the same reason(s). 67 Families move in and out of using services. Services may well be involved with a family over a long period of time. Children's access to some services typically happens through their parents' involv emen t in services. This lack of 'fit' between the approaches or assumptions of existing models of access and acceptability and the 'service lives ' of parents and their families led the research team to develop its own model of accessing and using services by which the evidenc e identified by this review c ould be understood, s ee Figure 3.1. There are four key features to this model. Fi rst, it emphasises the way that accessing services is a process. Second, that pr ocess can begin well before indiv iduals are actually 'interfacing' with services. Third, there are a number of stages during that process in which indiv idual and or ganisational/ service factors may intervene to support or hinder an indiv idual getting to use a serv ice. The same factor may intervene at different stages, likewise other factors may only come into pl ay at a particular stage in the process. Fourth, the model extends into the actual use of a service and acknowled ges the role that individual and organisationa l/services factors will play in terms of the level and duration of engagement with a service. The model starts at the point when an indiv idual, other fa mily member or professional becomes perceives the need for support. This l eads to identifying wh ether or not there is a service which, potentially, could meet that need. There is then a decision-making process around whet her or not to access the service. If the decision is taken to access the service, then the individual (or family member or professional) attempts to gain access. If these attempts are successful, t he individual t hen uses the service, or, using the research term, there is 'take up' of the service. Use of that service can be understood in terms of level (or degree) of engagement . For example, regular ity of attendance, degree of participat ion in a support group discussion, extent to which individual carries out 'homework' betw een sessions. In addition, use can also be understood in terms of duration of engagement (or attrition): did the individual stop using the service at a time mutually agreed wit h their worker or cli nician, or did they leave the service prematurely? Finally, t here is the outcome of using the service (evidence with respect to this aspect of the proc ess is covered by a different question in this review). 68 Figure 3.1: The process of accessing and using a service IDENTIFICATION OF A SERVI CE DECISI ON-MAKING A ROUND WHETHER OR NOT TO TRY TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE SERVI CE AWARE NESS OF THE SE RVICE individual professional famil y mem ber AWARE NESS OF TH E NEED F OR SUPP ORT individual professional famil y mem ber SERVI CE DOES NOT EXI ST NOT AW ARE OF/N OT ACCE PTIN G OF NEE D NOT AW ARE OF SERVICE DECID E NOT TO TRY TO GAIN ACCE SS INDIVIDUAL FACTORS ORGANISATIONAL/ SERVICE FACTORS ATTEMPTS TO GAI N ACCE SS T O SER VICE by individu al by professi onal by famil y member INDIVIDUAL USES S ERVICE DUR ATION OF ENGAGEME NT Premature ending Ending mutually agreed with workerLEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT DURI NG U SE OF S ERVICE ATTEMPTS TO ACCE SS N OT SUCCESSF UL OUTCOMES 69 Working beyond the not ion of acceptability The notion of acceptability appears to be even more loosely defined in the literature and was not a term commonly encountered in the research reviewed. Howev er, what was clear from reading the evidenc e was that a number of factor s are at play which affect parents'/families ' experiences of using se rvices and wh ether or not parents/families engage with and continue to use a service. Many of these factors appeared to fall outside what is typically under stood as 'acceptability'. As a result, alongside evidenc e regarding acce ss, this report presents a synthesis of evidenc e regarding a ny factors which h inder or facilitate parents' (and other family members') use of services . It should be not ed that, in se lecting papers for inclusion, the research team made the distinction between papers which simply reported what parents said they liked or disliked about usin g a service (of which there are a si zeable number) and research which explored the impact of these likes or dislikes on level of engagement with a service and/or with duration of use. Only the latter were included in the review. The title of this chapter refl ects the change in focu s of this review. The evidence rev iewed Sixty-eight papers (reporting 63 studies) wer e ident ified as being relevant to this review. Fifty-seven papers included evidence concerned with ac cess to services and 32 papers included ev idence concerned with using services (24 papers contained evidence relevant to access and to using services). Table 2.1 provides an ov erview of the papers included in this part of the review (i.e. author, date, main aim of research, basic research design and s ample, service/setting from which sample recruited, achieved sample siz e, mental health problems of parents represented in research, country in which the research was conducted). The services represented by the research are predominantly mental health services, typically inpatient or community or outreach services. This clearly does not represent all the services which parents with mental healt h difficulties use and this is an important limitation of this review. It is very likely that parents with mental health problems have been inc luded in research with regard to thei r use of other support services but they have not been identified as such. The participants or identity of those under research is predominantly mothers. No papers were identified which were concerned with members of the extended family or were specifically conc erned wit h fathers. Only a handful of studies included, or had as their sole focus, children's views and experiences. The methodologies us ed by included studies include pr actitioner or expert academic surveys, focus groups and indiv idual interv iews; case note reviews; surveys, focus groups and individual interviews with parents and other family members. The data was predominantly qualitat ive. Finally, com pared to the evidence on outcomes of 70 interventions, a greater proportion of research projects included for this review were located in the UK. The anal ytical appr oach The evidence base for this report is almost ent irely qualitative evidence or simple, small scale quant itative data. As a result, the anal ytical approach taken was one of narrative synthesis. The research team was guided by the principles of working set out i n the ESRC report on conducting narrative synthesis (Popay et al, 2006). Papers were read in depth and a framew ork for data extrac tion agreed by the research team (see Appendix 1). Qualitativ e data was entered into the data extraction c harts in summary form. Quan titative data was, where available, fully extracted but also summari sed into text and, in the majority of cases, synthesis ed with any existing qualitative dat a. Cross- team consistency in the applic ation of t he coding framework was reviewed and checked on an on-going bas is. Quality appraisal The papers included in this review repres ent a consider able range in terms of the quality and depth of reporting of research de sign, methods and, particularly, the way any qualitative data was analysed. In addition, m any of the studies are small scale, both in terms of sample siz e and scope, see Tabl e 2.1. This makes t he application of any quality appraisal tool, unless it is extremely bl unt (and therefore relatively meaningless) extremely difficult. The definitional ambigu ities with regard to notions of access and acceptabilit y also introduce difficulties to any appraisal process. Thus, to date, the evidenc e has not been through any systema tic quality appraisal pr ocess. The struct ure of the report The structure of the report is as follo ws: Factors associated with access to servic es by parents with mental health problems and/or their families. Factors associated with parents with mental health pr oblems' engagement and use of services. To improve the readability of the document detailed information about the methodology, sample siz e and origin of specific studies is only included in the text where the authors have judged it to be necessary to the underst anding or interpretation of the research findings. T hus, detailed descriptions of studies in the body of the report is restricted to where quantitative data is reported or where the topic under discus sion may be 'country specific' due to policy or service organisation factors. Tables are provided summarising the research included in the review for use by the reader. 71 Barriers and facilitators to accessing services Introduction In this chapter we report the barriers and fa cilitators to accessing services whic h have been identified by research . It is therefore an incomplete listing of the barriers that may be encountered by families (or their work ers) during the process of accessing services. Data was ext racted from 65 papers. In many cases it is very di fficult to tease apart parents' a ccess to services and children's access. Sometimes thi s is because the se rvice under inv estigat ion may be providing support to parents and children (f or example, parenting support) . In other instances the distinction is not made clear in the wa y the research is reported or because the research was concerned with all support servic es for families rathe r than a particular service. However, where possible we dist inguish evidenc e with regard to parents' (typically mothers') access from evidenc e concerning children's access to services. No evidenc e was identified with respect to servi ces for other family members, nor was any found whic h was concerned spec ifically with fathers. The factors identified c an be categorised as individual fa ctors (i.e. l ocated in the individual) and organisational or service factors. Eleven individual factors hav e been identified from the ev idenc e reviewed which have been found to act as barriers to accessing services by parents with mental health problems and/or their children. We have collapsed these into five overarching sets of factors: Socio-dem ographic factors Race/ethnicity factors Knowledge and beliefs factors > Understanding and acceptance of mental health problem > Individual beliefs about help-seeking > Knowledge of services > Fears about losing custody > Stigma 'Life circumstance' factors > Conflicting demands on parents > The presence of other stresses or difficulties Mental health factors Other facto rs Twelve set s of service/organisational fa ctors have been identifi ed as impacting on families' ac cess to services. We have collap sed these into four over-arching sets if factors: Staff factor s > Perceived roles and responsibilities > Professional's view of a case 72 > The relationship between parents and professionals > Staff skills and expertise > Staff time Service delivery factors > Ways of w orking > Availability of worker > Availability of services Organisational factors > Case level mechanism s and procedures > Eligibility criteria > Coordination and collaboration Other facto rs Individual level factors identified by research which affect access Socio-demographic factors Very little evidence was identified whic h explored the impact of socio-demographic factors on access to services. This is par tly because of the paucity of quantitative research in this area. One study reports that marita l status affects whether or not children of parents with mental health problems gain access to servic es. DeChillo et al (1987) reviewed the case notes of 127 randomly selected inpatients of a US psychiatric unit to investigate if any factors increased the likelih ood of staff ascertaining if the parent had any children. Only patients' marital status was found to be signific antly associated with the likelihood of staff finding out about the pr esence of children. Married or previously married patients had signific antly greater likel ihood of single par ents. DeCh illo et al also found that parents' gender was associated wit h whether or not the hospital social work team met the with the patient's child(ren). S pecifically, cases in which the patient was the child's mother had a statistically greater likelihood of a meeting between the child and the family's social worker than did cases where the patient was the child's father. Another study (Sleath, 2006), this time of mothers using homel ess shelters in a US city, found that mother's a ge was associated wit h access to mental health services. Older mothers w ere signific antly more likely to re port unmet needs for mental healt h services compared to younger mothers. Race/ethnicit y Just two studies spec ifically repor t on the association between race and access to service by parents with mental health problem s. One was a qualitative study conducted in the US and concerned the views about me ntal health services held by mothers (n=127) with mood or depressi on disorders who had sought help with their child's 73 mental health (Anderson et al , 2006). Although 40 per cent of the sample was African American, the authors report that , even when specifically ask ed about this topic, only a few minority mothers stressed th e importance of race as a barrier to accessing services. The second piece of work was conducted in the UK and studied a support project for Asian mothers with mental health problem s (Hussain an d Gerrard, 2001). The authors note that many of the users of the service had had problems for several years but were reluctant to accept help from non-Asian pr ofessionals. One of the outcomes of the project was that it appeared to facilitate acc ess to generic services (i.e. the local Mother and Baby Unit). Know ledge and beliefs factors Understan ding and acceptance of mental health problem Impact on parents' access to services: Anderson et al (2006) explored mothers' perceptions of their mental healt h problem s and how this impacted on their views and use of formal services. Over 120 women we re interviewed, all of whom had sought treatment for their children at community m ental healt h centres in four disadvantaged communities in a US city. All had screened posi tively for anxiety and/or depression. The researchers had hypothesised that these mo thers might not accept a referral for treatment (based on scores on a screening inst rument) because they did not regard their 'distress' as anxiety or depression. Ho wever, virtually all mothers agreed they were anxious and/or depressed, but their percepti ons of the causes of their distress were found to be possible barriers to seeking or accepting treatment for themselves. In essence, mothers' ascribed their distress to one of three causes: poverty, past or current experiences of abuse, or managing a troubled child. Living in poverty was described by mothers as continually having to maintain a fine balanc e between survival and crisis. Havi ng an abusive partner was not only highly stressful in itself, but mother s expressed fears that becomi ng a service user themselves might be used against them by the abusive partner. Managing a troubled child was the most commonly reported source of stress and mothers' sense of responsibility for their child's problems contributed to th eir distress. It also meant mo thers felt that it would be inappropriate to address their own needs befo re their child was well. Indeed, some mothers believed their distress was inextricab ly linke d to t heir child's distress and that, once their child's distress was resolved, they would als o recover. The common theme to these perceived causes of distress is that they are all external causes. This was seen by the researchers as driving mothers' negative responses to a possible referral to mental health services which mothers saw as focusing on making internal changes. The authors report that mothers made the distinction between depression which was a normal response to a difficult life, and that which invo lved seriously impaired functioning and would requi re mental health intervention. Thus the mothers believe d that relief from their own distress woul d come 'with a change of life circumstances, not medication or \"talk t herapy\"' (p 934). They were not confident, however, that services would make this distinction. 74 Impact on child(ren) accessing s ervices : A number of projects have identified that parents' lac k of acceptance of their illness or not understanding its potential impact on their child(ren), acts as a barrier to child ren accessing support services. A quarter of adult mental health pr ofessionals and welfare workers (n=60) participating in Maybery and Reupert's (2006) research (Australia) ident ified this as a barrier to professionals assisting c hildren's ac cess to support. Singer et al (2000) found that some parent s wanted to hide their illness from their children and did not want to talk to them about it, something which would clear ly be a potential barrier to the child accessing supp ort. This notion of silence within s ome families ab out the parents' mental health pr oblem is also reported by Shachn ow (1987). When disc ussing with 'well' parents (that is, the parent without the mental health problem) the possibilit y of interviewing their ch ild for a research project on the i mpact of hospitalisat ion of a parent, Shachnow found th is prompted the well parents to review their impressions of how their child(ren) were coping. Whilst they had initially stated their child(ren) were coping well, in subs equent interviews the well parents referred more to difficult behav iours and symptoms of distress. They also reported they had been talkin g to their child ab out the ill paren t thereby gi ving the child 'permission to break the heretofore stifling si lence' (p 74). Other research suggests that parents with mental health problems can also have difficulty acknowledging the impact of their illness on their children (Sto rmont et al, 1997) Individual beliefs about help-s eeking Another factor implicated in whether or not parents' access services are individual beliefs about help-seeking. Cowling and coll eagues (Cowling, 1996, 1999; Cowling et al, 2004) report that beliefs about help-seeking influenced whether or not parents' sought help with parenting. They report parents bel ieved they should be able to handle their child's problems on their own (59 per cent of those surveyed) and were therefore reluctant to seek help (61 per cent). Earlie r work by Cowling (1996, 1999) suggests that some parents view seeking help as indicating failure as a parent, and sensitivity to this was heightened by the need to feel independent and control in at least some areas of their lives. Cowling et al (2004) found no a ssociations between help-seeking behaviours and age, gender, education level, income level, mari tal status or family size. Hearle et al (1999) report similar fi gures from their surv ey of parents using community and inpatient mental health services with regard to acce ssing child care services (n=107). H ere almost half of respondents (49 per cent) st ated the desire to m anage alone, and 30 per cent saying they would be too embarrassed to ask for help. Sheppard (2001) draws a similar interpreta tion on why some depressed mothers do not access services. He identified a sub-gr oup of mothers who sought to present themselves to professi onals as capable an d coping par ents (labelled by Sheppard as 'stoics') and who could not, therefore, ask for help or support. Sheppard (2001) also reports that stoicism can be a cultural factor affecting access to services. He cites the example of a South Asian 'immigration overstay er' feeling that she is not entitled to any 75 financial support and who, despit e being in a desperate situation, would not accept money from her soci al worker. Knowledge of services A lack of knowledge about support services are reported by a small number of studies to affect parents' and children's access to se rvices. This includes k nowing that the help and suppor t a parent desires is available, and also knowing where to go to access such services. Research evidence on levels of knowledge of services among parents with mental health problems is extremely limited. Cowling et al (2004) report that 41 per cent of parent users of community and inpatient servic es (Australia) they surveyed (n=61) said stated they did not know where to go for help with their child's behaviour problem. Furthermore, 38 per cent did not seek help wit h this difficulty because they did not think anyone could help. Hearle et al's (1999) su rvey of pare nts with psychotic dis orders (n=124) drawn from community and inpatient settings (also in Au stralia) found a similar proportion of parents (36 per c ent) reporting not knowing wher e to go for help with child care. A number of pieces of qualitat ive research report parents' des ires for more information about the sorts of help and support available (Slattery, 2006; Stanley et al, 2003). Participant s in Basset et al's (1999) study highlighted the impor tance of providing information not only about the services them selves, but also how to access them. Howev er, it should be noted that these mo thers also reported that knowing about services did not mean they would actually access them. Fears abo ut losing custody of the children Fifteen studies reported that fear of losing custody of the children acted as a barrier to mothers accessing services, either for themselv es, for family support or for their children (Diaz-Cane ja and Johnson, 2004 ; Cowlin g, 1996, 1999 ; Aldridge a nd Becker, 2003; Heneghan et al, 2006; Stanley et Blanch et al, 1999; Handley et al, 2001). These studi es included those which had researched practitioners views about barriers to accessi ng services as well as parents' (and in particular, mothers') views. Thes e studies report a general fear or suspicion of all services, though social services/child protec tion authorities were particularly feared by mothers (D iaz-Caneja and Johns on, 2004; Cow ling, 1999; Aldridge and Bec ker, 2003; Heneghan et al, 2006; Stanley et al, 2003a; Slattery, 2006). The most extreme accounts of fears of l osing custody were found in re search involving mot hers with severe and/or enduring m ental illnes ses where phrases such as 'pervasive fear' and 'greatest fear' are used by the researchers to describe the ex tent of mothers' concerns about losing custody of their children (Diaz-Canaj ea and Johnson, 2004; Cowling, 1996). 76 Sometimes the fears expressed were not vo iced in terms of custod y but simply as 'social service al, 2002; Thomas and Kalucy , 2002). Four underlying reasons for these f ears emerge from mo thers accounts: Any involv ement with services, particularly social (or child protection) services, increases the risk of your children being taken away (Diaz-Caneja, 2004; Anderson et al, 2006; Heneghan et al, 2006; Aldri dge and Becker, 2003; Wang and Goldsmidt, 1996). Havin g a mental healt h problem or diagnosis of mental illness increases the risk that professionals will regard you as being an 'unfit mother' , or a poor parent and this recorded (Ackerson, 2003; Diaz- and Goldschmidt, 1996). Asking for help will be interpreted by pr ofessionals as no t coping (Cowling, 199 9; Anderson et al, 2006; Bassett al, Heneghan et al, 2006). Admission for inpatient care increases t he risk of losing custody (Stanley, 2003b; Montgomery et al, 2006). Some studies also noted that mothers' referr ed to a sense of powerless in their dealings with professionals which reinforced these fear s (Anderson et al, 2006; Montgomery et al , 2006; Gopfert et al, 1999). Two studies foun d that feelings of powerlessness were particularly strong among mot hers from lower income gr oups (Anderson et al, 2006; Heneghan et al, 2006). Stigma Two different perceived stigmas have been i dentified as potentially interfering with parents' accessing services for themselves or their children. First, i s the perceived stigma of being labelled (by professionals or within com munity or s ocial networks) as having a mental illnes s or mental health problem (Stanley, 2003b). The second was the stigma of being labelled by people within the community or so cial networks as a service user (as someone 'needing help') , either specifically of mental health services (Gopfert et al, 1999) or services more generally (Ackerson and Venkataraman, 2003; Handley et al, 2001; Cowling et al, 2004). What is not pa rticularly clear is the precise meaning of this notion of stigma, though Co wling et al (2004) describe it as 'fear of what others would think '. Stigma is something that is o ften referred to within th e context of mental health and it is perhaps helpful to point out t hat the main respondents in three of pieces of research were professionals or experts in this field. Ho wever, there is little evidenc e directly from users on this issue to provide a clearer picture of th e nature and processes underlying these perceived stigmas. 77 'Life circumstance' factors Conflicting demands on parents Time: Cardemil et al (2005) explored recruitm ent and enrollment rates of low income Latina mothers to a depressi on prevention programme (US). A quarter of the sample (n=34/137) approached declined furt her information about the pr oject, the vast majority of these mothers cited not having any free time to parti cipate. Parental responsibilities : Parental responsibilities are re ported in research both as a factor facilitating and h inderin g accessing to services. Thus, Diaz-Caneja and Johnson (2004) report that wanting to maintain paren tal responsibilities motivated mothers to access community mental healt h services. Other studies (Nichols on et al, 1998; Nicholson and Henry, 2003) found t hat mothers resist accessi ng services or certain treatment options (for exam ple, hospitalisation) becaus e they were in conflict with parental/caring responsibilities. The presence of other stresses or difficulties There is some evidenc e that parents do not pr ioritise ac cessing support or services with regards to their mental health because of the other difficulties facing them and/or their families. Nicholson et al (2003) descri be ho w meeting housin g and transport needs, accessing childc are and leisure activities for their children were goals for all mothers participatin g in their research on the service needs of parents with se vere mental illness . They also note that meeting these basic needs can be very challenging for some women bec ause of their lack of financial resources and the difficulties they have completing paperwork. Feldman et al's (1987) study of the family circumstances and use of formal support services among families where there is a parent with a mental illness also highlights the way that parental mental illnes s may not be the most pressing concern for families. Whilst 80 per cent of study families (n=178) reported a signific ant problem in the previous 12 months, parental mental illness was regarded as the most signific ant family problem for only 10 per c ent of the sample. Mo re frequently reported problems were problems with children (24 per c ent) and financia l problems (17 per cent). In addition, these sorts of problems were most likely to be rated as the most severe type of problem experienced, whereas parental m ental illnes s or hospitalisation had the lowest average severity rating. Mental health factors Research has identified a number of different ways in which mental health factors can impact on access to services - either for the parent or their children. Not having a diagnos is was identified by two st udies (one based on professional views, the other on the views of young carers) as impeding parents' access to appropriate mental health services (Ackerson, 2003; Aldr idge and Becker, 2003). Similarly, Olson et 78 al (2006) found that a positiv e result (and higher levels of symptoms) on a screening tool made it more likely for paediatricians to ta ke further action (for example, referral or on-going m onitoring). Severity of the mental health problem was found by Needleman et al (1999) to increase the likelihood of mothers' accepting a referral from pri mary care to adult mental health services. The level of severity (as indicated by a screening tool) also influence d professionals' actions following the ident ification of a ment al hea lth problem. One piece of research suggests that the impact of the ment al health problem on accessing services can be more subtle and affects the type of help that parents can access from a service they are al ready using. Thus Sheppard (2001) reports that social workers providing support to depressed mo thers found that mani festations of the parents' mental healt h problem (for example, anger, aggre ssion) made it difficult for them to engage parents in direct work about their mental health. However, the same parents did find it acceptable for them to provide other forms of support. Finally, practitioners participating in Darlington et al's (2005) research report that rapidly changing symptoms can make planning and delivering support difficult. On-going flexible support (as op posed to operating wit hin a cycle of providing crisis support and withdrawing until the next crisis) was identified as being the best way of supporting such families. Parental mental health factor s and children's access to services There are small amounts of disparate evidence about the way mental health factors affect children's acces s to services. Thus, M ontoliu et al (1999) fo und that the nature of the mother' s diagnos is did not correlate with whether or not childre n were mentioned in case notes and/or interventions were taken on behalf of children. On a different note, Nicholson et al (1998) reports that mothers' mistakenl y ascribe generic paren ting problems to the presence of their mental health problem and therefore do not seek generic or mainstream sources of help for their child. Adult mental health pr ofessionals parti cipating in Maybery and Reupert's (2006) research identified the parents' mental illnes s as a barri er to exploring with par ents any parenting issues or the support needs of thei r children. The ways in which the mental illness acted as a barri er to discussions about accessing parenting or child support included: the 'unwellness' of the parent, and the fact t hat parents are so focused on managing daily life and their own mental heal th needs that they are unable to focus on the potential needs of their child ren. Singer et al's (2000) sm all scale qualitative study of mothers and children with seve re mental illn ess found that the severity of symptoms could mean mothers were unable to take their child to their own mental healt h appointments. Needleman et al (1999), how ever, did not find association bet ween severity of the mental health problem and mother s' acceptance of their child's referral to mental health services. 79 Other individual level fact ors affecting access to services One paper reports that some children said they found it difficult to ta lk to professionals about their mother's illness because they we re shy or embarrassed (Singer et al, 2000). Another piece of research revealed that f ears about treatments acted as a barri er to accessing services. Cowling et al (2004) fou nd that some parents participatin g in their study avoided seeking help with their ch ildren's behaviour problems because they feared the treatment that might be given to the child. Organisati onal or service level factor s Staff factors Perceived roles and responsibilities The bound aries professiona ls impose aroun d their roles and responsib ilities has been identified by a number of pieces of research as acting a barrier to parents and/or their children ac cessing services. This could mean that either children' s needs (Blanch et al, 1998; Aldridge and Becker, 2003; Darlington 2005; Ma ybery and Ruepert , 2006; Hetheringt on, 2001), (Iddamalgoda and Nais h, 1995; Maybery and Reupert, 2006), (Sheppard, 2001; Anderson, 2006; Kearney et al, 2000; Stanley et 2003a) are overlooked. Findings from Iddamalgoda and Naish's ( 1995) interviews with mental health professionals provides a clear example th is in operation . They report that adult psychiatrists participating in their research be lieved it was important to know whether or not their patient had children, but only in te rms of informing how they worked with the patient and to ascertai n if the child was a ffecting their patient's mental state. Other research suggests that parents' experiences of child mental healt h services is similar, with clinicians typically not asking parents about their own well-being (Anderson, 2006). Darlington et al's (2005) survey of child protection and mental health practitioners (n=232) (A ustralia) found that child prot ection workers felt adult mental healt h practitioners sometimes withhold informati on about parenting capac ity in order to protect the parent but without consideration for the child's need for protection. A final example of the way perceived roles and respons ibilities can mean parents do not receive services or interventions come s from Sheppard's (2001) detailed work with depressed mothers (n=97) and thei r social workers (UK). Inte rviews with social workers revealed a reluctance in emotional work with their clients, partly because it was seen as being outside their remit and could also, potent ially, conflict with other roles the social worker had to play (for example, c hild protec tion). Instead, social workers either avoided raising the issue which meant parents' emotional needs remained unaddress ed, or referred parents on to mental health professionals. Some social work staff were, however, reluctant to be proactively involved in referrin g mother s to mental health services. Social workers participating in the research believed the shift in the social 80 work role from psychosocial practice to ca re management (driven, they believed, by the Children Act (1989)) meant that they were no longer able (or allowed to) do direct work with mothers. Professional's view of a case Sheppard's (2001) depth study of social workers from children and f amily teams presents interesting data on how professi onal judgements about a mother's mental health may hinder or facilitate access to se rvices. The research focused on 95 families (where there was a depressed mother) and their social workers. In 13/95 (14 per cent) cases the social worker regarded the depressi on as the primary problem, in 52/95 (55 per cent) cases the depression was seen as a key feature of the case, and in 28/95 (30 per cent) cases the depression was unrecognised or seen as peripheral. Soc ial workers' judgements were based on referral informati on and their own observations. Compared to mothers where the depre ssion was unrecognised, mot hers who were considered depressed were seen as more deserving, received a more sympathetic response from their social worker and there wa s greater willingness to put more effort into helping them. Libby et al's (2006) work on US adult mental health services also provides ev idence of professional judgements being m ade as to whether parents require addition al services. In addition to making a judgement about the rele vanc e of the mother's mental health to a case, Sheppard found that social workers also made judgements about the acuteness of the mothers' need for support. Parents who did not ask for support and presented themselves as coping (so called 'stoics' ) received less support for themselves and interventions by the social worker were very much directed towards the child. Sheppard's (2001) research also included interviews wit h the mothers and it is important to note that parents who were labelled as 'stoics' by social worker s actually felt in strong need for parenting s upport from services. The relationship between parents and professionals Much of the literature on fact ors affecting access concerns access from one service to another as opposed to first time entry into se rvices. As a result, there is a body of evidenc e around the ways the nature of the relationship between parents and professionals can support or impede access to other/further support services. Thus case managers participating in Hinden et al's (2005a, 2005b) studies report one of their roles to be mediating parents' contact and re lations hips with other professionals. The existence of a trusting relationship with thei r keyworker, social worker or paediatrician has also been identified as affecti ng whether or not parents felt able to reveal difficulties with parenting or their ow n mental health issues, and hence access support (D iaz- Caneja and Johnson, 2004; S heppard, 2001; Anderson et al, 2006; Heneghan et al, 2006). 81 Staff skills and expertise A number of studies report defic its in the skills and e xpertise of staff which may impede children's access to services and/or parenti ng support being provid ed to parents. Areas of skill or expertise id entified inclu ded: Skills to talk with children about their par ent's mental illness - identified by staff working in health and welfare settings (Cow ling, 1996, 1999), including staff working in adult mental health (Hetherington and Bairstow, 2001; Maybery and Reupert , 2006; Gilla m et al, 2003). Skills to work with parents who are finding it difficult to acknowledge the impact their mental health problem is having on their children - identified by staff working in health and welfare settings (Cowling, 1996, 1999) and by teachers (Bibou-Nak ou, 2003). Expertise in child dev elopment and mother-c hild attachment - identified with regard to staff working in adult social care and mental health (Grunbaum and Gammeltoft, 1993; Kearney et al, 2000; 2006). Recognising and dealing with par ental mental illness - ident ified by health visitors, school nurs es and speech and language therapi sts (Iddamalgoda and Nais h, 1995), paediatricians (Heneghan et al, 2006) and ch ild welfare workers (A nderson and Venkataraman, 2003). Expertise in adult mental health - identifi ed with respect to staff working in adult social care (Grunbaum and Gammeltoft, 1993; Maybery and Reupert, 2006) and and Bairstow, 2001; Kearney et al, 2000; Gillam et al, 2003) and paediatrician s (Horwitz et al, 2007). Skills to meet the paren ting needs of their clients - identified with respect to community mental health professionals (Ack erson and Venkataraman, 2003) and adult mental health social worker s (Kearney et al, 2000). Skills to identify which children ar e havi ng dif ficulties coping with their parent's illness - identified by social work staff working in inpatient psychiatric settings (DeChillo et al, 1987) and with respect to adult mental health professionals (Grunbaum and Gammeltoft, 1993) and teachers (Fudge and Mason, 2004). Skills to work with whole families - identif ied by social work st aff (Kearney et al, 2000). Knowledge of the types of services availa ble to children - identif ied by staff working in adult mental health settings (Boyd et al, 2006; Maybery and Reupert, 2006) and paediatricians (Heneghan et al, 2006). There is limited quan titative evidence about perceived levels of skills across the professional groups though, obv iously, diffe rent groups identify different areas of expertise which are relevant to supporti ng children of parent s with mental health problems (Maybery and Ruepert , 2006). A sma ll scale UK-based survey (n=28) by Gillam et al (2003) exp lored adult mental hea lth service st aff's levels of confidence about working with children. T hey found that 10/28 (35 per c ent) rated themselves as 'not very' or 'not at all' confident about work ing with child ren as serv ice users, whilst 60 per cent (17/28) rated themselves as 'very confident'. Just one respondent rated themselves as 'totally confident'. 82 Staff time A lack of time has been identified as a factor hindering adult mental health professionals' willingness to address the support and service needs of children (Maybery and Reupert , 2006). The same re ason has been given by child health and welfare professionals in terms of mother s' parenting and/or mental health needs (Shepard, 2001; Horwitz et al, 2007). Service deliver y factors Ways of working A number of studies have noted that adult ment al healt h services do not typically take account of the fact that many of their us ers will be parents too (Blanch et al, 1998). Questions about the welfare of the children and parenting issues are not raised by adult mental health staff and, as a consequence, parents do not access parenting s upport and children's support needs remain unmet (Blanch et al, 1998; Diaz-Caneja and Johnson, 2004). On a different note, staff working in adult m ental health participatin g in Gillam et al's (2003) research observed that the ther apeutic approac h taken within adult mental health can support or hinder children's access to services. Participants in this study believed that behavioural family therapy was only therapeutic intervention wh ich systematically assess ed and wor ked with 'whole families'. Availabilty of worker Access to a known person appears to be important if parents are going to feel able to ask for help. This factor was refe rred to by parents in terms tr ying to make contact outside of arranged appointment s or visits (Hinden et al, 2002, 2005; Aldridge and Becker, 2003). In Aldridge and Becker's (2003) research parents describe how it takes courage to telephone a service, and that they onl y want to speak to a worker they knew and trusted. Availabilit y of servic es Two different themes em erge from the literature in terms of availab ility of services. First, a few studies (mainly of mothers) r eport that parents find access to mainstream community services and community psychiatric se rvices difficult due to long waiting lists (Bassett et al, 1999; Gopfert et al, 1999; Stanley, 2003; Horwitz et al, 2007). Second, parents report difficulties accessi ng services at times when they need them (Gopfert et al, 1999). More specifically, thr ee pieces of research reported the need for 83 services to be available outside regular offi ce hours or usual patterns of contact. Thus, mothers participating in Bassett et al's (1999) research described the distress experienced on getting through to an answering service when they were seeking help from services. Similarly, Aldridge and Becker (2003) report families find it difficult when their named worker is not available when t hey telephone and a reluctance to divulge their difficulties to another worker. In the same vein, parents using outpatient services expressed the need for a syste m by whic h they could ac cess support between appointments (for example, th rough a key worker) (Slattery , 2006). Adults who had lived with a parent with a mental healt h problem as children also reported they would have liked to hav e had a named worker who they could appr oach and who pro-actively contacted them to check on their si tuation (Gilbert et al, 2002). Organisational factors Case level mechanisms and procedures Looking across the available evidence it would appear that there is no consistent practice in terms of whether or not adults adm itted for inpatient psychiatric tre atment are routinely as ked about their parent ing status and/or about the we lfare of their children. It may happen consistently in one setting, on an ad hoc basis in anot her, and never somewher e else (De Chillo et al, 1987 (US); Gross and Semprevivo, 1989 (US); Iddamalgoda and Naish, 1995 (UK) ; Stormont et al, 1997 (U K); Montolui et al, 1999 (UK); Mandersib and McCune, 2004 (UK)). Where practice was ad hoc , no factors have been identified which increase the likelihood of health professionals enquiring about the presence of children or their welfare (De Ch illo et al, 1987; Stormont et al, 1997), though Gross and Semprevivo (1989) (US) not e that treatment teams do not always have contact with the child. Where inquiries are made about childr en, again research suggests that procedures are not routinely in place to ensure that any needs identified are recorded, addressed or referred on (Storm ont et al, 1997; Mont olui et al, 1999; Gross and Sempreviv o, 1989). In terms of evidenc e with regard to communi ty services, findings from Gillam et al's (2003) (UK) small scale survey of staff wo rking in adult mental health paints a similar picture. The majority of respondents reported there were no formal mechanisms for recording parental status and that children were not routinely asses sed. Some workers reported conducting some sort of ' opportunist ic therapeutic intervention', but only a small minority indicated taking a more pl anned approac h. Aldridge and Becker 's (2003) (UK) project looked specifically at y oung carers and found very few had received a formal needs assessment. Awareness of young carers' issues, and even the involv ement of the young carer in discussi ons about the parent's care plan, did not appear to translate into the conduct of an assessment of the young carer's needs. Participant s in Blanch et al's (1998) state wide review of mental health services conducted in the US also reported that di scharge plans do not routinely attend to parenting needs whic h would hav e implicatio ns for both for parents accessing parenting support and also, possibly, children accessing support services. A similar situation is 84 reported by Iddamalgoda and Na ish's (1995) review of m ental health services for parents with mental health pr oblems within a UK NHS trus t. They found that the presence of children was not recorded on the discharge summary unless they were named as next of kin. Eligibility criteria A small number of studies repor t eligibility criteria to be a barrier to accessing services. In particular, attention is drawn to the fact that mental health services only accept referrals w hen the mental health problem is very severe or there was a crisis (Elliot, 1992; Gopfert et al, 1999; Stanley et al, 2003b; Slattery, 2006; Sheppard, 2001). Indeed, Stanley et al (2003) found that around a third of professionals taking part in their survey said they sometimes over-emphasised risk (harm to child or harm associated with severe mental health problem) in order to access resources. Families were also aware of the high thresholds operating for mental health services (Stanley et al, 2003b; Aldrid ge an d Becker, 2003). Green et al (1999) report this meant that, although families recognised the early warning signs of a cris is, they cannot access the help needed to prevent the situation escalating. F amilies a nd professionals also rep ort that mental health services are withdrawn once a cr isis has passed (Green et al, 1997, 1999; Sheppard, 2001). A similar situat ion is reported with respect to child and family social work support, with staff reporting pressure to close cases once the child is no longer perceived to be at risk even if there may be on-going parenting or family support needs associated with a parent's mental health (Sheppard, 2001; Hugman and Phillips, 1993). Coordination and collabor ation between services The lack of collaboration or poor coordination between serv ices/agencies emerges as a key theme in the literature as a barrier to children and parents accessing services (Green et al, 1997; Blanch et al, 1998; Da rlington 2003b; Ack erson and Venkataraman, 2003 (US)). Typically it concerns coordination between adult mental health services and ch ildren's services (but not education), parenting s upport services, and/or vo luntary sector servi ces. It is important to note that evidenc e with regard to the role of schools in supporting access to services was not identified. This may reflect current practice or may be an anomaly of the research so far conducted on this issue. A number of studies report factors identif ied by stakeholders wh ich are perceived as impedin g or facilitating collabor ation. Research carried out in the UK has ident ified the following barriers: A lack of information sharing protocols and s trategies which, in add ition, address the issue of patient confidentiality (Green et al, 1997; Iddamalgo da and Naish, 1995; Stanley et al, 2003a, 2003b). 85 A lack of formal mechanisms or proc edures between adult, child health and neighbourhood services to plan or implement joint strategies for assessment or intervention (Iddamalgoda and Naish, 199 5; see also Blanch et a l, 1998). Marginalis ation of voluntary sector organisations (Green et al, 1997). Service led approach (as opposed to a needs led approach) makes joint working difficult (Green et al, 1997). Adult mental health se rvices do not, in situat ions of serious mental illness, routinely involv e child welfare services at an early stage (Hetherington and Bairstow, 2001). The lack of a preventative appr oach within c hild welfare services mean less lik ely to co-work with AMHS (Hether ington and Bairstow, 2001). Limited opportunities and lack of time to develop links and have more strategi c discussions with other profe ssional groups as any contact tends to happen dur ing crises when the discussion is foc used on a specific case (Het herington and Bairstow, 2001). Research on interagency working has also been carried out in the United States and Australia. Clearly it is important to acknowledge that the policy an d organisat ional contexts are different, however it is worth not ing that the research findings are similar. Thus a lack information-sharing, joint working systems and time and resources to develop such systems have also identified as barriers by US and Australian research (Blanch et al, 1998; Darlington et al, 2004, 2005). Additional barrier s not specific to particular policy or organisatio nal structures and therefore worth reporting here include: Limited knowledge about other services/profe ssionals' legal and policy responsibilities, and a lack of moti vation to gain that knowledge (Blanch et al, 1998; Darlington et al, 2005a). Problems defined and prioritised different ly by different agencies, impeding communication and encouraging divis ion rat her than sharing of responsibility. (Blanch et al, 1998; Darlington et al, 2005a). Lack of role clarity, in particular w ho is the 'lead' (Darlington et al, 2004). Adult mental health teams refusi ng access to services/provide treatment on grounds of eligibility criteria (that is, severi ty of mental health problem). Case m anagers: Research in the United States ( Hinden et al, 2002, 2005) and Australia (Darlington et al, 2004) has found that case managers can improve families' access to services, both in terms of the level of service received and in terms of accessing additional s upport services (Darlington et al, 2004). Hinden et al's work (2002, 2005) with mot hers who had case managers ident ified the processes by which c ase managers support ed/enabled access to other services, these included: improving understanding of what a service could o ffer; facilitating access to the service; acting as a care coordinator on behalf of the parent for all the services involv ed; and resolving antagonism between providers, and between providers and parents. 86 Other factors As well as the more specialist support se rvices, accessing mainstream or universal services can be difficult and some of the issues or difficulties described here are likely to transfer across to these services too. In addi tion, research by Stanley et al (2003a) found that mothers with mental health problems may feel out of place in mainstream services such as a women's centre. Barriers and/or facilitators to using services Introduction In this secti on we repo rt the barriers and fa cilitators to parents' and children 's use of support services whic h have been identified by research . Again, as with the evidence on access, this is an incomplete listing of the barriers that may be encountered by families as they use services as it only describes ba rriers which, to date, have been identified by research. Whilst synthesizing the evidence it was not always poss ible to unpic k barriers i mpinging on parents' use of services, and those affecting children's use. Reasons for thi s include: inadequate reporting by the resear ch; the fact that children are typically dependent on others (usually their parents) to enable them to physically get to or use a service; and/or one service may be being used by the parent and child and this has not been distinguished in the research. A small number of papers (n=24) were i dentified which include d evidence on barriers and/or facilitators to using services. The ma jority of these (n=16) concerned parents' views as service users, three reported re search with professionals , and the same number drew on parents' and prof essionals' views. Audit da ta formed the basis of one paper and, finally, one paper desc ribed chil dren and young people's views on their parents using services. Eleven set s of factors have been identified a s impacting on families' use of service in terms of their level and/ or duration of engagement with services. These have been further collapsed into five over-arching sets of factors: Mental health factors Use-ability' factors > Transport and childc are > The 'fit' wit h existing schedules and demands on parents' time Acceptabilit y factors > Sensitiv ity to ethnicity > Appropriat eness of the setting > The therapeutic approach > Sensitiv ity to parents' other needs and priorities > Parents' acknowledgement of the need for support 87 Staff factor s > The parent-professional relations hip > Staff skills and expertise Other facto rs. Mental health fact ors The mental health of the parent was identified by three studies as impacting on parents' ability to use a service. All obser ved the impact of depression on engagement . Sheppard (2001) reported that a minority of mothers' participating in his study acknowled ged that their depression affect ed their abilit y to engage with the service. Similarly, professionals participating in Boyd et al's (2006) res earch noted that low levels of motivation as sociated with depressi on would be a barrier to parents' being able to attend parenting support programmes. Fi nally, Baydar et al (2003) found that depression had a slight negative effect on engagement in a preventive parenting programme. Parental mental healt h was also implicated in terms of the children 's ability to use support services. Fink elstein et al (2005) ex plored the barriers to children being able to use suppor t services and found that the mot hers' pre-occupation with her own mental health could act as a barrier to engaging wit h support services for the child. Grunbaum and Gammeltoft's (1993) study of a small gr oup of mothers with schizophrenia and their children found that mothers' paranoid delus ions could result in a professional's involv ement with a family being pe rceived by t he mother as threatening (to their or their child's wellbeing) and leading them reject ing help and withdrawing their child from services. 'Use-ability' factors Transport and child care One mother described the process of get ting to an appointment with her community psychiatric nurse as: 'trailing the kids all the way out and coming all the way back down' (Stanley, 2003a: 109). This vividly describes t he logistical issues faced by parents trying to attend appointment s without access to a car or child care. Boyd et al (2006) identified provision of transport, child care and food as important in centives to depressed mothers using and engaging with community mental health services. It should be noted that researchers do not al ways link transportation issues to the difficulties of travelling with young (or distur bed) childre n on public transport. Havin g to make a journey and distance can both be barri ers in themselves to using services (Bassett et al, 1999). The distance from parent s' homes to their mental health service has been found to be associated with whether or not parents' continue to use a service (Hanrahan et al, 2005). Blanch et al's (1998) state wide review of mental healt h provision fo und that lack of transportation (for families living outsid e of cities) was a 88 barrier to using servic es. Transportation was identified as a barrier to keeping appointments by 60 per cent of a sample of mothers (n=44) who had been referred to mental health services (Needlem an et al, 1999). Finklestein et al (2005) found that transportati on issues were reported to be the reason why fifty per cent of children did not complete a preventive intervention progr amme for children of mothers with mental health problems. Unfortunately neither of these studies unpick what they mean by transportati on issues and may, therefore, in clude the difficulty of travelling on public transport w ith children. Finally, not all res earch has found that mothers report services are hard to get to. Mowbry et al's (2000) survey of mothers (n=379) using community mental health services in an urban area found t hat most did not report problems getting to services. Slattery's (2006) survey of 44 mother s with severe and endur ing mental health problems using community mental health se rvices found that 43 per cent reported missing appointments due to childcare problem s. Furthermore, just a quarter of the sample found it easy to organise childc are to cover their appointments. In addition to possible dif ficulties wit h arranging childcare, parents also report that services would be easier to use if the timing of appointments to ok account of child care arrangements or responsibilities (Hugman and Phillip s, 1993; Bassett et al, 1999). Where parents are having to take children to appointments or the appoi ntment is for the child, geographical loc ation (especially if t he parent cannot access a car) can make it harder for families to use services (Hugm an and Phillips , 1993; Thomas and Kalucy, 2002). Slattery's (2006) research, which also in cluded focus groups with mothers, sheds a different light on the difficulties associated wit h taking children to appointment s. Mothers, especially those with pre-school children, de scribed the difficulties of having a young child present during a consultation. They felt the child's presence changed the dynamics of the session, acted as a distracti on and co uld, potentially, render the session useless. Some mothers reported getting distressed or feeling that they were being judged negatively when their child misbehaved. Mental health practitioners also ident ify a lack of cr\u00e8che facilities impeding the benefit of a ttending therapeutic sessions (Stanley et al, 2003b). Diaz-Caneja and Johns on (2004) also report that a lack of cr\u00e8che facilities was been identified by parents as making attending appointments or using day care services difficult. These sorts of experienc es may in part explain why Slattery (2006) also found that, in spite of possible transportation difficu lties, less than half of mothers (48 per cent) who participated in the survey phase (n=44) found home visits easier (33 per cent did not feel home visits were easier, 19 per cent were undecided), and that only 28 per cent said they would not lik e childcare when they attend appointments (44 per cent said they would like childc are; 28 per cent uncertain). The 'fit' with existing schedules and other demands on parents' time The changing, and sometimes, unpredictable nature of the lives of some parents with mental health problems was ident ified by parents and professionals as a barrier to using 89 services. Alder's study of mothers using an outreach mental health service found that mothers identified the service's awareness of their busy and sometimes chaotic lives (by, for example, remi nding par ents close to the time about a forthcoming appointment) was a reason for conti nued engagement with the service (Alder, 2005). Changes to parents' schedule of other co mmitments was the most common reason for attrition in Cardemil et al's (2005) study of low income Latino mothers attending a family skills cop ing programme. Cardemil et al also found scheduling dif ficulties precluded attendance at group sessions for other family me mbers. Participants in Bassett et al's (1999) research with mothers of young children identified the time of day services were provided (for example, evening courses or meetings) made attendance diffic ult. Hinden et al (2002, 2003) also report that multiple appoi ntments for the same time can impact of families' abilities to use services. T he authors also report that care managers can alleviate this difficulty. The notion of the way that conflicting demands on parents' time made scheduling appointments difficult was also observed by B eeber et al (2004) in their study of home- based inter ventions for mothers with depres sive symptoms. However, the nuance of meaning was slightly different and was less about changes to schedules and more about unpredictability. They noted the chaotic nature of some famil ies lives ca used by frequent childhood illnesses, financial crises and highly conflicted relations hips with partners. P arents' dependence on others for transport and ot her forms of support was also seen to act as a barrier to using servic es which adopted traditional appointment and clinic based therapies. The example was given of use of 'serendipitous resources' (p 575), such as opportunistically making t he use of a lift to a supermarket, taking precedenc e over attending appointments. Acceptability factors Sensitivity to ethnic ity Four studies identified for the review report on issues of ethnicity and the acceptability of services. The inabilit y of mental health se rvices to respond to cultural diversity was identified as a barrier to using mental health services in Blanch et al's review of mental health services for women (in New York State) (Blanch et al, 1998). Hussain and Gerrard's (2001) evaluation of a mental health outreach support project for A sian women notes that mothers valued the fact that the service was Asian led. Interestingly, this outreach service led to increased take-up of generic services. The need for culturally s ensitive co unselling s ervices and bilingual st aff was raised during interviews with mothers conducted as part of Stanley et al's study of the support needs of mothers with serious mental health problems (St anley et al, 2003a, 2003b). Allowing group members to share religious and s piritual nee ds was identified by mothers as a reason for continued engagement with an outreach support project (Alder, 2005). 90 The appro priateness of the a dult mental health setting The appropriateness adult mental health setti ngs for children (for example, when attending appointment s with a parent, or visi ting a parent during an inpatient ep isode) was an iss ue identified by a number of studi es. Some studies have revealed parents' concerns about their child being disturbed or upset by being expos ed to inpatient adult mental health wards (Garley et al, 1997; Thomas and Kalucy, 2002; Diaz-Caneja and Johnson, 2004). A separate issue is the way that adult mental hea lth settings do not cater for children 's nee ds by, for example, not providing toys and other facilitie s in waiting rooms (Hugman and Philips, 1993, Hand ley et al, 2001), and a lack of privacy and/or fami ly space for children visiting parents on inpatient wards (Hugman and Phillips, 1993; Hawes and Cottrell, 1999;Thom as and Kalucy, 2002). One professional participating in Iddamalgoda and Naish's (1995) study believ ed there was a direct link between th e lack of facilities for young childr en and par ents failing to keep appointments. Fudge and Mason (2004) explored children and young people's (aged 7 to 20 years) experiences of visiting their parents. Thes e children and young people also identified the need for privacy and 'family friendly' vi siting space. Other improvements suggested included friendlier staff who took time to ta lk to them, a more comfortable or homely environment, and a system by w hich they could telephone their parents. Mothers' experiences as inpatients A separate issue conc erns mothers' ex periences of being i npatients. Mothers participating in Green et al's (1997) in-depth study of their exper iences as service users reported a lack of privacy (even on mix ed sex wards), experiencing thefts, and witnessing or being subject to sexual or ph ysical assault s. Thomas and Kalucy (2002) report a common complaint was the lack of things to do on the ward. The therapeutic approach A subset of evidence identified for this review question concerned families wh o had experienced voluntary or involuntary hospita lisation of a parent. Two studies of mothers with severe mental illn ess (Green et al, 1997; Montgomery, 2006) report that parents valued serv ices whic h helped to sustain fam ily life and avoided the need for separations caused by hospitalisat ions or the children be ing taken into care. Another study reports the difficulties parents have reconciling thei r needs aga inst their children's distr ess caused by their absence from the family home (Thomas and Kalluc y, 2002). On the other hand, Garley et al's (1997) research with children of parent s with mental illness notes that overall, par ticipants perceived their parents' ho spitalization posit ively - either because it meant that they we re being cared for by a more stable member of the family and/or it was a relief to know thei r ill parent was bein g cared for. Aside from hospitalisat ion, two studies report that a parents' or child's dislike of the therapeutic approach was a reason for poor engagement (Singer et al, 2000; Cardemil 91 et al, 2005). This issue is not explored in any depth by either study. For example, Singer et al (2000) simply reports ad verbatim the reasons giv en for spasmodic attendance or failure to attend appointments, fo r example: '[my child] didn't like found it difficult' (sessi ons with child psychiatrist). Sensitivity to parents ' other nee ds and priorities Interventions or forms of support which ad dressed parents' perceived needs or desired outcomes (aside from mental hea lth issues) were viewed positively by parents and seen as the sorts of services they wanted to use. Indeed, Schwab et al's (1991) statewide ethnographic evaluation of community m ental health centres found that parents resented services which were insensitive to their concerns about their children and parenthood. Similarly, Slattery (2006) reports mothers' exasperation with mental health services in terms of meeting their parenti ng needs, which they prioritised ove r their mental health needs. The sorts of support needs identif ied by parents include: advice on housing and financial probl ems, parent skills training, alte rnative therapies, peer support, respite, peer support for children (Green et al, 1997; Adler, 2005; N ichols on and Henry, 2003; Parents' acknow ledgement of n eed for mental health support A small number of studies f ound that the extent to whic h parents accept they have a mental health problem appears to affect the level of engagement following referral to a service (Boyd et al, 2006; Singer et al, 2000). Swartz et al (2006) found that an initial 'engagement' session which focused on helpi ng parent s' identify specific treatment needs prov ed a valuable way of ensuring depressed mothers engaged with a brief psychotherapeutic intervention. Hugman and Philips (1993) resear ch with users of mental he alth services found that a focus by professionals on mental health issues was only acceptable when par ents' explic itly desired this. In addition, Schwab et al's (1991) work suggests that a mental health inter vention which addresses parent s' own perceived mental health needs supports engagement . The degree to which parents' recognise and accept of their children's needs was also been found in one study to be a factor facilit ating or hin dering the child join ing or maintaining attendance of a therapeutic group (Finkelstein et al, 2005). 92 Staff factors The parent-professional relationship Given the high degree of anxiety a bout losing custody of their children through their involv ement with servi ces, it is not surprising that, on the basis of the evidenc e available, the nature of the relati onship bet ween a par ent and professional appears to be associated with levels of engagem ent. A number of studies f ound that that trust (in the professional) is implic ated by parents as a fact or affecting the level to which a parent is prepared to engage wit h and/or maintain cont act with services (Green et al, 1997; Finklestein et al, 2005; Stanley et al, 2003a, 2003b; Wang and Goldschmidt, 1996). Howev er, aside from this notion of trust, wh ile a number of studies describe the sort of relationship parents say they would like or value with professionals, just two studies (Alder, 2005; Anderson et al, 2006) explicitly explore its potential impact on whether or not a parent (or their child) continues to use a service. Alder's (20 05) study sought the views of mothers using a voluntary sector outreach project ( but who had failed to engage with statutory services) about why they continue d to attend the project. Honesty and openness of staff (especially with respect to their child protecti on responsibilities) was identified by mothers as a reason for continued engagement. Anderson et al's (2006) study of 127 low income mothers with m ental health problems who were bringing their childr en for behavioural health care not ed parents reporting a lack of partnership with professionals were sceptical and distru sted clinic ians and the service system. This, in turn, led to alienation from serv ices and an unwillingness to return. As noted earlier, there is other research simply reporting the sort of relationship parents want with professionals and/or how they want to be treated but whic h did not research. Intuitively, these sorts of factors woul d seem to influence whether or not parents continue to use services, and will therefore be briefly summarised. Thus, features of their relationship valued by parents reported in these pieces of research include: honesty (Hinden et al, 2002, 2005); respect (Nicholson and Henry, 2003); strengths acknowledged (Nicholson and Henry, 2003; Hinden et al, 2002, 2005; Hugman Phillips, (Green et approach (Swartz et al, 2006; Hugman Montgomery et al, 2006); and proper invo lvement in meetings and decision-making (Stanley et al, 2003a, 2003b). Staff skills and expertise A small nu mber of studies ide ntified staff skills and expe rtise in working with p eople with mental health issues as a factor affecti ng whether or not parents continued to use support services, or the degree of thei r engagement with them. Sheppard (2001) found that a lack of awareness on t he part of (generic) social workers of the effects of depression on confidence and self-esteem le d to break downs in the partnership between m others and social worker s. Mothers' participat ing in Mont gomery et al's (2006) depth study of mothers with severe mental illness report a lack of understanding among health care professionals of the distress they experience because their mental health is 93 impeding their ability to parent. This was se en to affect the relationship mothers had with these professionals. Finally, Grunbaum and Gammeltoft (1993) report social work staff's lack of experience of working with parents with schizophrenia meant they did not know how to respond in situations where mothers were withdrawing themselves and their childr en from services. Other barr iers or faci litators to usi ng ser vices Other barriers or facilitators to using services were identified by a just a couple or a single study. Shachno w (1987) reports that fa miliarity with the build ing in wh ich a service loc ated and a comfortable ambienc e hel ps to increase the appeal of a service. Ensuring a parent could use a mental heal th service without the local community knowing was identifie d as facilitating use of a service by two pieces of research (Wang and Goldsc hmidt, 1996; Swartz et al, 2006). One study identified the perceived effect iveness of an intervention as a reason why parents do, or do not, continue to us e a service (Singer et al, 2000). Finally, Sheppard's (2001) study of social work involvement with depressed mothers notes persistence on the part of the professional was s omething valued by parents and, intuitively, would appear to relate to levels of engagement or attrition. Wang and Goldschmidt (1996) interviews with psychiatr ic inpatients revealed a similar theme, with participants stating that profe ssionals should keep in contact even if parents reject help. Conclusions An initial task for the reviewer s was to define the notions of access and acceptability. In terms of access, the existing conceptual literature was found to have been developed on the basis of access to certain types of health services and did not, therefore, fully accommodate the processes by which parents with a mental healt h problem and their families may be accessing suppo rt services. A model was therefore develop ed to act as framework by which the issue of access c ould be understood and, in particular, the various points within the access process at which indiv idual and or ganisational/service factors may intervene. Similarly, a closer inspection of the way in which 'acce ptability of services' is defined in the literature revealed a lack of consensus and much ambiguity. Indeed, the term acceptabilit y of services was rarely encounter ed in the literature. There was, however, a clear, but small, body of evidence which pr ovided ins ight into factors which affect whether or not a parent or family member en gages with or actually uses a service once it has been accessed. This significant ly broadened what might be understood by acceptabilit y of services but did allow a more complete picture of what is currently known about factors which support or hi nder use of services to be reviewed and presented. 94 The evidence reviewed in this report was wi de-ranging in terms of topic and quality. The great majority of the resear ch was concerned with mothers or 'parents'. No research was found relating exc lusively to fathers. In addition, whilst many studies were interested in support services for children, very few had actually dir ectly involv ed children in the research. In addition to these conceptual ambiguities and the bias in the samples represented in the research, there are further reasons wh y the current evidenc e base is weak and caution therefore needs to be exercised in dr awing any conclus ions. First, there are difficulties with the quality or robustness of the evidenc e base. Whilst no systematic process of quality appraisal has been applied to the evi dence, the quality of reporting, particularly with regard to samp ling, the nature of the samp le, the representativeness of the sample and data analysis, was not of a cons istently high standard. In addition, many of the studies had small sample sizes. Seco nd, evidenc e with respect to a particular sub-topic or issue is often confined to a handful of, sometimes diverse, research projects, some of which are of questionable quality. Finally, the focus of research was predominantly on mental health service s upport and parenting support for mothers. Evidenc e with regard to other support servic es was either restricted to one or two studies or, if published, was not identified by the searches. Thus the current evi dence base is skewed towards evidence with r egard to access and acceptability of certain support services, as opposed to any suppor t service which may be used by parents with mental health problems. With these limitations in mind, the review of the evidenc e led to the identification of a number of factors which appear to act as barri ers or facilitators to parents with mental health problems and their children accessi ng and then using support services, see Figure 3.2. 95 Figure 3.2: Factors identified by the r eview as acting as barrier s or facilitators to parents w ith mental health pr oblems and their families accessing and using services BARRIERS AND FACILI TATORS TO ACCES SING SERVICES Individual factors Servi ce/organisational factors Socio-dem ographic factors Race/ethnicity factors Knowledge and belief factors o Understanding and acceptance of mental health problem o Individual beliefs about help-seeking o Knowledge of services o Fears about losing custody o Stigma 'Life circumstance' factors o Conflicting dem ands on parents o The presence of other stresses and difficulties Mental health factors Other Staff factor s o Perceived roles and responsibilities o Professional' s view of the case o The relationship between parent and professional o Staff skills and expertise o Staff tim e Service delivery factors o Ways of w orking o Availability of worker o Availability of services Organisational factors o Case level mechanis ms and procedures o Eligibility criteria o Coordination and collaboration Other BARRIERS AND FACI LITATORS TO USING SERVI CES Mental health factors 'Use-ab ility' factors o Transport and childc are o The \"fit\" with existing schedules and dem ands on parents' time Acceptabilit y factors o Sensitiv ity to ethnicity o Appropriat eness of the setting o The therapeutic approach o Sensitiv ity to parents' other needs and priorities o Parents ' acknowledgement of the need for support Staff factor s o The parent-professional relations hip o Staff skills and expertise Other 96 One of the clear patterns emer ging from the evidenc e is that strategies to improve access and/or to ensure parents or their child ren continue to use services need to intervene in a number of different ways: At an organisational or strategic level. In terms of services provided and the way they are deliv ered. In the way that individu al staff work, t heir skills and the way they relate to servi ce users. In addition, the evidence would s uggest that services need to work more holistically with familie s. The lack of collabor ation and service coordinatio n, ambiguities with regard to roles and re sponsib ilities mean th at needs remain unmet and families fall through the 'service net'. The evidence also points to the need for servic es to take greater account of parents' priorities and desired outcomes, their perceptions as to the cause of their mental distress, and to be more sensitive to the sometimes complicated, chaotic and straitened lives some of these families lead. In particular, the findings from some research suggests that, among families wh ere the parents' mental health pr oblem is not very severe or at crisis, other more pressing needs are being experienced which the family wants to or has to deal with. In these situations, sole ly dealing with mental health problems could be seen as mere ly 'tinkering at the edges'. In conclusion, at best this review should be used as a resource which alerts readers to the possible range of proce sses and factors at play as parents with mental health problems and their families acce ss and use services . It is important to bear in mind that there will b e, as yet, unidentif ied or unreported factors whic h are impacting on families' access to and use of support services. In additi on, there are factors which, from other practice arenas, are k nown as important but which are under-researched in terms of support services for parents with mental hea lth problems (for example, race and ethnicity). 97 99 Chapter 4 Outcomes of servic es or interventions for parents with mental health problems and their families: results from the randomised controlled trials Introduction In this chapter we review the findings from the 12 randomised contro lled trials (RCTs) - reported in 13 papers - that were identified and included in this section of the review. Results from studies that used other comparat ive designs are described in Chapter 5. As we described earlier, deciding exactly ho w many trials were represented in the papers we identified was problemat ic. In terms of what follows, we believe that we are reporting results from identified single trials, regardless of t he number of times they have reported interim results. Thus the papers related to the Beardslee trial of a psycho- educational intervention (Beardslee et al , 2003) and the two papers related to the Cichetti trial of toddler and par ent psychotherapy (Cichetti et al, 2000; Toth et al, 2006) are included because they r eport the most recently pub lished findings based on the most complete numbers of trial participants. The Clarke et al (2001 and 2002) papers are reports of separate arms of a trial that re cruited and screened via a single route. However, as randomisation was carried out s eparately for each arm, after subjects had been screened, and the target groups for t he two studies were different, we have treated these as separate trials here. Description of the service or intervention Table 4.1 summarises information about the services or interventions evaluated in the RCTs, the control conditions that they we re compared against, for whom they were intended, and other details of their delivery or organisation. Further details about the nature and intensity of the interventi ons are included at Appendix 6. Intervention and control conditions Five trials evaluated some form of cognitive behavioural therapy (C BT), either alone or in combination with another intervention; three a psycho-educational intervention (in one case in conjunction with CBT); two a 'mother and child' ward in an in-patient setting; one a parent training programme; one toddler and parent psychotherapy; and one a nurse-delivered, depressive sym ptom intervention.

Four trials clearly compared one form of specialis t, supportive intervention with another - for example, two different forms of psycho-educ ation (Beardslee et al, 2003); a behavioural family intervention wit h or without CBT (Sander s et al, 2000); inpatient treatment with or without co-admission of children (Nickel et al, 2005; Tritt et al, 2004). Further, two trials added an element to a pre-existing, mainstre am intervention; a parent training programme with and without Head start (Baydar et al, 2003) and a depressive symptom intervention with or without Early Headstart (B eeber et al, 2004). Howev er, half the trials had 'no int ervention' c ontrol condit ions. Thes e were the studies of: Butler et al (2000), where a waiting lis t control design was used and the control s eventually received the intervention. Verduyn et al (2003), whic h had both placebo (a mother and toddler group) and no intervention control conditions. Toth et al (2006); Cichetti et al (2000), wh ich had a 'no intervention' control condition for depressed mothers and a comparat ive group of non-depr essed mothers. Clarke et al (2001, 2002), where the control groups received 'us ual care'12. Peden et al (2005) where the contro l condition was not specified. The nature of the control condi tions in these trials is im portant because of the real possib ility of placebo effects in this area of research. In other word s, subjects respond to an intervention, not necessarily because it is that particular intervention , but because they would respond to any kind of inpu t. In a trial of a drug, this problem is dealt with by having a placebo condition - thos e randomised to the study condition are given an ac tive drug while those randomised to the control condition are given a 'drug' that looks in every way like the active drug but is, in fact, inactive. Controlling for possible placebo effects is more difficult in trials that are comparing models of care, as in this review. Only one trial tried to deal with possible plac ebo effects (Verduyn et al, 2003); one control group attended a mother and toddler group and another received no intervention at all. In su ch trials, ensuring that the intervention and the placebo are otherwise co mparable can be challenging. In the Verduyn et al (2003) trial, for example, the mother and t oddler group ran at the same frequency as the CBT group, used the same staffing ratio, had t he same facilities av ailable, and included 'informal, non-directed group discussion of pr oblems raised by mothers' (p 344) and comparable play opportunities for the childr en. When successfully achieved, a design of this sort also opens up the possibility of sho wing that the 'new' intervention is actually no better than something that already exists - in this case, a mother and toddler group. Aims and focus of the intervention Six interventions aimed to treat or reduc e parental mental health pr oblems, three specifica lly addressed aspects of parenting b ehavio ur or sk ills, three aimed to increase parental understanding about their children and two to improve communication between parents and their children about PMHPs. Other aims included supporting other family members (1), preventi ng or treati ng depres sion in adole scents with depressed parents 104 (2), optimising mother child attachment (1) and improvin g access to social support during depr ession (1). As these figures sugg est, some i nterventions had multiple aims. All but one of the trials wa s concerned with parental depre ssion or risk of depression (the other was concerned with anxiety disorder) and eight were aimed at mothers, rather than 'parents'. Two trials (Clark e et al, 2001, 2002) were concerned with both depressed parents and their child ren who were depressed or at risk of depression, and two (Sanders et al, 2000; Verduyn et al, 2003) with depressed mothers who had children with behavioural problems. The ages of the children varied; the youngest were in the Beeber et al (2004) study (6 months to 30 months) and the ol dest in the two Clarke et al trials (12-18 years). Only one study (Sanders et al, 2000) did not spec ify the ages of the children included. In the 11 trials aimed at parents with depressi on, various definitions of depression were used, with little consistency across the st udies, even where similar measures or methods of assessment had been used. For ex ample, Butler et al (2000) included parents where a review of medical charts s howed a dia gnosis of depression and at least one 'treatment visit' to a prim ary care provider in the previous 12 months. By contrast, Verduyn et al (2003) used a screening tool (the Beck Depression Inventory, BDI, using a 'cut-off' score of 15) and then the Structured Clin ical Interview to assess mothers' depressive symptoms against an inte rnationally recognis ed diagnos tic tool. In two trials, the focus was on mothers 'at risk' of depre ssion; in one case assessed by positive responses to five 'parenting risk factors associ ated with mental health risk' (Bayder et al, 2003) and in the other (Peden et al, 2005) by screening with the BDI or the C enter for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D) and using a 'cut-off' score ( 10 and 16 respectively). In total, five of the 12 trials (including the one about generalised anxiety disorder) clearly state that they carried out formal asse ssment of mental health status based on a structured clinical interview and recognis ed diagnostic criteria (Tritt et al, 2004; Verduyn et al, 2003; Clarke et al, 2001, 2002; Nickel et al, 2005). Sanders et al (2000) reported using a 'structured intake intervie w' but it is not clear what this was or who did it. Service deliver y and organi sation One trial (B utler et al, 2000) evaluated an intervention that was self-administered - a video-based psycho-educational resource. T he ma jority of the other interventions were delivered by psychologists (menti oned in thr ee), 'therapists' (mentioned in five), and mental health nurses (mentioned in two), with some interventions involving more than one type of professional. The in-patient model of care (Tritt et al, 2004; Nickel et al, 2005) involved psychiatrists and psychotherapi sts, although the model of care being evaluated was co-admission of children to a mother and child wa rd; little detail was given about how this was actually achieved in practice. 105 106 The settings for the interventions were also varied; three involved home delivery in whole or part, four involved 'o ut-patient' or primary care settings, two an in-patient setting, and one school setting. In two trials, the setting for the intervention was not mentioned or was not clear. Location Only one trial (Verduyn et al, 2003) was in the UK. Two (of the same intervention but with different patient groups) were in Germany (Tritt et al, 2004; Nickel et al, 2005), one in Australia (Sanders et al, 2000) and the remainder in the USA. Outcomes reported Table 4.2 summarises the outcomes report ed in the 13 papers associated with the 12 trials. As this shows, the outcomes that t he studies focussed on were varied: effect on parental mental health (six trials), parents' self-reported response to the intervention (four), the psychological health or well-bei ng of children (two), children's behaviour (four), some other aspect of outcomes for children (three), parenti ng behaviour (three) and mother-child relationships (one). No tr ial reported information on the costs of the intervention. Outcomes for parents Parental mental health and well-being Table 4.3 summarises findings from the six tr ials that reported parental mental health problems or well-being as an outcome. Depressive symptoms Five of these trials were concerned with depr essive symptoms. Two trials (Sanders et al, 2000; Verduyn et al, 2003), both involving CBT with depressed mothers with children with behavioural problems, found no differ ence in levels of measured parental depression at final follow-up. One of these trials (Verduyn) had a placebo condition as well as a 'no treatment' control group. The other (Sanders) compared behavioural family intervention with or without the addition of CBT (and had equalised the amount of intervention received in both groups).

BDI Beck Depression Inve ntory Ha milton rs for Epi demiology Studie s Depression ESI Everyday Stressors In dex One trial that compared CBT with no intervent ion for low-income mothers 'at risk' of depression (Peden et al, 2005) f ound statistically significant differences in both the depression measures used, at fi nal follow-up, in favour of the intervention. Similarly, Beeber et al (2004), which com pared Headst art with or without a depressiv e symptom intervention, reported signific ant differences in favour of the intervention in depression measures at final follow-up. In both these trials the same cut-off point on the same depression measure was used. Finally, the Nickel et al (2005) trial, which had been testing the proposition that treating depressed mothers in a mother and child, in- patient ward would have no deleterious effects on mothers' re covery, fo und that mothers in the inte rvention actually did worse, in terms of depression scores, at both f our and six weeks into their treatment. Anxiet y The sixth trial (Tritt et al, 2004) dealt with mothers with generalised anxiety disorders and explor ed whether or not joint admission of children with their mothers into an in- patient setting had any negative effect on the mothers' treatment. A s the data reported in the table suggest, there was no evidence of this after six weeks of in-patient care. This is in c ontrast to the similar trial expl oring the effects of co-admission of children on mothers with depression. Cognitive sy mptoms Two trials looked at the impact of interv ention on cognitive sympt oms, and whether or not these improved with CBT (Sanders et al, 2000; Peden et al, 2005). Results from the two studies were different. The Sanders et al (2000) trial found no signific ant difference in change between the groups' negative thoughts from basel ine to follow-up while Peden et al (2005) reported a la rge group effect (and a l arge ti me effect - that is, both groups improved over time). The Peden et al (2005) trial had no placebo or alternative treatment control condition, so is comparing CBT with nothing, whereas the Sanders et al (2000) tri al measured the effect of CBT in addition to a behavioural family intervention. However, the Sanders trial wa s also targeted at mothers whose children had behav ioural problems. Stress The Peden et al (2005) trial also looked at the impact of CBT on parents' reported stress. Again, the study gr oup was reported to have improv ed signif icantly more than the control group, although both improved simply with time. 115 116 Self-reported response to the intervention Four trials (Beardslee et al, 2003; Butler et al, 2000; Tritt et al, 2004; Nickel et al, 2005) reported some type of measure that assessed parents' own r eactions to the intervention being tested (see Table 4.4). These predomi nantly assessed self-perceived change in parents' behaviour or attitudes towards or concerns about their children. Two of the trials were of forms of p sycho-educational input and two of a mother and child ward in an in-patient setting. In no ca se was there any significant difference between those in the intervention group and those in control gr oups at final follow-up, whenever that was. Butler et al (2000) also reported general assessments of the programmes' usefulness from 'family members'. This revealed that 88 per cent of 'family members' reported benefiting from the video-based psycho-educational intervention at least 'a little'. When asked about the separate el ements of the programme, 84 per cent were at least 'somewhat satisfied' with the parent video, 89 per cent with the ch ild video and 86 per cent with the programme manual. Beeber et al (2004) reported qualitative material about how useful mothers found a nurse-led depressive symptom intervention. Their findings suggest that mothers found the intervention most useful to them w hen the nurse guided them towards practical solutions to their problems and helped t hem to make connections between their depressive symptoms and their problems. Other outcomes for parents Perceived social support The Sanders et al (2000) tria l of behavioural family interv ention, plus or minus CBT, reported parents' levels of social support as an outcome, using the Social Support Inventory. This showed that both groups' social support levels changed significantly over time but that the degree of change was equi valent for both groups (main effect for time F[2,30] = 4.66, p=.017; gr oup main effect F=2.17, ns). Access to services Overall family access to in-patient and out-patient health services was used as an outcome in the Butler et al (2000) trial of a video-based psycho-educational intervention. Comparison of the number of out-patient visits at six wee ks showed a main effect for time (F[1,67] = 4.05, p=.048) but no group or interaction effects (F values not reported). Data on in-patient episodes we re too sparse for analysis.

The first trial (Clarke et al, 2001), which intervened with children deemed 'at risk' of depression, reported signific antly better out comes for children who had received CBT, for the presence and severity of depressi on (CES-D score and HAM-D) but not for the depression sub-scale of the CBCL. This tr ial also reported the incidence and risk of 'new affective episodes' up to 24 months af ter the intervention ended. Statistically signific ant differences were found between study and control group adolescents at 12 and 18 months follow-up, but by 24 months the differences between the two groups had reduced and were no longer statistically significant. Of those who did develop a depressive condition, children in the study group were likely to do so significantly later (at an average of 14 months after the intervent ion) than those in the control group (6.3 months). By contrast, in the other trial (Clarke et al, 2002) which was for children who had been defined as depressed at the st art of the study, there were no significant differences between study and control groups on these three measures. Given that there was no placebo or alternative treatment c ontrol in these trials, the possib ility of a Hawthorne effect on the 'at risk' children , who started the trial with 'sub- syndromal' depressive symptoms, seems real. This is especially so given the gradual reduction in apparent effect over time. By contrast, the CBT interv ention seemed to have no impact on those who were already experiencing clinical lev els of depressive symptoms. In other words, doing something with the childr en of depressed parents who are themselves at risk for depression may improve their overa ll mental health and reduce the risk of depression in the future. However, with no placebo condition it is impossible to know whether this apparent effect is due to the intervention itself or simply to giving the children s ome form of attenti on. By contrast, when children are already over the clinical threshold for depressi on, CBT appears to have no effect over and above 'nor mal care', which, as explained ear lier, could include other forms of mental health input. Child behavi our Several of the trials used the Child Behavio r Checklist (CBCL) to assess outcomes for children. T his checklis t measures child ren's competencies and behaviour prob lems, based on the report of those who care for the ch ildren. It is based on nine 'constructs' or syndromes - social withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxiety/depression, social problems, thought problems, a ttention problems, sexual problems, delinquent behaviour and aggres sive behav iour. The results are oft en reported as an Internaliz ing Problems score (based on a combination of the soci al withdrawal, somatic complaints and anxiety/depression scales) and an Externalisi ng Problem s score (a combination of the 121 122 delinquent behaviour and aggressi ve behaviour scales). A Total Problem Score can also be reported, based on a selection of questi ons in the checklist. Further, as in the Clarke et al (2001, 2002) trials reported abov e, the depression element of the checklist is also used separately. The Youth Self Report (YSR) is an equivalent measure, based on the same constructs, but young people themselves complete the measure. Five trials (Beardslee et al, 2003; Sanders et al, 2000; Verduyn et al, 2003; Clarke et al, 2001, 2002) reported outcomes for children using the CBCL or the YSR Internalising, Externalising or Total Problem Scores. None of these demonstrate d any significantly different outcomes for study groups compared to control groups, regardless of whether or not a placebo or alternative intervention c ontrol condition was in place (Table 4.6). Sanders et al (2000) and Verduyn et al (2003) , both of which were targeted at mothers with depression whose children had behaviour pr oblems, also report ed other measures of child behaviour as outcomes. In the Sander s et al (2000) trial there was no evidence of significantly different change in parents' reports of their children's behaviour between baseline and final follow-up for the children in the study groups compared to the control groups. When each group was tested separately in the Verduyn et al (2003) trial, the study group showed significant improvement on the Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory (ECBI) between baseline and 6 months and between baseline and 12 months; this significant change over time was not evident for the two control groups. However, as the study group started with higher scores on the ECBI, it may be that there was more scope for change in this group. Indeed, wh en the authors controlled for these differences in baseline scores, the overall a nalysis of effect across the three groups in the trial showed no statistically significant difference in the extent of change between the groups. Other child outcomes Table 4.7 shows the other outcomes fo r children reported in the trials. Children's understanding of thei r parents' mental health One of the main elements in the 'clinician-led' psycho-e ducation programmes evaluated by Beardslee et al (2003) is the information gi ven directly to children about their parents' mental health condition. At the end of the 24 month follow- up, children's understanding had improved and there was a difference bet ween the two groups. However, other analysis had shown a strong relationship between improved children's understanding and the extent to which the parents' behav iour and attitude had changed. When this was controlled for in multi-variate analysis, differences between the two groups were no longer statistically significant. This suggests that either of the interventions tested is useful in changing children's level of understanding but this change is via parents' own changed behaviour and attitudes towards communication.

It is difficult to understand the analysis pres ented as the measure appears to be the numbers (and therefore proportions) of childr en reported as having 'more than a few problems' but the results are tested using t tests, which suggests some comparison of means. The paper does not clarify this issue but reports 'statistically significant' change between baseline and 12 weeks fo r both the initial interventi on group and the waiting list control group who started to re ceive the intervention after six weeks. However, as Table 4.7 shows, there was no 'main group effect'; in other words, no statistically significant difference at six weeks between the group that had received the psycho-educational intervention from the start of the trial and those who were in the waiting-list control group. Cognitive development One trial (Toth et al, 2006; Cichetti et al, 2000) reported the impac t of a toddler parent psychotherapeutic intervention on children's cognitive de velopment. Overall, the children in the three groups in the study (a depressed intervention group (DI), a depressed non-intervention control group ( DC), and a non-depressed comparison group (NDC)) showed statistically significant differe nces in overall, verbal and performance IQ scores at 36 months of age, after their le vel of cognitive development at baseline had been controlled for. In the case of the overall and verbal IQ scores, the DC children did worse than those in either the DI or NDC groups did. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups on their performance IQ scores. The authors argue, therefore, that the intervention allowed the child ren of depressed mothers to progress at a similar rate to that of their peer s whose mothers were not depressed. The authors tested the possibi lity that mothers' depression might be acting as an intervening factor here by carrying out further multi-variate analysis. The results from this, the authors suggest, show that the DI children 'maintained higher cognitive functioning whether or not t heir mothers had subsequent depressive episodes' (Cichetti et al, 2000: 143). However, as the analysis c ontrolled only for 'presence or absence of subsequent depressive episodes' rather than by any measure of length or level of depression, this possible effect remains to be confirmed in further research. Parenting outcomes Parenting behaviour Three trials (Sanders et al, 2000; Baydar et al, 2003; Beeber et al, 2004) report parenting behaviour out comes (Table 4.8).

However, the statistical approach used here compared change from baseline to follow-up within the groups, that is, it show ed statistically significant change in the study group but no signific ant change in the control group. Direct comparison of outcomes for the two gr oups was not possible, because this paper reported sub-group analysis of a larger trial which had not randomised mothers on the basis of their depressive symptoms, but carr ied out post-hoc analysis using depression as an exploratory variable. As is clear from the table, the researchers have not report ed their results on an intention to treat13 basis - that is, they have not included the results from those who dropped-out. On this basis, they argue that there ar e significant differences between study and control groups at follow-up, favouring the in tervention, in the pr oportions of children displaying secure or disorganised attachment behaviour in the 'Reactions to a Strange Situation' test. However, as is also clear from the table, and as discussed by the authors, the groups were significantly different in t heir attachment behaviour when assessed at baseline. Reanalysis of the results presented in the paper14 (and see Appendix 7) suggests that there are other possible expl anations for the findings. The depressed control (DC) group offered less scope for improvement than did the intervention group and this has not been accounted for in the analysis. No statistically significant differences between those receiving both CBT and a behavioural family intervention and those re ceiving only the behavioural intervention were reported in the Sanders et al (2000) trial. The Beeber et al (2004) trial (which was de scribed as a pilot study) reports percentage change in a range of behaviours wh ich, overall, favour the intervention; for example, mothers in the study group s howed more increases in touch, holding and staying near their children, expressing positive affect, sm iling, and the total number of interactions with their child in the observation period. Co nversely, they showed more decreases in passive, uninvolved observation of their child and the expression of negative affect. However, the observers who assessed thes e changes were aware of which group the mothers' were in. Further, none of the changes were tested for statistical significance. Mother and child relationship The only RCT to explore the mother and chil d relationship was the Toth et al (2006); Cichetti et al (2000) study. The trial focussed on the relationship between depressed mothers and their toddlers, with a specific, theoretically driven, focus on attachment. Reported outcomes thus concentrated on behavi ours in the child that were argued to show the strength of attachment between mo ther and child. Table 4.9 shows the results given in the relevant paper (Toth et al, 2006).

Discussion Limitations of the material revi ewed There are few firm conclusions that can be dr awn from the synthesis of ma terial from the 12 RCT s identified that address the question of the i mpact of interventions to support PMHPs, their children and family mem bers, largely becaus e of the limitations of the studies themselves. First, as sh own in Chapter 2, the trials reviewed here displayed a poor quality of reporting of methodological details and theref ore their quality score s are low. Further, only two trials (Baydar et al, 2003; Bear dslee et al, 2003) randomised more than 100 families or individuals, meani ng th at their power to detect statistically sign ificant difference was probably limited. Meta-analysis of results is one way to compensate for the lack of statistical power when several small trials are available, but in this review it was usually the case that where the same or similar outcomes were reported the interventions were different, and vice versa . Secondly, the lack of placebos or a comparativ e treatment of equivalent weight in most of the studies reviewed is a serious w eakness, given that these were apparently intended to be effectiveness trials. Other weak nesses in the reported quality of trials, particularly around blinded assess ment of out comes, high levels of drop-out and the subsequent analysis of data for missing subj ects, also limit the conclusions that can be drawn. The implic ation of poorly designed RCTs is t hat the effect of the intervention being tested is not accurately measured. However, this inaccur acy can be in two directions - over-estimating or under-estimating but there is no way we can judge in whic h direction for any given study. Thridly, there is very little 'saturation' of the results reported in the reviewed trials, as Table 4.2 shows. Some outcomes are reported only in one or two trials, and ev en the most often reported outcome ( parental mental health) in only six. Even oppor tunities for secure conclusions based narrative synthesis (rather than description) are, then, limited. 146 Overall concl usions from the st udies revi ewed If we confine ourselves to outcomes report ed in more than one trial, and taking some account of quality and possible placebo or Hawthorne effects, what conclusions can we draw from the studies re viewed in this chapter? 1. Impact on parental depr ession or depressive sy mptoms Two RCTs reviewed in this chapter suggest that CBT (Peden et al, 2005) and another cognitive-based intervention (Beeber et al , 2004) may reduce depr essive symptoms in mothers screened as 'at risk' for depression, compared to nothing else. However, with no placebo conditions, it is difficult to know whether it was the in tervention itself or simply the attention generated by receiving the intervention that caused the effect. Further, the reporting of the P eden trial was of low quality, a nd the Beeber trial, though with higher quality reporting, was a pilot study involving very small numbers. By contrast, compared against a placebo an d a 'no intervention' group in one trial (Verduyn et al, 2003) CBT appears to have had no significant effect on depression in mothers w hose children had behavioural pr oblems. Indeed, a mother and toddler club appeared as effective i n addressing depress ion in this trial. Similarly, when delivered alongs ide an existing family-focussed in tervention, CBT appears to add little to improved outcomes when depres sed mothers hav e children with behaviour difficulties (Sanders et al, 2000). In both these trials mothers had been assess ed as depressed against recognised clinical criteria. With a completely different focus, one trial (Nickel et al, 2005) s uggested that delivering psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care for depr essed mothers while their children are with them in an in-patient setting may impede their progress towards recovery. 2. Impact on children's mental health The relativ ely high-quality trial of CBT for the children of depressed parents who are themselves at risk for depression (Clarke et al, 2001) suggests that it may improve their overall mental health and reduce the risk of depr ession in the future. However, with no placebo condition it is impossible to know w hether this apparent effect is due to the intervention itself or si mply to giving the child ren some form of attention. The related trial of CBT for children alr eady over the clinic al threshold for depression (Clarke et al, 2002), suggests that it has no effect over and abov e 'normal care', which could inc lude other forms of mental healt h input. 3. Impact on children's behaviour None of the trials that used measures of child behav iour showed any statistically signific ant difference between children in th e intervention and control groups, although 147 in the case of the Beardslee et al (2003) trial the comparison was between different forms of delivery of a psycho-ed ucational intervention. In the Sanders et al (2000) and Verduyn et al (2003) tri als of CBT alongs ide another intervention, targeted at depressed mothers of children who had behaviour problems, ther e was no evidence of the behaviour of children in the in tervention groups improving any more than that of children in the control group(s). Sim ilarly, among the children of depressed parents who were themselves depressed or 'at risk' for depr ession, CBT appeared to have no additional effect on child behaviour, over and above t he improvement over ti me observed in all groups. 4. Impact on parenting There is some suggestion from a pilot RCT (Beeber et al, 2004) and secondary analysis of a larger trial (Baydar et al, 2003) that a 'depressive symptom intervention' and a parenting programme, respectively, can im prove aspects of mothers' parenting behaviour. Howev er, this conclus ion is necessar ily tentative given t he pilot nature of the first study, and the partial nature of the analysis carried out in the second. 148 Chapt er 5 Outcom es of services or interventions for parents with mental health probl ems and their f amilies: results from non-RCT studies Introduction This section of review two, question two re views the findings of non-RCT studies that reported quantitative outcomes of interventions to support PMHPs, their children or families. Twenty-five studies (publis hed in 2 7 papers) were inclu ded. Description of the service or intervention Table 5.1 summarises information about the serv ices or interventions evaluated in the non-RCT studies, the control cond itions that they were comp ared with (if any), for whom they were intended, and other details of their delivery or organisation. Further details of about the nature and intensity of the inte rventions are included in Appendix 8. Intervention and cont rol conditi on The 25 studies covered a very wide range of interventions. As Table 5. 1 shows, 22 studies were evaluat ions of single interventions or services, often exper imental or developmental in natur e. Eight of these involved some form of individual or group psychotherapy , ranging from Adlerian family therapy, through a therapeutic nursery to a CBT group intervention. There we re three psycho-education interventio ns, so described, one 'problem solv ing' intervention, a family coping skills intervention, a series of 'g roup meetings' with what seem ed to be a psycho-educational function, and a care management plus problem solving intervention. Two interventions focussed predominant ly on improving parent ing skills and two were of some form of residential treatment (not hospital). Finally in this group, there were two family support services - one that provided psy chother apy, psycho-education, parenting skills interventions, care management and various other services and one that focussed on parent training and generic s upport - and an assertive out reach service that was individually tailored to the needs of PMHPs. The other three studies examined the impact of more generic services in several different se ttings - psychiatric hospital wa rds, social wor k services, and homeless shelters. Only one of the 25 studies (Hye Ha and Ja Oh, 2006) had a control group as such; however, although this is described as a 'waiti ng list control group', there is no evidenc e in the paper that the control group ever re ceived the intervention. There is also no description of what, if any, care the control group was receivin g. Further, it is not clear 149 150 Another study (Free et al, 1996) was based on sub-group analysis of a large, longitudinal survey of mo thers, and compared depres sed mothers who had ever received any form of psychotherapy with depressed mothers who had not and a group of mothers without MHPs. The survey wa s not designed with intervention and control groups but analysed the receipt of psychotherapy post-hoc. how families were assigned to the intervention and control groups other than a statement in the paper that r andomisation was not possible. Finally, three studies refer to the use of comparative data from national or general populations (Bogard et al, 1999; Croake and Ke lly, 1985; Nielsen, 2005) but these data were not always used to make comparisons related to the effectiveness of the intervention being studied. In the majority of case s, then, the studies reviewed in th is section were not 'evaluations' in the sense that they compared an intervention or service with something else, whether usual care or some other type of interventio n. Rather, most were pre-test-post-test studies, assessing whether or not the intervention had an effect and, if so, how large that effect was. In other words, they are efficacy studies or, using the terms recommended by the Medical Research Coun cil (MRC, 2000) should be seen as phase II or exploratory trials. The problem with a ll such studies, of course, is ascribing causation when other factors, including Hawthorne or placebo effects and the simple passing of time, may also have been at play. Further, as the results of the quality assessment suggests (Table 2.6) the studies were predominantly of poor quality overall, in term s of their reporting, external and internal validity and selection bias (where this was relevant). Aims and focus of the service or intervention Given the variety of types of service or in tervention in the review ed studies, it is not surprising that their aims and focus also vari ed and, in most cases, were multiple, as Table 5.1 shows. Two main categories of aims are evident - treatment (six studies, five of which were focused on treatment for parents only and one treatment for both PMHPs and their children) and improvin g parenting skills (five studies). Four studies refer to promoting mental health or preventing parental MHPs, one of which also aimed to prevent MHPs in children, three to enabling parents to be reunited or to stay with their children, and three refer to delivering services . In several cases, interventions had more than one of these aims. Beyond these categor ies, however, the st ated aims of the services or interventions are very diverse.

While there is still an emph asis on parental depression (eight of the 25 studies are concerned solely with depression), 11 studies are about a range of MHPs, one is about schizophrenia alone, and two are about parents considered 'at risk' for MHPs. In all, 10 studies refer specifically to schizophrenia or 'schizophrenifor m disor der' as among the MHPs covered by the service or intervention. Three studies were unspecific about the type of PMHP covered. Overall, only 10 of the 25 studies were about a single type of MHP, making it difficult to know how far results of the ot her studies could be gener alised. Service deliver y and organi sation The ways in which MHPs were defined or m easured also varied considerably and, in most studies, were hardly describ ed at all in the papers reviewed. Fourteen services or interventions were s pecifically for mother s, one for fathers (although all the outcomes reported related to the mothers and children), and three for children. T he remaind er were described as being for parents or families altho ugh, in reality, most were about mothers. Three interventions were targeted specifically at the depressed mothers of children with behavioural problems (Hye Ha and Ja Oh, 2006) or who themselves were receiving psychiatric treatment (Swartz et a l, 2006; Verdeli et al, 2004) and one at families with 'family problems' as well as at le ast one parent with a MHP (Nielsen, 2005). Seventeen studies referred to t he age range of the children involved in the intervention or service and these varied widely - some si mply including all children between 0 and 16 or 18, others being much more restri cted i n their age range (see Table 5.1). Because of the diverse nature of the services and interventi ons included in this part of the review, the range of professionals deliver ing them was also wide, and varied from large, multi-disciplinar y teams to small, investigato r-led and delivered projects. The most commonly mentioned professionals involv ed in deliv ery were social workers or care managers (eight studies) followed by ps ychotherapists or generic counsellors (six) and psychologists (five). Nurses w ere involved in four studies and psychiatrists in three. Three interventions in volved gro up leaders or facilitators and two 'volunteers', in one case mothers (Waldo et al, 1987) and in the other unspecified 'mentors' (Orel et al, 2003). In three studies it was not clear who was delivering the inte rvention or service. Seven of the 25 studies did not record wher e the intervention or service was d elivered, although in two of these cases the resear ch was based on survey data. Where this information was reported, some type of forma l, mental health, 'out-patient' setting was the most often mentioned site (eight studies) followed by home (six). Four interventions or services used community setti ngs such as a church or hall and schools were involved in a further three. In one of the latter, the entire interventi on was delivered in a special school for teenage mothers. Three of the projects studied invo lved residential provision, 158 159 in one case (in the UK) a shelter for hom eless people and in two multi-disciplinary interventions delivered in a residential setti ng (both in the USA). Other settings were acute hospitals and a hospital/university psychology department. As these numbers suggest, several projects involved delivery at multiple sites. Location As with the RCTs reviewed in Chapter 4, studi es carried out in the USA also dominate this section (16/25). Five others were UK studies, one Korean, one Danish, one was carried out in both Canada and Au stralia, and one in Australia. Outcomes reported Tables 5.2a, b and c summarise the range of outcomes reported in the non-RCT studies for individual parents, children and 'families', respectively. Table 5.2a shows that for individual parents, the most commonly reported outcome was some aspect of their mental hea lth, whether assessed formally or by such indicators as admission to hospital. The next most commo n outcome reported was adherence to the intervention or service being ev aluated, which is perhaps not surprising given that many of the studies were described as pilot or feasibility studies. Other outcomes at the parental level were reported in relatively few studies and using different measures: parents' self-reported response to the interv ention or service (five), substance abuse (three), socio-economic outcomes (four), social life or functioning (four) and a range of other outcomes including service us e and criminal arrest (six). Table 5.2b shows that the repor ting of outcomes for children was limited: five studies reported aspects of the children's own psyc hological well-being, three reported child behaviour outcomes, and five ot her outcomes such as social functioning or education. Table 5.2c shows the family level outcomes that were reported, including parenting behaviour or skills (five studies), family functioning (four), cu stody or care of the child (eight), involvement with children's (socia l) services (one), and the mother-child relationship (two). In addition to these outcomes for parents, ch ildren and families reported in Tables 5.2a, b and c, five studies also reported some aspect of the costs of the service or intervention (Kendall and Peterson, 1996; Waldo et al, 1987; Papworth et Arkansas Table 5.2a: Parental repor ted in non-RCT studies of s ervices/inte rventions to support PMHPs and their families Study Indicators of parental mental health Self-reporte d response to intervention/ service Substance abuse/dual diagnosis Adherence Socio-economic parental outcomes Social life/functioning Other parent outcomes Alder, 2005 9 9 Income/household finance Employment/occupation Education/ tr aining 9 Bassett et al, 2001, 200 3 9 Serviceuse Chan ge in food skills Bogard et al, 1999 9 Brownrig g et al, 2004; Place et al, 2002 Brunette et al, 2004 9 9 9 Income/household finance Housing Card emil et al, 2005 9 9 Cowell et al, 2000 9 9 Croake an d Kelly, 1985 Free et al, 1996 Hanr ahan et al, 2005 9 9 9 Housing Criminal arrest Hawes and Cottrell, 1999 Hy Ha an d Ja Oh, 2006 9 9 Kendall and Peterson, 1996 9 9 Serviceuse 160 Study Indicators of parental mental health Self-reporte d response to intervention/ service Substance abuse/dual diagnosis Adherence Socio-economic parental outcomes Social life/functioning Other parent outcomes Nielsen, 200 5 Not given 2 000 Emerson-Da vis Family Developmen t Center 9 9 Service use 9 9 Not given 2 002 Arkansas CARES 9 Income/ household finance Employment/ occupation Housing Not given 2 003 FSS/P ACE programme Orel et al, 2003 Papworth et al, 2001 9 Pasquariella, 1996 9 9 Pitman and Matthey, 200 4 9 Sheppa rd, 2004 Service use Relevance of services received Swartz et al, 2006 9 9 9 Quality of life Verdeli et al, 2004 9 9 9 Waldo et al, 1987 9 9 Serviceuse 161 Table 5.2b: Outcomes for children reported in non-RCT studies of service s/interventions to support PMHPs and their families Stud y Psychologi w Child behaviour Other omes Alder, 2005 Bassett et al, 2001, 2003 Bogard et al, 1999 Brownrigg et al, 2004 Place et al, 2002 9 9 Brunette et al, 2004 Cardemil et al, 2005 Cowell et al, 2000 9 Croake and Kelly, 1985 9 Free et al, 1 996 Social funct ioning Hanrahan et al, 2005 Education Hawes and Cottrell, 199 9 Hye Ha and Ja Oh, 2006 9 Kendall and Peterson, 1996 Nielsen, 200 5 Not given 2000 Emerson-Davis Family Developme nt Center Not given 2002 Arkansas CARES Not given 2003 FSS/PACE programme 9 Orel et al, 2003 9 Knowledge of MHPs Life skills Papworth et al, 2001 Pasquariella , 1996 Pitman and Matthey, 20 04 Knowledge of MHPs Life skills Sheppard, 2004 Swart et al, 2006 Verdeli et al, 2004 9 Social funct ioning Waldo et al, 1987 162 163 Table 5.2c: Parenting and family l evel outcomes reported in non-RCT studi es of services/interventions to support PMHPs and their families Study Parenting Family functioning Custody/care of children Involvement with children's (social) services Mother-child relationship Alder, 2005 9 Bassett et al, 2001, 2003 9 Bogard et al, 1999 Brownrigg et al, 2004; Place et al, 2002 9 Brunette et al, 2004 9 9 Cardemil et al, 2005 Cowell et al, 2000 9 Croake and Kelly, 1985 9 Free et al, 1996 9 Hanrahan et al, 2005 9 Hawes and Cottrell, 1999 9 Hye Ha and Ja Oh, 2006 9 9 Kendall and Peterson, 1996 Nielsen, 2005 9 Not given 2000 Emerson-Davis Family Development Center 9 9 Not given 2002 Arkansas CARES Not given 2003 FSS/PACE programme 9 Orel et al, 2003 9 Papworth et al, 2001 Pasquariella, 1996 9 Pitman and Matthey, 2004 Sheppard, 2004 9 Swart et al, 2006 Verdeli et al, 2004 Waldo et al, 1987 9 164 Three studies of psychotherapeutic inte rventions reported change in parental depression as an outcome (Hye Ha and Ja Oh, 2006 - group CBT, Swartz et al, 2006; Verdeli et al, 2004 - both interpersonal psychotherapy). All three demonstrated statistically significant improvement in depr ession (and, where measured, anxiety) over time. This is perhaps as would be expected, given the current evidence base for the effectiveness of these two forms of psychot herapy on depressive symptoms in the short term (see, for example, Ward et al, 2000; Butler et al, 2006). However, it is important to remember that only the Hye Ha and Ja Oh (2006) study had any form of control group. Outcomes for parents Parental mental health and well-being Table 5.3 summarises findings from the 14 non-RCT studies that reported parental mental health or well-being as an outcome. In this table, we have loosely grouped the projects according to the overall focus of the intervention - in this case, broadly psycho- educational, broadly psychotherapeutic, parenting skills or problem solving, and 'other'. We acknowledge that this is an imperfect categorisation, given that some projects delivered more than one of these types of interv ention and that in others the intervention was poorly described. Two studies of interventions with a broadly psycho-educational approach (Cowell et al, 2000; Papworth et al, 2001) report data in such a way that MHPs can be compared before and after the intervention. These sug gest positive change over time in parental MHPs, in the first case as measured by a generic screening tool for a range of MHPs and in the other as measured by both a depression and an anxiety screening tool. Further, two of the same studi es, reported no significant change in at least one of the measures of MHPs employed. In the Verdeli et al (2004) study, while both depression measures showed significant change over time , the Global Impressions of Severity of Illness Scale did not. Of the st udies without a control group incl uded in this section this was the strongest as it adopted an intention to treat approach to analysis, using the last obtained score for study partici pants, regardless of whether or not they had completed the course of psychotherapy. In the Hye Ha and Ja Oh (2006) study, paired t-test comparison of the results of the Automatic Thoughts Questi onnaire for the intervention group did not reached conventional levels of statistical significance, although the authors report the findings as su ch. A group x time effect is also claimed, tested by analysis of variance. This suggests the possibility that the intervention and the (unmatched) control group bot h improved over time, although at different rates. Unfortunately, scores for the two gr oups are not reported in the paper.

Cardemil et al (2005) report a statistically signific ant reduction in Beck Depression Inventory scores of four points (from a mean of 11.21, mild to moderate depr ession) to a mean of 7.21, normal 'ups and downs'). However, this result is based only on the 24/33 parents who actually completed the programme. If the data are reanalysed on an intention to treat basis and assuming no chan ge for those who did not complete, the reduction in symptoms is larger (5.24) but moves fr om a mean of 14.41 (mild to moderate depression) to a mean of 9.17 (mild to moder ate depression). This suggests both that the more depressed parents were more likel y not to complete the programme, and that the overall effect of the programme was to reduce symptoms but not to bring parents below a mild to moderate depression threshol d. In the Brunette et al (2004) study, a reduction in symptoms, as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory, is evident but no statistical test is reported. Conversely, there was an apparent increase in parental stress but, again, no statisti cal test is reported. Claims in other studies in this sub-group for change in the numbers or rate of psychiatric hospital admissions (Alder, 2005; Emerson-Davis FDC, 2000; Bassett et al, 2001, 2003) are difficult to evaluate with no control condi tions or formal before and after testing. Finally, the results of a post-hoc analysis of data on homeless mothers using shelters (Bogard et al, 1999) suggest t hat the number of meetings that mothers have with caseworkers is associated with lower levels of depression, once a number of relevant intervening variables have been taken into a ccount. However, it is impossible to say anything about causation from this analysis. Self-reported response to the intervention Four non-RCT studies (Brunette et al, 2004; Cowell et al, 2000; Swartz et al, 2006; Alder, 2005) reported data on par ents' own response to the intervention (Table 5.4). The first three of these reported users' sa tisfaction with the intervention and all three showed relatively high levels of satisfac tion among those completing the programmes. The fourth reported par ents' own, informal assessment of their mental health status on joining the programme and 'after engagement' wit h it. The findings ar e reported in such a way that it is difficult to judge exactl y how much change had taken place over time and whether or not the two people reporting that they were 'not coping' after engagement had also reported 'not coping' at the beginning. 173 Table 5.4: Self-reported respon se to intervention in non-RCT studies Study Intervention/ control condition Measure used When measured Results for intervention group Mean (SD where given) unless otherwise stated Within group comparison - statistical test results and reported significance Quality Cowell et al, 2000 Problem solving nursing intervention/ None% satisfied using perceived satisfaction rating scale developed for study Post-intervention 95.8% support received 94% 'Stop, Think and Act' steps 85.9% amount of control had over intervention n/a 21 Not given 2000 Emerson-Davis Family Development Center Family residential development centre/None% satisfied with service received Not clear 60% 'very satisfied' 33% 'satisfied' n/a 2 family treatment/NoneSatisfaction rating scale A-F 12m Average score of A n/a 41 Alder, 2005 Assertive outreach programme/NoneSelf-reported mental health status 9/13 psychotherapy/ NoneCSQ session After 8th 29.6 (3.7) (n=11/13) n/a 29 CSQ Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 174 Substance use Three studies (Hanrahan et al, 2005; Emerson-Davis FDC, 2000; Arkansas CARES, 2002) reported outcomes in relation to subst ance use, one of whic h was specifically about parents with dual diagnoses. Although results suggesting improvement are reported (Table 5.5) these are difficult to a scribe to the intervention given the lack of control groups, before and after measurement, or statistical tests. Two studies suggest better outcomes for parents who completed the interventions than for those who did not, but without knowing whether thes e parents were otherwise equiva lent it is difficult to know what to make of these findings. As our reanalysis of the Hanrahan et al (2005) study results shows (see Table 5.5), inclus ion of drop-outs makes claims for the effectiveness of the intervention more difficult to maintain. Adherence to the intervention or service As the previous paragraph suggests, drop-out from or poor adherence to the interventions being studied was a significant pr oblem in some projects. Eight of the 25 studies formally reported drop-out and adherence (Table 5.6) but did so at different points - both at the end of and during the intervention. For example, Hanrahan et al (2005) report drop out six and 12 months after entry to the programme, Pasquariella (1996) reports drop out 'during treatment', Hye Ha and Ja Oh (2006), before and in the early stages of treatment, and Pitman and Matthey (2004) at the end of a three-day programme. Overall, drop-out or incomplete adherence seems high - ranging from 12.5 per cent after 11 months in one study (Brunette et al, 2004) to 55.2 per cent who terminated treatment 'prematurely' in another (Kendall and Peterson, 1996). Most of the authors point to the wider literature that descr ibes the difficulties of engaging PMHPs, particularly those with dual di agnoses, in intervention programmes. However, as we saw in Chapter 4, some RCTs managed to retain substantial proportions of PMHPs in the studies. The wider range of MHPs included in the studies in this section could, perhaps, have had a role to play in higher ra tes of drop-out, but poor quality design may also have had a role to play. Other outcomes for parents Twelve studies reported a number of other outcomes for parents, the most common of which related to aspects of daily living such as housing, employment or income, but also social life, quality of life and aspects of access to, use of or reaction to service provision (Tables 5.7 and 5.7a).

Howeve r, those who dropped out from the latter programme had much poorer em ployment outcomes 12 months after 'discharge' from the programme than those who completed it. T hese same studies also reported positive changes in income or household finances , which were presumably related to improvements in employment. A third study, of integrated fa mily treatment for parents with 'severe psychiatric difficulties' r eported a negative change in household income (Brunette et al, 2004) but this was neit her commented on nor ex plained in the paper. The three studies that repor ted housing outcomes (Brunette et al 2004, Hanrahan et al, 2005 (a care management and problem solvi ng intervention for homeless mothers with MHPs), Arkansas CARES, 2002) all suggest improvement for participants, either in housing satisfaction or the proportion no l onger homeless or living in shelters. Aspects of social life - whether leisure ac tivities, social networks or more formal measurement of social functioning - are report ed in four studies (Alder, 2005; Swartz et al, 2006 (brief interpersonal psychotherapy fo r depressed mothers of children receiving psychiatric treatment); Pasquar iella, 1996 (therapeutic unit for mother with 'severe and chronic' MHPs); Verdeli et al, 2004 (interpersonal psychotherapy )). Reporting of the results is generally poor, but all studies clai m improvement over time, as does the single study that used a more globa l, formal quality of life measure (Swartz et al, 2006). Five studies (Emerson-Davies FDC, 2000; Bassett et al, 2001, 1996; Waldo et al, 1987; Sheppar d, 2004) reported varied aspects of engagement with and response to services. Wi th the exception of Sheppard (2004) - reported separately in Table 5.7a - none went beyond descriptive accounts. Alder (2005) also report ed a high proportion of partici pants entering education or training or starting on new career paths. The Sheppard (2004) study invo lved post-hoc analysis of a survey of users of family and children's services in the UK. This ex amined a number of ex pressed needs among mothers who were depressed and the rela tionship between these needs and the work social workers reported doing wi th the mothers. Similar analysi s looking at services from other agencies is also presented. The anal ysis distinguished between those needing help with a range of issues 'a little' from those needing help 'quite a bit'. As Table 5.7a shows, in most cases mot her expressing a higher level of need received more help than those expressing a lower leve l of need. However, the bivariate analysis employed throughout the paper makes it diffi cult to understand the extent to which individuals had needs met in total .

Two studies reported on children's depre ssion, as was appropriate perhaps in a preventive intervention (Cowell et al, 2000) and an intervention targeted at the depressed mothers of childr en being treated for depression (Verdeli et al, 2004). While Cowell et al (2000) report ed significant positive change in the Child Depression Inventory (a self-report measure) from pre-test to post-te st, the Verdeli et al (2004) study, which employed more sophisticated analysis based on intention to treat, did not. Neither did the Verdeli et al (2004) study show change on the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity scale. However, th is study did show significant change from baseline to 12 weeks on the Hamilton Depr ession Rating Scale (a clinician-rated measure). One other study, of a mult i-component, family support service (FSS/PACE, 2003) reported a mental hea lth outcome, but it is difficult to interpret the finding that children in 27/29 families experienced 'f ewer' or no admissions to a psychiatric hospital or residential placement. The other outcomes reported in this section a ll relate to children's self-esteem or self- worth. Brownrigg et al (2004) and Place et al (2002) report that a psycho-education intervention for parents with MHPs and their children is associat ed with significant positive change from bas eline to post-intervention on some sub-scales of the Self- Description Questionnaire: physical appear ance, peer relations, academic and non- academic performance, and the total score. Orel et al (2003) also report positive change associated with a psycho-educational intervent ion for the children of MHPs, both in overall self-esteem and in sub-scales of t he Self Esteem Index relating to familial acceptance, academic competence, peer popular ity and personal security. No statistical tests are presented for these results, but they are standardis ed against a general population of children and presented as percentiles. Finally , Cowell et al (2000) report no significant change on overall m easures of Child Health Self Concept and Global Self Worth, after mothers deemed 'at risk' of MHPs received a nurse-led problem solving intervention.

All report both total sco res and some report sub-scale scores. Brownrigg et al (2004) and Plac e et al (2002) report signif icant positive change for the children of depressed parents between pre-test and post-test on pro-social behaviour, hyperactivity, and total deviancy score on the SDQ and on particip ation in groups on the CBCL- C. This latter change is not surprisi ng given that a lar ge part of the psycho- educational intervention was group based for the children involved. Croake and Kelly (1985) repor t results for the children of depressed and schizophrenic fathers separately, and show that both improv ed signific antly over time on the overall CBC-O and CBC-B s cores after Adlerian Family Therapy int ended to help the fathers adjust to fa mily life after returning from hospital. Finally, Hye Ha and Ja Oh (2006) report statisti cally significant differences from pre-test to post-test between their intervention (g roup CBT for depressed mothers) and their 'waiting list control' group. Thes e are reported for the K-CBCL total behaviour problems score, as w ell as the externalising problems sub-scale, but the internalising problems score is not referred to at all, and the soci al competence score is not reported but is said to be not signific antly different statis tically. This study also reported change from pre-intervention to follow up three months after the intervention. Here the tota l behaviour problems score was said still to be pos itively and significantly different for the intervention group but not for t he control group. Howev er, nei ther the externa lising nor the internalising problems scores remained signific antly different, w hile the soc ial competence score for t he intervention group had beco me different, when it w as not at post-intervention testing. Partial reporting of results, no details abo ut the control group, and a confusing text make it diffi cult to assess exactly what happened in this study. Knowledge of ment al health problems Psycho-educational interventions that include the children of PMHPs usually involve an element that aims to i mprove their under standing or knowledge about MHPs. Three non-RCT studies were of this type but only two of them (Pitman and Matthey, 2004; Orel et al, 2003) actually reported change in children's knowled ge of MHPs. As Table 5.10 shows , Pitman and Matthey (2004) report significant change15 in children 's knowledge about a number of aspects of MHPs. The only area where there w as no signific ant change was in relation to understandi ng about what schizophrenia is. Orel et al (2003) report a much more limited outcome - the proportion of children 'able to name different types of illne sses' - and do not repo rt any pre-interventio n results. After the 191 192 intervention 70 per cent of t he 11 children who took part were reported to be able to name different types of illnesses. Two psycho-educational interventions that included children reported some aspects of life skills. Orel et al (20 03) report that all the 11 ch ildren who participated in the intervention were able to verbalise or demonstrate a 'crisis management plan' related to their parent's MHP, but no pre-intervention re sults are given. Pitm an and Matthey (2004) report the results of a large number of life skill questions from a 'Life Skills Measure', all but one of which (ability to be creative) show statistically significant change from pre- to post-intervention 16. Other outcomes The remainder of outcomes reported for childr en can be classified broadly as life skills, social functioning and educ ation (see Table 5.10). Two studies report some aspects of social func tioning as outcomes. Verdeli et al (2004) used the Social Adjustment Inventor y for Children and the Children's Global Assessment Scale to measure change in children after their depressed mothers received interpersonal psychotherapy. Neither measure showed significant change from baseline to follow-up in random regression analysis. Free et al (1996) examined how accurate children were in their reporting of observed negative and positive affective language and compared those whose depressed mothers had received psychotherapy, those whose depressed mot hers had not received psychotherapy, and those whose mothers were not depressed. This com parison was based on post-hoc, sub-group analysis of a large survey, rather than direct evaluation of an intervention. The analysis of variance reported suggests that there were differences between the three groups in relation to negative affective language, but that the main difference was between the children of depressed mothers who had not received psychotherapy and those whose mothers were not depressed. The results for positive affective language were not significantly different between the groups, although the combined results (presumably driven by the negative affective language score s) were. In this latter case, two-way analysis showed the children of depress ed mothers who had received psychotherapy and the children of non-depressed mothers both had significantly better results than the children of depressed mothers w ho had not received psychotherapy. Finally in this sub-section, one study (H anrahan et al, 2005) reported how many children were enrolled in school afte r their mothers had participat ed in a case management and problem solving intervention. Six months after embarking on t he programme all 26 children in their mother's care were in sc hool, 47 per cent of whom were in special educational provision of some sort. This study was in the USA, making its relevance to the UK context difficult to judge.

The overall conclu sion from this study is that mothers expressing higher levels of need are, generally, little more likely to have that need met than are mothers expressing lower levels of need. However, it is impossible to ascribe any causative link here or, indeed, to speculat e about any possible direction of the link. This is clear from the results in relation to mothers who said that they needed help with the long-term care of their children. Here those requiring 'a little' he lp were significantly more likely to receive that help than those needing help 'quite a bit'. As Sheppard (2004) suggests, this may be because those with lower levels of need already had their children in long-term care. Parenting outcomes Five non-RCT studies reported some aspect of parenting as an outcome, all using different measures. Three used some form al measure of parenting behaviour, two of which reported statistical testing of change fr om baseline to follow-up. Croake and Kelly (1985) reported statistically significant pos itive change in maternal attitudes towards child rearing and child-rearing practices after family therapy, and that these changes were similar in families where the fa ther was depressed and those where he had schizophrenia. They also claimed similar pat terns of change to those seen in mothers from a general population enrolle d in 'parent study groups'. Hye Ha and Ja Oh (2006) claimed significant change in an aspect of pa rental sense of competence (possibly the anxiety sub-scale) after group CBT, but did not report the results of any of the other parenting measures they used in their study. This suggests, perhaps, that no other measures showed positive change. The th ird study that used a formal measure (Brunette et al, 2004) reported mean val ues on the home environment measure 12 months after parents with seve re psychiatric difficulties received integrated family treatment; these were higher t han at baseline, but no statis tical testing was reported. The report of the Emerson-Davi es FDC (2000) - a residential family centre - claimed that parental 'level of functioning scales' in relation to parenting skills and parental activities of daily living were significantly higher at discharge from the scheme, but no results were reported directly. Family level outcomes Thirteen non-RCT studies r eported outcomes relating to some aspect of family functioning or stru cture (Table 5.12). Family functioning Four studies reported family functioning as an outcome using formal measures, though none of them used the same one.Table 5.11: Parenting outco mes reported in non-RCT studies Stud y Interv ention/contr ol condition Measur When measure d Resul ts for interv ention group Mean * (S D where giv en) unless other wise stated Resul ts for contr ol group Mean (SD) Between groups comparison - statistical te st results a nd reported significanc e Within grou p comparison - statistical te st results a nd reported significanc e Qualit y Croake and Kelly, 1985 Fam ily Therapy/No but used com parative 2.29 2.16 No difference betwe en two groups in progress, and also simila r to mothers from gene ral popul ation enroll ed in parent study groups When measure d Resul ts for interv ention group Mean * (S D where giv en) unless other wise stated Resul ts for contr ol group Mean (SD) Between groups comparison - statistical te st results a nd reported significanc e Within grou p comparison - statistical te st results a nd reported significanc e = 4.66, p<.001.

Calcul ated by us from n umbers give n in paper List of ab breviations FACES II Family Adaptability and Co herence Evaluation Scal Feetham F amily Function Survey Reporting of results w as generally poor. For example, Cowell et al (2000) report no signific ant change in a family functioning measure but then repr esent the results excluding the one mother whose scores had deteriorated. Nielsen (2005) claims a number of statistically signific ant, posit ive changes in su b-scales of a family environment measure but presents neither the direct results nor th e t statistic for the paired t test. Orel et al (2003), conversely, present direct resu lts but no statistical testing. Brownrigg et al (2004) and Place et al (2002), however , report both mean scores and the results of statistica l testing. Overall, there is no consistent message fr om these four studies . One psycho-education intervention for depressed parents and their child ren (Brownrigg et al, 2004; Place et al, 2002) showed highly signific ant change ov er time in family adapt ability and cohesion. Another - for the children of parents with a range of MHPs (Orel et al, 2003) - showed a mixed patt ern of improvement, no change and increas ed dysfunction across different sub-scales and with dif ferent resul ts for child ren's and parents' judgements. The areas where both parents and children reported improvement were affective expression, family control, and family values and norms. A problem-solving, nursing intervention for Mexican American mothers 'at ri sk' of depression (Cowell et al, 2000) showed no change in total family functioning. By contrast , a family therapy intervention for families with 'family problems' and at least one par ent with a MH P (Nielsen, 1996) claimed signific ant change in r elation to family cohesion, expressiv eness, independence, achievement orientation and recreational or ientation and no significant change in relation to family conflict, organisation, cont rol and 'intellectual cult ural orientation'. Children's place of residence or care placement Eight non- RCT studies reported children's place of residence or placement in 'care' as outcomes. The messages from thes e studies were very mixed. The Brunette et al (2004) study (of integr ated family treatment with parents with severe psychotic or mood disorders) and the Hanrahan et al (2005) study (o f care management and problem solving for homeless mother wi th MHPs) reported poorer outcomes, in terms of separation of children from their birth families, over the time of the intervention . By contrast, the Waldo et al (1987) study of a parenting and early intervention project for mothers with schizophrenia and the FSS/ PACE (2003) family support programme, for PMHPs who had experienced 'intensiv e' psychiatric treatment, reported improvements in the proportions of childr en living with their familie s after the intervention. Three other studies reporting outcomes in this general area did not give formal 'before and after' fi gures. Pasquariella (1996) claim ed that all children of parents with severe and chronic MHPs who had attended a therapeutic nursery were living with their parents six to 12 months after the intervention. Alder (2005) reported t hat three out of 13 parents with severe and enduring MHPs said t hat the support of an assertive outreach programme was central in their being able to retain custody of their children. T he residential centre that work ed wit h mothers with MHPs and a history of homel essness 218 (Emerson-Davis FDC, 2000) was said to have resulted in 63 childr en being reunited with 45 families over the period (unspecified) being desc ribed. The final study in this sub-section (Haw es and Cottrell, 1999) reported what happened to children when their mothers w ere admitte d to acute psychiatric care. Four out of 40 children of married mothers had to move from their homes during thei r mother's hospita l stay, while eight (or possibly nine - the t able and text are contr adictory) out of 13 children of lone mothers had to do so. Involvement w ith childr en's and families services One study of a parenting skills programme for parents with a 'major' MHP (Bassett et al, 2001, 2003 ) reported the number of parents i nvolved with children 's and familie s services. Although not specified in the publis hed papers, the implic ation appears to be that there were anxiet ies about childc are in these families. Before the intervention, 11 out of 34 parents had such contact. After the intervention six out of 34 parents were said to have regained 'full residency of the ch ildren', while one parent had been exc luded from the intervention because her child had been placed in 'permanent foster care'. Mother and child relationship Only two non-RCT studies reported any aspect of the relations hip between mothers and their childr en as outcomes (Table 5.13). Free et al (1996), in post-hoc analysis of a large survey, compared depressed mothers who had received psy chotherapy with those who had not and with mothers w ho were not depressed. Analy sis of variance test ed differences across the three groups and found these were statistically significant in relation to the accuracy of mother's communication of negative affect to her child. However, pai red t tests showed that the difference between the depressed mothers who had not received psychotherapy and the mothers who were not depressed account ed for this difference. The three groups were not significantly different overall in relation to the co mmunication of positive affect. When the scores for negative and positive affect were combined, the overall analys is of variance again showed significant differences (presuma bly driven by the results for negative affect) and the paired t tests this ti me showed that the depressed mothers who did not receive psychotherapy were significant ly less accurate in overall com munication of affective language than both the other two groups. Hye Ha and Ja Oh (2006) used measures of parent and child interaction and parts of the Social Adjustment Scale to examine ch ange in mother and child relations hips after depressed mothers participated in group CBT . As discussed earlier, results in this study were reported only par tially. There was a signifi cant group by time interaction in relation to mothers' punishing or coercive behaviour towards their children, although no main effect for group was reported. Rather, pair ed t tests were said to show that the intervention group improved while the waitin g list control group did not. Results for 219 220 Finally, a statistically significant group by time effect was reported for the parent and child relationship sub-scale of the So cial Adjustment Scale, along with another significant paired t test for the intervention group. Discussion Limitations of the material reviewed As we pointed out at the beginning of th is chapter, most of the non-RCT studies included here were not evaluations of one intervention compared to another, or even of an intervention compared with 'usual care'. Rather, most were apparently set up to assess whether a particular intervention had some sort of effect, using a pre-test-post- test design. In other words, they were simple efficacy studies or, using the terms recommended by the Medical Research Counc il (MRC, 2000) should be seen as (very early in our view) phase II or exploratory trials. The problem with all such studies, of course, is ascribing causation when other factors, including Hawthorne or placebo effects and the simple passing of time, may also have been involved. another element of parent and child interaction - respect for the child's opinion - were also reported and, again, a signi ficant group by time interaction effect was shown. However, the paired t test for the intervent ion group this time showed a difference that was below conventional levels of statistical significance. Costs Five studies referred to some aspect of the co st of providing or using the interventions described. As Table 5.14 shows, these dat a are very limited and in no case can be considered adequate for formal cost com parison with other methods of supporting PMHPs. It is possible to do well-designed research without a control group to assess whether an intervention appears to have an effect. Interr upted time series (ITS) designs, where primary outcomes are measur ed on a number of occasions (at least three) before intervention and then after (again, on at leas t three occasions) are intended to deal with exactly this sort of question. However, none of the non-RCT studies without a control group reviewed here described themselves as ITS studies and none had the design features that would be necessary to allo w us to describe them as good quality ITS studies (see EPOC, 2002).

The most that can be said of all but one of the studies, then, is that the interventions are associated with some changes in outcomes over time, but not that the intervention caused these changes. The one study that did have a 'control group' was so poorly reported that no claims for relative effectiveness could be made. Further, as the results of t he quality assessment suggests (Table 2.6) the studi es were predominantly of poor quality overall, in term s of their reporting, external and internal validity and selection bias (where this was re levant). Onl y two studies (Bogard et al, 1999; Verdeli, 2004) scored a mean of 50 or over (out of 100) on the quality assessment tool used17, and a further three (Brunette et al, 2004; Free et al, 1996; Pitman and Matthey, 2 004) between 33 and 49. Overall conclusions from the non-RCT studies reviewed Finally, most of the non-RCT studies reviewed were very small. As Table 2.3 showed, only one study (Bogard et al, 1999) involved more than 100 parents or familie s, and this included those who did not have MHPs as we ll as those who did. In all, 11 studies involv ed 25 or fewer parents or families. Given the limitations outlined a bove, there is little robust evidence to glean from the studies reviewed and s ynthesised in this chapter. In this final secti on, then, we confine ourselves to outcomes that were reported in more than two studies, where the studies had a mean quality score of more than 33 (out of 100). The five studies inc luded here were: Bogard et al (1999) which explored the im pact of shelters for homeless families on PMHPs. Brunette et al (2004) which explored the impact of integrated fami ly treatment on parents with severe psychiatric difficulties. Free et al (1996) whic h explored t he impact of psychotherapy on depressed mothers. Pitman and Matthey (2 004) which expl ored the impact of a psycho-educational programme for children of parents with MHPs. Verdeli et al (2004) which explored t he impact of interpersonal psy chotherapy on mothers being treated for clinically diagnosed depression. 1. Impact on parental mental health problems Three studies of slightly hi gher quality reported parental mental health as an 'outcome'. These wer e: Bogard et al (1999), Brunette et al (2004) and Verdeli et al (2004). Only Verdeli et al (2004) reported statistically signif icant impr ovement in parental mental health over time associated with the mothers' receipt of interpersonal psychotherapy. 225 Given the current evidence base for the effect iveness of various forms of psychotherapy for depressive symptoms (see, for example, Ki ng et al, 2000), the finding from Verdeli et al (2004) is hardly surprising. There is no obvious reas on to suppose that parents would react to such interventions in a different way from any other adults. Indeed, given that many non-elderly adults are parents, one must assume that most, rigorous, controlled evaluations of psychotherapeutic interventions have inc luded parents in their samples. Howev er, without control groups , this study cannot tell us whether change over time would have taken place for these parents anywa y, or whether the intervention studied was any better or worse than any other intervention or 'usual care'. 2. Adherence to the int ervention Three studies of relatively higher qualit y reported adherence to the intervention being studied. These were Brunette et al (2004), Pitman and Matthey 2004), and Verdeli (2004). Drop-out rates in these better designed studies were still high - rangin g between 12.5 per cent and 32 per cent. 3. Impact on aspects of ch ildren's social functioni ng Two studies of relatively higher quality reported impact on some aspect of children's social functioning. Verdeli et al (2004) reported no signif icant change in the two measures of social functioning used for children whos e mothers had receiv ed interpersonal psychotherapy. Free et al ( 1996) reported that child ren whose depressed mothers had received psychotherapy were mo re accurate in their recognition and reporting of 'negative affect' language but no mo re accurate in their recognition and reporting of 'positive affect' language, com pared to children whose depressed mothers had not received psyc hotherapy or childr en whose mothers were not depressed. Howev er, as reported earlier, this study was based on post-hoc analysis of results from a much larger, longitudinal study. This further synthesis of outcomes report ed by more than one of the slightly higher quality non-RCT studies does not seem to add anything to our earlier conclus ion that there is little robust evidence to be gleane d from this el ement of this review. 226 Notes 1. The project team did not want to predefine the notion of accessibility, as part of the work of the review was to identify factors that affect or contribute to accessibilit y. Howev er, aspects of service access covered by this review included physical, social, organisational, geograph ical/location, cultural an d economic factors. Both users and professional views on access we re examined. Similarly , it was not possible to pre-define acceptabilit y, as par t of the work of the review was to identify factors that affect ed or contributed to what makes a service acceptable. Users', family members' and professionals' views on acceptability were examined. 2. The words 'service' and 'intervention' are loosely def ined and inconsistently used by practitioners and academics alike. The project team' s understanding of these terms is that an intervention is a discrete ac tivity that can be defined in terms of its methods and purpose (though the specificit y of this definition varies from intervention to intervention). Services are typically made up of one or more interventions, which are not necessarily pr ovided or delivered in an identical way to every user. As defined in the commissi oning brief, interventions or services include those provided by children's, adul ts and family services which 'sup port children, whole familie s, parenting and/or couple relatio nships in fa milies with children, where a parent already has an MHP' (SCIE, 2006: 4) and these may be provided by, among others, health, social services, education/early years and the voluntary sector. In addition, the review excludes all physical, pharmacologic al or physiologic al clinical interventions. 3. As in the SCIE commissioning brief (p.4 ) children were defined as: 'children 18 years or younger, some of whom will be \"young carers\"'. 4. For the purposes of this work parent s were defined as in the SCIE commissioning brief (p.4): ' mothers, fat hers, adoptive parents, legal gu ardians, foster parents, and all adults with a primary caring respons ibility for a dependent child aged 18 years or younger, whether resident or non-resident .' 5. The definition of 'ment al health pr oblem' was that laid down in the SCIE commissioning brief (p.4) and comprised 'primary diagnosis/symptoms/need identified as a mental health problem' including self-ide ntification of mental health problems by parents. For t he purpose of these reviews, and as set down in the commissioning brief, mental health problems did not include ' sole diagnoses of substance misuse, ante-natal or post-nat al depression, mental health problems during pregnancy and up to six months afte r birth, or Munchaus en's Syndrome by Proxy ' (p.4). Further, apar t from the additional searc hes carried out by the York team, no terms designed to identify ma terial about parents with personality disorders were used in the searches. In the event, no papers about personality disorder were selected from these additional searches. 227 6. Outcomes were defined by the resear ch team as anything that happens to a service user and/or family members as a result of any intervention or service which is reported by research. Clear ly, the evidence on the outcomes of interventions or services were limited to the outcomes reported by researchers, and the way in which outcomes were m easured or recorded. This may not, therefore, present a complete picture of the outcomes of services/interventions used by parents with MHPs and/ or family members. 7. Structured enquiry inc luded audit s, inspections and other structured activity that was not research. 9. The quality criterion of double-blinded asses sment is clearly not achievable in studies where the alternative to the in tervention being evaluated is nothing or 'usual care'. As in previous systematic re views of models of care carried out by the York group (Parker et al, 2000; Parker et al, 2006) we theref ore used a truncated version of the Jadad criteria. 14. Our rerunning of the chi-squared test (see A ppend ix 7), which examined the distribution of attachment types across a ll three groups, shows that certain cells were more important in infl uenc ing the statistically signi ficant difference than were others. The much higher proportion of 's ecure' children in the non-depressed control groups and the lower proportion of 'secure' children in the depressed intervention group, along with a much sma ller proportion of 'disorganised' children in the non-depressed control gr oup, contributed a very lar ge part of the variation observed at baseline (see Table A7.1). As a corollary, the proportion of 'secure' 8. The protocol for this review stated that we would inc lude all study types for thi s question. Once the material had been se lected and read it became clear that studies that did not include any comparativ e data were of little use in examining the impact of interventions. The select ion criteria for this question were consequently refined in relation to study type such that only RCTs or other, non- RCT comparative studies were included. 10. 'Narrative synthesis' refers to an approach to the systematic review and synthesis of findings from multiple studies that re lies primarily on the use of words and text to summari se and explain the findings of the synthesis. Whilst narrative synthesis can involv e the manipulation of statistical dat a, the defining characteristic is that it adopts a textual approach to the process of synthesis to 'tell the story' of the findings from the included studies (Popay et al, 2006: 5). 11. These are just examples of possibl e support needs. The scope of the searches conducted for this review did not include per ceived needs. 12. This could include acc ess to other mental health services, if sought. 13. When all people randomized in an RCT ar e kept in the trial data set and analysed according to the group to which they were randomized (Shepperd et al, 1997). 228 children in the depress ed control group was not as different from w hat might be expected as was the proportion of 'secure' children in the depressed intervention group. This is important, because it indicate s that, while the over all comparis on of the two depressed groups showed them to be 'equivalent' across the four attachment styles, the depressed control group, in fact, offered less potential for improvement than did t he intervention group. 15. All the t-test values reported in the paper are negative, which suggests reduction in knowledge pre- and post-intervention. However, the m ean values reported indicate an increase in knowledge, so we have assumed that t he negative value ts are the result of a typographical error. 16. All the t-test values reported in the paper are negative, which sugg ests reduction in life skills pre- and post-intervention. Ho wever, the mean values reported indicate an increas e in life skills, so we have assu med that the negative value ts are the result of a typographic al error. 17. Although Downs and Black do not sugges t that scores should be aggregated in this way. 229 References for included public ations for review two, question one Ackerson, B.
