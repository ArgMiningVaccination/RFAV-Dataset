Our [immune system](https://www.arisechirowellness.com/2018/11/27/immune-system-science-simplified/) distinguishes potential threats from non-threats, unhealthy cells from normal, and keeps a long list of tools that it uses to restore internal bacterial and viral balance. We have roughly 10 times more bacteria in our bodies than we have human cells! In addition, bacteria and viruses are encountered every minute of every day, so to having a proper functioning immune system is a key component to living your ideal 100 Year Lifestyle. There is a growing concern that one of the major threats to the development of healthy immune systems has been the increasing emphasis on artificial immunity through vaccines. As of 2010, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was recommending 30 vaccinations before the age of 2 years old. At the same time, rates of asthma, autism, allergies, digestive disorders, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and many other chronic conditions are also rising. Many scientists, chiropractors, medical doctors and parents have become alarmed that this massive volume and combination of inoculations is jeopardizing the long-term health of individuals and future generations. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, over $2 Billion has already been paid to parents of vaccine-injured children.(1) Japan, who has one of the highest life expectancy rates and lowest infant mortality rates, has had a voluntary vaccination policy since 1994. The US ranks 38 in life expectancy with a significantly higher infant mortality and has one of the most stringent mandatory vaccination policies in the world.(2) A vaccine works by combining four major parts: the pathogen (bacteria or virus), an amplifier, a growth material and a stabilizer. A very small amount of pathogen is not likely to cause an immune response from your body, so an amplifier called an adjuvant is added that chemically causes an immune system reaction that puts your body on the \"highest threat level.\" With this type of stimulation, the immune cells become extremely reactive to anything that seems suspicious, whether it is the vaccine, pollen, a food or even normal human cells. In addition to these adjuvants, growth materials like egg yolk, rhesus monkey embryo and, in some vaccines, aborted human fetus cells are included as the liquid medium for the pathogen.(3) As these materials are injected at the same time as the adjuvants, they may cause an immune reaction. The final ingredient in a vaccine is a stabilizer like formaldehyde, a known cancer-causing agent for which there is no safe allowable limit for your body.(4) These elements, introduced into your body through the process of a vaccination, can create hyper-stimulation, over-reactivity, and chemical toxicity. There is increasing doubt that the uncertain benefits of vaccines justify the risks.
