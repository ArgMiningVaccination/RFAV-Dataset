In the United States, aspects of traditional medicine, such as massage therapy and yoga, are a part of mainstream health and wellness culture. While many people still use traditional approaches to weight loss, others incorporate holistic practices like acupressure into their weight loss journey. In this article, we'll explore whether acupressure is beneficial for weight loss and how to incorporate acupressure into your weight loss journey. Acupressure, like acupuncture, is a type of complementary medicine that has long been a part of traditional Chinese medicine practice. While acupuncture uses needles to stimulate the various pressure points around the body, acupressure is done by stimulating these points through massage therapy. Acupressure is believed to be effective in reducing stress, boosting digestion, and improving metabolism, all of which play a role in weight management. Some pressure points are even thought to influence appetite and blood sugar levels, which makes acupressure a potential complement to traditional weight loss approaches, such as diet and exercise. The meridian energy pathway In traditional Chinese medicine, each acupressure point on the body exists on an energy pathway called a \"meridian.\" These meridians are named according to the various organs in the body. Each acupressure point along a meridian is named using the letters corresponding to that meridian, followed by the location of the point on the pathway. These acupressure points also have corresponding traditional names. Below, you will find some of the acupressure points that are believed to influence digestion, metabolism, and other factors related to weight loss. Located along the stomach meridian, zusanli is believed to influence the organs of the upper abdomen, the parasympathetic nervous system (which controls digestion), and the overall energy of the body. This point is located below the kneecap, roughly 3 inches below and 1 inch away from the center of the body. To massage this point: - Place two fingers on one of the zusanli points. - Apply gentle but firm pressure to the point with both fingers. - Use a circular motion to massage the point for 2 to 3 minutes. - Repeat on the other side. Located along the spleen meridian, sanyinjiao is thought to influence the organs of the lower abdomen and the parasympathetic nervous system. This point is located roughly 3 inches above the inner ankle bone. To massage this point: - Place one to two fingers on one of the sanyinjiao points. - Apply gentle but firm pressure to the point with the finger(s). - Use a circular motion to massage the point for 2 to 3 minutes. - Repeat on the other side. This point is along the conception vessel meridian. Zhongwan is believed to influence the organs of the upper abdomen, as well as those related to digestion, such as the stomach and intestines. This point is located roughly four inches above the navel. To massage this point: - Place two fingers on the zhongwan point. - Apply gentle but firm pressure to the point with both fingers. Be careful to not apply too much pressure to this sensitive area. - Use a circular motion to massage the point for 2 to 3 minutes. Located along the governing meridian, renzhong is thought to have an influence on weight, especially obesity. This point is located on the philtrum, less than 1 inch below where the nostrils meet. To massage this point: - Place one finger on the renzhong point. - Apply gentle but firm pressure to the point with the finger. - Use a circular motion to massage the point for 2 to 3 minutes. Located along the spleen meridian, xuehai is believed to have an impact on blood sugar levels, particularly in the context of diabetes. This point is located above the kneecap, roughly two inches away from the center of the body at the bottom portion of the thigh muscle. To massage this point: - Place two fingers on the xuehai point. - Apply gentle but firm pressure to the point with both fingers. - Use a circular motion to massage the point for 2 to 3 minutes. - Repeat on the other side. The research on acupressure and weight loss is limited. However, the current literature suggests that acupressure may be effective in aiding weight loss for individuals with obesity. In a small [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617497/) Auricular acupressure is a specific type of acupressure that stimulates the pressure points of the ear. The studies included in the analysis compared the use of acupressure alone (or with other interventions) with other experimental treatments or no treatment. The authors found that auricular acupressure was effective in reducing both overall body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) in study participants. These results remained consistent whether the acupressure was administered alone or with diet and exercise. They also found that a longer acupressure treatment period was associated with a larger impact on reducing BW and BMI. Like acupressure research, the literature on using [acupuncture](/health/acupuncture-how-does-it-work-scientifically) as a weight loss tool is limited. Still, similar results have suggested that acupuncture may be effective for aiding in weight loss. In a larger [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6022277/) The studies in this analysis compared the use of acupuncture alone with other interventions, such as medications, diet, exercise, or placebo. Researchers investigated classical acupuncture, along with other variations, such as laser acupuncture and auricular acupressure. The authors found mixed results among the studies, with some studies demonstrating more effective weight loss from acupuncture and others demonstrating no discernible difference between interventions. However, the research suggests that acupuncture may have some effect on appetite and the metabolism of hunger-related hormones. Still, further research is needed on the use of both acupressure and acupuncture as a weight loss intervention. When you're on a weight loss journey, it can be helpful to have a handful of different tools and options at your disposal, such as: - Dietary interventions. [Fad diets](/nutrition/do-diets-make-you-gain-weight)can do more harm than good. A licensed nutritionist can help you explore dietary options that will help you stay physically and mentally healthy during your weight loss journey. - Lifestyle interventions. Keeping active isn't important just for weight loss. [Exercise](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise)and other physical activities help keep both our bodies and minds strong. Consider exploring different physical activities until you find the ones you really enjoy. - Holistic interventions. [Holistic health](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/30-ways-to-lose-weight-naturally)approaches can be used in conjunction with western approaches when it comes to weight loss. While more research is still needed on the effectiveness of acupressure, it's something to consider trying. There's no one-size-fits all approach to healthy weight loss, so it can be helpful to work with a doctor or other healthcare professional to find what works for you. Acupressure is a type of traditional Chinese medicine that's believed to have many positive health benefits, including aiding in weight loss. While the research on acupressure for weight loss is scarce, the current literature suggests that both acupressure and acupuncture may be effective weight loss interventions. Before you dive into using acupressure for weight loss, reach out to a healthcare professional on how you can best incorporate this practice into your journey. "}
