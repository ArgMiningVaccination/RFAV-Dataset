These families of different cultures ascribed their health traditions to different things. The African American family states that their health traditions are passed down by elders (grandparents), of both sexes. The Mexican American family ascribes their traditions to the women of the family, stating that it is a female responsibility to pass down traditions regarding heath. The Caucasian American family states that they received their knowledge of health from what is or has been proved by science, and usually each mother of the household is responsible for the health of the family. Those barriers might compromise the quality of care if a patient and the practitioner can not communicate. In addition, race, ethnicity religion questions can give us information on an individuals cultural, ethnic and religious background, which might be useful in identifying cultural food practices and health beliefs.1,5,6. Comparing the Differences in Health Traditions 'Unity in Diversity' has been the distinctive feature of Indian culture. Whatever health traditions people follow, they are very strict on their eating habits. They eat more healthy foods and include more vegetables in the daily servings. Also for maintaining health they spend some time for exercise. For protecting health, people use various methods like rituals for self protection, superstitions, oils or water (Holy water) and specific dietary taboos that must adhered to, for example, after child birth women will have some restrictions on These religious and spiritual influences play a major role in the Hispanics health, illness and daily life. In much a similar manner, the Native American Indian family adopts the cultural beliefs to associate with illness and health. They believe that a person's state of exists when he or she exists in harmony with nature and sickness occurs when an imbalance between the natural or supernatural forces and the sick individual exists (Askim-Lovseth & Aldana, 2010). Traditional health believes and practices involving healing ceremonies and rituals restore balance when illness happens. \"These can be conducted by their traditional medicine men or women, who are thought to have compelling powers, the ability to read minds, and know-how in concocting medicine, drugs and poisons.\" For the white young family, the cultural belief of invincibility and youth are the driving force behind health prevention (Askim-Lovseth & Aldana, 2010). \"Focus on the temporary is regularised, while thinking about health is assigned to an adult person where family accountabilities pertain.\" Protecting against illness or disease does not feature into their daily lives. Disease or illness is something that is insubstantial and distant, and unimaginable to their young, resilient bodies and thus irrelevant (Edelman & Mandle, 2010). Heritage Assessment Dianna Freeman Grand Canyon University Family Centered Health Promotions NSG-429V December 20, 2014 Heritage Assessment \"Health is influenced by culture and beliefs\" (NRS-429V, 2011, p. 1). In order for the nurse to properly care for the patient, she must know and understand the patient's culture. \"Cultural care is a comprehensive model that includes the Introduction: Living in a culture that is unfamiliar to one's own can be both overwhelming and a challenging process regardless of what country you are from. The Western traditions, values, and social norms can be quite different than those from back home. Oftentimes, when individuals relocate from their homeland to a new and more developed nation, they carry their own background, life experiences, and traditions with them. For this reason, these factors shape how they perceive and adapt to their new surroundings. To be precise, individuals commonly experience what is known as \"cultural shock\", which describes the stress, disorientation, and the feelings of confusion that arise when entering a strange or foreign culture.Therefore staying committed to ancient family traditions can be difficult, which may then turn cultural transition into an ongoing battle for many. In particular, this paper will be analyzing the film, the Split Horn, through a social anthropologist's perspective and with the help of the Holistic model of health, including alternative understanding methods to further examine what certain families go through. When one of us gets sick, we try to adjust our diets to meet the best road to recovery such as increases in vitamin rich fluids and cessation of ingesting refined sugar. These techniques aid in both boosting the immune system and in starving many of the viral infections that prefer a sucrose rich environment. We also consult the internet to see what infectious agents may be making the rounds in our area and what is most effective against them. INTRODUCTION This report will be investigating the various sociological perspectives on health as well as the models and definitions of health and ill health. These topics will assist in the understanding of how different people and different cultures react to ill health. Family/Cultural Assessment Paper The Purnell Domains of Culture assessment gives a vast amount of information in regards to a persons cultural background, family and heritage that gives care provides a better understanding of their client or clients family. As a future care provider, I took the time to speak to Mrs. Smith about herself and family to gain insight on whom they are as a family and what influences them to be who they are today. Over the course of the domains of culture I have been able to increase my perception of who and what drives this family and how their beliefs came about. The cultural health beliefs are specific for the Arabs with the main concern of the family. The family's role is to indulge the sick person and take responsibilities off his or her shoulders (Salimbene et al., 2000 pg. 135). According to Meleis (2005 pg. 52), the family is central in both society and culture. When a woman is pregnant, the woman must be satisfied because \"it is believed that the unborn child may develop a birthmark in the shape of the unsatisfied craving\" (Salimbene et al., 2000). In the Arab culture, pain is harmful and should be controlled because the family does not want to see the patient Abstract In this paper I will be identifying beliefs and values common to my family of origin. I will be using Purnell's Model of cultural competency and will explain the major assumptions of the model in relevance to my culture. The purpose of this paper is to provide the reader with a quick overview of the Asian Indian culture. One must be aware of their own culture and the culture of others in order to offer competent and culturally sensitive care and understand how their cultural beliefs may affect their health. (Leuning, Swiggum, Wiegert, and McCullough-Zander, 2002). Benchmark Assignment - Heritage Assessment Benchmark Assignment - Heritage Assessment When clinically assessing patients in care settings, it is paramount for health professionals to elicit pertinent information that could be crucial for delivery of care. This is particularly important in the United States because the increasing diversity in racial and ethnic composition of the population has presented cultural challenges that care givers must navigate to provide culturally competent service. Cultural competence during delivery of care requires sensitivity to the cultural, social, and linguistic needs of patients (Betancourt, Green, Carrillo, 2002). As a consequence, care providers need cultural assessment tools that will enable them Readers of Alice Walker's, \"Everyday Use\", discusses how the narrator realizes that Maggie understands her own heritage. What does the narrator mean when she says, \"Just like when I'm in church and the spirit of God touches me and I get happy and shout?\" Does the narrator do something amazing that she has not done before? Some readers opine that the narrator knows what it really feels like to have family. Others say that the narrator recognizes the importance of giving. However, both these readings are not with the point. The narrator realizes that Maggie should have the quilts because they embody her heritage. Every culture has its own views of health care, diseases, and medical interventions. The way people of a given culture view health care affects how they handle themselves when they fall ill. For instance, the Asian culture believes that illnesses are caused by supernatural phenomena, which should be diagnosed and It's crazy to think that the way you were raised is what has made you become the person you are today. Everyone has their own story about how they were raised, where they were raised, and who they were raised with. Each person has their own type of heritage with how they are raised based upon their family, where they were raised, religion, family traditions, values, and beliefs. The way you were raised in life has influenced your personality. The way you act and the way you are viewed as are both influenced by your family's heritage. "}
