Ayurveda believes that medicines (and these could be drugs or dietary substances) are created from the specific combinations of the panchamahabhoota (five elements that form all matter on earth). These medicines help the individual to maintain his health as well as to treat disease when it occurs. Dravyagunavigyan deals with the properties, actions, uses, doses, time of administration as well as formulation of drugs. The analysis of medicines and their activities is the subject of Ayurvedic pharmacology. Ayurvedic medicines are analysed on the basis of their stable tastes, efficacy, physical properties, unstable tastes and unique powers. Analysis of Stable Tastes (Rasa Pariksha) The expected actions of a medicine can be analysed based upon taste. Taste is divided into two categories, stable and unstable. A medicine is said to have a stable taste if that taste and its related properties persist after digestion. This statement is of course a generalization, and actions can vary in the case of specific medicinal agents. SWEET TASTING MEDICNE Sweet-tasting medicines in most cases have the physical properties of greasiness and heaviness and so nourish the serum, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen. They also strengthen physical energy, increase weight and lifespan, counteract toxins and help to heal injuries. They are good for diseases where the pathogenic agents have altered the physical properties of bile (Pitta) and gas (Vata). They are bad for diseases where pathogenic agents are present and active in altering the properties of the mucus (Kapha). SWEET TASTING MEDICNE Sour-tasting medicines tend to be greasy and heating. Because of this they stimulate digestive power, increase weight and peristaltic movement, regulate heart function, and moisten the body. Sour medicines are good for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of gas (Vata) and bad for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of mucus (Kapha) and bile (Pitta). SALTY TASTING MEDICNE Salty-tasting medicines increase both fluid and heat, and so stimulate appetite, promote digestive power, moisten the body, open blockages, stimulate the glands and promote blood circulation. Salty medicines are good for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of gas (Vata) and bad for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of mucus (Kapha) and bile (Pitta). PUNGENT TASTING MEDICNE Pungent medicines are hot in nature and so stimulate the sense organs, promote appetite, and purify the blood (burn away toxins). Pungent medicines are good for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of mucus (Kapha) and bad for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of gas (Vata) and bile (Pitta). BITTER TASTING MEDICNE Bitter-tasting medicines tend to be dry and light in property, and so promote appetite and digestion, decrease weight, mucus secretions and perspiration, counteract toxins, kill worms, purify milk and strengthen the skin and muscles. Bitter medicines are good for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of mucus (Kapha) and bile (Pitta), and bad for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of gas (Vata). ASTRINGENT TASTING MEDICNE Astringent medicines tend to be dry and heavy to digest, and so promote healing of injuries, supress stool and urine, and constrict the capillaries. Astringent medicines are good for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of mucus (Kapha) and bile (Pitta), and bad for diseases where the pathogenic agents are active in the properties of gas (Vata). Analysis of Medicine Efficacy (Virya Pariksha) The efficacy or action of a medicine depends upon its dilating and constricting effects. Medicines are classified according to those which dilate generate heat, and those which constrict and cause a cooling sensation. In general, sour, salty and pungent medicines generate heat, and sweet, bitter and astringent medicines have cooling effects. An important point to grasp is that any medicine whose heating or cooling action does not follow its taste as just described will be more medicinally powerful. Medicines that are warming help counteract the pathogenic agents present in the properties of mucus (Kapha dosha) and gas (Vata dosha). Medicines that are cooling help counteract the pathogenic agents present in the properties of bile (Pitta dosha) Analysis of Physical Properties Ayurveda defines twenty physical properties. These are: 1. Heavy (Guru) and Light (Laghu) 2. Mild (Manda) and Strong (Tiksna) 3. Cold (Shita) and Hot (Ushna) 4. Greasy (Snigdha) and Dry (Ruksha) 5. Smooth (Slakshan) and Rough (Khara) 6. Solid (Sandra) and Liquid (Drava) 7. Soft (Mridu) and Hard (Kathina) 8. Stable Non-Sticky (Visada) and Sticky (Picchila) The physical properties are related to their effects on the body. Physical properties are normally related to specific tastes (sweet medicines tend to be heavy etc.), and medicines that \"follow the rules\" work in concert with the effects of the related taste. For example, to say a medicine is sweet and heavy means both that it is heavy to digest, as well as making the body heavier if ingested over time. The nutrients that normally accompany the sweet taste support this general \"heaviness\" effect on the body. In simple terms, people who eat too much sweet food will become heavy. However, if the physical properties of a medicine are different than predicted by the taste, then that medicine becomes more powerful in counteracting the physical properties of toxic gas, bile or mucus. For example, if a sweet medicine is also warming in property, it has a more powerful effect in controlling neurological (Vata) problems. Analysis of Unstable Tastes (Vipaka Pariksha) The tastes of some foods and medicines change after digestion, and this affects its action on the body, and the bowel in particular. Such changes make the medicine more powerful in effect than predicted by taste alone. Medicines that become sweet after digestion help moisten to bowel (increase mucus), clear stool and urine, and increase semen (general vital force). Medicines that become sour after digestion helps stimulate stool and urine and increases bile secretion. Medicines that become pungent after digestion dry the stool (cause constipation) and increase gas. Analysis of Unique Power (Prabhava Pariksha) Unique and powerful components of a medicine can create extraordinary effects specific to that medicine. Such effects do not follow the rules of stable or unstable tastes, heating or cooling effects or physical properties. Special properties include such things as laxatives, emetics, intoxicants, rasayanas (longevity promotion), and benefits for particular organs. Knowledge of them is the result of the experience of different Ayurvedic physicians over long periods of time. "}
