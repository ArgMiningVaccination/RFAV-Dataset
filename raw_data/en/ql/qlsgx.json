Symptoms can be mild or severe. They include decreased appetite, nausea, and fatigue. In 5 to 10% of people, hepatitis B becomes chronic and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Administration of Hepatitis B Vaccine The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given in a series of two or three injections into a muscle. However, if people who have been vaccinated are exposed to the virus, a doctor measures their antibody levels against hepatitis B. If the antibody levels are low, they may need another injection of hepatitis B vaccine. As a part of [routine childhood vaccinations](/home/children-s-health-issues/vaccination-of-children/childhood-vaccinations) [ Childhood Vaccinations Vaccination protects children against many infectious diseases.

Infants who did not receive a dose at birth should begin the series as soon as possible. (See [CDC: Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule by Age](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html)). A vaccine that combines hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is also available. This vaccine is given as a series of three or four doses in people 18 years of age and older. The hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all people up to age 59 who were not previously vaccinated. The vaccine is also recommended for all unvaccinated adults 60 years of age and older who have risk factors for hepatitis B, including the following: People who work in professions where they may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids, such as health care, custodial, or public safety workers People who travel to areas where the infection is common People with a chronic liver disorder (such as hepatitis C, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis) or high levels of certain liver enzymes in their blood People who inject illicit drugs People who have had more than one sex partner within the past 6 months People who need to be evaluated or treated for a [sexually transmitted infection](/home/infections/sexually-transmitted-diseases-stds/overview-of-sexually-transmitted-diseases-stds) [Overview of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) Sexually transmitted infection (STI) refers to an infection that is passed through blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or other body fluids during oral, anal, or genital sex with an infected partner... read more](/home/infections/sexually-transmitted-diseases-stds/overview-of-sexually-transmitted-diseases-stds) Men who have sex with men Sex partners and household contacts of people known to be carriers of hepatitis B People who have [diabetes](/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/diabetes-mellitus-dm-and-disorders-of-blood-sugar-metabolism/diabetes-mellitus-dm) [Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high.

If people have a temporary illness, doctors usually wait to give the vaccine until the illness resolves (see also [CDC: Who Should NOT Get Vaccinated With These Vaccines?](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html#tdap)). Side Effects of Hepatitis B Vaccine Occasionally, the injection site becomes sore, and a mild fever develops. People with a history of severe allergic reaction to baker's yeast, which is used in the production of the hepatitis B vaccine, should not be given the vaccine.
