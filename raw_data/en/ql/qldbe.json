The burning question is what can we do to keep ourselves healthy? With the flu and cold season tapping at our doors, it is important now more than ever to be better prepared for dealing with illnesses. Wondering how you can help your body fight off illnesses? Here's an introduction to the warrior that protects us all against pathogens that make our body more susceptible to illness - our immune system. The immune system is one of the 11 systems that act as a natural defense to help you fight harmful pathogens or disease-causing organisms. Several dietary and lifestyle changes may strengthen your body's natural defenses. But before that, it is imperative to know the signs of weakening immunity, especially during times like these. - Frequent colds and other respiratory infections: Colds are just an occasional nuisance for many, but some seem to suffer more frequently. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the average adult gets 2-3 colds a year; however, some get the flu more often than others. Now, why is that? It is because your immunity is compromised. In addition to common colds, recurrent pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinus infections are also common with weak immunity. The current pandemic is particularly dangerous for individuals with weaker immune systems. Older people and people with co-morbidities such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease appear to be more vulnerable. - Irregular digestion: According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, nearly 70% of your immune system is located in your digestive tract. The microorganisms that live there defend your gut from infections. When immunity is low, it can leave you at risk for viruses and even autoimmune disorders. - Slow healing of wounds: Moments after an injury, our skin usually begins the healing process that ultimately depends on healthy cells. The healthier the cells, the faster the damage control or healing. But in case of a weak immune system, our skin cannot regenerate itself quickly, making it hard to heal. - Stress: According to the American Psychological Association, long-term stress weakens the responses of your immune system. Stress decreases the number of the body's lymphocytes (white blood cells) that help fight off infections and illnesses. (Add Immunity test link here) Tips to boost immunity naturally: - Get enough sleep: A study was conducted with 164 healthy adults by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This study shows that those who slept for less than 6 hours each night were more likely to catch a cold than those who slept for 6 hours or more each night. It is imperative that you get adequate rest to strengthen your natural immune health. - Exercise regularly or engage in meditation: Studies by the National Center for Biotechnology Information indicate that even a single session of moderate exercise can boost the effectiveness of vaccines in people with a compromised immune system. Regular moderate exercises may also reduce inflammation and help your immune cells regenerate. - Eat a balanced diet: Eat an array of vegetables and fruits to ensure the intake of a variety of nutrients. Lean proteins and complex carbohydrates, like brown rice, are also recommended. Stay away from processed foods, sugar, and beverages. - Wash your hands and sanitize: This is a no-brainer especially with a global pandemic lurking around. - Avoid smoking or drinking: It is a big 'NO' for the overall well-being as it negatively impacts immunity. It slowly kills the natural effectiveness of the immune system, making us more susceptible to illnesses. - Homeopathic treatment:Homeopathy is a natural and safe way to build immunity. It takes into account the various underlying causes of low immunity such as allergies, asthma, thyroid problems, and so on. Homeopathic medicine is safe for all age groups as it has no side-effects or toxicity. Homeopathic medicine for immunity does not just suppress the symptoms but treats the root cause of the problem, ensuring long-term relief. The most commonly used homeopathic medicines to build immunity are: - Echinacea mother tincture - Nux Vomica - Silicea - Arsenicum Album 30 It is advised to refrain from self-medication and consult a homeopathy doctor. According to a study published on Research Gate, the effect of Arsenic Album on Leukocytes (white blood cells) was monitored closely. These cells provide protection against microbes and infectious diseases. After the treatment with homeopathic medicine Arsenic Album-30, the cell viability enhanced with increased immunity from 85% to 194%. Also, a trial run was conducted of Arsenic Album on 30,000 individuals and it showed a 100% success rate.
