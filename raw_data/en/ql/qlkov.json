I am passionate about finding ways to improve the ability of these children to eat on their own and to wean from IV nutrition.\" - Patrick Javid, MD, is an attending surgeon in the Division of Pediatric General and Thoracic Surgery at Seattle Children's Hospital, and an assistant professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine. He also attends at Seattle Children's Tri-Cities Clinic. Javid's primary focus, both clinically and in the lab, concerns intestinal failure, and the translational research needed to determine the optimal treatment options for children suffering from this condition. Dr. Javid received his MD from the University of Michigan Medical School. He completed his residency at Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School, and his fellowship at Children's Hospital at Boston Children's Hospital. - Related Resources - - - - Dr.Javid has been such a great doctor he has done three surgerys on my daughter and I felt like he was very caring and passionate about his job.
