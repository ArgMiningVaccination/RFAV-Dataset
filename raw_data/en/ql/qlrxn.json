We provide compassionate care in more than 75 communities throughout California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington. Adventist Health entities include: 20 hospitals with more than 2,700 beds More than 260 clinics (hospital-based, rural health and physician clinics) 15 home care agencies and seven hospice agencies Four joint-venture retirement centers Workforce of 32,900 includes more than 23,600 employees; 5,000 medical staff physicians; and 4,350 volunteers We owe much of our heritage and organizational success to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which has long been a promoter of prevention and whole person care. Inspired by our belief in the loving and healing power of Jesus Christ, we aim to bring physical, mental and spiritual health and healing to our neighbors of all faiths. Every individual, regardless of his/her personal beliefs, is welcome in our facilities. We are also eager to partner with members of other faiths to enhance the health of the communities we serve. Our commitment to quality health care stems from our heritage, which dates back to 1866 when the first Seventh-day Adventist health care facility opened in Battle Creek, Michigan. There, dedicated pioneers promoted the \"radical\" concepts of proper nutrition, exercise and sanitat ion. Early on, the facility was devoted to prevention as well as healing. They called it a sanitarium, a place where patients \u2014and their families \u2014could learn to be well. More than a century later, the health care system sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church circles the globe with more than 170 hospitals and more than 500 clinics, nursing homes and dispensaries worldwide. And the same vision to treat the whole person \u2014mind, body and spirit \u2014continues to provide the foundation for our progressive approach to health care. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 4 Letter from the CEO Dear Friends and Colleagues, There's nothing quite like being part of a community. For more than 100 years, San Joaquin Community Hospital\u2014 soon to be known as Adventist Health Bakersfield \u2014has been an integral part of Bakersfield and Kern County. That was the vision of Margaret Quinn and Mary O'Donnell from the beginning. Seeing a need for additional health care options in a community that was booming with oil and agricultural growth, Quinn and O'Donnell\u2014who were working at another local hospital at the time \u2014decided to pool their own money to build a new hospital in downtown Bakersfield. With the help of a few generous and prominent business leaders, the young ladies gathered enough seed money to turn the dream into reality. In 1910, a 26-bed facility they named San Joaquin Hospital opened on the corner of 27th and Eye streets. The entrepreneurial spirit that SJCH was built on has continued to drive every aspect of our organization. We've achieved a number of community \"firsts\" that have propelled health care forward in Kern County. You may not know that SJCH was the first local hospital to perform open-heart surgery in 1972. More recently, we became the first hospital between Los Angeles and San Francisco to have both a nationally accredited chest pain center and a nationally certified stroke center under one roof. These advances in health care are especially important in Kern County where access to health care, chronic disease and poor environmental and lifestyle indicators, make our community one of the unhealthiest places in California. At SJCH, our credo is to focus on solutions. That's why we've met the challenges stated above with a number of programs and initiatives. One of our most signifi cant efforts began in 1996 when we launched our Children's Mobile Immunization Program. With support from First 5 Kern, we have provided more than 198,000 free immunizations to Kern County children. In this report, you'll learn more about the health issues facing our community. But more importantly, you'll gain an appreciation for what SJCH is doing to help ensure our community members live longer, healthier lives.

We recognize that health status is a product of multiple factors. To comprehensively address the needs of our community, we must take into account health behaviors and risks, the physical environment, the health system, and social determinant of health. Each component influences the next and through strategic and collective action improved health can be achieved. The Community Health Plan marks the second phase in a collaborative effort to systematically investigate and identify our community's most pressing needs. After a thorough review of health status in our community through the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), we identified areas that we could address through the use of our resources, expertise, and community partners. Through these actions and relationships, we aim to empower our community and fulfill our mission, \"to share God's love b y providing physical, mental and spiritual healing.\" Identified Community Needs The results of the CHNA guided the creation of this document and aided us in how we could best provide for our community and the most vulnerable among us. As a result, San Joaquin Community Hospital has adopted the following priority areas for our community health investments for 2017-2019: Access to Health Care Cancer Additionally, we engage in a process of continuous quality improvement, whereby we ask the following questions for each priority area: Are our interventions making a difference in improving health outcomes? Are we providing the appropriate resources in the appropriate locations? What changes or collaborations within our system need to be made? How are we using technology to track our health improvements and provide relevant feedback at the local level? Do we have the resources as a region to elevate the population's health status? Building a healthy community requires multiple stakeholders working together with a common purpose. We invite you to explore how we intend to address health challenges in our community and partner to achieve change. More importantly though, we hope you imagine a healthier region and work with us to find solutions across a broad range of sectors to create communities we all want for ourselves and our families. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 8 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Community Profile How our community is defined The service area for San Joaquin Community Hospital includes 23 zip codes in Kern County and two zip codes in Tulare County. The Kern County zip codes included in the hospital service area, account for 88% of the population of Kern County. Ten zip codes (Bakersfield and Wasco) represent San Joaquin Hospital's \"Core Market,\" defined by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) as areas in which 70% of hospital inpatients reside.

The population density for this area, estimated at 544.85 persons per square mile, is greater than the county and state. Population of the Service Area Total Population Total Land Area (Square Miles) Population Density (Per Square Mile) SJCH Service Area 762,236 DP05. http://factfinder.census.gov . Source geography: Tract. Accessed from Community Commons. http://www.communitycommons.org/ . The area served by the hospital has experienced dramatic growth of 29.1% in the past 10 years, similar to the county average (28.2%) and higher than the state average (11.2%). Growth rates indicate Arvin, Delano, Tehachapi, and Pixley grew at higher rates than the county average. The population in Bakersfield grew by 30% on average. Children and youth, ages 0-17 make up 30.9% of the population in the service area, higher than the state rate (24.5%). The service area has 60.5% adults (ages 18-44), and 8.5% seniors. When the population is examined by place, the Arvin, Earlimart, Lamont, McFarland, and Pixley areas have the highest concentrations of children and youth in the service area; these areas also have the lowest median ages in the service area. In contrast, Lake Isabella and Wofford Heights have much higher percentages of seniors than the county or state average, with median ages of 51.1 and 56.8, respectively. Overall, the median age for Kern County (30.8) is lower than that for California (35.4). The median age for Bakersfield zip codes ranges from 26.1 to 37.9. Of the service area population, 51.5% are male and 48.5% are female, similar to the Kern County ratio. The service area consists of a higher percentage of males than the state. The service area is primarily Hispanic or Latino, at 53.9%, followed by White at 34.1%. Asians are 4.3% and Black/African Americans represent 5.1% of the population. The area has a larger percentage of Latinos than Kern County or California. In the hospital service area, 54% of residents speak English only. Spanish is spoken in 41.2% of homes, slightly higher than in Kern County (37.4%) or California (28.8%). Other languages are spoken in 4.8% of households. The County Health Rankings rank counties according to health factors data. Social and economic indicators are examined as a contributor to the health of a county's residents. California's 57 evaluated counties (Alpine excluded) are ranked according to social and economic factors with 1 being the county with the best factors to 57 for that county with the poorest factors. This ranking examines: unemployment, high school graduation COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 10 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope rates, children in poverty, social support, and others. Kern County is ranked 51, in the bottom 20% of all California counties on social and economic factors. When vulnerable populations in the area are mapped, a picture of poverty emerges. The map below shows the San Joaquin Community Hospital surrounding areas, highlighting the percentage of each subarea that has more than 20% poverty and more than 20% with low education, defined as less than a high school education (in brown). Areas above the vulnerable threshold for low education alone are displayed in lavender. Areas above the threshold for poverty alone are in tan. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 11 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Priority Areas Identified The following areas emerged from the CHNA process as the priority areas for San Joaquin Community Hospital's service area: Overweight and obesity Mental health Access to care Diabetes Cardiovascular disease Substance abuse Asthma Maternal and infant health Cancer HIV/AIDS/STD Oral health Environmental health Information gaps Information gaps that impact the ability to assess health needs were identified. Some of the secondary data are not always collected on a regular basis, meaning that some data are several years old. Disaggregated data around age, ethnicity, race, and gender are not available for all data indicators, which limited the ability to examine disparities of health issues within the community. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 12 Together Inspired Community Health Needs Assessment Overview Link to final CHNA report The 2016 CHNA was approved by the San Joaquin Community Hospital Governing Board in November of 2016. It can be located on the hospital's website at: https://www.adventisthealth.org/Documents/Community%20Benefits/CHNA%202016- 2018/Final_2016_CHNA_SJCH.pdf Methodology for CHNA Secondary data were collected from a variety of local, county, and state sources to present community demographics; social, economic and environmental factors; health access; maternal and infant health; leading causes of death; chronic disease; health behaviors; sexually transmitted infections; and mental health and substance abuse. Sources of data include Healthy Kern, Kern County Network for Children, U.S. Census American Community Survey, County Health Rankings, California Health Interview Survey, California Department of Public Health; California Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development; California Department of Justice, California Employment Development Department, Community Commons, California Cancer Registry, California Department of Education, and others. When pertinent, these data sets are presented in the context of California State, framing the scope of an issue as it relates to the broader community. The secondary data for the hospital service area were collected and documented in data tables with narrative explanation. The tables present the data indicator, the geographic area represented, the data measurement (e.g. rate, number, or percent), county and state comparisons (when available), the data source, data year and an electronic link to the data source. Analysis of secondary data included an examination and reporting of health disparities for some health indicators. The report includes benchmark comparison data that compare SJCH data findings with Healthy People 2020 objectives. Healthy People 2020 objectives are a national initiative to improve the public's health by providing measurable objectives and goals that are applicable at national, state, and local levels Primary Data Collection The analysis of secondary data yielded a preliminary list of significant health needs, which then informed primary data collection. The primary data collection process was designed to validate secondary data findings, identify additional community issues, solicit information on disparities among subpopulations, ascertain community assets to address needs and discover gaps in resources. For this Community Health Needs Assessment, information was obtained through a community survey and interviews with key community stakeholders, public health, and service providers, members of medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations in the community, and individuals or organizations serving or representing the interests of such populations. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 13 Together Inspired Interviews Targeted interviews were used to gather information and opinions from persons who represent the community served by the hospital. Given shared service areas, SJCH partnered with the Kern County Community Benefit Collaborative hospitals to conduct the interviews. Thirty-three (33) interviews were completed during September through November, 2015. The Kern County Community Benefit Collaborative developed a list of key influencers who have knowledge of community health needs. They were selected to cover a wide range of communities within Kern County, represent different age groups, and racial/ethnic populations. The identified stakeholders were invited by email to participate in a phone interview. Appointments for the interviews were made on dates and times convenient to the stakeholders. At the beginning of each interview, the purpose of the interview in the context of the assessment was explained, the stakeholders were assured their responses would remain confidential, and consent to proceed was given. Interview participants were asked to share their perspectives on a number of topics related to the identified preliminary health needs in the service area. Questions focused on the following topics: Major health issues facing the community. Socioeconomic, behavioral, environmental or clinical factors that contribute to poor health in a community. Issues, challenges, barriers faced by community members as they relate to the identified health needs (preliminary list from secondary data analysis). Services, programs, community efforts, resources available to address the health needs. Special populations or groups that are affected by a health need. Health and social services missing or difficult to access in the community. Other comments or concerns. Community Survey The Kern County Community Benefit Collaborative hospital representatives developed a plan for distribution of a survey to engage community residents. The survey was available in an electronic format through a Survey Monkey link, and in a paper copy format in English and Spanish. The hospitals distributed the surveys to their clients, in hospital waiting rooms and service sites, and through social media, including posting the survey link on hospital Facebook pages. The survey was also distributed to community partners who made them available to their clients. A written introduction to the survey questions explained the purpose of the survey and assured participants the survey was voluntary, and that they would remain anonymous. For community members who were illiterate, an agency staff member read the survey introduction and questions to the client in his/her preferred language and marked his/her responses on the survey. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 14 Together Inspired The survey asked for the respondents' zip code, age, insurance status, and perceived health status. Survey questions focused on the following topics: Biggest health issues in the community. Where residents and their families receive routine health care services. Problems faced accessing health care, mental health care, dental care or supportive services. What would make it easier to obtain care? Types of support or services needed in the community. Healthy changes adopted in the past year to improve health. Interview and survey participants were asked to provide additional comments to share with the hospitals. Analysis of the primary data occurred through a process that compared and combined responses to identify themes. All responses to each question were examined together and concepts and themes were then summarized to reflect the respondents' experiences and opinions. The res ults of the primary data collection were reviewed in conjunction with the secondary data. Primary data findings were used to corroborate the secondary data-defined health needs, serving as a confirming data source. The responses are included in the following Community Health Needs Assessment chapters. Review of Primary and Secondary Data The analysis of secondary data yielded a preliminary list of significant health needs, which then informed primary data collection. The primary data collection process helped to validate secondary data findings, identify additional community issues, solicit information on disparities among subpopulations, and ascertain community assets to address needs. The following criteria were used to identify significant health needs: The size of the problem (relative portion of population afflicted by the problem) The seriousness of the problem (impact at individual, family, and community levels) To determine size and seriousness of the problem, health indicators identified in the secondary data were measured against benchmark data, specifically California rates and Healthy People 2020 objectives, where available. Health indicators that performed poorly against one or more of these benchmarks were considered to have met the size or seriousness criteria. Additionally, primary data sources (interview and survey participants) were asked to identify and validate community and health issues; information gathered from these sources helped determine significant health needs. The following significant health needs were determined: Access to care AsthmaCOMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 15 Together Inspired Cancer Cardiovascular disease Dental health Diabetes Environmental health (air quality and water safety) Lung disease Maternal and infant health Mental health Overweight and obesity Sexually Transmitted Infections Substance abuse (alcohol, drug, tobacco use) The Kern County Community Benefit Collaborative hosted a community forum on January 19, 2016 in Bakersfield to prioritize the identified health needs. The forum engaged 38 community leaders in public health, government agencies, schools, and nonprofit organizations that serve the medically underserved, low- income, and minority populations in the community. These individuals have current data or other information relevant to the health needs of the community served by the hospital facilities. A review of the significant health needs was presented at the community forum. Priority Setting Process The forum attendees were engaged in a process to prioritize the health needs using the Relative Worth method. The Relative Worth method is a ranking strategy where each participant received a fixed number of points; in this case 100 points (5 dots equaled 100 points, where each dot was worth 20 points). Instructions were given, and the criteria for assigning points were explained. The points were assigned to health needs based on the size of the problem (relative portion of population afflicted by the problem); or seriousness of the problem (impact at individual, family, and community levels) . The points could be distributed among the health needs in a number of ways: Give all points to a single, very important item Distribute points evenly among all items (if none is larger or more serious than another) Distribute some points to some items, no points to other items In the tabulation, the health needs were ranked in priority order according to the total points the group assigned. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 16 Together Inspired Participants engaged in a group discussion about the priority areas. Participants were asked to discuss the following questions for the high priority areas: For priority issues, what is going well? What works in the community to address this issue? What groups/organizations are already focused on this issue? What/who is missing? Where are the gaps? What are the barriers? What is the level of community readiness to effectively implement and support programs to address this priority need? The information gathered from the community forums will be used for decision making in creation of the Implementation Strategy.

Where disease does exist, we will work with partners to provide affordable, high quality care to those in need. Short-term Objective Objective 1: Provide free childhood immunizations to uninsured or underinsured children throughout Kern County. Children's Mobile Immunization Program: By utilizing a speciall y-equipped recreational vehicle, the immunizations team provides free immunizations to uninsured children throughout Kern County. The clinics are publicized through the hospital's website and multiple media outlets. Since the program was established, more than 100,000 free immunizations have been provided to the children of Kern County. The SJCH Children's Mobile Immunization program is working to save lives, as well as saving our community more than $5 million annually according to a recently released report prepared by the Applied Research Center at California State University, Bakersfield. Several cost-benefit studies have been completed on immunization programs for vaccine-preventable diseases. The conclusion of a majority of the studies is that vaccines are considered the most cost-beneficial of health intervention strategies. To determine the savings to our community, the Applied Research Center took the cost of the program and added in the cost of hospitalization, medications and physicians' services to care for a child who contracts a preventable disease. It also took into consideration the cost if that child then passes it on to other family members or possibly even starts a community epidemic. Immunizations are one of the most important public health interventions in the United States. By immunizing children at an early age, the SJCH Children's Mobile Immunization Program continues to prevent many dreaded diseases and decreases the occurrence of many childhood vaccine-preventable diseases. The scope of service for the program includes the following major objectives: oPrenatal ca re- hemoglobin testing for pre/postnatal mothers oImmunizations clinics held annually oNumber of children receiving immunizations oChildren receiving health screenings (hemoglobin testing)COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 18 Together Inspired Objective 2: Educate our community on ways prevent chronic disease and the risk factors leading to them. Community lecture series: The hospital will provide a monthly community lecture series, with free admittance to the community at-large. Presenters, which will include physicians and service lin e leaders, will focus on chronic disease prevention, warning signs and management. A past example includes a free seminar conducted by aligned physician Amira Ayad, which focused on maintaining a healthy weight. These topics are planned for 2017: oThe link between diabetes and heart disease oNon-surgical weight management oValley Fever oStroke awareness oArthritis oBreast Cancer myths oAnd more... Objective 3: Reduce unnecessary ER/hospital visits by providing free flu shots to adults at the beginning of each flu season. Drive-Thru Flu Clinic: In October of 2017, the hospital will host a free drive thru flu clinic with vaccines available on a first come, first serve basis. Attendees will simply drive through a designated route and receive a free flu shot without having to leave their car. Intermediate Objective Objective 1: Provide access to health care services for vulnerable and social economically challenged populations, including basic health screenings, dental services, nutritional counseling and diabetes education. Amen Health Clinic: Over the past two years, the hospital has formed a relationship with Hillcrest Seventh-day Adventist Church to conduct a free health clinic in late January. Thus far, the partnership has included providing all medical supplies and encouraging staff members to volunteer. Plans to grow the hospital's involvement with the clinic\u2014 and partner with other like-minded organizations \u2014 are on the horizon. For the past two year, over 1,000 community members have received free health care services. Long-term Objective Objective 1: Reduce frequency and rate of Chronic Diseases: Create meaningful partnerships with businesses, churches and non-profit organizations in Kern County to address the downstream issues that lead to chronic disease, including: cultural preferences, language barriers, education gaps and the difficultly of navigating the health care continuum.

Sexually Transmitted Infections - Not applicable for a hospital to address; being addressed by other community organizations. Substance abuse - Not applicable for a hospital to address; being addressed by other community organizations.COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 24 Together Inspired Making a difference: Evaluation of 2014-2016 CHP In 2013, SJCH conducted their previous Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Significant health needs were identified from issues supported by primary and secondary data sources gathered for the Community Health Needs Assessment. In developing the hospital's Implementation Strategy associated with the 2013 CHNA, SJCH chose to address access to health care, chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, a nd cancer), and childhood immunizations through a commitment of community benefit programs and resources. To accomplish the Implementation Strategy, goals were established that indicated the expected changes in the health needs as a result of community programs and activities. Strategies to address the priority health needs were identified and impact measures tracked. The following section outlines the impact made on the selected significant health needs since the completion of the 2013 CHNA. Children's Mobile Immunization Program The SJCH Children's Mobile Immunization Program began in 1996 as a hospital-based effort to immunize Kern County children. The program expanded exponentially in 2000 when SJCH received a Proposition 10 Grant from First 5 Kern (Kern County Children and Families Commission/KCCFC). With the help of this grant, the SJCH Children's Mobile Immunization Program provides free services through a mobile unit that includes immunizations, information and education, and referral and linkage services. Through the grant a mobile unit was purchased to provide enhanced access to immunizations for families and children in the Greater Bakersfield area as well as outlying areas, including Taft, Arvin, Lamont, McFarland, Delano, Shafter, and Wasco. As part of the latest grant funding, a new mobile unit was completed in 2011 that allows the SJCH Immunization Team to reach out to additional rural communities such as Lost Hills, Maricopa and Buttonwillow in a more safe and secure unit. The hospital's i mmunization program coordinator is a member of the Immunization Coalition of the Kern County Department of Public Health. Other agencies represented on the coalition, in addition to the Kern County Department of Public Health, include: Clinica Sierra Vista, Blue Cross, Dignity Health, Lamont School District, Kern Family Health Care, Merck, Center for Disease Control, Jamison Center, Kaiser Permanente, Kern County Economic Development Corporation, WIC and Headstart Programs, and National Health Services. In 2013, the Center for Disease Control issued new guidance for the use of 317 vaccines. SJCH further prioritized hosting clinics is areas with high populations of uninsured or under-insured children. The vaccines are currently provided at no cost to children who meet one of these criteria: No health insurance Under-insured Eligible for Medi-Cal and the Child Health and Disability Program American Indian or Native Alaskan Program Goal: Increase immunization rates and reduce preventable infectious diseases for uninsured/underinsured children ages 0 - 18 with a focus on those children under 5 years of age. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 25 Together Inspired Objective: Continue free immunization clinics for children who would not be able to afford vaccines through traditional means. Impact: The SJCH Children's Mobile Immunization program is working to save lives, as well as saving the community more than $5 million annually according to a recently released report prepared by the Applied Research Center at California State University, Bakersfield. Several cost-benefit studies have been completed on immunization programs for vaccine-preventable diseases. The conclusion of a majority of the studies is that vaccines are considered the most cost-beneficial of health intervention strategies. To determine the savings to our community, the Applied Research Center took the cost of the program and added in the cost of hospitalization, medications and physicians' services to care for a child who contracts a preventable disease. It also took into consideration the cost if the child then passes it on to other family members or possibly even starts a community epidemic. Immunizations are one of the most important public health interventions in the United States. By immunizing children at an earl y age, the SJCH Children's Mobile Immunization Program continues to prevent diseases and decrease the occurrence of childhood vaccine- preventable diseases. Data from the 2014-2015 California Department of Public Health Immunization Report show Kern County and Tulare County schools have high rates of compliance with childhood immunizations upon entry into kindergarten. Kern County (93.5%) and Tulare County (96.5%) have childhood immunization rates above the state average (90.4%). 2014 The mobile vehicle hosted 198 clinics in Bakersfield and rural Kern County communities. Through these efforts, 14,490 vaccines were administered to 4,702 children. 2015 The mobile vehicle hosted 171 clinics in Bakersfield and rural Kern County communities. Through these efforts, 12,066 vaccines were administered to 3,702 children. 2016 The mobile vehicle hosted 156 clinics in Bakersfield and rural Kern County communities. Through these efforts, 9,033 vaccines were administered to 3,088 children. Chronic Disease: Heart Disease, Stroke and Cancer In 2009, SJCH became a Nationally Accredited Chest Pain Center by the Society of Chest Pain Centers. In 2011, the Chest Pain Center received the American College of Cardiology Foundation's National Cardiovascular Data Registry ACTION Registry Get With the Guidelines Silver Performance Achievement. In 2012, the Chest Pain Center once again earned full accreditation with PCI from the Society of Cardiovascular Patient Care (formally, the Society of Chest Pain Centers). As an accredited chest pain center, SJCH is viewed as a key provider to educate the residents of Bakersfield and Kern County on the importance of recognizing the symptoms of a heart attack, as well as preventing cardiac COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 26 Together Inspired disease by eliminating key lifestyle risk factors. The Chest Pain Center team has worked diligently to increase education in Kern County. Current efforts include: Working with local EMS and hospitals as part of a Stemi System of Care Taskforce. This taskforce is focused on improving transfer agreements with all Kern County hospitals and implementing in-field ECGs to help diagnose patients before they get to the hospital. Providing community education events, including health screenings and public CPR trainings. Participating in the Early Heart Attack Education (EHAC) program, with an emphasis on educating SJCH employees to recognize the early symptoms of a heart attack. Mos t recently, th e hospital's Chest Pain Center was recognized as a Mission Lifelin e Heart Attac k Receiving. The award is th e highes t designation given for consistency in treating STEMI (S T segmen t elevation myocardial infarction ) incid ents, a severe form o f acute heart attack. In addition, the hospital has also received the Mission Lifelin e Gold Plus Award for stroke care. SJCH is working with EMS and other local partn ers to develop a local taskforc e focused on stroke care, similar to the Stemi System of Car e Taskforce describ ed prev iously. Program Goal: Decrease chronic disea se rate s within our community. Objective: Improv e health and quality of life through community-based prevention, detection, and treatment of risk factors for h eart disease , stroke and cancer. Impact: The AIS Cancer Center Look Good Feel Better classes: Monthly, the AIS Cancer Center partners with the American Cancer Society to provide free instruction for cancer patients coping with appearance-related side effects during cancer treatment. A complimentary make-up kit is provided to all patrons. What's Your Plan Community Lectur e Series: SJCH hosts regular educatio n seminars. Sem inar topics range from weigh t managem ent to new advances in canc er screenings. Suppo rt groups: Monthly suppo rt groups focus on helping cancer patien ts and burn surviv ors cope with their treatment and/or recovery process ar e led by licens ed professionals.

These tools have led to early diagnosed illnesses in several cases. Community outrea ch: Throughou t the year, clinical experts in high-priority areas (stroke, h eart disease, cancer, etc.) ar e deployed to the community. Thes e initiatives includ e participating in doz ens of community heal th fairs, speaking at local businesses and participating in non-profit health-focused events. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 27 Together Inspired 2014 The hospital hosted a lecture on weight management that was attended by nearly 50 people. In addition, throughout the year, the hospital participated in dozens of health outreach events throughout Bakersfield and the rural areas of Kern County. The hospital held a community wide health fair at its Annual GospelFest event, d rawing more than 4,000 people. The health fair focused on showcasing fun ways to learn how to prevent and recognize heart disease, stroke and cancer. In addition, a variety of free screenings, such as blood pressure and body mass index, were provided to attendees. 2015 The hospital conducted the following community lectures available at no cost to the community at large. Over 1,000 participated in the health education offerings.

The prostate cancer screening reached 51 men and 17 abnormal results (33%) were identified. The skin cancer screening reached 107 people and 15 abnormal results (14%) were identified. When abnormal results occurred, the cancer center team then worked with the individuals to determine next steps and provided support and resources for further treatment. 2016 In 2016, the hospital continued to provide community education through the monthly lecture series - topics included many of the same areas from 2015, with new information added. In all, over 1,000 people attended Community Lecture Events in 2016 at the hospital. Through The AIS Cancer Center, two screenings were also held: breast cancer and prostate cancer. 110 patients were screened with 30 abnormalities found. These individuals were referred for further treatment. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 28 Together Inspired Access to Health Care Access to comprehensiv e, quality health care is important for the achie vement of health equity and for increasing the quality of lif e for everyone. Acce ss means many things to commun ities but mo st often revolves around the topics of availability, cost and levels of coverag e for health care. Employment, poverty, education, transportation , cultural identity , communication and languag e barriers, age , mental health , and a hos t of social indicato rs em erge within the topic of health care access. Program Goal: Provid e acc ess to heal th car e for the uninsured and underinsured. Objective: Increas e access to and use of prev entiv e medical care to the community at-large, specifically the uninsured/underinsured population. Impact: In 1997, Dav e and Kathy Voss started Jesus Sh ack as a grass-roo ts concer t production company, exclusively staffed by volunte ers. In 2003, the organization 's outreach gre w with the formation o f the Street Team 's Ministry. Each month, Jesus Shack Street Tea ms join with local churches, businesses, non-profit organizations, and city governmen t agenci es to take bi-monthly trips into impoverished neighborhood s to deliver food and offer pray er and encouragem ent. Similar to the concer t ministry, Stree t Team s are heavily relian t on local businesse s and individual volunteers to lend time and support. In the years sinc e, Jesus Sh ack h as continu ed to enhan ce its outreach to the community . In 2009, Dav e Voss approached San Joaquin Community Hospital (SJCH ) to suggest a partnership to provide free or low-co st health care servic es to Kern County's uninsured population through a mobile medical program. As a result, SJCH initiated a partnership with Jesus Sh ack through a $50,000 donation to help build the Jesus Shac k Mobile Medical un it. The vehicl e, a customiz ed mobil e hom e, is a doctor 's office on wheels that provides a secure and sanitary environment for physicals, lab tes ts and other medical procedu res. If a person requires further diagno stic tests or care, they are ref erred to a local health provid er. SJCH has partn ered with Jesus Shack on a vouch er program that provid es addition al services to individuals fo r minimal co-p ay. Whil e SJCH was the first hospital to adopt the vouch er program , other local health providers are beginning to provide free or low-cost servic es as well. In addition to SJCH's initial investmen t, the hospital agreed to donate $30,000 each year to fund computers, lab equipment and other medical supplies. Since the Mobile Medical unit requ ires medically-trained volunteers, SJCH regular ly invites Jesus Shack to display the unit at many of its hospital and community events, including: GospelFe st, Sacred Work Sabbath and Hospital Week . During these ev ents, SJCH official s make regular appeals to physicians, nu rses and other medical profession als to lend their tim e and expertis e to the Mobile Medical outreach. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 29 Together Inspired 2014 In partnership with SJCH, the Jesus Shack Mobile Medical Unit held 56 clinics and provided free or low cost health care to 575 adults throughout Bakersfield and Kern County. In addition, 425 children received physicals and vision and dental checkups. The hospital coordinated a community-wide drive-thru flu clinic to provide free flu shots to adults in need of vaccines. In addition, adults can also receive the flu shot at any of the children's immunization clinics. The hospital's drive -thru flu clinic, held on November 8, 2014, provided free flu shots to 507 adults and 147 adults received vaccines through the mobile children's clinics throughout the year. SJCH provided $8,949,452 in financial assistance charity care to qualified patients who did not have health care coverage. 2015 In 2015, the hospital's prior relationship with Jesus Shack's Mobile Medical Program ended. The hospital's drive -thru flu clinic, held on November 14, 2016, provided free flu shots to 257 adults and hundreds more continue to receive the vaccines, which are available at the regularly scheduled children's clinics while supplies last. SJCH provided $5,170,416 in financial assistance charity care to qualified patients who did not have health care coverage. 2016 The hospital's drive -thru flu clinic, held in October 2016, provided free flu shots to 343 adults and hundreds more continue to receive the vaccines, which are available at the regularly scheduled children's clinics while supplies last.

COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 30 Together Inspired Strategic Partner List San Joaquin Community Hospital supports local partners to augment our own efforts, and to promote a healthier community. Partnership is not used as a legal term, but a description of the relationships of connectivity that are necessary to collectively improve the health of our region. One of our objectives is to partner with other nonprofit and faith-based organizations that share our values and priorities to improve the health status and quality of life of the community we serve. This is an intentional effort to avoid duplication and leverage the successful work already in existence in the community.

N/A N/A COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 33 Together Inspired Connecting Strategy and Community Health As hospitals move toward population health management, community health interventions are a key element in achieving the overall goals of reducing the overall cost of health care, improving the health of the population, and improving access to affordable health services for the community both in outpatient and community settings. The key factor in improving quality and efficiency of the care hospitals provide is to include the larger community they serve as a part of their overall strategy. Health systems must now step outside of the traditional roles of hospitals to begin to address the social, economic, and environmental conditions that contribute to poor health in the communities we serve. Bold leadership is required from our administrators, healthcare providers, and governing boards to meet the pressing health challenges we face as a nation. These challenges include a paradigm shift in how hospitals and health systems are positioning themselves and their strategies for success in a new payment environment. This will impact everyone in a community and will require shared responsibility among all stakeholders. Population health is not just the overall health of a population but also includes the distribution of health. Overall health could be quite high if the majority of the population is relatively healthy \u2014even though a minority of the population is much less healthy. Ideally such differences would be eliminated or at least substantially reduced. Community health can serve as a strategic platform to improve the health outcomes of a defined group of people, concentrating on three correlated stages: 1)The distribution of specific health statuses and outcomes within a population; 2)Factors that cause the present outcomes distribution; and 3)Interventions that may modify the factors to improve health outcomes. Improving population health requires effective initiatives to: 1)Increase the prevalence of evidence-based preventive health services and preventive health behaviors, 2)Improve care quality and patient safety and 3)Advance care coordination across the health care continuum. Our mission as a health system is to share God's love by providing physical, mental and spiritual healing and we believe the best way to re-imagine our future business model with a major emphasis of community health is by working together with our community. COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN 2017 | 34 OUR MISSION: Living God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope Financial Assistance Policies At San Joaquin Community Hospital, we're committed to keeping our community healthy. As a result, the ability to pay should never stop an individual from seeking needed care. Our financial assistance program offers: If you are uninsured, you may be eligible to receive a discount for your services under our Uninsured Discount policy. If you are uninsured, our financial counselors will help you find out if you qualify for a government program such as Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). If one of these programs is right for you, they may be able to assist you with the application process. If you do not qualify for a government program, we provide discounts to eligible low-income patients and underinsured patients. Please contact our patient financial services department if you cannot pay part of your bill. We will review your financial situation to determine if you are eligible for financial assistance. If you cannot afford to pay your bill after your care is complete, we will review your situation to determine if you are eligible for assistance. For more information, patients can contact Patient Financial Services at 661-869-6800.

We have also incorporated our community benefit work to be an extension of our care continuum. Our strategic investments in our community are focused on a more planned, proactive approach to community health. The basic issue of good stewardship is making optimal use of limited charitable funds. Defaulting to charity care in our emergency rooms for the most vulnerable is not consistent with our mission. An upstream and more proactive and strategic allocation of resources enables us to help low- income populations avoid preventable pain and suffering; in turn allowing the reallocation of funds to serve an increasing number of people experiencing health disparities.

Charity Care does not include: a) bad debt or uncollectible charges that the hospital recorded as revenue but wrote-off due to failure to pay by patients, or the cost of providing care to such patients; b) the difference between the cost of care provided under Medicaid or other means-tested government programs, and the revenue derived there from; or c) contractual adjustments with any third-party payers. Clinical services are provided, despite a financial loss to the organization; measured after removing losses, and by cost associated with, Charity Care, Medicaid, and other means-tested government programs. Community Health Improvement Interventions carried out or supported and are subsidized by the health care organizations, for the express purpose of improving community health. Such services do not generate inpatient or outpatient bills, although there may be a nominal patient fee or sliding scale fee for these services. Community Health Improvement - These activities are carried out to improve community health, extend beyond patient care activities and are usually subsidized by the health care organization. Helps fund vital health improvement activities such as free and low cost health screenings, community health education, support groups, and other community health initiatives targeting identified community needs. Subsidized Health Services - Clinical and social services that meet an identified community need and are provided despite a financial loss. These services are provided because they meet an identified community need and if were not available in the area they would fall to the responsibility of government or another not-for-profit organization. Financial and In -Kind Contributions - Contributions that include donations and the cost of hours donated by staff to the community while on the organization's payroll, the indirect cost of space donated to tax-exempt companies (such as for meetings), and the financial value (generally measured at cost) of donated food, equipment, and supplies. Financial and in-kind contributions are given to community organizations committed to improving community health who are not affiliated with the health system. Community Building Activities - Community-building activities include interventions the social determinants of health such as poverty, homelessness, and environmental problems.
