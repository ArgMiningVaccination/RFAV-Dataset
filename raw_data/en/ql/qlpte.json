A Note From Dr. Bobby Price RADIATE PURE JOY AND HAPPINESS AFTER ONE HERBAL DETOX \"In the second chapter of my book, \"Vegucation Over Medication\", I explain how toxicity is the true cause of disease. The body is a self-healing mechanism when we keep it clean and nourished. This is why so many people, despite their various backgrounds and different levels of health, experience benefits from my Herbal Detox.\" - Dr. Bobby Price What are people saying about the 14 Day Herbal Detox? \"I had a wonderful group detox experience; no nausea, vomiting or ill feelings throughout the 30-days. I didn't stray from the recommended foods list; however, I only lost 12 pounds. I wanted to lose more, but I figured it was probably because I've been meatless since mid-January & also completed Dr. Bobby's 14-day detox on my own. I lost 22 pounds, then. Today, I'm down 34 pounds & I feel better than I have in years! My sciatic pain is GONE! My osteoarthritis in my left hip doesn't bother me anymore and neither does my diabetic neuropathy awake me in the middle of the night! I also have PCOS and HTN. I don't take any insulin or oral antihyperglycemic meds; I now control my blood sugars with my diet & my blood pressure meds have been decreased by half! Thank you, Dr. Bobby, for sharing your knowledge with us & for helping me on the path to regaining my health!\" -Tyrice Thomas-Leonard \"Just wanted to say thank you for sharing your knowledge it has changed my life and everyone around keeps asking me what I'm doing. I've just stuck with it since the detox. I'm 24lbs down from 187lbs when I last saw you to 163lbs when I started this journey on April 3rd. I just wanted to detox not knowing I was stepping into a total lifestyle change and loving it and feeling great. My body looks and feels amazing. I haven't had meat, dairy, can/jar foods, or processed foods since. I got your book off of Amazon too, and I'm already halfway through it. This is coming from someone who doesn't like to read books and very hard to convince about most things. I'm referring people to your left and right. Keep spreading the good knowledge!\" -Timothy Kirkland \"I am a huge foodie at heart..I've done every diet from Weight Watchers to Keto..I had tried going plant-based before but I failed making up every excuse in the world of why I must have meat and/ or dairy in my life...A friend gave me Dr.Price's book( Vegucation over Medication) about 2 months ago & It literally changed my life...Then I joined the 30 Day Detox Challenge...I feel the Detox teas are a MUST if you're new to a plant-based diet ...For me, the Detox teas made it easier for me to sustain eating plant-based...Ok ok, the teas are awfully bitter like it will make u want to cry...But as time went on, around Day 7 I noticed they weren't as bitter...My energy was through the roof! I slept better...I no longer needed coffee in the mornings...My cravings for junk food disappeared...No more acid reflux, No more fatigue, and sluggish feeling after eating meals...And I swear the teas balanced my hormones & increased my libido I lost inches & 10 lbs! And the love & support from the group & Dr. Bobby over the course of the 30 Day Detox was amazing...I didn't feel like I was doing it alone...We shared our setbacks, triumphs, wonderful recipes and more...We became a detox family ...Thank U Dr. Bobby for sharing your life's work and I appreciate your style of delivering life-changing information that's easy to understand and literally walking me step by step into a plant-based lifestyle\" - Chandra M. Cooper \"There are some looking for alternative ways of becoming and staying healthy. The constant use of prescription medicines to make you well is daunting at best. The problem is that many that want to make this change do not know where to start. This is where Dr. Bobby Price fills that void. He is knowledgeable and compassionate about his work. My wife and I wanted to change our eating lifestyle and utilize food as medicine and not a death sentence. Dr. Price has been our tour guide on this journey to a healthier alternative of using food as medicine. Try his herbal detox and you will see the difference too.\" -Trammel and Esma Fox "}
