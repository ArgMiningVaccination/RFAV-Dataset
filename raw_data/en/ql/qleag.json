From this grounded place of connection we move through an all-levels Wellness Qigong practice to breathe, stretch and flow into harmonious alignment, open our meridian channels and activate our energetic fields. Finally we will weave together into a group acupuncture mandala and receive a blissful sound healing bath of song, mantra, singing bowls and vibrational medicine. The effects of acupuncture include opening our Qi fields, allowing the vibrational medicine to resonate even more profoundly through the layers of our being. We rest deep into ourselves to find greater relaxation, release what's no longer needed and create space for the body and mind to balance and heal. By joining together in the ceremony of community we empower the potency of collective resonance and intentions, leaving us deeply connected, nourished and aligned. 15 min Opening circle 45 Min Qigong An entire hour of relaxing and receiving Acupuncture & Soundbath Sound Baths are known to promote overall health in the physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, and energetic bodies.
