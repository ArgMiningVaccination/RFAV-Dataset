At 24 hrs If methotrexate is given as continuous infusion for 24 hrs, and level GREATER than 20 micromol/L at the end of infusion 1) Adjust LV to 50 mg IV/PO Q6H. 2) Increase fluid intake to 4-6 liters per day. Recommendations BELOW apply to both continuous infusion and short infusion of high dose methotrexate If LESS than 1 micromol/L Continue the same dose as initially started. If 1 - 5 micromol/L 1) Adju st LV to 50 mg IV/PO Q6H. 2) Increase fluid intake to 4 - 6 liters per day. If 5 - 10 micromol/L 1) Adjust LV 100 mg/m2 IV Q6H (LV dosages may be reduced, as indicated, as serum methotrexate level decreases). 2) Increase fluid intake to 4 - 6 liters per day. If 10 - 20 micromol/L 1) Adjust LV to 200 mg/m2 IV Q6H (LV dosages may be reduced, as indicated, as serum methotrexate level decreases). 2) Increase fluid intake to 4 - 6 liters per day. At 48 hrs If >20 - 50 micromol/L 1) Adjust LV 500 mg/m 2 IV Q6H (LV dosage may be reduced as indicated, as serum methotrexate level decreases). 2) Increase fluid intake to 4 - 6 liters per day. At 72 hrs If methotrexate is given as continuous infusion, and level GREATER than 0.1 micromol/L but less than 1 micromol/L at 48 hrs; If methotrexate is given as a short infusion (over 0.5-6 hours), and level GREATER than 0.2 micromol/L but less than 1 micromol/L at 48 hrs; 1) Adjust LV to 50 mg IV/PO Q6H until the methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromol/L. 2) Increase fluid intake to 4 - 6 liters per day. If serum creatinine is increased by 50% from baseline on the next day f 1) Adjust LV to 100 mg/m2 IV Q6Hand continue until MTX level LESS than 0.05 micromol/L (LV dosages may be reduced, as indicated, as serum methotrexate level decreases). 2) Increase fluid intake to 4-6 liters per day. *Fluid of 2 - 3 liters per day with urinary alkalinization with 50-100 mEq/m2 per day should be given prior to methotrexate infusion to ensure urine pH is 7 or greater. Hydration should be continued for 24 to 48 hrs after the methotrexate infusion is complete. C O N T I N U E D O N N E X T P A G E ... . . Last Updated on January 17, 2007 Doses of leucovorin greater than 50 mg have to be given as intravenous form due to decreased oral bioavailability of leucovorin at dose >50 mg. Monitor for signs/symptoms of increased methotrexate toxicities: nausea/vomiting, mucositis, low urine pH, urine output, increased serum creatinine, neurotoxicity, and liver toxicities). Patients who are at high risk of methotrexate toxicity include those with pre-existing renal dysfunction, prior cisplatin therapy, \"third spacing\" (pleural effusion, ascites, etc) non-st eroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, probenecid, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim\u00ae/Septra\u00ae) should be placed on hold during methotrexate infusion and may be resumed when methotrexate level is less than 0.05 micromol/L.
