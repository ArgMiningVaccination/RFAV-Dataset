It takes a nutritionally-sound energy supplement to replenish that energy so you can keep lowering your weight. Some sources of dietary energy, like an energy drink, can be harmful to your health, especially for your blood sugar levels and heart stress. Herbal energy supplements deliver spike-free levels of natural energy to maintain normal body functions when you don't get enough energy from your diet. When you raise metabolism, it has an effect on other systems in your body. Herbal One's energy supplements also help your heart health, boost your brain and nervous system and improve your body's absorption of nutrients so it is better able to manage the energy boost, and your weight loss. Essential nutrients and fatty acids are \"essential\" because your body needs them, but your body can't produce them. When your diet changes to help you lose weight, our energy supplements ensure that your body gets all the essential nutrients and fatty acids it needs for optimal health while you lower your weight.
