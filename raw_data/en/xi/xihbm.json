Power Up Your Cells Healthy mitochondria produce the energy that powers our cells. Over time, however, mitochondria lose function. Researchers have identified several compounds that can help mitochondria work more efficiently, and even help generate new mitochondria. These compounds are combined to create Life Extension's Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer with PQQ. Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer Supplement With Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer with PQQ? Energy: it powers us. It helps us perform at our best. And at the heart of this energy is our cell's power suppliers, mitochondria. To maintain your youthful cellular energy, you've got to support and maintain your mitochondria. That's because over time, their function declines and that power won't be delivered to where it's needed as easily. Luckily, researchers have identified several nutrients including PQQ and R-lipoic acid that can help you promote youthful energy. We've combined these energy-promoting nutrients to formulate our Mitochondrial Energy Optimizer. This formula, based on science, can help you maintain the health of your mitochondria\u2014and even generate new ones. Start nourishing your mitochondria so they keep churning out youthful energy.
