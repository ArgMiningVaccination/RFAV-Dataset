He offers these essays as a means of orientation and \"explorations\" (in Paul Celan's meaning). The author emphasizes in his preface, however, that representatives of Anthroposophy nevertheless have an obligation to speak out on the subject: \"If they silence or censor themselves because they do not want to seem in any way negative as a result of their critical reflections, or because even 'before corona' they quickly became the target of various accusations, they lose nothing less than the justification for their existence, their inner identity and credibility, as well as their 'historical conscience'\u2014the crucial meaning of which Rudolf Steiner pointed to time and again and not without reason.\" This book was originally published in German as Mysterium Arlesheim, earlier English translation of the essay \"A Medicalized Society?\" (translated by Thomas O'Keefe and Charles Gunn) first appeared in Deepening Anthroposophy, no. 9.1 (that translation has been revised for this volume).
