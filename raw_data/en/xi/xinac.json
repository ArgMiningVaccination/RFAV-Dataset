If you use our links to purchase something, we may earn a commission. [Read our disclosures.](/disclosure/) We know your home gym is filled with the [best home gym equipment](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/home-gym-essentials) on the market, and you're working to get stronger, faster, and better. Nutritional supplementation could help. Pre-workout supplements are multi-ingredient products designed to [boost energy and improve exercise performance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30089501/)1. Choosing the right pre-workout can be overwhelming, so we've rounded up the 18 best pre-workouts on the market based on our in-depth, multi-point testing methodology. We specifically rate and personally test products for factors such as the following: - Formulation: Does it have scientifically-backed ingredients and dosages? - Third-party tested: Can we trust that the label is accurate? - Taste: Is it drinkable, and are there multiple flavor options? - Price per serving: Does it fall in line with the market average, or are you paying too much? - Solubility: Does it mix well with the recommended amount of liquid? On staff, we have certified personal trainers, certified nutrition coaches, USA Weightlifting coaches, and elite-level athletes who personally tested more than 50 pre-workouts. They detailed their hands-on experiences with each product, and I used my Ph.D. in exercise physiology to assess which pre-workouts contain research-backed ingredients, are effective, and are worth your money.

It only comes in two flavors; the Tiger's Blood flavor is our preferred choice. Newly released, Onnit's Alpha BRAIN Pre-Workout took us by a bit of a surprise. It has stolen our nod for Editor's Choice, because two of our product testers (USA Weightlifting coaches and certified personal trainers) found it highly beneficial before their workouts, rating it a 4 out of 5 for its positive effects. We got our hands on the only two flavors this pre-workout comes in: Yuzu Peach and Tiger's Blood. Four people on GGR Head of Content Kate Meier's weightlifting team tested Alpha BRAIN for multiple workouts. Every single person commented on their increased focus and energy going into the workout. \"I felt incredibly clear and prepared for my lifting session,\" says Jacob Penner, USAW-L2 coach and owner of Endless Strength Weightlifting. \"While I didn't get the tingles like I do with other pre-workouts, I definitely still got a pump.\" At first glance, the formulation is clearly unique. Alpha BRAIN Pre-Workout has some of the common ingredients you'll find in most of these supplements, earning an overall 4 out of 5 for its formulation. It has 200 milligrams of caffeine, but is under-dosed in both beta-alanine (2.4 grams) and l-citrulline (2.4 grams), according to clinically-backed recommended dosages. The formula is also missing betaine anhydrous, which is well-studied for its beneficial effects on muscular power and work capacity, as well as [creatine](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-creatine), the most-researched sports supplement that has proven beneficial effects on increased exercise performance and muscle mass. However, a noticeable addition is ashwagandha, an herb known for its calming effects. \"Alpha BRAIN does contain some novel ingredients like NooGandha which is a patented form of Ashwagandha, a nootropic that [recent research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8006238/) has shown to have benefits to athletic performance,\" Destini Moody, registered dietitan. RELATED: [The Best Ashwagandha Supplements](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-ashwagandha-supplement) Alpha BRAIN also contains Dynamine, which acts as an enhancement to caffeine by increasing alertness and energy levels. \"Be careful, though; Onnit warns that if you decide to take this supplement, you should not do it in combination with any other foods, drinks or supplements that contain more than 50 milligrams of caffeine,\" Destini says. As far as taste goes, be warned: None of our testers enjoyed Yuzu Peach, calling it bitter (\"I couldn't even finish mine,\" Kate says). However, Tiger's Blood got our stamp of approval, bringing a much more enjoyable blend of coconut, watermelon, and strawberry flavors. Overall, we rated this a 4 out of 5 for taste. This pre-workout is more expensive than most, ringing in at $3 a serving. However, Onnit offers Overall: Transparent Labs BULK Good for: Anyone looking for a product to support testosterone levels and to promote increased muscle growth Best Pre-Workout Overall [ Transparent Labs BULK Pre-Workout ](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/transparent-labs-bulk-pre-workout) [](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/transparent-labs-bulk-pre-workout) Product Highlights - Formulated to help support muscle gain - 20 grams of research-based active ingredients per serving - 8 flavor variations are available Pros & Cons Pros - Transparent ingredient list - No artificial sweetener or color - Moderate dose of caffeine - 8 flavor options - 60-day money-back assurance Cons - No creatine - Some users report it tastes bad Bottom Line Transparent Labs' BULK supplement is attractive to those whose primary focus is split between potential muscle gain and a pre-workout pump. While the taste is questionable, the product works well for most users. As the name would suggest, BULK pre-workout is marketed to individuals who are looking to bulk up and [ gain muscle mass](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/how-to-lift-heavier)\u2014but it should work for anyone, regardless of their fitness goals. It's got an impressive line-up of ingredients, transparent labeling, and is free from artificial preservatives, sweeteners, and gluten. Nicole Davis, GGR Editor and certified nutrition coach, tried the Blue Raspberry flavor of BULK. \"It was tasty, and it mixed well,\" she says, rating it a perfect 5-out-of-5 for both taste and solubility. \"I experienced significant tingling and only took half a serving, so there's something to be said of that mega dose of beta-alanine.\" Each serving contains 8 grams of citrulline malate, a staple in most pre-workouts these days as it can improve strength, aerobic performance, and ease temporary muscle soreness following intense exercise, [ according to a 2021 metanalysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8571142/)2. Kudos to Transparent Labs for including the research-backed dose of this ingredient. Next on the list is beta-alanine, which BULK has a whopping 4 grams per serving. Although that's the recommended dose to take in a day to support [improvements in muscular endurance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3374095/)3, it's a hefty serving to take all at once. Just be aware you may be experiencing some tingles in your face and hands due to a condition called paresthesia. Like other Transparent Labs products, BULK contains a blend of caffeine and L-Theanine\u2014a combination shown to promote [increased energy and reaction time](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18681988/)4. Add in the [L-Tyrosine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26424423/)5 and [Alpha GPC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5629791/)6 and you've got yourself a nice little cocktail to support increased mental focus. One important callout is that this pre-workout has 180 milligrams of caffeine, which is on the lower side compared to other pre-workouts. \"Despite the lower caffeine content, I feel energized without jitters, and the focus it provides is like putting horse blinders on your brain and the only thing you can see are the weights,\" says GGR performance editor and certified personal trainer Anthony O'Reilly. \"The pump is also filthier than a pig rolling in mud.\" Besides the omission of creatine, the most researched supplement known to increase [muscle strength and size](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5469049/)7, there aren't too many cons with this product. Based on reviews, the flavor appears to be less than desirable to many reviewers (but we liked it), and the 4 grams of BCAAs add nothing but \"bulk\" (no pun intended) to the product. But overall, this is a product that contains research-backed ingredients to enhance strength, stamina, focus, and energy, and could be suitable for bodybuilders or those just looking to pack on muscle. Anthony has one warning: \"The scoop is huge, bigger than most other pre-workouts.\" Want to learn more?

It may be a good choice for those who want a clean and effective product with a dose of vitamins. Xwerks Ignite is a naturally and artificially sweetened pre-workout chock full of ingredients shown to support increased performance and focus during workouts. Nicole Davis, a GGR editor and precision nutrition coach who personally tried more than a dozen pre-workouts, used Ignite a few times prior to her workouts. \"Of all the pre-workouts I tried, this one gave me the best energy boost and helped with my focus, but I did experience tingling,\" she says, giving it a perfect 5 out of 5 for its effects. What I love most about this product is its combination of nootropics to support brain function and focus. If you're What I love most about this product is its combination of nootropics to [support brain function and focus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978226/)8. If you're new to the world of nootropics, they are a group of ingredients known as \"cognitive enhancers,\" which claim to promote increased mental alertness, as well as boost energy levels. Ignite's formula contains [Rhodiola Rosea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30564123/)9, [DMAE Bitartrate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22300295/)10, [caffeine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8202818/)11, and L-Tyrosine5\u2014all scientifically backed ingredients that can aid in memory and concentration, while easing minor daily stress. Ignite also contains beta-alanine, which can enhance muscular endurance and help regulate muscular pH.3 The 1.5-gram dose is half the recommended daily dose; however, if taken regularly, you may still see a benefit. * The 150-milligram dose of caffeine may be a little low for habitual caffeine users; however, it's the perfect starting point for anyone new or sensitive to the effects of caffeine. Ignite does contain sucralose (an artificial sweetener). This isn't much of a dealbreaker for me, as I'd prefer to drink a pre-workout that doesn't taste like grass. However, if you're on the lookout for a product free from anything artificial, you'll want to steer clear of this one. \"This powder is very soluble,\" Nicole notes, giving it a perfect score on that rating, \"but I did think the Watermelon flavor was pretty artificial-tasting and too sweet for my liking.\" Natural Pre-Workout: Legion Athletics Pulse Pre-Workout Good for: People looking for a 100% nature-based pre-workout that delivers a hefty dose of caffeine Best Natural Pre-Workout [ Legion Athletics Pulse Pre-Workout ](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/legion-athletics-pulse-pre-workout) [](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/legion-athletics-pulse-pre-workout) Product Highlights - 100% nature-based - Free from added sugar, food dyes, and other chemicals - Full refund if not satisfied - Can get with or without caffeine - 15 flavors available Pros & Cons Pros - All natural ingredients - Free from dye and chemicals - Naturally sweetened - Intended to avoid the dreaded crash - Full refund if not satisfied - Can get with or without caffeine - 15 flavors available Cons - Natural sweeteners make for a different taste\u2014it may not be your cup of tea - Only 21 servings per tub Bottom Line Formulated with all-natural ingredients, each of which are present at a high level, Pulse is a fan-favorite. If you're trying to avoid artificial flavors and chemicals, this may be a good choice. Pulse pre-workout has been specifically designed to boost energy levels, support increased strength and endurance, and help reduce fatigue. The reason it's so effective is because each ingredient is backed by scientific research and dosed at research-backed levels. We rated this high in terms of effects, giving it a 4 out of 5. Jacob Penner, USA Weightlifting L-2 coach, has used Legion Pulse before more than two dozen workouts. He has personally tried roughly 50 pre-workouts himself, and says this is one of his favorites. \"This blend has a 1:1 ratio of l-theanine to caffeine, so you get a really balanced experience,\" he says. \"If you set aside all of the high-stim pre-workouts, this is probably one of my favorites because every time I use it, I feel energized but not over-stimulated.\" Pulse contains 8 grams of citrulline malate, which is the exact dose used in research studies showing improvements in muscular endurance and strength performance in both men and women2. Each serving also has 3.6 grams of beta-alanine, which is the recommended daily dose to lead to support improvements in muscular endurance and reduce fatigue during high-intensity exercise3. * If you've never taken beta-alanine before, just be aware that it can cause paresthesia\u2014a harmless prickling sensation usually felt in the hands, arms, or legs. This typically only happens the first week or so taking beta-alanine. We can't talk about Pulse without mentioning the 350 milligrams of caffeine (for two scoops)! It's a hefty dose that will surely give you enough energy to fuel your workouts11. This dose can be overwhelming to those who are sensitive to caffeine, but you can always just take half. To help prevent a potential energy crash post-workout, there's 350mg of L-theanine, which can help ease some of the effects associated with caffeine use4. Jacob and GGR editor Nicole Davis both really like the taste. Nicole, a precision nutrition coach, gave Blue Raspberry a 4 out of 5, saying, \"While it mixes well, it does have a bitter taste and an unpleasant aftertaste.\" Jacob, however, tried the Peach Ring flavor, and he says the taste is a 5 out of 5: \"I would drink it just for the taste.\" The only downside: Each serving is two scoops and there's only 21 servings in a bottle\u2014meaning if you take pre-workout every day you'll run through this product pretty quickly. Regardless, I'm giving Pulse an A+.

The fat loss component is less of a guarantee with few reports of an actual change in body composition. LEAN pre-workout is a supplement designed for individuals who want to lose body fat (as part of a healthy diet and exercise plan) and maintain muscle mass. The product's biggest selling point is that it contains key vitamins and minerals to help maintain healthy thyroid function and support weight loss. Jacob Penner, USA Weightlifting L-2 coach and owner of Endless Strength Weightlifting, has used LEAN before several weightlifting workouts. \"This is a fine pre-workout if you want something that isn't over-stimulating,\" he says. \"In fact, I typically use more than one scoop to get a bigger boost in energy.\" LEAN contains both [iodine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24926457/)12 and [zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746228/#:~:text=Zinc%20and%20other%20trace%20elements,result%20in%20acquired%20zinc%20deficiency.)13, which can be beneficial for supporting thyroid function, as well as [selenium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746228/#:~:text=Zinc%20and%20other%20trace%20elements,result%20in%20acquired%20zinc%20deficiency.)14, which is required by the thyroid for antioxidant function and metabolism of hormones. While these ingredients are safe to use, the benefits are usually only seen in individuals who are deficient in them. The verdict is still out there on whether or not they can aid in weight loss for otherwise healthy adults. At 180 milligrams of caffeine per serving in LEAN, you'll get a decent boost in energy and focus support11. This product also contains L-theanine, which when combined with caffeine, can provide a synergistic effect in promoting cognition and attention4. * The recommended dose of beta-alanine is 3 grams a day, so at only 2 grams per serving, LEAN is hitting just under the mark. However, there are 6 grams of citrulline malate per serving, which is the research-backed dose shown to help reduce fatigue and support improved performance in the gym2. * At about $1.65 per scoop, it's in the mid to upper range of price. That being said, you are getting a quality product free from artificial sweeteners and colors, so you may find the price is worth it. Plus, with almost 10 flavors to choose from, including Blue Raspberry, Watermelon, and Green Apple, you'll have a nice variety available. Nicole Davis, GGR editor and a certified personal trainer, tried the Tropical Punch Flavor, rating it a 5 out of 5. \"It was slightly bitter and not too sweet\u2014an okay combination,\" she says. \"It didn't dissolve completely, but that didn't affect the experience in my opinion. I didn't notice any jitters, and just a bit of tingling.\" This is a solid [pre-workout for beginners](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-pre-workout-for-beginners) or for someone who doesn't want a ton of caffeine in their supplement. I wouldn't purchase this product solely for its fat loss support claims, however it can certainly be added to a balanced diet and regular exercise to enhance its effects. |Price per serving||$1.66| |Key ingredients||Citrulline-malate, beta-alanine, caffeine| |Flavors||Watermelon, Sour Grape, Green Apple, Orange, Blue Raspberry, Strawberry Lemonade, Tropical Punch, Lemon Lime, Sour Peach| Best Pre-Workout for Beginners: Jacked Factory Nitrosurge Good for: Individuals looking for a beginner-friendly pre-workout to enhance energy and support focus in the gym* Best Pre-Workout For Beginners [ Jacked Factory Nitrosurge Pre-Workout Powder ](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/jacked-factory-nitrosurge-pre-workout-powder) [](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/jacked-factory-nitrosurge-pre-workout-powder) Product Highlights - Vegan pre-workout - 180 mg of caffeine per scoop - Manufactured in USA in cGMP certified facility Pros & Cons Pros - Available in multiple sizes: 30 or 60 servings - Subscribe and save 15% - Available in 11 flavors - 100% money-back guarantee - Manufactured in USA in cGMP certified facility - Vegan - Affordable at under $1 per serving (1 scoop serving) Cons - Mixed reviews on taste - Mixed reviews on effectiveness - Contains sucralose Bottom Line Jacked Factory Nitrosurge Pre-Workout is a generally positively reviewed pre-workout with 180 milligrams of caffeine and a large variety of flavor options. Our expert product testers agreed Jacked Factory Nitrosurge is the best pre-workout for beginners because it gives you the option to use one or two scoops with clear labeling of dosages for both options. The one-scoop option, which we recommend for beginners, provides enough energy to help you power through your workouts without overloading you with pre-workout ingredients that rookies sometimes struggle with, such as beta-alanine (the face itch is no joke). \"I like that you still get 180 milligrams of caffeine with this so you get the energy, but without all the other effects,\" says GGR Head of Content Kate Meier, who tested Nitrosurge along with members of her weightlifting team, giving it a 4 out of 5 for its effects on energy and focus. \"If you do half a scoop of other pre-workouts, you don't get all that caffeine.\" The 180 milligrams of caffeine is about what you'd get in two 8-ounce cups of coffee. One of Kate's weightlifting teammates tried a two-scoop portion and said he got a boost from it, though it was \"mild\" compared to stronger pre-workouts. Kate and her team tried the Strawberry Margarita flavor of Nitrosurge, giving it a perfect 5 out of 5 for taste. Kate calls it \"wildly delicious,\" noting, \"I'd drink this by the side of a pool over ice. I could drink it all day. It is by far my favorite pre-workout.\" Another reason we like Nitrosurge for beginners is that it's simple, and we mean that in the best way possible. Aside from caffeine, you're also getting [L-Citrulline for oxygen and nutrient delivery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31977835/)15, L-Theanine, which when combined with caffeine can help increase energy and reaction time.4 We love a pre-workout that focuses on providing high-quality ingredients, rather than some trendy stimulants with little research to back them up. It should be noted that you won't get the optimal doses of these and other ingredients if you only take one scoop, but once you're more comfortable with taking a pre-workout you can easily move onto a two-scoop serving or Arctic White, Fruit Punch, Grape, Cotton Candy, Sour Peach Rings, Blueberry Lemonade, Black Cherry| Best-Tasting Pre-Workout: Huge Supplements no-frills, ](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/huge-supplements-pump-serum-non-stim) [](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/huge-supplements-pump-serum-non-stim) Product Highlights - Available in four flavors - Formulated to improve workout performance - Claimed to increase pump and muscle fullness - Claimed to enhance endurance and increase focus Pros & Cons Pros - Reportedly effective - No post-workout crash - Taste is popular - Mixes well Cons - Sucralose may cause GI distress - Artificial ingredients - Expensive Bottom Line Although it does contain artificial ingredients, the Pump Serum Stimulant Free Pre-Workout powder is designed to pump you up for your next workout without any post-workout crash. Huge Supplements always nails the flavor department, and the Huge Supplements Pump Serum is no exception. Kate Meier, GGR's head of content, and members of her weightlifting team tested the Cherry Berry flavor and said it does indeed taste like cherry with berries. \"It isn't incredibly tart, but it is definitely sweet,\" says Kate, who added that she and her team found the pre-workout powder required more water than the packaging suggested. That's why this earns a 4 out of 5 for taste with us; otherwise, it would be a perfect score. \"I mixed it with about 20 ounces, instead of the recommended 8 to 12 ounces, and it was better.\" If Cherry Berry isn't your speed, Huge Pump Serum also comes in Jungle Juice, Island Dream, and Strawberry Mojito. Huge Supplements uses sucralose, which might give some people an artificial aftertaste but we felt that there was just enough in their pre-workout supplements. This pre-workout powder is caffeine-free, so you won't get an energy boost. Kate says it lives up to its name by giving you a noticeable pump. \"It gets the blood flowing,\" she says. In addition to 4 grams of L-Citrulline (8 grams if you take a two-scoop serving), Huge also has beet root powder extract, which has been linked with improved athletic performance and reduced muscle soreness, according to [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8565237/)16. Get your shaker cup ready: We rated this a 4 out of 5 for solubility. \"It mixes well, but it seems to settle a little, so I just shook it before every time I took it,\" Kate warns. |Price per All-in-One Pre-Workout: Kaged Pre-Kaged Good for: People looking for the all-in-one pre-workout supplement to train harder, build muscle, and support increased strength Best All-in-One Pre-Workout [ Kaged Pre-Kaged Pre-Workout ](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/kaged-pre-kaged-pre-workout) [](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/kaged-pre-kaged-pre-workout) Product Highlights Contains research-backed dosages of key ingredients like caffeine, creatine, and citrulline - Informed Sport-certified, meaning it's been tested for quality assurance and banned substances. - 7 flavors are available Pros & Cons Pros - Good formulation of research-backed ingredients - Label transparency - 7 flavors and users overwhelmingly like the taste Cons - Big serving size - Expensive Bottom Line Kaged Pre-Kaged is expensive, but is formulated with research-backed dosages of key ingredients like caffeine, creatine, beta-alanine, and citrulline. Pre-Kaged is the one-stop shop when it comes to pre-workouts. It's fully loaded with all the ingredients you'd want in a pre-workout and has 100% transparency on the label so you know exactly what active ingredients (and how much of each) you're putting in your body. Anthony O'Reilly, GGR performance editor and pre-workout aficionado, has taken this before a number of strength-based workouts. He says, \"I like this for workouts where I'm focusing on muscular endurance, which might be due to the fact that there's coconut water powder in it. I've lost count on my reps after taking this because I feel like I can just keep curling/pressing/whatever I'm doing cause I just don't get as fatigued.\" It's one of the most popular pre-workouts on the market, and for good reason. It's formulated with research-backed ingredients, and because it contains good dosages for key ingredients (e.g. caffeine, creatine, citrulline), you won't need to purchase additional dietary supplements to fill any pre-workout gaps. That's good, because Pre-Kaged is expensive, costing $2.25 per serving\u2014the most expensive on our list. Anthony does warn that this isn't necessarily the best pre-workout for a pump. \"I don't get the same oomph or pump that I get from something like Transparent Labs,\" he says. Pre-Kaged gets a gold star for being third-party tested, as well as Informed Sport-certified. This is a must-have for me\u2014I won't recommend any product that hasn't been batch-tested to ensure quality. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the large scoop size. Perhaps if they took out the 6.5 grams of BCAAs (because let's face it, they don't really do much for you), you could easily mix it with 6 ounces of water and have it down in no time. In terms of flavor, both Anthony and Nicole Davis, GGR editor and certified personal trainer, says the taste gets a perfect 5-out-of-5 rating. \"I tried the Krisp Apple flavor, and definitely noticed the smell of apples as soon as I opened my shaker,\" Nicole says. \"It wasn't too sweet and I liked the flavor, but found that there was an unpleasant mouth-feel after each sip. It also didn't mix super well. It's actually a little thick.\" Read more in Apple, Orange Crush, Cherry Bomb| Best Caffeine-Free Pre-Workout: Onnit Total Strength + Performance Good a nature-based, caffeine-free pre-workout Best Pre-Workout ](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/onnit-total-strength-performance-pre-workout) [](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/onnit-total-strength-performance-pre-workout) Product Highlights - Plant-based - Blended with botanical ingredients, vitamins, and adaptogens - Third-party tested - Deemed banned substance-tested Pros & Cons Pros - Website links to controlled studies - Plant-based - Band-substance tested and approved - Gluten-, soy-, dairy-, and caffeine-free Cons - Only one flavor - Some consumers did not like the taste - Some consumers also say it does not mix well Bottom Line Onnit's Total Strength & Performance provides a unique blend of botanical ingredients, adaptogens, and vitamins to enhance performance leading to research-backed strength gains. [Onnit's](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/onnit-coupon-code) Total Strength + Performance pre workout is formulated to support improved physical performance, and prompt strength and power gains. The main ingredients are divided into three proprietary blend categories, so while I can't tell the exact dosage of each ingredient, we can take a closer look at what each ingredient/category is intended to do. RELATED: [Onnit Coupon Code](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/onnit-coupon-code) The Performance Blend is a combination of BCAAs, glutamine, and beta-alanine. Out of those three, beta-alanine has the most research backing up its use as a performance aid. When taken consistently for four weeks, beta-alanine can increase muscular endurance and help delay fatigue3. * The second category is the Power Blend, and contains a handful of ingredients linked to maintaining hormone health. The combination of [d-aspartic acid](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19860889/)17, [longjack extract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28259255/)18, and [nettle root extract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7510891/)19 may assist with supporting testosterone production. Without knowing the exact dose of each ingredient, it's difficult to say whether or not you'll see a noticeable effect. * The Support Blend is the third category and contains red clover extract, luteolin, and resveratrol.

So long as you are not on the hunt for a product that contains creatine, this may work for you. Cira Pre-Game is a pre-workout designed specifically with women in mind. It's formulated to support increased energy, endurance, focus, and strength, and it's a great product for both women and any first-time pre-workout user. Nicole Davis, GGR senior editor and certified personal trainer, used Cira Pre-Game before CrossFit classes and gave it a 5 out of 5 for its positive effects. \"I definitely felt energized, but there was no crash and no tingles,\" she says. Overall, Cira did a nice job with their product formulation, earning a 4 out of 5 from our registered dietitians. A couple of the ingredients, like betaine anhydrous and L-Tyrosine, are slightly underdosed; however, it does deliver an adequate dose of caffeine10 (200 milligrams), L-citrulline15 (6,000 milligrams), L-Theanine4 (100 milligrams), and beta-alanine3 (1,600 milligrams)\u2014all ingredients that can promote increased energy, focus, and drive during your workouts.* In terms of taste, Nicole has this to say, \"I tried Pink Candy, and actually really liked it. The consistency is a bit thicker than some other pre-workouts, but it really does taste like cotton candy. \" The only con for me is the omission of creatine, an ingredient shown to increase strength and enhance recovery in both men and women7.

Perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised, since this pre-workout supplement was designed by Jim Stoppani, who holds a doctorate degree in exercise physiology and is one of the most prominent names in the nutrition space. Caffeine, of course, is one of the primary ingredients that help with increased focus11, as is [Huperzine A](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19221692/)20 and L-Tyrosine5. Additionally, each serving comes with a gram of Taurine, which \"Plays an important role as a basic factor for maintaining cellular integrity in the heart, muscle, retina, and throughout the [central nervous system],\" and, according to [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3501277/)21, could act as a neurotransmitter. In terms of taste, both Anthony and Jacob rate this a near-perfect 4.5 out of 5. \"I want to drink the Pineapple Strawberry flavor while on a beach,\" Anthony says. \"Rainbow sherbet is pretty good, just like getting a mouthful of sweetness,\" Jacob says.

However, if you are sensitive or want to avoid stimulants, this may not be the supplement for you. Gorilla Mode has been formulated specifically to support increased energy, focus, muscle strength, and endurance. The combination of L-Citrulline15, [GlycerPump](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3590833/)22, and [Agmatine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3975019/)23 can boost nitric oxide production, promote increased blood flow, and improve intramuscular hydration. Several people tested Gorilla Mode for us, including Jacob Penner, USA Weightlifting L-2 coach and owner of Endless Strength Weightlifting Club. \"Two hours later, I still feel pumped up like I did while I was working out, and I am not crashing the way you sometimes do after taking a strong pre-workout,\" he says. Moving down the ingredient list, we see a unique blend of nootropics designed to support enhanced focus and mood8. The combination of L-Tyrosine5, [Kanna](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8124331/)24, and Huperzine A20 are known for their cognitive-supporting properties and their ability to help ease daily stress. Add in the 160 milligrams of caffeine and 2,500 milligrams of creatine per serving and you have yourself a pre-workout cocktail that could help get you closer to your goal of bigger, stronger muscles7. \"I'll be honest and say the full two-scoop dose scared me so I halved it,\" says Nicole Davis, GGR senior editor and certified personal trainer who also tested Gorilla Mode. \"That was the perfect amount of energy.\" RELATED: [Best Creatine](Best Creatine) If you're an athlete, or undergo regular drug testing, you may need to check if N-Phenethyl Dimethylamine Citrate (also known as Eria Jarensis extract) is an approved ingredient to take.

Nicole, says, \"The Fruit Punch flavor smells and tastes like Hawaiian Punch, so I was instantly transported to childhood.\" Jacob says, \"I tried Bombsicle.

It's carbohydrate-free and contains 150 milligrams of caffeine per serving\u2014a similar dose found in about 1.5 cups of coffee. At under $1 per serving, it's also one of the most budget-friendly pre-workout powders on the market (most pre-workouts range from $1.50-$2 per serving). Many people at Garage Gym Reviews have used both the C4 powder and the drink. Here, we will dive into the specs of the powder. Anthony O'Reilly, an editor here and a certified personal trainer, says C4 has become one of his go-to pre-workouts. \"I will sometimes do a caffeine detox, and this is a great powder for dipping your toes back into the stim pool,\" he says. \"You're not going to get Mr. Olympia-level pumps from it, but your sleeves will feel a bit tighter than they were before you started the workout.\" It also contains 1.6 grams of beta-alanine, which, if taken consistently, can help reduce the accumulation of metabolic waste productions (like hydrogen ions) and help prevent muscular fatigue3.

According to their website, it's designed to enhance your energy, strength, and power using nature-based, vegan-friendly ingredients. Like all Naked Nutrition products, their pre-workout is third-party tested to ensure quality and safety, and it's suitable for both men and women. The formulation of Naked Energy is simple: It only contains 10 ingredients, but that doesn't make it any less effective.

RELATED: [Best Muscle Recovery Supplements](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-muscle-recovery-supplements) Some reviews claim the taste is less than desirable, but the potential benefits far outweigh the taste profile and at less than a dollar per serving, it's worth giving it a go. |Price per serving||$0.90| For A Pump: 4 Gauge Good for: People looking for the perfect mix of muscle pumps and enhanced performance out of their pre-workout * Best Pre-Workout For A Pump [ 4 Gauge Pre-Workout ](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/4-gauge-pre-workout) [](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/4-gauge-pre-workout) Product Highlights - 4 claimed benefits in just one serving: \"explosive power, improved focus, extra stamina, and an intense muscle pump\" - Third-party-tested - Company emphasizes transparency in reporting accurate dosages of each ingredient Pros & Cons Pros - Nature-based ingredients - No proprietary blends - No artificial sweeteners - No preservatives - Tastes good according to users - Third-party tested Cons - Expensive - Lower dose of caffeine at 150mg (not a deal breaker but definitely an issue for some) - Only one flavor Bottom Line Although expensive, 4 Gauge pre-workout supplement provides research-backed doses of high-quality and nature-based ingredients to give users the best possible outcomes. According to their website, 4 Gauge is an \"explosive\" pre-workout designed to be one of the strongest pre-workouts on the market. The product claims to increase muscle pumps, support improved focus and motivation, promote blood flow, and increase stamina so you can work out longer and harder. Taking a closer look at the ingredient label, I can see that 4 Gauge uses research-backed ingredients to provide a balance between strength, focus, energy, and muscle pumps. * Nicole Davis, GGR Editor and our expert product tester, says: \"We gave this one the 'best pre-workout for a pump' title and I agree with that\u2014I felt pretty jacked during and after my workout!\" 4 Gauge provides 150 milligrams of caffeine per serving\u2014not the highest amount we've seen in pre-workouts, but enough to provide a small boost of energy11.

It only comes in one flavor, so you might be out of luck if Fruit Punch isn't your jam. And at $2.25 per serving, it can get quite pricey if you use pre-workout even multiple times per week. \"4 Gauge mixes really well, but I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor,\" Nicole says. \"If you're someone who doesn't like overly sweet pre-workouts, this might be a great Good for: People who are focusing on adding muscle mass to their physique Best Pre-Workout for Muscle Gain [ BlackWolf Pre-Workout ](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/blackwolf-pre-workout) [](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/equipment/blackwolf-pre-workout) Product Highlights - Stimulant-free - Backed by over 25 clinical trials - Available in 3 flavors - Mixes well - One flavor is caffeine-free Pros & Cons Pros - Stimulant-free - Tastes great - Mixes well - No post-workout crash - Caffeine-free option - 11 scientifically backed ingredients - Free 10-week training program and cookbook included with purchase Cons - The dosage of beta-alanine can cause tingling and itching of the skin - No user reviews on their website Bottom Line BlackWolf Pre-Workout contains 11 scientifically proven ingredients designed to improve energy, focus, and performance without any unwanted side effects.

This product also contains creatine monohydrate7 and [betaine anhydrous](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2651845/)29, both of which can assist with muscle strength and exercise performance. Despite the absence of caffeine, you can still expect support for focus and concentration due to the addition of DMAE13 and Huperzine A18. These powerful nootropics can enhance cognitive function during workouts. * Apart from the pricier cost per serving ($2.05), this is a top-rated supplement sure to give you more drive and focus during your workouts.

This pre-workout beta-alanine, L-tyrosine, taurine, and elevATP, a compound claimed to increase ATP activity in muscle cells. We gave Transparent Labs Stim-Free pre-workout a near-perfect 4.5 out of 5 on its formulation. It is essentially a caffeine-free version of their standard pre-workouts for those who prefer to train at night, or simply want all their caffeine to come from coffee.

Huperzine A20, Taurine, and L-Tyrosine are also added to help with mental focus, especially since there's no caffeine to help with mental alertness. Anthony O'Reilly, GGR's performance editor and expert product tester, said he didn't miss the caffeine jolt. \"I usually need a little pick-me-up to remain focused on my workouts,\" Anthony says, \"but after taking this I might have to change my supplement stack. I felt focused at all times and there was no energy crash at the end of my workout.\" Sodium and potassium act primarily as electrolytes to promote hydration, though [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11064849/)31 tell us they can also assist in helping you get a pump. Similarly, beetroot powder is added for color and can also help improve nitric oxide production27.

Some of the other ingredients, like L-Citrulline, are underdosed, and each serving only has 6 grams of active ingredients. Additionally, the product contains a proprietary energy blend, so it is difficult to know how much Theobromine, Phosphatidylcholine, or Yohimbe extract is actually in the product. - BPN Flight Pre-Workout: Although it contains more than 300 milligrams of stimulants, BPN's Flight only has 2 grams of L-Citruline and the recommended dose is closer to 6-8 grams.

We took the individual flavor and full range of flavors into consideration. We also looked at whether unflavored options were available. Solubility How well does this product dissolve in the suggested amount of liquid? Are there floaties? Is it grainy? Is it super thick or super thin? Does it separate after a few minutes? Cost and Price Per Serving The price per serving can range from $0.80 on the low end to upwards of $2 on the high end. Customer Reviews What do customers think of the product? Are reviews consistent? Does the company interact with customer reviews? Value If a pre-workout is expensive, is it at least packed with unique ingredients that you couldn't find in cheaper pre-workouts? If not, you might as well buy a more affordable supplement. Transparency and Third-Party Testing Since dietary supplements are not approved by the FDA, having an independent third-party lab verify that what's on the label is what's in the pre-workout is super important, especially for athletes. This is particularly important for pre-workouts, because overloading on stimulants can be dangerous. Transparency also plays a part in this\u2014does the company provide COAs, not use proprietary blends, and generally seem very upfront about what's used in their pre-workout and why? Pre-Workout Supplement Ingredients When you're on the search for a good pre-workout formula, make sure it contains a majority\u2014if not all\u2014of the common [pre-workout ingredients](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-pre-workout-ingredients) below. Caffeine Caffeine is a stimulant that targets the central nervous system, helping to support increased mental alertness while reducing the perception of fatigue11. Additionally, it can increase fat oxidation and [spare muscle glycogen levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34684336/)33. * Creatine Creatine is a naturally occurring substrate that aids in energy production. When taken as a dietary supplement, creatine has been shown to promote increased muscle strength, muscle size, speed, and high-intensity exercise capacity7. * Citrulline L-citrulline is an amino acid that helps increase the body's production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide supports improved blood flow via vasodilation (widening of blood vessels)15. * Citrulline Malate Citrulline malate is a compound that combines citrulline with malate, a substrate essential for the production of energy needed for muscle contractions. Citrulline malate has been shown to help delay muscle fatigue and increase oxygen delivery to muscles2. * Beta-alanine Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid that binds with histidine to form carnosine. In your muscles, carnosine acts as a hydrogen ion buffer to help delay fatigue and improve high-intensity exercise performance3. * Benefits of Pre-Workout Wondering why you should consider drinking a pre-workout before your next sweat session? Some benefits include: Promotes Increased Energy Pre-workouts are probably best known for their ability to support increased energy and focus during workouts. Caffeine is well-known for its ability to boost energy and endurance levels during intense workouts11, and nitric oxide boosters (like citrulline14 and beetroot extract27) can promote blood flow, which may result in more oxygen and nutrients being delivered to your muscles to maximize performance. * Improves Muscle Strength Pre-workouts can enhance strength in several ways. For one, they can provide you with more energy so that you hit your workouts harder and increase your training volume. Pre-workouts can also help you recover faster in between sessions so you're taking less time off. * But, perhaps the most important ingredient for increasing strength is creatine. Creatine, which is present in some pre-workouts, aids in energy production during short, intense efforts and has been shown to increase strength when combined with resistance training in numerous research studies7. * Supports Enhanced Cognition Ingredients like L-Theanine4, Rhodiola rosea12, and L-Tyrosine5 can help you stay focused and motivated throughout your workout. Nootropics like these have also been shown to enhance memory, attention, and concentration8. Combat Fatigue One way to boost stamina during your workouts is to combat feelings of fatigue. Caffeine has been shown to stimulate the release of endorphins, which in turn can lower one's perception of effort and muscle pain associated with exercise11. Supplementation with beta-alanine3 has been shown to increase intramuscular stores of carnosine. Carnosine works as an intracellular buffer to reduce the accumulation of hydrogen ions- [ultimately delaying fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5622748/)34. What To Look For in Pre-Workout When you're ready to purchase a pre-workout, keep these factors in mind. Look For Key Ingredients Caffeine11, citrulline15, beta-alanine3, and creatine7 can help maximize your energy and strength while reducing fatigue. * Research-Backed Dosages Make sure key ingredients are present in research-backed dosages. There are countless research studies that pinpoint the minimal dose needed to experience energy- or strength-boosting effects from ingredients like beta-alanine and creatine, but here are a few you should know before you start shopping: Research-backed doses of pre-workout ingredients: - Caffeine: 200 milligrams - Creatine: At least 3 grams (5 grams is the daily recommended dose per day but not many pre-workouts contain this much) - Citrulline: 6 grams - Citrulline Malate: 6-8 grams - Beta-Alanine: 3 grams Try To Avoid Proprietary Blends These blends will make it difficult to know the exact dosages used. A detailed ingredient list that clearly states the dose of each ingredient will ensure you know exactly what you are consuming. Choose Products That Are Third-Party Tested This means that a company, not affiliated with the supplement manufacturer, evaluates the dietary supplement to ensure what is printed on the label is actually inside the product. Check Twice If You're An Athlete If you're an athlete, it's critical that your pre-workout is free from any banned substance. Look for the Informed Sport, NSF, or Banned Substance Control Group (BSCG) logos on the product's packaging to ensure the product has been batch-tested. RELATED: [Best supplements for men](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-supplements-for-men) Is Pre-Workout Dangerous? When taken as directed, pre-workouts are generally considered safe to use for healthy individuals. There are special populations, like pregnant women and adolescents, who should avoid them altogether though. Always check with your doctor before taking a new supplement. If you're taking a new pre-workout, it's recommended that you start with half the dose to see how your body reacts and then gradually increase from there. You should never consume more than the recommended dose, especially if the product contains stimulants like caffeine. When Should I Take Pre-Workout? The name pretty much gives it away\u2014pre-workouts should be taken before your training session, with most people downing their supplement 20-30 minutes before they intend to start seriously training. The key phrase there is \"seriously\" training because you don't want the caffeine to hit while you're stretching or warming up and wear off before you even hit the weights. If you're someone who works out in the afternoons or evenings, you should know that caffeine can sometimes stay in your system several hours after you take it. That means if you down a pre-workout even at 1 p.m., the caffeine can cause disruptions in your sleep cycle or make it hard for you to fall asleep in the first place. Consider using one of the best [stim-free pre-workouts](https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-stim-free-pre-workout) or moving your workout to earlier in the day.

Pre-workouts are okay to take on a regular basis, but keep in mind that you can build up tolerance to stimulants, like caffeine. It's recommended that you cycle off stimulant-containing supplements every couple of months for 6 to 8 weeks. This will give your body some time to reset. Stimulant-free pre-workouts can be taken every day without cycling on/off. Is C4 a good pre-workout? C4 is manufactured by Cellucor, a well-known and established company in the supplement space, and is one of the most popular pre-workouts on the market. It's affordable and no-frills, but still contains important ingredients like caffeine and beta-alanine. We recommend it on our list of best pre-workouts because of these attributes.

Dry scooping is a term used to describe taking a pre-workout powder without dissolving it in a fluid. It is no more effective than mixing a pre-workout in water, and can be potentially dangerous. Dry scooping can cause choking if the powder is accidentally inhaled, and can even cause a sudden increase in heart and blood pressure due to the immediate hit of caffeine to your system. It is recommended that you follow the instructions listed on the product label and mix your pre-workout powder in 8 to 12 ounces of water. * These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
