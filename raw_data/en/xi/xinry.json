Tinnitus affects about [1 in 10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9847569/) There are numerous treatments for tinnitus, which include treating the underlying causes, receiving cognitive therapy, and masking the noises with other sounds. This article looks at how to get immediate relief from tinnitus, six potential natural remedies, and when to contact a doctor. It also briefly examines the medical treatments available for the condition. There is no cure for tinnitus, but there are techniques and interventions to help a person manage the symptoms and their impact on mental health and quality of life. Treatment options for [tinnitus](/articles/156286/) aim to reduce the distress that the condition can cause. [Two options](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7493236/) [relaxation techniques](/articles/5-relaxation-techniques-to-try/) and sound therapy. Relaxation techniques Several relaxation techniques may help a person remove focus from tinnitus and address the emotional and mental impact of the condition. These [include](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/relaxation-techniques-what-you-need-to-know) - Breathing exercises: Deep breathing can help a person relax. A simple breathing method involves sitting or lying down with one hand on the stomach and one on the chest. The person should inhale slowly until their stomach rises, hold their breath for a moment, and then slowly exhale and feel their stomach fall. - Meditation: There are many [types of meditation](/articles/320392). Meditation typically involves a person focusing their attention to help them relax. A person may focus on their breath, on relaxing different parts of their body, or on allowing thoughts to surface and then pass. Sound therapy [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7493236/) One type of sound therapy that may be beneficial for people with tinnitus is masking. This involves the use of masking the tinnitus with other sounds, which can provide relief from the constant or monotonous noise of tinnitus. The masking sounds could be music, [white noise](/articles/white-noise-apps/), ambient noise, or customized sounds. In [mindfulness meditation](/articles/mindfulness-meditation-for-anxiety), a person observes thoughts, sensations, and feelings in a nonjudgmental way, which may help reduce negativity and anxiety. A [2019 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838968/) The studies were of moderate-high quality, and the evidence was clinically significant enough to suggest that mindfulness meditation may be an effective treatment for distress from tinnitus. A [2017 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28357966/) [Yoga](/articles/317314/) is a combination of mind and body practices that can reduce anxiety and stress, which may help reduce the impact of tinnitus symptoms. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786150/) More research is necessary to determine how effective yoga may be as a treatment for tinnitus. Further research may also analyze how yoga could improve tinnitus symptoms. [Acupuncture](/articles/156488) is a form of Chinese medicine that people have used for thousands of years to treat a variety of health issues. It involves inserting thin needles into locations of the body at different depths. Authors of a [2018 randomized clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771359/) Some research found no significant benefits, while others found that acupuncture may improve sleep and quality of life and [reduce stress](/articles/145855/) in people with tinnitus. However, the clinical trial found that acupuncture was effective and can reduce the loudness and severity of tinnitus in some people. Evidence supporting acupuncture for tinnitus is inconclusive. [Acai](/articles/305576) products contain fruit from the acai palm tree. Acai fruit is rich in [polyphenols](/articles/319728), minerals, fibers, and lipids, and people often use it for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. One [randomized, placebo-controlled study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9886123/) Acai supplements may be but researchers have found a [possible connection](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/acai) [Chagas' disease](/articles/chagas-disease-symptoms), also known as American trypanosomiasis. Experts do not have much information on the safety of acai during pregnancy and [breastfeeding or chestfeeding](/articles/breastfeeding/). Acai may also affect MRI results. People use the root of the [ginseng](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/262982) plant, native to China and Korea, for a variety of health benefits. [Researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9847569/) [hearing loss](/articles/249285/) and cochlear damage. More research and large-scale studies are necessary to determine how effective ginseng may be as a treatment for tinnitus. One study found that people who took 3,000 milligrams of ginseng per day had a significant reduction in the severity of tinnitus compared with people who received smaller doses or took ginkgo biloba. Ginseng is [likely safe](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/asian-ginseng) [insomnia](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9155/), digestive issues, and menstrual problems. [Ginkgo biloba](/articles/263105) is an extract from the leaves of the ginkgo tree. According to a [2022 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9847569/) Although many studies have investigated ginkgo biloba as a treatment for tinnitus, the evidence of its efficacy is inconclusive or unreliable. A [2019 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6926930/) As well as there being a lack of evidence to support the efficacy of the extract, research also suggests that ginkgo biloba can be potentially harmful. Ginkgo may interact with [anticoagulant medications](/articles/anticoagulant-drugs), which reduce blood clot formation. Because of this, ginkgo may cause severe bleeding and increase the risk of bleeding in people with [clotting disorders](/articles/coagulation-disorders). The authors of the review mention a [worldwide survey](https://pubs.asha.org/doi/abs/10.1044/2016_AJA-16-0021) of people who used supplements to treat tinnitus. The survey found that ginko was the most commonly reported supplement to cause adverse effects. These included: - headache [nausea](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/269511) [diarrhea](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158634) - dizziness - bleeding [chest pain](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321650) [increased urination](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/70782) - changes in blood pressure [palpitation](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318275) Someone should contact a doctor if they: - experience anxiety, depression, stress, or other [mental health conditions](/articles/154543/)as a result of tinnitus - have [difficulty sleeping](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327339/)as a result of tinnitus - require [earwax](/articles/322247/)or object removal from an ear, which may be the cause of tinnitus - develop new or sudden tinnitus - experience hearing loss, [vertigo](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/160900/), or other neurological symptoms - hear rhythmic, pulsing sounds, such as a heartbeat, which could indicate a cardiovascular problem - discover that their tinnitus is audible to other people Treatment of tinnitus differs depending on the underlying causes. Treatment for tinnitus aims to reduce the symptoms and help a person manage the effects of the symptoms. There is no cure for the condition, but the following treatment options may [provide relief](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430809/) - medication, such as [antidepressants](/articles/248320)and [benzodiazepines](/articles/262809), to treat mental health symptoms caused by tinnitus [cognitive behavioral therapy](/articles/296579)to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression as a result of tinnitus - sound masking to provide relief from tinnitus by replacing it with other soothing sounds [hearing aids](/articles/hearing-aids-for-tinnitus), which may improve hearing and can feature built-in masking noise There is no cure for tinnitus, but there are treatments that can improve the symptoms and address the mental health effects of tinnitus. Common natural remedies for tinnitus include natural supplements, such as ginkgo biloba, acai, and ginseng. Acupuncture, yoga, and mindfulness meditation may also be beneficial. More research is necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of herbal supplements as a treatment for tinnitus, and there is no clinically relevant evidence to support their use. Yoga may be useful in reducing the impact of tinnitus symptoms and helping a person manage the condition. Mindful meditation may be a particularly helpful treatment for distress caused by tinnitus, and research supports it as an effective treatment. "}
