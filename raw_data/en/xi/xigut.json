And today, we still believe in the spiritual nature, inherent dignity, and worth of every person! This core belief means that we begin every interaction with a conscious awareness of the inherent goodness of the other. It also means that we celebrate and promote the uniqueness of every individual in our care. One of the distinctive aspects about St. Joseph's is the integration of spirituality into the treatment experience. We understand spirituality as a core dimension of personhood, and thus, we provide spiritual care as an essential part of our holistic treatment approach. Our Spiritual Health team will work carefully with you during your treatment stay, providing compassionate and transformative presence. Through this, we see people develop a healthy connection with themselves, others, and the transcendent. We are here for you. And we will walk with you on the spiritual pathway.
