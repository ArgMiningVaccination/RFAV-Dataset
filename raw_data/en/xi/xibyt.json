If you have clicked on this page, it may be because you want the truth about vaccinations, your pet has suffered a vaccination reaction or some form of vaccinosis, you are seeking an alternative to vaccines, or you are just curious. I have posted the following information in order to provide the straightforward truth about vaccines. Great credit is given to Dr. Lita Radford, D.A., Hom. from whose website I found the following article. It is highly informative regarding the harmful effects of vaccinations and the hidden truths the public is unaware of, including most veterinarians and medical doctors. Understanding Vaccinosis Vaccinosis is the term applied to the state of disease, most often chronic - long term, which occurs in humans and animals after immunization vaccinations have been administered. For most pets the symptoms are not easily recognized in the beginning, an insidious disease, taking weeks, months, and sometimes even years before the care-giver realizes what has occurred over this period of time, and the root cause. Sadly, some people never discover that the root cause started with vaccines. Our human and animal bodies, in a state of optimal health, are capable of developing natural immunity to invading substances without the use of vaccines. \"Optimal Health\" would be a state of health in which all of the cells of our body were perfectly healthy, functioning without hindrance of toxins or poorly performing organs and reduced enzymatic processes. \"Natural immunity\" is the function of our cells building a defense against viral and other harmful substances with which we may come into contact. And \"without vaccines\" means exactly what it says: Without the use of toxin-filled, manufactured immunization vaccinations administered 'unnaturally' into ours or our pets muscles without having been tested for long term safety; nor for damaging, permanent side effects. Immunization vaccines contain toxic substances. Most people are not informed of this nor the risks of such toxins prior to the administration of vaccines for themselves, their children or their pets. Many people are told or left to assume that vaccines are required, when in fact they are not legally required for children or animals with the exception of local laws for rabies vaccines. Among the toxins used in vaccines: formaldehyde, aluminum, hydrolyzed gelatin, animal tissues and blood, and animal viruses. In light of the first three paragraphs before you, we should take a look at the ever increasing question that the more well-informed, self-educated clients are taking to veterinarians, \"Why do you pump vaccinations into my companion animal every year?\" A potpourri of answers may result in asking this question, but the common answer from still-naive Veterinarians is \"..for their safety and protection against harmful diseases.\" However, more often the truth behind any answer is quite simply \"capital gain.\" The profit made on vaccines every year is quite a high percentage of a veterinarians income. This is a truth admitted by holistic veterinarians who do understand the dangers involved in over-vaccination and who understand this problem from all angles. What's more, administering vaccines further ensures a percentage of income resulting when the client and their animals return repeatedly, with the insidious start of vaccinosis. \"Doctor, my Fluffy-Boy keeps biting his knees and now he's got an ear infection...\" and \"Doctor, now my Fluffy-Boy has this rash and is urinating in the house..\" Now, we ask you, how do we enlighten more of these veterinarians that they can earn plenty of money for decades to come, just trying to treat dis-eased furkids with natural, gentle, alternative health care and natural preventive methods? There is no reason our pets should suffer needlessly with vaccinosis; ruined immune systems brought on by over-vaccination. Symptoms of any kind are signs of ill health; an internal struggle. A symptom itself is not *the* dis-ease. While a biological system may be functioning at slightly less than peak performance we may not see signs or *symptoms* that there is an internal derangement of health and function. The point at which we see such signs of dis-ease, the body with all its wonderful enzymatic functions and cell communications has already been struggling to correct the problem \"silently\" for some time. When it does throw out a visually detectable symptom of vaccinosis it is a sign of distress, deep toxicity, a derangement of health - the body needs help. This is the point at which we need to recognize there is a problem, and seek to treat it with the safest possible methods and natural medicine. Immediate concerns to address are an improved diet, better nutrition, detoxification of the body systems, and use of various natural healing modalities including homeopathy to attempt to return the diseased body to a state of health, if it's not too late to do so. Unfortunately, the majority of allopathic \"conventional\" veterinarians are not trained to address any of these concerns with the use of natural preventive and healing methods. There are still, to-date, far too few all holistic veterinarians nationwide to treat the rapidly growing number of urgent health care cases, such as vaccinosis. When Vaccinosis symptoms are treated and suppressed with allopathic drugs (cortisone, prednisone, antibiotics, pain killers etc.) and the animal continues to be assaulted with [these] foreign substances [often including still more vaccine 'boosters' right on schedule, every year, as if this were necessary and as if the vaccines were harmless] the resulting advanced illnesses, auto immune diseases, cancers and death may occur even more rapidly than the unknowing pet owner could ever imagine. They're often left, within weeks or months, with a broken heart, an empty wallet, and still no acceptable answers as to why their previously \"happy and healthy\" looking pets had to die or be euthanized. Again, they just don't make the connection between the date of the cat or dog's vaccine boosters and the trail of health problems that followed slowly along the pet's decline. An important note here for everyone to remember is that the vaccines vials and/or inserts state clearly enough for any veterinarian to read, that the vaccines should *only* be administered to *healthy* animals. When this caution is not met, the animal is almost assured to fall to the chronic diseased state of vaccinosis. So that you may recognize when your animal is struggling with disease and health issues [whether from vaccinosis vaccine induced, or some other cause] and when he should NOT be vaccinated, listed below are some of the many symptoms of poor health you will want to watch for and make note of in a journal [symptoms which may also follow within days, weeks or a few months of vaccination administration]. These should alert you immediately to an underlying dis-eased and poor state of health so that you, the pet owner, can inform the veterinarian that vaccines are a risk to your animal's well-being; and remind them that your pet should not be vaccinated while experiencing these health issues. In the event a rabies vaccination is 'due' and is required by law in your area, discuss these risks with your veterinarian and request that he sign a health *waiver which you may take to your county and ask them to please accept in lieu of a vaccination for their records. #1 SKIN PROBLEMS including but not limited to any one or more of the following and located anywhere on the animal: rash, flaking, crusts, pimples, cysts, ulcers, hard or soft bumps, skin growths, cancer, urticaria - aka hives, warts, scabs, flakes, oozing watery or thick moisture, inflammation, redness, swellings including oedema, itching, discolorations (brown; black: grey; white etc), red flushed skin especially after eating, sagging wrinkled skin, fur loss, hot spots, thickening skin, fragility (thin; bleeds easily; tears easily when scratched), hardness / induration, psoriasis, eczema, blisters. #2 Ear infections internal or external and affections including boils, cysts, thickened or swollen ears, hematomas, discharges of fluid, pus, wax etc. #3 Kidney & Urinary problems including but not limited to symptoms such as urinary tract infections, formations of stones, sudden imbalances in acidity or alkalinity, blood or mucus in urine, increased or decreased urination, more frequent outings needed for dogs and possible 'accidents' in the house, urination outside of the litterbox for cats or 'meow-ling' with pain before, during or after using the litterbox, sensitivity to being touched in kidney region, foul and changed odor of urine, discoloration & more. #4 Liver, Pancreatic, & otherwise poor Gastrointestinal & digestive functions including but not limited to stool color changes to anything but a normal healthy brown coloration (green, white, black, clay grey, tan, orange, yellow etc), blood in stools, undigested food in stools, various changes in stool consistency as is often found in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, inflammatory bowel disorders, diarrhea, constipation, gas, bloating, burping, vomiting, weight loss, emaciation, weight gain, etc. #5 Eye disorders including but not limited to blindness and opacity / whiteness, conjunctivitis / redness and inflammation, dryness, lachrymation or 'watery' eyes, brown discharge from eyes, eye crusts, green or other color discharges from eyes, swelling of eyes, \"cherry\" eyes, drooping eyelids, and more. #6 Paw, Pads, and Toenail issues including loss of toenails, brittleness, softness, inflammation of skin around toenails with or without discharges, pimples or cysts on or between toes or pads, rough or dryness of pads, inflammation of skin, fur loss and more. # 7 Epileptic fits, neurological symptoms, memory loss, aggressive behavior, autism, brain damage, facial swelling, rotting teeth, receding gums, allergies, asthma, chest pain, heart disorders, and more. Any symptom is an indication that there is a problem with the health of your animal because a healthy properly functioning body and immune system would have none of these signs of a struggle for balance, wellness, \"homeostasis.\" Quite often the connection can be made when looking back on an animal's health and treatment history which shows flare ups or the start of symptoms following either the first puppy or kitten vaccinations, or booster vaccinations. These later become worse after administration of suppressant drugs, surgical operations etc. Vaccinosis can be evident within minutes or days, or may be a gradual decline of the pet's health, becoming total failure of system functions, possibly ending in early death. Please ask Dr. Fenton about the various homeopathic formulations that can be used to help the body cope with vaccines and other alternatives "}
