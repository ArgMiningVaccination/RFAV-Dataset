In France some essential oils are regulated as prescription drugs, and thus administered by a physician. In many countries they are included in the national pharmacopeia. Essential oils, phytoncides and other natural VOCs work in different ways. At the scent level they activate the limbic system and trigger emotions. When applied to the skin (commonly in form of \"massage oils\" i.e. 1-10% solutions of EO in carrier oil) they activate thermal receptors, and kill microbes and fungi. Internal application of essential oil preparations (mainly in pharmacological drugs; generally not recommended for home use) may stimulate the immune system, urine secretion, may have antiseptic activity etc. Different essential oils have very different activity; they are studied in pharmacology and aromachology. It is significant to note the concept of chemotype in essential oil chemistry. Eucalyptus, for example, has many species, such as Eucalyptus globulus (main component is 1,8 cineole), Eucalyptus citriodora (citral), Eucalyptus menthol, and others. Properties of the essential oils of the same generic name are not all the same; they can differ widely in their chemical components. Likewise, their chemical makeup depends on the method of extraction (e.g. pressed and distilled bergamot oil have different uses). The practitioner must be aware of these factors. For medicinal aromatherapy the essential oil specification must meet the following criteria: Application While the practice of aromatherapy is sometimes thought to be confined to inhalation, it may include various methods, including: Therapeutic effects Aromatherapy is based mainly on the following therapeutic effects: One of the best known essential oils for aromatherapy is lavender, which is recommended by practitioners for treating wounds, to enhance memory, and to aid sleep by combating anxiety and insomnia. Other popular scents include eucalyptus, rose, jasmine and bergamot. Aromatherapy is among the fastest growing fields in alternative and holistic medicine. Aromatherapy is sometimes used in clinics and hospitals for treatment of pain relief, for labor pain, for relieving pain caused by the side effects of the chemotherapy, and for the rehabilitation of cardiac patients. Criticism While pleasant scents can be relaxing, lowering stress and related effects, there is currently little scientific proof of the effectiveness of aromatherapy. Like many alternative therapies, few controlled, double-blind studies have been carried out\u2014a common explanation is that there is little incentive to do so if the results of the studies are not patentable. There are some treatments generally accepted in Western medicine to give a form of relief for the airways in case of cold or flu, such as mint and eucalyptus essential oils. Although there is little proof that aromatherapy can cure diseases, there is considerable anecdotal evidence of its benefits. The term \"aromatherapy\" has been applied to such a wide range of products that almost anything which contains essential oils is likely to be called an \"aromatherapy product\", rendering the term somewhat meaningless in that context. Some proponents of aromatherapy believe that the claimed effect of each type of oil is not caused by the chemicals in the oil interacting with the senses, but that the oil contains a distillation of the \"life force\" of the plant from which it is derived that will \"balance the energies\" of the body and promote healing or well-being by purging negative vibrations from the body's energy field. Arguing that there is little scientific evidence that healing can be achieved, or that the claimed \"energies\" even exist, many skeptics reject this form of aromatherapy as pseudoscience or even quackery This article is licensed under the [GNU Free Documentation License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).
