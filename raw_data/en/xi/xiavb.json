This would include being present at the musculoskeletal station at 8A.M, and throughout the work day, completion of dictation of all reviewed studies in a timely manner, attendance at all departmental teaching conferences, and grand rounds presentations. - Facilitate the learning of medical students, peers, other professionals participating in the musculoskeletal service including nurse practitioners, and physical therapy students. - Participate in bi-weekly inter-departmental teaching conference with rheumatology fellows, and weekly orthopedic department conference. - Build confidence in reading all musculoskeletal studies. - Contribute at least 2 cases per month to the Radiology Department Teaching File - Continue reviewing the ACR teaching file for musculoskeletal radiology The above rotational goals incorporate the core competencies as follows: Medical Knowledge - Goals 1,3,4,5,7, and 9 Interpersonal and Communication Skills - Goals 2, 6, 8, and 9 Practice Based Learning and Improvement - Goals 6 , 7, and 9 Professionalism - Goal 5 Patient Care - Goals 3,5, and 6 Systems Based Practice - Goal 9 Assessment tools utilized\u2014 Global ratings by faculty Conference attendance logs Multi-disciplinary conference attendance logs In-service examination Plan \u2014 Develop 360 degree evaluations Individuals to be included - technologists on day shift in radiology Knowledge Based Objectives Rotation 2 - All knowledge based objectives from rotation 1 - Infection - Concepts continued - Septic arthritis - Osteomyelitis - Terminology- sequestrum, involucrum, cloaca, - Sclerosing osteomyelitis of Garre - Organisms - bacterial - tuberculous - fungal - Joint Disorders - Normal anatomy - Types of joints - fibrous, cartilaginous, synovial - Intervertebral discs - Features to be evaluated for each disorder - Bone density - Soft tissue changes - Bone sclerosis, production, osteophyte formation / appearance - Bone erosions - Joint space - Alignment / deformity - Distribution - Specific arthropathies - Osteoarthritis - Primary - Secondary - Erosive - Inflammatory - Rheumatoid - Psoriatic - Reiter's - Ankylosing spondylitis - Enteropathic - Juvenile chronic - Connective tissue - SLE - Scleroderma - Depositional - Osteoarthritis - Neoplasms - Radiographic features - Single vs. multiple - Lytic, blastic, mixed - Zone of transition - Cortical destruction - Matrix - Periosteal response - Soft tissue mass - Features on advanced imaging modalities - Nuclear studies, CT, US, MRI - Osseous lesions - Chondroid lesions - Fibrous lesions - Vascular lesions - Associated syndromes - Primary vs. secondary lesions - Radiographic features - Infection - Metabolic / Hematologic Disorders - Skeletal Dysplasias - Syndromes Musculoskeletal Radiology Rotation 3 Goals - Demonstrate learning of the knowledge based objectives for rotation 1, 2, and 3. - Demonstrate increasing proficiency in ability to protocol CT studies to optimize examination to address clinical question posed. - Demonstrate ability to critically analyze reconstructed images for proper technique and plane of reconstruction. - Demonstrate initiative in correcting problems encountered in CT and MR imaging. (e.g. resident assesses whether all pulse sequences performed are filmed and intervenes prior to film review with attending so all performed studies can be reviewed. e.g. resident identifies improper technique for CT reconstructions and interacts with CT technologist to correct problem prior to film review with attending. - Demonstrate unders1anding of most frequently utilized pulse sequences for musculoskeletal MR imaging and utility of each. - Demonstrate ability to protocol and monitor MR examinations. - Demonstrate increased proficiency in the interpretation of musculoskeletal MR studies. - Demonstrate ability to evaluate patients for interventional procedures and obtain consent. Knowledge required includes appropriate indications, contraindications, objectives, alternatives, and possible complications. Pre- procedure assessment requires review of all prior imaging studies. Post- procedure assessment requires knowledge of proper treatment for all possible procedural complications. - Communicate effectively with referring clinicians - Including obtaining relevant history for study interpretation or for assessment for interventional procedure. - Regarding important findings on studies performed - Demonstrate responsible work ethic. This would include: - Being present at the musculoskeletal station at 8A.M, and throughout the work day, - Completion of dictation of all reviewed studies in a timely manner. - Demonstration of awareness of any scheduled interventional procedures for the musculoskeletal radiology service. - Attendance at all departmental teaching conferences, and grand rounds presentations. - Facilitate the learning of medical students, peers, other professionals participating in the musculoskeletal service including nurse practitioners, and physical therapy students. - Participate in bi-weekly inter-departmental teaching conference with Rheumatology fellows, and weekly orthopedic department conference. - Contribute at least 2 cases per month to the Radiology Department Teaching File. - Finish reviewing the ACR teaching file for musculoskeletal radiology The above rotational goals incorporate the core competencies as follows: Patient Care - Goals 3, 7, 8 Medical Knowledge - Goals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 Interpersonal and Communication Skills - Goals 7, 8, 10 Professionalism - 8,9 Practice Based Learning and Improvement - Goals 8, and 9, 10, 11 Systems Based Practice - Goal 7, 11 Assessment tools: Global faculty evaluations Departmental and inter-departmental conference attendance logs 360 degree evaluations Procedure logs ACR in-service examination Knowledge Based Objectives Rotation 3 All knowledge based objectives from rotations 1 and 2 to a greater depth.
