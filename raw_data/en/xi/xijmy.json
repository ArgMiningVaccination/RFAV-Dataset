I wouldn't like to get into the specifics of my current situation but I was wondering if anyone has family members who are very anti-science, into the supernatural etc. that eye you with a sense of mistrust because of your job or education? I'm almost certain some people in pharma must have had weird conversations with family or friends during the pandemic? It's a bit deflating when you can explain how something works or doesn't, and no matter what they refuse to believe you because they saw one thing on Facebook etc. "}
