Many people suspect that environmental exposures cause their health problems. According to some self-help groups, there are thousands of individuals in Switzerland who are affected by multiple chemical sensitivities or electromagnetic hypersensitivity. The number of people who believe that they are affected, and who will eventually seek medical help and/ or environ-mental counselling, could thus be an important factor in the availment of health care. Concerned persons generally either consult their general practitioner or environmental protection agencies responsible for chemical safety or air hygiene. However, both physicians and the environmental agencies are hindered by inadequate knowledge of each other's area of specialisation. Furthermore, it is well known that psychological factors can contribute to the development or maintenance of unspecific health complaints. A IM:To assess the need, the feasibility and the efficacy of environmental medicine counselling in Switzerland. To discuss the implications of the research results for the Swiss health care system. METHODS :Environmental medicine consultations in general practice were assessed with the help of nearly 250 physicians who participate in the \"Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network\". In 2002, the physicians were asked to record the number of patients who reported health problems attributed to environmental exposures. During 2001, persons who attributed their health problems to environmental exposures were counselled in an interdisciplinary environmental medicine pilot project. Sixty-three participants, living in the Basel area, had a medical and a psychological-psychiatric examination and were visited at home by an environmental hygienist. Electromagnetic field (EMF) measurements were conducted at the homes of 25 participants who attributed their Abstract 9health complaints specifically to EMF. The results of all the investigations were discussed in joint case conferences, and were followed by counselling of the participants. The project was evaluated approximately half a year after participation, using telephone interviews. R ESULTS :Environmental-exposure related consultations in general practice in Switzerland were rare; comprising 0.03 % of all consultations. The majority of participants in the environmental medicine project had sought help from a wide range of health care providers before enrolling in the study. Participants had also spent more money on health care not covered by health insurance than a representative (symptomatic) sample of the population. Presented problems were complex: The proportion of participants with psychological-psychiatric problems proved to be high; however 40 % of participants had a plausible theory for the environmental aetiology of at least one of their health problems. Overall, psychiatric diagnoses did not exclude environmentally caused symptoms and vice versa. The evaluation of the EMF-cases indicated that few persons were particularly susceptible to EMF. Legal threshold values for EMF were not exceeded in any of the homes. More than a third of the participants reported that they benefited from the project and their long lasting health problems improved following participation. C ONCLUSIONS :The results of the environmental medicine project strongly suggest that only an interdisciplinary structure including medical, psychologic-psychiatric and environmental expertise is likely to be able to adequately diagnose environmental related health problems and provide suitable advice to persons who attribute health complaints to environmental exposures. Although the proportion of the population affected is low, those affected cannot obtain adequate advice from existing health care structures. The implementation of an environmental medicine counselling service in the Basel area is currently under discussion (April 2004).

Acknowledgements 12Introduction and background 131Introduction and Background 1.1 Environmental medicine: open issues The diversity of indoor environmental exposures has increased in past decades. In addition, the improved sealing of the buildings in order to minimise energy loss can lead to an accumulation of indoor pollutants (Waeber et al. 1997). At the same time, adverse effects of the environment on human health have become a major concern of the scientific community and the general public. Though adverse health effects may be caused by many environ-mental, and occupational exposures (see e.g. WHO air quality guidelines or SUVA: Grenzwerte am Arbeitsplatz), significant gaps in our knowledge remain with respect to health effects from low dose environmental exposures encountered in everyday life (see e.g. Fairhurst 2003; Feron et al. 2002; Calabrese 2002). The widespread use of mobile (cellular) phones worldwide in recent years has lead to an increased interest in potential health risks of high frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF). Although there is a vast body of material on the possible biological effects from these fields, risk assessment is still limited (Ahlbom et a. 2001, Litvak et al. 2002, Levallois 2002, Repacholi 1998, R\u00f6\u00f6sli et al. 2003). In Switzerland, the proportion of people with health complaints attributed to environmental exposures is unknown. Nevertheless, data exist, suggesting that these health complaints are important issues for the health sector. For example, Swiss online self-help-pages for multiple chemical sensitivities groups (www.mcs-liga.ch) or for persons who attribute their health pro- blems to electromagnetic fields (EMF) (www.gigaherz.ch) report that there are thousands of affected individuals. Cross-sectional studies conducted in the USA reported that 3.9 % of the population in California had daily symptoms of chemical sensitivity (Kreutzer et al. 1999) and in North Carolina, 6.3 % of the population reported doctor-diagnosed 'environmental illness' or MCS (Meggs et al. 1996). Introduction and background 14Aproportion of all affected persons will eventually seek help for their health complaints (see Figure 1). Although this information is important to health service planners, no surveys have been conducted within the general population that attempt to estimate the number of people who will need help. Figure 1: Pyramid of increasingly severe potential health effects from environmental exposures To estimate the magnitude of environmental medicine counselling in general practice, a questionnaire survey was conducted in 2002 in collaboration with the 'Swiss Sentinel Sur-veillance Network'; a representative sample of physicians who report regularly on infectious diseases to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. In addition, data collected of consultations over the period of one year from several Swiss environmental agencies was obtained. Health sectors in many European countries and in the US and Canada have responded to a perceived need of environmental medicine counselling by expanding occupational health services to include environmental medicine centres (Ahlborg 2000; Sabo et al. 2000) and by establishing outpatient clinics for environmental medicine (Seidel 2002). No such service exists within the health sector in Switzerland. People complaining about symptoms that they attribute to the environment either consult their general practitioner or environmental protection agencies responsible for chemical safety or air hygiene. However, both the Introduction and background 15physicians and the environmental agencies are hindered by the inadequate knowledge of each other's area of specialisation. Furthermore, it is well known that psychological factors can contribute to the development or maintenance of unspecific health complaints (Uexk\u00fcll 1997). To evaluate the need and the feasibility of an interdisciplinary service for environmental medicine, a research project was initiated in January 2001 at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Cooperation agencies included several university institutes, regional and local environmental agencies and the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. The project was a continuation of an already existing ad hoc cooperation between these agencies. During a pilot project, restricted to a one year period, an interdisciplinary team systematically assessed the medical, psychological-psychiatric and environmental background of persons who attributed their health problems to environmental exposures and, subsequently, offered advice to the participants. An evaluation interview assessed participants' health status and satisfaction with the project approximately half a year after counselling. This thesis focuses on the need for environmental medicine consultations in Switzerland. In a second step, characteristics of persons who attribute health complaints to environmental exposures are compared to a representative (symptomatic) sample of the Swiss population. Results of the medical, psychological-psychiatric and environmental assessments are analysed. In a subsample of project participants who attributed their health complaints to EMF, EMF-exposures are put into context with systematically conducted examinations and are discussed critically against the background of incongruities of the existing Swiss legal threshold values. Finally, the project evaluation is presented and conclusions are drawn for the health care system in Switzerland. Objectives and structure of this thesis 161.2 Objectives and structure of this thesis 1.2.1 Goal of the environmental medicine project Goal of the environmental medicine project was to develop a model of an environmental medicine counselling structure and to test its implementation in a pilot project, including the analysis of the results and the evaluation of the project. Another goal was to assess the magnitude of environmental medicine consultations in general practice in Switzerland. 1.2.2 Main objectives of this thesis and used methods In the following, the specific research questions are introduced, the means by which the questions were answered and the chapters where they are addressed. Asummary of the findings is presented in chapter 5.1. I) What is the magnitude of environmental medicine counselling in general practice in Switzerland? During 2002, the nearly 250 physicians who participate in the 'Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network', were asked to record the number of patients with environmental health problems, using a specific questionnaire. In addition, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health provided data of weekly consultation numbers of all Sentinella physicians as well as data from consultations of several local and national environmental agencies or private laboratories. In chapter 2.1, results of this survey are presented and put into context with data from the environmental medicine counselling project in Basel. II) What are characteristics of the environmental medicine project participants (e.g. attitude towards stress, use of 'alternative' health care services, reported illnesses), compared to a representative (symptomatic) sample of the Swiss population? The environmental medicine project counselled people who related their health pro-Introduction and background 17blems to environmental exposures. All participants filled in an entry questionnaire. For reasons of comparability, this questionnaire included questions from the Swiss Health Survey (1997) (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik 2000). In chapter 3.1 entry questionnaire items are compared to identical questions of the Swiss Health Survey from 1997 with emphasis on a \"symptomatic\" comparison group (persons who indicated having \"physical or psychological problems that restricted them in everyday activities, lasting for more than one year\", ~17 % of the survey). IIIa) What are the main findings of the medical, psychological-psychiatric and environmental assessments? IIIb) How do health complaints and suspected exposures correspond to the findings of the medical, psychological-psychiatric and environmental assessments? The standard assessment included three investigations: The medical examination emphasised on allergology and internal medicine. The psychological-psychiatric examination included two types of clinical interviews: a partially structured interview to assess conflicts and personality structure was followed by a computer-structured interview to determine the subject's diagnosis according to ICD-10. In addition, participants were instructed to fill in psychometric questionnaires. The environmental investigation by the environmental hygienist included a home visit as well as standard measurements of indoor climate parameters. All results were discussed in joint case conferences. In chapter 3.1, the results of the three assessments as recorded in the joint case conferences are presented, as well as the plausibility of the findings' context with the reported health complaints. IVa) What EMF exposure level can be found in the subgroup of participants who attributed their health complaints to electromagnetic fields? Introduction and background 18IVb) How can the results of the measurements be evaluated with respect to their health relevance? IVc) How do reported health complaints correspond to the findings of the electromagnetic field (EMF) measurements? In the subgroup of cases where participants suspected EMF as cause of the symptoms, in addition to the standard investigations, participants were visited by an expert who measured EMF-exposure at home. For the evaluation of the health relevance of the assessed electromagnetic fields, a set of criteria was developed. On the basis of the developed criteria, the findings of the EMF-assessments, the medical, psychological-psychiatric and (biological and chemical) environmental investigations were rated with respect to their plausibility as a cause of the reported health complaints. All these results are presented in chapter 3.2. V) How do the complainants describe their health approximately half a year after participation in the environmental medicine project? How many were successful in the implementation of given advice, and were the expectations into the project fulfilled? After the case conferences, the project participants were counselled, followed by an evaluation interview approximately half a year later. The questionnaire for this telephone interview focused on process-oriented questions (e.g. satisfaction with the duration of examinations) as well as result-oriented questions (e.g. changes in the health status after participation in the project). Chapter 4.1 gives a brief overview of the results of the interview.

In the present study weinvestigated the frequency of environmentallyrelated health problems amongst the patients ofSwiss sentinel physicians and assessed symptomsand suspected environmental exposures. Methods : During 2002, nearly 250 \"Swiss Sen- tinel Surveillance Network\" physicians were askedto record the number of patients presenting withenvironmental health problems and to complete aquestionnaire inquiring about suspected environ-mental exposures and health problems. Physiciansoffering \"alternative\" medical therapies also par-ticipated in the study. The results were comparedwith the experience of a Basel University pilot proj-ect which evaluated patients with environment-related health problems simultaneously from the medical, psychiatric and environmental view-point.Results: 354 environment-related consulta- tions were reported by 72 physicians, correspond-ing to 0.03% of all sentinel-physician consulta-tions. There were considerable differences bothwithin the group of Sentinella physicians, and be-tween physicians offering \"alternative\" medicaltherapies and the Sentinella physicians, in the fre-quency of environmentally-related consultations,the character of the reported symptoms and thesuspected environmental exposures. Conclusion : Overall, environmental medicine consultations in general practice were rare. How-ever, experience of the environmental medicinepilot project showed that concerned persons seek help from various health care providers andfrom environmental agencies. Effective treatmentshould include counselling by medical, psychiatricand environmental professionals. Key words: Sentinella; environmental medicine; counselling In Switzerland, the prevalence of persons with health problems attributed to environmental expo-sures is unknown. No peer-reviewed studies havebeen published, but according to some of the self-help pages for \"multiple chemical sensitivities\"(MCS) groups (www.mcs-liga.ch) or persons whoascribe their health problems to electromagneticfields (www.gigaherz.ch), for example, there arethousands of individuals in Switzerland who areconcerned. These figures suggest that health prob-lems due to environmental exposure are an impor-tant issue in the health sector. US studies havereported that 3.9% of the population in a cross-sec-tional study in California had daily symptoms of chemical sensitivity [1]. A study in North Carolinareported 6.3% of the population with doctor-diag-nosed \"environmental illness\" or \"MCS\" [2]. What do people do when they feel that their health problems are caused by environmental ex-posures? In contrast to other countries [3-5],Switzerland does not offer environmental medi-cine counselling within an institutional structure.While some people see their doctor about suchconditions, others may seek advice from an envi-ronmental agency, e.g. agencies responsible forchemical safety or air hygiene. Summary The environmental medicine project,No. HautAllergie, Bern, and the Baselresearch Introduction500 Original article SWISS MED Peer reviewed articleSWISS MED WKLY 2004;134:500-507 \u00b7 www.smw.ch 501 The first aim of this study was to estimate the scale of environmental medicine counselling inSwitzerland. For this estimation we had two different data sources. The main source was the frequency ofmedical consultations due to environmental expo-sures in general practice. In collaboration with the\"Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network\" (\"Senti-nella\"), physicians' case notifications for medicalproblems ascribed to environmental exposurewere recorded during one year. The need for en-vironmental medical advice was also assessed in aone-year environmental medicine pilot projectconducted at the University of Basel. This pilotproject evaluated patients who attributed their health problems on environmental exposure usingmedical, psychological and environmental tools[6]. The results of this pilot project were added asa second information source. A second aim of the study was to analyse whether health problems and suspected environ-mental exposures differed between groups ofphysicians and the complainants of the environ-mental medicine pilot project. Finally, plausibility ratings concerning a causal relation between the symptoms and the suspectedexposures conducted by the physicians and theproject research team were compared. Methods Sentinel network: Assessment of consultations due to environment-related medical problems The Swiss \"Sentinella\" network is a joint project of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and the University ofBerne. 150-250 general practitioners (GPs), internists andpaediatricians in private practice have been reporting weeklymorbidity data since 1986. In 2002 the physicians taking partrepresented 3.37%, 2.76% and 6.25% respectively of allGPs, internists and paediatricians. These percentages referto practitioners aged less than 65 years. Nearly all Swiss Cantons are represented by at least one regularly reportingphysician (www.bag.admin.ch/sentinella/). The main re-porting topics are infectious influenza-likeillness, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, etc. Whereone patient has seen the doctor several times for the samehealth problem, only one consultation is recorded. Physi-cians record the number of consultations on a weekly basis. The Swiss sentinel physicians agreed to record the fre- quency of environmentally related problems during the year2002 on the official questionnaire of the Swiss Federal Of-fice of Public Health, and to supplement the informationrecorded with an additional environmental medicine ques-tionnaire. Data concerning the Swiss sentinel physicians (e.g. age, sex, region) was obtained from the Swiss Federal Office ofPublic Health. It has been suggested that people with environmental sensitivities use the health care system more often [7] and aremore likely to seek help outside the traditional medical sec-tor. We had found evidence of this in the Basel environmen-tal medicine pilot project [6], and therefore invited addi-tional general practitioners offering \"alternative\" therapeu-tic methods (e.g. homoeopathy) to participate in the presentstudy. Four out of ten physicians contacted agreed to partic-ipate. The main inclusion criterion for an environmental medical consultation was that either the patient or physicianor both suspected environmental exposures as the cause ofthe health problem. Environmental exposures perceived, butnot necessarily verified, as the cause of health problems, suchas food additives, electromagnetic fields or amalgam, wereincluded as environmental exposures. For brevity, we ex-cluded \"classic allergens\" such as animal dander, pollen,mites or medication from the list of environmental expo-sures. Additional environmental questionnaire In the environmental medicine questionnaire, physi- cians could tick up to 22 symptoms and 25 exposure items,or provide information in free text. Health problems wereclassified into nine groups: (a) unspecific symptoms, (b) gen- eral symptoms, (c) respiratory symptoms or irritations of eye,nose or throat, (d) cutaneous symptoms or allergies, (e) car-diac or circulatory problems, (f) gastrointestinal symptoms,(g) infections, (h) muscular or joint problems or rheumato-logical symptoms, or (i) \"other\". Environmental exposurewas divided into: indoor exposures, radiation (with the sub-group electromagnetic fields), outdoor exposures, noise,amalgam, food additives and \"other\". Further questions were included to gather demo- graphic data and information on the duration of symptoms.Physicians were asked to indicate whether a causal relation-ship between the reported illness and the suspected exposureseemed \"unlikely\", \"possible\" or \"likely\". Information on thepatient's treatment (counselling, therapy, provision of fur-ther information from environmental agencies, etc) was as-sessed. Data analysis T o estimate the scale of environmental medical prob- lems, we assessed the number of environment-related casenotifications as a percentage of all consultations, the analy-ses being confined to physicians who reported the total num-ber of consultations per week. As a next step, patients' demographic data, health prob- lems and suspected exposures were compared. Group differences were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis or chi 2test. The prevalence of reported symptoms and suspected exposurewas calculated from proportions of ticked items within thesymptom or exposure categories. Mantel-Haenzel odds ra-tios were calculated for the reported symptom and exposuregroups, where patients reported at least one item of the re-spective groups. Physicians reporting cases were compared with physi- cians who reported no cases with respect to demographicdata, region and type of area, using Fisher's exact, chi 2or Wilcoxon tests. The mean number of cases per physician andyear was compared between specialties, region and type ofarea using the Kruskal-Wallis test. T o estimate the prevalence of annual environment-re- lated medical consultations in Switzerland we assessed theproportion of each physician's environment-related consul-tations. We averaged these estimates across physicians in theseparate specialities and weighted them using the meannumber of consultations (per physician and year) within thespeciality as well as the number of physicians in the special-ity in Switzerland. Finally, the physicians' assessment of thecausality rating of health symptoms and environmental ex-posure are presented. All calculations were performed usingS TATA 8.Environmental medicine 502 Frequency of environment-related medical problems Of the 223 sentinel physicians who reported consultation numbers (92% of all Sentinella physi-cians), 64 (29%) reported at least one environ-ment-related case in a one-year period. One of the four \"alternative\" physicians did not report weekly consultations, and thus a total of226 physicians reported total physician-patientencounters, amounting to nearly a million. Thesephysicians reported a total of 331 environment-re-lated consultations, representing 0.03% of all con-sultations. Among the \"alternative\" physicians theproportion was 0.29% (28/9660 consultations).One of the sentinel reported cases,a of 4.2% (158/3727 consultations, \"fre-quently reporting physician\"). The proportionamong the rest of the sentinel physicians who re-ported environment-related cases was 0.054%. During the year 2002, 63 persons participated in the Basel environmental medicine pilot project[8] serving a target population of some 450,000residents (consultation frequency approx.0.014%). Characteristics of physicians reporting cases Of all the physicians who reported patients with environment-related medical problems, 98%returned a questionnaire. Of a total of 354 ques-tionnaires returned, 315 (89%) were sent back bythe sentinel physicians and 39 (11%) by the \"alter-native\" physicians. The median age of physicians reporting cases was the same as that of non-reporting physicians(50 years, p = 0.8). The percentage of female physi-cians was 13% vs. 18 % (p = 0.3). T able 1 shows the percentage distribution of reporting physiciansbetween specialities, Swiss regions and type of re-gion. Except for GPs, who reported cases signifi-cantly more often than physicians in the other spe-cialities (p = 0.01), none of these factors differ to astatistically significant degree. The mean numberof cases per physician and year within a speciality,region or type of area also differs significantly onlyby the physician's specialisation (p = 0.005). Characteristics of patients with environment-related problems T able 2 compares patients' demographic data, reported symptoms and suspected types of expo-sure between the sentinel physicians, the \"alterna-tive\" physicians and the environmental medicinepilot project. The frequently reporting sentinelphysician is considered separately from the rest ofthe sentinel physicians. The sex distribution of thepatients differed slightly between the four groups(p = 0.1), with more women in the \"alternative\"physicians group. Among patients over 18, par-ticipants in the environmental medicine projectwere significantly older than the rest (group differ-ence p = 0.0003) and youngest in the \"frequentlyreporting physician\" group. Patients of the \"alter-native\" physician group reported significantlymore symptoms (3.6 per patient) than patients of the other two physician groups (2.4 sentinel, 2.6 \"alternative\" physician patients). Participantsin the environmental medicine project reported3.2 symptoms per participant (group difference p = 0.0001).

Respiratory problems (especially cough) and irritation of eyes, nose and throat were the mostcommon symptoms among the patients of the sen-tinel physicians and the environmental medicineproject. Patients of the \"alternative\" GPs reportedgeneral symptoms as the most prevalent, especiallyfatigue, which was reported by more than half. Thepatients of the \"frequently reporting physician\"group complained most often of fatigue andheadache. Participants in the environmental med-icine project tended to suspect more environmen-tal exposures as the cause of their health problemsthan the other physicians' patients (see table 3).The least number of environmental exposures perpatient was suspected by patients of the \"fre- quently reporting physician\". Exposure to an out-door source, in particular ozone and particulatematter, but also electromagnetic fields, was mostoften suspected of causing health problems in thesentinel physicians' patient group. Patients of the\"alternative\" physicians reported indoor and out-door exposure forms and amalgam in about equalproportions.

Amalgam was suspectedof rheumatological and muscular, generalor unspecific symptoms. Radiation exposure (usu-ally electromagnetic fields) was usually matchedwith cardiac/ circulatory problems, unspecific orgeneral symptoms . T able 3 shows how often the environmental problem was the main reason for consultations,whether the physician and/or the patient suspectedthe environmental exposure to be related to the pa-tient's symptoms, and what was the physicians' rat-ing of the likelihood of a causal relation betweenthe suspected environmental exposure and thehealth problem. For nearly half the \"alternative\" physicians' patients, some 60% of the Sentinella physicians'patients and practically all those of the \"frequentlyreporting physician\", environmental problemswere the main motive for the consultation. In the Sentinella physicians' group environ- mental exposures were suspected by either the pa-tient or both physician and patient, whereas among\"alternative\" physicians either the physician or thepatient suspected the environmental exposure tobe related to the health problem. The \"frequentlyreporting physician\" and his patients usually agreed on the suspected exposure. The \"sentinel\" physicians were most sceptical about a causal relationship between environmen-tal exposure and the health problem. \"Alternative\"physicians and the \"frequently reporting physi-cian\" were more inclined to rate environmentalexposure as the likely cause of the patient's symp-toms. Sentinella physicians rated ozone, traffic ex- haust and particulate matter a \"likely\" cause ofhealth problems, whereas electromagnetic fields,indoor exposure to e.g. paint, varnish or solventsand amalgam were more often rated unlikely.These ratings were not affected by the Sentinellaphysicians' demographic characteristics. The \"alternative\" physicians indentified most often amalgam, ozone and insecticides as the\"likely\" cause. The \"frequently reporting physi-cian\" suspected amalgam to be a likely or possiblecause for 95% of the patients who consulted himfor environment-related symptoms. In only 11 cases (3%) did the physicians indi- cate on the questionnaire that they needed furtherbackground information for adequate manage-ment of the patient. Seven of the Sentinella pa-tients and one patient of the \"alternative\" physi-cians were recommended to seek help from an en-vironmental agency. Discussion In our study, environment-related medical counselling in general practice was relatively rare,with some 70% of physicians reporting no caseduring the year. Physicians who offer \"alternative\"therapies reported more cases than most of theSentinella physicians. However, the ratio of envi-ronment-related consultations to all consultationswas not very high and exceeded 0.3%, or some 10patients per year, only once in our sample of nearly250 physicians. The four \"alternative\" physicians who partic- ipated in our sentinel study counselled approxi-mately 10 patients a year, which correspondsclosely to a German study reporting 11 environ-ment-related consultations per year in a group ofphysicians who expressed explicit interest in con-tributing to research in environmental medicine[9]. The \"alternative\" physicians in our study mayalso represent a sample of physicians interested inenvironmental medicine and thus be comparableto the German sample. 15 physicians in the Sen-tinella group, including the \"frequently reportingphysician\", reported training in homoeopathy ortraditional Chinese medicine (TCM). If the \"fre-quently reporting physician\" is excluded, these \"al-ternative\" sentinel physicians did not report morecases than the other Sentinella physicians. How-ever, we cannot assess whether we were able toidentify all \"alternative\" physicians in the Sen-tinella group. In addition, the sample is too small and the data are too heterogeneous to allow moregeneral conclusions on this group. A rate of 0.03% of all consultations seems low. However, when the case notifications of the 3.6%of family doctors participating in the Sentinellasystem are extrapolated to all GPs and internists inSwitzerland, the result would be 5707 (95% C.I.4260-7150) environment-related consultationswithin one year. This is a conservative estimatewhich excludes the \"frequently reporting physi-cian\", since it may have been pure chance to haveone physician in the group reporting so manycases. On the other hand, the \"frequently report-ing physician\" may represent a rare group of phy-sicians specialised for environmental medicineproblems. Including this physician in the estimateyields an additional 5812 cases per year. Moreover, there may be reasons for underre- porting. Among others, not all concerned personsnecessarily consult a GP , since they may suspectthe physician of lacking environmental back-ground knowledge. In the environmental medi-cine project only 69% of participants reportedhaving seen their GP . Some patients may turn toan environmental agency for advice. One may speculate that reporting of environ- ment-related cases is linked to the fact that specificphysicians are more aware of the problem and thusSWISS MED WKLY 2004;134:500-507 \u00b7 www.smw.ch 505 report cases more often. For example, older physi- cians may be less likely to consider environmentalexposures as causes of health problems than theiryounger colleagues. However, this is not sup-ported by our data. If GPs report more cases thismay be because they have different patients frominternists or paediatricians. Sentinella physicians tended to relate health problems to environmental exposures such as out-door air pollution, for which a context to respira-tory symptoms has been shown in a range of pub-lications [10-15]. Health effects from indoor pol-lution sources are more controversial, especially atlow levels, and have only been clearly demon-strated for some specific exposures (e.g. formalde-hyde). Health effects of electromagnetic fields oramalgam are even more contro versial. It may be speculated that the heterogeneity in the scientific community's and the media's discussion of causal-ity is mirrored in the physicians' reporting of en-vironmental cases in our study: Apparently the \"al-ternative\" physicians participating in our studywere less likely than the other physicians to rejecta connection between such environmental expo-sures and their putative adverse health effects. Thismay account for a larger number of reported casesand higher attendance by concerned persons insuch practices. Similarly, the environmental medicine project participants relied significantly more often onservices of the \"alternative\" health care sector thana representative symptomatic group in the Swisspopulation [6], an observation that has also beenreported in other studies [7]. The physicians participating in this study had to judge whether the relationship between the pa-tients' symptoms and environmental exposure wasprobably or possibly causal. Sentinella physicianswere more sceptical about a causal relationshipthan \"alternative\" physicians but they did notdiffer in their estimate of a \"possibly\" causal rela-tionship which they reported for more than 80%of their patients. In the Basel environmental med-icine project, where patients underwent a detailedmedical, psychological and environmental assess-ment, the interdisciplinary project team consid-ered the health symptoms of only 40% of the par- ticipants to be possibly linked to environmental ex-posure. 46% of the symptoms could be explainedby psychological-psychiatric factors alone [6]. Thehigh proportion of a possible causal relationshipestimated by the physicians in the present studymay reflect physicians' preferentially reporting an\"environmental medicine case\" when they con-sider the association to be real. This would, on theother hand, imply that only those cases were re-ported. The prevalence of environmentally-related medical consultations in general practice is ratherlow. However, experience of the Basel pilot proj-ect suggests that many of these patients suffer fromlong-standing and complex health problems, needmuch consultation time, have sought help fromvarious health care providers, thus producing ad-ditional costs, and could, at least in part, profitfrom an interdisciplinary assessment of theirhealth problems [6, 8]. Successful implementationof the project team's recommendations was not re-stricted to participants whose symptoms wereplausibly related to environmental exposure [8] butalso included medical and psychiatric advice.Combining medical, psychiatric and environmen-tal expertise to provide a structured intervention inthe health sector would offer the best means ofeffectively counselling and treating patients withenvironmentally-related diseases.

In 40% of theparticipants the research team rated the association between an environmental exposure andthe health complaints to be `plausible'. Psychiatric disorders were frequent, but did notexclude environmentally caused symptoms.Conclusion: Only an interdisciplinary structure including medical, psychiatric and environ-mental expertise is likely to adequately diagnose and advise persons with environmentallyrelated symptoms. Key words: Environmental medicine counselling /C73/C110/C116/C114/C111/C100/C117/C99/C116/C105/C111/C110 Over the last decade, adverse effects of the environ- mentonhumanhealthhavebecomeamajorconcernboth for the scientific community and the generalpublic. Though adverse health effects have beenshown for many environmental and occupationalexposures, there remain significant knowledge gapswith respect to health effects of low dose environ- mental exposures encountered in everyday life.Nevertheless, many people suspect environmental exposures cause their health problems. Although the reported prevalence of symptoms caused by envi-ronmental exposures vary widely (Meggs et al.1996; Kreutzer et al. 1999; Sabo et al. 2000), healthsectors in many European countries and in the USand Canada have responded to a perceived need byexpanding occupational health services to includeenvironmental medicine centres (Ahlborg 2000; Sabo et al. 2000) and by establishing outpatient 1438-4639/04/207/03-245 $ 30.00/0clinics for environmental medicine (Beyer and Eis 1994; Eis et al. 1995; Seidel 2002). In Switzerland, no such services exist within the health sector. People complaining about symptomsattributed to the environment either consult theirgeneral practitioner or environmental protectionagencies,e.g.servicesresponsibleforchemicalsafety or air hygiene. However, both the physicians and the environmental agencies are hindered by the lack ofthe specific knowledge of each other's sector.Furthermore, it is well known that psychologicalfactors can contribute to the development or main-tenance of unspecific health complaints (Eberlein-Knig et al. 2002; Escobar et al. 2002). Biological, psychological and sociological factors determine the development of symptoms in individ- uals, as has been conceptualised in the biopsycho-social model (Uexk\u00b8ll 1997). Thus, symptom re-porting is seen as the outcome of complex interac-tions between these factors (Spurgeon 2002), whichare probably active in all individuals at all times(Kipen and Fiedler 2002). Following this concept,adequate assessment of health complaints attributed to the environment has to include medical, psycho- logical and environmental investigations with asubsequent interdisciplinary exchange of informa-tion and findings. With this background an interdisciplinary envi- ronmental medicine research project was started inJanuary2001attheUniversityofBasel,Switzerland. As a pilot project restricted to a one year period, an interdisciplinary team systematically assessed themedical, psychological and environmental back-ground of people who related their health problemsto environmental exposures and, subsequently,offered advice to the participants. The aim of thepresentstudywas(1)toevaluatethosewhoseekhelp in suchaproject andto comparethe participantstoarepresentative sample of the Swiss population, (2) tosimultaneously assess the plausibility of the healthcomplaints from a medical, psychiatric and envi-ronmental perspective and (3) to evaluate theplausibility of the participants' individual theory of a causal relationship between exposure and health impairment. /C77/C101/C116/C104/C111/C100/C115 Over the year 2001, information about the project was sent twice to all physicians in the canton Basel-Landschaft (630) and to all physicians in Basel-Stadt, whose addressescould be extracted from the electronic phone book (650).Additionally all public environmental agencies or labora-tories and all private environmental agencies whoseaddresses were listed in the phone book (20), as well asseveralotherprivateorpublicoffices(111)wereinformed.Duringtheyear2001tenarticlesdescribing thestudyweredisseminated to the regional and local media. People interested in participation contacted the project coordinator directly by telephone or were given thecoordinator's telephone number by their physician orone of the environmental offices or information centres.Potential participants were required to report healthcomplaints which they related to some sort of (non-occupational) environmental exposure and to have resi-dency in the area of Basel (cantons Basel-Stadt, Basel- Landschaft)tobeincludedintotheproject. Thesecriteria applied to 95 of 136 persons who got into contact with theproject. As illustrated in Figure 1, all participants in the study completed an entry questionnaire before taking part in amedical, a psychological-psychiatric examination and an /C70/C105/C103/C46 /C49/C46Organisation of the environmental medicine investigations246 A. Huss et al.environmental investigation. The results of the three investigations were discussed in case conferences thatwere held for each participant, where all findings,diagnoses and conclusions were recorded. Finally, coun-selling was offered to the participants. Sixtythree personsattended all investigations and the non-participants wereinterviewed by telephone about their reasons for non-participation. The project was approved by the ethics committee of Basel and all participants gave written, informed consent. /C69/C110/C116/C114/C121 /C113/C117/C101/C115/C116/C105/C111/C110/C110/C97/C105/C114/C101 Every person meeting the entry criteria and willing to participateenteredthestudyasoneofthecases.Wehadnotrue controls, but were able to compare some character-istics of our study group to a representative Swiss sampleby including questions from the Swiss health survey (SHS)(Bundesamt f\u00b8r Statistik 2000) into the entry question-naire. The questionnaire was developed for this study,based on existing Swiss questionnaires and in collabora-tion with a German multicentre study (Eis et al. 2003).The SHS is based on a representative sample of 13,004personslivinginSwitzerlandandcovers anagerangeof15to 97 years. Questions taken from the SHS asked for demographics (age, gender, education), quality of sleep (with questions regarding: difficulties falling asleep, rest-less sleep, waking up repeatedly at night and waking uptoo early in the mornings; response categories were:`never', `seldom', `sometimes' or `often'), and the use ofalternative health care services (e.g. homeopathy) in thelast 12 month. As all participants of the environmentalmedicine project suffered (by definition) health problems,they were compared to a `symptomatic' subgroup of theSHS comprising 2229 persons who indicated having had`physical or psychic problems that restricted them ineveryday activities, lasting for more than one year'(/C2417% of all SHS-participants). /C77/C101/C100/C105/C99/C97/C108/C44 /C112/C115/C121/C99/C104/C105/C97/C116/C114/C105/C99 /C97/C110/C100 /C101/C110/C118/C105/C114/C111/C110/C109/C101/C110/C116/C97/C108 /C105/C110/C118/C101/C115/C116/C105/C103/C97/C116/C105/C111/C110/C115 The medical examination was performed by a physician in the University Hospital of Basel and included a physical examination, standard laboratory tests (blood formula, blood chemistry, total IgE, etc.) as well as anallergologicalscreening with prick tests of 25 inhalant and six foodallergens and patch tests of the European standard series.In addition, all participants underwent spirometry. Fur-ther tests were performed if necessary. The psychological-psychiatric examination included a partially structured interview `OPD' (OperationalisedPsychodynamic Interview) that was conducted to assessconflicts and personality structure and a standardisedcomputer-structured interview `M-CIDI' (Munich Com-posite International Diagnostic Interview) to determinethe subject's diagnosis according to ICD-10. The inter-views were carried out by a psychologist of the PsychiatricUniversity Hospital Basel. Participants were instructed tocomplete ten psychometric questionnaires: e.g. the Symp- tom Check List (SCL-90-R) and the Screening for Somato-form Disorders (SOMS-2J). Psychiatric diagnoses weremade from the M-CIDI interview, the clinical observa-tions and the SOMS-2J questionnaire. The diagnoses werediscussed in case conferences and, in cases of doubt,defined more precisely, altered into a secondary diagnosisor dropped. All participants were visited at home by the correspond- ing local environmental agency in order to register potential environmental exposures. The home visitswere conducted following an adapted version of a check-list published by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health(Binz-Deplazes and Stammbach 1998). The aim of thevisits were to give a detailed description of materialsurroundings at home (e.g. type of renovations, type ofbuilding materials), living habits (e.g. pets at home,smoking) and environmental factors in the surrounding(e.g. emissions from industry, traffic noise). Standardmeasurements of carbon dioxide, relative humidity androom-temperature werecarriedoutover2 \u00b1 3days,aswellas additional measurements (18 cases) of exposures suchas formaldehyde or radon if indicated. Low-frequencyelectric and magnetic and high-frequency electromagneticfields (EMF) were determined by an expert if participantsattributed their health problem specifically to EMF (25 cases). EMF were always measured on the bed and usually in the living room, the kitchen and in additional roomsdepending on duration of stay in the respective rooms andthe concerns of /C101/C97/C99/C104 /C115/C121/C109/C112/C116/C111/C109 In the case conferences, the findings of the medical, psychological and environmental examinations were pre-sented to the research team and each specialist rated theaetiological plausibility of a given complaint from his orher perspective. Plausibility from a medical perspectivewasbasedonthemedicalhistory oftheparticipantandthefindings from the medical examinations. Plausibility from a psychiatric perspective was based on the results of the psychiatric and psychodynamic explora-tion, on the scientific knowledge about symptomatology in psychic disease and on the diagnosis of psychosocial stress preceding the onset of symptoms. The plausibility from an environmental perspective was based on literature reports of given exposures, even iftoxicological levels of exposure were not attained, and onthe existence of a time and spatial context between a givenenvironmental exposure and the health problem, with theprerequisite that the exposure occurred before the onset ofsymptoms. In addition to these criteria, in the case ofelectromagnetic fields, measurements had to be at least inthe range of one tenth of the Swiss threshold values (lowfrequency magnetic field: 1 /C109T, high frequency: 4 \u00b1 6 V/m) tobeconsidered inthecaseconference.Forhighfrequencyfields, this value has been discussed in the Salzburgprecautionary guidelines (Altpeter et al. 2000). TheSymptoms attributed to the environment 247exposure had to occur in an area where the respective person spent several hours or more each day. Taking the information of all disciplines together, the team agreed on a final plausibility rating for eachsymptom from a medical, psychological and environ-mental perspective. The plausibility was rated on a scale,ranging from `not plausible' or `plausible' (3 \u00b1 5) rating. A given symptom could have plausible explanations from several perspectives and had thus `multiple plausibilities'. As many patientssuspected environmental exposures to be related to all oftheir symptoms, the `plausibility' rating had to be done foreachexposureandeachsymptomseparately.Forexample,we rated a persons fidgetiness or nervousness plausiblyexplained by1.6to 3 V/mhigh-frequency electromagneticfields \u00b1 when being in the kitchen where the exposureoccurred. On the other hand, we could not explain theparticipant's kidney problems with EMF, but with amedical condition instead. /C82/C101/C45/C82/C97/C116/C105/C110/C103 To check for the internal consistency of the plausibilityratings, six (10%) cases were randomly chosen for re-rating. About 6\u00b1 12 month later, the same team rated 14reported symptoms and the participants' suggested envi-ronmental aetiology of symptoms for a second time. /C69/C110/C118/C105/C114/C111/C110/C109/C101/C110/C116/C97/C108 /C97/C101/C116/C105/C111/C108/C111/C103/C121 /C111/C102 /C99/C111/C109/C112/C108/C97/C105/C110/C116/C115 During the case conference, the team also rated theparticipants' individual theory of a causal relationship between exposure and health impairment on the 1 \u00b1 5 plausibility scale. An environmental origin of healthproblems was also considered `plausible' if the environ-mental exposure was a trigger of the given health complaints. /C83/C116/C97/C116/C105/C115/C116/C105/C99/C97/C108 /C97/C110/C97/C108/C121/C115/C105/C115 Comparison between the study population and the SwissHealth Survey (Table 1) was conducted using logisticregression models and were expressed as age-, sex- andeducation-adjusted prevalence rates. P-values of group differences were determined with the likelihood-ratio test. Age and educational level was compared using the two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. A chi 2-test was used to assess gender differences. For the analyses of the environmental aetiology of health complaints (Table 2), the detailed 5-point plausi-bility rating was reduced to a binary variable `plausible' or`not plausible', and participants with and without plau-sible environmental aetiologies were compared to eachother. In these analyses, age and the number of symptomsor suspected exposures was compared using the two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. All other binary variableswere compared using the Chi 2or the Fisher's exact test. Analysis of the re-rating was carried out using the Cohen'sKappa interrater agreement coefficient to assess theagreement between the two ratings of the symptoms.

Environmental agencies(36%) and the media (32%) were most commonly named as source of information. Seventeen subjects (18%) were referred by their physician. Sixty-eight(72%) persons returned the entry-questionnaire and63 (66%) persons completed all three examinations. Of the 32 non-participants, 28 could be contacted by phone and indicated the following reasons fornon-participation: lack of time (9), no specificexplanation (6), rethinking of the problem yielded othercausethanthe environment (5),project didnotcomply with expectations (2), no psychiatric inter- view desired (1), no more medical examinationsdesired (1), feeling too ill to undergo further medicalexaminations (1), another solution of the problemwas found (1), partner participating already in project (1) or registration occurred after the end of the project (1). The mean age of the participants was 54 years, ranging from 24 \u00b184 years and 60% were female asshown in Table 1. The participants reported 202complaints, 24 (38%) participants reported one ortwo symptoms, 23 (37%) three or four symptomsand 16 (25%) five or more symptoms each.

The second and third largest groups were thegroup of the `unspecific symptoms' (23%) like sleepdisorders, fatigue or nervousness and the `generalsymptoms' (16%) such as headache, dizziness orpain. There were 132 different exposures suspected as cause of the health complaints. Biological or chemi-cal exposures from indoor sources (36%) were themost common. These included formaldehyde,mould, components of cleaning agents or construc-tion materials. The second largest group wereelectromagnetic fields (EMF) (19%). Only two complainants declared (multiple chemical sensitiv- ities). /C69/C110/C116/C114/C121 /C113/C117/C101/C115/C116/C105/C111/C110/C110/C97/C105/C114/C101 Participants in the environmental medicine project (EMP) had about the same age as the symptomaticsubgroup (SyS) of the Swiss Health Survey (53 years) as shown in . Sex distribution was similar in both studies.Theeducationallevelmeasuredinthesurveyof the EMP participants was significantly higherthan that of the SyS participants. In the analyses of the SHS, sleep disturbances were classified as `severe' when any of the questionsregarding quality of sleep were answered with `often' and as `pathological' when both waking up repeatedlyatnightandrestlesssleepoccurred`often'(Bundesamt f\u00b8r Statistik 2000). A significantlyhigher proportion of EMP-participants reportedsuffering from severe and pathological sleep dis-turbances than the SyS group. The use of `alterna-tive' medical services like acupuncture, homeop-athy, etc. was more popular among the EMP participants group than among the SyS group. /C77/C101/C100/C105/C99/C97/C108/C44 /C112/C115/C121/C99/C104/C105/C97/C116/C114/C105/C99 /C97/C110/C100 /C101/C110/C118/C105/C114/C111/C110/C109/C101/C110/C116/C97/C108 /C102/C105/C110/C100/C105/C110/C103/C115 The medical assessments yielded 145 medical diag- noses. The most frequently diagnosed were diseasesof the respiratory system and mucous membranes(30%of diagnoses) followedbydiagnosesofgeneral symptoms (such as headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal diseases (10%), skin (9%) andneurological diseases (7%). As subgroup, 12(19%) participants were diagnosed with asthma (J45). Twentyone of the participants (33%) had no psychiatric diagnosis. Among the 42 with a psychia- tric diagnosis were 19 persons (30%) with a personality disorder, 13 (21%) with a somatoformdisorder, 11 (18%) with a depressive disorder and 8 (13%)withananxietydisorder.Twentyparticipants(32%) had several diagnoses. Signs of dampness or mould were found in 12 (19%) homes. Ten (16%) homes were infrequentlyaired and consequently showed elevated CO 2levels (/C621000 ppm for several hours) especially at night. No chemicals with levels described in the literature as toxicologically relevant could be measured in anyof the homes. However, in five cases a relevantexposure could not be measured any more, but hadevidently occurred in the past. These includedpesticides (2), mixtures of diverse solvents (2) andoccupational related asbestos exposure (1). All EMFexposures were below the Swiss threshold values. Nevertheless, 12 persons had a high-frequency exposure that was measured on a level between 0.6and 2.95 V/m. Low-frequency magnetic fields wereabove 0.1 /C109T (maximum 1.3 /C109T) in 13 cases, in five homes both measures were elevated. In 10 homes (16%), the environmental investiga- tion yielded no indication of abnormal environ-mental exposures. /C73/C110/C116/C101/C114/C100/C105/C115/C99/C105/C112/C108/C105/C110/C97/C114/C121/C97/C115/C115/C101/C115/C115/C109/C101/C110/C116/C111/C102/C115/C121/C109/C112/C116/C111/C109/C112/C108/C97/C117/C115/C105/C98/C105/C108/C105/C116/C121 The simultaneous assessment of the symptom plau- sibility showed that of the reported 202 symptoms, 69 (34%) were related to medical findings, 131 (65%) to psychological-psychiatric findings and 49(24%) to environmental exposures ( 3). The sum-mation of symptom plausibility was greater than100% because 28% of the symptoms were judged tohave multiple plausibilities. At least one multipleplausible symptom occurred in 32 of the 63 parti- cipants (51%). Between the or `multiple' plausibility dif-fered considerably, as shown in Figure 2. Symptoms plausibly explained by environmental exposuresOn the basis of an existing allergic disease orbronchial asthma the following symptoms wereconsidered to be plausibly triggered by environ-mentalexposures:difficultiesinbreathing(8),cough(3), burning eyes (2), sensation of thoracic pressure (1), sore throat (1), running nose (2), sneezing (2). The respective exposure triggering the symptomswere: traffic exhaust, mould, allergens and chemicalssuch as environmental tobacco smoke, perfume, etc. Low-and high- frequency electromagnetic fields above a tenth of the Swiss threshold of 1 /C109T for low frequency magnetic fields and 4\u00b16 V/m for highfrequency were plausibly related to the following symptoms: sleeping problems (5), fatigue (2), head-250 A. Huss et al.ache (2), palpitations (1), nervousness (2), sensation of formication (1), feeling of heat and pressure in thehead (1). Noise exposure and elevated carbondioxide levels in the bedroom as a result of insufficient ventilation because of outside noise were considered to be plausibly related to sleepingproblems (2), headache (1) and fatigue (1), as wasformaldehyde expose as an explanation of burningeyes (2) and running nose (2). One patient had adocumented occupational asbestos exposure whichwas plausibly related to his higher susceptibility toinfections, cough and an overall decreased health status.Kappa coefficients of the re-rated symptoms ranked between /C107/C1360.3 \u00b10.4 when the five point plausibility scale was considered. However, whenthe rating was dichotomised into the binary variable `plausible' or `implausible', kappa coefficients showed almost perfect agreement with respect tothe medical evaluation ( /C107/C1360.9), substantial agree- ment for the environmental ratings ( /C107/C1360.8), and moderate agreement for the assessments of thepsychological part ( /C107/C1360.5). The variation in the psychological rating did not exceed two points onthe detailed scale and the rating differences did not reveal any time pattern or systematical difference/C84/C97/C98/C108/C101/C51/C46 6.4% 6 9.5% andmultiple plausibility of health complaints by symptom groupSymptoms attributed to the environment 251between first and second rating, or divergence only in low, middle or high category. The re-rating of the plausibility of an environ- mental aetiology /C111/C102 /C104/C101/C97/C108/C116/C104 /C99/C111/C109/C112/C108/C97/C105/C110/C116/C115 Participants suspected a mean of 2.1 different sources of environmental exposures to be the causeof their health complaints. Altogether, 25 (40%) participants offered at least one plausible theory of an environmental aetiology of their symptoms, asshown in Table 2. Data of one person could not berated due to missing data of the workplace situation. Table 2 also shows the association between the environmental aetiology ratings of the researchteam, several demographic factors, the environ- mentalexposurethatwasoriginallysuspectedbythe participant to cause the health problems and themedical and psychiatric findings. In bivariate test-ing, environmental aetiology rated `plausible' or`implausible', was not related to the demographicfactors or the suspected exposures. Among themedical findings, respiratory symptoms and atopyhad a tendency to occur more often in the `plausible' group whereas persons with neurological symptoms were more likely to be found in the `implausible'group. A psychiatric diagnosis, specifically a personality disorder was the strongest predictor for an `implau-sible' rating of an environmental aetiology of a givensymptom. /C68/C105/C115/C99/C117/C115/C115/C105/C111/C110 Compared to a symptomatic subgroup out of arepresentative Swiss sample, project participantshad a higher level of education, had more sleepdisturbances and used alternative health care servi-ces more often. The symptoms listed by the complainants were quite similar to symptoms reported from otherenvironmental medicine projects and from subjects considered to suffer from `Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance', `Environmental Sensitivities' or al. 2001;Joffres et al. 2001; Eberlein-Knig et al. 2002), witha predominance of unspecific, general and respira- tory symptoms. There are, however, some differ- ences: as a symptom subgroup, sleep disorders seemto play a more important role in the present project with 38% of participants reporting sleeping com-plaints as compared to 9%\u00b118% in two Germanenvironmental medicine centres (Bornschein et al.2000; Brlsch et al. 2001). Compared to the symp-tomaticsubgroupoftheSwissHealthSurvey,projectparticipants reported significantly more often `se- vere' or `pathologic' sleeping problems. In public discussions sleep disorders are often associated withexposure to electromagnetic fields in Switzerland(Rsli et al. 2002), but not necessarily in othercountries(Levallois 2002).In ourproject 75%of theparticipants who complained about sleep disorderssuspected electromagnetic fields and/or noise to bethe cause of their health problems. Electromagnetic fields were the second largest group of suspected environmental exposures. This might be due to thehigh usage of cell phones in Switzerland and to thefact that it is a comparatively new technology withlittle consensus with respect to its effects on humanhealth. EMF currently attracts frequent attention ofthe media. Brlsch et al. (2001) showed for Aachen,that the origin of suspected environmental exposure varies with time and area. It has been postulated that people with medically unknown symptoms that cannot be classified usingcurrent medical classifications of disease turn toalternative health care services because they lackvalidationbytheirphysicians(Saboet al.2000).Theresults of the present study support the notion of a higher use of alternative health care services al- though we cannot determine the reason for thisbehaviour. The fact that many (60%) of the projectparticipants had tried at least one of the alternativehealth care services may, however, be interpreted asthe patients' desperate search for help in order toimprove their situation. Project participants were more likely to have a positive skin prick test (birch, grass pollen, house dust mite, cat and dog epithelia and the mouldAlternaria ) and to suffer from asthma than a representative sample of the Swiss population(38% versus 23%, and 19% versus 7%, respectively(W\u00b8thrich 2001)). Thirty percent of all symptoms could partially or exclusively be explained by an underlying medical diagnosis. Thus 70% of the symptoms were not medically explained which is higher than the pre-valence of 20 \u00b150% reported from studies investi-gating medically unexplained symptoms in differentsettings (Carson et al. 2000; Nimnuan et al. 2000;Feder et al. 2001; Maiden et al. 2003). However, 46% of all symptoms could be ex- plained by psychiatric factors alone, occurring in 59% of the participants. The prevalence of psychia-252 A. Huss et al.tric disorders in patients with symptoms attributed toenvironmentalexposuresvarieswidelydependingon the study population, sample size and applieddiagnostic methods (Bornschein et al. 2001). Arecent multi-centre study on multiple chemicalsensitivities in Germany found psychiatric or psy-chosomaticdisordersin55 \u00b175%oftheparticipants (Eis et al. 2003), a study on health disorders attributed to environmental factors reports 55%psychiatricmaindiagnoses(Wiesm\u00b8lleret al.2002).A British study on medically unexplained symptomsreported about 50% psychiatric morbidity amongtheir patients (Nimnuan et al. 2001). Psychiatricdisorders are also quite frequent in primary carepatients, estimates ranging between 25 \u00b135% (Ka- ton et al. 2001). Thus, the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders found in the present study isin line with previous findings of other study popula-tions that are looking at either medically unex-plained symptoms or symptoms attributed to theenvironment. It is, however, important to note thatin half of the patients the reported symptoms wereplausibly explained by concurrent findings from at least two disciplines underlining the importance of an interdisciplinary approach for diagnosis andcounselling in environmental medicine. All patients entering the project suspected an environmental exposure to cause their symptoms.We aimed at identifying factors predicting agree-ment between the expert and patient rating of plausible environmental causes for the health pro- blems. None of the demographic variables nor theduration of symptoms or the type of suspectedexposure were such factors. Only the group ofpatients with at least one psychiatric diagnosis wassignificantly less likely to be rated by the researchteam to have a plausible environmental exposurecausing the symptoms. On the other hand, 40% of the patients whose subjective theory of the environ- mental symptom aetiology was in agreement withthe expert's judgment also had a psychiatric diag-nosis. Thus, a psychiatric diagnosis does not exclude environmentally caused symptoms. In conclusion, the results of the present study strongly suggest that only an interdisciplinary struc- ture including medical, psychiatric and environ- mental expertise is likely to adequately diagnose andadvise persons with environmentally related symp-toms.

The following addendum to chapter 3.1 presents additional results of the comparison between environmental medicine pilot project participants and participants of the Swiss health survey. These entry questionnaire items could not be included in the paper due to length restrictions. The here included questions focus on medical treatment during the past year, expenses for health care in the previous four weeks that were not covered by the health insurance, annoyance by different environmental exposures at home as well as coping styles and perceived control. Additional questions taken from the Swiss Health Survey (SHS) Questions taken from the SHS asked about medical treatment during the past year, for a list of diseases, expenses for health care in the previous four weeks that were not covered by the health insurance, and annoyance by different environmental exposures at home. As coping styles play an important role in physical and psychological well-being, a short form of the CISS - Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations - (12 questions, details are given below) was included. 'Coping style' refers to a characteristic or typical manner of confronting a stressful situation and dealing with it (Endler et al. 1990). The questions differentiate between problem-focussed coping ('task oriented'), emotion-oriented coping and avoidance-oriented coping. The latter was further subdivided into 'social diversion' and 'distraction' coping strategies. The Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) had the following instructions: \"the following are ways people react to various difficult, stressful or upsetting situations. Please circle a number from 1 - 5 for each item\" (answering categories from 'not at all' to 'very much') (Endler et al. 1990) and included the questions \u007f task: determine a course of action and follow it; try to be organized so I can be on top of the situation; think about the event and learn from my mistakes, analyse the problem before reacting. Addendum to chapter 3.1 41\u007f emotion: get angry, feel anxious about not being able to cope, blame myself for not knowing what to do, wish that I could change what has happened or how I felt. \u007f avoidance: a) distraction: window shop; treat myself to a favourite food or snack b) social diversion: try to be with other people, visit a friend. As a further psychological attribute that had been shown to contribute to well-being (Bailis et al. 2001), perceived level of control was assessed by four questions. Statistical analysis Comparison of binary variables was done using logistic regression models in S TATA 7 and were expressed as age-, sex- and education-adjusted prevalence rates. P-values of group differences were determined with the likelihood-ratio test. The assessment of subjective perception of control and the three coping strategies ('avoidance-, task- or emotion-oriented coping) were based on four questions each. Participants rated each of the coping-items on a five-point scale ranging from (1) \"not at all\" to (5) \"very much\". The answers were summarised to a score ranging between 4 and 20. Task-, emotion- and avoidance-coping mean scores, adjusted for age, sex and education, were then determined. Avoidance-oriented coping was further subdivided into 'distraction-' or 'social diversion'-oriented coping strategies based on two questions each (resulting in scores ranging from 2 to 10 points). Adjusted mean scores of the environmental medicine project (EMP) participants were compared with the SHS participants and the symptomatic subgroup (SyS) of the SHS. Subjective perception of control resulted in a score ranging between 4 and 17 which was subdivided into three categories (analogous to the Swiss Health Survey) indicating a low (4 - 11 points), middle (12 - 14 points) or high (15 - 17 points) level of control. Adjusted prevalence rates for the three levels of control were calculated by means of polytomous logistic regression and were compared between the different groups. Addendum to chapter 3.1 42Results Table 1 shows that a significantly higher percentage of both the SyS and the EMP group were annoyed by most of the listed environmental disturbances at home than the SHS participants. The SyS and the EMP group only differed with respect to industrial noise.

Among the EMP participants, a higher proportion than both the SyS group and the SHS group had undergone a medical treatment because of chronic bronchitis or allergies. More EMP participants were treated for cancer than in the SHS group. During the past four weeks, a higher proportion of both the SyS and the EMP group had spent money on medical services that were not covered by the health insurance than the SHS group. Of those who did spend money, the SHS participants spent 96 Swiss Francs compared to 112 Francs spent by the SyS group and 151 Francs spent by the EMP group. Addendum to chapter 3.1 4317% in the SHS group, 21% of the SyS group and 39% of the EMP group indicated to have spent more than 150 CHF during the past four weeks.

However, when avoidance-oriented coping was subdivided into 'social diversion'- and 'distraction'-oriented coping, EMP participants scored higher on seeking social diversion and lower on distraction. Addendum to chapter 3.1 44Compared to the SHS participants a significantly higher proportion of the SyS group had a low perception of control and significantly less SyS subjects indicated a high level of control. EMP participants indicated either a high or a low perception of control, whereas few ranked in the middle category.

The higher expenditures of project participants for health care not covered by health insurances may in part be a result of many of them belonging to a more affluent part of the population. Although we adjusted health care expenditures for educational level (see chapter 3.1) this may not have been sufficient control for all social class differences. Addendum to chapter 3.1 45It has been argued that persons who attribute their health complaints to the environment are more sensitive towards environmental disturbances (Sabo et al. 2000), especially odours (Ross et al. 1999). Based on our data the enhanced sensitivity to environmental disturbances seems rather to be a characteristic of people with bad health than an attribute of people relating their health complaints to environment exposures as the project participants did not indicate to be more annoyed of environmental disturbances than the symptomatic subgroup of the Swiss health survey, industrial noise being the exception. The latter is probably a result of the project's restriction to the city and surrounding of Basel, which is a more urban and industrialised area compared to the whole of Switzerland. Coping strategies are hypothesised to play an important role between the antecedents and outcomes of the stress process (Endler et al. 1990). In general, task-oriented coping styles have been associated with less depression and better perceived health status, whereas emotion-oriented coping styles are being negatively related to adaptation and good health (Cosway et al. 2000, Afari et al. 2000). Comparing the three main coping measures, the project participants did not differ from the participants of the Swiss health survey and scored even higher than the symptomatic subgroup of the Swiss health survey with respect to task oriented coping, whereas there was no difference at a statistically significant level regarding avoidance or emotion oriented coping. When the questions regarding 'avoidance' oriented coping were separated into 'social diversion' and 'distraction', project participants were again similar to the Swiss health survey participants. However, they differed significantly from the symptomatic subgroup of the survey preferring person-oriented social diversion as means of alleviating stress, in contrast to distracting themselves with other situations. Alow level of perceived control can lead to the feeling of being unable to alter or ameliorate situations which can result in resignation, helplessness and stress (Bailis et al. 2001). If this is combined with an unfavourable coping strategy, it can have negative effects on the health Addendum to chapter 3.1 46status. Project participants either indicated a high or a low level of perceived control but rarely ranked in the middle category. The proportion of participants with a high level of perceived control was even higher than in the Swiss health survey whereas the symptomatic subgroup of the Swiss health survey was most likely to indicate a low level of perceived control. The large proportion of project participants with a high level of perceived control parallels the high scores for task oriented coping strategy as both characteristics are interrelated. It may be interpreted that the participants' use of the environmental medicine project as a mean to solve their health problem may reflect a more task oriented coping strategy paralleled by a high level of perceived control and, therefore, it describes psycho-social attributes characteristic for this particular group. Alternatively, it may in part reflect the high socio-economic status of our study population as high socio-economic status has been associated with a greater sense of perceived control (Bailis et al. 2001). Thus, our models may have been insufficient in controlling for social status by just including educational level.

Evaluation of the project 854Evaluation of the project 4.1 Environmental Medicine Project in Switzerland: Did it Help?\u0001 4.1.1 Introduction The environmental medicine project Basel, Switzerland, counselled persons who related their health problems to environmental exposures. Complainants reported of symptom duration of several years (med. 3 yrs.) and having consulted physicians (69%) and/ or alternative health care services (60%) beforehand. Participants in the project presented complex problems, investigations were very time consuming. To evaluate the benefit of the study, participants' individual project perception was assessed about half a year after counselling. 4.1.2 Methods All participants took part in medical and psychological-psychiatric examinations and were visited at home by the corresponding environmental agency. Results were discussed in a case conference and subsequently, counselling was offered. Finally, the project was evaluated, using telephone interviews that were conducted by a person not otherwise involved with the project. Participants were asked about contentment with the assessments, time duration between enrolment and counselling and the advice-giving session. Further questions inquired about changes in the health status, fulfilment of expectations in the project, whether they would recommend participation in such a study to others and about the implementation of given advice and its effect. Each of these variables was tested with regard to age, sex, the \u0001published as an abstract as: Huss A, K\u00fcchenhoff J, Bircher Heller Scartazzini G, Schwarzenbach S, Waeber R, Wegmann L (2003).

In 40% of the cases the relation between environmental exposure and at least one health problem was rated to be plausible by the project team. Educational level was high: more than 50 % had a higher education (degree from an university or an university of applied sciences). 4.1.4 Results 54 of 63 project participants (86 %) could be interviewed for the evaluation. Descriptive results of variables of satisfaction and compliance are given in Table 4 and Table 5 below. Most participants were very satisfied with the medical examination (89 %) and the project or-ganisation as a whole (85 %), see Table 4. On the other hand, participants were least satis-fied with the psychometric questionnaires (13 % not satisfied) and the joint advice-giving- session (13 %). Eleven persons (20 %) would have preferred not to have a joint counselling session, but meetings with just one person, especially the physician only (6, 11 %).

Although the odds ratios remained more or less similar in a multivariate model, the confidence intervals widened and results were not statistically significant any more. Recommendation (yes/restricted versus no) of the project to other was not correlated to any of these factors (age, sex, occurrence of psychiatric diagnosis, environmental aetiology rated \"plausible\"). Fulfilled (or partly fulfilled) expectations in the project correlated negatively with age (p = 0.04) and positively with an Evaluation of the project 88environmental aetiology of the health problems (p = 0.05). Successful implementation (compared to no success or no implementation) of given advice was positively correlated with an environmental aetiology of the health problem (borderline, p=0.07). There was a tendency that those symptoms that got worse had already been present for a long duration at the time of enrolment (geometric mean 7 yrs, C.I. 3 - 15 yrs) compared to those that did not change (4 yrs, C.I. 3 - 7) or improved (3 yrs, C.I. 2 - 4 yrs.), (group difference, p = 0.1). Overall, 19 of 54 participants (35 %) report having seen a physician or an \"alternative\" physician in the time interval between counselling and evaluation interview. However, health status at the time of the interview did not differ significantly between those who had visited a physician and those who had not (p = 0.2). Those participants who felt better at the time of the interview described their expectations in the project more often as fulfilled (p = 0.06) and were those with a successful implementation of given advice (p < 0.0001). Persons with a fulfilled expectation would also recommend the project more often to others (p = 0.01) and had more frequently successfully implemented given advice (p = 0.0006). 4.1.5 Conclusions Environmental aetiology of health problem rated 'plausible' and younger age were predictors that determined satisfaction of the participants of our environmental medicine project. Other reasons to approve or disapprove of the project are more likely to be found on an individual level. Worsening of the health status might be an effect of older age. Approximately one third of the participants were able to benefit of the interdisciplinary project approach to improve long lasting health problems where support had been seeked in various health care settings beforehand. Summary of the main findings 895General Discussion 5.1 Summary of the main findings In the following, the research questions outlined in chapter 1.2.2 are answered in form of short summaries of the main findings that were discussed in detail in the respective chapters. I) What is the magnitude of environmental medicine counselling in general practice in Switzerland? In Switzerland, environmental medicine consultations in general practice are rare. The physicians of the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network reported that 0.03 % of all consultations were environment-related. There were considerable differences between physicians offering \"alternative\" medical therapies and the Sentinella physicians in the frequency of environmental medicine consultations. \"Alternative\" physicians reported 0.3 % of the consultations or around 10 patients per physician and year. In addition, the character of reported symptoms and suspected environmental exposures differed between the physician groups. II) What are characteristics of the environmental medicine project participants (e.g. attitude towards stress, use of 'alternative' health care services, reported illnesses), compared to a representative (symptomatic) sample of the Swiss population? Environmental medicine project participants had a higher level of education. A higher proportion had undergone a medical treatment because of chronic bronchitis or aller-gies and reported more sleep disturbances. A further characteristic of the study population was its higher use of alternative medical health care services and high expenditures for health care not covered by insurances. Little differences were found Summary of the main findings 90with respect to coping styles, but project participants reported a much higher level of perceived control. IIIa) What are the main findings of the medical, psychological-psychiatric and environmental assessments? Predominant health complaints included unspecific or general and respiratory symptoms. Biological or chemical exposures from indoor sources (e.g. formalde-hyde, mould) were the most common suspected environmental exposure, followed by electromagnetic fields. Most frequent (somatic) medical diagnoses were diseases of the respiratory system and mucous membranes followed by diagnoses of general symptoms (such as headache, fatigue etc.), gastrointestinal diseases, skin and neurological diseases. Asthma diagnoses were more prevalent than in the general population. Two thirds of the participants had at least one psychiatric diagnosis related to the health complaints in question. Most frequently diagnosed were personality disorders and somatoform disorders. Psychiatric diagnoses were more prevalent than in the general population. No chemicals with levels described in the literature as toxicologically relevant could be measured in any of the homes. However, in five cases a relevant exposure could not be measured any more, but had evidently occurred in the past (pesticides, mixtures of diverse solvents, asbestos). IIIb How do health complaints and suspected exposures correspond to the findings of the medical, psychological-psychiatric and environmental assessments? The simultaneous assessment of the symptoms yielded that of the reported Summary of the main findings 91symptoms, 34 % were plausibly related to medical findings, 65 % to psychological- psychiatric findings and 24 % to environmental exposures. The summation of symptom plausibility was greater than 100 % because 28 % of the symptoms were judged to have multiple plausibilities i.e. findings from more than one assessment- field could plausibly explain the existence of the health complaint. At least one 'multiple plausible symptom' occurred in 51 % of the participants. This number is an indication of the complexity of problems presented by the participants in the environmental medicine project. Altogether, 40 % of the participants offered at least one plausible theory of the environmental aetiology of their symptoms. IVa) What EMF exposure level can be found in the subgroup of participants who attributed their health complaints to electromagnetic fields? Most of those 25 persons who suspected EMF as cause of their symptoms were ex- posed to low-frequency electric fields. Only few persons had an exposure of low-fre- quency magnetic or high-frequency electromagnetic fields above the detection limit, none of the legal threshold levels were exceeded in any of the homes. IVb) How can the results of the measurements be evaluated with respect to their health relevance? Relevance of the assessed electromagnetic fields was judged with a set of criteria: the fields had to exceed one tenth of the Swiss threshold values and the exposure had to occur in an area where the respective person spent several hours or more each day. In addition, a time and spatial context between the exposure and the health problem had to exist with the prerequisite that the exposure occurred before the onset of symptoms. Summary of the main findings 92IVc) How do reported health complaints correspond to the findings of the electromagnetic field (EMF) measurements? The project team rated symptoms from 8 of 25 participants (32 %) to be plausibly related to EMF. All these symptoms concerned reduced well-being such as sleeping problems or formication. Thus, the assessments gave an indication that few persons had an elevated susceptibility towards electromagnetic fields. V) How do the complainants describe their health approximately half a year after participation in the environmental medicine project? How many were successful in the implementation of given advice, and were the expectations into the project fulfilled? 41 % of the participants reported an improved health status approximately half a year after counselling, 48 % reported no change and 11 % reported worsening. 37 % reported a successful implementation of the advice, 37 % report no success and 26 % no implementation. Environmental aetiology of the health problem rated as \"plausible\" and age were predictors that determined satisfaction of the participants of our environmental medicine project. General discussion 935.2 Discussion The specific findings of this thesis have been discussed in detail in the respective chapters. In this chapter, more general aspects, the limitations of the study and the implications of the research results for environmental medicine counselling in Switzerland are discussed. The chapter concludes with a brief outlook into further activities. 5.2.1 General aspects of study results Environmental medicine problems were rare in general practice in Switzerland, comprising 0.03 % of all consultations. In the Basel pilot project, participants reported long lasting health problems. The majority of the complainants had sought help from a wide range of health care providers before enrolling in the study. Presented problems were complex: Every other patient had one or more symptoms that could be plausibly explained by concurrent findings from at least two disciplines. Diagnoses of psychiatric problems as causes were common. However, a psychiatric diagnosis did not exclude environmentally caused symptoms. More than a third of the participants implemented at least pieces of advice given during counselling successfully and described an improved health status approximately half a year after participation. Psychologic-psychiatric burden The proportion of participants with psychological-psychiatric problems in the Basel environ-mental medicine project group was high and could explain almost half of all reported symptoms (see chapter 3.1). Comparison of this finding to results of other environmental medicine counselling institutions or projects is difficult due to differences in methodological approaches. However, many studies of persons complaining about MCS (multiple chemical sensitivity) or IEI (Idiopathic Environmental Illness) show a predominance of psychological- psychiatric problems in these individuals (Black et al. 1990; Eis et al. 1995; Eis et al. 2002; General 94Davidoff et al. 1996; Fiedler et al. 1996; Blaschko et al. 1999; Black et al. 2000; Bornschein et al. 2000; Jason et al. 2000; Labarge et al. 2000). As a result of this finding, the question has been raised as to whether \"syndromes\" in environmental medicine might just be variants of somatoform disorders (Wiesm\u00fcller et al. 2003). In the Basel project, 21 % of the project participants were diagnosed with a somatoform disorder (ICD 10 code F 45). These disorders were important but could not explain the majority of the presented problems. However, the study's findings strongly suggest that assessment of complainants' illnesses should always include a psychological-psychiatric component. Eis et al., for the German MCS multi-centre study, reported that 40 % of the participants suspected to suffer from MCS (Eis et al. 2002). Although this proportion varied considerably between centres, with a range of 19 - 77 %, it is still much higher than in the Basel study, where only two persons (3 %) suspected to suffer from MCS. The high percentage of persons suspecting MCS in the German study might result from frequent media attention given to MCS in Germany (Dr. D. Eis, personal communication, 12. March 2004). The low proportion in the Basel project, on the other hand, might be due to the deep mistrust of these groups in \"conventional\" medicine in Switzerland and the fear of being \"psychiatrised\", i.e. a perceived one-sided explanation of health complaints as being caused by psychological-psychiatrical problems (www.mcs-liga.ch and personal communication with Chr. Schifferle, chairman of the MCS-Liga Switzerland, 1. March 2004). As psychological-psychiatric problems occurred so often in the participants of the pilot project, a more detailed qualitative analysis was conducted (K\u00fcchenhoff et al. 2004). Participants' self-rating of having a high or low psychological-psychiatric burden was extracted from psychometric questionnaires. Expert rating of psychological-psychiatric burden was assessed in case conferences. This analysis yielded four subgroups with either converging or diverging opinion. Each of these four groups shared distinct characteristics: General discussion 95The first group with a low psychological-psychiatric burden in both ratings comprised those with the highest percentage of environmental exposures as a plausible cause of the health complaints. The second group rated themselves as having a high psychological-psychiatric burden but were rated with a low burden by the experts. This group was dominated by persons who described their psychological-psychiatric well-being as affected by chronic diseases. The third group rated themselves as having a low psychological-psychiatric burden but were rated with a high burden by the experts. Participants in this group were often characterised as having had difficult starting situations in life, but having managed to make their way in life with an enormous effort. Nevertheless, self-esteem in this group was fragile and the attribution of health complaints to the environment served as a relief, warded off fear of failure and stabilised self-esteem. The fourth group (high psychological-psychiatric burden in both participant and expert ratings) shared a history of strong psychosocial burden and biographical trauma. A fixation on bodily symptoms seemed to be a surrogate of self-care. Converging opinion between patients and therapists of the theory of the aetiology and course of psychological-psychiatric burden have been shown to be an important factor for successful psychotherapies (Deale et al. 2001). A converging opinion thus includes not only the acknowledgment of the existence of a psychological-psychiatric burden, but also the acceptance of its aetiological relevance. The advice given in the counselling session of the project included advice from medical and psychiatric-psychological specialists as well as from environmental specialists. Possibly because the advice given was of a general nature, membership of one of the four subgroups was not an influential factor in the ability to successfully implement advice. High percentage of environmental exposures rated a \"plausible\" cause The main difference of the results from the Basel project compared to several German studies, for example the MCS-study (Eis et al. 2002) seems to be the higher proportion of participants in the Basel project whose health problems had a \"plausible\" environmental General discussion 96aetiology. Environmental medicine studies in Germany show that environmentally related symptoms occur in less than 10 % of complainants (Koppel et al. 1995; Schulze-R\u00f6bbecke et al. 1999; Br\u00f6lsch et al. 2001; Herr et al. 2004). One environmental medicine centre reported that patients mainly presented with a mixture of allergologic and psychiatric problems but few environmental exposure-related problems (Eberlein-K\u00f6nig et al. 2002). The difference between the Basel project and others might originate from differences between criteria for evaluating plausibility of the relation between environmental exposures and the health complaints. For example, results of the MCS-study in Germany show that there are considerable differences in the interpretation of criteria between centres: A causal relation of the exposure and the symptoms was rated \"probable\" or \"very probable\" in 78 % of the participants of the Bredstedt centre. However, in the Giessen centre, these ratings never occurred. The authors speculated whether different \"pathogenetic concepts\" of the physicians might account for the differences between the centres (Eis et al. 2002). Another reason for the higher percentage of environmental \"plausible\" cases in Basel might be that health complaints and suspected exposures differ to those of the German projects. For example, respiratory symptoms were more commonly reported in Basel than in the MCS- study (Eis et al. 2002). In the Basel study, persons reporting respiratory symptoms were significantly more likely to be classified as having a \"plausible\" environmental aetiology than those who described other health complaints (see chapter 3.1). Although symptoms reported in the Basel project were more or less similar to those reported in projects in Aachen, Augsburg and Munich (Br\u00f6lsch et al. 2001; Eberlein-K\u00f6nig et al. 2002; Schulze et al. 2004), there were differences with respect to the suspected exposures. Virtually none of the Basel participants suspected amalgam or wood preservatives which were the two most frequently suspected exposures in the MCS study and in several other German studies. In Switzerland, persons concerned about amalgam are more likely to seek advice from a dentist or specialist physician (see chapter 2.1). There is, as yet, no consensus regarding health effects that may be due to Amalgam or wood preservative exposures (Gupta et al. 1997; Gottwald et al. General discussion 972001). It might be speculated that the higher proportion of people who suspect these controversial environmental exposures would have led to a lower proportion of environmentally \"plausible\" health complaints. On the other hand, EMF played an important role in the Basel project but were not suspected as cause of the health problems in other studies. EMF, as cause of health problems, are about as equally controversial as Amalgam or wood preservatives. In an environmental medicine study in Giessen, Germany, of 392 persons who contacted the outpatient unit, only 58 (15 %) finally participated in the study (Herr et al. 2004). This contrasts with the response rate in Basel where 46 % of contacted persons eventually participated. Apparently, different recruitment methods or selection criteria were used and the studies may not be comparable. Another reason for the higher percentage of environmentally \"plausible\" health complaints might result from our approach of assessing environmental exposures by means of systematically conducted home visits by the environmental agencies. The German MCS-multi-centre-study emphasised human-bio-monitoring (assessment of exposures in body fluids) as means of detecting environmental exposures and only 12 % of the participants were visited at home (Eis et al. 2002). There have been peer-reviewed publications critically discussing the relevance of the environmental findings as assessed in human-bio-monitoring (Straff et al. 2002; Schulze et al. 2004). In our project we could include indoor climate parameters in our environmental assessments. Parallel to the findings of most other environmental medicine projects however, we found no indications of levels of chemicals, described in the literature as toxicologically relevant, in any of the homes in the Basel project. Systematically conducted home visits give the opportunity to pick up less obvious exposures, as for example high carbon dioxide levels at night indicating insufficient ventilation. Insufficient ventilation has been shown to be associated to adverse health outcomes, especially respiratory illnesses (Sepp\u00e4nen et al. 1999). Hutter et al. emphasised the necessity of home visits to identify potential risk factors possibly overlooked by the General discussion 98participants (Hutter et al. 2001). Since home visits seemed necessary for the determination of environmental exposures, they should be included as one of the central elements of environmental exposure assessments in environmental medicine counselling. Is environmental medicine counselling useful? Assessments of satisfaction with environmental medicine counselling have been reported in peer-reviewed publications (Nagel et al. 1994; Hutter et al. 2001; Arcan et al. 2002; Herr et al. 2004). However, the project evaluations differed considerably with respect to the questions that were asked. Whereas 37 % of the Basel project participants reported an improved health status after implementation of at least one of the given recommendations; 18 % in the Aachen project described an improvement (Arcan et al. 2002). Approximately 2 years after enrolment, 38 % of the patients felt better or reported no complaints in Giessen, Germany (Herr et al. 2004). Taking into account that complainants generally report that their problems are of a long duration, and the complexity of the presented problems; these results show that patients attributing their health problems to environmental exposures can benefit from interdisciplinary environmental medicine counselling. 5.2.2 Limitations and problems of this study One of the limitations to the study was that it was of case series design. Case series are unlikely to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a causal relation between defined exposures and an outcome (Rothman et al. 1998, Gordis 2000, Hennekens et al. 1987). Even when environmental exposures have been shown to be related to health outcomes in epidemiological studies, causality is generally difficult to demonstrate in individual cases. Thus, in the environmental medicine project, plausibility, rather than causality, of a relation between exposure and symptoms was tested. To estimate a plausible relation between the exposure and the health complaints, a pragmatic approach was chosen based on several criteria that had to be met for a \"plausible\" rating. Peer reviewed scientific reports were the basis from which environmental exposures General discussion 99and their health effects were evaluated. However, there are considerable gaps in published research. In the case of EMF for example (see chapter 3.2), gaps include uncertainty regarding whether a dose-response relation exists (Marino et al. 2000), whether the variability of EMF might be more important than EMF-maxima (Lee et al. 2002) or whether exposure to different frequencies might be related to different health problems (Neutra et al. 2001, Leitgeb et al. 2003). Legal threshold values and regulations should give a clear indication of perceived risk. Depending on the source of the field, however (see chapter 3.2), these threshold values vary widely both within Switzerland and between Switzerland and its neighbours, and thus cannot be used for the estimation of a plausibility of a health effect. In summary, the extensive assessments carried out in the Basel project gave an indication that few persons had an elevated susceptibility towards EMF. Further research will be needed to elucidate these relations. Persons with health complaints attributed to environmental exposures have been shown to use the health care system more often than matched controls (Sabo et al. 2000; Gibson et al. 2003), and this has been shown to be related to frequent changes of the physician (Eis 1999; Hornberg 1999). This so called \"doctor shopping\" has been defined as changing of doctors without professional referral in the same illness period (Lo et al. 1994; Leung et al. 2003). Among other factors, like e.g. the physician-patient relationship, it is associated to chronicity of illness (Sato et al. 1995). If indeed \"doctor shopping\" is present in environmental medicine patients, its prevention would help reducing associated health care costs. In the Basel study, we gathered information about the use of the health care system before and after participation in the project. Project participants had used alternative health care services more often and spent more money for health care than a symptomatic sample of the General discussion 100general population. Independent of the reported health status at the time of the evaluation interview, 37 % of the participants report having consulted a physician or \"alternative\" physician in the time period between advice-giving and the interview. An obvious limitation of our project is that we cannot differentiate consultations that derive from regular visits due to chronic illness or new illness periods. Predictions on the prevention of \"doctor shopping\" and whether health care costs can be reduced with an interdisciplinary environmental medicine approach can therefore not be made. A follow-up of the participants might improve knowledge on the effectiveness of interdisciplinary environmental medicine counselling over alonger time period. Afurther limitation of the study was that we could not specify which advice was more or less often implemented. The counselling session itself was not recorded. In particular, there are no records of what advice was passed on to participants. The interviewers for the project evaluation were not involved in any other project assessments and apart from answering standardised questions, participants could freely characterise their view of the project. However, because psychological-psychiatric advice is rather sensitive and reports of the implementation of specific advice was generally not asked for by the interviewers. Persons interested in participation were prepared to travel to Basel from as far as Liechtenstein and the Ticino. Due to the restrictions in counselling, only residents of the area of Basel were eligible to participate. This limitation was set by the organisation that financed the project. In addition, project resources did not enable recruitment over such a large area. Br\u00f6lsch et al. (Br\u00f6lsch et al. 2001) showed that environmental exposures suspected to cause health complaints vary by time and area. Inclusion of other areas might have thus changed the range of suspected exposures. An extension of the project area might have also yielded some more cases. However, given the large range of suspected environmental exposures it would be reasonable to predict similar study results for the rest of Switzerland. General discussion 1015.2.3 Implication for future environmental medicine counselling In answering the question of whether environmental medicine counselling in Switzerland is necessary, several views have to be considered: that of the complainants, that of the physicians and that of the environmental agencies. The results of the environmental medicine project strongly suggest that only an interdisciplinary structure including medical, psychiatric and environmental expertise is likely to adequately diagnose health problems and advise persons with symptoms attributed to environmental exposures. Although only a limited number of persons of the whole population seem to be concerned, those who are, are in need of an advice that cannot be provided by the existing structures. A considerable percentage of the participants in our project as well as those in other environmental medicine counselling studies (Nagel et al. 1994; Hutter et al. 2001; Arcan et al. 2002; Herr et al. 2004) benefited from the interdisciplinary environmental medicine counselling. This shows that such a structure seems necessary and useful for complainants. Information from one year's surveillance by the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network, showed that over, relatively few consultations per physician in General Practice were reported to be environmentally related, giving a total of approximately 8500 consultations in one year. For the majority of these consultations, the physicians reported that medical advice alone was adequate to address the problems. On the other hand, the questionnaire that was answered by physicians did not include an item measuring psychological-psychiatric factors. This study and others strongly suggest that psychological-psychiatric factors may be responsible for some health complaints. Reporting by physicians was probably biased to identifying environmentally \"plausible\" cases as those cases with exposures that have already been identified as possible causes of health complaints for some time in the scientific literature (see chapter 2.1). In only 2 % of the environmentally related consultations, were patients encouraged to seek additional help from General discussion 102an environmental agency. This might be interpreted as showing that, from point of view of the general practitioners, interdisciplinary environmental medicine assessments are not perceived as an important and necessary component of the health care system. One of the lessons of the environmental medicine project was, however, that all participating professionals became aware of their own limits the moment other areas of expertise were included in the assessments and information and data were exchanged. On the other hand, this survey was representative of GPs, internists and paediatricians only. Interest in contributing to an interdisciplinary assessment may vary by specialisation of medical professionals. For example, from 17 persons interested in participation in the environmental medicine project who were referred by their physician, 6 (35 %) came from the allergology unit of the university hospital of Basel. Environmental medicine cases may be more frequent in these specialisation units: Allergological problems were common in environmental medicine participants in our project (see chapter 3.1) as well as in other studies (Schulze-R\u00f6bbecke et al. 1999; Eberlein-K\u00f6nig et al. 2002). Alternatively, the higher percentage of referrals by the University Hospital in Basel may have occurred because more physicians in this unit were acquainted with the project. There is a small, but distinct need for interdisciplinary environmental medicine counselling by the professionals in the environmental agencies (see chapter 2.1) who in general lack the medical or psychological-psychiatric expertise. Whereas the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre has reported a trend of increasing numbers of consultations over the last 10 years (Schw. Toxi. Informationszentrum 2003), others like the State Laboratory Basel-City reported no such trend. However, we could show that persons with health problems approach these agencies for advice. Thus, an interdisciplinary environmental medicine counselling structure would be a useful supplement to the counselling that is already provided by the agencies. Outlook 1035.3 Outlook Knowledge about low-dose environmental exposures and health complaints is limited. Some specific gaps in the knowledge of low-dose exposures and their health effects may never be filled, for example health effects from different mixtures of solvents, etc. However, other gaps such as concerning electromagnetic fields are more likely to be filled, given current progression in knowledge. However, these gaps in knowledge may be better addressed by analytical studies, than further studies of case series. Aconsensus regarding criteria to be used in defining an environmental exposure as a \"plausible\" or \"implausible\" cause of health complaints is needed. The questions put forward by Sparks, about which items should be assessed in the case of a patient suspecting idiopathic environmental illness, provide a basis for the development of such criteria (Sparks 2000). Apart from the questions about dose, similar questions have been discussed in the Basel study (see chapters 3.1 and 3.2). Consensual criteria would facilitate comparisons between studies. The underlying hypothesis providing the background to this project is that efficient counselling of environmental medicine leads to an improved health status of the participants and subsequently, to a reduced availment of health care. This project provided support for this hypothesis in that participants reported that advice given had been helpful in alleviating problems. The question of whether environmental medicine counselling could reduce \"doctor shopping\" was not addressed. Future evaluations should include measurement of \"doctor shopping\" into the assessment of the efficacy of environmental medicine counselling. In 1999 the Swiss Government proposed an article in the new federal law on chemical substances (ChemG 2000) that would have set a legal basis for measures against indoor pollution, e.g. specific declarations on products for indoor use, or restrictions or bans, and for setting air quality standards in non-industrial environments (\"Wohngiftartikel\"). This article Outlook 104was rejected by the Parliament in summer 2000. Thus, environmental agencies still lack a rationale to provide in-depth consultation such as home visits or measurements, to people complaining about environmental exposures. There are a few exceptions like e.g. the State Laboratory Basel-City that has an explicit assignment in prevention. This assignment permits the State Laboratory to perform home visits and, within limitations, measurements. Although other agencies do not have this function, some still do counsel persons approaching their institution for advice. However, the absence of a legal basis may pose a problem in times of decreasing governmental budgets. The government of the canton Basel-Landschaft for example is momentarily (2004) trying to reduce services that are conducted without an existing legal requirement (communication with Dr. J. Tremp, Amt f\u00fcr Umwelt und Energie, Liestal, Basel-Landschaft, 19. Feb. 2004). Existing environmental counselling could thus be reduced in order to save money. Consequently, this could pose a serious problem for an anticipated future environmental medicine network which would have to rely on the expertise from environmental agencies (see below). It might not be sufficient to leave environmental exposure assessments entirely to private laboratories who have an economic interest in performing measurements and whose services may only be available to a more affluent part of the population. In general, participants in the Basel pilot project reported several symptoms and suspected more than one environmental exposure as the cause of symptoms. \"Plausibility\" assess-ments were conducted for each exposure and each symptom separately. This approach was adequate for the complexity of the presented problems. On the other hand, it was extremely time intensive with almost 30 hours work time required for each participant. If a structure for environmental medicine is to be implemented in the Basel area, it will have to maintain the balance between adequate assessment and costs. Project team recommendations include pooling the medical and the psychological-psychiatric examination: If a physician with an advanced training in psychiatry and knowledge in internal medicine or allergology could Outlook 105integrate both of these assessments, the required time (and therefore financial resources) could be reduced significantly. Environmental experts, however, should always be consulted. Existing local environmental protection agencies would be well qualified to have this role as they have the experience and could, when necessary, carry out a home visit. Annual demand for the proposed environmental medicine counselling structure in Basel would probably not exceed consultation numbers in the environmental medicine project; approximately 50 - 70 consultations per year. A proposal for an environmental medicine counselling service in the Basel area is currently under discussion (April 2004).
