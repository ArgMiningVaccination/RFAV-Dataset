I traveled with my father, who is a pediatrician, to rural areas in India, educating families about vaccinations. My interest in pulmonology started during my pediatrics residency. I enjoyed taking care of patients with chronic pulmonary and sleep problems and learning about pulmonary physiology. As a pediatric pulmonologist, I specialize in sleep medicine and caring for patients with neuromuscular disorders. I am particularly interested in working with patients who are dependent on respiratory support, such as ventilators, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) machines and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines. I also like to treat and manage patients with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders. I believe in a holistic team approach when working with my patients and families. Many of my patients have multisystem problems that impact their pulmonary condition. I communicate with everyone on their healthcare team to provide the most appropriate care to each patient. I believe it takes a village to care for children. I strive to learn about the newest therapies to keep my patients and families informed. I greatly value the parents' perspective when caring for a child with a chronic medical condition. My research focuses on quality improvement and understanding and improving treatments for neuromuscular and sleep disorders. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I also like running and I participate in events related to the Flying Pig Marathon. DO: Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA, 2006.
