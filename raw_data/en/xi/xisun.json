As the pandemic wears on, it becomes increasingly difficult to cope with the alarming updates and the infor mation overload that has saturated daily life. The new normal demands adherence to both mandated procedures and individual preventive measures. While COVID -19 vaccines offer the best protection against disease, they also raise a host of additional question s and concerns, which are typical reactions to anything new. People question the vaccines' necessity, safety and efficacy. More than 170 million Americans have been vaccinated, while others remain uncertain and in search of answers. Family and friends can help their undecided loved ones voice their concerns and access the resources they need to make an informed decision. Effective Communication Opening a conversation on the topi c of the COVID -19 vaccine need not be awkward. The communication tips below can help. Listen The most effective communicators are those who place the greatest emphasis on listening \u2014 without judging. Empathy, kindness and patience help reticent people open up and share their doubts and questions. It is important to acknowledge their concerns and not to rush the conversation. Help them articulate their concerns by asking open - ended questions and providing straightforward, non - judgmental answers. Ask Permission While it may be tempting to provide information, ask permission first. It is likely that people already have some foundational knowledge and are struggling with specific issues. Soliciting their permission is respectful and keeps the conversatio n moving forward.

Help them uncover the motivation most meaningful to them . Help with the Process Some people are not comfortable or proficient in navigating the healthcare system or may be nervous about the vaccine process itself.
