Kildsig Center for Pharmaceutical Processing Research Education MS Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 1995, The University of Kansas PhD, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 1997, The University of Kansas Post-Doctoral Fellow, Department of Integrative and Molecular Physiology, The University of Kansas - Medical Center 1997-1999 Research Dr. Knipp's laboratory is dedicated to the utilization of new and improved models for assessing pharmaceutical performance. The laboratory's research interests include preclinical in vitro and in vivo ADMET screening, physicochemical characterization, early formulation development, and performing pharmacokinetic studies of new and traditional chemical entities. His laboratory has been recently focused on the development of a novel, direct contact human blood brain barrier triculture model for screening permeability-linked neuroactivity. Cultured in the presence of neurons, this flexible platform in vitro model has been applied to assess neurotoxicity and screening compounds with an observed neurotherapeutic/neurotoxic effect. This project is currently funded by the EPA. His laboratory has also been collaborating on two significant NIH funded projects: 1) an R01 on the development of novel antiviral compounds with the potential to treat Ebolavirus; and 2) a larger, multi-institutional U54 grant aimed at developing agents that may provide rapid rescue from cyanide exposure. Dr. Knipp also currently serves as the faculty director of the Purdue Translational Pharmacology (PTP) CTSI Core Facility, where he maintains a strong interest in the utilizing rodent and juvenile and adult porcine models for testing the pharmacokinetics formulations under stress free conditions.
