Naturopathy uses a combination of therapies, including acupuncture, counseling, exercise therapy, botanicals, hydrotherapy, nutrition, physical therapies (eg, heat or cold therapy, ultrasound, massage), guided imagery, and stress management. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians encourages using vaccinations according to guidelines from authoritative sources (eg, United States Public Health Service) when contraindications are lacking.

Evidence for Naturopathy Many naturopathic diagnostic and treatment methods have limited or low-quality evidence. Intravenous vitamin C infusions are commonly given by naturopathic providers despite lack of high-quality evidence for efficacy ( [1](/en-gb/professional/special-subjects/integrative,-complementary,-and-alternative-medicine/naturopathy#v39504774) [ References Naturopathy began as a formal health care discipline in the US during the early 1900s.

Many of the studies of the naturopathic approach are small but have demonstrated non-inferiority to conventional medicine approaches and cost effectiveness at times. The whole-system, whole-patient philosophy approach of naturopathy has shown benefit in patients with heart disease, pain, type 2 diabetes, and mental health and other chronic health conditions ( [3](/en-gb/professional/special-subjects/integrative,-complementary,-and-alternative-medicine/naturopathy#v39504774) [ References Naturopathy began as a formal health care discipline in the US during the early 1900s.
