When all of these organs are balanced, the body is healthy. This is the concept known as Chi. To be healthy, one's Chi must flow freely throughout the body. Your Chi must maintain a balance of [ yin (cooling) and yang (heating)](https://www.ancient.eu/Yin_and_Yang/) elements. If anything throws this balance off, you can get tired or sick. You can also start to experience issues with your skin. The theory behind traditional Chinese medicine is using natural sources and lifestyle changes to stimulate the body's own restorative mechanisms. Traditional Chinese Medicine Approach to Skincare A traditional Chinese medicine approach to skincare uses a combination of techniques to stimulate the body's own restorative mechanisms. These techniques include- - herbology - acupuncture/acupressure - diet therapy Chinese Medicinal Herbs Used in Skincare Herbs and roots have been used for thousands of years to treat skin conditions in TCM.

Acupuncture in Skincare Acupuncture a branch of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting sterilized, single-use, disposable, incredibly thin needles into the skin. An acupuncturist determines where to focus the acupuncture needles by assessing the physiological causes of any imbalances. This method is a gentle way to stimulate the body's natural healing response. These responses include the release of endorphins (which can reduce pain and stress levels) and the activation of your immune system (which is called to action because it is responding to an injury). Acupressure in Skincare Like acupuncture, acupressure stimulates the flow of energy through the body by removing energy blockages. Acupressure helps increase blood flow and lymphatic drainage. This leads to increased oxygen and nutrient delivery to the skin and helps detoxify as well. The end result is healthier-looking, glowing skin. But unlike acupuncture, acupressure uses touch rather than needles. And you can do it at home. A jade roller is the perfect at-home skincare tool to practice acupressure on yourself. Jade is believed to have a cooling effect that can relieve sinus pain and pressure and reduce stress and puffiness. How to Use a Jade Roller The main idea behind using a jade roller for acupressure is lymphatic drainage. This is a form of massage that pushes fluids to your lymph nodes. The fluids are then processed and filtered out of your system. When you perform this massage consistently, you'll reap lots of depuffing, glow-boosting benefits. Follow these steps when using your jade roller- - Start at your clavicle using an up-and-down motion. - Roll up-and-down over your neck. - Switch to a back-and-forth roll that starts at the center of your chin toward your ear. Repeat this all the way up to your cheekbone. - Repeat the vertical roll on your forehead, starting from the middle of your face moving out toward your temples. - Flip the roller over and use the smaller attachment under your eyes in a horizontal motion toward your temples. - Roll once more down your nose with the small side, moving it in a horizontal motion.
