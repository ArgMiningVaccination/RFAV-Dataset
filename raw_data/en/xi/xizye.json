It provides an overview of our faculty's research areas and focal points of research, it explains our policy choices, and it presents the output of our research institute in the years 2005 up to and including 2010. The structure of the report and the aspects covered in it are guided by the Standard Evaluation Protocol (SEP) as developed in collaboration between the Association of Dutch Universities (VSNU), the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), and the main Dutch (funding) organisation for scientific research (NWO). It is herewith submitted to an external committee of recognized experts in the fields of research in which our research institute is active. The aim of this self-study and the discussion of its findings with the external committee is to strengthen our research institute through a combination of self- reflection and external assessment. We are confident to profit from this review round as much as we have profited from such exercises in the past. In various places in this report we give specific account of our response not only to the feedback and suggestions for improvement received through the previous external assessment (covering the period 1998-2004), but also to the midterm review of our research in 2008 (see also annexes A, B and C of this report). The research landscape in the Netherlands and elsewhere is undergoing a rapid transformation. Research funding increasingly has to be earned through competitive research funding schemes. Universities and individual faculties are expected to join forces around common research specialisations and profiles instead of functioning as groups of individual researchers. The Bologna reforms have integrated the PhD training more closely with other phases of university education. These developments require additional efforts and a rethink of traditional ways of organising research. We believe that the nature of our faculty as it has developed since its foundation in 1994 is an important asset in this transformation: First, focusing research on specific core themes has been an element of our research institute since its inception. We have always functioned as a team in building our young faculty. Second, while in recent years we have grown quickly from a small to a medium- sized faculty, we are still small enough to know each other's work and to 6 collaborate across disciplinary borders wherever possible. Third, inter- and transdisciplinary work is a cornerstone of our identity, as shown in our research (and teaching) programmes in Arts and Culture and in European Studies. The specific teaching approach of Maastricht University, called problem-based learning, focuses on the definition of research problems and their collaborative solution in teams. Integration of teaching and research and a focus on topical problems, then, is daily practice in our faculty. Yet, all of these assets do not bring success automatically. While we can be proud of a number of achievements, there are weaker areas which require our continued attention. We have identified specific problems in our research institute which we want to tackle in the years ahead, and regarding which we hope to receive critical feedback and suggestions through the assessment exercise. In addition to serving the formal assessment purpose, we trust that this report provides a lively and transparent overview of how we developed in the period 2005-2010 in our pursuit to be an inspiring and successful place of research. We hope that our curiosity about the world around us and our enthusiasm to come up with stimulating and innovative answers to societal problems transpire through these pages.

Objectives and research area The research institute of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Maastricht University focuses on societies and cultures as they unfolded during the modern and contemporary era. We study the interrelationships of Europeanisation, globalisation, scientific and technological development, political change and cultural innovation. We are interested in how today's societies cope with these challenges through practices of remembrance; governance techniques; strategies for managing knowledge, technologies and risks; and ways of dealing with diversity and inequality. Increasingly our traditional focus on the development of societies and cultures in Western Europe is juxtaposed with a focus on the whole of Europe and on global affairs. In our research we are aware that understanding our present world is impossible without insight into its past. This is why historical research is a key element of our scholarly and educational identity. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Maastricht University was established in 1994. Its Research Institute encompasses and organises all research conducted by the academic staff of the Faculty. The main organisational format through which our research is conducted are the (currently three) research programmes within the research institute, namely 1. Politics and Culture in Europe (PCE) 2. Science, Technology, and Society Studies (STS) 3. Arts, Media and Culture (AMC) Each programme comprises around 30 researchers and is chaired by one senior staff member. The members of the research programmes come from the faculty's five departments (Philosophy, History, Literature & Arts, Technology & Society Studies, and Political Science). None of the three research programmes is tied to a specific academic department within the faculty. The programme on Politics and Culture in Europe focuses on European Studies and comprises mostly political scientists, but also historians and members of the Technology & Society Studies Department. 10 The staff members of the Science, Technology and Society programme come mostly from the Department of Technology & Society Studies, but also from History, Philosophy, and Literature & Art. The research programme on Arts, Media and Culture is composed of members from the Departments of History, Literature & Art, Philosophy, and Politics (see chapter I.4. and Table 1 for more information). Each of these three programmes runs a three-weekly scientific colloquium which is open to all our academic staff (which includes our PhD candidates), as well as to interested students, mainly from our two Research Masters. Our research programmes also organise joint conferences and workshops, while there is common management of the faculty's graduate school and joint selection of candidates for the school. Two key elements in our identity stand out: intellectual exchange across the borders of our research programmes and shared responsibility for the strategic development and direction of our research institute. This intersecting or \"matrix\" structure is motivated by the faculty's focus on topics which are typically situated at the interface of divergent perspectives and disciplines. We have sought to organise our research in a way which makes an interdisciplinary focus and approach self-evident and inevitable rather than a practice which requires an extra effort. In order to further carve out the academic profile of our faculty, our research institute has identified three thematically defined focal points around which the various activities of the members of the research programmes converge. Our three focal points are 1. Administrative Governance 2. Science, Technology and Society 3. Cultural Memory and Diversity Each of these focal points encompasses specific well-defined research interests1 and is embedded in one of the three research programmes mentioned above. The focal points were defined in 2008. 1 See Part B below for a more detailed explanation of the thematic areas defined by these focal points. 11 Their introduction was originally stimulated by the so-called 'portfolio initiative' of the University's Executive Board aimed at strengthening the University's research profile by stimulating faculties to designate specific areas of research.2 The purpose of these focal points is to define certain areas of research in which our faculty wants to concentrate its research efforts and become a centre of excellence at the European or even global level. As such they are an instrument to focus minds on common research topics and to sharpen and communicate our profile to society.3 The decision to establish these focal points was also linked to the 2008 mid-term review, during which the committee suggested to define our profile more clearly and to clarify what research at FASoS is all about. The focal points have proven effective in terms of the internal organisation of our research and our scientific colloquia. Although this is hard to substantiate, especially given the short time since the introduction of the focal points, we believe they have helped in the important task of communicating our research to the outside world. Within the overall structure sketched above, research programmes are the organisational format, while focal points denote a thematic focus in areas where interesting societal problems exist and where our faculty has the necessary expertise and critical mass to make an internationally visible contribution to the solution of these problems. It is however not the intention of the focal point policy to strictly align each and every faculty research effort. Focal points leave room for the emergence of new research initiatives from within focal points. One example is the development of the Globalisation and Development Initiative (GDI) , which was originally housed by the STS programme but which will develop into a fourth research programme over the coming years. Its core team currently consists of one full and one part-time professor, three postdoctoral researchers and four (from 1 September 2011: five) PhD candidates. Therefore it is not yet of the same size as the three existing research programmes. 2 Between 2008 and 2011 the research programmes profited from financial support by the UM Central Board in form of the so-called portfolio initiative. The funds which are available to the research programmes were used for organising workshops, providing sabbaticals, and other research-related activities in order to carve out thematic focal areas. 3 To avoid potentially confusing and contradictory messages, and because the focal points turned out to be successful platforms for research collaboration, we took the decision (in 2010) to discontinue the so-called \"core themes\" of research, which had been defined in 2004 and which played an important role in the 2005 assessment. 12 The initiative focuses on transnational developments at the micro, meso and macro levels of societies, especially in the field of migration, but increasingly also in other fields. There are regular brown bag lunches which attract a lot of attention beyond this core team, and there are close links of the GDI to researchers in all three main programmes (see chapter II.4 for details). There are three distinct reasons for giving the GDI a more accentuated role in the faculty: First, globalisation, migration and other transnational phenomena are highly topical issues in society, and we expect scholarly and societal interest in these topics to grow in the future. Secondly, there are a number of dedicated colleagues in the faculty whose work directly relates to these topics and who have been very active in acquiring external funding and writing top level publications. Our faculty has a tradition of giving ambitious new groups room to develop, and we want to explore the opportunities for sharpening our profile in this area. Thirdly, the faculty has been successful in getting a new MA programme on Globalisation and Development Studies accredited in February 20114, and we want to establish a link between teaching and research programmes in the same way as we do in other parts of the faculty. Apart from the research programmes and their individual focal points there are research centres housed by or associated with the faculty: One is the Centre for Gender and Diversity (CGD) which was originally part of Maastricht University's Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, but became a part of FASoS in 2001 and is currently housed by the Arts, Media and Culture programme.5 A second example is the Maastricht branch of the Virtual Knowledge Studio (M-VKS) which was funded by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) until the end of 2010 and which currently is being merged into the research programme on Science, Technology and Society.6 4 We teach Globalisation and Development issues since 1989, initially in the form of interfaculty modules and since 2004 as a Minor programme on 'Globalisation & Diversity' (3 courses, 30 ects). In 2009, this was changed into a Minor on 'Globalisation & Development' (3 courses, 30 ects). 5 See http://www.genderdiversiteit.nl/ 6 See http://www.fdcw.org/maastrichtvks/ 13 the Sociaal Historisch Centrum voor Limburg (SHCL, Centre for the Social History of Limburg) which is co-funded by the University and the Dutch province of Limburg and has strong personal and intellectual links with the research institute, specifically with the research programme on Politics and Culture in Europe .7 Finally, the faculty is currently starting up a Centre on Urban and Euregional Studies (CUES) with funding from the City of Maastricht and the Dutch province of Limburg and in connection with Maastricht's bid to become European Capital of Culture in 2018. These centres are housed by a research programme (as is the case for the CGD and the M-VKS) or largely function as separate entities also in the physical sense (as in the case for SHCL). Thematically, centres are relatively narrow and therefore they do not define a specific focal point within their area of research. They are usually linked to structures outside of FASoS and are co-funded by some external partner. These partners can be government branches, foundations, or companies.8 These external links often lead to a strong emphasis on valorisation activities. The key goal in the establishment of centres therefore is to open our faculty for collaboration with external partners, to highlight and organise specific research themes of direct societal interest and thus to make our faculty nationally and internationally visible. Defining these various programmes and centres has not led to a separation of the research institute into unconnected entities. There are various areas of overlapping interest and collaboration between the programmes. These shared interests are expressed in joint research projects and academic events, which are explained in part II of this report in more detail.9 Frequently PhD candidates are jointly supervised by researchers from different research programmes. Finally, the way in which the colloquia of the research programmes are organised10 and the joint management of the research institute (see section I.2 below) is intended to facilitate exchange and build links between the research programmes. 7 See http://www.shclimburg.nl/ 8 For example, the SHCL is co-funded between the University and the province of Limburg, while a key position within the CGD was funded by the Opzij foundation. The CUES will be co-funded by the City of Maastricht and the province. 9 See the respective sections \"research environment and embedding\". 10 The colloquia are organised in turn, so that each Wednesday is filled by a meeting of a different programme to which all researchers of the faculty are invited. 14 In terms of the organisation of this self-evaluation, we have chosen to discuss the work of the programmes and the GDI in part II of this report, while the SHCL is presented in a separate section (part IV). This decision is motivated by the fact that the SHCL is the only centre which is truly self-standing and also physically separated from the faculty, while the CGD and M-VKS are nowadays closely integrated into one of the research programmes. This principal decision is also mirrored in the structure of the annexes in part V of this report which show earning and output figures for the three programmes, the GDI and the SHCL separately.11 The picture below gives a schematic overview of the research institute: 11 The output measurement of the CGD is integrated with that of the Arts, Media and Culture programme, while the M-VKS is included in the output measurement of the STS programme. 15 I.2. Development of the faculty 2005-201012 As demonstrated above, our research institute is a dynamic and changing entity. We therefore want to give some further context to our evolution by briefly sketching some significant developments in our faculty in the period 2005 to 2010. The most important of these is the faculty's growth in terms of staff size and disciplinary focus. Most notably, since January 2007 our name is Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences , whereas our former name was Faculty of Arts and Culture. This name change reflects the increasing importance of the research and teaching programmes especially in European Studies. Since 2006, we have grown from four to five academic departments by newly establishing a Department of Political Science, the members of which predominantly belong to the research programme on Politics and Culture in Europe. In quantitative terms, we have grown from 92 academic staff on our payroll on 1 January 2005 to a figure of 141 by 31 December 2010.13 One important reason for this growth is the increasing number of students following one of the two Bachelor or the 10 Master programmes housed by our faculty.14 Another important reason is the growth of our income from external research funding through which we could create a considerable number of PhD and postdoc positions at our faculty. We see it as a sign of the vitality and the viability of our research programmes that these young colleagues were seamlessly integrated into the research institute and nowadays contribute significantly to our research effort. 12 This and the next section on the management of the research institute do not follow the structure of the self-evaluation report as suggested by the SEP. We nevertheless felt it is necessary to give some context to the developments and policies described below through both these chapters. In order not to inflate the report too much, we have therefore abandoned an extra section on the \"viability\" of the research institute. We consider viability to be a product of the general policies that we pursue and the performance of our research institute, as explained in various chapters of part I. 13 These figures include part-time appointments, full-time lecturers and PhD candidates. 14 Growth was most spectacular in the BA and MA European Studies which were in their second year of operation at the end of the last assessment period and together housed some 400 students then. In the academic year 2010/11, 1.006 students are enrolled in the three-year BA European Studies and about 130 in the various European Studies masters. There was also significant growth in the BA Arts and Culture, especially because of the introduction of an English track (BA admission grew from 80 to 190) and in most of the other MA programmes in Arts and Culture. 16 Chart 1: Growth of academic staff, 2005-2010 (absolute numbers) The growth of staff numbers has contributed significantly to the internatio- nalisation of the faculty. About 40% of our academic staff does not come from the Netherlands. The greater part of the internationals comes from Western European and increasingly also from Central and Eastern European countries - especially our Bulgarian community is notable. We also have colleagues who were born in the United States of America, in Palestine, in India, Australia or in South Korea. This internationalisation of the faculty naturally has resulted in the general use of the English language in our faculty, especially in the research colloquia and the teaching programmes, but also in the daily exchanges on the corridors. 17 Chart 2: Composition of staff by country of origin, 31 December 2010 (absolute numbers) There were some notable changes at the level of professors and associate professors during the evaluation period. In 2008 Valentina Mazzucato was appointed as a professor of Globalisation and Development. In the area of European Studies Thomas Christiansen was appointed on a chair in European Institutional Politics in the same year. Through a new faculty initiative on creating more chairs for well qualified female associate professors15, Sophie Vanhoonacker was offered a special chair in Administrative Governance, and was promoted to a full professor position in 2010. Other female associate professors who participated in this programme since 2006 are: Mineke Bosch (she left the faculty in 2008 for a full chair at Groningen University), Karin Bijsterveld (she became a full professor of Science, Technology & Modern Culture in 2009) and Renee van de Vall, who holds a special chair in Arts and Media since 2009. Two further key appointments for the faculty are first, the arrival of Tsjalling Swierstra as a Professor of Philosophy (2010) who takes a close interest in science and technology issues and technomorality. Second, the Faculty has created a second chair in History, focusing on Global and European 15 See the memo Meer Vrouwelijke Hoogleraren in de Faculteit Cultuurwetenschappen (2006), available in annex L.3. 18 History. Kiran Patel will fill this chair starting September 2011. Jan Nederveen Pieterse accepted a part-time chair in Globalisation Studies which strengthens our teaching and research in Globalisation and Development. We also lost one full professor, Louk de la Rive Box, who became Dean of the International Institute for Social Studies in The Hague. In the special chair section we established new special chairs in Risk Governance (Marjolein van Asselt), Digital Cultures (Sally Wyatt, with the Virtual Knowledge Studio Amsterdam and the KNAW), Reformatory Philosophy (Maarten Verkerk, with the Stichting voor de Statistiek ), European Institutions (Michael Shackleton) and Cultural and Urban Development (Graeme Evans, with the Municipality of Maastricht). At the same time we lost a special chair in Monument Protection (chairholder Marieke Kuipers accepted a position in Delft), in Women Studies (Mineke Bosch) and in art history (Rob Zwijnenberg). Externally hired new associate professors are Ulrike Brunotte (Gender Studies), Thomas Conzelmann (International Relations), Andreas Fickers (Comparative Media History), and Amanda Kluveld (Arts and Culture). Internal promotions to the rank of associate professor between 2005 and 2010 concerned Pieter Calj\u00e9 (Political Culture), Christine Neuhold (European Governance), and Maarten Vink (European Studies). Another element of the faculty's expansion and its strengthened research profile is the establishment of the faculty's Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences in 2007 and its rapid and continued growth since then. Starting with 5 candidates in 2007, the Graduate School housed more than 40 PhD candidates at the end of 2010, and we want it to grow further to a size of about 60 PhD candidates in a steady state. The Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences is discussed in a separate section of this self-study (part III), not least to emphasize the importance we attach to the operation of our Graduate School. 19 I.3. Management of the research institute The Research Institute unites the research being done in the programmes and centres of the faculty in a common organisational framework. A director who also acts as the Associate Dean of Research leads the Research Institute,16 while the heads of the research programmes and centres17 are responsible for the management of their entities. They are assisted and advised by a core team of senior staff who represent the several research themes within the programme. The main coordinating body of the research institute is the Overleg Team Onderzoek18 (OTO) in which the heads of the three existing research programmes, the research director and a representative of the PhD candidates meet and share the responsibility for the daily affairs of the research institute and for the pursuit of its common vision. The OTO's task is to advise the Faculty Board19 on issues such as the strategic direction of research, on the distribution of faculty funds for research,20 or on the selection of PhD candidates for faculty- funded positions in the Graduate School. These advices are almost always endorsed by the Faculty Board. The HRM aspects of the research institute are dealt with by the academic departments (History, Literature & Art, Political Science, Philosophy, and Technology & Society Studies) of the faculty jointly with the Faculty Board. For example, the decision on whether a staff member can go on a sabbatical or receives a reduction of her or his teaching duties is decided by the heads of the five disciplinary departments and, to the extent that the faculty gives financial support for the sabbatical, by the Faculty Board. Coordination between the research programmes and the departments is facilitated by the fact that the 16 This function is currently executed by Thomas Conzelmann (since 2009). The previous research director was Rein de Wilde (since 2005). 17 The following individuals have leadership functions in the research programmes and centres: Tannelie Blom chairs the PCE programme, programme and Maaike Meijer the AMC programme (since 2009, succeeding Lies Wesseling). The GDI is chaired by Valentina Mazzucato, the M-VKS by Sally Wyatt and the SHCL by Ad Knotter. 18 English: Advisory Team for Research. 19 The Dean of FASoS is Rein de Wilde. Further members of the Board are the Associate Deans for Research, for Teaching and for Internationalization (A. Swinnen), the Managing Director of the faculty (A. Koehorst) and a student representative (J. Holz). 20 The faculty has a specific \"Research Stimulation Fund\" which offers seed money for organising workshops, for undertaking research trips or for preparing high profile publications. See annex M.4 for more information. 20 functions of research programme leader and head of academic department are often executed by the same person.21 I.4. Staff composition and finances Except for junior lecturer positions, our staff have a certain portion of guaranteed research time as part of their contract. The standard ratio is 0.2 fte (one day per week) for starting positions and 0.4 fte (two days per week) for more senior functions.22 All academic staff of FASoS with at least 0.2 fte research time (in total 123 of the 141 staff members) are members of the research institute. The individual staff members are at the same time members of disciplinary departments the membership of which is not congruent with specific research groups (Table 1). Table 1: Researchers, departments and programmes (Matrix structure), 31 December 2010 PCE STS AMC GDI History X (9) X (7) X (5) Philosophy X (7) X (9) X (1) Technology & Society Studies X (1) X (24) X (7) Literature & Art X (1) X (24) X (1) Politics X (26) X (1) As Table 1 shows, members of the History department Department participate in all three research programmes in rather equal numbers, while the members of the Philosophy Department spread evenly across the STS and the AMC programme. One member also belongs to the GDI. The members of the Technology & Society Studies (TSS) Department are mostly members of the STS research programme (including the M-VKS) or the Globalisation and Development Initiative. Members of the Literature & Art Department concentrate in the AMC programme, which also houses the Centre for Gender and Diversity. Both the Literature & Art and the TSS Departments are themselves multidisciplinary, i.e. composed by 21 Wiebe Bijker chairs both the STS research programme and department. Tannelie Blom is leader of the PCE research programme and was also head of the political science department until 2010. Maaike Meijer is both chair of the AMC programme and of the Centre for Gender and Diversity. 22 Fte is an acronym for full time employment. 0,4 fte research time means that the respective staff member devotes 60 per cent of her or his time to teaching and administrative tasks, and 40 per cent to research. 21 members with a huge variety of disciplinary backgrounds. A certain disciplinary orientation exists in the PCE programme because of the fact that almost all political scientists belong to PCE. They are however joined in the programme by members of the TSS and the History Departments. The research time available for the faculty has grown almost continuously over the period 2005-2010. This is an expression of our increasing successes in bringing in externally funded research projects as well as of the growth of our faculty in general which was described above. On 31 December 2010 FASoS had a total amount of 67.8 fte of research time (see Table 2). This figure represents the total amount of time which all members of the research institute (123) have reserved for research in their contracts. Until 2007, tenured staff23 always accounted for more than half of the research fte, while since 2008 the ratio was below 50 per cent and currently accounts for 41 per cent of total research time. This decline has been mirrored by a continuous growth of research time represented by PhD candidates (from around 25% in 2005 to 42% in 2010). The research fte which are apportioned to non-tenured staff24 has also grown steadily from 2007 (from 3.8 to 10.3 fte). This growth is explained by the intake of young staff members who are also given research time in their contracts. Table 2: Research staff 2005-2010 in fte* 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Tenured staff 19.6 20.2 21.1 21.9 24.5 25.2 Non-tenured staff 6.4 3.9 3.8 6.5 7.7 10.3 PhD candidates 15.2 13.7 14.4 17.3 23.4 25.9 Additional research time 0.9 1.7 2.8 4.2 5.7 6.4 Total research fte 42.1 39.5 42.1 49.9 61.3 67.8 Support staff 0.8 0.8 0.8 1.2 2.0 2.0 Total staff 42.9 40.3 42.9 51.1 63.3 69.8 * On 31 December of the year concerned 23 This comprises professors and associate professors as well as some of the assistant professors. 24 Lecturers or assistant professors who hold a PhD and have research time (some of them on tenure-track positions) and postdoctoral researchers. The faculty also has junior lecturers among its academic staff who do not hold a PhD and who devote their entire working time to teaching. The figures in table 1 are therefore not representative of the overall staff composition of the faculty. 22 Apart from the research time that our staff members have as part of their work contracts, there are possibilities for temporarily increasing one's research time through three distinct instruments (see entry additional research time in table 2): The first is the acquisition of external research funds for doing own research. Many grants award research time for the applicant her- or himself. During the assessment period staff members used these funds on top of the research time funded by the faculty,25 i.e. we did not use income from external research funds to substitute for our own expenses on research time. We want to put our researchers into a position where acquired research money means additional time for research and in this way also want to give an incentive for levering in external funding.26 The second possibility to increase one's research time is through sabbaticals which the faculty together with the departments finances for staff members. Sabbaticals typically have a volume of between 150 and 300 working hours (equalling roughly 0.1 to 0.2 fte on a yearly basis) and have to be linked to academic output which will increase the academic reputation of the faculty (such as a high profile publication or an external funding application). Since September 2008, the moment we introduced this policy, most departments were able to grant on average two of their staff members such a sabbatical each academic year. Third, since 2006 almost all newly appointed full and associate professors were offered a contract in which their research time was extended by 0.2 fte. This extension is granted for a limited number of years and is linked to another new element in their contract: they are expected to acquire external research funding of at least \u20ac 50,000,- per year on average. We have also seen growth of fte of the support staff for research. These positions are filled by a policy officer for research, a research secretary helping with administrative issues and a grant advisor working for 0.4 fte for FASoS.27 The faculty funds these positions in order to secure professional management of the research institute and to help staff to bring in research funding and to make most of their research time. The grant advisor continuously monitors funding opportunities, organises training classes and helps with administrative issues in 25 Exceptions exist for consultancy work. 26 A second reason for this policy is that some funding organisations make it a condition of grant that research money is used in addition to existing research funds paid by the receiving institution. 27 These functions are currently fulfilled by Patrick van Eijs (policy officer), Merle Achten (grant advisor), and Lidwien Hollanders (research secretary). 23 writing funding applications. The secretary helps with the organisation of workshops and conferences and takes care of the faculty's research website among other things. The policy officer supports the research director with administrative issues and acts as the principal link of the faculty to the central level and to other faculties regarding research policies. Concerning the finances of the research institute, we deal with its income below (under earning capacity). As regards expenditures, they are composed of the salaries accruing to research ftes and a portion of the overall budget of the faculty. While the personnel costs can be easily estimated, it is difficult to isolate the costs of the research institute within the overall budget of the faculty. For example, what is a realistic portion of the building costs or of the costs we have for the university library that relates to research? How much of the salary costs of departmental secretaries or of our marketing and communications department relates to research? As our budgetary system does not differentiate between research and teaching- related expenditure, we have chosen to mention the personnel costs of the research ftes as well as the total expenditure of the faculty in table 2. This gives an impression of the portion of the faculty budget which is spent on (wo)manpower related to research. We also report annual figures on the turnover of the research institute which are further explained in section I.8. ( Earning capacity ) below. The resulting table shows that the research-related turnover of the faculty is growing consistently in relation to total expenditure of the faculty. 24 Table 3: Personnel costs and turnover research institute in relation to total expenditure faculty (in k\u20ac) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Personnel costs for research ftes28 2,482.8 2,414.9 2,602.0 3,077.3 3,793,0 4,262.6 Total below) 3,085.1 2,807.7 3,737.9 5,180.5 16,496.7 18,770.1 Research-related personnel costs as % of total expenditure 20.6 % 19.6 % 18.6 % 20.3 % 23.0 % 22.7% Turnover of research institute as % of total expenditure 25.5% 22.8 % 26.7 % 34.1% 36.6% 34.4% I.5. Research environment and embedding Maastricht University has six faculties, among which FASoS traditionally has been one of the smaller. Because of the growth of the faculty described above, we are nowadays a medium-sized faculty by UM standards. The other faculties of the university with which we have the closest links in teaching and in research are the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences. Some links exist with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences and the School of Business and Economics, but less so with the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience. Relevant Maastricht-based partners outside of the university are the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM), UNU-Merit29, the Arts Schools of the Hogeschool Zuyd , and the Stichting Restauratie Ateliers Limburg. Our national and international links are too numerous to mention. High profile partners are various national research schools (for one of them, the Research School for Science, Technology and Modern Culture - WTMC - Maastricht is the lead institution), universities and research institutes such as the MIT Programme in Science, Technology, and Society, Cornell's Department of Science & 28 These figures are based on research fte, multiplied by standard factors for full time, associate and assistant professors and other staff categories. 29 A part of the United Nations University. 'Merit' stands for Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology. 25 Technology Studies, the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Sussex the universities of Cambridge, Cologne, Leuven, Loughborough and Paris ( Sciences Po), and various other institutions for example in the field of arts (such as the Instituut Collectie Nederland ). It is very common for FASoS staff to stay abroad for a certain period of time (more on this in the programme chapters), while we do not yet see too many visiting scholars coming to FASoS. Within the global marketplace of ideas it is becoming ever more important to give one's own institution a distinctive profile. Apart from the focal point policy discussed above, we also successfully participate in the initiatives by Maastricht University to carve out its own academic identity. Three thematic profile areas called \"Europe and a Globalising world\", \"Learning and Innovation\", and \"Quality of Life\" were recently defined in an attempt to more clearly position Maastricht University at the national and international level. In the first two profile areas FASoS plays a leading and substantial role, while in the third one our role is more limited but essential nevertheless.30 The definition of these profile areas happened in anticipation of possible policies by the current Dutch Government to bundle certain activities and disciplines in specific universities and to give each university a distinctive profile in this way. But there is also a research-related aspect, in that such focal points will be helpful in making the UM an interesting academic partner in specific subject areas through creating the necessary critical mass for collaborative research projects. This latter aspect links with the general tendency at the national as well as the international level to funnel a greater share of research funding to specific thematic priorities. Joint Programming has been implemented on a European level. The first themes were selected in late 2009/early 2010. In this context, the NWO has proposed themes in the fields of societal integration, water and climate change, health and ageing, sustainable energy, and the accessibility of sustainable urban areas. In partnership with NWO the new Dutch ministry of Economics, Agriculture and Innovation (EL&I) has introduced priority areas of research (so-called \"topgebieden\") focusing on issues which mainly fall under the expertise of the natural and technical sciences (such as water, food, gardening, high tech, life sciences, energy, chemicals, and logistics). One further area - creative industries - may offer links to FASoS research, but this as well as 30 See Annex K.4 for further information on this aspect. 26 possible links to the other priority areas still have to be explored by us on the basis of our current research strengths. Paying attention to national funding policies and EU research initiatives is all the more important as the Dutch policy of transferring funds from the so-called 'block grant' for universities to indirect government funding (in the volume of M\u20ac 100 in 2011) is expected to continue. This implies that Dutch universities lose part of their guaranteed funding base, and have to 'earn back' funds in competition with each other. The resulting dynamic in research funding generates new opportunities, but also new threats. FASoS has to find a way to compensate for the loss of direct government funding for research by indirect government funding and other external income. I.6. Quality, scientific relevance and academic reputation The quality and scientific relevance of our research as well as our academic reputation as defined by the SEP is best assessed at the level of the individual programmes and centres. This is where issues such as the originality of ideas and the significance of contributions to specific fields of study can best be demonstrated. We therefore keep this section short by presenting some selected highlights of our research in the period 2005-2010 and show how they have not only made an impact in their specific fields, but have also contributed to the academic reputation of our research institute at the domestic and the international level. Table 4 below gives an overview of some flagship academic projects of our faculty which started during the assessment period and are still ongoing at this moment (also see Table 11 in section I.9 below showing some flagship projects with explicit societal engagement): 27 Table 4: Some academic flagship projects of FASoS, awarded 2005- 2010 Researcher Project Duration Funding C.

Output of the research institute If one looks at the publication output of the research institute over the assessment period, the following picture emerges: Table 5: Publication output 2005-2010 by category31 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Total per category Refereed journal articles 18 15 34 42 38 68 215 Refereed books 2 2 1 4 3 2 14 Refereed book chapters 5 2 10 8 17 23 65 Editorship refereed book 0 0 4 1 3 3 11 Editorship refereed journal 1 1 2 2 0 4 10 Refereed publications (total) 26 20 51 57 61 100 315 Non-refereed journal articles 23 35 26 28 15 18 145 Non-refereed books 3 2 2 6 10 5 28 Non-refereed book chapters 39 60 62 52 67 40 320 Editorship non-refereed journal 2 1 2 3 0 0 8 Editorship non-refereed book 6 9 7 8 8 3 41 Non refereed (total) 73 107 99 97 100 66 542 PhD thesis 1 2 4 4 5 1 17 Professional publications 86 123 115 126 169 186 805 Total per year 186 252 269 284 335 353 Grand total: 1679 One clear trend in Table 5 is the strong increase in the category of refereed32 journal articles (from 18 in 2005 to 68 in 2010) and refereed book chapters (from 5 in 2005 to 23 in 2010), while non-refereed journal articles and non-refereed book chapters decline in importance. All other categories apart from professional publications remain more or less stable over the assessment period. The growth in refereed publications is indicative of a real change, i.e. it is not just a reflection of the growing size of the faculty, as shown in Table 6. 31 We do not include conference presentations here, since we do not collect figures on this kind of output. Media appearances are also not included, but are reported in annex I.2. for each programme. 32 We count publications as refereed when the journal or publisher operates a double blind peer reviewing system and when referee reports can be shown. This measure is a relatively strict one. It would not count as \"peer reviewed\" publications on which the editors of a book or the editorial board of a journal have commented, since the \"double blind\" criterion does not apply in this case. 29 The number of refereed publications per research fte increased considerably over the assessment period. Measured as a percentage of all publications, the number of refereed publications has doubled between 2005 and 2010. Table 6: Publication output 2005-2010 per research fte 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Refereed publications per research fte33 publications as percentage of all publication 14 % 8 % 19 % 20 % 18 % 28 % We believe that these trends are not least a result of faculty incentives to produce international and/or peer reviewed publications. In 2007 we introduced an \"output measurement\" system34 which gives points to different types of publications and puts a relatively high premium on double blind peer reviewed articles in international journals with high impact factors or in journals which have been identified as key fora for the presentation of research being done in the faculty's focal points of research. Each programme has identified a list of (at most 10) such journals, which are mentioned in the programme chapters. An article in such a journal will yield 4 points in the case of a single-authored piece, while a non-refereed journal article only receives 1 point and a double blind peer reviewed article in non-leading journals 2 points. The same goes for peer reviewed book chapters which are worth double the points of a normal (non- reviewed) book chapter. Books are worth 6 points (8 points when published with an internationally leading publishing house.35 The output points play a role when performance agreements for individual staff members are made (a minimum of 10 publication points in 5 years was applied in the early stages of this policy) and will be looked at in assessment interviews, 33 Refereed publications = refereed journal articles, refereed books, and refereed book chapters. The figures in brackets show the values if PhD candidates are excluded. 34 See annex M.3 for more information. 35 The ratio between points for books and for international peer reviewed journal articles are not to be interpreted as a reflection of the amount of time needed to write either one or as an arbitrary reflection of the relative worth of different types of publications, but as a reflection of the importance we attach to increasing the number of international peer reviewed journal articles at this moment in time. 30 especially if a colleague is up for a promotion or for tenure.36 The faculty has made it clear though that there are different ways of making a career at FASoS (for example for excellent teachers) and that the publication points are but one measurement which have to be considered in the qualitative assessment of performance by the heads of department. A high number of professional publications is also distinctive of our research institute. This category includes consultancy papers and working papers, but also shorter interventions in academic contexts (such as book reviews, rebuttals or forum contributions in academic journals) and in the public (for example, op-eds in national newspapers).37 As expressed above, the research institute wants to play a role in national societal debates and therefore considers it relevant to be active in this category. However, since about 50% of our publications are professional, the research institute offers no incentives for the production of professional publications: In the output measurement system described above, only 0,1 points per professional publication are given, and professional publications are not recognised in the promotion policy of the faculty. Another important \"output\" element is the number of PhD defences and the average time that it takes PhD candidates to complete their studies. This aspect is further discussed in part III dealing with the Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences. I.8. Earning capacity The research institute is financed from a variety of sources. In the Netherlands a distinction is made between the \"first money stream\" ( eerste geldstroom ) consisting of basic financing of the universities by the public, the \"second\" money stream (competitive research grants by public funding bodies) and the \"third\" money stream (contract research, but also all competitive research funds from the European Commission and from the ERC). 36 See annexes L.1 and L.2 for further information on the faculty's promotion and tenure track policies. 37 Not included are: Blog entries, contributions to wikis, letters to the editor, and similar written commentaries. 31 Table 7 gives an overview of the various sources of income of the research institute and singles out those parts of our income which are related to our performance as researchers. The figures present turnover, i.e. research income used in the given reference year. We have had a total turnover of 7.24 M\u20ac (2.92 + 4.32 M\u20ac) in research funds from research grants and contract research in the period 2005-2010. On top of this there is 3.96 M\u20ac of turnover from performance-related schemes in direct government funding, bringing the total figure to 11.20 M\u20ac over the assessment period. One can also note a continuous and significant growth of turnover figures over the assessment period, notwithstanding some variation over the years which are due to the termination or the start of larger research projects. This growth is not just an artefact of the growing staff size of the faculty, as shown in Table 8. When we account for the growth in performance-related research income in relation to research ftes, there is an increase from 59.3 k\u20ac per research fte in 2005 up to 83.6 k\u20ac in 2010, or an increase by 41 per cent. Table 7: Income research institute 2005-2010 in k\u20ac (turnover) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 uses an allocation model for distributing public funds among its faculties. The model is based on factors such as enrolments and graduations on the teaching side, and staff size of the faculty, funding successes and successful promotions on the research side. The entries in the table relate to that part of the funding which has a clear link to research, i.e. it does not represent the total income of our faculty from public funds. 39 Within the research-related part of the UM allocation model, there are some instruments which have a clear link to our research performance. Three instruments are included here: the promotion bonus that we receive from the Dutch government for each defended PhD, the \"Earning power\" fund, which is linked to successes in funding, and the so-called \"A status grants\" which are paid out for each research application that is recommended for funding by referees, but in the end is not awarded by the funding institutions because of a lack of funding. 40 Direct funding + Competitive research grants + Contract research 32 Table 8: Performance-related income research institute measured against research ftes, 2005-2010 in k\u20ac (turnover) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Research fte42 26.9 25.8 27.7 32.6 37.9 41.4 Performance related income per research fte 57.4 43.8 55.2 52.6 61.2 71.7 One flaw of the turnover figures is that they represent past performance to a certain extent. Research funds acquired in one year may be spent only two or three years later which is the moment when they appear as turnover in the faculty's budget. The figures in Table 9 therefore show the absolute figures of research income earned in each calendar year.43 Income from the first money stream is excluded here since these incomes are paid out with a certain delay. The figures naturally fluctuate more than those for turnover, but the overall growing tendency regarding performance-related income per research fte remains. In other words, we are in a process of using research time increasingly effectively to acquire external funds. Table 9: Income research institute measured against research ftes, 2005-2010 in k\u20ac (absolute figures) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Research grants (2nd money stream) 628.5 743.2 571.6 1,840.4 research fte 36.3 44.4 84.2 73.4 47.4 56.3 41 Performance related part of Direct funding + All Competitive research grants + All Contract research. 42 Research fte = Tenured staff + non-tenured staff + additional research time.

PhD candidates are excluded here since they are usually not eligible to independently submit research applications. 33 Despite this growth, a remaining concern is that our successes differ across funding schemes and programme lines. For some schemes, we are lagging behind national averages. Chart 3 gives an overview of our success rate in the 7th framework programme of the EU in comparison to other Dutch universities: Chart 3: Success of FASoS in the 7th framework programme, 2007- 2010 Source: Agentschap NL The figures in this table show that we have scored 5 successes in the FP 7 programme between 2007 and mid-2010 (the first period of operation of FP 7). The percentage of successful applications is given in the table on the right hand side of the chart: 1 out of 3 or 33% in \"Environment\", 1 out of 7 (or 14%) in Socio-economic sciences & humanities, and so on. One can note here that we do better than the average of all Dutch universities in the areas of \"environment\" and \"people\" (this latter category includes the two Marie Curie outgoing grants acquired during the first FP 7 period), while our performance in the area \"Socio- Economic & Humanities\" is in line with national averages and weaker in \"capacities\". Overall, in addition to the five projects in the first period of FP 7, 34 we acquired three FP6 projects and one FP 7 (2nd period) grant during the evaluation period.45 A similarly mixed picture emerges concerning the results of our university in those divisions of the NWO which are of the biggest interest to our faculty, namely MaGW ( Maatschappij- en Gedragswetenschappen ; social ( Geesteswetenschappen ; humanities) and WOTRO (Science for Global Development). Chart 4 shows the NWO funding successes of Maastricht University as a whole in relation to the national averages, split up along NWO divisions, and over the years 2006-2010. What one can see here is that in the GW section Maastricht University46 got 16 out of 58 (or 28%) of its applications funded in comparison to a national average of 32%. The figures for MaGW are 16% UM in relation to 18% nationwide, and for WOTRO 43% UM in relation to 45% nationwide. Chart 4: Numbers and percentages of successful NWO applications UM / national, 2006-2010 Source: NWO 45 In FP6 we acquired two projects in Cooperations and one in Life sciences with a total contract value of \u20ac 414.134,-. The total contract value for the five FP7 projects mentioned in chart 3 is \u20ac 991.749,-. The FP7 2nd period grant is for an Initial Training Network coordinated by Maastricht with a total contract value of \u20ac 3.000.000,- of which \u20ac 447.196,- are for FASoS. See annex PCE-G.2 for a full overview. 46 As FASoS is neither a classical humanities faculty nor a faculty which covers all social sciences, it is difficult to produce the same comparative figures at the faculty level. 35 One has to be cautious in interpreting these figures. The bulk of GW submissions come from FASoS, with the rest from smaller research groups in other faculties. In the MaGW section, FASoS plays a less relevant role due to the many applications coming from the School of Business and Economics and the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience of Maastricht University. One can also see from the 16/18% results in MaGW that in comparison to other divisions it is more difficult to receive funding in MaGW, which, unfortunately, is the section to which almost all applications from the PCE group and a good portion of the STS applications have to go. In WOTRO the same picture emerges. If one looks at the prestigious Innovational Research Incentive Scheme (Vernieuwingsimpuls ) of the NWO,47 one can see that the figures are 19/20% for GW, 14/16% for MaGW and 0/23% for WOTRO (Chart 5). While researchers who currently work at FASoS received 2 VENI grants48 and 1 VICI grant in the GW section in this period, we did not score in the MaGW and WOTRO sections. 47 This is a funding instrument which funds individual research projects for postdoctoral researchers (VENI, up to \u20ac 200.000,-), for research groups led by mid-career academics (VIDI, up to \u20ac 800.000,-) and for research groups led by established researchers (VICI, up to \u20ac 1.500.000,-). Successes in this instrument have become an important benchmark in the Netherlands for the scientific reputation of departments as well as individual researchers. Submissions are assessed by panels which are formed in the different domains (MaGW, GW) mentioned above and in one \"interdivisional\" panel. 48 However, one of the two VENI grants was acquired when the applicant was still working at another university. 36 Chart 5: Numbers and percentages of successful Innovational Research Incentive Scheme applications UM/national, 2006- 2010 Source: NWO If one compares these figures against university-wide and national averages, one can see that we are facing difficulties especially in the VENI and the VIDI classes of the Innovational Research Incentive Scheme to get proposals funded (Table 10). On the other hand, our faculty has acquired a major VICI grant (K. Bijsterveld), and has also been successful in other areas of NWO funding. We scored a number of successes in the Open Competition rounds of MaGW and especially GW, have brought in huge WOTRO subsidies (W. Bijker, V. Mazzucato) and have also been successful in Internationalisation Grants, Replacement Subsidies, and various thematic competitions. We were also successful with two grants in the NORFACE and the Open Research Area competitions (V. Mazzucato, T. Christiansen).

Source: Maastricht University Office 37 There are a number of explanations for the uneven performance of our faculty in gaining research funds. As explained above, one reason for these difficulties is that many of our applications to this scheme have to be channelled to the NWO's section on social and behavioural sciences (MaGW). Here we have to compete with disciplines such as economics and psychology which may be better able to relate to certain methodological paradigms viewed favourably within this NWO section.49 Another reason may be our reputation as a young and teaching- oriented university and faculty which is not conducive to the UM's general success rate at NWO when compared with national averages (Table 10). Yet, these reasons are difficult to substantiate and, more importantly, should not be a reason for giving up on our efforts at bringing in more research money also from the Innovational Research Incentive Scheme. We therefore have developed a number of policies to keep and where possible to increase our earning capacity; especially by giving support to yet less experienced colleagues: x Scouting and coaching : Promising researchers among our staff are identified and are supported in a number of ways (most important tools are the reduction of teaching duties, coaching by a senior colleague, payment of course \"Acquisition power\" financed by the central level, language editing where necessary).50 The faculty has itself given a clear policy on how identified 'high potentials' are supported and defined a trajectory for research proposals to make sure that each proposal that leaves the faculty is of the best possible quality. x Expertise panel : Each applicant has to discuss her or his application with the research institute's expertise panel which is composed of four senior and experienced51 researchers from the various parts of the faculty. The panel gives feedback, checks on comprehensibility of the proposal from a non-disciplinary perspective, and may advise against the submission of proposals which are considered too weak to stand a chance for funding. If a proposal makes it to the interview round of competitive funding schemes, candidates are coached with a mock interview by the expertise panel. 49 A recent survey of the Netherlands Institute of Government revealed that of the 113 political and administrative science applications submitted in the Innovational Research Incentive Scheme only 4 were awarded in the period between 2004 and 2009. This measures up to a success rate of about 3,5 per cent - about 5 \u00bd times lower than the national average for MaGW (19,8%) during this period. 50 See annex M.1 for more information. 51 The current members of the expertise panel are Andreas Fickers, Christine Neuhold, Nico Randeraad (chair), and Renee van de Vall. These colleagues have successfully acquired funding in the second and third money stream and most of them have been members of NWO or other evaluation committees themselves. See annex M.2 for an overview of members and procedures. 38 x Grant advisor : Applicants are supported by the faculty's grant advisor who helps with identifying the right funding schemes for specific needs and with technical issues (such as putting together the budget). Moreover, since 2010 the grant advisor puts together coaching classes for all FASoS applicants in specific funding schemes (currently tried out for Marie Curie grants and applicants to the VENI funds in the NWO Innovational Research Incentive Scheme). x Incentives : Applicants receive a small bonus from the faculty to their personal budget. We also give points for successful grant applications in the output measurement system described in chapter I.7 above. Until the end of 2010, this policy was topped up by the Central Board which gave a generous bonus for proposals which were recommended for funding by selection committees but which eventually could not be awarded because of a lack of funds. x Recruitment policies : The track record in acquiring research funding is an important consideration when hiring applicants for open positions (especially the more senior ones) at our faculty. As Table 7 shows, we were successful in levering in substantial funding from various 2nd and the 3rd money stream sources over the assessment period. We will continue with existing policies in this area while regularly reviewing their effectiveness and ways for further improvement (such as the coaching classes mentioned above). We are optimistic that we can further improve our success rate in procuring external funding in the years to come. Apart from increasing our efforts to bring in research grants from indirect government funding, we also see growth potential in income from the third money stream (consultancy, but also income from funding programmes administered by the European Commission and the ERC). This orientation also matches well with our ambition to research questions and issues in which society at large is interested (as expressed in consultancy bids for tender). We also expect more income through the financial rewards for completed PhD degrees and the more regular asking of tuition fees from external PhD candidates. I.9. Societal relevance: quality, impact and valorisation As a research institute of arts and social sciences, our main contributions to society are in the form of written and oral comment on societal processes and in the training of academics who are able to make an impact within society qua their ability to critically analyse the world around them (on the latter, see chapter I.10. 39 'Next generation' below).52 A few examples may illustrate the way in which our researchers engaged with societal issues during the assessment period (Table 11):53 Concerning practical ways of making our research relevant to and known in society , we employ a number of strategies. One important aspect are consultancy projects which answer to a specific need for better knowledge as defined by a societal stakeholder. These are usually disseminated in meetings with focus groups and in publicly available research reports (see examples in table 9 above). Our research staff frequently write classroom books and other books which are directed at and well received by a larger public.54 Professional publications (a certain portion of which are op-eds or short research-based interventions in academic journals and in national newspapers) also play a great role.55 Our staff members are also regularly requested to be available for interviews for non-academic audiences and some of them are a member in prestigious scientific advisory bodies such as the Health Council of the Netherlands (W. Bijker) or the (Dutch) Scientific Council for Government Policy (M. van Asselt). Finally, the workshops and sometimes exhibitions or public readings in which we present our research are relevant. It is common practice within FASoS to invite practitioners to these workshops to give keynote lectures or to comment on the research results we achieve.56 52 This section follows the \"Handreiking Evaluatie van maatschappelijke relevantie van wetenschappelijk onderzoek\" formulated by the ERiC project. For further information, see http://www.nwo.nl/files.nsf/pages/NWOP_83CECZ/$file/Handreiking%20ERiC.pdf 53 As demanded by the SEP, we also have put together a number of quantitative and qualitative indicators of \"valorisation\" which are presented in annexes in part V. The measures included are a) an overview of acquired funding from the 3rd money stream of more than \u20ac 10.000,- per activity - annexes G.2; b) professional publications (annexes F.1 for numbers and annexes J. for the full list); c) advisory or consultancy roles in non-academic bodies (annexes I.1); and d) interviews and other public appearances for non-academic audiences (annexes I.2.). 54 Some examples are: K.

The scope of African migration to Europe and its consequences both for the countries of origin and the destination countries are poorly understood. The MAFE project collects and disseminates unique data on the characteristics and behaviour of migrants from Africa to Europe. Policy makers are provided with a better understanding of the changing patterns of African migration to Europe; the determinants of this migration, and of return and circulation of migrants; as well as the socio-economic and demographic changes that result from international migration. The research institute's webpage has been a weak spot in terms of presentation of research to the outside world. The problems were partly related to the inflexibility of the web presence offered by the central level of the UM which gave 41 us little control over the way in which we present web content and offered limited technical support. Since the end of 2010 we have been busy with the help of an external consultant to develop a new web presence which offers a dynamic and interactive way of presenting ourselves to the outside world. In the course of spring and summer 2011 the web page is being fundamentally redesigned and made a much more accessible, interesting and user-friendly tool. I.10. Next generation As explained above, we see an important part of our role in society in the training of future academic generations - be they (research) Master students, PhD candidates or postdoctoral researchers. In this section, we focus on the ways in which we promote postdoctoral talent and in which we integrate research and teaching in the MA study tracks. The PhD training in our Graduate School is discussed in a separate section (part III) of this report. Postdocs: Through the Graduate School training our PhD candidates are trained well in academic and 'soft' skills which will help them to become successful postdoctoral researchers or continue with a job outside of the academic world. Yet, the years after finishing the PhD are often a difficult and challenging time for young researchers. The faculty has developed a number of ' postdoc policies' by which we want to help our young talents to successfully make the transition from PhD candidate to independent and successful researchers: x Employment : We offer successful PhD candidates a limited number of positions at the faculty, either as lecturers with research time or in the context of research projects. So far we have been successful to keep promising academic talent at our faculty which we also see as a confirmation of the stimulating intellectual environment our faculty offers. x Tenure track policy : Staff members who have worked as postdoctoral researchers or as lecturers can apply for a tenure track position leading to the rank of assistant professor.57 The faculty board decides each year on a certain number of tenure track positions (in the past years three positions), depending on the financial possibilities of the faculty. In order to be admitted, candidates have to prove that they can relate to the research programmes and centres that we have in house, have to have a certain number of publications (at least two international peer reviewed articles) and have to fulfil a number of teaching-related criteria. Admission 57 See annex L.2 for more information on the faculty's tenure track policy. 42 to a tenure track position implies that staff members can get a permanent contract at our faculty after three years and after successful evaluation of their research and teaching performance. x Research related support : An important element in the qualification as independent researcher is being able to bring in externally acquired research funds. The leaders of the academic departments and of the research programmes and centres once a year identify those young colleagues who qua their CVs and their research performance stand a good chance of scoring in a competitive research funding scheme (such as a VENI grant in the NWO's Innovational Research Incentive scheme). These candidates are supported by a number of measures such as mini- sabbaticals in the time they write their research application, a senior staff member acting as coach and a course on \"acquisition power\" organised by the UM's Kenniscentrum Contractonderzoek . In addition, the other support measures discussed in section I.8. above are available. x Integration of research and teaching : The faculty currently has two research Master programmes . One is the Cultures of Art, Science and Technology (CAST) Research Master which was launched in 2005 and has since been evaluated and accredited twice, the last time in 2011. The other more recent initiative (launched in 2009) is the Research Master in European Studies (RMES). CAST is a two-year Master programme designed to train young academics to do research at the crossroads of three important spheres of modern culture: science, technology and the arts. CAST builds on the two research programmes STS and AMC. The central tenet of CAST is that science (including the humanities and social sciences), technology (in its material forms and as a discipline) and the arts (both in elite and popular expressions) are such pervasive constituents of highly developed societies, that our modern culture can only be understood when these key roles are recognised and explicitly studied. The programme has a yearly intake of 8-12 students. About half of the graduates now have a PhD scholarship, one quarter has other scientific jobs, and one quarter is doing other work or searching. CAST alumni report that they find themselves well equipped for their researcher's life.58 58 Koen Beumer, then working at the Advisory Council for Science and Technology Policy (AWT), summarized his experiences in an interview with the UM newspaper Observant , October 9, 2009: \"I experience huge benefits of my CAST education, ranging from trivial things such as adequate knowledge to skills such as being able to write well. I also notice differences with people who have not done a research master. I often evaluate the research and knowledge claims that we [at AWT] receive more critically\" (unauthorized own translation). 43 The CAST international reviewers commented in 2011: \"The CAST Programme, in its relatively brief lifespan, has evolved into one of excellence and significance. It offers a distinctive and indeed unique approach with its emphasis on STS and the arts.\" The 2-year interdisciplinary Research Master European Studies (RMES) aims at training young academics to do research into the process of European integration and into the European Union's institutions, politics and administrative characteristics. While allowing for different specialisations, the programme is based on the assumption that the study of theoretical, normative and empirical questions related to European integration must reflect the different contexts of this process - historical and cultural contexts as well as the international, if not 'global' context of EU policy-making. The goal of the programme is to equip future PhD candidates and analysts with a broad range of scientific methods and approaches relevant to the analysis of European phenomena, while at the same time instilling a critical attitude to the concepts and approaches handed down by the traditional social and cultural sciences. The RMES has a strong emphasis on methodology and techniques of research and on doing research by students themselves. Its curriculum is closely integrated with the PCE research activities. Except the 4-weeks 'introductory' module on the state of the art in European Studies, each module is based on the current research of the respective module coordinator and comprises a research project, to be carried out by students individually or in small teams. The research methods and skills that are part of the curriculum range from the design of quantitative and qualitative research to statistical analysis and historical source criticism, from discourse analysis and game theory, to interview techniques and academic writing. The RMES was accredited by the Dutch Accreditation Organisation and by the Ministry of Education in 2009 and started in September that year with 3 students. In its current (second) year it serves 8 students. Since the focus in both Masters is on doing own research from the start of year 1, it is easy to identify promising research talents and to help them develop into successful researchers. All Research Master students are also invited to the weekly colloquia of the research programmes. The courses developed for the Research Masters have also proven to be attractive for some specific training needs of PhD candidates in the Graduate School. This is one of the reasons why there will be a closer integration of the Research Masters into the graduate school in the future (see part III). 44 Since 2006 the faculty runs a joint Honours Programme for both Bachelor programmes (Arts & Culture, European Studies). Students are selected after their first year on the basis a motivation letter and their performance in their freshman year (successful candidates are among the best 5% of their cohort in terms of GPA). In their second and third year honours students participate in intensive research based seminars (of five students at most) organised by FASoS professors. Maastricht University as a whole and FASoS as part of UM have also successfully used the so called MARBLE59 projects in which third year Bachelor students work with staff members of FASoS on specific research projects. Students have to apply to be accepted into one of these courses (belonging to the best 25% of their cohort in terms of GPA) and will only be admitted on the basis of above average grades and the absence of any study delay. MARBLE projects have a strong link with ongoing research at the faculty and have included, among others, projects on European Capitals of Culture , on EU External Relations , on Innovation, Trade and Uncertain Risks and on the History of the Pietersberg (a limestone hill south of the city which features quarries and an extensive cave system continuing into Belgium which was used both as a wartime shelter, as a home of military headquarters during WW II and as a wine cellar). Experience shows that many students who participated in a MARBLE course are inspired to choose a Research Master as the next step of their academic career. 59 Maastricht Research Based Learning (or MARBLE) is Maastricht University's project on Research-Based Learning (RBL) in the Bachelor programme. Partially financed by a subsidy from the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (the Sirius Programme), the objective of MARBLE is to stimulate excellence in Higher Education by involving small groups of students in research projects. 45 I.11. SWOT analysis Strengths (What are we good at?) Weaknesses (Where should we do better?) x Continuous growth in peer reviewed and international publications. x Clearly focused research programmes which at the same time leave space for individual initiatives and interests. x Increased intake of graduate school and balanced relationship between tenured staff and PhD candidates. x Two well received and internatio- nally visible Research Masters, close integration of teaching and research. x Strong administrative support for preparing and managing external grants. x Able to hire and to keep high-profile senior and promising junior academic staff x Our success rate in bringing in external research funding falls behind for some funding instruments, especially in the NWO Innovational Research Incentive Scheme. x We underutilize the 'instrument' of visiting professors / scholars. x Our web visibility has been weak in the past. Opportunities (what chances do we have for improvement?) Threats (which developments might threaten us?) x Interdisciplinarity is more and more demanded in research grants and funding institutions. By means of the nature of our faculty, we can respond to this criterion well, but should use our potential more fully. x International contacts at the individual level can be intensified and used for developing more formal international contacts. x Thriving group of researchers on Globalisation and Development. x To combine our strong profile / reputation in teaching (\"leading in learning\") with world-class research x The tendency in national policy to divert funding from the first to the second and the third money streams is continuing. This requires ever more effort to keep an adequate level of resources. x How can continued growth be managed? 46 I.12. Strategy The faculty has recently revisited its strategic orientation and long term goals and has formulated a strategy covering the period 2011-2015.60 The overall motto of the strategy is \"focused growth\", implying that after the years of a rapid increase of student and staff members we see a period of consolidation before us now. For the research side of the faculty, a number of key strategic priorities were formulated. They seek to respond to the SWOT table above: How can we preserve our strengths and address our weaknesses; how can we use opportunities and deal with the threats? x Promoting and rewarding high-quality research: As explained above, the faculty knows a number of incentive and bonus instruments to enable and facilitate promising research ideas. While this general policy will be continued, we will review the effectiveness and goal-directedness of existing instruments. We also want to develop policies to encourage colleagues who use their research time less effectively when compared with the research institute's average output figures per research fte. We will do our best to continue with an adequate level of seed funding for new research initiatives by the research programmes and centres. x Increasing external funding of our research: We aim at improving our income from the second and the third money streams, so that by 2015 a substantial portion of the research time of our staff is funded from external sources of income. The various support, coaching and incentive policies discussed above are an important element in this respect. x Managing growth in the Graduate School: This priority is a reflection of the rapid growth of the graduate school during the assessment period. At the same time we want to continue on the path of bringing down the average duration of our PhD trajectories and want to increase the number of PhD degrees we award. These ambitions are further discussed in part III below. x Sharpening our research and keeping in touch with new developments: We want to continue with the focal point policy while preventing that the focal points ossify and become tied to disciplinary research interests. We will internally review the focal points after five years of operation (i.e. in 2013) and will make the necessary adaptations. It is in the nature of things that we cannot envisage how our focus will change. The one big change that is currently beginning to take shape is the promotion of the Globalisation and Development Initiative into a fourth research programme. 60 \"FASoS Coming of Age - Strategic Plan Faculty Arts and Social Sciences at Maastricht University\", available in annex K.2. Research issues are covered in section 6 of this report. 47 x Effective communication: In the course of spring and summer 2011 our web page is being fundamentally redesigned and made a much more accessible, interesting and user-friendly tool. I.13. Benchmarks Apart from the more qualitative targets discussed above, the faculty has set itself a number of quantitative benchmarks which we want to achieve by 2015: x We aim at an output of two refereed publications per year and research fte in all research programmes and centres (including PhD candidates), and at three refereed publications per year and research fte if the PhD candidates are excluded. This output should be reached as an average over the period 2011-2015. x Success rate in the NWO Vernieuwingsimpuls and in other funding schemes of similar standing (e.g. ERC Starter or Advanced grants) equal Dutch averages. x 20% of our yearly income is generated through indirect government funding and contract research. In addition to scoring in NWO programmes, a substantial portion of this income is generated through European grants. x This income leads to at least 10 new PhD projects per annum in our GS. On top of this, we have positions funded by the faculty's own resources and external PhDs, so that we can aim for one PhD promotion per year per full-time professor on average (about 15 p.a., including external PhD candidates). 48 49 Part II: The research programmes II.1 Research Programme \"Politics and Culture in Europe\" (PCE) 1. Objectives and research area The research programme on Politics and Culture in Europe (PCE) is an interdisciplinary programme that seeks to understand and explain the process of European integration and its political, institutional and ideational characteristics. It does so by taking into account the historical and cultural contexts as well as the international, if not 'global' context of EU policy making. This concern for political as well as historical, cultural and extra-European/global factors is evidenced by the research that is done within PCE. It ranges from reflections on the history and nature of the EU polity with a view to its democratic credentials, to the empirical and theoretical analysis of 'Europeanisation' processes; from research on the EU's foreign and security policy to the study of Euroscepticism in its different guises; from a scrutiny of administrative cultures and bureaucratic politics at national as well as at supranational level, to historical research on the constitutive role of statistics for state and polity building. Clearly, PCE spans a broad range of themes, subjects and approaches. As PCE developed and grew into a collective of about 30 (mostly young) researchers, we had to think how to make use of the innovative ideas and methods within our group while at the same time accommodating the need and demand61 to lend more focus to the 'mass' of 'European' research at the FASoS. The focal point policy described in more detail in part I.1. of this report led to the development of the focal point Administrative Governance in our programme . This focal point focuses on the bureaucratic organisations established by sovereign nation states to facilitate trans- and supranational policy coordination and integration, which have also become politically meaningful actors in their own right. Of particular interest are questions concerning the historical genesis and development of such trans- and supranational bureaucracies and, related to that, 61 For example by the 2005 accreditation committee. 50 the conditions under which civil servants working in or with such bureaucracies are able to exert substantial influence on the content, scope and execution of decisions and policies which formally result from negotiations among democratically elected political actors. Apart from the (multi-layered) administrative structures of the European Union, we also examine the historical role of bureaucracies in the development of modern nation states, and the role and functions of domestic and supranational bureaucracies in the emerging system of global governance. The focal point Administrative Governance encompasses three overlapping research themes62 each coordinated by a senior staff member. Together with Prof. Dr. T. Blom (general management) these three staff members form the focal point's management group. Research theme 1: The Administrative Governance of European Public Policy- making is coordinated by Prof. Dr. T. Christiansen and focuses on administrative players and procedures in the making of European public policies. This implies attention to both the role of the European and national administrations in the EU policy-process, as well as to the interaction between administrative and other logics (e.g. representative, participatory and diplomatic). Beyond empirical research into these processes and mechanisms, this research theme also pays explicit attention to the normative aspects of administrative governance, in particular the degree to which public administration in the EU meets key criteria of accountability and transparency. PCE members contributing to this research line work on subjects such as the role of bureaucratic actors in the reconciliation procedure between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament; the regulatory impact of European agencies taken as information processors; the procedures and mechanisms of domestic implementation and enforcement of supranational legislation; the role of national and EU civil servants in policy fields covered by the Open Method of Coordination and similar peer review systems in other international organisations such as the OECD, the WTO, or the United Nations; the influence of member state bureaucracies on the practical execution of EU migration and asylum policies; and the interplay between formal and informal governance in the EU. Research theme 2: The Administrative Governance of Multilateral Foreign Policy is coordinated by Prof. Dr. S. Vanhoonacker and departs from the observation that 62 As in the other research programmes of FASoS, these themes do not divide the research programmes into separate groups. Research projects may run across several of the labels and an event organised by one group will usually involve other researchers of PCE (and the other research programmes) as well. 51 traditionally processes of foreign policy formulation have been supported by diplomatic services based in the national ministries of foreign affairs and national embassies in foreign countries. An important new development is the growing importance of multilateral forms of diplomacy and foreign policy cooperation through regional and international organisations. Within the EU as one of the most advanced and complex forms of foreign policy cooperation we witness the creation of a whole range of new Brussels-based structures which also affect in an important way national foreign policy administrations. PCE members contributing to this research line are working, inter alia, on subjects such as the role of the Council Secretariat in the formulation and implementation of the European Security and Defence Policy; the impact of the European Neighbourhood Policies on the administrative systems of countries like Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus; the EU's diplomatic relations with other international organisations; the emergent EU role in the field of crisis management and the development of the European External Action Service in the wake of the Lisbon Treaty. Research theme 3: Administrative Governance in a Historical Perspective is coordinated by Dr. N. Randeraad. It departs from an understanding of administrative history which not just encompasses rules and regulations governing bureaucracies, or formal criteria for measuring the growth of bureaucracies, but also the concrete operation of public administration, both in its executive functions and in its involvement in policy-making. Moreover, this research goes beyond classical approaches in Administrative History as it puts an emphasis on the transnational dimension of the role of information and expertise, on questions of legitimacy and democratic potential, and on transparency and communication. PCE members contributing to this research theme are working on subjects such as the history of European integration and enlargement, the history of statistics, social welfare in a transnational perspective, and the history of European interest groups. Clearly, the focal point Administrative Governance is part of the 'administrative turn' in EU studies that Jarle Trondal identified in his 2007 'state of the art' contribution to the Journal of European Public Policy63. What makes our research different from other approaches in the field is a desire to 'open the black box' of the administration of the EU and to grasp its influence on policy-making and implementation by analyzing the processes out of which relevant (and perhaps 63 Trondal J. (2007) The Public Administration Turn in Integration Research, Journal of European Public Policy 14(6), pp. 960 - 972. 52 biased) informational asymmetries emerge. This orientation toward the 'politics of informing' the EU and its concomitant perception of bureaucratic organisations as information processing systems not only gives the Maastricht research on inter- and supranational bureaucracies a specific profile, but also links and unites the different research themes. It allows for synergy in research and for an articulate, long term PhD programme, while at the same time functioning as an intellectual and organisational framework in raising research funds. It also makes the PCE programme visible internationally.64 The PCE programme also plays an important role within the thematic profile areas of research and teaching identified by Maastricht University, especially in 'Europe and a Globalising world'.65 The UM has a reputation to uphold in the field of EU studies, European and international law and international economics/political economy. Clearly the 'European' research of FASoS belongs to the core of this research area. 2. Composition of the research group Over the last 5 years the number of participants in PCE has grown slowly but steadily. The research time allotted to PCE researchers grew from 15.2 fte in 2005 to 17.7 fte in 2010 (Table 12). The share of research time apportioned to tenured staff grew from 7.8 fte to 10.1 fte in 2010, which reflects a growth in senior staff: from 2 professors and 2 associate professors in 2005 to 5 professors and 4 associate professors in 2010. Even though the majority of PCE members are housed by the Department of Political Science, the background of individual group members is diverse. To illustrate this multi-disciplinary character of PCE, of the 5 PCE professors one has a background in history, one in history and international relations, one in philosophy and sociology, one was trained as an engineer and only one has a background in political science. While the majority of staff members in the lower ranks are political scientists, there are also historians and members with an STS background. The historical input into PCE has been strengthened by the appointments (in 2009) of two young and promising 64 Palgrave recently agreed to establish a book series on Administrative Governance for which two PCE staff members (Christiansen and Vanhoonacker) will act as series editors. In December 2011 an international conference will take place, under the title 'The Politics of Informing the EU', with the goal to prepare the launching volume for the series. 65 See Annex K.4 for further information on the thematic profile areas defined by our university. 53 historians specialised in the history of European integration. At the time of writing we are looking forward to the arrival of the recently appointed professor in European and Global History, Kiran Patel, another serious boost to the historical dimension of PCE. All in all these developments have led to a strengthening of the academic quality of PCE as a research group.

Research environment and embedding The research programme on Politics and Culture in Europe formally exists since 2003. The decision to set up a new research programme corresponded with the development of the new BA European Studies and the ensuing expansion of the academic staff with experts in the fields of political science, public administration, international relations, and history of European integration. Besides this Bachelor programme, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences currently offers four Master programmes in the field of European Studies, serving about 1100 students. As suggested by the 2005 research assessment committee, a two-year Research Master in European Studies has been developed which was successfully accredited in 2009. One advantage of this development is a strengthening of the connection between teaching and research; another is the creation of a pool of well prepared and trained candidates for future PhD positions, candidates that know the research done by PCE intimately. At the faculty level PCE members cooperate with STS members, especially in research on risk politics, standardisation and the role of information66 and with members of AMC on questions of structures and on practices of collective remembrance and transnational history. Our links with the GDI are especially strong in the field of European migration policies, a field on which one senior 66 In 2009 a workshop was organised on 'The Politics of Informing the EU' to which PCE members and a considerable number of members of the research group on Science, Technology and Society contributed. 54 researcher of PCE and two PCE PhD candidates work. Maarten Vink of our group and Valentina Mazzucato of the GDI are leading a UM initiative to create a Maastricht Migration Research Centre. Within Maastricht University the European Studies flank of FASoS cooperates in teaching as well as in research with the Faculty of Law (Departments of European Law and International Law), the School of Business and Economics (Economics Department), the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Science (European Public Health) and the Maastricht School of Governance. Cooperation with the Faculty of Law in research on national and EU public law, especially on the role of parliaments, is institutionalised in the Montesquieu Institute, funded by the Dutch government. At the moment all university staff doing 'European' research meets regularly in the so-called European Corner . We have applied for the establishment of a Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence at FASoS, and if granted this centre will become the university wide organisational framework for cooperation in Europe/EU related research. Moreover, the fact that the UM has chosen 'Europe and a globalising world' as one of the three university- wide thematic profile areas implies a strengthening of the framework (and incentives) for cooperation in the field of Europe related research. Though not itself a university institute, the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA) is also located in Maastricht - 'around the corner', so to say. Again, the European flank of FASoS cooperates intensively with EIPA, in teaching as well as in research. Some EIPA staff members hold 0-hours positions as associate professors to underline the importance of this collaboration between FASoS and EIPA. For example, during the academic year 2007/2008 EIPA and PCE together ran a joint research seminar (monthly meetings) on \"The EU Reform Treaty: What Implications for European Governance?\" Turning to the national level, all members of PCE participate in either the Netherlands Institute of Government (NIG) or the Huizinga Institute. Both are accredited national research schools providing advanced and specialist training for PhD candidates. An additional advantage of these research schools is that they offer PhD candidates a chance to network across Dutch (and some Belgian) universities. At the international level the PCE/Administrative Governance research programme is partaking in an ever more expanding international network of researchers and research institutes. To mention just a few: 55 x Initial Training Network: Dynamics of Inter-institutional Cooperation in the EU (INCOOP, see http://www.in-coop.eu/ ), a cooperation with (among others) Cambridge University, the Fondation nationale des Sciences Politiques Paris (Sciences Po), and the Universities of Loughborough and Mannheim. x Shaping the transnational sphere. Experts, networks, and issues 1850- 1930, a cooperation with St. Andrews University, Institut Universitaire de Hautes Etudes Internationales in Geneva, and the University of Cologne. x The Diplomatic System of the European Union: Evolution, Change and Challenges (DSEU, see http://dseu.lboro.ac.uk/ ), a Jean Monnet Multilateral Research Network jointly with the universities of Leuven and Loughborough. x COMPASSS Systematic Cross-case analysis (see http://www.compasss.org/ ), a cooperation with among others the University of Trier, University of South California, the Universit\u00e9 Libre Bruxelles , the Victoria University of Manchester and the Central European University. x Observatory for Parliaments after the Lisbon Treaty (OPAL, see www.opal- europe.org ), a collaborative research project led by Maastricht University and involving researchers from Cambridge University, Cologne University and Sciences Po, Paris to study the role of national parliaments in the European Union. Members of PCE are moreover in contact with colleagues from outside Maastricht and the Netherlands via membership of international academic organisations APSA, ECPR, EUSA, ISA, UACES, DVPW, BASEES and ReNEUAL, and more in particular, by attending and contributing to the workshops and conferences organised by these associations.67 4. Quality and scientific relevance The most convincing indicator of scientific quality and relevance would of course be the academic reputation PCE enjoys in the eyes of national and international colleagues. As there are no serious surveys available, it is however difficult to establish in a reliable manner how our peers estimate the academic quality of PCE. Yet it may be pointed out that over the last 5 years the visibility of PCE as a research group in the field of European Studies has increased significantly. With 67 APSA - American Political Science Association (annual meeting); ECPR - European Consortium for Political Research; EUSA - European Union Studies Association; ISA - International Studies Association; UACES - University Association of Contemporary Deutsche Vereinigung f\u00fcr Politische Wissenschaft; for the Advancement of Baltic Studies; ReNEUAL - Research Network on European Administrative Law. 56 about 30 members, most of them highly active at national and international workshops and conferences68 it is by now clear to our academic colleagues at other institutes and universities that something interesting is going on in Maastricht. Below we identify highlights of our activities in the period 2005-2010 as well as showcasing high-profile journal articles and other publications (Table 13): Table 13: Selection of especially significant PCE results and publications Researcher Selected significant highlights Year of activity S.

Output of the programme If output in terms of international, peer reviewed publications - in particular in journals that are of central importance for the research area in question69 - is used as an indicator of the academic quality and scientific relevance of a research 69 The focal point journals specifically targeted by PCE in the field of European Studies are: Journal of Common Market Studies; Journal of European Public Policy; West European Politics; European Journal of Social Policy; Comparative European Politics. In the field of International Relations & Foreign Affairs: International Organisation; International Studies Quarterly; European Journal of International Relations. In the field of history: Journal of Contemporary History; Journal of Interdisciplinary History; Journal of Modern History 58 group, the progress made by PCE since the 2005 research assessment is remarkable: From 4 refereed journal articles in 2005 to 16 in 2007, to 28 in 2010. The total of refereed publications increased from 6 in 2005 to 39 in 2010 (Table 14), and many of these are published in journals with excellent impact factors.70 Clearly, PCE has made good on the complaint of the 2005 Research Assessment Committee that PCE \"has in comparison with the other programmes, produced fewer scientific publications (refereed and non-refereed)\".71 The total output of refereed, non-refereed and 'professional' publications grew from 34 in 2005 to 106 in 2010. This growth is also due to a substantial increase of professional publications demonstrating the engagement of PCE-members with societal and especially socio-political questions. If one looks at the number of refereed publications as a percentage of all publications, one can see a doubling of the figures: from 18% in 2005 to 37% in 2010 and a strong growth of refereed publications per research fte (Table 15). Table 14: Publications output PCE 2005-2010 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Refereed articles 4 8 16 15 15 28 Refereed books 1 0 0 0 2 2 Refereed book chapters 1 1 8 3 3 6 Editorship refereed journal 0 0 1 0 0 3 Editorship refereed book 0 0 3 0 0 0 Refereed publications (total) 6 9 28 18 20 39 Non-refereed articles 2 5 5 8 5 5 Non-refereed books 1 1 1 2 0 2 Non-refereed book chapters 9 12 18 14 17 8 Editorship non-refereed journal 0 0 0 0 0 0 Editorship non-refereed book 0 0 1 2 1 1 Non-refereed (total) 12 18 25 26 23 16 PhD thesis 0 1 1 2 1 0 Professional publications 16 19 19 48 39 51 All publications (total) 34 47 73 94 83 106 70 See annex PCE-F.2 for further information. 71 But then the committee also noted the reason for this lagging behind: \"competing demands from heavy teaching loads, the influx of newcomers, and the need to refocus their research projects\" (Report of the evaluation committee on the research of the Faculty of Arts and Culture of Maastricht University, December 2005, p. 10; available in annex B.2. 59 Table 15: Publications output 2005-2010 per research fte 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Refereed publications per research fte72 0.39 (0.59) 0.67 (1.00) 1.87 (2.69) 1.1 (1.44) 1.05 (1.55) 1.97 (2.79) Refereed publications as percentage of all publication 18% 20% 39% 20% 24% 37% 6. Earning capacity Before looking at the figures on our income from external funding it should be noted that for an internationally oriented research group with a strong focus on European funds the Dutch classification of types of research funding may appear a little bit odd if not misleading: 'Research grants' refers exclusively to funds granted by NWO, while funds granted by the EU or non-Dutch research funds are classified as 'contract research'. As the figures show, NWO is certainly not PCE's most important source of external funding (Table 16). In this respect PCE resembles very much all other Dutch research groups in the field of political and administrative science.73 Happily PCE is not uniquely dependent on NWO, as it knows how to apply for European and other non-Dutch research funds. Table 16: Funding PCE 2005-2010 in k\u20ac (turnover) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Direct funding (1) 734.4 695.1 954.7 1.299.0 1.413.5 1.254.0 Research grants (2) 0 0 0 0 0 38.4 Contract research (3) 475.3 75.3 1,461.9 To give some further detail on these summary figures, Table 17 provides an overview of some high-profile research grants which we acquired in competition. 72 Refereed publications = refereed journal articles, refereed books, and refereed book chapters. The figures in brackets show the values if PhD candidates are excluded. 73 As the Netherlands Institute of Government (NIG - the Dutch national research school for political and administrative science) points out in a letter of 4 April 2011: \"Especially when it comes to the 'Vernieuwingsimpuls' [one of the main funding instruments of the NWO] our score has been very meagre until now. In the period 2003-2009 113 applications were submitted, of which 4 were honoured\". 60 Table 17: Some high profile PCE research grants acquired in competition, awarded 2005-2010 (absolute figures) 74 Principal applicant(s) Funding institution Project Amount and duration S.

Academic reputation On the assumption that other research groups/institutes expect their academic quality and prestige to increase by establishing an academic cooperation with 'Maastricht', one indicator of the 'quality and scientific relevance' of PCE research would be the number and intellectual standing of research institutes/universities that have established a serious and formalised research cooperation with the PCE group at FASoS. We maintain institutionalised relations with a host of internationally respected researchers and research groups at, for example, Cambridge University, University of Loughborough, Science Po Paris, Universit\u00e9 Libre Bruxelles , the universities of Leuven, Mannheim, and Cologne and the Central European University at Budapest. As a further proxy of academic reputation, prizes won by members of the PCE group, memberships of academic organisations and editorial boards may be taken. Again we refer to the annexes for a complete overview, but some examples may give an impression (Table 18): 74 See annex PCE-G.2 for a full overview of all acquired grants. 61 Table 18: Some PCE prizes and academic roles as an indication of scholarly reputation75 Researcher Prizes H.

Versluis Member advisory board Netherlands Institute of Government (NIG) (since 2008). 8. Societal relevance: quality, impact and valorisation By now, 'societal relevance' is a standard criterion for the assessment of applications for research funds as provided e.g. by the European FP7, the ERC and the NWO. Yet researchers within PCE/Administrative Governance appreciate the importance of engaging with societal and political problems and issues also outside the context of funding. 75 See annexes PCE-H.1 and PCE-H.2 for a full overview of all prizes and academic roles. 62 Quite naturally for a group like PCE this engagement with societal problems often takes the form of policy briefs, consultancies for Ministries or contributions to workshops of think tanks like Chatham House or the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS). Table 19 shows some examples of externally acquired research projects with explicit societal engagement (see annex PCE-G.2 for a complete list).

'Improving mutual trust amongst EU member states in the areas of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters' (results were used by the Dutch Minister in the EU negotiations in enhancing cooperation in the field of criminal matters.). Another indicator of societal relevance and impact would be professional publications and interviews addressing a non-academic public. Table 20 gives some examples (see annex PCE-I.2 for a full overview): 63 Table 20: Some PCE publications and interviews for a non-academic readership76 Researcher Title Publication place M. van Asselt Overvraagde wetenschappers.

The annual Jean Monnet lecture series that since 2009 has been organised by M. Shackleton, S. Vanhoonacker, and Th. Christiansen should also be mentioned in this context. Each series consists of four thematically related evening lectures for a broad, academic and non-academic public. Central themes so far have been: the EU Institutions beyond the Lisbon Treaty (academic year 2008-09); the EU and its Citizens (academic year 2009-10); the Implementation of the Lisbon Treaty (academic year 2010-11). Another indication of our interest in linking our research to societal needs and to the world of practitioners are the appointments of Michael Shackleton (a high civil servant within the European Parliament) and Hans Schmeets (Director at the Netherlands Office of Statistics, Heerlen) as special chair professors. 76 See annex PCE-I.2 for a full overview of all interviews and PCE-J. for a full overview of all professional publications. 77 Prof. Dr. Georgi Verbeeck changed over to the AMC programme in 2009, but was still a PCE member in 2007. 64 Table 21: Some societal roles of PCE researchers78 Researcher Societal role M.

Viability As already mentioned, in terms of the number of staff, undergraduate and graduate students, the Maastricht European Studies programme and the PCE/Administrative Governance research programme aligned with it, represent one of the (if not the) largest European Studies centre in the world. Starting in 2003, its rapid and even unexpected growth has been accommodated by developments both in the personnel and the content management of the programme. Important in this respect have been the formulation and further development of Administrative Governance as the focal point of PCE and the establishment of a core team of four senior staff members who represent and coordinate the different research themes within the group. Important tasks of this management team are to coach our young researchers in publishing, to identify promising (sub-) themes and research lines, to assist in the writing of research proposals, to organise conferences on various, Administrative Governance related themes and, more in general, to increase the visibility of PCE. The PCE research group meets every three weeks to discuss substantive and methodological topics and questions presented either by PCE members themselves or by colleagues from other universities who are invited for their international reputation. At the end of each academic year a one day conference is organised at which the academic 'harvest' of that year is inspected and discussed. 78 See annex PCE-I.1 for a full overview of all advisory and other roles for a non- academic audience. 65 At least once a year a PCE colloquium is dedicated to strategic concerns. These 'strategy' meetings are prepared by the PCE management team and cover the content of the programme, its structure and procedures as well as our relations and cooperation with European Studies and IR related research groups/institutes around the globe. Supported by the research policy of the Faculty Board the academic composition of the research group has improved, not least by appointing more professors and associate professors over the recent years (Table 22). Table 22: Numbers of PCE staff at various levels, December 2010 Academic function Number Full professors 4 Part-time and special professors 3 Associate professors 5 Assistant professors, tenured 8 Assistant professors, tenure track 6 Assistant professors, temporary 2 Postdocs 4 PhD candidates 8 All in all, from a human resources and research management perspective we are convinced that the European Studies related research as concentrated in PCE will be viable also in the long term. Until now there are no signs that student numbers, and related to that, staff numbers will decline. On the contrary, an increase in the number of students and staff positions seems much more probable. 66 10. SWOT analysis Strengths (What are we good at?) Weaknesses (Where are we weak) x Coherent and innovative research within focal point 'Administrative Governance'. x Quality and quantity of output. x International composition of the research group and international cooperation in research and teaching. x External funding (non-Dutch). x Integration between research and teaching (Research Master European Studies). x Well embedded in the UM and the region. x Low success rate in applications for (NWO) research funds. x Relatively strong disciplinary background in political science diminishes multidisciplinary character. Opportunities (what chances for improvement) Threats (what developments might threaten us?) x Strengthening our cooperation with other (faculty and UM wide) research groups. x Clear relation to the emerging UM profile area \"Europe and a Globalising world\". x Good opportunities for expanding and strengthening our academic networks in North America and South-East Asia. x Decreasing funding by the Dutch government. x Rapid growth of the research group could lead to difficulties in integrating different research interests. 11. Strategy Content of the research focal point: Practically all members of PCE have teaching responsibilities in the Bachelor European Studies and the four European Studies Masters that were developed since 2002. In line with that an important, though not exclusive, concern of PCE/Administrative Governance research has been Europe and the EU in particular. Europe and EU related topics will remain an important focus of our research in the coming years as it would not be wise to neglect the experience, knowledge and academic positions acquired in this field. Yet we want to expand the empirical scope of our research to other international organisations, whether organisations of regional integration like ASEAN, 67 MERCOSUR and the African Union, or global organisations of a political and/or regulatory kind like the UN, WTO, IMF and NATO. The concepts and approaches that have been developed in our field can be fruitfully applied to other international organisations in our view and would at the same time open up new ways of interaction between European Studies and International Relations. In place of a focal point on ' European Administrative Governance' we want to develop a focal point on 'Administrative Governance by the bureaucracies of trans-, supra and international organisations'. This research will again be inspired by an interest both in the role and the influence of civil servants in these organisations. We believe that this broader scope will also allow for a wider range of research interests and will further strengthen the coherence of PCE as a research collective.79 It will moreover lend a robust basis for cooperation with the Globalisation and Development Initiative at FASoS and fits well with the university-wide profile area 'Europe and a Globalising world'. International cooperation: The expansion of our empirical scope will as such boost our efforts to expand our research networks and affiliations in a truly global direction. As contacts with researchers and institutes in the US and South-East Asia are manifold there are excellent chances to institutionalise and make more formal our relations with these non-European academics and centres. At the moment an Erasmus Mundus application for the joint development of a postgraduate programme together with Japanese and South-Korean universities is still pending with the European Commission. The same holds for an application for a Multilateral Research Group on EU-Asia Relations in which again scholars from South-East Asian universities participate. Relations with the Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) are longstanding as some PCE members collaborated with CASS in the (EU funded) development of a European Studies Masters programme offered at different Chinese universities. With regard to the US, apart from almost formalised relations with Guy Peters from Pittsburgh University, some members of PCE did their PhD at American universities and still maintain their contacts. 79 In advance of this reorientation of the PCE focal point a Handbook on EU-Asia Relations will be published by Palgrave, co-edited by Th. Christiansen together with colleagues from Essex University and the University of Melbourne. An international conference on this topic, involving the presentation of draft chapters, is planned for September 2011 in Maastricht. 68 Securing our funding base: Given the experience and capacity PCE has been building up in acquiring external research funds, especially in acquiring non- Dutch, 'European' research money, we are confident that we can secure sufficient financial resources for our research in the years to come. Given a recent reorganisation of the MaGW section at the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),80 the chances for success of our applications to NWO also seem to have improved. We will continue our efforts in levering in research money, and will also seek to diversify our funding sources. Increasing the number of PhD candidates: An important objective for the future still remains an increased output of high quality dissertations. In line with the general policies of FASoS in this respect (see section III below), PCE will contribute to an increase of our dissertations output in three ways. First, we will preferentially target research funds for establishing PhD positions. Second, we aim to increase the number of 'external' (non-employed) PhDs. This objective is tackled, inter alia, by using the UM's Brussels Campus as a site where intensive courses and workshops are given in support of research done by external PhDs.81 Third, the (still pending) application for a Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence to be established at the UM/FASoS was supported by the University of Cologne, the Universit\u00e9 de Liege, the European Institute of Public Administration and the European Journalism Centre and explicitly includes the intention to further develop a framework for joint PhD supervision. In case that this application fails the institutes and researchers involved will nevertheless go ahead with setting up inter-institutional PhD supervision as it has the clear advantage that PhD candidates can consult a much broader range of scholarly experts, while a double degree will enhance their chances on a future academic career. 80 The NWO MaGW division has give a stronger role to the panel which decides on Law, Administrative and Political Sciences, and success rates for political scientists have increased significantly in 2010. It remains to be seen how permanent this change is. 81 For further information, see http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Education/FacultiesSchools/OtherIns titutes/CampusBrussels/PhDProgrammes/EuropeanStudiesForProfessionals.htm 69 II.2 Research Programme \"Science, Technology and Society\" (STS) 1. Objectives and research area The aim of the STS Research Programme is to study science-technology-society relations: the social construction of science and technology, the techno-scientific constitution of society, and the interactions between science and technology. Within the broad field of science, technology and society studies (STS), the specific emphasis of Maastricht STS research is on \"cultures of innovation\". With \"cultures'' we refer to habitual, taken-for-granted and symbol-laden ways of understanding and acting upon the world in particular settings. The settings we are interested in are those infused with new knowledge, instruments, artefacts and skills. These may breach the conventions in these cultures, or are moulded themselves while being appropriated. Our focus on \"cultures of innovation\" then means that we examine how change and innovation evolve in cultures such as the technology workshop, the regulatory body, the laboratory, the audio studio, the science caf\u00e9, or the hospital. The Maastricht STS research programme has a strong coherence when described in terms of approach and methodology. Contemporary issues in modern societies, constituted by science and technology, form the common starting point of research. Our research is problem-based and focused on contemporary issues, which are however studied in historical perspective. Maastricht STS projects are always sensitive to normative issues, and often explicitly address political or ethical questions. There is a strong theoretical component in the research agenda, though all research is empirically grounded - see for example the work in empirical ethics. Cultures of innovation are studied in a radically interdisciplinary way. STS in Maastricht is practised as an emerging discipline. Although the classic disciplines of sociology, history and philosophy play an important constituting role, we celebrate their integration into a common STS idiom, research style and set of methodological approaches. Sociological problems are historicized; historical questions are shown to have normative dimensions; and ethical issues are studied as social phenomena. The analysis will typically move between different 70 levels: from micro-level studies of local practices to macro-level questions of governance, policy and morality. The combination of social sciences' and humanities' styles of research is visible in our effort to write elegant and engaging prose, to use counter-intuitive research questions, and to combine empirics and theory in primarily qualitative and interpretative approaches. Maastricht STS research is adventurous in exploring a variety of theoretical and empirical fault lines; but it is always rigorous in its methodological approach, scientific grounding, and scholarly justifications. Our research fruitfully overlaps with, or rubs against, research fields such as risk studies, sound studies, development studies, ethics, and internet and new media studies. From STS we seek to contribute to debates in other academic disciplines, and to discussions amongst the practitioners whom we study. Under the aegis of \"cultures of innovation\" there are several substantive research lines of varying size.82 The governance of risk and vulnerability - with studies of telecommunication standardisation, hospital safety, nanotechnology governance, livelihoods in India as shaped by techno-scientific innovations, risks of chemicals or low-intensity electromagnetic radiation, and computer simulations for water management - is one line.83 Technological cultures of sound - from innovation in musical instruments to airport noise regulation, from the epistemological status of sonic laboratory skills to the rise of car sound design - presents a second line in which Maastricht is a world-leading research centre. Media technologies in knowledge and culture - ranging from the history of European broadcasting to the use of Internet and digitisation in scientific research - is a third research line. Scientific research and innovation cultures - comprising historical studies of chemical industry, the co-production of biological sciences and urban ecology, the mutual shaping of international science and politics, and the role of value systems - forms a fourth line. Techno-moral change - with a special focus on life sciences and emerging technologies - constitutes the recently established fifth research line. 82 Within the framework of extra funding to focus and strengthen FASoS research, discussed in part A, for the STS Research Programme \"STS\" was chosen as focal point. As further discussed in the SWOT analysis below, we did not consider any lack of focus to be a weakness of the programme. 83 As in the other research programmes of FASoS, these lines do not divide the research programme into separate groups. Research projects run across several of the labels and an event organised by one group will usually involve other researchers of STS (and the other research programmes). 71 With these research lines, the STS Programme is a key contributor to the recently defined central research focal points of Maastricht University: \"Learning and \"Quality of Life.\"84 Reflecting on the way our research programme has evolved in recent years, we see three developments with much potential for the near future (for more details, see section on II.2.11 on Strategy ). Our research is, first, increasingly oriented towards societal and policy relevance at local, national, European and global levels; sometimes by actively engaging in such societal interventions. Maastricht STS has always been actively engaged with the world, yet has broadened the levels at which it does so. This is reflected in the central research questions of some projects, the use of social experimentation methods in others, and the advisory activities of individual members outside academia. The output of our research varies accordingly: it ranges from instrumental problem solving, theoretical understanding, and disciplinary peer-reviewed publications to translating STS to larger audiences and making it useful in non-academic environments. Secondly, the empirical base is, stimulated by teaching the CAST Research Master, now broadened to also include arts and media (see section I.10, Next generation ). Our interest in the arts shows in how we involve literary writers in developing rich scenarios for the future of emerging technologies, study the appropriation of digital technologies in musical practice and notions of authorship, understand obsolete observatories as visual icons, or examine the effect of shifting musical skills on the use of sound and listening in science and engineering. Rather than adding the arts to our long-standing interest in science and technology, we increasingly see that we need the arts to understand how cultures of innovation, including their societal regulation, depend on imagination, tropes of descent, iconicity and artistic skills. And, thirdly, an internationally comparative agenda, asking questions about the role of science and technology for development, is increasingly important. The central question here is how cultures of innovation can help (or sometimes hamper) a country's development. \"Development\", herein, is taken as a concept that describes changes in African and Indian societies, as much as in European societies. 84 See Annex K.4 for further information on the thematic profile areas defined by our university. 72 How can we contribute to an understanding of European, Indian or African cultures of innovation by comparing these? And: how can such cultures be innovated to give shape to a country's development? Thus Maastricht researchers were centrally involved in developing Indian and African Manifestos on Science and Technology; herein Indian and African scientists, activists and policy makers formulate strategies to help their countries take democratic control of their own research and innovation agendas. Another way of characterizing a research programme is by its international and national affiliations. Maastricht STS researchers are most active in the international scholarly societies 4S, SHOT and EASST. We also regularly attend HSS, SPT, PSA, AOIR, SRA and SNET.85 Within the Dutch national research funding agency NWO, the Maastricht STS group primarily, but not exclusively, works with the social sciences (MaGW), humanities (GW) and development sciences (WOTRO) Departments. Most of our European projects are funded from the Science in Society programme, but also by Marie Curie, COST, Environment, Sustainable Development, and Transportation. 2. Composition of the research group Researchers from all five FASoS departments participate in the Maastricht STS Research programme, constituting a multidisciplinary group with roots in sociology and anthropology, philosophy, history, literary and arts studies, and political sciences. The staff of the STS programme has increased over the past five years by some 30%, with a concurrent growth of the research fte apportioned to STS researchers (see Table 23). Table 23: Research staff STS programme 2005-2010 in fte* 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Tenured staff 6.0 6.0 6.2 6.0 6.9 7.2 Non-tenured staff 3.1 0.8 1.9 2.4 2.2 4.0 PhD candidates 6.2 3.1 4.0 6.2 8.7 10.5 Total 15.3 9.9 12.1 14.6 17.8 21.7 * On 31 December of the year concerned; including M-VKS 85 4S: Society for Social Studies of Science; SHOT: Society for the History of Technology; EASST: European Association for the Study of Science and Technology; HSS: History of Science Society; SPT: Society for Philosophy and Technology; PSA: Philosophy of Science Association; AOIR: Association of Internet Researchers; SRA: Society for Risk Analysis; SNET: Society for the Study of Nanoscience and Emerging Technologies. 73 The STS programme hosts the Maastricht Virtual Knowledge Studio (M- VKS) . The M-VKS forms an integrated part of the STS programme, but was administered separately during the assessment period because of its relationship to the KNAW (see section IV.2. below for more information). 3. Research environment and embedding The Maastricht STS Research programme is well embedded in FASoS, has some fruitful working relations with other groups at Maastricht University, and plays a leading role nationally and internationally in the STS scientific community. Within the FASoS Research Institute, we collaborate with AMC on science and technology in arts, creative cultures and new media, and with PCE on questions of information politics, regulation, democratisation and vulnerability governance. The emerging Globalisation and Development Initiative was initially housed by STS and has close relations with it specifically in the area of STS for development. The embedding of STS research in FASoS is also visible in its close relationship to teaching. Concrete opportunities for research-teaching integrations are offered at Bachelor level by the honours and the Marble programmes, and at the Master level by CAST and ESST. The STS programme has fruitful relations to some other groups at Maastricht University. These include UNU-Merit (the combined institute of Maastricht University and the United Nations University on the economics of technology and development), ICIS (International Centre for Integrated assessment and Sustainable development), and researchers in the UM Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences. Nationally the STS research programme is the managing institution of the Netherlands graduate research school WTMC (Science, Technology and Modern Culture). Various personal and working relationships with institutes such as the Gezondheidsraad (The Health Council of the Netherlands), Rathenau Institute (the Dutch technology assessment institute), other universities, and NWO guarantee a solid position in the Dutch research establishment. 74 4. Quality and scientific relevance The best way to assess the academic quality and scientific relevance of any group is by evaluating the contents of its output. Table 24 highlights five especially significant results of our work, five journal articles, and five books which we consider to be a good illustration of the quality and significance of the work of the STS programme. These books and articles form part of the information package of the assessment committee.

The scientific quality and relevance of the work by the Maastricht STS Research Programme has improved since the previous research assessment of 2005, judged by the number of (peer reviewed) publications, externally funded research projects, and roles in non-academic arenas. 5. Output of the programme The output of the STS Research programme has developed well. In the period 2005-2010 the number of refereed publications per research fte (including PhD candidates) doubled from 0.77 to 1.55 (from 1.28 to 2.78 without PhD candidates) and the number of refereed publications as percentage of the total output increased from 20% to 42% (Table 26).86 Table 25: Publications output STS 2005-2010 (including M-VKS) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Refereed articles 10 5 16 9 11 22 Refereed books 1 1 1 3 1 0 Refereed book chapters 1 1 1 2 7 13 Editorship refereed journal 0 1 1 0 0 0 Editorship refereed book 0 0 1 1 1 2 Refereed publications (total) 12 8 20 15 20 37 Non-refereed articles 8 8 4 5 3 4 Non-refereed books 1 0 1 0 1 1 Non-refereed book chapters 12 19 20 14 8 11 Editorship non-refereed journal 0 0 0 2 0 0 Editorship non-refereed book 2 4 3 4 1 1 Non-refereed publications (total) 23 31 28 25 13 17 PhD thesis 0 1 3 2 2 0 Professional publications 24 37 28 30 20 35 All publications (total) 59 77 79 72 55 89 86 See annex STS-F.2 for an overview of the journals in which refereed articles were published and for journal impact factors. 76 Table 26: Publication output STS 2005-2010 per research fte 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Refereed publications per research fte87 0.77 (1.28) 0.76 (1.08) 1.54 (2.22) 0.94 (1.53) 1.02 (1.82) 1.55 (2.78) Refereed publications as percentage of all publication 20% 11& 26% 21% 38% 42% As in the other research programmes, STS researchers agreed a set of focal point journals. The list has no mandatory character but serves as an advice on publication strategy and as a help to strengthen the programme's profile and external visibility.88 6. Earning capacity Since 2008 we have a dedicated policy in place to enhance the success in acquiring research funds, including every half year a workshop for all STS staff and PhD candidates on grant writing and fund acquisition. This may have contributed to an increase in externally acquired funds of 100%, taking the research grants and contract research numbers together (see Table 27). Table 27: Funding STS 2005-2010 in k\u20ac (including M-VKS, turnover) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Direct funding (1) 739.2 533.5 An indirect indication for scientific quality and relevance is offered by the research grants acquired in competition (see Table 28 for a few prominent ones and annex STS-G.2. for a full list). 87 Refereed publications = refereed journal articles, refereed books, and refereed book chapters. The figures in brackets show the values if PhD candidates are excluded. 88 These are: Science, Technology and Human Values (Impact factor 2007: 1,711; 5- year impact factor: 1,905); Social Studies (Impact factor 2007: 1,651; 5-year impact factor: 2,124); 0,809; 5-year impact factor: 0,736). 77 Table 28: Some high profile STS research grants acquired in competition, awarded 2005-2010 (absolute figures) 89 Principal applicant(s) Funding institution Project Amount and duration W.E.

Academic reputation Scientific quality should lead to academic reputation, but the indicators are different. Academic reputation describes the place one holds among academic peers. For individuals we can evaluate this by citing prizes, invitations for scholarly contributions, and memberships of academic professional functions. For a group this is more difficult. The reputation of a research group certainly plays a role when postdocs decide to apply to jobs in that group or when grant proposal reviewers assess the quality of the institutional environment the group offers. Another indicator is the number of invitations the group receives to participate in international research consortia, such as for the European framework programmes. And the reputation of a group is perhaps best assessed by eavesdropping in receptions of international meetings of scholarly societies... Compared to the previous research assessment (2005), the academic reputation of the Maastricht STS Research Programme seems to have markedly improved, judged by the kind of prizes, academic roles, and research projects acquired in competition (see Table 29 for some examples and annexes STS-H.1 and STS-H.2 for a full list). 89 See annex STS-G.2 for a full overview of all acquired grants. 78 Table 29: Some STS prizes and academic roles as an indication of scholarly reputation Researcher Prizes W.E.

Societal relevance: quality, impact and valorisation Societal relevance is an important objective of Maastricht STS research. We actively seek engagement with the societal, political and practitioners' contexts that we study. All European FP7 and some nationally funded projects have this character (see Table 30 for some examples and annex STS-G.2 for a full list)). Table 30: Some externally funded STS projects with explicit societal engagement, 2005-2010 Researcher Project Type of funding Kind of societal engagement W.E. Bijker, R. Zeiss BESSE EU-FP7.

Supervision of experimentations with knowledge management (Italy), knowledge mediation (Spain), knowledge communication (Slovenia), and knowledge evaluation (Denmark). Another indicator of the societal relevance and impact of research are professional publications and interviews for a non-academic audience (Table 31). 80 Table 31: Some STS publications and interviews for a non-academic readership90 Researcher Title Publication place A. Jacobs & J. Aalbers Radio interview on \"soundscapes of the urban 2009. W.E. Bijker the scientists' story (interview). The New Indian Express, 21-10- 2010, interview VPRO-radio November 2008. G.J.

A clear indication of societal relevance, though still difficult to valorise in any quantitative sense, are advisory and consulting roles that members of the Maastricht STS group play (see Table 32 for some examples and annex STS-I.1 for a full list).

Wyatt Expert Group on Monitoring Policy and Research Activities on Science in Society in Europe (MASiS), member; European Commission, Research Directorate, Brussels. Dutch STS is internationally outstanding because of its established role in the Netherlands as a recognised source for expertise on the role of science and technology in society. 90 See annex STS-I.2 for a full overview of all interviews and STS-J. for a full overview of all professional publications. 81 The Maastricht STS Research Programme has always played a leading role in this, and its continuing dedicated policy to engage in non-academic activities has resulted in a further increase in societal impact and valorisation since 2005. 9. Viability The Maastricht STS Research Programme is one of the largest STS programmes in the world, if measured in terms of staff numbers, undergraduate and graduate teaching, national embedding and recognition, and international engagement and visibility. This may also pose problems. The sheer size of the group has, for example, necessitated a new set-up of the internal research colloquia (see last section). The 'demography' of the Maastricht STS Research Programme has recently been improved by the appointment of several professors, but the number of associate professors and tenure-track staff is too small (see Table 33). Table 33: Numbers of STS staff at various levels, December 2010 Academic function Number Full professors 3 Part-time and special professors 3 Associate professors 3 Assistant professors, tenured 10 Assistant professors, tenure track 1 Assistant professors, temporary 4 Postdocs 4 PhD candidates 16 The increasing size of the programme has also called for new management forms (see the final section). We are confident that the newly formed \"STS Executive Team\" will guarantee the long-term viability of the Maastricht STS Research Programme. Probably the most promising characteristic of the Maastricht STS research programme at this moment is the balance between excellent individuals and a thriving and supportive community. During 2009 and 2010 we used the ear-marked \"focal point funds\" to critically reflect upon our profile, internal functioning and external visibility (see next section). This endeavour was concluded with a weekend in The Ardennes. An integrated programme of presentations, hiking, group discussions, and joint cooking resulted in the building blocks for this self-evaluation and the strategy for 82 the period 2011-2014. The following sections 10 and 11 are partly based on the work during this Ardennes weekend. One other crucial element in the viability of a research group is its ability to acquire external research funding (see section II.2.6 on Earning Power ). 10. SWOT analysis A critical self-assessment resulted in identifying our strengths and weaknesses, and the possible positive and negative developments in the near and mid-term future (see below). The core of these strengths and weaknesses were identified in 2008 when we designed a project for using the ear-marked \"focal point funds.\" We decided that our strength was the individual and collective quality in the STS Research Programme; and the weakness was our not making enough use of it. Several subprojects were designed to address this.91 One subproject was to establish some benchmarking on the basis of an international comparison to other centres of excellence. We equipped small exploratory missions to STS centres of excellence abroad, and investigated how these centres are managing their institution and work. We thus visited the Zentrum f\u00fcr Geschichte des Wissens , Z\u00fcrich; Centre for Lancaster; Science and Technology Studies Department , Cornell University; and the Science,Technology & Society Department , MIT. These were very fruitful visits where we learned much and further strengthened our existing ties with these groups. All these activities came together in the Ardennes workshop, mentioned above. Those discussions have now been translated into the SWOT analysis and the various elements of our research management strategy for 2011-2014. 91 These subprojects were: four exploratory missions to STS centres of excellence, a book publication of English translations of the inaugural lectures by Maastricht STS professors, an investment leading to the publication of the Sound Studies Handbook (Oxford University Press), an investment leading to the publication of the edited volume Vulnerability in Technological Cultures (submitted to MIT Press), a new website, a dedicated effort to create a research consortium on university- industry research relations, three 6-months postdoc positions to write research proposals, a book publication with key texts from the Maastricht STS Research Programme. 83 Strengths (what are we good at?) x Quality and quantity of scientific output. x International relations for research and teaching collaboration. x Research-teaching integration in Master programmes ESST and CAST and via recently created MARBLE projects. x Amount of externally acquired research funding. x Internal coherence. x Interdisciplinary collaboration. between historians, philosophers and social scientists. x Quality of research colloquia. x Directorship of The Netherlands Graduate Research School WTMC. Weaknesses (where are we weak?) x Inadequate web presence and visibility. x Facilities to receive visiting researchers. x Flexibility in teaching programmes to receive visiting professors. x Lack of space on programme of research colloquia. Opportunities (what chances for improvement may appear?) x Good chances for continued external funding from NWO and EU. x More collaboration within Maastricht University is possible (UNU-Merit, ICIS, School of Governance, FHML). Threats (what developments might threaten us when we would not react adequately?) x Decreasing funding from central government. x Increased external funding may threaten the stability and internal coherence, and the integration of STS researchers into teaching. Let us briefly review the results from this SWOT analysis in historical perspective. Although the 2005 and 2008 external assessment committees hardly identified any weaknesses, we used their evaluations to identify possibilities for improvement. After 2005 we formulated an even stronger international position, more externally funded projects, the inclusion of a development-oriented agenda in our STS research, and further strengthening of WTMC and CAST as targets. The mid-term review (2008) advised us to identify competitors, to position Maastricht STS vis- \u00e0-vis main theoretical developments in the field, and to actively create opportunities for building networks to improve competitiveness for funding. 84 This advice directly shaped the agenda for our benchmarking and profiling subproject, which resulted in the SWOT analysis. The weaknesses mainly relate to our ambition to be more internationally visible; one weakness, of the research colloquia, results from our success in growth and intensive internal interactions. All these weaknesses are addressed in strategies for improvement (next section). The threat of decreasing funding from central government (\"first money steam\") is not specific for STS; indeed, STS may arguably be in a better position to counter this threat than some other groups in the social sciences and humanities. Nevertheless, the threat is real and needs adequate actions. Paradoxically, we also see an increased external funding as a potential threat, when not handled well. For example, the internal coherence of the research programme may be eroded when research projects are acquired \"just for the money\", without carefully aligning them with the substantive research agenda. Often the applications to external funding do require the participation of senior researchers. This threatens to gradually pull the most successful researchers out of teaching. 11. Strategy The current strengths of quality and coherence are not self-propelling but need continuous maintenance work. We are confident that the specific measures planned (and discussed below) to counter weaknesses and threats and to seize opportunities will sufficiently direct this maintenance work. Perhaps the most crucial condition to be optimistic about maintaining these strengths is the enthusiastic commitment of all research staff involved, from PhD candidates to professors. We think that the Maastricht STS Programme is well positioned to counter the threats related to external funding, when we continue to exploit our strengths strategically and actively seek to benefit from the new opportunities. The new leadership structure in the Research Programme will help to realize this. Other weaknesses relate to our academic interactions, internally and with the outside world. The Ardennes workshop resulted in a broadly shared diagnosis of the current state of the Maastricht STS Research Programme, and of a joint strategy to prepare the programme for the next 5 years. We here briefly summarize the strategies on substantive research agenda, web presence, external relations, teaching-research integration, research colloquia, and leadership. 85 For the necessary funds to implement these strategies we will apply to central funding of the FASoS Research Institute, and draw on the STS Research Programme's reserves resulting from budgeted overhead in external research contracts. Substantive research agenda : Maastricht STS has been \"foundational for the global sub-discipline of 'technology studies'\" 92, and it is now again at the forefront of three distinct new research foci in global STS. The first is a broadening of agenda and engagement beyond academia - sometimes called 'intervention research', 'third wave science studies', or 'engaged humanities.' Examples are our contributions to the societal dialogue on nanotechnologies in the Netherlands and the participation in hospital safety committees. The second line is a broadening of the empirical domain to also include the arts; for this we collaborate with the AMC research programme, especially in carrying out the CAST Research Master. Examples of this second research line are several projects in sound studies and digital media as well as projects on creative industries related to urban planning. The third new research line results from a broadening to include the non-western and the global south, with projects in India and Africa on nanotechnologies and innovation in local knowledge and technology practices (water, health, pest management, handloom). All three foci have grown naturally from previous work in the Maastricht STS programme, and all three constitute important frontiers in global STS; we thus expect Maastricht STS to continue as an internationally leading research centre. Research-teaching integration: The relation between teaching and research has traditionally been strong in Maastricht and we cherish that relationship. We have planned specific steps to strengthen the relation between STS research and our teaching in the two Bachelor programmes; the implementation of these plans, however, falls within the purview of the FASoS Teaching Institute, rather than the FASOS Research Institute. We will also investigate whether topics for ESST and CAST thesis research can be related more closely to the STS Research Programme. External relations: We will strengthen the Maastricht STS community by more regularly involving the alumni, both CAST Masters and PhDs. Inspired by the Cornell practice, we will organise an annual \"Maastricht STS conference\" for 92 External Research Assessment Report 2005: p.25 (available in the online documentation, annex B.2.). 86 alumni, graduate students, staff and a few invited international colleagues. The substantive planning and organisation will be done by PhD candidates, facilitated by the staff of STS Research Programme. Moreover, we will design a dedicated academic exchange programme. This programme will aim at hosting one visiting \"STS Fellow\" at any moment of the year. We will be pro-active in inviting researchers who can stimulate and enhance specific research activities in the STS Programme. Financial and organisational measures will be taken, including office facilities, housing facilities, and flexible options for teaching and coaching activities. Maastricht STS staff will also be stimulated to visit foreign institutes. External visibility by web presence: A new STS website is being designed, which will be combined with the newly developed CAST website and incorporated in the Maastricht University and FASoS website.93 The website will be primarily aimed at a general, non-academic public while STS-peers will be served through links deeper into the website and with down-loadable papers. The STS Research Programme will be presented as a community in an international network, rather than a set of individuals with individual links. The associated CAST website will provide course books, students' work, blogs, interviews with international guests, etc. Structural funding for an STS PhD student as web-editor (0.1 fte) will be provided. Additionally a dedicated training and maintenance programme will be set-up to get staff and students to regularly update their information themselves. Research colloquia: In response to the growing demand of colloquium time (due to the increasing number of researchers) and our aim to be more open to the outside world, we will create two sets of meetings. First we will reshape the existing seminar, which is held every third Wednesday afternoon, rotating with the colloquia of AMC and PCE, into a public colloquium that will be more broadly advertised (though without making it into a Studium Generale kind of lecture). Members of the STS Research Programme will help to organise these colloquia by inviting colleagues from other universities in The Netherlands or abroad. A fund to reimburse travel and lodging costs will be created. These colloquia will typically be public lectures and paper presentations, followed by a discussant from the STS group kicking off the plenary discussion. Secondly, we will create a new series of weekly brown bag lunch meetings of one hour, which are meant for STS staff and PhD candidates exclusively. This series will comprise various types 93 We will give priority to the visibility of the STS website and not wait until all problems of the University websites have been solved. 87 of sessions: work in progress, \" help me out !\", problem definition ( \"I see an interesting problematic, but how to translate it into a researchable question? \"), research proposal drafting, theme exploration (in the past we already had such seminars on themes like ethnography, vulnerability, intervention research), and journal monitoring (each staff member will monitor one journal and regularly report on relevant issues). The M-VKS has organised a series of annual one-day workshops which have provided a focal point for work on digital technologies across the faculty and beyond. The first 'digitising lives' (March 2009) aimed primarily to bring together colleagues from within the Faculty with those working in other KNAW institutions. The second 'digitising art & science' (March 2010) brought together practitioners and theorists from across a variety of institutions in the region and from elsewhere in the Netherlands. The third 'participatory knowledge production' (April 2011) issued an open call for papers and attracted an international group of scholars, and will result in a peer-reviewed publication (proposal accepted by the journal Information, Communication & Society. These workshops have quickly established a reputation for critical, interdisciplinary discussion of what digitisation means for society and knowledge production. Research management and leadership : Since the beginning of 2011, the programme's leadership is formed by an \"STS Executive Team\" Bijker (chair), Bijsterveld, Swierstra, Wyatt, Homburg and Hommels. We are confident that this will secure continuity and quality of scientific leadership of the Maastricht STS Research Programme in the next period and beyond. 88 II.3 Research Programme \"Arts, Media and Culture\" (AMC) 1. Objectives and research area The aim of the AMC programme is to study how developments in the arts and in the media relate to socio-cultural and political changes. We are particularly interested in the ways in which cultural artefacts and practices operate as socially and politically shaping forces. We study the whole spectrum of high-brow, middle- brow and low-brow culture, ranging from poems and installation artworks to political essays, monuments and digital games. What unites these inquiries is our interest in the practices in which they are produced, distributed and received. We do not only analyse, for instance, how the content of popular baroque theatre plays reflects the political concerns of their day, but also how their actual performance impacted on their audiences and formed their attitudes. This emphasis on the societal dimension of our objects is reflected in our methodology. The researchers of this programme are united by a firm basis in the hermeneutic tradition, yet seek to enrich it with methods and concepts from reception studies, post-phenomenology, on- and offline ethnography and anthropological field work in order to come to terms with readership, spectatorship, and the rise of new types of audiences, like the 'wreader'94 in contemporary fan practices. The programme is interdisciplinary not only in the sense that we represent and combine various disciplines from within the field of the humanities, but also because we explore possible crossovers with the social sciences. With regard to our research themes there has been a major change in recent years. Until 2009 the AMC programme went under the name of Science and Culture: Texts and Contexts , with a focus on the interconnections of arts and literature with science and technology. This profile of the research programme has been very productive and there are still dissertations under way which result from it. The reformulation of the programme was instigated by changes in membership: the departure of prof. dr. M. Bosch from the Centre of Gender and Diversity and prof. dr. R. Zwijnenberg, both at the end of 2008. In 2009, the Centre for Gender and Diversity (CGD) became part of the programme. 94 A merging of the writer and the reader. 89 Its entry into the programme was facilitated by the implementation of the focal point of 'cultural memory and diversity', which helped us to redirect our research priorities and generate more cohesion. We have chosen to bring about the necessary re-shuffling of research topics by working in small, flexible and often overlapping groups, working for a specific stretch of time on specific projects such as a symposium, publication or research proposal. In many respects this procedure has worked quite well. New research projects have been initiated linking researchers from the CGD with AMC researchers. Moreover, our programme attracted historical research on memorial practices. The focus on science is still retained, but in a more historicised form, while research on digital media brings in particular attention to the creative practices of spectators, players and other 'users'. Visually, the thematic structure of our research field is rather like a cluster of overlapping circles than a deductive tree- like scheme neatly branching from one general topic to a variety of more specific topics. The same goes for our organisational structure. There is an obvious danger in this, that of fragmentation, an issue which we address more extensively below. Compared to the individually-based way of working in the past, however, the new set up has brought much more coherence. For one thing, it has greatly stimulated collaborative projects which in turn enhanced synergy between individual research projects. Despite the apparent variety of research concerns, several defining characteristics hold the cluster together and distinguish it from comparable programmes in the humanities. One prime instrument for the creation of overlaps and fruitful interactions between the circles is the definition of \"Cultural Memory and Diversity\" as our focal point . Our approach is marked by an emphasis on empirical practices of cultural memory formation and an emphasis on unintentional forms of cultural memory. With regard to the first emphasis, we are especially interested in bottom-up processes of cultural heritage formation. For example, we study how participants of commemorations deal with traumatic events from the past; the very beginnings of cultural socialisation in pre-school kids; new forms of literacy such as the remixing of popular music; and shop-floor decisions of conservators that shape how works of art will look in the future. With regard to the second emphasis, we assume that cultural remembrance is not just a deliberate, fully conscious process of Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung , but also a largely unwitting reiteration of established literary and aesthetic repertoires for representing historical actors within the parameters of nationality, gender, ethnicity, age, ability and religion. As we study both the intentional and the unintentional 90 aspects of cultural remembrance, we can address them as mutually formative forces. Currently, we address our focal point of cultural memory and diversity on the basis of four main research themes .95 First, research clustering around the topic of memorial politics deals with cultural memory in its intentional form s: the history of commemorations of war; contemporary processes of questioning the truth about painful episodes in the past; the many ways in which truth finding and memorial practices take place and to what effect; and the complex way s in which monuments and buildings are used in memorial practice. Secondly, cultural remembrance and cultural amnesia brings together research that investigates how cultural change is shaped by the continued effects - both by rediscovery and re-introduction - of cultural repertoires from the past (such as those of Romanticism or the Baroque) and how cultural dynamics often evolve around the return of repressed or forgotten cultural scenarios. Thirdly, research in the context of media and aesthetics studies both how digital technologies give rise to new aesthetic forms, and how digital aesthetics structure the social and cultural participation of media audiences. As such, it investigates how the dynamics of cultural memory formation is currently being redefined in the context of new media, for instance through new mechanisms of bottom-up canon formation through contemporary fan practices. Finally, a number of projects share an interest in (life) writing and biography , either by engaging in the actual writing of biographies and theorizing of life writing, by using the model of the biography to investigate a form of material culture (like the cultural biography of the city of Maastricht or the biographical study of the lives of contemporary artworks in the context of their conservation), or by investigating the cultural constructions of life-stages like childhood and old age. 2. Composition of the research group AMC is a multidisciplinary group representing literary and arts studies, philosophy, history, and media studies. Like the other programmes, AMC has grown considerably over the assessment period. A new special chair was created, 95 As in the other research programmes of FASoS, these themes do not divide the research programmes into separate groups. The research projects run across several of the labels and an event organised by one group will usually involve other researchers of AMC (and the other research programmes) as well. 91 Art & Media (R. van de Vall). Apart from new colleagues joining the faculty, our growth results from the integration of the Centre for Gender and Diversity (CGD) and the transfer of some colleagues who formerly participated in the PCE group (see Table 34).

Research environment and embedding The Arts, Media and Culture programme is solidly embedded in the faculty's curricula, both our BA Arts & Culture and several MA programmes (such as the Research Master Cultures of Arts, Science, and Technology, and the Masters in Media Cultures, in Arts and Heritage and in Arts and Sciences). There are close collaborations with members of the other research programmes. In particular, research on media and aesthetics is closely connected with STS and VKS-M; research on memorial politics and transnational history with PCE. We also welcome the Globalisation and Development Initiative, which will become a fourth research programme. In fact, our programme, which contains a number of globalisation-related topics, underscores that globalisation, like gender and diversity, is developing into a perspective that penetrates many topics of cultural research. AMC also contributes significantly to the three thematic profile areas recently defined by Maastricht University: 'Quality of and Innovation'.96 Moreover, the interdisciplinary approach and social orientation of AMC fit the Maastricht profile seamlessly. In terms of national research agendas, AMC research is in line with two thematic research priorities set by the Dutch college of university rectors, namely 'Culture, identity and integration' and 'International legal order', while it also ties in with two of the strategic themes of NWO 96 See Annex K.4 for further information on the thematic profile areas defined by our university. 92 ('Samenleven onder spanning' and 'Leven in gezondheid') and with one of the government priority areas, 'Life sciences'. Another way of characterizing a research programme is by its international and national affiliations. The great variety of scholarly associations of this research group includes: The International Research Society for Children's Literature (IRSCL); The Society for Literature, Science and Art (SLSA); The Historical Association of South Africa (HASA); German Studies Association (GSA); Association for the Study of Nationalities (ASN); the European Association of Social Sciences and Technology (EASST); the German Association for Applied Image Studies (Angewandte Bildwissenschaften); the German Association of Semiotics (DGS); the German Association for Media Studies (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Medienwissenschaft); the International Society for the History of Rhetoric, the Leonardo da Vinci Society, London; the International Association for Aesthetics. We are also involved in the relevant national research schools. More closely related to our actual research projects are the specific international research projects and networks our researchers participate in. From 2000 - 2007, for instance, dr. G. Verbeeck headed the international project 'Occupation in Europe: The Impact of National Socialist and Fascist Rule', funded by the European Science Foundation. From 2006 onwards, prof. dr. R. Zwijnenberg has participated in the Brainhood Project, an international and interdisciplinary research group on the 'cerebral subject'. Our researchers are increasingly active in building such networks, like The European Network in Ageing Studies, initiated with NWO funding by dr. A. Swinnen, the Platform for the Cultural History of Children's Media, initiated with NWO funding by dr. L. Wesseling and the International Network for PhD Candidates and Postdoctoral Researchers in the Field of Contemporary Art Conservation, initiated by dr. V. van Saaze. 4. Quality and scientific relevance Table 35 below highlights five significant results of our programme, followed by a selection of five books and five journal articles, that we consider good illustrations of the quality and significance of the work of the AMC programme throughout the years. As thematic shifts always take some time to manifest themselves in publications and other results, the tables also give an impression of the 93 programme's development, from an emphasis on the interconnections of arts and literature with science and technology to the focal point of cultural memory and diversity.

Output of the programme As has long been customary in the humanities, members of this programme tend to publish more books or chapters in collected volumes than journal articles; they also cherish their societal role by publishing in Dutch and in professional publication venues. Since the start of the period under review, they are very much stimulated to widen their influence by publishing in international peer- reviewed journals. The effect is noticeable from 2007 onwards, when the number of refereed journal publications starts to increase significantly.97 At the same time, we have kept up our large output in professional publications, in line with our societal focus and efforts in valorisation. Nevertheless there is certainly room for improvement, as also in 2010 the number of non-refereed book chapters still outweighs the refereed category. Like the other programmes, and in order to create more coherence and visibility of our research group we set up a list of ten focal point journals in 2009. The list intends to do justice to the whole research area covered by the group.98 97 See annex AMC-F.2 for an overview of the journals in which refereed articles were published and for their ranking in the ERIH list. 98 The list includes: Convergence: the International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies (not included in ERIH); European Journal of Womens' Studies (ERIH -A); Critical Inquiry (ERIH-A); History and Memory: Studies in Representations of the Past (ERIH-B) Journal of Visual Culture (ERIH-A), Philosophy and Public Affairs (ERIH-A); European Journal of Cultural Studies (not included in ERIH); Representations (ERIH-A); Literaturwissenschaft (ERIH-A). The effects of this list on the output are not very visible yet, although several publications in Arcadia were realised. 95 Table 36: Publications output AMC 2005-2010 (including CGD) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Refereed articles 3 2 2 7 7 9 Refereed books 0 1 0 1 0 0 Refereed book chapters 3 0 1 2 5 2 Editorship refereed journal 0 0 0 0 0 1 Editorship refereed book 0 0 0 0 1 0 Refereed publications (total) 6 3 3 10 13 12 Non-refereed articles 13 22 11 14 6 8 Non-refereed books 1 1 0 2 8 2 Non-refereed book chapters 17 28 22 12 19 13 Editorship non-refereed journal 2 1 2 1 0 0 Editorship non-refereed book 2 4 2 0 1 0 Non-refereed publications (total) 35 56 37 29 34 23 PhD thesis 1 0 0 0 2 1 Professional publications 45 66 68 53 98 97 Total 87 125 108 92 147 133 Table 37: Publication output AMC 2005-2010 per research fte 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Refereed publications per research fte99 0.53 (0.78) 0.23 (0.33) 0.24 (0.37) 0.68 (1.00) 0.70 (1.04) 0.65 (0.98) Refereed publication 7% 2% 3% 11% 9% 9% 6. Earning capacity Members of this programme are stimulated to acquire research funds. Information on sources of money is sent around and assistance in writing proposals is consistently offered, by the senior members of the programme as well as by faculty- and UM officers whose services are often used. This leads to a climate of enthusiast grant-writing with considerable financial success, while also having a positive effect on career perspectives. Table 38 shows the funding secured by the research group during the assessment period. 99 Refereed publications = refereed journal articles, refereed books, and refereed book chapters. The figures in brackets show the values if PhD candidates are excluded. 96 Table 38: Funding AMC 2005-2010 in k\u20ac (including CGD, turnover)100 2005 2006 2007 funding (1) 531.4 657.4 Centre for Gender and Diversity, now integrated in AMC, has been successful in acquiring contract research (3), as is visible in the acquisitions in the years 2005-2007. The research group AMC had been successful in NWO through the acquisition of a series of grants by R. Zwijnenberg and R. van de Vall in the years 2001 to 2008.101 After 2008 we see a series of successful applications at NWO by van de Vall (awarded in 2008), Wenz (2009), Wesseling (2010), Verbeeck (2010) and Swinnen, Hendriks et al. (2010).

Academic reputation Indications of the academic reputation of our researchers are prizes and awards, academic roles, participation in scholarly networks, and invitations for prestigious lectures. Members of the programme are frequently invited for NWO grant committees, programme committees and advisory boards; KNAW committees and QANU/NVAO visitation or accreditation boards. Many of them are members of editorial boards of scholarly journals or executive boards of scholarly societies. Table 40 offers a selective overview of some of these roles:103 Table 40: Some AMC prizes and academic roles as an indication of scholarly reputation104 Researcher Prizes A.

Societal relevance: quality, impact and valorisation Our programme has always attached great importance to the societal role of the humanities. We subscribe to the ideas expressed in the report Sustainable Humanities (2008) that the humanities are indispensable, not only as food for thought, as an economic resource, as a source of joy, or as a form of institutionalised cultural memory and self-reflection, but also as a means to the analysis and solution of many important social problems. We believe to be working along these lines. Next to well-tried venues like participation in public debates, lecturing for professional or general audiences and advising in the cultural sector, we find our researchers increasingly collaborating with institutional partners outside the university in designing and executing research projects. This is a promising direction for the future. Table 41 gives an overview of some AMC flagship projects in this respect and details their societal engagement. Table 41: Some externally funded AMC projects with explicit societal engagement, 2005-2010 Researcher Project Type of funding Kind of societal engagement R. van de Vall, V. van This project studied how contemporary art works (such as performances, installations and media art), which often cannot or even should not be preserved in a supposedly 'authentic' state, are currently conserved in museums.

The project studied gender-inequalities in specific scientific fields or at specific universities, including our own, and suggested strategies of closing the gender gap at universities. A. Swinnen 'Wel oud, niet out! De intimiteit en seksualiteit Department for Elderly, Belgian Province of Limburg. Multidisciplinary symposium on the sexuality of older people for older people, professionals and academics. There are a number of other projects to be mentioned in this context: The project 'Voorbij Autonomie en Taal ' (Beyond Autonomy and Language) - Hendriks, Hendrikx, Kamphof and Swinnen, funded by NWO ZON/MW, develops an interdisciplinary, partly hermeneutic, partly ethnographic approach to study practices of dealing with dementia and aims to translate its results in a performance for people with dementia and their caregivers in the Dutch Alzheimer caf\u00e9s. 99 The NWO funded project 'New strategies in the Conservation of Contemporary Art' was developed and is being executed together with the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage (ICN, now part of Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands RCE). It studies the ways museum conservators deal with contemporary artworks; its researchers are frequently engaged in collaborative projects with institutions such as the Netherlands Institute for Media Art, Stichting Restauratie Atelier Limburg and the MARRES Centre for Contemporary Culture at Maastricht. The historian dr. P. Calj\u00e9 participates in a large community project subsidised by the Province of Limburg in the Netherlands on Maastricht's potential as capital of culture. Dr. U. Brunotte acted as a scientific advisor for a large exhibition on the theme 'Heroes' which involved many museums and old factories in the Ruhr area in the Spring and Summer of 2010. During the last years dr. K. Wenz introduced teachers, parents and social workers in Germany to online gaming. This work for the public has led to an invitation to the Kulturpolitischer Bundeskongress (June 2011) in Berlin. Our societal role is an important reason to continue publishing in Dutch for a wider audience, next to internationally oriented English publications. We feel that both publication forms should be recognised in their own right. Dutch publications do serve scholarly aims, but they also enable us to valorise our work in the Netherlands and Belgium. The biographers in this programme write books that attract great public interest, such as prof. dr. W. Kusters's biography of Pierre Kemp, prof. dr. Meijer's biography of M. Vasalis and dr. J. Perry's books on memory culture and on his biographical subject Theun de Vries. P. van der Steen's book Hitlers Keurkinderen was an important new piece of research as well as an attractive book for a larger audience. Dr. S. Koenis's books constructively feed debates on democracy and integration in the Netherlands. Prof. dr. M. Doorman's NRC-Handelsblad (newspaper) series on graves of philosophers was well appreciated. 100 Table 42 gives an overview of some of these interviews, while Table 43 highlights some other societal roles of AMC researchers.

During the 2005 assessment (in which our group was rated high on productivity and lower on internal coherence), the review committee advised to seek unifying themes (such as \"Aesthetics\", \"Media\") that would put the programme in a more competitive position for external funds, and to highlight the profile 'media culture' more. This advice has been followed. The programme has been revised, its name was changed into 'Arts, Media and Culture', a chair in Art & Media was established (held by Renee van de Vall) and the focal point of research 'Cultural Memory and Diversity' - installed in the course of 2008 - has indeed provided more coherence and common aims. The social relevance of the programme has become much more prominent, and publication output and acquisition rates have improved. We successfully tackled several challenges, such as the departure of two productive professors and the integration of the Centre for Gender and Diversity. Although there remains enough to improve on, our current vibrant research 106 See annex AMC-I.1 for a full overview of all advisory and other roles for a non- academic audience. 102 culture gives us all reason to be confident about our future, notably with regard to exploration of new directions, promising crossovers between the humanities and the social sciences, and interesting new forms of societal valorisation. Funding for Cultural Memory and Diversity as a focal point has been effectively used as 'seed money'. First, it was used to reduce some teaching duties of members for the writing of new research proposals. These incentives (R. van de Vall, V. van Saaze, E. Wesseling, A. Swinnen) resulted in the acquisition of several NWO research and network grants. Other incentives (to Hengel, Saloul, Prange) led to VENI applications of which one is still under review at the time of writing. We also organised research trips, participation in conferences abroad, and research days and conferences in Maastricht featuring guest researchers from abroad. Finally a PhD candidate with an innovative Cultural memory-profile (Beckers) could be attracted to our research effort on Memorial Politics by providing part of the necessary co-financing with the Duitsland Instituut (Institute for German Studies) in Amsterdam. As pointed out, the organisation of the programme combines an overall framework with a flexible clustering of smaller groups and initiatives. The general colloquium of Arts, Media and Culture is scheduled once in every three weeks. It features a lecture by one of the members, by distinguished colleagues from abroad or other universities in the Netherlands or presents a recently acquired new research programme, always with responses by internal or external referees. Thus the group supports ongoing research efforts of its members and actively socializes its PhD candidates into academic life. We hosted two visiting researchers from India and Italy respectively. Next to this, concentrated working parties meet around a specific theme or on a proposal that is to be developed. Several of these have organised small symposia. There are series of research lunches on gender and diversity-themes and regular research sessions of the Media and Aesthetics group. This mixed format has proven very fruitful and has strengthened the cohesion of the programme as a whole. 103 Table 44: Numbers of AMC staff at various levels, December 2010 Academic function Number Full professors 2 Part-time and special professors 1 Associate professors 6 Assistant professors, tenured 10 Assistant professors, tenure track 1 Assistant professors, temporary 0 Postdocs 9 PhD candidates 8 Concerning the composition of our research group, the relatively small number of full and special professors is a matter of concern (Table 44). While at the end of the current evaluation period (December 2010) we have two full professors (Kusters, Meijer) and one special professor (van de Vall), this number will drop to one and a half in 2012 because of the retirement of Wiel Kusters and the reduction of working hours by Maaike Meijer. On the other hand, two special chairs (Koenis and Cornips) will be added at the end of 2011. Further compensation in professorial power can be realised by speeding up the hiring procedure of the vacant chair of Wiel Kusters, by promoting an associate professor of high quality to a 'profileringsleerstoel' and by seeking to acquire at least one more special chair, the 'Opzijleerstoel'. We hope that in 2013 a new professor for the Centre for Gender and Diversity (CGD) can be hired as a successor of Maaike Meijer. This means that we aim at an acceptable level of three fulltime chairs and three special ones. This will allow us to provide sufficient PhD supervisors and strengthen our organisational structure. 104 10. SWOT analysis Strengths (what are we good at?) x Stimulating research culture, coherent and active research initiatives with clear targets. x Quality and quantity of the output of the programme. x High capacity to valorise results in societal terms. x Growing earning power in the second money stream. x Capacity to adapt and change innovative and sometimes unique topics of research which are at the frontline of the most recent expressions of culture (such as fan fiction, social media, digital dance, smart environments and how to interpret their social effects). x Clear profile: a humanities programme with a social focus; fruitful methodological crossovers between humanities and social sciences. Weaknesses (where are we weak?) x Not all of the AMC members are part of an active research group yet. x The overall coherence is not explicit enough. x We should publish more in international refereed journals. x Valorisation of humanities research in economic terms. x Not enough professors. Opportunities (what chances for improvement may appear?) x Collaboration with the Globalisation and Development Initiative. x Get European funding. x To develop a specific Maastricht form of interdisciplinarity, an approach that combines humanities and social sciences. x Significant growth in the research on Conservation of Contemporary Art, Age Studies, societal projects on dementia. Threats (what developments might threaten us when we would not react adequately?) x Decreasing government funding for arts and culture may reduce. possibilities for collaboration with art institutions. x Dependency on external funding may weaken internal coherence. 105 11. Strategy Improving our funding base : We have shown that we can acquire funds from the NWO. A new NWO funded project on 'Terrorscapes in Postwar Europe. Transnational Memory of Totalitarian Terror and Genocide' (dr. G. Verbeeck) will start in 2011 and several other proposals are being prepared. In this, we will have to take account of the fact that our 'natural' partners outside academia, art institutions like film houses and museums, may have less time and resources to spend on research because of government cuts in the arts sector. However, new socially relevant research areas will continue to provide opportunities for further growth, in particular along the lines of the current NWO-funded projects. Follow- up grant proposals on the conservation of contemporary art are already in the making and the field of age and dementia studies opens up a range of new possibilities. We do intend to send more proposals to NWO in the near future, yet we will also have to try and throw the nets wider. The next step well be to conquer the academic (and not only the cooperation- and applied-) EU funds. We initiated an ECR Advanced Grant application (written by Nederveen, but now pursued within the Globalisation and Development Initiative where it fits better). Next in line is a co-operation in the field of theatre studies (Vanhaesebrouck) and a EUROCORES Theme Proposal for a European Collaborative Research on Children's Media. The European Network in Ageing Studies is developing a proposal for a Marie Curie Initial Training Network and the contemporary art conservation researchers have recently submitted an international network proposal. We continue to support our young colleagues in grant writing in line with the faculty's policies. Strengthening internal coherence and viability : We want to continue with stimulating the format of small-group initiatives, but also strengthen the internal coherence. This will become extra important in the future, as an increased emphasis on external funding will make us more dependent on the research priorities of funding organisations rather than our own. We already meet with the senior researchers on specific topics like selection of graduate school candidates; we will do so more regularly in the form of a programme executive board. The colloquium will be made more attractive with high-quality events featuring important scholars from abroad. Moreover, we will start with an annual internal 'Summer-harvest' (we are borrowing the idea from the STS-colleagues) where an overview of everyone's work is given in short presentations. 106 We want to build and strengthen the existing links with the PCE and the STS groups, and we are looking forward to strengthening the dimension of Globalisation and Development in our programme in interaction with the new fourth research programme of FASoS. Improving the output of international publications : Existing procedures to support our younger colleagues - in planning their research career, publishing internationally and writing grant proposals - will be more consistently and intensely implemented by organising regular workshops. We will make more effective use of the list of focal point journals, both by re-examining the selection of journals and by stimulating our researchers to publish in them. Improving valorisation : Finally, we will look for possibilities to translate our societal relevance in economic terms, for instance by anticipating on funding schemes in the EL&I sector Creative Industries, which might offer good opportunities to look for partners in the commercial sector. Limited means to valorise in economic terms might be a weakness of all the humanities, but as the report Sustainable Humanities argued: there is more to valorisation than profit in the economic sense. We want to continue on our chosen path of making our research societally relevant through interviews, public lectures, expositions and collaboration with a host of institutions in public life. 107 II.4 The Globalisation and Development Initiative (GDI) 1. Objectives and research area The Globalisation and Development Initiative (GDI) was established in October 2008, to bring together new and existing research conducted within the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences focusing on the Global South. The Global South refers to developing countries as well as recently emerging economic powers such as Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). In the past two years the GDI has focused on consolidating both research and teaching in the field of Globalisation and Development within the Faculty and making FASoS one of the important players within Maastricht University in this field which has been identified as part of the University's strategy for 2011-2015. While its geographic grounding is the Global South, the GDI's research approach centres on exploring the linkages between the Global South and the rest of the world as well as within the Global South. Researchers use political economy and transnational approaches to investigate such linkages. A commonality is that research is strongly grounded in empirical, primary data collection work ranging from anthropological qualitative fieldwork to sociological quantitative surveys. A characteristic of the group, setting it apart from other globalisation and development research groups in the Netherlands, is its track record in interdisciplinary research using mixed methods that integrate the aforementioned methods. While globalisation and development are very broad categories, research in the GDI focuses on three specific areas which give the initiative its own distinctive profile. The first area of concentration is transnational migration. Research projects investigate the linkages that are created between places and phenomena in migrant sending and receiving countries. This research aims to re-frame migration research that is usually conducted within a nation-state framework and does so by focusing on the every-day lived experiences of migrants and the people they are tied to in their countries of origin as well as elsewhere. Research is based on empirical investigations and multi-sited research designs. A second area of focus is the interaction between transnational movements and local civil society actors such as non-governmental organisations and indigenous groups in the fields of environment and health. 108 The research projects focus on local actors fighting for their rights to health care and the protection and access to indigenous lands and natural resources against large multi-national corporate interests. A third theme is research on transnational cultures of development. This theme focuses on BRIC countries and their emerging roles in setting development agendas and redefining a new world order. The research projects use a political economy perspective. 2. Composition of the research group The GDI came into existence in 2008 and has been growing since. Its core team currently consists of one full and one part-time professor, one assistant professor, two postdoctoral researchers and four PhD candidates. The GDI therefore is not yet of the same size as the three existing research programmes (Table 45). The GDI researchers are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, such as anthropology, sociology, development economics, history and international political economy and thus feed into the faculty's tradition of interdisciplinary research. Table 45: Research staff Globalisation and Development Initiative 2005-2010 in fte* 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Tenured staff - - - 0.2 0.6 0.6 Non-tenured staff - - - 0.2 1.0 1.9 PhD candidates - - - 0 0.8 3.3 Total - - - 0.4 2.4 5.8 * On 31 December of the year concerned As explained in part I of this report, the GDI will receive a boost both from the recently accredited Master Globalisation and Development Studies starting in the academic year 2011/2012 and from its intended upgrade to a fourth research programme. At this moment it seems safe to say that the staff size of the GDI will continue to grow over the years to come, although the speed of that growth is difficult to foresee under the current financial conditions. 109 3. Research environment and embedding The GDI is building linkages with FASoS's three existing research programmes, other faculties in Maastricht University as well as internationally. It is in the process of developing research projects on migration and the use of technology, which would build on the group's expertise on transnational migration research and the STS group's expertise on the social construction of technologies. The GDI has also been involved in helping to create a research line within the AMC programme on international adoptions which combines empirical fieldwork in developing countries with literary approaches to the study of discourses on international adoptions. The GDI, together with researchers in PCE, the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance, the Faculty of Law and the School of Business and Economics, is creating a university-wide centre on migration research combining northern and southern perspectives. Finally, the GDI has been involved in developing the university's thematic profile area Europe and a Globalising World107 and is one of the key players in making Globalisation and Sustainable Development an active research and teaching theme within the university. In this way the GDI is well embedded in Maastricht University's profile area \"Europe and a Globalising World\". Research collaborations exist between the GDI and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance and new collaborations are sought with UNU-MERIT.108 The GDI has a close relationship to teaching within FASoS through participation in the Minor on Globalisation and Development and was central in the establishment of the recently accredited Master of Globalisation and Development Studies. These two programmes benefit from GDI faculty bringing their research to bear on the teaching and vice-versa. In addition, these programmes provide the GDI with new cohorts of potential researchers. Further fruitful research-teaching interactions have been achieved through FASoS's honours programme where students have been involved in research initiatives of the GDI. Internationally, the GDI is involved in many institutionalised research collaborations with universities in Europe and in the Global South, notably Africa, India and South-East Asia (see details in academic reputation section). 107 See Annex K.4 for further information on the thematic profile areas defined by our university. 108 A part of the United Nations University. 'Merit' stands for Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology. 110 4. Quality and scientific relevance The GDI has organised various international workshops and conferences, establishing itself as an international player especially in the field of transnational migration. It has also been active in publishing the results of its research. Some highlights of our work in the two-year period of the GDI's existence and some especially significant publications (focusing on key journal articles and other publications) are mentioned in Table 46 below.109 Table 46: Selection of especially significant GDI results and publications Researcher Selected highlights Date of activity V.

Output The GDI has been productive in terms of publications and is distinctive in the proportion of peer reviewed publications. Already at its inception, the GDI produced one third of its total publications in international, peer reviewed publications.111 In 2010 this grew to almost 60%. Also in terms of output per fte the GDI scores high with 3.33 peer reviewed publications per research fte in 2009 and 1.90 in 2010. These numbers are quite higher (4.71 and 4.07 respectively) if one excludes PhDs. Furthermore, most of the international, peer reviewed journals in which GDI researchers publish have impact factors that are above the average for the discipline to which they belong attesting to the high scientific quality of the research output. 110 Because of its shorter period of existence and because of the smaller staff numbers of the GDI in comparison to the other programmes we have chosen to present only three instead of five key publications in each category. 111 See annex GDI-F.2 for an overview of the journals in which refereed articles were published and for journal impact factors. 112 Table 47: Publications output GDI 2005 - 2010 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Refereed articles - - - 5 5 8 Refereed books - - - 0 0 0 Refereed book chapters - - - 1 2 2 Editorship refereed journal - - - 1 0 0 Editorship refereed book - - - 0 1 1 Refereed publications (total) - - - 7 8 11 Non-refereed articles - - - 0 1 0 Non-refereed books - - - 2 0 0 Non-refereed book chapters - - - 8 18 7 Editorship non-refereed journal - - - 0 0 0 Editorship non-refereed book - - - 1 1 0 Non-refereed (total) - - - 11 20 7 PhD thesis - - - 0 0 0 Professional publications - - - 3 2 1 Total 21 30 19 Table 48: Publications output GDI 2005 - 2010 per research fte 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Refereed publications per research fte112 - - - n.a. 3.33 (4.71) 1.90 (4.07) Refereed publications as percentage of all publication 33% 27% 58% 6. Earning capacity Despite its recent establishment, the GDI has been effective in acquiring external funding from a number of funding institutions. Table 49: Funding GDI 2005 - 2010 in k\u20ac (turnover) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Direct funding (1) - - - 34.6 189.0 396.7 Research grants (2) - - - - 76.3 104.0 Contract research (3) - - - - 23.4 187.6 Total funding - - - 34.6 288.7 688.3 112 Refereed journal articles, refereed books and refereed book chapters. 113 The turnover figures given in Table 49 do not adequately reflect the successes that the GDI has had in acquiring external funding, which is why we give an overview of some major grants that were obtained since 2008 (Table 50). The GDI has been particularly successful in obtaining highly competitive grants from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the European Commission. In this respect GDI scores highly compared with other research groups on globalisation and development in the Netherlands. There were also some smaller yet highly competitive grants obtained by Djamila Schans (\u20ac 15,000,- from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for a project on African migrants in Japan) and by Veronica Davidov (\u20ac 9,000,- for a Fulbright Scholarship for a project dealing with ecotourism in Russia).

Academic reputation The reputation of the GDI is partially demonstrated by the number of institutions it collaborates with in research projects. This is fundamental in the field of globalisation and development in the way it is conducted within the GDI as multi- sited research requires local institutional grounding. These collaborations also provide the pillars on which future research collaborations are built as well as provide local supervision for students in our MA Globalisation and Development Studies when they conduct their fieldwork. Institutions with which GDI has active research collaborations are the Centre for Migration Studies, University of Ghana 113 See annex GDI-G.2 for a full overview of all acquired grants. 114 at Legon; Department of Political and Social Sciences at Pompeu Fabra University Barcelona; Department of Demography at Ile-Ife University, Nigeria; Institute for Social Sciences, University of Lisbon, Portugal; Sussex Centre for Migration Research, University of Sussex, UK; Department of Sociology at Kalyani University, West Institut National d'Etudes D\u00e9mographiques (INED), Paris, France; D\u00e9partement des sciences de et du D\u00e9veloppement at the Universit\u00e9 Catholique Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium ; Graduate School of NGO Studies at Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea; and Department of Child Psychology at University College Cork, Ireland. The GDI is also a reference point for research on transnational migration in the Netherlands. This can be seen by a large number of invitations to other universities both to hold lectures on transnational migration and to become a member of PhD viva committees. The international reputation of its senior researchers also contributes to the reputation of the GDI. Jan Nederveen Pieterse is internationally one of the most well-known contemporary theorists of globalisation and development. Valentina Mazzucato is regularly asked to speak at academic and public venues on issues of migration and development.

Societal relevance: quality, impact and valorisation A general ambition of the GDI is to provide societal relevant knowledge that can inform policy makers and public debate. For example, one of the tenets of GDI research on migration is that migration is talked about in a very narrow perspective in public and policy debates. GDI research contributes to changing the way migration is thought and talked about by showing how a transnational perspective opens up new conceptualizations of migration, highlights different questions and issues around migration and shows that also non-migrants live transnational lives. GDI researchers aim thus to affect public debates and policymaking by participating in public events, engaging with policymaking, and carrying out some agenda-setting activities. Finally, GDI researchers engage, if possible and feasible, with the research populations by involving them in research agenda setting and engaging with them in the communication of research output. The research projects carried out under the GDI are at the initial stages but have already engaged in some activities to meet the aims stated above. GDI researchers participate in public events such as chairing the Society for International Development lecture on migration and development (February 2010); chairing a public conference on circular migration organised by migrant diaspora organisations (September 2010); or contributing to Her Majesty the Queen's Speech on the occasion of the State Visit of the President of Ghana (October 2008). GDI researchers moreover engage with policymakers by participating in policy-oriented conferences, such as the Swedish Presidency Kick- off Conference on Labour Migration and its Development Potential (Malmo, October 2009). Agenda setting is obtained by participating in decision-making bodies such as the World Connectors' working group on migration and development, a collection of influential people in Dutch society who are engaged in global issues; membership in the Social Science Research Council of the United States expert committee on migration and development; membership in the Prince Claus Foundation for Culture and Development which provides funds for artists and projects at the interstices of culture and development. Another way that research is valorised within GDI is by feeding research results back to the affected populations. This often requires special efforts and new dissemination methods as the populations involved are often low educated, illiterate and at times in hard-to-reach places. GDI researchers have helped to 116 develop television and radio talk shows on migrant media stations in Ghana and the Netherlands to bring issues of transnational child raising to a migrant public (November 2009, June 2010); a workshop was organised in which indigenous communities in tropical rain forests in Ecuador and Cameroon were brought together to exchange experiences in fighting for their ancestral lands and to bring forth their concerns in order to set research agendas (August 2010). Table 52: Some externally funded GDI projects with explicit societal engagement, 2005-2010 Researcher Project Type of funding Kind of societal engagement V. Mazzucato MAFE EU-FP7 Knowledge about migration trends between Africa and Europe feeds into EU policy initiatives. To this aim policy briefs are produced and policy dialogues organised both in Africa and in Europe. V. Mazzucato and D. Schans TCRA NWO Workshops with civil society organisations both in Ghana and in The Netherlands have been organised involving schools, orphanages, UNICEF, and various community organisations. Migrant media is used (tv and radio stations) to inform the research population about results and to receive their feedback. V. Mazzucato TCRAf-Eu NORFACE Migrant organisations in Portugal and Ireland are involved in disseminating information about the project to the research population. Policy briefs are part of the outputs envisaged. Training sessions are organised for junior researchers from African countries. 117 Table 53: Some GDI publications, activities and interviews for a non- academic audience115 Researcher Title Place V.

It has grown extremely rapidly from when it was created in 2008 with the hiring of one full-time full professor and a part-time special professor. The success it has had in acquiring external funding has enabled the GDI to grow especially in terms of PhD and Post doc researchers. This has led to a growth in ftes from 0 to 5,6 in only two years. The quality of the group is reflected in the high productivity in terms of international refereed publications in high-quality journals and the ability to acquire competitive international grants. Its track-record puts GDI in a good position for acquiring future grants. Furthermore, the recently accredited Master of Globalisation and Development Studies creates a clear link between GDI research and teaching at 115 See annex GDI-I.2 for a full overview of all interviews and GDI-J. for a full overview of all professional publications. 116 See annex GDI-I.1 for a full overview of all advisory and other roles for a non- academic audience. 118 FASoS. Finally, Maastricht University's profile area of 'Europe in a Globalising World' as well as the University's focal area of Globalisation and Sustainable Development put the GDI at the centre of the future University-wide initiatives and create fertile opportunities for growth and collaborations. There is now a need to consolidate the group by increasing the number of tenured staff (see Table 55). This will require more structural funding from the Faculty as well as a continued success in grant acquisition. A more structural position in the Faculty is being strived for by making the GDI into a fourth research theme. This will also help to increase its visibility within FASoS to the outside world, for example through the website and by allowing more events, such as hosting a visiting scholar, to take place under the rubric of FASoS. Table 55: Numbers of GDI staff at various levels, December 2010 Academic function Number Full professor 1 Part-time and special professors 1 Associate professors 0 Assistant professors, tenured 0 Assistant professors, tenure track 0 Assistant professors, temporary 1 Postdocs 2 PhD candidates 4 119 10. SWOT analysis Strengths (what are we good at?): Weaknesses (where are we weak)?: x Highly productive: many publications of high quality (ISI IF refereed journals; international top publishers). x High success rate in obtaining competitive, large grants; strongly placed for obtaining future grants at national and European levels. x Strong international collaborations with universities in Europe, Africa and Asia. x Rapid growth: in two years from 0 to 5,6 research fte and still growing. x Consists of young researchers with high potential. x Many fertile cross linkages with the existing research programmes (STS: migration and technology; technology and development; AMC: international adoptions; PCE: European migration policies and border regions). x The newly accredited Master in Globalisation and Development Studies provides the potential to create strong linkages between research and teaching. x Inadequate web visibility as 'group'. x Most ftes are non-tenured positions. x The GDI is in an initial phase and it now needs to be consolidated. It has not yet benefitted from 'group' activities such as a research seminar series or seed funding for research retreats or conferences (all funding has come from external research grants). Opportunities (what chances for improvement?): Threats: (which developments might threaten us?) x Two of the main themes of the GDI, migration and environment, attract much interest from students and potential PhD candidates. x Ample public interest and funding opportunities in two of the themes of the GDI: migration and environment. x UM wants to profile itself along the theme of Globalisation and Sustainable Development. x Dutch national funding for research severely cut, especially that related to development issues. x Faculty's financial situation in the medium-term may not allow for consolidation of the group through the needed growth in tenured ftes, and the establishment of group activities such as research seminars. 120 11. Strategy The prospects for maintaining the strengths of the GDI are good qua the calibre of the researchers it has attracted and the active collaborations that it has established with universities and institutes around the world. While the group has grown very rapidly, it needs to continue to grow in order to develop a stable and established presence within the faculty. There are various strategies to meet this goal: Attract top-quality researchers: The group's international reputation in specific areas of Globalisation and Development research has allowed it to attract top- quality PhD candidates and post-doctoral fellows. It is our ambition to enable these researchers to remain with FASoS by facilitating them in applying for research grants. The previous experience of senior faculty in the GDI in this area is an asset in this regard. Furthermore, faculty finances permitting we aim to promote at least one non-tenured faculty member to a tenure-track position and provide tenure to at least one tenure-track faculty member within the short term. This is necessary to create continuity within the GDI, to enable it to participate fully in G&D related courses in the MA Globalisation and Development Studies and MA European Studies. Structural establishment of the GDI within the Faculty : Making the GDI into a fourth research theme will allow the GDI to establish common activities such as research retreats and workshops on globalisation and development related issues. Moreover, we will establish a research seminar on Globalisation, Development and Transnationalism in place of the current brown bag lunches. The research seminar will be a place for senior scholars, also from outside of UM, to present their research. The transnational migration group colloquia continue to act as a place for PhD candidates to meet on a regular basis to discuss readings related to their topics and their own work. Improve web presence of GDI within the FASoS website: The GDI pages within the FASoS website will be revitalized; separate and interlinked websites pertaining to the large research programmes within GDI are being developed and will be linked to the GDI website; the website will give an overview of research projects and other research-related activities such as workshops or conferences, an overview of our seminar series, the international partners we work with and a link to the newly established Masters in Globalisation and Development. 121 Become a structural member of the national graduate school CERES: CERES is a consortium of Dutch university departments concerned with social science research on development issues. It provides training for PhD researchers. This is a way for GDI PhDs to become more involved in national activities as well as for GDI faculty to affect topics and methods in which PhDs are trained. Invite an internationally renowned researcher as a visiting scholar: Such a researcher would be involved in implementing a PhD summer school open to Dutch and international PhDs on a topic of high relevance to the GDI . He or she would engage with the GDI in helping it establish itself nationally as a focal point on globalisation and development research. Create research-teaching linkages : Research conducted within the GDI will be used to inform the teaching in the newly created Masters in Globalisation and Development Studies. GDI faculty are intensively involved in the teaching in the MA GDS, MA students will be required to attend the GDT research seminars; international research collaborations with institutions in Africa and Asia will serve to provide fieldwork opportunities for MA GDS students who choose to spend their second semester in a developing country. 122 123 Part III: The Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences III.1. Overview The establishment of the Graduate School for Arts and Social Sciences reflects our desire to offer a structured and professional supervision structure for our PhD candidates and to shorten the average time it takes our PhD candidates to finish their theses. These issues were already a point of attention in the 2005 assessment, after which the committee suggested to \"establish an assessment procedure of the performance of the PhD students ... in order to retain a strict supervision on the progress of the research\". The committee at the time was also \"confident ... that the number of completed PhD's will rise in the years ahead\". Based on these suggestions and our own objectives we decided to formalize our PhD training in a Graduate School. The School formally started on 1 January 2008 with eight PhD candidates117 and has been growing rapidly since then (chart 6). By the end of the assessment period, 40 PhD candidates were members of the Graduate School. The increasing number of PhD candidates was made possible by our successes in levering in research funding from external sources as well as our decision to fund a number of PhD places from our own sources. We want to continue along this path in the future and want to stabilize the school at a figure of about 60 PhD candidates (excluding external PhD candidates118) who are employed by our faculty. The Graduate School comprises all PhD candidates employed at or visiting our faculty and offers them a coherent and interdisciplinary teaching programme and a structured supervision scheme. 117 These eight members were the PhD candidates who had started their PhD trajectories after 1 September 2007. It was decided at the time that the PhD candidates who had started their PhD trajectories before that date would not be subject to the policies governing the Graduate School, but that they would fully participate in the training programme and social environment offered by the Graduate School. 118 External PhD candidates are typically people who have a job elsewhere, and write a dissertation in their free time. They are not members of the School, but may participate in its activities on request and at one's own expenses. 124 The PhD candidates are full members both of the research programmes and of the disciplinary departments in order to integrate them into the faculty as much as possible. Recruitment of our PhD candidates is open and internationally oriented. Every year the GS has an application round, for which it advertises a certain number119 of PhD positions in national and international media and on the relevant international mailing lists. The international advertising has led to a very international body of PhD candidates. Topics for research are suggested on the Graduate School's website120, but prospective candidates can also propose their own. Candidates were chosen in a three step-procedure during the assessment period.121 Apart from this application procedure, PhD candidates also enter the Graduate School by appointment to PhD places financed by externally acquired funds. Chart 6: Membership of the Graduate School, 2008-2010 119 Five in the 2007-2010 selection rounds, four in the recently concluded 2011 round. 120 See http://www.fdcw.org/phdprogram/ 121 Preselection by research programmes, OTO draws up a shortlist for an interview round, afterwards makes a final proposal on which the Faculty Board formally decides. In the 2011 selection round, the procedure was shortened to two steps (shortlisting by the research programmes, selection proposal by OTO after interview round). 125 Once selected, candidates are appointed as salaried employees (which is the normal status for PhD candidates in the Netherlands).122 PhD candidates are full members of one of the disciplinary departments and one of the faculty's Research Programmes. They attend the research colloquia and departmental meetings in the same roles as other academic staff. Candidates funded by faculty money can choose between a three-year appointment with no teaching obligations and a four-year contract including 1140 hours of teaching (equalling about 2/3 of the 1658 yearly working hours).123 Most take the latter option. Candidates funded by project money usually have a four-year appointment with no teaching obligations. Nevertheless, many candidates in this category choose to do some teaching. PhD candidates teach in the various BA and MA programmes of the faculty and sometimes also give lectures. We believe that the time to be invested in teaching is time well spent and will help the PhD candidates to make their next professional steps after graduation. We therefore encourage participation in the faculty's teaching programmes without making this an obligation. We have had large numbers of applicants for our positions (e.g. over 500 in the 2010 application round and about 360 in the 2011 round), both from within and without the university. This has allowed us to select very good candidates and it has led to a very international body of PhD candidates. III.2. Management Since its launch in 2008, the faculty's Research Director also acted as Director of the Graduate School. He is in weekly contact with the Academic Coordinator (responsible for the curriculum and daily management of the school). The OTO (explained in more detail in part I of this report) has so far functioned as the management body of the School which monitors the progress of PhD candidates, discusses policies related to the Graduate School, and has advised the Faculty Board on the recruitment of PhD candidates who are funded from the faculty's own resources. 122 This system makes PhD contracts relatively costly for the faculty and is one explanation for the relatively low numbers of PhD candidates in the past. 123 Included in these hours are preparation for classes and exam marking. For example, an 8 week course in the Bachelor is usually worth 45 hours in the faculty's time management system. 126 The Graduate School has a Confidential Advisor to whom PhD candidates can turn in case of problems with their supervisors. The HRM responsibility for the PhD candidates lies with the faculty's five departments, which means that the Director of the Graduate School has to be in close contact with the heads of departments (as well as of course the supervisors) in terms of progress monitoring (see section III.5. below). Managing the graduate school has become a formidable task in itself. Not only has the school grown quickly in terms of its size, we have also been active in setting up a structured curriculum within the school (see section III.4) and have introduced a number of formalised supervision and monitoring procedures (section III.5) which all require some preparatory work, attendance in meetings and aftercare. Graduate-school related matters therefore have required an ever larger amount of time and attention from the Research Director and the other OTO members. We have therefore taken the decision to set up a Board of the Graduate School in order to continue providing a professional supervision and management of the School and to be able to coach candidates and supervisors more extensively than has been done before. The Board's composition mirrors that of the OTO: It consists of a director, one member from each research programme and a PhD representative. The Board will take over the daily management of the School (progress monitoring, overseeing the curriculum, finances, and serving as an arbitrator in case of conflicts) and will participate in the selection of PhD candidates on faculty-funded positions. The confidential advisor keeps her position, but will not be a member of the GS Board. The members of the Board were appointed at the end of June 2011, so that the Board can become functional on 1 August 2011. III.3. Output As explained above, the establishment of the Graduate School was not least a response to our concern that we produced too few PhD degrees and that the average duration of a PhD trajectory was too long. While the last self-evaluation study (for the period 1998-2004) noted that \"the average duration of a PhD- trajectory ... is currently about seven years\", this number has been brought down in the meantime (see Table 56). However, we are still producing too few PhDs. 127 Table 56: PhD defences, 2005-2010 Enrolment Success rates - Graduation Total Star- ting year male/ female Total After less than 4 years # (%) After less than 5 years # (%) After less than 6 years # (%) After less than 7 years # (%) Gra- duated # (%) Not yet finished by end 2010 # (%) Dis- conti- nued # (%) 2001 2 2 2 (100) 2 (100) 2002 1 2 3 - 1 (33.3) 1 (33.3) - 2 (66.7) 1 (33.3) 2003 3 5 8 - 2 (25) 2 (25) - 4 (50) 3 (37.5) 1 (12.5) 2004 1 7 8 - 2 (25) 1 (12.5) - 3 (37.5) 3 (37.5) 2 (25) 2005 1 2 3 - 0 (0) - - - 3 (100) - 2006 0 1 1 - - - - - - 1 (100) Total 6 19 25 0 5 6 0 11 9 5 Completion took roughly 5 \u00bd years on average for those eleven candidates who started their PhD between 2001 and 2006124 and finished in the period 2005- 2010, while five PhD candidates who started between 2001 and 2006 stopped their PhD trajectory.125 There is however still a backlog of candidates who have not yet finished their theses. Three candidates of each the 2003, 2004, and 2005 classes were still working on their PhD theses by the end of 2010. Of those nine, five candidates have defended or will defend in 2011 (one from the 2003 cohort, all three of the 2004 cohort and one from the 2005 cohort). There was also one PhD defence from the 2007 cohort. If these candidates are included, the average duration of a PhD trajectory is 5 years and 8 months and the average number of promotions per year is 2.5.126 The completion rate within six years for the PhD candidates starting between 2001 and 2006 is 12/25 or 48% (including the 2005 candidate who submitted in 124 These base years were chosen in line with our goal that PhD candidates will have finished their thesis after 4 years of employment. 125 The reasons for dropping out vary. One of them discovered early on that his life plans were not compatible with a research career, and another (from the United States) became seriously homesick. Both terminated their employment within a year. One candidate got seriously ill and therefore had to stop despite having made good progress until this point. Two other previous PhD candidates are working successfully (as a consultant in Brussels and as a free artist) and lack the necessary time and enthusiasm to put the finishing touches on their work. We have invested considerable efforts in these two candidates and offered a variety of solutions. Even though there are still slight hopes that one day these two will submit, we think that \"discontinued\" is the most realistic assessment of their situation at this moment. 126 In absolute figures exclude external PhD candidates. Therefore, the number of PhD theses given in Table 5 in chapter I.7. (which includes external PhD theses) differs from these figures. 128 2011), which is reasonable if measured against the average for the humanities (rate of completion: 31% within 6 years)127. Still, this figure leaves room for improvement. Not included in these figures are external PhD candidates. The faculty has seen 6 external PhDs defend their theses in the period 2005-2010, and another two are expected in 2011, bringing the graduation rate for 2011 to at least eight successful defences. From the progress of the 2007 and 2008 cohorts who - other than the candidates to whom the output table above relates - have done their PhD within the supervision and curriculum structures of the Graduate School, we can conclude already now that it takes the candidates less time to finish their PhD theses within the Graduate School. A candidate of the 2007 intake year (who started his PhD on 1 January 2008) defended his thesis \"cum laude\" in June 2011, and other candidates from this cohort are also close to submission. We have seen only two candidates quit the Graduate School since 2008, in one case because of changing life plans and in one case in connection with work on the research plan, and both in their first year. We have formulated it as a strategic goal of the faculty to have about 12 dissertation defences on average per year (15 including external PhDs) by 2015. This number is significantly higher than in the years before the launch of the School, but we are confident that we can reach this target because of the larger intake of the school, and our intensive supervision which signals problems early on. Our graduation rate for 2011 - at least eight defences, quite possibly one or two more - also gives reason for optimism. We therefore believe that the problem of few PhD defences and a relatively long time to finish the work are more problems of the past than of the present and the future. 127 H. Oost & H. Sonneveld (2004). Rendement en duur van promoties in Nederlandse onderzoekscholen (p. 37). 129 III.4. Curriculum Our PhD candidates receive two kinds of training: first, the coursework related to their specific fields of research in National Research School (NRSs); second, general courses and skills as well as integration in day to day academic life in meetings organised by the Graduate Schools and our local research programmes. The existence of National Research Schools who cater for the more disciplinary training needs of PhD candidates and offer integration into the academic life of specific disciplines are a peculiarity of the Dutch PhD system. In contrast to our interdisciplinary Graduate School, the national research schools are organised along academic disciplines and bring together PhD candidates from all Dutch universities. They can therefore organise courses on sometimes quite specific disciplinary topics and debates which local schools could not organise at a reasonable cost. PhD candidates in the Netherlands receive funding from their home universities to enrol at a national research school. The most intensive engagement is in the first two years when candidates receive their training in the NRS, but they stay enrolled and can use the networking opportunities of the schools for the duration of their PhDs. The schools also have established academics as their members who are responsible for organising courses and workshops catering the individual training needs of the PhD candidates in various disciplines. Some PhD candidates also go to international summer schools in their respective areas. We are currently either a formal member of or send some of our PhD candidates to the following NRSs: x WTMC: Wetenschap, Technologie en Moderne Culture (Research School for Science, Technology and Modern Culture). For WTMC, FASoS is the lead institution ( penvoerder ).128 x NIG: Netherlands Institute of Government (for political and administrative sciences). x Huizinga Institute: Research Institute and Graduate School of Cultural History. x OSL: Onderzoeksschool Literatuurwetenschap (Research School for Literary Studies). 128 In 2011, WTMC was successfully re-accredited after an international review by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. 130 x Posthumus Institute: Research School for Economic and Social History. x NICA: Netherlands Institute for Cultural Analysis. x CERES: Research School for Resource Studies for Development. x NOV: Nederlandse Onderzoekschool Vrouwenstudies (Netherlands Research School of Women's Studies). x Moreover, we recently decided to join two research schools in foundation: The Research School for Media Studies (RMeS), and the OPG: Onderzoeksschool Politieke Geschiedenis (Research School for Political History). PhD candidates attend NRS courses a few times per year, often in sessions of several days. This has the additional advantage that it helps them build a network of fellow PhDs and professors outside our university. NRSs have built up lots of experience with graduate teaching and are generally functioning well. For these reasons, and for reasons of scale, we are keen on participating in NRSs and do not try to replace the system by local courses, as is the tendency in some local graduate schools. Our Graduate School also organises a local curriculum that complements those of the NRSs. Its function is supportive and integrative. The topics of the (usually bi-weekly) meetings topics are largely supradisciplinary. They can be practical (e.g. how to organise one's final year; how to turn a chapter into a journal article) or deal with specific skills which are of interest to researchers from various quarters. For example, the GS has organised training sessions on the case study approach, on QCA methods, and on ethnography as a method. Sometimes meetings can consist of debates on subjects of general interest, often at the occasion of university lectures by important intellectuals. Senior staff members are regularly involved in these meetings so as to foster an informal socialisation into the faculty's research community. PhD candidates can also organise meetings themselves, by inviting local or external professors to discuss new issues or methods, or by organising a small workshop (there is a special budget for these activities). One recent meeting was organised with PhD candidates from the EUI and Kiran Patel who will start as a Professor in European and Global History at the faculty in September 2011. Preparation for the GS meetings is kept light and attendance is not obligatory so as to avoid additional burdens. The main goal is to help young researchers integrate into the wider academic community, and to prevent the kind of isolation that has been a problem before. 131 Our PhD candidates report that they find the curriculum of the Graduate School highly useful and that they deem it an inspiring complement to what the national research schools have on offer. We have also learned that some of our PhD candidates are interested in visiting certain modules (mostly on specific methodologies) which are offered in the context of the two Research Masters of the faculty, and that some highly motivated research Master students are interested in what is going on in the Graduate School. We have therefore taken the decision that CAST and RMES (discussed in more detail in section I.10) will be integrated into the Graduate School into the medium-term. This means that PhD candidates may take selected courses from the MSc programmes in accordance with their supervisors and the Directors of Studies of the concerned programme. Vice versa, MSc students can be invited to selected events organised by the GS to bring them into closer touch with the next stage in a possible academic career. The objective of integrating the MSc tracks and the GS curriculum is to facilitate exchange with the research-oriented Masters of our faculty and to realise economies of scale where possible. We also want to make the transition from a Research Master to the \"third phase\" in university education a more obvious choice for highly talented Master students. However, in order to be admitted all our Research Master students will have to fulfil the same criteria of talent and academic skills that would be expected from any applicant to a PhD position in the Graduate School. III.5. Supervision and progress monitoring All PhD candidates are being supervised by a team of at least two staff members rather than individually (which used to be the norm). Usually there is some division of labour within a team. Candidates and supervisors also share the responsibility for the final progress report on PhD projects in the CAFE conference (see below). The daily contact with supervisors is complemented by some instruments through which the Graduate School structures the PhD trajectory and looks into candidates' progress at several points during their projects: 132 x The PhD candidates begin their employment by filling out a Training and Supervision Plan (TSP) together with their supervisor. This document129 fixes agreements on supervision, on additional training the PhD candidate wants or needs to receive, on the choice of the respective national research school, and establishes a firm schedule for regular meetings between candidate and supervisors. The document is signed by the supervisors and the candidate as well as the director of the graduate school, the head of department and the faculty's personnel officer and is put into the personnel file of the PhD candidate. The TSP can be changed later on in the trajectory if needed. x Six months after the start, each PhD candidate has to hand in a research plan, which formulates the main questions, embeds them in the literature, discusses a choice of methods, and provides a work plan and a time table for the rest of the project. The Research Plans which follow a certain predefined structure130 is evaluated by the OTO with the Graduate School's academic Coordinator in an advisory role. The OTO gives feedback and advises on a formal go/no go decision. This advice forms a basis for the first annual assessment interview (which all employees have with their department heads once a year). This meeting is special since it is used to decide whether or not to continue employment. The Research Plan requirement was introduced at the start of the GS. Our experiences are very positive. Not only has the plan helped to signal problems early, it also forces PhD candidates to put their projects on the rails immediately. The OTO has approved most Research Plans, and has asked for revisions a few times. Two PhD candidates from the Graduate School have decided to stop within a year, and in each case this decision was also instigated by work on the research plan. Hence painful lingering has been prevented and the candidates could be replaced. x At the end of their second year, candidates prepare a one-page progress report131 which also identifies plans for the next steps in the PhD trajectory, training needs and potential obstacles. This report serves as a basis for the annual assessment interviews in the second year. The OTO or the academic coordinator is not involved at this stage. We have just introduced this measure and cannot report experiences yet. x At the end of their penultimate year, candidates and their supervisors present the progress made and the timeline for finishing at a Coaching And Feedback (CAFE) conference .132 The purpose of these conferences is to get an overview of progress and to address any possible delay in finishing the thesis on time. An important element of the conferences is that the presentation and discussion of progress is a shared responsibility of both candidate and their academic supervisors. After the CAFE meeting, 129 See annex N.1 for a template of the TSP and a standard letter which all PhD candidates receive at the start of their employment. 130 See annex N.2 for a suggested structure of the research plan. 131 For candidates who choose a three-year contract the progress report is skipped in favour of the CAFE conference discussed in the subsequent bullet point. 132 See annex N.3 for more information on the CAFE conferences. 133 the OTO and the Graduate School's Academic Coordinator discuss the findings with the supervisors. On the basis of this, the OTO gives a progress report to the Faculty Board, and, if necessary, makes suggestions on adapting the plans. The GS Director later looks into follow-up on these suggestions. Both advices are stored in the candidate's personnel file, and are also used in the assessment interview of the final year.133 We have had two CAFE conferences so far. For external PhD candidates, the structures differ: They agree to a Training and Supervision Plan (TSP) just as a PhD candidate employed by the faculty would do. However, since they are not staff members, the research plan requirement, the progress reports and participation in the CAFE conference is not obligatory, and there are also no annual assessment interviews. We do however encourage the supervisors to apply the supervision and progress monitoring instruments of the Graduate School also to external PhD candidates. External PhD candidates are also invited to the CAFE conference, and during the most recent conference (in April 2011), one external PhD candidate and her supervisor presented. The GS also organises supervisors' meetings twice a year. These are used to inform staff about GS developments, and especially to exchange experiences and best practices. This is usually based on a kick-off presentation by experienced supervisors to which the audience reacts. The meetings are also intended to highlight the importance that the faculty attaches to the importance of PhD supervision and wants to avoid that supervisors are left alone with issues that they may face in the course of supervision. In addition, the university's career centre also offers courses on PhD supervision, and an increasing number of staff members have enrolled in these courses. 133 See annex N.3. 134 III.6. Research budgets One result of the 2005 assessment exercise was that more clarity on available funding was desired by the PhD candidates at that time. In response to this issue, the faculty clarified the availability of funding for the PhD candidates in a separate note.134 Nowadays, PhD candidates have access to several funds to support their research through which we want to stimulate and enable PhD candidates to visit conferences and to give presentations, to be able to go on field research trips, and to pay for some publication and editing-related costs. x Candidates financed by the faculty have a bench fee of \u20ac 5,000 for the duration of their project. Candidates who work on externally funded places have a research budget as part of their project. x As all staff members, PhD candidates have an annual personal budget from the department that they are a member of (\u20ac 500-1,000 per year). x The GS has additional funds for one conference visit a year, provided that the candidate gives a presentation. x The faculty helps cover the printing costs of the dissertation, and has funds for all academic staff for translations and special research costs. III.7. Job prospects Most previous PhD candidates of the faculty have found good employment, both inside and outside academia. Of the 11 PhD candidates who started their PhD between 2001 and 2006 and finished in the period 2005-2010, two have continued as postdoctoral researchers or lecturers at our faculty. Three took up research-related positions at the Free University of Brussels, the Max Planck Institute of Social Anthropology at Halle and at a museum in Leiden. One works as a docent at the Avantis Hogeschool in Tilburg, one in a management function at the Radboud University of Nijmegen, one as curator in a museum in The Hague, and three as advisors and consultants (at the Raad voor Maatschappelijke Ontwikkeling , Amsterdam, the Technopolis Group and as a freelancer). One of those three also is a lecturer at the University of Vienna. 134 Funding guide Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences (see annex N.4). 135 This means that the majority of our PhD alumni continued in research-related positions or as lecturers in academia, while others have used their training for work in museums or in management and consultancy functions. Concerning the current PhD candidates, a regular part of their assessment interview in the penultimate and the final years is to discuss future job prospects. Maastricht University's career centre offers (and pays for) centrally organised courses on career planning and labour market preparation. Concerning our own activities, we had a GS meeting in January 2011 with two PhD alumni who have taken up non-academic careers to showcase employment opportunities outside of academia, and we plan to have such a meeting at least annually. We are also busy re-establishing our ties with our PhD alumni, and once the new board of the Graduate School is in operation, these activities will certainly be intensified. Last, but not least, the faculty continues to offer a limited number of postdoc places, as described in chapter I.10. of this report (section Next Generation ). Two of the PhD graduates of 2005-2010 continued at our faculty, and the same is true for three graduates in 2011. One of the 2011 graduates continued as a postdoc at the Erasmus University Rotterdam. 136 III.8. SWOT analysis Strengths (What are we good at?) Weaknesses (Where are we weak) x High numbers of applicants to GS. x International mix of PhD candidates. x Combination of NRS training and local GS meetings caters for general and specialised training. x Our monitoring efforts have signalled problems early on. Problems with supervision have been dealt with sooner than in the old system. x Close integration of PhDs into the faculty as members of departments and research programmes. x Integration of supervisors into the work of the Graduate School. x PhD candidates become familiar and interact with very different disciplinary practices at our GS. x Our PhD candidates have found adequate employment after they left the Graduate School. x When compared to the staff numbers, we have seen too few PhD degrees in the past. x Relatively long duration of PhDs in the past, some candidates accepted before 2007 still working on their PhDs. x Up to now, we do too little on involving alumni in the Graduate School. Opportunities (what chances for improvement) Threats (what developments might threaten us?) x Completion rates and duration of PhD trajectories can be improved under the new teaching and supervision system. x The instruments of exchange possibilities with other Graduate Schools can be explored more. x The newly established Board of the Graduate School (in operation from 1 August 2011) can devote its full attention to the Graduate School. x Our efforts at increasing second and third money-stream funding will also help to generate more PhD places. x Our system is dependent on well- functioning NRSs. If these are shrunk, we do not have the critical mass of PhD candidates per discipline to replace their kind of education. x Cutbacks by the Dutch government have questioned our continued ability to finance PhD places from our own resources, especially since the status of PhDs as employees makes PhD places relatively costly. 137 III.9. Strategy The Graduate School has existed for some 3 \u00bd years now and the faculty has seen the first PhD candidate trained within the Graduate School successfully defend his PhD in June 2011. We feel that the Graduate School has led to a profound culture change in how we supervise our PhD candidates. Not only has it helped PhD candidates to make the most out of their years in the Graduate School, it has also put the relationship between PhD candidates and their supervisors much more into the focus. Although the trustful relation between candidate and supervisor remains the core of a successful PhD trajectory, the faculty is offering much more assistance and training along the way and puts a stronger focus on time management. We also feel that the progress monitoring scheme with the training and supervision plan at the start, the research plan after six months, and the several steps thereafter up to the CAFE conferences are helpful instruments. Still, all of these policies are new to the faculty and have a bit of an experimental character. We therefore appreciate the opportunity to put our Graduate School under the eyes of an external assessment committee for the first time. Concerning the outlook to the years ahead, the following issues will (continue to) preoccupy us: Giving further structure to the PhD trajectories : The policies discussed above relating to supervision and progress monitoring are working well in our view. Many of them are new to our faculty, and it requires both PhD candidates and supervisors to adapt and to make their experiences. As we continue with the Graduate School, we will continue both to learn from good practice elsewhere135 and to regularly review our own policies. Important benchmarks in this exercise will be the number and duration of PhD degrees, the number of dropouts, and - most importantly - the careers our PhD alumni make after they have left the Graduate School. Integration of the Research Masters: One way to increase the integration of research and teaching activities and at the same time to offer specialised training is the integration of our existing Research Masters into the Graduate School. 135 The academic coordinator and the director of the Graduate School have visited the Graduate Schools of the STS programmes at Cornell University, the MIT, and Zurich and the Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS) to exchange thoughts and to learn from their experiences. 138 In this way, MSc students get some first-hand experience with doing research and are immediately drawn into a research-oriented environment. We have also noted that some PhD candidates want to take specific courses from one of our Research Masters. Last but not least, there are possible synergy effects in the organisation of the two curricula. Consequently, we will integrate the two existing Research Masters RMES and CAST into the Graduate School. The question how to do this in the best possible way and how to make sure that the expectations sketched above are actually reached will be one of the concerns of the newly installed Board of the Graduate School. Relation to National Research Schools : We need to be aware of the changing structure of NRSs in the Netherlands. A recent memorandum signed by the deans of the humanities faculties and the national research schools in October 2010136 lays down agreements about the division of tasks between the NRSs and the local graduate schools which could imply a reduction of the disciplinary skills training offered by some of the national schools. At this moment the national policies are in flux, and the outcomes are difficult to estimate. Because of the diverse nature of our faculty we would face difficulties to step in should some of the more specialised national research schools discontinue (parts of) their teaching programme. This is not a matter of our expertise, but one of how to create the critical mass of PhD candidates to make such a structured curriculum viable. One possible scenario is that the local graduate schools in collaboration with local schools from other universities get together to organise a solution. Increase exchange of PhD candidates : The exchange of PhD candidates with other Graduate Schools is an area which we want to explore more in the future. At this moment our Graduate School profits from the manifold individual contacts of FASoS staff members when it comes to exchanging PhD candidates with other Graduate Schools, as well as from formalised but temporary networks such as the INCOOP Training Network funded by FP 7. There are at this moment no joint or double degree programmes in the Graduate School, even though the recently signed joint degree arrangements in the Research Master European Studies with the University of Cologne may open up such possibilities in the future. We will explore the issue what more formalised exchange programmes or a joint/double degree with other universities could offer to our Graduate School. 136 The two players involved are the Disciplineoverleg Letteren en Geschiedenis (DLG) and the Landelijke Overleg Geesteswetenschappelijke Onderzoeksscholen (LOGOS). 139 Increase alumni contact : Knowing how and what our alumni are doing after they have left the Graduate School is important in a variety of respects: First, we want to understand how the training and the academic socialization that PhD candidates received here has helped in the next steps of academic or other careers. The experiences our alumni make in their 'life after the PhD' can also help us to review our curriculum and our other policies. Second, alumni can be invited for special meetings integrated into the GS curriculum - either as teachers of specific skills or topics (this will be most appropriate for those alumni who have continued with an academic career) or as coaches who advise on career perspectives and on how to prepare for the time after the PhD employment at our faculty ends. These activities can form an important complement to the training by FASoS staff in the Graduate School. We are already now keeping contact to the PhD alumni who left Maastricht through a database and through informal contacts. We want to explore possibilities to intensify these contacts in the future, for example through regular Graduate School alumni days or through blogs. 140 141 Part IV: Research centres The main purpose of this section is to present a self-evaluation of a research centres associated to the faculty: The Sociaal Historisch Centrum voor Limburg (SHCL, Centre for the Social History of Limburg). The Centre keeps close intellectual and personal ties with the faculty, but is independent in financial and organisational terms and is also established at a different location in Maastricht (chapter IV.1). Moreover, we have also included brief non-evaluative chapters on the Centre for Gender and Diversity (CGD) which is housed by the Arts, Media and Culture programme, and the Maastricht branch of the Virtual Knowledge Studio (M-VKS) which was funded by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) until the end of 2010 and is currently merged into the research programme on Science, Technology and Society. The performance and output of these two entities was discussed in chapter II.2 and II.3 of this report already. Yet, these two centres have an independent intellectual profile and have at least for some time evolved outside of the faculty. These two aspects are explained in some more detail in sections IV.2 and IV.3 below. As explained above (section I.1), centres have a fairly narrow thematic focus and therefore do not define a specific focal point within their area of research. They are usually linked to structures outside of FASoS and are co-funded by some external partner. These partners can be government branches, foundations, or companies. These external links often lead to a strong emphasis on valorisation activities. The key goal in the establishment of centres is to open our faculty for collaboration with external partners, to highlight and organise specific research themes of direct societal interest and thus to make our faculty nationally and internationally visible. The way in which the centres have done this during the evaluation period is explained below. 142 IV.1 Sociaal Historisch Centrum voor voor Limburg (SHCL ) (founded 1949) is an independent research facility connected to the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS) of Maastricht University. It provides a research infrastructure for comparative regional history by giving access to historical sources, maintenance of a library collection, developing research, publication of a yearbook and a dissertation series. Its total staff (research, library, archives, facilities) amount to 12 fte. Its director, Professor Ad Knotter, holds a chair of comparative regional history at FASoS, and its head of research, dr. Willibrord Rutten, is on its staff. Both are employed by SHCL, however. In the previous assessment (2005) research at SHCL was evaluated as 'good'.137 The SHCL does research in the field of historical border studies and the comparative history of mining and mining regions . These fields are important for the understanding of the history of the cross-border region around Maastricht (today's Euregio Meuse-Rhine) and of modern Europe in general. The comparative approach enables the SHCL to connect with research institutes and universities elsewhere in Europe. There are many links with research and researchers at FASoS, both in the research programme Politics and Culture in Europe and Arts, Media and Culture. The SHCL programme thus adds to the European profile of the Faculty and contributes to the recently defined profile area of Maastricht University 'Europe and a Globalising World'.138 137 See annex D.1 for more information 138 See Annex K.4 for further information on the thematic profile areas defined by our university. 143 2. Composition of the research group As expressed above, the SHCL is an independent entity which however keeps strong personal and intellectual links with FASoS. One expression of this situation is the fact that PhD candidates supervised by SHCL staff are sometimes employed at FASoS (see Table 57). Table 57: Research staff SHCL 2005-2010 in fte* 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Tenured staff 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Non-tenured staff 0 0 0.3 0.9 0.9 0.3 PhD candidates** 2.3 2.2 2.4 1.6 0.7 0 Total 3.8 3.7 4.2 4.0 3.1 1.8 *On 31 December of the year concerned; ** employed by FASoS 3. Research environment and embedding Professional archival and library care can be only be secured by means of close cooperation with the State and Municipal Archives in the Historisch Centrum Limburg , which provides housing and facilities also for the SHCL. By strengthening the ties with FASoS in the field of teaching and research, SHCL is able to contribute to programmes of evidence based learning (MARBLE) of the faculty and attract more students interested in historical and archival work. The SHCL participates as a full member in the Netherlands-Flemish interuniversity Research School for Economic and Social History, the N.W. Posthumus Institute, in particular in its interuniversity research group 'People, Places & Spaces'. Moreover, the SHCL collaborates with research groups at universities in Belgium (Li\u00e8ge, Brussels), Germany (Aachen, Bochum), and the Netherlands (Nijmegen Centre for Border Research). Papers were presented at international conferences in Belfast, Steinhaus (South-Tyrol), Vienna, Lille, Ghent, Copenhagen, Swansea, and Nijmegen. 144 4. Quality and scientific relevance During the evaluation period three developments characterised the research of the SHCL: 1. Growing participation in international cooperative networks of research : The SHCL is a member of the international research network CHARME (Comparative Historical Analysis of Regional Mining Economies), organised by Swansea University, and with participants from several European universities working in this field. An application for a Marie Curie-grant (Initial Training Network) failed, but the network was able to organise several workshops and meetings. Within the ESF-network EUROCORECODE (European Comparisons in Regional Cohesion, Dynamics and Expressions), SHCL cooperates in a cooperative programme organised by the Nijmegen Centre for Border Research on 'The (de)construction of borders and unfamiliarity in the European Union'. Co-tutored by Prof. Knotter, a PhD-candidate started research on 'The cultural construction of cross-border Limburg (B and NL)' at Brussels University; SHCL participated/will participate in workshops, both of the programme and the network. Internationalisation will result in several international publications in 2011. 2. Growth of commissioned research, mainly on regional mining history: The most important were a project on the history of the largest private mining company in Limburg, the Oranje Nassau Mijnen and a social history project dealing with the Limburg miners, commissioned by the Stichting De Koempel Verhaalt (see section on Earning capacity ) below. In 2010 the Stichting Behoud Mijnverleden commissioned research on the effects of mine closures in Limburg in international perspective. 3. Own research projects in the field of 'border studies' and the 'comparative history of mining and mining regions': In 2008 Sophie Bouwens received her PhD on a dissertation supervised by prof. Knotter.139 She was awarded the prize for the best dissertation at Maastricht University in 2008-2009. SHCL coordinates a research programme on 'Mining labour markets in the Euregio Meuse-Rhine in the 20th century', funded by to Germany, 1958-2001]. 145 PhDs who are linked to the centre were appointed in Aachen, Brussels and Maastricht. Drs. Serge Langeweg en drs. Leen Roels, appointed as PhDs at Maastricht University in the period 2005-2010, are now finishing their PhDs on the Limburg and Li\u00e8ge districts respectively. They published several articles in leading historical journals. In 2009 the papers of a workshop on 'Migrant labour in the mining districts of the Belgian-Dutch-German borderland', organised by SHCL, were published as a the Tijdschrift voor Sociale en Economische Geschiedenis . In 2007, Dr. Erwin Steegen was added to the project as post-doc (0.3 fte), with the specific assignment to apply GIS (Geographical Information System) as a tool for spatial analysis.

Heinen (2008) Grenzkontrolle/grenscontrole. 5. Output of the centre At the crossroad of its academic and public functions, SHCL fellows publish articles in national and international refereed journals, professional publications, mostly for a regional audience, and results of commissioned research. This variety is reflected in table 52. The year 2008 was a particularly fruitful year for both refereed and non-refereed academic publications, which had 'ripened' so to say in research in the years before. In 2009 results were disseminated in commissioned and professional publications. Research performed in 2009 and 2010 will result in several publications (books and articles) in 2011.

Earning capacity and academic reputation The SHCL as a whole is structurally financed by Maastricht University and the province of Limburg (each 50 %). We acquire project funding both for archival 147 work and research on a regular basis (c. 30 % of total turnover). The SHCL has seen a growth of commissioned research during the assessment period, mainly on the topic of regional mining history. This can be considered as a sign of growing confidence in the quality of our research by third parties. Table 60, which presents turnover figures, gives an idea of the extent of our work: Table 60: Funding SHCL 2005-2010 in k\u20ac (turnover) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Funding of the institute as a whole 944.8 974.9 965.9 1,007.5 1,095.4 1,044.6 Research grants (2) 66.7 1.8 Contract research (3) 75.0 60.8 10.0 4.5 0 0 We also want to highlight some major acquisitions during the assessment period, which are not reflected to the full extent in the turnover figures above (see Table 61).

History mining area in international perspective. \u20ac 22,000 (2010-2011) 8. Societal relevance: quality, impact and valorisation As an institute for regional history SHCL participates fully in the writing of the history of the province of Limburg. The research of SHCL is disseminated by publications of SHCL itself (especially the SHCL-yearbook Studies voor de sociaal- economische geschiedenis van Limburg ; ca. 800 subscribers); we edit a dissertation series on regional history ( Maaslandse Monografie\u00ebn ); SHCL-fellows publish in journals and books on regional history for a general public (25 in the period 2005-2010); we organised symposia on mining history (2009), population decline in historical perspective (2008), the history of the Maastricht pottery industry (2006). 148 SHCL is also involved in the preparation of the social and economic part of a new scientific history of Limburg to appear with the 150th anniversary of the regional history society LGOG in 2013. SHCL-fellows supervise several so called buitenpromovendi , trainees, and other students in the field of regional history and cultural heritage. 9. Viability With its history of 60 years of collection, preservation and cataloguing of historical material and doing research, SHCL is firmly embedded in the cultural infrastructure of the province of Limburg. The SHCL possesses only a very small structural funding, however. Maastricht University and the Province of Limburg each donate ca. \u20ac 350.000 a year. When compared to the responsibilities of the centre, not only in research, but also in historical documentation, this funding basis is relatively small (SHCL cares for about 4 kms of archival and 3 kms of library material). 10. SWOT analysis Strengths (what are we good at?): x International orientation of the SHCL research programme. x Embeddedness in regional, national and international networks. x Ability to attract third party money. x Build up of knowledge of regional history based on research and documentation. Weaknesses (where are we weak)?: x Small structural funding. x Small research staff. x Private character of SHCL and more or less external position vis \u00e0 vis the University. Opportunities (what chances for improvement?): x Further cooperation or a merger with the Historisch Centrum Limburg; forming into an institute for regional history. Threats: (which developments might threaten us?) x Political basis of funding by the provincial authorities. 149 11. Strategy SHCL considers further cooperation in, a merger with, and developing of the Historisch Centrum Limburg into an institute for regional history in general as an opportunity to become a broader, better equipped, and better facilitated centre of comparative regional history and historical documentation. In this way our responsibilities for the preservation of regional cultural heritage can be continued on a higher level. One of the advantages of this construction would be that the relationship with FASoS can be institutionalised in a so called academiseringsovereenkomst , an agreement to install an academic research atelier in the Historisch Centrum Limburg , in close cooperation FASoS. The Maastricht Virtual Knowledge Studio (M-VKS) The Maastricht Virtual Knowledge Studio (M-VKS) began on 1 September 2007. It is a formal cooperation between Maastricht University and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). It started with 0.4 fte academic staff in late 2007, and grew to 4.4 fte by the end of 2010. The M-VKS is based within the Department of Science and Technology Studies, though members of the M-VKS work with colleagues across the Faculty, the University and other institutions within the region as well as with other KNAW and VKS colleagues in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The M-VKS aims to deepen understanding of the relationship between the material conditions of knowledge production, the nature of knowledge and the changing relationships between producers and users of knowledge. There is particular focus on the ways in which digital technologies mediate knowledge production and relations between social actors, including not only those professionally involved in the social sciences and humanities but also professional and lay social actors in other sectors, including cultural heritage, water management, cartography and healthcare. Critical reflection on the use of digital tools and methods, including websites, simulations and GIS, is a key feature of all M-VKS projects. Key questions that have emerged are how knowledge produced by different social actors is mediated and transformed by digital technologies and what those processes of mediation mean for what counts as knowledge and how it is understood by different social groups. The normative implications for changing distributions of knowledge production and use are important for all research conducted within the M-VKS. The title of the chair established in parallel with the M-VKS, 'digital cultures in development', remains very appropriate. Thus, the M-VKS is a specific instance of the 'science, technology & society' focal point, though there are strong connections both substantively and on a working level with colleagues in other focal points and centres. In addition to conducting research, members of the M-VKS work with colleagues inside and outside of the university in order to support them in their own efforts to understand processes of the digitisation of knowledge production and what they mean for society and for scholars' own practices. The contribution to the development of new social and research practices is reflected in the invitations to provide advice or to act as a sounding board to a variety of organisations at local, national and international levels. For example, members of the group have also 151 been invited to participate in preparing Maastricht's bid to be European Capital of Culture, to create digital maps in Palestine and to provide advice in making a documentary about the role of the internet in the Dutch controversy regarding the vaccination of girls against cervical cancer. Due to external events beyond the control of either the M-VKS group or the Faculty, namely the decision by the KNAW to stop funding the Amsterdam VKS group at the end of 2010, the work of the M-VKS group has been put into question. Since the faculty and the STS programme are convinced about the relevance of the M-VKS work both for society as a whole and for the faculty, the M-VKS group is now integrated into the STS research programme. Administratively and intellectually, the group is already well embedded within the faculty. Beyond the immediate links to STS researchers, members of the M-VKS share an interest in digital technologies with staff in other departments. These will be maintained and developed through joint projects (such as those which already exist around the NWO-funded project on Narrative Fan Practices ) and through common work on the topic of Creative Industries (with the Hogeschool Zuyd and with the Centre for Urban & Euregional Studies which is currently being established at the faculty). The very successful annual workshops organised by the M-VKS on themes around digital technologies which bring together colleagues across the faculty as well as from further afield will be maintained. Through Wyatt's connections with the KNAW, it is to be hoped that future opportunities in digital humanities and e-research can be exploited by the Faculty. 152 IV.3. The Centre for Gender and Diversity (CGD) The Centre for Gender and Diversity was established in 1998 at the University of Maastricht. The establishment of the Centre provided a structural and institutional basis for the development of teaching programmes and research in the field of Gender Studies at the University of Maastricht. Before that, teaching and research in the area of Women's Studies had been scattered over various UM faculties since the end of the 1980s. The establishment of the Centre was a reaction to the suggestion by the Inter-Faculty Women's Studies Council ( Interfacultair Vrouwenstudies Overleg - IVO ) to secure a firmer basis for women's studies in Maastricht by establishing a proper inter-faculty institute. Moreover, by setting up the Centre, Maastricht University managed to acquire a special chair for ' Power and Strategy ' funded by the feminist monthly ' Opzij'. The first Opzij professor, Dr. Maaike Meijer, who had already started in March 1998 was appointed as a full professor and became the Centre's Director as of 1 September 1998. Dr. Mineke Bosch became associate professor. Initially, the Centre was established for a period of five years. By mid 2003 it was recognised as an institute which would in principle be permanent. In the same year, the Opzij Foundation Board decided to continue the Opzij Chair at the Centre. The Centre focuses on gender as a formative social, cultural, economic and symbolic system, and the interaction of gender with other crucial differences such as ethnicity, religion, age and sexuality from an interdisciplinary perspective. By analyzing historical and contemporary interactions of gender and other categories of difference, this programme wishes to gain insight into the dynamics and the continuity as well as the discontinuity of societal transformations, in which both inclusion and exclusion mechanisms and inequality and discrimination are the focal points. Apart from some teaching (the Minor Crucial Differences at FASoS and a series of courses for the University College Maastricht and the Faculty of Economics), the centre's leadership was successful in setting up large third money stream projects on gender equality, financed by the EU. The centre also attracted a postdoc (on ageing studies) and several PhD candidates, and thus grew from 1.6 fte to 7.0 fte in 2008. 153 The Centre for Gender and Diversity was evaluated very positively in 2005.141 Yet the management of this still independent institute was complicated. A continuing flow of incoming temporary projects with which the PhDs candidates had to be financed could not be guaranteed. This and the fact that researchers of the Centre already cooperated in fruitful ways with colleagues at FASoS led the Executive Board of our university and the Faculty Board to the decision to steer the centre towards more integration into the faculty. Since the interdisciplinary humanities profile of the centre and its orientation towards social issues matched so well with the programme of the research group Arts, Media and Culture, CGD fully integrated in that group as of 1 January 2009.142 The AMC research profile was reformulated with the focal point 'Cultural Memory and Diversity' as a productive common denominator. CGD remains a distinct research profile and lives on as a research institute, yet at the same time close cooperation and exchange of expertise on all levels is ensured. Moreover, all CGD PhD candidates are integrated in the FASoS Graduate School. 141 See annex D.2. for the respective documentation. 142 We therefore report the output of the CGD under the AMC sections of the annexes. 154 155 Part V: Annexes As suggested in the SEP, the annexes to this report are presented on a separate webpage in order to keep the size of the self-evaluation report manageable.
