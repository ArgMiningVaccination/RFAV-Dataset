However, despite their importance, relatively little is actually known about regulation of these virulence factors. Here, we show that the pathogenesis-related protein1, SlPR1, from the apoplast outside the plasma membrane to the host nucleus via its nuclear localization signal. Relocation of SlPR1 abolishes generation of the defense signaling peptide, CAPE1, from its C-terminus, and as a consequence, facilitates pathogen invasion of plants. The action of FolSvp1 requires covalent modification by acetylation for full virulence in host tomato tissues. The modification is catalyzed by the Fol FolArd1 lysine acetyltransferase prior to secretion. Addition of an acetyl group to one residue, K167, prevents ubiquitination-dependent degradation of FolSvp1 in both Fol and plant cells with different mechanisms, allowing it to function normally in fungal invasion. Either inactivation of FolSvp1 or removal of the acetyl group on K167 leads to impaired pathogenicity of Fol. These findings indicate that acetylation can regulate the stability of effectors of fungal plant pathogens with impact on virulence. Editor's evaluation The authors provided strong evidence that the Fusarium oxysporum effector protein FolSpv1 enhances virulence by targeting tomato and preventing the generation of the SlPR1-derived phytocytokine CAPE1, which otherwise positively regulates disease resistance in tomato plants. Strikingly, they show that FolSpv1 translocates SlPR1 from the apoplast back into the nucleus of tomato cells, suggesting a previously unknown mechanism employed by pathogenic microbes. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.82628.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.82628.sa0) Introduction In their engagement with pathogens, plants have evolved powerful deterrents to infective organisms, including the well-studied multilayered physical barriers, preformed defenses, and innate immune system ( [Zhang et al., 2020](#bib61); [Zipfel, 2008](#bib64)). Pathogen infection the expression of (PR) genes ( [Kong et al., 2020](#bib27)), and PR1 is one of the most abundantly accumulated plant proteins upon pathogen attack ( [Breen et al., 2017](#bib4)). PR1 is cleaved to produce a conserved defense signaling peptide, CAPE1, in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli to enhance plant immunity through the induction of defense-related genes ( [Breen et al., 2021](#bib54)). PR1 also possesses anti-oomycete et al., 1991](#bib57)). PR1 is therefore an integral component of host defense, and there is strong selection pressure for pathogens to circumvent it during infection ( [Breen et al., 2017](#bib4)). To date, four effectors from different plant pathogens were shown to interact with PR1 proteins, but the functional impacts on virulence are largely unknown ( [Breen et al., 2017](#bib4); [Sung et al., 2021](#bib54)). Increasing evidence suggests that protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important mediators of plant-pathogen 2019](#bib6); [Ren et al., 2017](#bib47)). PTMs range from small chemical modifications (e.g., acetylation) to the addition of complete proteins (e.g., ubiquitination) ( [Ren et al., 2017](#bib47)). Lysine acetylation is a dynamic and reversible PTM, which is regulated by balanced activities of acetyltransferases and deacetylases, respectively ( [Narita et al., 2019](#bib44)). This PTM is frequently identified on histones and occurs widely in non-histone proteins ( [Carabetta et al., 2019](#bib6); [Ren et al., 2017](#bib47)). Acetylation affects protein functions through diverse mechanisms, including by regulating protein stability, subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, and cross-talk with other PTM events [Narita et al., 2019](#bib44)). The bacterial effector protein PopP2 was found to be autoacetylated, and removal of this modification abolishes virulence of and et al., 2010](#bib55)). Although the acetylomes of several pathogenic plant fungi, al., 2016](#bib63)), have been determined by mass spectrometry analysis, the function of these modification in virulence remains poorly characterized. F. oxysporum is a root-infecting fungal pathogen causing wilt disease of a wide variety of plants ( [Michielse and Rep, 2009](#bib42)). F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici the causal agent of Fusarium wilt limited to tomato, invades the roots and subsequently colonizes the xylem vessels, thereby compromising water transport resulting in wilting ( [Michielse and Rep, 2009](#bib42)). During colonization of the host xylem vessels, Fol secretes small effectors including 14 different ''Secreted-in-Xylem'' proteins, and some of them play critical roles in determining host specificity and plant immunity ( [Gawehns et al., 2015](#bib19); [Houterman et al., 2009](#bib36); [Ma et al., 2013](#bib40)). In previous studies from our laboratory, we identified 32 acetylated effector candidates secreted at the early infection stage by mass spectrometry ( [Li et al., 2020a](#bib34)). However, the function of these candidate effectors in fungal virulence is unknown. In this study, we show that one such effector, Fol-Secreted Virulence-related Protein1 (FolSvp1), acetyltransferase prior stabilizes FolSvp1 in Fol by repressing ubiquitination-dependent degradation of this protein, allowing for its accumulation and secretion. Secreted FolSvp1 directly interacts with and relocates tomato SlPR1 from the apoplast to host nucleus by way of its nuclear localization signal. This translocation of SlPR1 abolishes generation of the CAPE1 peptide, and a result, the pathogen invades tomato successfully. K167 acetylation also avoids ubiquitination on this residue in planta, preventing degradation of FolSvp1 by the 26S proteasome before entering plant nucleus. These findings provide a clear example in which acetylation both activates and protects an effector, directly facilitating the successful outcome of a fungal plant pathogen invasion. Results FolSvp1 is a secretory protein on K167 Our ( [Li et al., 2020a](#bib34)). Prediction with SignalP5.0 revealed the presence of a potential signal peptide (SP) on the N-terminus of FolSvp1 (aa 1-19). We therefore performed a yeast signal trap assay to validate the secretory function of the SP ( [Yin et al., 2018](#bib59)). As shown in [Figure 1A](#fig1), the YTK12 strain carrying pSUC2-FolSvp11-19 was able to grow on YPRAA medium with raffinose as the sole carbon source and reduce the triphenyltetrazolium chloride to the red-colored insoluble triphenylformazan, indicating that the of FolSvp1 is functional. [see all](/articles/82628/figures#fig1) To confirm secretion of this protein, a recombinant FolSvp1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion with or without the SP was expressed in Fol using the RP27 constitutive promoter, with GFP serving as control 1\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/82628/figures#fig1s1)). Although both FolSvp1-GFP and GFP were expressed in the mycelium, only FolSvp1-GFP with the SP was detected in the culture supernatant induced by tomato roots ( [Figure 1B](#fig1)), indicating that FolSvp1 could be secreted by Fol depending on its SP. To further investigate the secretory property of FolSvp1, total proteins were extracted from mycelia and culture supernatant in the presence or absence of tomato roots. As shown in [Figure 1C](#fig1), the accumulation and secretion of FolSvp1-GFP was much reduced in the absence of roots. These observations, together with our previous finding that tomato root treatment increases FolSvp1 transcription ( [Li et al., 2020a](#bib34)), indicate that the presence of tomato roots is critical for the accumulation and secretion of FolSvp1. Compared with the even distribution of GFP protein in the cells, fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that FolSvp1-GFP was enriched at the apical area of hyphae or ( [Figure infected with FolSvp1-GFP overexpression strains, GFP signals were observed in the nucleus of root cells at the inoculation sites ( [Figure 1E](#fig1)). Based on these results, we conclude that secreted FolSvp1 is delivered into plant cells with the nucleus being the accumulation site. To confirm acetylation of FolSvp1, FolSvp1-GFP was pulled down with anti-GFP agarose beads. Using specific antibody directed against acetylated K167 of FolSvp1 (anti-K167ac), we examined the modification status of FolSvp1 in mycelia. The Western blot analyses detected signals only with the wild-type (WT) FolSvp1 but not with the glutamine (Q) and (R) substitution mutants at position 167 ( [Figure 1F](#fig1)), which mimic the acetylated and unacetylated forms of lysine, respectively, with respect to residue charge ( [Carabetta et al., 2019](#bib6)), indicating that K167 is indeed to secretion. K167 acetylation is required for FolSvp1 and full virulence of Fol Although FolSvp1 in different ( [Li et al., 2020a](#bib34)), phylogenetic analysis showed that it was closely related to members of the Fusarium genus ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/82628/figures#fig2s1)). Prediction of sequence patterns with the MEME (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation) tool identified three putative motifs of FolSvp1 and K167 was localized in motif 1 ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B](/articles/82628/figures#fig2s1)). Further alignment of motif 1 showed that the amino acid at 167 site was highly conserved with K or Q residue ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C and D](/articles/82628/figures#fig2s1)) in FolSvp1 homologs, only two R variations were found in fungi F. findings suggest that K167 acetylation might be conserved, and associated with pathogenicity of these fungi. To explore the effect of acetylation on FolSvp1, we expressed mutated versions K167 to Q or R with C-terminal GFP fusions under the control of the RP27 promoter ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/82628/figures#fig1s1)). Although no obvious difference was observed in conidia among different transformants, compared with the WT FolSvp1 and the Q mutant, the R mutant displayed weaker fluorescence ( [Figure As a consequence, secretion of mutant FolSvp1 was dramatically decreased ( [Figure 2B](#fig2)), and no FolSvp1R protein was detected in the nucleus of root cells infected with this strain ( [Figure 2C and Note that K167 ( These support a critical role of K167 acetylation in FolSvp1 accumulation and secretion, and indicate a function in planta. [see all](/articles/82628/figures#fig2) To determine the virulence contribution of FolSvp1, we generated FolSvp1 knockout (FolSvp1) and C](/articles/82628/figures#fig1s1)). vegetative 1E](/articles/82628/figures#fig1s1)), virulence of the on and phenotype of the FolSvp1 mutants, indicating that FolSvp1 is essential for the full virulence of Fol. Since K167 acetylation is required for FolSvp1 secretion, it is likely that this modification is physiologically important for Fol infection. Indeed, substitution of arginine (R) for K167 (FolSvp1-CR) impaired virulence of Fol, while mutation of this residue to glutamine (Q) (FolSvp1-CQ) had little effect on its infectivity ( [Figure 2E and F](#fig2)). Overall, these data indicate that K167 acetylation of FolSvp1 is likely a key evolutionary step in preparing FolSvp1 to contribute to the virulence of Fol. K167 acetylation prevents ubiquitination-dependent degradation of FolSvp1 in Fol One possible explanation for the decreased accumulation and secretion of the mutant FolSvp1R is that K167 deacetylation leads to instability of this protein. To examine this possibility, conidia of FolSvp1R-GFP overexpression strain was cultured for 14 hr and then treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for another 2 hr. With the addition of MG132, FolSvp1R-GFP was elevated 4-fold and its putatively ubiquitinated form now be detected ( [Figure 3A](#fig3)). In contrast, MG132 treatment had little effect on FolSvp1-GFP and FolSvp1Q-GFP, indicating that the WT protein was largely acetylated in the presence of tomato root. Western blot analyses using the ubiquitin antibody confirmed FolSvp1R, but in [see all](/articles/82628/figures#fig3) To confirm and extend these observations, FolSvp1R-GFP pulled down with anti-GFP agarose beads was analyzed by mass spectrometry following digestion trypsin. In total, three ubiquitinated effect of ubiquitination on FolSvp1 degradation, we changed each of these three lysine residues, or all of them to R to eliminate ubiquitination of these sites in FolSvp1R-GFP. As shown in [Figure 3D](#fig3), mutation of any of the three K to R markedly increased the amount of FolSvp1, while their simultaneous alteration elevated FolSvp1R-GFP to the identical level of FolSvp1-GFP ( [Figure 3D and E](#fig3)). As a consequence, secretion mutant FolSvp1 (FolSvp14R-GFP) was much increased ( [Figure 3E](#fig3)), and this protein could now be observed in the nucleus of infected root cells ( [Figure 3F](#fig3)). In contrast to the impaired virulence of FolSvp1-CR, complementation with FolSvp14R completely restored the virulence FolSvp1 mutants ( [Figure 3G and H](#fig3)), further confirming the importance of FolSvp1 stability in Fol virulence. These results indicate first, that ubiquitination of K152, K258, and K284 leads to degradation of FolSvp1 by the 26S proteasome and second, that acetylation of K167 prevents ubiquitination-mediated FolSvp1 degradation, resulting in in the relation between acetylation of K167 and FolSvp1 stability in more detail, it was of interest to identify the enzyme responsible for acetylation of this protein. For this purpose, we utilized the FolSvp1-GFP and the GFP transformants and performed immunoprecipitation file 1a and we initially focused on FolArd1 [Lim et al., 2006](#bib37)), which enriched in the FolSvp1-GFP sample. FolSvp1-GFP and FolArd1-Flag fusion constructs were co-introduced into F. oxysporum protoplasts, and positive transformants were selected. FolArd1 was detected in the proteins that eluted from anti-GFP beads using the anti-Flag FolArd1 interacts with FolSvp1. To that FolArd1 plays a role in acetylation of FolSvp1 in vivo, we first tried to inactivate this enzyme. However, no deletion mutants were obtained after numerous attempts, suggesting that FolArd1 is likely an essential protein in Fol. Accordingly, we determined the effect of elevated FolArd1 on FolSvp1. Overexpression of FolArd1 markedly increased acetylation of WT FolSvp1 in the absence of tomato roots, but had no obvious effect on the Q and R mutants ( [Figure 4B](#fig4)), indicating that FolArd1 is Concomitantly, the accumulation by ~4-fold ( [Figure acetylation efficiently prevents ubiquitinated species. Moreover, purified FolArd1 acetylated WT FolSvp1 in vitro, whereas it displayed no activity against either the K167Q or the K167R mutant FolSvp1 proteins ( [Figure 4F](#fig4)). These data demonstrate FolArd1 is responsible for acetylation of K167 in FolSvp1, and they also show that acetylation directly regulates the accumulation of FolSvp1 in fungal cells and its secretion. Acetylation stabilizes FolSvp1 in planta FolSvp1 contains an SP that facilitates its fungal cells tomato roots, FolSvp1 was localized in the nuclear but not the apoplastic regions of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves in either the absence or presence of the SP ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)), indicating that the native SP secretion in planta ( Prediction cNLS Mapper revealed two potential importin -dependent nuclear localization determine how FolSvp1 is translocated into the nucleus, we replaced the core hydrophilic residues K, R, and Q with the hydrophobic residue isoleucine ( [Kosugi et al., shown in [Figure 5B](#fig5), NLS1 mutation led to impaired localization of FolSvp1, while NLS2 mutation had no obvious effect on its nuclear distribution. Consequently, mutation of NLS1 (FolSvp1-Cnls1) but not NLS2 (FolSvp1-Cnls2) led Fol ( [Figure 5C and D](#fig5)). These results suggest that dominates the nuclear translocation of FolSvp1 required for pathogenicity of this fungus. [see all](/articles/82628/figures#fig5) The SP of PR1 is highly effective in targeting proteins/peptides to the apoplast via the ER/Golgi secretory et al., 2011](#bib26)). To manipulate FolSvp1 secretion in tobacco, we replaced its native SP with that of tomato SlPR1 and found that FolSvp1 localization was dramatically changed, with clear observation of the protein in the apoplast ( [Figure 5A and E](#fig5)). To explore the function of K167 acetylation in planta, we replaced it with Q or R, and found this modification has no effect on the distribution of FolSvp1 with or without SPs ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)). Interestingly, although there is little difference among different forms of nuclear FolSvp1 ( [Figure 5F-I](#fig5)), the amount of the Q and R mutants was ~3-fold higher than the WT cytoplasm ( [Figure 5H and I](#fig5)). As the amount of the Q and R mutants are almost equal, we speculate that K167 itself is a target of the plant cytoplasmic ubiquitination system. Not unexpected, mass spectrometry analysis of FolSvp1 ( 3\u2014figure supplement 1D](/articles/82628/figures#fig3s1)). MG132 treatment led to increased amount and detection of the ubiquitinated form with only the WT FolSvp1, but not the Q and R mutants and ubiquitination-dependent degradation of FolSvp1 before entering the host nucleus. Collectively, these data indicate that K167 acetylation is required for FolSvp1 stability but not its translocation into host nucleus in planta. FolSvp1 targets tomato SlPR1 To gain further insight into the function of FolSvp1 in the host, we used FolSvp1 without the SP (SPFolSvp1) as a bait to screen the tomato cDNA library via GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) FolSvp1-interacting protein candidates ( [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/82628/figures#fig6s1)). Among them, two genes were identified as frameshift, nine genes were not full length, and one mitochondrial outer membrane protein (SlMit) had self-activation activity ( tomato; Genbank accession number P04284) was selected for further research. qRT-PCR analysis detected the transcript accumulation of SlPR1 in multiple tissues including cotyledon, root, leaves, flowers, green fruit, and red fruit ( [Figure 6A](#fig6)). In addition, the expression of SlPR1 in the root was up-regulated after Fol infection, reaching a peak at 3 days after inoculation (DAI) ( [Figure 6B](#fig6)). These results suggest a role of SlPR1 in tomato immunity and thus a likely target to be attacked by Fol. [see all](/articles/82628/figures#fig6) To verify the interaction between FolSvp1 and SlPR1, an Y2H assay was performed for the mature form of the proteins without the SP element ( [Breen et al., 2016](#bib3); [Sung et in [Figure 6C](#fig6), SPFolSvp1 and SPSlPR1 indeed associate. To determine whether FolSvp1 is able to interact with SlPR1 localized to the apoplast, its original SP was replaced with the SP of SlPR1 and an in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementarity (BiFC) assay was carried of yellow fluorescence indicated that FolSvp1 secreted by the fungus can associate with SlPR1 in the extracellular space ( [Figure 6D](#fig6)). In either the in vitro or the in vivo experiments, change of K167 to Q or R has little effect on the interaction of FolSvp1 with SlPR1 ( [Figure 6C and D](#fig6)). contains 12 genes that may encode PR1 proteins. Among them, 10 genes were up-regulated after Fol infection ( [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A](/articles/82628/figures#fig6s2)) and were then tested for the interaction with FolSvp1. Both Y2H and BiFC analyses indicated that FolSvp1 only associates with (PR1b1) ( [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B, C](/articles/82628/figures#fig6s2)). Based on these data, we propose that FolSvp1 specifically targets SlPR1 in planta independent of its acetylation. SlPR1 contributes to tomato resistance SlPR1 is a 159-amino acid protein with a SP the N-terminus (aa 1-24) ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A](/articles/82628/figures#fig5s1)), a for secretion. To determine its subcellular localization, SlPR1 with or without the SP (SPSlPR1) was fused to RFP and transiently expressed 1B](/articles/82628/figures#fig5s1)). After plasmolysis, SlPR1 to be located to the apoplast while SPSlPR1 was distributed in the cytoplasm ( [Figure supplement 1C](/articles/82628/figures#fig5s1)). These results confirmed the secretion of SlPR1 dependent on the N-terminal SP, which was accordingly used for manipulating localization of FolSvp1 in plant cells ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)). To determine the role of SlPR1 in tomato resistance to Fol infection, we tried to delete SlPR1 by CRISPR-cas9. However, after numerous efforts we could not obtain the desired knockout mutants, suggesting that such mutations of SlPR1 in tomato are lethal. Alternatively, we generated SlPR1 6E](#fig6)) WT plants, the SlPR1 showed al., 2015](#bib10)), the CAPE1-GFP band with the molecular weight of 29.8 kDa was observed after Fol infection ( [Figure 6E](#fig6)). Mass spectrometry analysis of the band revealed the presence of only the CAPE1 region but not other parts of SlPR1, further confirming it to be CAPE1-GFP. In contrast, no such band was observed in seedlings overexpressing SlPR1 6F and G](#fig6)). To further confirm this peptide contributes to plant resistance, tomato seedlings treated with or without synthetic CAPE1 were inoculated with Fol. As shown in I](#fig6), pretreatment with CAPE1 effectively suppressed Fol invasion. These results indicate that SlPR1 is a critical part of tomato immunity against Fol through generation of the CAPE1 peptide. FolSvp1 relocates SlPR1 to host nucleus to is an apoplast-localized protein ( [Figure 5\u2014figure 1](/articles/82628/figures#fig5s1)), but BiFC analyses with FolSvp1 in the nucleus ( [Figure 6D](#fig6)). One possible explanation is that FolSvp1 can change the subcellular localization of SlPR1 by direct interaction. To determine this possibility, we incubated tomato root protoplasts with purified MBP-SlPR1 and found that the addition of FolSvp1-GFP led to detection of MBP-SlPR1 in the nucleus ( [Figure 7A](#fig7)). In contrast, not carry it into the nucleus ( [Figure 7A](#fig7)), further confirming the specificity of FolSvp1 on SlPR1. Although the acetylation status of K167 has no effect on the function of FolSvp1, mutation of NLS1 (FolSvp1nls1-GFP) abolished the relocation of SlPR1 to the nucleus ( [Figure 7B](#fig7)). Moreover, SlPR1 was observed in the nucleus of SlPR1 overexpression plants infected by WT but not the FolSvp1 and the FolSvp1-Cnls1 mutant strains ( [Figure 7C](#fig7)). The observations that FolSvp1 associates with the N-terminal part of SlPR1 but not the CAPE1 region ( [Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/82628/figures#fig7s1)) and that no detection of the nucleus of Fol-infected root cells relocates SlPR1 released CAPE1 during plant immunity. Collectively, suggest that FolSvp1 hijacks apoplastic SlPR1 and translocates it into the host nucleus dependent on the NLS1 motif. [see all](/articles/82628/figures#fig7) To determine the effect of SlPR1 relocation, we replaced its native SP with an NLS and overexpressed the protein in tomato. As shown in [Figure 7D and E](#fig7), substitution NLS for SP led to the localization of SlPR1 to the nucleus. Therefore, NLS-SPSlPR1-GFP can be used to mimic FolSvp1-mediated SlPR1 nuclear relocation. In contrast to SlPR1, no CAPE1 was produced in NLS-SPSlPR1-GFP overexpression plants after Fol invasion ( [Figure resistance was observed ( [Figure 7G and H](#fig7)). To further confirm the relation FolSvp1 triggered SlPR1 translocation and CAPE1 generation, we with the WT and FolSvp1 overexpression strains. Compared with the WT strain, much less CAPE1 was produced after inoculation with the FolSvp1 overexpression strain ( [Figure 7I](#fig7)), and as a severe phenotype was observed ( [Figure 7J and K](#fig7)). These results indicate that relocation of SlPR1 into the host nucleus by FolSvp1 eliminates CAPE1 generation and abolishes its contribution to plant resistance. Based on the above data, we propose a model to explain how FolSvp1 manipulates plant immunity ( [Figure 8](#fig8)). In response to Fol infection, tomato up-regulates the expression level and secretion of the PR protein SlPR1 to the apoplast to enhance resistance through generation of the CAPE1 peptide. However, Fol produces the effector FolSvp1 to counter SlPR1-dependent defense FolSvp1 directly interacts with and hijacks the secreted SlPR1, relocating it into the host nucleus, thereby eliminating CAPE1 production and enabling Fol to invade tomato successfully. Critically, K167 acetylation of FolSvp1 by FoArd1 acts as a protective shield to prevent ubiquitination-dependent degradation of FolSvp1 in both Fol and plant cells, allowing it to function properly in Fol invasion. Discussion Although effectors are critical virulence factors of plant pathogens, relatively little is known about how these proteins might be regulated. The studies described here provide evidence that lysine acetylation can regulate the stability of an important fungal effector that specifically interacts with and inactivates a key host defense response protein, thereby enabling virulence of the pathogen. Specifically, we found that (i) FolSvp1, a previously uncharacterized effector, is required for the full virulence of Fol; (ii) tomato SlPR1 is capable of producing the bioactive peptide CAPE1 after Fol invasion and represents a crucial contributor to host defense response; (iii) the secreted FolSvp1 eliminates CAPE1 generation through hijacking the tomato apoplastic protein SlPR1 to host nucleus to promote fungal invasion; (iv) addition of an acetyl group on K167 by FolArd1 stabilizes FolSvp1 in both Fol and plant cells; and (v) acetylation of FolSvp1 directly regulates Fol virulence. As such, these findings greatly expand our understanding of effector regulation and open up new possibilities for investigation in the field of microbe-plant interactions. This complex regulatory system serves as a detailed example of how pathogens manipulate host immunity through regulation of an effector. The cross-talk between acetylation and ubiquitination, which both happen at lysine residues, is a critical regulatory mechanism controlling vital cellular functions ( [Caron et al., 2005](#bib7)). The ubiquitination/26S proteasome mechanism is indispensable for the turnover of unuseful and foreign invading toxic proteins ( [Yin, 2021](#bib60)). As FolSvp1 targets SlPR1 to promote Fol invasion, it is not surprising that plants might evolve a defense by triggering degradation of FolSvp1 by ubiquitination. As a counteraction, acetylation of K167 would have evolved to prevent the degradation of FolSvp1 in plants. The detection of K167 ubiquitination and the identical behavior of the Q and R mutants in plant cells indicates a direct competition between acetylation and ubiquitination. Upon sensing of tomato roots by Fol, K167 is acetylated to stabilize FolSvp1, which would otherwise be turned over. The observations of ubiquitination of K152, K258, and K284, but not K167, together with the completely opposite behavior of the K167Q and K167R mutants, point to an indirect mechanism between these two modification types. Therefore, acetylation of a single lysine residue, K167, facilitates FolSvp1 secretion and subsequently its virulence in planta with different mechanisms. Notably, K167 and its acetylated form, Q, are widely distributed in FolSvp1 homologs in a variety of plant pathogens, strongly suggesting that this modification is a conserved phenomenon determining proteins' stability during pathogen-plant interactions. The mechanism of acetylation-dependent stabilization of FolSvp1 in Fol is a topic to be explored in more detail in future studies, but it is clear that these results serve as a salient sample of how lysine acetylation regulates a protein's stability by cross-talk with ubiquitination. PR1 is generally considered to be associated with defense against biotrophs or hemi-biotrophs ( [Glazebrook, 2005](#bib20)), however, its role in plant defense Fol, one of the facultative parasitic fungi ( [Divon et al., 2005](#bib14)), is poorly characterized. The data described here provide evidence that SlPR1 contributes to host resistance to Fol through generating the defense signaling CAPE1 peptide. Now, it is known that the CAPE1 peptide broad activity against Parastagonospora [Sung et al., 2021](#bib54)). Moreover, PR1 proteins are also able to inhibit the growth of oomycetes ( [Choudhary and 1995](#bib45); [Woloshuk et al., 1991](#bib57)). Given its importance in plant defense responses, plant pathogens must eliminate the effect of PR1 to ensure invasion via multiple strategies. In fact, PR1 is targeted by diverse pathogen-secreted effectors, including CSEPP0055, ToxA, SsCP1 with et al., 2017](#bib4)), and P. nodorum Tox3 was recently reported to prevent CAPE1 release from wheat PR1 in vitro ( [Sung et al., 2021](#bib54)). We show that FolSvp1 physically interacts with tomato SlPR1 and translocates it from the apoplast to the host nucleus to block CAPE1 production, a phenomenon not previously reported in other pathogens. All these findings indicate that plant pathogens employ a variety of approaches to eliminate the function of PR1 proteins. The observations of FolSvp1 and SlPR1 interaction in both the apoplast and the nucleus of N. benthamiana leaves suggest that binding of FolSvp1 to SlPR1 may inhibit its anti-fungal activity and/or the cleavage of SlPR1 to produce CAPE1 in the extracellular region or even the cytoplasm. In addition, the BiFC assays performed with N. benthamiana leaves might not completely mimic the physiological conditions. Therefore, whether FolSpv1-mediated translocation of SlPR1 into the nucleus impedes CAPE1 release is the only way of PR1 inactivation needs to be further strengthened with additional data including BiFC analyses using the FolSvp1 overexpression Fol strain and the SlPR1 overexpression tomato in future studies. These studies also provide a clear example in which acetylation affects the stability of an effector in plant pathogens. Acetylation has been shown to affect many proteins and processes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, but to date, only a few instances of a specific effect on a virulence factor have been uncovered. The discovery here that acetylation of one specific lysine residue in FolSvp1 increases the stability of this protein in Fol and in planta, promoting invasion of tomato, provides a clear example of a direct effect of acetylation on a biological process in plant pathogens. With the recent discovery that a large number of putative effectors are acetylated in al., 2020b](#bib35), [Ren et al., 2017](#bib47)), it is likely that the findings reported here are only the beginning of what will be a widespread phenomenon in plant pathogens. Materials and methods Fungal strains, plants, and culture conditions [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-1) oxysporum f. 2013](#bib40); [Ma et al., 2010](#bib39)) was used in all experiments. The fungus was cultured on potato dextrose agar plates at 25\u00b0C to generate conidia. The harvested at the optimum concentration of 5\u00d7106 conidia/ml ( [Vitale al., 2019](#bib56)) production ( [Li et al., 2020a](#bib34)). Cultures were grown at 25\u00b0C with shaking at 200 rpm to harvest mycelia for protein extraction. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Alisa Craig [AC]) plants were grown in tissue culture bottles with 1/2 MS medium for root collection. Tomato and tobacco (N. benthamiana) seedlings were potted in a soil mix (vermiculite:humus = 1:2) and placed in a climatized greenhouse at 28\u00b0C with 65% relative humidity and a 16 hr photoperiod ( [Cao et al., 2018](#bib5)). Constructs for gene and overexpression in Fol [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-2) To generate a FolSvp1 gene deletion mutant, two 0.7 kb fragments flanking the target gene were PCR-amplified with the primer pairs FolSvp1-up-F/R and FolSvp1-down-F/R. Thereafter, the two flanking sequences were linked with the hygromycin resistance cassette HPH by overlap PCR using the primer pair Hph-F/R. The 2.8 kb fragment was amplified using primer pairs FolSvp1-k-F/R and purified for protoplast transformation. For complementation, a genomic region encompassing the entire FolSvp1 coding sequence (948 bp) and its native promoter (upstream 1.5 kb) sequence was amplified using the primers FolSvp1-C-F/R and inserted into the Xho I-digested pYF11 (G418 resistance) vector using the Kit (Vazyme). For site-directed mutagenesis the K152, K167, K258, or K284 residue were generated with the primers listed in [Supplementary file 1c](/articles/82628/figures#supp1). Constructs with the native gene promoter were transformed into FolSvp1-KO7 protoplast. To overexpress FolSvp1-GFP and its point amplified FolSvp1 using the primers FolSvp1-OE-F and FolSvp1-C-R and inserted into the pYF11 vector carrying the strong RP27 promoter. To overexpress FolArd1-Flag in Fol, the FolArd1 gene was amplified using primers FolArd1-Flag-F/R and inserted into the Xho I-digested pHZ126 vector (hygromycin resistance) carrying C-terminal Flag tag under the RP27 promoter. Then, the constructs were used for the protoplast transformation of WT Fol or FolSVP1-GFP overexpression strains. The transformants were confirmed by PCR, Western blotting, or microscopic observation of the fluorescent signal using an Olympus BX53 fluorescence microscope (Melville, NY, USA) to observe GFP and DAPI (D9542, Sigma), a widely used fluorescent label for the nucleus. All the primers used in this study were listed in [Supplementary file 1c](/articles/82628/figures#supp1). Functional verification of FolSvp1 SP [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-3) The predicted N-terminal 19-amino acid SP sequences of FolSvp1 were fused in frame to the invertase gene in the pSUC2 vector by two complementary primer sequences ( [Supplementary file 1c](/articles/82628/figures#supp1)). EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes were used to insert the SP sequences into the pSUC2 vector ( [Yin et al., 2018](#bib59)). The recombinant plasmids were then transformed into invertase secretion deficient yeast strain YTK12 by lithium acetate-mediated transformation. The function of the SP can be evaluated by using different selective media and color reaction to verify the secretion of invertase as described previously ( [Yin et al., 2018](#bib59)). Construction of binary vectors for agroinfiltration [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-4) For the subcellular localization of FolSvp1 in planta, the entire FolSvp1 gene containing the sequence encoding the native SP was PCR-amplified using primer pairs FolSvp1-pQB-F/R. The forward primer SPFolSvp1-pQB-F was used to generate truncated FolSvp1 lacking the sequence encoding the SP (SPFolSvp1-GFP). The forward primer SP+PR1SPFolSvp1-pQB-F generated an artificial form of FolSvp1 (SP+PR1SPFolSvp1-GFP) containing the tomato SlPR1 SP (1-24 amino acids) instead of its endogenous SP (1-19 amino acids). FolSvp1-GFP point mutation variants and the nls1 and nls2 variants with changes in the two predicted nuclear localization motifs (NLS1 and NLS2) were generated by site-specific mutagenesis with the primers listed in [Supplementary file 1c](/articles/82628/figures#supp1). All of the constructed plasmids were cloned into vector pQB-V3 ( [Chen et al., 2020](#bib9)). These constructs were transferred to the destination vector pK7FWG2 ( [Karimi et al., SlPR1 PCR-amplified with the primer pairs SlPR1-pQB-F/R. An SlPR1 construct lacking the sequence encoding the SP (SPSlPR1) was obtained by PCR using primers SPSlPR1-pQB-F and SlPR1-pQB-R. ( ( et al., 2015](#bib16)). For the SlChi3 constructions, the SlChi3 was amplified with the primer pairs SlChi3-pQB-F/R. The PCR products were cloned into pQB-V3 and then recombined into the RFP-tagged pGWB554 et al., or the pK7FWG2 vector. To generate the BiFC system, the pQB-V3 constructs were recombined into the pEarleyGate201-YN and pEarleyGate202-YC PR1 homologs and truncated PR1 constructions, these genes were colony to pQB-V3 vector from their pGADT7 constructions, and then recombined into the pEarleyGate202-YC vectors with the primers in [Supplementary file 1c](/articles/82628/figures#supp1). To test whether SlPR1 contribute to tomato resistance, we tried to induce SlPR1 mutation by CRISPR-cas9 system as described previously ( [Deng et al., 2018](#bib12)). Target sites for the SlPR1 gene were designed based on the online tool CRISPR-P 2.0 ( [http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/crispr/](http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/crispr/)). Two single-guide RNAs were designed into ( et al., pair ( [Supplementary file 1c](/articles/82628/figures#supp1)). All binary constructs were then transformed into Agrobacterium LBA4404. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of N. detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-5) The Agrobacterium transformants were used for the transient transformation of N. benthamiana as described previously ( [Li et al., 2018b](#bib33)). A strain containing the silencing suppressor P19 was co-infiltrated at an OD600 of 0.3. For BiFC assays, Agrobacterium strains harboring either the FolSvp1-nYFP or SlPR1-cYFP construct were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and co-transformed into N. benthamiana using a transient expression assay as described above. After inoculation, the leaves were incubated at 25\u00b0C in the greenhouse for 40-72 hr depending on the purpose. N. benthamiana transgenic plants expressing RFP:H2B were used to label plant nuclei ( [Martin et al., 2009](#bib41)). For plasmolysis, leaf tissues were cut and incubated for 6 hr with 800 mM mannitol and then imaged. To observe fluorescence, the infiltrated tobacco leaves were imaged under a fluorescence microscope as above. To generate SlPR1-overexpressing transgenic tomato, the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of tomato was performed following a previously described method ( [Du et al., 2020](#bib17)). Transformants were selected on medium 50 mg/l kanamycin. Putative transformants were confirmed by PCR and Western blotting. Similar method was used to generate transgenic tomato lines carrying SlPR1 variants. Protein extraction [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-6) The Fol-infected tissues or plants were frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen and then homogenized in protein extraction buffer as described previously ( [Xian et al., 2020](#bib58)). The culture supernatant protein was extracted as described previously ( [Li et al., 2020a](#bib34)). To determine that FolSvp1 could translocate to host roots, tomato roots were inoculated a spore suspension (5\u00d7106 spores/ml) of the FolSvp1-GFP-overexpressing transformants for 24 hr, and subsequently used for protoplast collection and protein extraction as described previously ( [Ji et al., 2021](#bib23)). Plant cytoplasm or nuclear proteins were extracted from agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana leaves using a Nuclear Extraction Kit (Solarbio) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Solarbio) 3 days after infiltration following the manufacturer's instructions. Apoplastic fluid from agroinfiltrated leaves was isolated as described previously ( [Dong et al., 2014](#bib15); [Shabab et al., 2008](#bib51)). Western blotting [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-7) The obtained proteins were separated by peptide (KNDHDEDK(ac)ECVCFN) conjugated to KLH as an antigen. Antibodies were produced from rabbits by HUABIO (Hangzhou, China). The specificity of the antibody was tested by immunoblot analysis (1:10,000 dilution). The signals in the blots were visualized with ECL kits (Millipore) and photographed using an Amersham Imager 680 (GE Healthcare). SDS-PAGE was performed with silver staining or Coomassie brilliant blue staining to verify equal loading. IP and mass spectrometry [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-8) IP assays for LC-MS/MS analysis were performed as previously described ( [Zhang et al., 2021](#bib62)) with several modifications. FolSvp1-GFP overexpression Fol tissues (0.5 g) or SlPR1-GFP overexpression plant tissues (1 g) were collected for protein extraction as described above. GFP-Trap agarose beads (50 l, KTSM1301, KT-HEALTH, China) were added to the clean protein extracts, which were then incubated for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C with end-to-end slow, constant rotation. GFP-Trap beads were washed three times with 1 ml of cold wash buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, Triton X-100) and two additional times with wash buffer without Triton X-100 detergent. The washed beads were boiled with 50 \u00b5l SDT (4% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.6), and the pulled down protein was subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, or LC-MS/MS. Co-IP assay [Request a detailed collected from Fol co-expressing FolSvp1-GFP and FolArd1-Flag strains. Tissue powder samples (300 mg each) were suspended in 1 ml of cold extraction buffer for protein extraction as described above. GFP-tagged FolSvp1 fusions were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP agarose captured proteins were eluted from the beads as described above. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Y2H analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-10) To generate the Y2H system, the coding sequence of FolSvp1 (without the SP, SPFolSvp1) was cloned to the bait vector pGBKT7, which was then transformed into the Y2H Gold strain. A tomato Mate & Plate library was constructed and used for screening with the Matchmaker Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid System (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For further verification of FolSvp1 candidate targets, the coding sequences of SlPR1 or SlMit were cloned into the prey vector pGADT7. Proper combinations of two of these plasmids were co-transformed into the Y2H Gold strain. The positive clones were collected and assayed for growth on DDO (SD/-Leu/-Trp) and QDO/A (SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp with 125 ng/ml AbA) plates. Q or R variants at the K167 residue (SPFolSvp1Q and SPFolSvp1Q) were introduced into pGBKT7, and Y2H assays were performed as described above. The coding sequences of 10 up-regulated tomato PR-1 proteins and truncated SlPR1 proteins were synthesized and introduced in pGADT7 by Tsingke Biotech, China. The full gene sequences were shown in [Supplementary file 1d](/articles/82628/figures#supp1). All the constructs in Y2H assay removed its N-terminal predicted secretory SP according to SignalP sever. Heterologous expression purification [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-11) SlPR1 and SlChi3 sequences lacking the N-terminal SP were cloned into the pExp-his-xMBP-TEV expression vector via the overhangs added by the primers during amplification ( [Supplementary file 1c](/articles/82628/figures#supp1)). The His-MBP-SlPR1/SlChi3 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified as described previously ( [Gamir et al., 2016](#bib18)) with appropriate modifications. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 1 proteins were purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Bound proteins were eluted with a solution of 300 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and the eluted fraction was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8. Protein concentrations were determined with an Omni-Easy Instant BCA Protein Assay Kit (Epizyme) and subsequently visualized by Coomassie-stained before being concentrated using a 10 kDa MWCO Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Merck Millipore) to appropriate concentrations for further analysis. FolArd1 sequence was amplified using the primers FolArd1-His-F/R ( [Supplementary file 1c](/articles/82628/figures#supp1)). This fragment was then cloned into a BamH I-digested pET-28a expression vector via the overhangs added by the primers during amplification. The FolArd1-His protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified as described above for the acetylation modification essay. In vitro acetylation assay [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-12) The in vitro acetylation essay was modified from a published method ( [Song et al., 2016](#bib52)). Briefly, the purified 5 g FolArd1-His and 10 g WT and K167 mutant FolSvp1-GFP proteins purified using anti-GFP agarose beads were incubated in the buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium butyrate) with 0.2 mM acetyl-CoA at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Then the reaction products were analyzed by Western blot. In vitro protein uptake assay [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-13) The protein uptake assay was performed using a published method ( [Kale et al., 2010](#bib24)) with small alterations. In brief, tomato roots were used for protoplast collection as described above. Fifty \u00b5g purified SlPR1-MBP or SlChi3-MBP protein was incubated with protoplast in the presence of GFP or FolSvp1-GFP proteins pulled down from Fol for 4 hr. After uptake, the mixture was washed five times with 1 ml of water. Then, nuclear proteins were extracted with the Nuclear Extraction Kit (Solarbio) and analyzed by Western blotting. Disease assays [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-14) Pathogenicity tests were performed using the modified root dip method ( [Di et al., 2016](#bib13); [Zhang et al., 2021](#bib62)). In brief, 14-day-old tomato seedlings were uprooted from the soil, inoculated with a spore suspension (5\u00d7106 spores/ml) of Fol or mock-treated (no spores) for 10 min, and subsequently potted and kept at 25\u00b0C. Two weeks later, disease symptoms of 8-20 plants/treatment were scored using a disease index ranging from 0 to 5 (0, no symptoms; 1, C-terminal CAPE1 peptide can enhance tomato resistance, two groups of tomato plants were presprayed with water or synthetic CAPE1 for 8 hr as described previously ( [Chen et al., 2014](#bib8)). Then, the tomato seedlings were inoculated with the Fol conidia for disease assays. RNA extraction for qRT-PCR a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-15) For qRT-PCR essay, Fol-infected tomato roots were harvested at 0-5 days post inoculation. Infection was performed as follows: the harvested microconidia were suspended in 100 ml of water at a concentration of 5\u00d7106 spores/ml; 14-day-old tomato seedlings (40-50 seedlings/spot) were suspended microconidia and subsequently kept at 25\u00b0C. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (2 g) was used for reverse transcription with the PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa). Quantitative expression assays real-time PCR detection system. The relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the 2-ct method ( [Li et al., 2018a](#bib32)). Data were normalized against the SlActin gene (NC_015448.3). The primer pairs used for real-time PCR are listed in [Supplementary file 1c](/articles/82628/figures#supp1). Bioinformatic analyses [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap82628?item=s4-16) SP prediction was performed using the SignalP 5.0 server ( [http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/)). To generate the phylogenetic tree and sequence alignments, Blastp was used to search for homologs of FolSvp1 in the NCBI database ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)). Only hits with an E-value <1e-60 for which the alignment returned by BLAST spanned more than 60% of both the query and the subject sequence were included. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA-X. Multiple alignments were conducted using DNAMAN 6 software (Lynnon Biosoft, San Ramon, CA, USA). The online tool MEME ( [Bailey et al., 2009](#bib2)) was used to identify the potential conserved motifs of FolSvp1. The prediction of importin cNLS Mapper ( [Kosugi et al., 2009b](#bib29)). Statistical analysis was analysis of variance (ANOVA) or by unpaired Student's t-test methods.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Acetylation of a fungal effector that translocates host PR1 facilitates virulence\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Jian-Min Zhou as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jianfeng Li (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: The claim that FolSpv1-mediated translocation of SlPR1 into the nucleus impedes CAPE1 release needs to be further strengthened with additional data. Otherwise the claim needs to be toned down. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): The description of methods is not complete. How was in vitro protein uptake done? How was nuclear protein fractionation done? Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): 1. Ideally, the authors may want to test whether the bacterially expressed SlPR1 proteins can impair the Fol growth. 2. It is better to testify the localization of FolSvp1-SlPR1 interaction by BiFC using FolSvp1-overexpression Fol strain and SlPR1-overexpression transgenic tomato plants, because this is more close to physiological conditions. 3. The FolArd1 overexpression Fol strain is expected to be more virulent if the authors' model is correct. It is better to verify this point. 4. \"Western analyses\" should be \"Western blot analyses\". 5. Figure 1F, why the R mutant of FolSvp1 shows an equal abundance as WT and the Q mutant? 6. Figure 4F, why the FolSvp1 has no basal acetylation after being pulled down. 7. Figure 5B, NLS2 in the diagram was mistakenly labeled as NLS1. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.82628.sa1](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.82628.sa1) Author response Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): The description of methods is not complete. How was in vitro protein uptake done? How was nuclear protein fractionation done? We have added this information to the revised manuscript (lines 652-659). Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): 1. Ideally, the authors may want to test whether the bacterially expressed SlPR1 proteins can impair the Fol growth. We have discussed this possibility and stated that additional experiments are required in future studies in the revised manuscript (lines 436-444). 2. It is better to testify the localization of FolSvp1-SlPR1 interaction by BiFC using FolSvp1-overexpression Fol strain and SlPR1-overexpression transgenic tomato plants, because this is more close to physiological conditions. Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We have stated that the BiFC assays performed with N. benthamiana leaves might not completely mimic the physiological conditions and that new analyses using the FolSvp1-overexpression Fol strain and the SlPR1-overexpression tomato would greatly strengthen our conclusions in the revised manuscript (lines 439-444). 3. The FolArd1 overexpression Fol strain is expected to be more virulent if the authors' model is correct. It is better to verify this point. As shown in Figures 1-3, FolSvp1 is largely acetylated in the presence of tomato roots, and we guess that FolArd1 overexpression will have little effect on Fol virulence. We would like to verify this point in future studies. 4. \"Western analyses\" should be \"Western blot analyses\". Changes have been made (lines 135 and 185). 5. Figure 1F, why the R mutant of FolSvp1 shows an equal abundance as WT and the Q mutant? We loaded the same amount of the WT and mutant FolSvp1 proteins to compare their acetylation level. 6. Figure 4F, why the FolSvp1 has no basal acetylation after being pulled down. Only in the presence of tomato roots, FolSvp1 is acetylated and then stabilized. To investigate the effect of FolArd1, we pulled down FolSvp1 lack of acetylation from mycelia in the absence of tomato roots. We have indicated this information in the figure legends (lines 1041-1042). 7. Figure 5B, NLS2 in the diagram was mistakenly labeled as NLS1. Change has been made in the revised manuscript.

The model BMC is the carboxysome that encapsulates enzymes for CO2 fixation to increase efficiency and is found in many autotrophic bacteria, such as cyanobacteria. Despite their importance in the global carbon cycle, little is known about how carboxysomes are spatially regulated. We recently identified the two-factor system required for the maintenance of carboxysome distribution (McdAB). McdA drives the equal spacing of carboxysomes via interactions with McdB, which associates with carboxysomes. McdA is a ParA/MinD ATPase, a protein family well-studied in positioning diverse cellular structures in bacteria. However, the adaptor proteins like McdB that connect these ATPases to their cargos are extremely diverse. In fact, McdB represents a completely unstudied class of proteins. Despite the diversity, many adaptor proteins undergo phase separation, but functional roles remain unclear. Here, we define the domain architecture of McdB from the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and dissect its mode formation. We domain and a C-terminal domain that trimerizes McdB dimers and provides increased valency for condensate formation. We then identify critical basic residues in the IDR, which we mutate to glutamines to solubilize condensates. Finally, we find that a condensate-defective mutant of McdB has altered association with carboxysomes and influences carboxysome enzyme content. The results have broad implications for understanding spatial organization of BMCs and the molecular grammar "}
