Immunization pa tients Adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Technical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, August 2010. Purpose: To reduce morbidity and mortality from influenza by vaccinating all adults who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Policy: Under these standing orders, eligible nurses and other healthcare professionals (e.g., pharmacists), where allowed by state law, may vaccinate patients who meet any of the criteria below. Procedure: 1. Identify adults with no history of influenza vaccination for the current influenza season. 2. Screen all patients for contraindications and precautions to influenza vaccine: a. Contraindications: a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction after ingesting eggs, after receiving a previous dose of influenza vaccine, or to an influenza vaccine component. For a list of vaccine components, go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf. Do not give live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV; nasal spray) to an adult with a history of hypersensitivity to eggs, either anaphylatic or non-anaphylactic; who is pregnant, is age 50 years or older, or who has chronic pulmonary (includ- ing asthma), cardiovascular (excluding hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic/neuromuscular, hematologic, or metabolic (including diabetes) disorders; immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or HIV. b. Precautions: moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever; history of Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination; for TIV only, allergic reaction to eggs consisting of hives only (ob- serve patient for at least 30 minutes following vaccination); for LAIV only, close contact with an immunosup- pressed person when the person requires protective isolation, receipt of influenza antivirals (e.g., amantadine, riman- tadine, zanamivir, or oseltamivir) within the previous 48 hours or possibility of use within 14 days after vaccination 3. Provide all patients with a copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). You must docu- ment in the patient's medical record or office log, the publication date of the VIS and the date it was given to the patient. Provide non-English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if available and preferred; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. 4. Administer influenza vaccine as follows: a) For adults of all ages, give 0.5 mL of injectable trivalent inactivated in- deltoid muscle. (Note: A e\" needle may be used for adults weighing less than 130 lbs (<60 kg) for injection in the deltoid muscle only if the skin is stretched tight, subcutaneous tissue is not bunched, and the injection is made at a 90 degree angle; or b) For healthy adults younger than age 50 years, give 0.2 mL of intranasal LAIV; 0.1 mL is sprayed into each nostril while the patient is in an upright position; or c) For adults ages 18 through 64 years, give 0.1 ml TIV-ID intradermally by inserting the needle of the microinjection system at a 90 degree angle in the deltoid muscle; or d) For adults ages 65 years and older, give 0.5 mL of high-dose TIV-IM intramuscularly (22-25g, 1-1\u00bd\" needle) in the deltoid muscle. 5. Document each patient's vaccine administration information and follow up in the following places: a. Medical chart: Record the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot number, the vaccina- tion site and route, and the name and title of the person administering the vaccine. If vaccine was not given, record the reasons(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical contraindication, patient refusal). b. Personal immunization record card: Record the date of vaccination and the name/location of the administer- ing clinic. 6. Be prepared for management of a medical emergency related to the administration of vaccine by having a written emergency medical protocol available, as well as equipment and medications. 7. Report all adverse reactions to influenza vaccine to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at www.vaers.hhs.gov or (800) 822-7967.

Recommendations for the administration of influenza vaccine in children allergic to egg. BMJ. 2009;339:b3680.1. Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg should receive influenza vaccine. Because relatively little data are available for use of LAIV in this setting, IIV or RIV should be used. RIV is egg-free and may be used for persons aged 18-49 years who have no other contrain- dications. However, IIV (egg- or cell-culture based) may also be used, with the following additional safety measures (see figure in column to right) a) Vaccine should be administered by a healthcare provider who is familiar with the potential manifestations of egg allergy; and b) Vaccine recipients should be observed for at least 30 minutes for signs of a reaction after administration of each vaccine dose.1 2. Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving such symptoms as angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis; or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention may receive RIV3, if aged 18 through 49 years and there are no other contraindications. If RIV3 is not available or the recipient is not within the indicated age range, such persons should be referred to a physician with expertise in the management of allergic conditions for further risk assessment before receipt of vaccine (see figure in column to right). 3. All vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment for rapid recognition and treatment of anaphy- laxis are available. 4. Some persons who report allergy to egg might not be egg-allergic. Those who are able to eat lightly cooked egg (e.g., scrambled egg) without reaction are unlikely to be allergic. Egg-allergic per- sons might tolerate egg in baked products (e.g., bread or cake). Tolerance to egg-containing foods does not exclude the possibil - ity of egg allergy.2 Egg allergy can be confirmed by a consistent medical history of adverse reactions to eggs and egg-containing foods, plus skin and/or blood testing for immunoglobulin E anti - bodies to egg proteins. 5. For individuals who have no known history of exposure to egg, but who are suspected of being egg-allergic on the basis of pre- viously performed allergy testing, consultation with a physician with expertise in the management of allergic conditions should be obtained prior to vaccination (see figure in column to right). Alternatively, RIV3 may be administered if the recipient is aged 18 through 49 years. 6. A previous severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine, regardless of the component suspected to be responsible for the reaction, is a contraindication to future receipt of the vaccine. abbreviations LAIV = Live attenutated influenza vaccine IIV = Inactivated Influenza Vaccine RIV3 = Recombinant Influenza Vaccine, TrivalentAdapted from Summary* Recommenda- tions: Prevention and Control of Influ- enza with V accines: Recommendations of the AC IP-U.S., 2 013-14 at www.cdc. gov/flu/professionals/acip/2013-sum- mary-recommendations.htm.Influenza usually comes on suddenly . Symptoms can include high fever , chills, headaches, exhaustion, sore throat, cough, and all-over body aches. Some p eople say, \"It felt like a truck hit me!\" Symptoms can also be mild. Regardless, when influenza strikes your family, the result is lost time from work and school. An infected person can spread influenza when they cough, sneeze, or just talk near others. Th ey can also spread it by touching or sneezing on an object that someone else touches later . And, an infected person doesn't have to feel sick to be contagious: they can spread influenza to others when they feel well - before their symptoms have even begun. Each year , more than 200,000 people are hospitalized in the U.S. from influenza and its complications. Between 3,000 and 50,000 die, which shows how u npredictable influenza can be. The people most likely to be hospitalized and die are infants, young children, older adults, and people of all ages who have conditions such as heart or lung disease. But remember , it's not only the youngest, oldest, or sickest who die: E very year influenza kills people who were otherwise healthy . There's no substitute for yearly vaccination in protecting the people you lov e from influenza. Either type of influenza vaccine (the \"shot\" or nasal spray) will help keep you and your loved ones safe from a potentially deadly disease. Get vaccinated every year , and make sure your children and your parents are vaccinated, too.Influenza can make you, your children, or your parents really sick. Influenza spreads easily from person to person. Influenza and its complications can be so serious that they can put you, your children, or your parents in the hospital - or lead to death. Influenza can be a very serious disease for you, your family , and friends - but you can all be protected by getting vaccinated. Get vaccinated every year! Get your children vaccinated! Be sure your parents get vaccinated, too!copy this for your pa tients Don't take chances with your family's health - make sure you all get vaccinated against influenza every year! Here's how influenza can hurt your family reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, November 2010.INACTIVATED INFLUENZA VACCINE Why get vaccinated?1 Infl uenza (\"fl u\") is a contagious disease. It is caused by the in fl uenza virus, which can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or nasal secretions. Anyone can get in fl uenza, but rates of infection are highest among children. For most people, symptoms last only a few days. They include: fever/chills sore throat muscle aches fatigue cough headache runny or stuffy nose Other illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often mistaken for in fl uenza. Young children, people 65 and older, pregnant women, and people with certain health conditions - such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or a weakened immune system - can get much sicker. Flu can cause high fever and pneumonia, and make existing medical conditions worse. It can cause diarrhea and seizures in children. Each year thousands of people die from infl uenza and even more require hospitalization. By getting fl u vaccine you can protect yourself from infl uenza and may also avoid spreading in fl uenza others.Who should get inactivated infl uenza vaccine and when? 3 are two types of in fl uenza vaccine: 1.Inactivated (killed) vaccine, the \" fl u shot,\" is given by injection with a needle. 2.Live, attenuated (weakened) in fl uenza vaccine is sprayed into the nostrils. This vaccine is described in a separate Vaccine Information Statement. A \"high-dose\" inactivated in fl uenza vaccine is available for people 65 years of age and older. Ask your doctor for more information. Infl uenza viruses are always changing, so annual vaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause fl u that year. Flu vaccine will not prevent disease from other viruses, including fl u viruses not contained in the vaccine. It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the shot. Protection lasts about a year. WHO All people 6 months of age and older should get fl u vaccine. Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of severe infl uenza and their close contacts, including healthcare personnel and close contacts of children younger than 6 months. WHEN Get the vaccine as soon as it is available. This should provide protection if the fl u season comes early. You can get the vaccine as long as illness is occurring in your community. Infl uenza can occur at any time, but most in fl uenza occurs from October through May. In recent seasons, most infections have occurred in January and February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be bene cial in most years. Adults and older children need one dose of in fl uenza vaccine each year. But some children younger than 9 years of age need two doses to be protected. Ask your doctor. Infl uenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, including pneumococcal vaccine.Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages.

Ask your doctor for more information. Some people should not get inactivated infl uenza vaccine or should wait4 Tell your doctor if you have any severe (life-threatening) allergies, including a severe allergy to eggs. A severe allergy to any vaccine component may be a reason not to get the vaccine. Allergic reactions to in fl uenza vaccine are rare.

The following people should get the inactivated vaccine ( fl u shot) instead: Adults 50 years of age and older or children from 6 through 23 months of age . (Children younger than 6 months should not get either in fl uenza vaccine.) Children younger than 5 years with asthma or one or more episodes of wheezing within the past year. Pregnant women. People who have long-term health problems with: heart disease - kidney or liver disease- lung disease - metabolic disease, such as diabetes- asthma - anemia, and other blood disorders- Anyone with certain muscle or nerve disorders (such as seizure disorders or cerebral palsy) that can lead to breathing or swallowing problems. Anyone with a weakened immune system. Anyone in close contact with someone whose immune system is so weak they require care in a protected environment (such as a bone marrow transplant unit). Close contacts of other people with a weakened immune system (such as those with HIV) may receive LAIV . Healthcare personnel in neonatal intensive care units or oncology clinics may receive LAIV . Children or adolescents on long-term aspirin treatment. Tell your doctor if you have any severe (life-threatening) allergies, including a severe allergy to eggs. A severe allergy to any vaccine component may be a reason not to get the vaccine. Allergic reactions to in fl uenza vaccine are rare. Tell your doctor if you ever had a severe reaction after a dose of infl uenza vaccine. Tell your doctor if you ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS). Your doctor will help you decide whether the vaccine is recommended for you.Some people should not receive LAIV4 This policy and procedure shall remain in effect for all patients of the until rescinded or until (date). Medical Director's signature: Effective date:(name of practice or clinic)Purpose: To reduce morbidity and mortality from influenza by vaccinating all children and adolescents who meet the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Policy: Under these standing orders, eligible nurses and other healthcare professionals (e.g., pharmacists), where allowed by state law, may vaccinate children and adolescents who meet any of the criteria below. Procedure: 1. Identify children and adolescents ages 6 months and older who have not completed their influenza vaccination(s) for the current influenza season. 2. Screen all patients for contraindications and precautions to influenza vaccine: a. Contraindications: a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction after ingesting eggs, after receiving a previous dose of influenza vaccine, or to an influenza vaccine component. For a list of vaccine components, go to www.cdc.gov/ vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf. Do not give live attenuated influenza vac- cine (LAIV; nasal spray) to people with a history of hypersensitivity to eggs, either anaphylactic or non-anaphylac- tic; pregnant adolescents; children younger than age 2 yrs; children age 2 through 4 yrs who have experienced wheez- ing or asthma within the past 12 mos, based on a healthcare provider's statement; or children or adolescents with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (excluding hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic/neuromus- cular, hematologic, or metabolic (e.g., diabetes) disorders; immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or HIV; long-term aspirin therapy (applies to a child or adolescent age 6 mos through 18 yrs). b. Precautions: moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever; history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination; for TIV only, allergic reaction to eggs consisting of hives only (observe patient for 30 minutes following vaccination); for LAIV only, close contact with an immunosuppressed person when the person requires protective isolation, receipt of influenza antivirals (e.g., amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, or oseltamivir) within the previous 48 hours or possibility of use within 14 days after vaccination 3. Provide all patients (or, in the case of a minor, their parent or legal representative) with a copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). You must document in the patient's medical record or office log, the publication date of the VIS and the date it was given to the patient (parent/legal representative). Provide non-English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if available and preferred; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. 4. Administer inactivated vaccine (TIV) intramuscularly in vastus lateralis for infants (and toddlers lacking adequate deltoid mass) or in the deltoid muscle (for toddlers, children, and teens). Use a 22-25 g needle. Choose needle length appropriate to the child's age and body mass: infants 6 through 11 mos: 1 through 2 yrs: 1-13\"; 3yrs and older: 1-1\u00bd\". Give 0.25 mL to children 6-35 mos and 0.5 mL for all others age 3 yrs and older. (Note: A e\" needle may be used for patients weighing less that 130 lbs (<60kg) for injection in the deltoid muscle only if the skin is stretched tight, subcutaneous tissue is not bunched, and the injection is made at a 90-degree angle.) Alternatively, healthy children age 2 yrs and older may be given 0.2 mL of intranasal LAIV; 0.1 mL is sprayed into each nostril while the patient is in an upright position. Children age 6 mos through 8 yrs should receive a second dose 4 wks or more after the first dose if they are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time or if they did not receive at least 1 dose of vaccine in the 2010-2011 vaccination season. 5. Document each patient's vaccine administration information and follow up in the following places: a. Medical chart: Record the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot number, the vaccination site and route, and the name and title of the person administering the vaccine. If vaccine was not given, record the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical contraindication, patient refusal). b. Personal immunization record card: Record the date of vaccination and the name/location of the administering clinic. 6. Be prepared for management of a medical emergency related to the administration of vaccine by having a written emer- gency medical protocol available, as well as equipment and medications. 7. Report all adverse reactions to influenza vaccine to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at www.vaers.hhs.gov or (800) 822-7967.

IIV3 = egg-based and cell culture-based trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (injectable); w here necessary to refer to cell culture-based vaccine, the prefix \"cc\" is used (e.g., ccIIV3). recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (injectable). 2. On August 6, 2010, ACIP recommended that Afluria not be used in children younger than age 9 years. If no other age-appropriate IIV is available, Afluria may be considered for a child age 5 through 8 years at high risk for influenza complications, after risks and benefits have been discussed with the parent or guardian. Afluria should not be used in children younger than age 5 years. This recommendation con- tinues for the 2 013-2014 influenza season.Footnotes Free!
