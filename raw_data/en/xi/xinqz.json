NiSource Inc. NI continues to gain from its investments to strengthen its existing infrastructure and focus on clean energy. However, high debt level is a concern amid a rising interest environment. NiSource will make planned utility infrastructure investments and has identified long-term infrastructure investments worth $30 billion, with more than 90% of it allocated to regulated pipes and wires. Out of its planned $30 billion expenditure, the company will invest nearly $20 billion to strengthen its gas operations and $10 billion to boost its electricity operations. More than 75% of the capital expenditure will begin contributing to earnings within 12 months of investment. The continued investments will allow NiSource to deliver its targeted earnings and dividend growth of 5-7% through 2020. NiSource has a 100% regulated utility business model. Its planned regulated investments will improve reliability and safety of its services and provide efficient natural gas services to its increasing customer base. The company has made considerable progress on regulatory initiatives across the states where it operates. In addition, rate hikes already received by the company will help NiSource to continue with its infrastructure strengthening and modernization initiatives. The debt-to-capital level ratio of the company is 63.28%, much higher than the S&P 500 level of 41.90%. In addition, the current ratio of NiSource is 0.52, much lower than the S&P 500 level of 1.35. The long-term debts of the company at the end of the third quarter were $7.5 billion, higher than $6.1 billion at 2016 end. If the company's investment-grade credit rating drops from the present level, it could substantially increase the cost of borrowing of the company amid the rising interest rates.
