HAIR HAPPEN We are grateful for work and life in balance. Our joy is nurturing a healing, loving environment, both at home and within our global brand community. Joanne blends her styling talents with her healing touch to inspire, teach and create. Greg is our conscious chemist, an expert in green and clean formulations with a passion for educating beauty and wellness professionals, our retail partners and customers. MEET GREG Greg was immersed in the beauty industry as a child through his mother's successful cosmetic company. After working as a stylist for 12 years, Greg pursued an executive career in \"big beauty\" for some of the top hair care brands in the industry. Greg is the guiding light for Innersense Organic Beauty, our ingredient expert and a leading force in the clean beauty movement. His commitment to radical transparency raises the stakes on \"clean beauty\" with a focus on sustainably sourced, meticulously processed ingredients and an extensive \"never any\" list. MEET JOANNE Joanne was a salon stylist for over a decade before the birth of her special needs daughter inspired an awakening to the importance of living a clean and healthy lifestyle. Newly aware of the effects of harsh chemicals in personal care products, she made it her mission to develop clean, safe, non-toxic professional products for her family, salon colleagues and the clients they service. She is the heart and soul of Innersense Organic Beauty and the connection between clean, pure, beautiful products and the stylists and consumers who love them. A passionate proponent of self care and the sacred clean beauty movement, Joanne leads our wellness initiatives, designs our beloved hair ceremonies and empowers our community to tap into their innersense and fulfill their mind, body and spirit. All Because Two People Fell In Love MEET MAX AND MORGAN Morgan and Max are Innersense in the flesh, embodiments of everything our brand stands for: Family, love, acceptance and the belief that our inner light is our best light. Morgan, the inspiration behind our Quiet Calm Curl Control, loves to travel and all things Disneyland. A Broadway musical fanatic, she stars in so many of our Instagram videos as a joyful teacher and proponent of self love, laughter and fun. Despite being the younger sibling, Max's love for his sister is deep and instinctual. So is his love for baseball (he could talk it like a 40-year-old at the age of two!). Max is studying marketing and finance, and is himself a conversationalist in this family of big, bold personalities. "}
