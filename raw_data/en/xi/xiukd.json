Maybe you have no idea what they like but you want to give them a little token of your appreciation? Or perhaps you want to give something special but you need to watch your budget? Or maybe you just love DIY and are looking for unique homemade gift ideas! Whether it's for a teacher, your best friend or your mother-in-law, a homemade gift can be the perfect solution to your gift giving dilemmas! 36 Easy DIY Gifts I may receive commissions from purchases made through links in this article. [Full Disclosure](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/) To help you with your gift giving this year, I've put together a roundup of 36 of my favorite DIY gifts - including homemade food gifts, natural beauty products and some reusable, eco-friendly gifts for the home. Don't worry - these homemade gifts aren't super complicated or endless time-consuming. Even people who don't consider themselves super crafty can pull off these easy DIY wins! You may already have the ingredients in your cupboard for some of these gifts like sugar scrubs or spiced nuts. Others require a few ingredients easily picked up at a natural food store or online. We're not talking weeks of preparation. Once you've got the supplies, we're talking an hour or two at most (some much less), to make these DIY gifts. Sometimes the most special gift of all is something that is homemade. You can do this! RELATED: [Green & Healthy Gifts For Everyone on Your List](https://mindfulmomma.com/green-healthy-gifts/) Luxurious DIY Gifts - Homemade Beauty Products What I love about the gift of homemade beauty products - like scrubs, balms and bath soaks - is that you are inviting the recipient to pamper themselves!
