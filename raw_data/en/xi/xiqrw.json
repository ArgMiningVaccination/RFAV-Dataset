WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515Notes Numbers in the tables may not add up to totals because of rounding. In separate versions of this report, the listings of public laws in the appendixes are displayed in three ways\u2014by House authorizing committee, by Senate authorizing committee, and by appropriation act.Preface T his report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) satisfies the requirements of section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, as amended. The report must be completed by January 15 of each year and is intended to assist the Congress in determining the authorizing legislation that should be in place before it considers the regular appropriation bills for the upcoming fiscal year\u2014in this case, fiscal year 2009, which began on October 1, 2008. Ordinarily, this annual report shows the total amount that the Congress has provided in appropriation acts for programs whose authoriz ation has expired. However, only three appro- priation acts have been signed into law for fiscal year 2009\u2014those for Defense, Homeland Security, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. Programs covered by all of the other appropriation acts are currently funded under a continuing resolution (Public Law 110-329), which expires March 6, 2009. For those programs, no information is available about unauthorized funding for 2009 because the full-year appropriations have not yet been enacted. Appendix A, which lists those programs that have been funded in 2009 but whose appropriations have expired, notes that fact, and most entries do not include figures relating to the amount of unauthorized appropriat ions. Appendix B lists authorizations of appropriations that will expire by the end of fi scal year 2009. (That listing does not display any appropriation figures.)

Authorizations of Appropriations Expiring on or Before September 30, 2009, by Appropriation Act 6CBOUnauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations Overview Each January, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports to the Congress on: BAll programs and activities funded for the current fis- cal year for which authorizations for appropriations have expired and BAll programs and activities for which authorizations for appropriations will expire during the current fiscal year. That requirement is specified in section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The purpose of that provision is \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adopt authorizing legisla- tion that must be in place before the regular appropria- tion bills can be considered.\"1 The Role of Authorizations The term \"authorization\" is used to describe two types of laws. The first describes an \"organic,\" or \"enabling,\" stat- ute, which creates a federal agency, establishes a federal program, prescribes a federal function, or allows a partic- ular federal obligation or expenditure within a program. That type of authorization may allow a federal agency, program, or function to continue indefinitely, or it may allow it to continue only for a specific period. Such an authorization may constitute a direct spending program because it provides the direct authority to draw money from the Treasury to implement the statute, or it may simply specify a purpose for which a subsequent appro-priation is made available. Although enabling statutes, particularly those whose implementation depends on future appropriation action, are necessary for programs to operate, authorizations of that type are not the focus of this report. Instead, this report focuses on the second type of law described by the term \"authorization\": a specific provision that authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out the program or function established in the enabling stat-ute. Such a provision constitutes guidance to the Con-gress regarding the amount of funding that will be neces- sary to implement the enabling statute. An authorization of appropriations may be cont ained in the enabling stat- ute or may be provided separately. Such an authorization may be for a specific dollar amount (definite authoriza-tion) or for \"such sums as may be necessary\" (indefinite authorization) and may be permanent, multiyear, or annual. For the purposes of this report, an appropriation is considered unauthorized when it is made available for a program after that program's authorization of appropria-tions has expired. (This report does not address appropri-ations that have never been authorized.) House and Senate rules\u2014dating from the 19th cen- tury\u2014generally preclude the Congress from considering appropriations that are unauthorized. In both the House and the Senate, legislation containing unauthorized 1. H. Rept. 99-433, at 114 (1985) (Conference report accompany- ing the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, which amended the Congressional Budget Act to include the requirement for this report).2 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS CBOappropriations is subject to a point of order.2 However, House and Senate rules are not self-enforcing. An indi- vidual Representative or Senator must raise a point of order for the rules to be enforced. If no Member raises a point of order, an unauthorized appropriation may pro- ceed through the legislative process. Although this report is intended to aid the Congress by identifying those authorizations of appropriations that have expired or will expire, it should not be consid- ered definitive regarding the application of House or Sen- ate rules. What constitutes an \"unauthorized appropria-tion\" under such rules is determined by the precedents of the House or Senate, and the applicability of those rules is determined by the respective Office of the Parliamentarian. Listings of Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations This report covers all programs funded through the annual appropriation process that at one time had an explicit authorization of appropriations that has expired (see Appendix A) or will expi re this year (see Appendix B). Each program listing includes the number and name of the public law containing the last authorization, the last year that the authorization was in effect, and the amount (definite or indefinite) authorized in that year. In separate versions of this report, the listings of public laws in the appendixes are displayed in three ways\u2014by House authorizing committee, by Senate authorizing commit- tee, and by appropriation act. The information in this report is drawn from CBO's Leg- islative Classification System, a database reflecting all public laws that contain nonp ermanent authorizations of appropriations\u2014up to and including laws enacted during the second session of the 110th Congress. In general, House and Senate rules require the appropria- tions committees, in their reports on general appropria-tion bills, to identify any programs that are funded in the bills but lack an authorization\u2014including programs for which an explicit authorization of appropriations has never been enacted. This CBO report, as specified by law, covers only programs that at one time had an explicit authorization that either has expired or is scheduled to expire. Many laws also establ ish programs with an autho- rization of appropriations that does not expire. The reports of the appropriations committees as well as this report exclude programs with that type of authorization because its effect is permanent. Programs Funded in Fiscal Year 2009 with Expired Authorizations of Appropriations Ordinarily, Appendix A would list programs and activi- ties funded by an appropriation for fiscal year 2009 whose authorization has expired. However, only three appropriation acts have been signed into law so far this year\u2014those for the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. Programs covered by the other nine appropriation acts are currently funded by a continuing resolution that expires on March 6, 2009 (Public Law 110-329). For those pro- grams, this report omits figures and totals on unauthor- ized appropriations because information on full-year appropriations for 2009 is not available. If a program's authorization has expired but it received an explicit amount of funding in one of the three enacted appropriation acts, that amount is shown under \"Unau- thorized FY 2009 Appropriations\" in Appendix A. If no specific amount is provided (as in the case of a small program that is funded at an unidentified level in a large appropriation account, or a program that is funded in several appropriation accounts), CBO determines whether the program is still being funded and, if so, how much is allocated for it. If that amount cannot be determined, the listing notes that the specific dollar amount of unauthorized 2009 appropriations is \"not available\"\u2014meaning that it is not specifically identifiable. In recent years, the total amount of unauthorized appro- priations reported by CBO has generally ranged between $160 billion and $170 billion. The Unauthorized Appro- priations and Expiring Authorizations report that CBO published in January 2008, however, showed a consider-ably higher amount of unauthorized appropriations 2. A point of order is an objection raised by a Member of Congress against a piece of legislation or a procedure on the grounds that it violates the rules of the House or Senate. The Presiding Officer decides whether to sustain or overrule the point of order on the basis of the specific rule and precedents under it. The decision of the Presiding Officer is subject to appeal to the full House or Sen- ate, where it can be waived, generally by a majority vote.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 3 CBO($748 billion) because the National Defense Authoriza- tion Act for Fiscal Year 2008 had not been enacted at the time of publication. Subsequently, the act was signed into law, bringing the unauthorized appropriations amount down to about $160 billion. Several laws enacted in 2008 provided long-term reauthorizations for agencies or programs with annual appropriations. They include the Higher Education Opportunity Act (reauthorized through 2010), the Healthy Start Reauthorization Act of 2008 (through 2013), the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (through 2014), and the T rafficking Victims Pro- tection Reauthorization Act (through 2011). Lawmakers also enacted statutes that extended authorizations through 2009, including those for the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-istration. In addition, lawmakers enacted temporary authorizations for the Federal Aviation Administration (through March 31, 2009) and the Small Business Administration (through March 20, 2009). Authorizations of Appropriations That Expire on or Before September 30, 2009 For certain programs and activities, the authorization of appropriations expires by the end of fiscal year 2009. (Appendix B shows the amounts authorized to be appro- priated in 2009 for the expiring programs and activities, not the amounts actually appropriated for that year.) Definite authorizations contained in laws under the juris- diction of House and Senate authorizing committees that will expire by the end of this fiscal year totaled about $719 billion (see Tables 1, 2, and 3). Most of that amount (about $600 billion) is authorized in a single law, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (P .L. 109-417). Typically, authoriza-tions for defense funding are renewed annually. In contrast, the 2009 authorization act for intelligence activities has not yet been enacted. In the interim, law-makers enacted section 8080 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2009 (Division C of P .L. 110-329), which deems as authorized its appropria- tions for intelligence activities until the enactment of this year's intelligence authorization act. As in recent years, most of the total amount of definite authorizations of appropriations expiring this year is concentrated in a handful of laws. Of the 38 laws with such authorizations, eight account for almost all of the year's expiring definite authorizations. Some of the larger acts with definite authorizations for programs that are expiring in 2009 include the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (P .L. 109-59, with authorizations of $57.2 billion) and the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (P .L. 109-162, with authorizations of $24.1 billion). Laws with indefinite authorizations expiring in 2009 include the Child Nutri- tion and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (P .L. 108-265), the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P .L. 108-458), and the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 (P .L. 108-81).4 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS CBOTable 1.
