RESPONSIBILITIES OF ALL IMMUNIZATION PROVIDERS 1. What are my accountabilities as an immunization provider? All immunization providers of all publicly funded vaccines, including influenza and pneumococcal, shall practice according to the New Brunswick Immunization Program Guide (NBIPG) . This includes but is not limited to: Reporting to Public Health All Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) are to be reported to the local Regional Health Authority(RHA) Public Health as per Policy 2.7 and Standard 3.8 of the New Brunswick Immunization Program Guide and using the New Brunswick AEFI Report Form found at: https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/h - s/pdf/en/CDC/Epidemiology/NBAEFIFormE.pdf Proof of immunization Regulation 2009 -136, section 14 under the Public Health Act requires that all immunization providers provide the client with a proof of immunization. Immunization cards are available at your local RHA Public Health office. Management of Vaccine/Cold Chain (see Q 13) Competency All providers of publicly funded vaccine shall be deemed competent by their employing agency as per Policy 2.4 of the New Brunswick Immunization Program Guide . Safety Immunization providers must ensure that: Adrenaline is present during vaccine administration. The 15-minute post-vaccination observation period should be maintained for settings that can adhere to appropriate public health and infection prevention and control measures. A shorter post-vaccination observation period, between 5 to 15 minutes after influenza immunization, may be considered, but only when appropriate physical distancing in post- vaccination waiting areas cannot be maintained due to the number of individuals being immunized, and only when the following specific conditions are met: Do we still need this section , this year? Past history of receipt of influenza vaccine and no known history of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) to any component of the influenza vaccine being considered for administration 2022 -2023 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Information for Immunization Providers For ongoing information on influenza activity, see report is posted our our weekly NB flu website at: http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/ocmoh/cdc/content/influenza/influenza_sur veillance_activities.html 4 No history of other immediate post-vaccination reactions (e.g., syncope with or without seizure) after receipt of any vaccines. The vaccine recipient is accompanied by a parent/guardian (in the case of a child) or responsible adult who will act as a chaperone to monitor the vaccine recipient for a minimum of 15 minutes post-vaccination. In the case of two responsible adults, both can be vaccine recipients for the purposes of this criterion, if both agree to monitor the other post-vaccination. The vaccine recipient will not be operating a motorized vehicle or self-propelled or motorized wheeled transportation (e.g., bicycle, skateboard, rollerblades, scooter), or machinery for a minimum of 15 minutes after vaccination. The vaccine recipient and the parent/guardian or responsible adult chaperone are aware of when and how to seek post-vaccination advice and given instructions on what to do if assistance and medical services are required. The vaccine recipient and the parent/guardian/responsible adult agree to remain in the post- vaccination waiting area for the post-vaccination observation period and to notify staff if the recipient feels or looks at all unwell before leaving. They should be informed that an individual exhibiting any symptom suggestive of an evolving AEFI at the end of the shortened post- observation period necessitates a longer period of observation in the clinic. The immunization is documented including the lot number of the vaccine. This is important information in the event there is a vaccine recall or an individual experience an adverse event following immunization (AEFI). Ordering / Receiving Vaccine Distribution of influenza vaccine is expected to begin in early October with administration to start mid -October. The launch date for the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Program will be announced once vaccine delivery to the province is confirmed. , New Brunswick receives a percentage of the overall influenza vaccine order for the season in four or more shipments over several weeks, so you will not receive 100% of your vaccine order in the beginning. Although vaccination before the onset of the influenza season is strongly preferred (in October or early November), vaccine providers should use every opportunity to give influenza vaccine during the current season, even after influenza activity has been documented in the community (after April). Regional Public Health will only release vaccine to immunization providers who bring insulated containers large enough to hold vaccine, ice/gel pack, insulating materials, and temperature monitoring devices (min-max thermometers). See Standard 3.4 Vaccine Storage and Handling Influenza vaccine orders should be placed as per below by Sept.15, 2023. Distribution will follow McKesson's regular delivery schedule (used for COVID vaccine) which is a specific day on a weekly basis. Please plan your clinics accordingly to ensure you have a confirmed date of delivery before you schedule ap pointments. Influenza Vaccine Ordering process Immunization provider Where to order influenza vaccine Health care practitioners (physicians, nurse practitioners, midwives , community health centres ) serviced by a sub -depot for routine vaccine deliveries.

Public Health and Sub-depots PH and Sub-depots enter orders directly into the PHIS through Product Requisition. The product is distributed from McKesson to PH offices and sub-depots. Product Information for Pharmacies: Supplier Product Reporting Administration of Influenza Vaccines Physicians/Nurse Practitioners - all influenza vaccines administered by physicians/NPs and submitted to Medicare for billing purposes are captured in the Public Health Information Solution (PHIS) through integration of the two systems. Physicians/NPs do not have to 6 complete paper admin forms for vaccines submitted to medicare. Pharmacists - all influenza vaccines administered by pharmacists and entered into the Drug Information System (DIS) are captured in the Public Health Information Solution (PHIS) through integration of the two systems. Pharmacists do not have to complete paper admin forms for influenza vaccines recorded in DIS. First Nation Community Health Centres - Community Health Nurses administering influenza vaccines in First Nation Communities who do not have access to PHIS need to submit paper admin forms (follow the process below). Nursing Homes/ARFS - Nursing homes/ARFs who have their own nursing staff administer influenza vaccine need to submit paper admin forms (follow the process below). If physicians or pharmacists administer influenza vaccine in these facilities, they do not have to complete paper admin forms if they are recording vaccines in medicare or DIS. EMP - EMP have staff for direct data entry. All admin forms that they are unable to enter will be submit ted. (follow the process below). Process for Submitting Paper Admin forms There are two process options for submitting data entry of the paper administration/consent forms for influenza and Pneumococcal. It is very important that forms are filled out completely and accurately. 1. Vaccine administration data forms are sent electroni cally to SharePoint drop box site or received by fax to email. the paper administrative/consent forms can be emailed to the data entry team by fax to email using 1 -833-415-1830; forms should not be directly emailed to data entry email address; mobile devis es cannot be used unless it is a secure device, approved by GNB. those with approved access to the designated SharePoint site, can scan the paper administrative/consent forms and place into Drop Box - All Documents (gnb.ca). 2. Forms can be sent via Canada Post Xpress or Purolator which should only be used when the first option is not feasible. No other (than courier) transportation methods should be used. The forms must be placed in an envelope with a sealed the flap and initials written on the flap. A vaccine consent forms manifest should be included in the envelope with the following information: total number of consent forms included first and last name of person preparing envelope date package was prepared Then courier to: C/O Data Entry Team GNB, Department of Health HSBC Place, 520 King Street, 4th Floor Reception Fredericton, NB E3B 5G8 An email must be sent to Phisisp@gnb.ca each time an envelope is mailed, notifying them that an envelope has been sent. Include the following information in the email: # of admin forms in envelope Tracking number for envelope ELIGIBILITY 2. Who is eligible for publicly funded 2022-2023 seasonal influenza vaccine? A universal influenza vaccine program is publicly funded for all New Brunswick residents. Quadrivalent influenza vaccine is offered to individuals aged six months and older including residents of long-term care facilities who are under the age of 65 years at no cost to the recipients.7 Fluzone\u00ae High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine is offered to all those aged 65 years and older at no cost to the recipients. The High dose vaccine has four times the concentration of influenza virus antigen as the standard inactivated influenza vaccine which is intended to give the older people a stronger immune response, and therefore, better protection against influenza . The Fluzone\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent is not licenced for under 65 years of age and is not publicly funded for any other indication (ex: immunocompromised client) It is important to respect the eligibility criteria as vaccine supply is based on specific cohort populations and if given outside the criteria, we may not have sufficient supply avai lable to give to those who are eligible and at higher risk of more severe outcomes. For more information, please check the website at: www.gnb.ca/flu 2022-2023 VACCINE COMPONENTS/PRODUCTS 3. What High-Dose is a four-component (quadrivalent) inactivated influenza vaccine that is licensed specifically, for people 65 years and older. The High-Dose vaccine contains four times the antigen of standard -dose inactivated influenza vaccines which is intended to give older people a stronger immune response (i.e., higher antibody levels), and therefore, better protection against influenza. 4. What are the components of the 2022-2023 seasonal influenza vaccines? It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines for use in the 2022- 2023 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following: Egg-based vaccines an dose vials. A small quantity of Fluzone\u00ae Quadrivalent single use pre-filled syringes will be Quadrivalent is supplied in pre-filled syringes. SIDE EFFECTS/CONTRAINDICATIONS 6. What are the side effects of the seasonal influenza vaccine? One third of those immunized report soreness at the injection site for up to two days. Flu-like symptoms (fever, sore muscles, and tiredness) may occur within 6 to 12 hours after immunization 8 and last 1 to 2 days, especially in those receiving the vaccine for the first time. Anaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions occur rarely. 7. Can the seasonal influenza vaccine cause influenza illness? The seasonal influenza vaccine does not contain live virus and therefore cannot cause influenza. 8. Who should NOT routinely be given seasonal influenza vaccine? The following people should not routinely receive seasonal influenza vaccine: Infants less than 6 months of age. People who have had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any of the components of influenza vaccine (with the exception of egg). People who have a serious acute febrile illness . People known to have had Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccine . It is not known whether influenza vaccination is causally associated with increased risk of recurrent GBS in persons with a previous history of GBS due to any cause. Avoiding subsequent influenza vaccination of persons known to have had GBS within six weeks of a previous influenza vaccination appears prudent at this time. 9. Should people who have experienced Ocular Respiratory Syndrome (ORS) following receipt of a previous seasonal influenza vaccine be immunized with the seasonal influenza vaccine? Oculo -respiratory syndrome (ORS), which is defined as the presence of bilateral red eyes and one or more associated symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, or sore throat) that starts within 24 hours of vaccination, with or without facial edema, was found during the 2000 -2001 influenza season; few cases have been reported since then. ORS is not considered to be an allergic response. There is no evidence to suggest that oculo -respiratory syndrome (ORS) will be a concern followingimmunization. Individuals who have experienced ORS, including those with a severe presentation (bilateral red eyes, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, facial swelling) but without lower respiratory tract symptoms, may be safely re-immunized with influenza vaccine. Persons who experienced ORS with lower respiratory tract symptoms (wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing) within 24 hours of immunization, an apparent significant allergic reaction to theimmunization or any other symptoms (throat constriction, difficulty swallowing) that raise concernsregarding the safety of re-immunization should have a consultation with a Medical Officer of Healthor another expert. 10. Should people who are allergic to eggs receive the seasonal influenza vaccine? All influenza vaccine products authorized for use in Canada are manufactured by a process involving chicken eggs, which may result in the vaccines containing trace amounts of residual egg protein. NACI has concluded that egg allergic individuals without other contraindications may be vaccinated against influenza (with any product) without a prior influenza vaccine skin test and with the full dose. The vaccine may be given in any settings where vaccines are routinely administered. As with any vaccine, immunizers should always be prepared for and have the necessary equipment to respond to a vaccine emergency. For further information please see the Canadian Immunization Guide Chapter on Influenza and Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2022 - 2023 9 11. Should pregnant women receive the seasonal influenza vaccine? All pregnant women should receive seasonal influenza immunization, as evidence demonstrates they are at higher risk of complications from influenza. 12. Is seasonal influenza vaccine safe for breastfeeding mothers? Seasonal influenza vaccine is safe for breastfeeding mothers. VACCINE STORAGE/ADMINISTRATION 13. How should the seasonal influenza vaccines be stored? Influenza vaccine must be stored between 2 \u00b0C - 8 \u00b0C at all times. The vaccine should not be frozen and must be protected from light. If vaccine is exposed to an adverse storage condition, please contact the manufacturer first for instructions. Any unused/outdated vaccine is to be returned to CSD, McKesson Canada, or Matrix Distribution Centre. Attention must be paid to the duration of stability of vaccine once it has been opened. 14. How long can a vial of influenza vaccine be used once it is opened? An opened vial of Flulaval Tetra must be used within 28 days from the date it was opened. A multidose vial of Fluzone\u00ae or FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose which has been entered and stored at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C may be used up to the expiry date indicated on the vial label. 15. Can I draw up the seasonal influenza vaccine into syringes to be used at a later time? The manufacturer has no data to confirm that immunogenicity of the product will be preserved after prolonged exposure to the plastic of the syringe. The company also has concerns regarding bacterial contamination. Therefore, influenza vaccine should be injected as soon as possible after being drawn up. 16. How is the seasonal influenza vaccine administered? The seasonal influenza vaccine is administered intramuscularly. The deltoid muscle is the recommended site in adults/ older children (> 1 year old). The anterolateral thigh is the recommended site in infants (< 1 year old) DOSAGE 17. What is the dosage and frequency of the seasonal influenza vaccines? For intramuscular quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), the dose is 0.5 ml for all age groups. Recommended Influenza Vaccine Doses by Age Age Group Dose No. of Doses 9 years and older 0.5 ml 1 6 months -8 years* 0.5 ml 1 or 2* QIV for under 65 years old 0.5 ml 1 65+ and receiving FluZone HD 0.7 ml 1 10 * Children 6 months to less than 9 years of age who have never received the seasonal influenza vaccine require two doses of influenza vaccine, with a minimum interval of four weeks between doses. Eligible children <9 years of age who have received one or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine in the past should receive one dose per season thereafter. IMMUNOGENICITY AND EFFICACY 18. How soon following immunization does protection develop and how long does it last? Protection from the seasonal influenza vaccine generally begins 10 to 14 days after immunization and may last 6 months or longer. ADMINISTRATION OF OTHER VACCINES 19. Can you receive seasonal influenza vaccine before or after having donated/received blood or Immune Globulin? Yes. 20. Can seasonal vaccine, adult pertussis vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine be given at the same time? Yes, they can be administered at the same time, but they should be administered via separate syringes in different sites. Pneumococcal immunization is recommended once in a lifetime, except in certain high- risk individuals as specified in the Canadian Immunization Guide. Pertussis vaccine is recommended in childhood and adolescence, once as an adult, and during every pregnancy ideally between 27 and 32 weeks of gestation. 21. Can seasonal influenza vaccine be administered if other noncovid -19 vaccines have been received recently? You can administer seasonal influenza vaccine if other vaccines have been received recently. There is no interval of time needed between receiving seasonal influenza vaccine and other nonCovid -19 vaccines. 22. Can seasonal influenza vaccine be administered simultaneously with a Covid -19 vaccine? Yes, seasonal influenza vaccine can be co-administered (given at the same time) with a Covid -19 vaccine. 23. Can seasonal influenza vaccine be administered if a Covid -19 vaccine has been received recently? Seasonal influenza vaccine can be administered regardless of when Covid -19 vaccine had been or going to be received. In other words, there are no time interval requirements between the influenza and covid -19 vaccines. MORE INFORMATION 24. Where can I get more information on seasonal influenza vaccine?
