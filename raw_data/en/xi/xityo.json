Public and healthcare workers (HCWs) were concerned about the safety of the vaccine, especially in light of the use of new technologies. A review regarding attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinationfound a 22.5% hesitancy rate among HCWs. Online anonymous questionnaires were delivered using a web-based surveying platform to community HCWs in a central district in Israel from 3 to 19 January 2021. The real COVID-19 vaccination data were collected between thebeginning of the vaccination rollout and the end of the month after the survey as well as the real vaccination rate among the general population. Of the 3,172 HCWs, 549 (17%) responded to the questionnaire. The highest positive attitude towards the vaccine was among physicians(95%), while nurses showed the highest level of hesitation (14%) for a specific sector ( P<0 . 0 5 ) . However, the real vaccination rates were similar among physicians (63%) and nurses (62%). Surprisingly, the total vaccination rate of HCWs was substantially lower (52%) than that of the general population (71%). The main vaccinat ion motivators were the social and economic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic. Focused strategies to reduce the level of hesitancy among HCWs are needed. Introduction In March 2020, COVID-19 (caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2)) was recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a worldwide pandemic. It went on to affect over 5 million people across 215 countries or territories, causing more than 300,000 fatalities worldwide by the end of May 2020 [ 1,2]. The first vaccine to be authorised was the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BioNTech (BNT) 162b2 mRNA), which was approved by the FDA with Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) on 11 December 2020 [ 1]. In Israel, the administration of the vaccine began on 19 December 2020, in an official government operation called 'Give a Shoulder '[2]. At that time, Israel experienced a second wave of morbidity, with 2,734 new cases on 19 December (294.26 per million) and 3,074 cumulative deaths (330.86 per million) [ 3]. For vaccines to be effective in a pandemic, they should provide 'herd immunity 'by exceeding a threshold rate of vaccinating many people. However, although the scientific and medical community demonstrated a remarkable and one-of-a-kind success in developing fast and very efficient vaccines, these fast and new technologies translated into fears in many sectors of society,including among physicians and nurses. Strategies to increase adherence to vaccination and to identify the contributing factors affecting vaccine acceptance were studied in many coun- tries. Healthcare workers (HCWs) played a key role in influencing the general public 's decisions about whether or not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [ 4,5]. In a systematic review conducted in January 2021 which studied the attitudes towards vaccination uptake for COVID-19, it was found that the lowest rates (below 60%) were in Italy, Russia, Poland, the United States, France, Kuwait, and Jordan, whilst the highest rates (above90%) were in Ecuador, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China [ 7]. In studies from the general population, it has been shown that COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy, and vaccine hesitancy in general, is a complex decision-making process that involvescultural, sociodemographic, emotional, and political factors [ 4,6]. Higher odds of vaccine hesitancy were found in persons with lower levels of concerns about being infected as compared to very concerned ((Odds ratio (OR) = 3.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.39 -6.03, P= A, Shkalim Yosef Nand Shlomi D (2023).

A few studies conducted in late 2020 and early 2021 suggest that many HCWs also have doubts regarding vaccinations, with the highest hesitancy rate measured in Congo and the lowest in China (72% and 4.3%, respectively). In the USA, the hesitancy rates indifferent countries range between 8% and 18% [ 8-11]. A review of 35 studies by Biswas et al. was performed to explore the nature and extent of COVID 19 vaccination hesitancy among HCWs in dif- ferent countries and their main concerns [ 8]. The average hesitancy rate of HCWs was 22.5%, with very similar concerns to those identified in the general population. One of those studies wasconducted in Israel in March 2020, in which 1,941 anonymousquestionnaires were completed by hospital and community HCWs and members of the general population regarding the positive attitude towards a potential COVID-19 vaccine [ 11]. This study revealed that vaccine-positive attitudes among nurses were signifi- cantly lower than those among physicians and the tion (61%, 78%, 75%, respectively, P< 0.01). HCWs in internal medicine departments displayed a significantly higher positive attitude than those in general surgery departments (91% versus 75%, respectively, P< 0.01). The aim of this study is to explore attitudes towards the new COVID-19 vaccine among community HCWs in the centre of Israel at the beginning of the mass vaccination drives. Additionally, we explored the factors that affect their intention to accept thevaccine and the reasons for hesitancy or refusal to accept the vaccine. Then, we compared the questionnaire results to the real documented vaccination rate of the HCWs and the general popu-lation in the district during the same period. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Dan-Petah- Tiqwa district (in the centre of Israel) of 'Clalit Health Services ' (CHS), the largest publicly funded Health Maintenance Organ- ization (HMO) in Israel. The study population consisted of all HCWs aged 18 years in the district. Online anonymous ques- tionnaires were delivered between 3 January and 19 January 2021, using Google Forms as a surveying platform. Using 'Nemala+ 'platform, Top Solutions (L.H.B) Ltd. [ 12], we calcu- lated the sample size (minimal response rate) needed in our population of 3,172 health workers to be 506 for a 95% CI and a 4% margin of error. The questionnaire included sociodemo-graphic data (age group, gender, and healthcare sector) andattitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination questions (intention to be vaccinated and the reason for willingness or avoidance). Participants were also asked to grade their tendency to try newexperiences such as new food. Data regarding the real COVID-19 vaccination among these HCWs between the beginning of vac- cination (19 December 2020) and the end of the next month afterthe survey (28 February 2021) were also extracted and analysed. Participants were divided into five sector groups: physicians, nurses, administration & logistic s, pharmacists, and other health professions (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietitian, speech-therapy, social work, psychology, paramedics, medics, phlebotomist, and medical technicians). The study was approvedby the institutional review board (IRB) of Meir MedicalCenter, Kfar-Saba, Israel (approval no. COM1 -0087-21). Since the survey was conducted anonymously and all other data wereretrieved retrospectively, the IRB approved conducting this study without obtaining signed in formed consent from the study participants. Statistical analysis Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Chi-square and Cramer 's tests were used to compare categorical data. The distribution of the data was evaluated with the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test. The Mann -Whitney U test and Kruskal -Wallis test were used. Results During 17 days in January 2021, 549 out of 3,172 (17%) HCWs in the Dan-Petah-Tiqwa district answered the questionnaires. The demographic and general characteristics of the participants are described in Table 1 . Most of the participants -414 (75.4%) -were female, but no gender difference was found with respect to vac-cination attitude. The majority of the HCWs who answered the questionnaires were in the 31 -50 age group (279, 51%). The vaccine-positive attitude rates were higher as age increased(92% at the age of 51 versus 67% between 18 and 30 years, P= 0.001). The highest positive attitude towards the vaccine was among physicians (95%), while nurses showed the highest level of hesi-tation (14%) for a specific sector ( P=0 . 0 5 ) .T h er e a ld o c u m e n t e d vaccination rates of the HCWs in the Dan-Petah-Tiqwa district between the beginning of the vaccination drive and the end of themonth after the survey show a different picture ( Table 2 ). The average vaccination rate was 52%. The highest vaccination rates were similar among physicians (63%) and nurses (62%), while thelowest vaccination rates were among the administration and logistics (41%) and other health profession (45%) sectors (P< 0.001). Unfortunately, data regarding the gender and age of H C W sw h ow e r ev a c c i n a t e dw e r ei n a c c e s s i b l ed u et ot h ep r i v a c ypolicy. The data regarding the general population vaccination rate in the district are described in Table 3 . The age of retirement in Israel is 67, yet many continue to work for a few more years; hence, the data refer to ages 18 -70 to match the ages of the respondents to the survey. As expected, the vaccination rates increased as a function ofage ( P< 0.001). No significant differences were found between genders. Most of the study participants (397, 72.3%) declared that they were already vaccinated with the first dose, and 15.1% declaredthat they were willing to be vaccinated. A small group stated that they would postpone vaccination until a mass of people were vaccinated (4.4%). Only a small percentage declared that theywere hesitant or not intending to receive the vaccine (1.6% and 1.8%, respectively). In the survey, participants mentioned reasons for accepting or declining the vaccine ( Table 4 ). The major reasons for vaccine acceptance were personal (fear of being infected or infecting family members with COVID-19) and social (decreasing overall morbid-ity and improving the economic state). The two main reasons for hesitancy were fear of the rapid development process of the COVID-19 vaccine (52.5%) and the unknown side effects of theCOVID-19 vaccine in Israel (50%). Among the survey participants,10% believed that the COVID-19 vaccine was unnecessary, and 2.5% believed that any kind of vaccine was unnecessary.2 Assaf Halevi et al. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268823000961 Published online by Cambridge University PressTable 3.

Forty-one percent of the vaccinatedand 48% of the hesitators replied that they enjoyed it very much. Additionally, 21% and 30% of the vaccinated and hesitator groups, respectively, answered that they enjoy new behaviours to a small extent or not at all. No correlation was found between the answers to this question and attitudes towards the COVID- 19 vaccine. Discussion This study examined the attitudes of HCWs in one district of CHS towards the COVID-19 vaccine at the beginning of the vaccinationrollout in Israel through a survey. Survey answers were compared to the real vaccination status of the HCWs as well as the general population from the beginning of the vaccination rollout to theend of the month after the survey. Out of 3,172 HCWs in our district, 549 (17%) responded to the survey. Our study met the minimal criteria for the calculated response rate of 506 (16%)completed surveys. According to the survey results, the mostprominent factor for holding a positive attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine is age (67% versus 92% among 18 -30 and51 years old, respectively, P= 0.001), while gender has no influence on vaccine-positive attitudes ( Table 1 ). According to the survey, an MD degree expressed the highest pro-vaccine attitude, while nurses had the lowest positive attitudetowards vaccination (95% versus 82%, respectively, P= 0.05). Other surveys showed similar res ults in which nurses expressed a higher hesitancy rate towar ds the COVID-19 vaccine. For example, as mentioned in the introduction, in Israel at thebeginning of the pandemic, nurses had lower positive attitudes than physicians and the general population (61%, 78%, 75%, respectively, P<0 . 0 1 )[ 11]. A study conducted in Greece in 2020 among 500 HCWs in five hospitals found higher positiveattitudes among physicians (60.7%) than among nurses (34%) and paramedics P< 0.001) [ 13]. A survey among 1,398 HCWs in the USA found higher rates of positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination a mong physicians than among nurses (94.5% versus 77.7%, respectively, difference = 16.8%,95%; CI 9.5 -24.2) [ 14]. Another study was conducted among 12,034 HCWs in two hospitals in Philadelphia in December 2020 [15]. Among 11 variables that were significantly associated with intention or hesitation to receive the vaccine, the two most influential factors were age ( 65 versus < 40, OR = 3.50; 95% CI 2.50 -4.90, P< 0.0001) and the level of education (postgraduate degree versus less than a Bachelor 's degree, OR = 4.59; 95% CI 3.83-5.50, P< 0.0001). Unlike our finding, another significant factor in this study was that the male gender had a higher likelihood of having a positive attitude towards a future vaccinethan the females (OR = 2.41, 95% CI 2.12 -2.75, P< 0.001), presumably due to increased morb idity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in males. The male gender was also found to bean enabling factor for vaccination in 25 of 35 (71%) of the studies in a comprehensive review of a ttitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to older age and a higher level of education( 2 3o f3 5s t u d i e s )[ 8]. In the real documented vaccination data of the HCWs, at the end of the month after the survey, the total vaccination rate wassubstantially lower (52%) than the positive attitudes, as wasdemonstrated in the survey (88%). There were no differences between physicians and nurses (63% and 62%, respectively), while administration and logistics workers demonstrated the highestdifference between the intention to be vaccinated (87%) and the real vaccination data (41%). It appears that more physicians with a positive attitude towards the vaccine (95%) were more willing toanswer the questionnaire than physicians in other sectors. How- ever, in real life, the overall vaccination rate was lower and with less difference between physicians and nurses. Another possibleexplanation is social desirability bias, which is the tendency ofTable 4.

Physicians are more expected to show a positive attitude towards the vaccine coupled with the time in which the survey was conducted in which a major governmentcampaign calling for mass vaccination was initiated. The lowest vaccination rate among the administration and logistics workers could be explained by the high proportion of young people inthese sectors ( 'National Service 'duty as a replacement for man- datory military service). A surprising fact was that in the real vaccination data (at least one vaccine), the general population in the district had a higher rate (71%) than the HCWs (52%) at the same time. However, age and gender analysis could not be performed for the HCWs, asmentioned above. Those high rates of vaccination in a noticeablyshort duration are globally uni que. According to the global database of COVID-19 vaccinations, on 28 February 2021, 50.92% of the Israeli population received at least one vaccinedose, compared to the United Kingdom, Bahrain, and the United States, which have the closest rates (41.7%, 20.77%, and 15.9%, respectively) [ 3]. As expected, age in the general population had a significant contribution to vaccine acceptance ( P< 0.001). The age finding is in line with the known literature. A scoping review summarising thekey findings of 22 studies conducted in August 2021 counted agegroup among the most common factors influencing attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine along with gender education and employment status [ 17]. One example is from a global study conducted in June 2020, a survey of 13,462 participants from 19 countries that found that age was a significant factor for a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination, with the highestpositive attitude among older individuals (65+) compared to younger individuals (18 -24, OR = 1.73; 95% CI 1.48 -2.02) [ 18]. Gender in our study had no effect on actual vaccination in the general population; however, in two studies from the UK (n = 2,025) and Ireland (n = 1041), females were significantly more hesitant (OR = 1.43 and 1.62 in the UK and Ireland,respectively) [ 19]. Another study conducted in the US at the beginning of vaccination also found that men are overall less likely than women to have vaccine hesitancy (log OR, /C00.13; P<0 . 0 0 1 )[ 20]. The average hesitancy rate in our survey was 8% ( Table 1 ), which is relatively low compared to the average hesitancy rate of HCWs (22.5%) that was found in Biswas et al. 's review [ 8]. Among them, another study in a medical centre in northern Israel that was conducted a year before (in March 2020) found a hesitancy rate of 28.5% among HCWs [ 11]. This difference may be partially explained by the fact that the former Israeli study was conducted 7 months before the vaccine became available and the concerns regarding a future unknown vaccine were high. Furthermore, oncethe COVID-19 vaccine became available, the effect of the pandemicon day-to-day life was remarkably high, and the authorities conducted a massive media campaign, officially named 'Give a Shoulder '. The main vaccination motivators in the survey were social a n de c o n o m i ce f f e c t so ft h eC O V I D - 1 9e p i d e m i c( 'Iw i s ht h e morbidity rate will decrease and economic situation willrecover ')a sw e l la sp e r s o n a lr e a s o n s( 'I am afraid to infect my family members with COVID-19 ';'I am afraid to be infected by COVID-19 '). The main concerns for hesitancy were vaccine safety and side effects, similar to the conclusions of Biswaset al. 's scope study that comprised 35 HCWs around the world and showed that more than 75% of them found concernsregarding safety, efficacy, and side effects [ 8]. These concerns resemble hesitancy in the general population, as shown in a Joshi et al. scoping review comprising 22 studies, 17 of which found safety and potential side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine to be amajor concern [ 17]. Limitations of this study include a relatively small respondent group out of all the district employees. Furthermore, data regardingHCWs 'vaccination status did not include demographic variants and morbidity history due to ethical issues. In summary, a high proportion of HCWs (88%) declared their positive attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine, while the actual vaccination data were substantially lower (52%). These differences were high among the physicians (95% versus 63%); however, thelargest differences were among the administration and logisticsworkers (87% versus 41%). Furthermore, the vaccination rate among HCWs was lower than the rate in the public during the same time period. The vaccination motivators were personal andsocial in similar percentages. Although these are partial data, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare survey data to true vaccination data. We conclude that survey-based works should be interpreted cautiously, especially in HCW studies in which social desirability bias is enhanced, in which the prevailing opinion is pro-vaccinationand expression of hesitancy is considered taboo. In reality ofuncertainty, the concern about the unknown side effects and the new widespread vaccine technology carry weight in the decision to accept a new vaccine, even in the HCW community. We believe thatincreasing the advocacy efforts among HCWs, especially among nurses, such as conducting informative meetings and making information accessible, may increase the vaccination rates withinthe HCW population and may have a further positive effect on attitudes towards the vaccine among certain individuals in the general population.
