There is a space-age clinic housing some of Germany's, if not Europe's, top medical experts in the fields of gynaecology, dentistry, cardiology, preventative medicine, holistic medicine and aesthetics, with the team led by the affable Dr Harry K\u00f6nig. An expert medic with a strong naturopathic focus, (his mother is a naturopath), he is very easy to talk to, funny and engaging and will ease your worries and devise a no-nonsense plan to get you back shipshape. He is not a fan of punitive diets, preferring instead a sensible and sustained approach to nutrition and good eating. He will, along with his team, give you a full-body MOT - testing your heart, the viscosity of your blood, your liver functionality and your lung capacity. There is also a brilliant Physiotherapy wing headed by Liliane Goschy who will sort all those niggling back issues which you can never seem to shift. There is a stellar team of masseuses too, with Othman our personal favourite. The fitness team are also top of their game, and if you want a bit of pampering then there are dreamy facials and treatments from Augustinus Bader, Skinceuticals and the organic high quality brand Aqua Organic.
