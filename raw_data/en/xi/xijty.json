Vitamin A deficiency causes imbalance of T helper 17 (Th17) and regulatory T cell (Treg),deteriorating the progression of SLE. Aim To determine the relationship between vitamin A levels and Th17 and Treg level inpatients with SLE and its relation to disease activity. Patients and methods A total of 45 female patients with SLE diagnosed according to the American Collegeof Rheumatology criteria and 45 healthy age-matched and sex-matched patients as control group were included. Full assessment was done including medications, clinical examination (pain evaluation by visual analogue scale and assessment ofdisease activity by SLE disease activity index), laboratory investigations, andalbumin -creatinine ratio. Serum levels of vitamin A were measured by a human KAMIYA kits, and flow cytometry was used for measuring Th17 and Tregpercentages.Results There was a significant deficiency of vitamin A level in patients with SLE compared with controls ( P=0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between vitamin A and Th17 ( P=0.001) and positive correlation between vitamin A and Treg percentages ( P=0.001). There was a negative correlation between vitamin A levels and albumin -creatinine ratio in patients with SLE ( R=0.255). A positive correlation between serum levels of vitamin A and C3 and C4 was found ( P=0.001). Conclusion Vitamin A deficiency is a bad prognostic factor in patients with SLE, affecting Th17/ Treg balance. Routine use of retinoic acid may be a promising supplementary agentin patients with SLE, improving its prognosis. Keywords: systemic lupus Th17/Treg balance, vitamin for Rheumatology and Rehabilitation 1110-161X Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease in which activation of the innate immune system with activation of T and Blymphocytes and autoantibodies production, immunecomplex deposition, and complement-induced tissue damage occurs. It is characterized with relapsing- remitting course, which occurs at any age, but it haspoorer outcome in childhood than adult patients. Itsmanifestations vary from mild muco-cutaneous tosevere life-threatening illness [1]. Pathogenesis of SLE is still unclear, but balance between T helper 17 (Th17) and regulatory T cells(Tregs) underlies the outcome of the disease [2]. The Tregs, a subset of CD4+T cells, are the main regulators of immune response and suppress inflammatory T-cellresponses. Th17, a newly discovered subset of CD4+ Tcells, is identified according to its ability to produceinterleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22. It has been shown that there is a positive correlation between the number of Th17 and organ damage, whereas there is anegative correlation between Treg and flares in patientswith SLE. Thus, the balance between the two cells can be a new therapeutic option in patients with SLE [3]. The cytokines produced by the activated immune system in patients with SLE also suppress thegeneration of natural Treg cells and promote a proinflammatory T-cell response dominated by Th17 cells [4].

So the use of vitamin A and retinoic acid may be a promising supplementary agent regulating the balanceof Th17 and Treg [5]. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between vitamin A levels and Th17 and Tregpopulations in patients with SLE and its relation todisease activity. Patients and methods This hospital-based case -control study was conducted on 45 female patients with SLE recruited from the outpatient clinic of Rheumatology, Physical Medicine andRehabilitation departme nt, Menoufia University, between August 2017 and October 2018. All patients fulfilled at least four criteria of the updated American College of Rheumatologycriteria [6] with age between 23 and 55 years,presented with active disease, characterized bysystemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index ( S L E D A I )s c o r em o r et h a n3[ 7 ]a n dd i dn o tt a k e vitamin A supplementation. Moreover, 45 healthyage-matched and sex-matched controls and who didnot take vitamin A supplementation were recruited. Patients with severe infection or immunodeficiency, patients with features of vitamin A deficiency, andpatients with thyroid abnormalities, chronic liver, orrenal disease were excl uded from this study. The ethical committee guidelines in MenoufiaUniversity were followed, and informed consent wastaken from each patient of the study. Full history taking; general examination; local joint examination, with pain evaluation using visual analogue scale [8];and laboratory investigations, including completeblood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, renalfunction (serum and C3 and C4 were done. SLEDAI was used to assess the disease activity [7]. Measurement ofthe serum vitamin A level was done using the vitamin Ahuman KAMIYA biomedical company kits, and flowcytometry also was done for measuring Th17 and Tregpercentages [9]. Overall, 15 ml of blood sample was collected from each individual under aseptic conditions. It wasdivided into three parts: (a) 8 ml was added to EDTA-contained sterile tubes for the determination of complete blood count and CDmarkers;(b) 5.4 ml was added to sterile plain tubesfor assessment of vitamin A level, C-reactive protein, and serum creatinine; and (c) 1.6 ml of blood was delivered into a tube containing 0.4 ml trisodiumcitrate for erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The concentrations of serum vitamin A were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassaytechnique that measures human vitamin A was used.Standards and samples were sandwiched by the immobilized antibody and biotinylated polyclonal antibody specific for vitamin A, which wasrecognized by a streptavidin -peroxidase conjugate. All unbound material was then washed away, and a peroxidase enzyme substrate was added. The color development was stopped, and the intensity of thecolor was measured [10]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 8 ml of whole blood samples. Blood was mixed with anequal volume of PBS (pH: 7.4), layered on Ficollreagent (1077 g/ml), and centrifuged at 1800 gfor 20 min. The buffy coat containing mononuclear cells was recovered, mixed with 20 ml PBS, and centrifuged at 3000 gfor 10 min, and then the supernatant was discarded. Washed cells wereincubated with labeled monoclonal antibody which binds to cells expressing the antibody of interest and then the cells expressing monoclonal werefluorescently stained. For each sample, three tubes were prepared, one for the unstained sample (auto control), and 100 ml ofperipheral blood mononuclear cells at 5\u00d710 5/tube WAS stained in two tubes: PE- anti-CD4 plus anti-CD25 FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and the other with PE-anti-CD4for 30 min. Then in both tubes, cells were fixedfollowed by intracellular staining with PerCP-anti-FoxP3 in first tube and anti-IL17 FITC in the second tube. After incubation for 30 min at 4 \u00b0Ca n d subsequently washing twice with PBS, the cells were suspended in 300 l of PBS for final flowVitamin A deficiency and T helper17, regulatory T cells and their relation to SLE disease activity Fettouh et al. 245cytometry analysis. The percentages of Treg (CD4 +CD25+FoxP3+) and T helper 17 (CD4+ anti-IL17+) cells in all samples were determined by flowcytometry, using FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Immune Cytometry System, San Jose, California, USA). Statistical analysis Data were described as mean\u00b1SD. SPSS version 17.0(IBM Corporation, Chicago, USA) for Windows wasused for statistical analysis and generation of graphs. t- Test and Pearson correlation were used [11].Results A total of 45 female patients with SLE with a mean age of 36.6 years (range: 23 -55) and 45 healthy age- matched and sex-matched controls with a mean ageof 34.36 years were included in this study (Fig. 1). Hypovitaminosis A was considered if up to 30 mcg/dl. It was observed in 35 patients with SLE (77.77%) andwas normal in all the control group. Vitamin A levels in the patients with SLE were significantly lower compared with controls ( P=0.001; Table 1). Figure 2 Shows age and vitamin A level among patients with SLE and control.

There were statistically significant differences between patients with SLE with hypovitaminosis A comparedwith those with normal vitamin A 4). Discussion SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disease that causes persistent inflammation and multiple organ damage.SLE is initiated by imbalance of Th17 and Tregpopulations [2]. Recent studies showed that increase number of Th17 and reduction of Treg were strongly associated with organ damage and clinical symptoms ofSLE [12]. Vitamin A has a major role in immune systemregulation especially Th17 and Treg balance [5]. This study showed a significant increase for the incidence of hypovitaminosis A in patients withSLE compared with healthy controls ( P=0.001). This comes in agreement with Kida et al. [13] who reported decreased vitamin A levels in patients withSLE. This significant low level of vitamin A isexplained by the chronic inflammatory conditions,which decrease the expression of the lecithin retinol acyltransferase enzyme causing disruption of vitamin A storage in the liver. D'Ambrosio et al.[14] also reported low levels of vitamin A in patients with SLE compared with healthy controls. They explainedthat bytheinterference oflecithinretinolacetyl-transferees gene, which may be associated withvitamin A deficiency. This study showed that the patients with low vitamin A levels have higher disease activity (SLEDAI). Thiscomes in agreement with Hanly et al. [15] as theyreported high disease activity in vitamin A-deficientpatients as compared with those with normal vitamin Alevels due to immuno-regulatory imbalance whichcaused by vitamin A deficiency. This study reported the association between vitamin A deficiency and high titer of Th17, albumin creatinineratio, and anti-dsDNA titer ( titer ofTreg, C3, and C4 ( P=0.001). In accordance to our study, Elias and his colleagues reported the significant po sitive correlation between vitamin A and Treg and negative correlation between vitamin A and Th17. This is owing tothe ability of ATRA and other agonists of theretinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR )t oi n h i b i t the formation of Th17 cells and promote Tregdifferentiation [16]. Our results also come in agreement with Nolting et al. [17] and Sobel et al. [18] who reported the significant positive correlation between Treg and vitamin A levels and the negative correlation between it and Th17.They reported that vitamin A can enhance the conversion of naive T cells into Treg and also inhibit Th17 differentiation by inhibiting IL-6 andIL-23 receptor expression. The negative correlation between serum vitamin A levels and albumin -creatinine ratio in patients with SLE ( P=0.091, R=0.255) was supported by Bennet et al. [19] who reported the high levels of albumin -creatinine ratio when vitamin A decreases. A significant negative correlation between vitamin Alevels and anti-dsDNA titer was reported in our study,which is reported also by Hanly et al. [15].Table 3 Correlation of vitamin A levels with T helper 17 and regulatory T cell percentages and C3, C4, anti-double stranded DNA titer and albumin- creatinine ratio in patients with systemic lupus Vitamin cell.Table 4 Comparison between patients with SLE with hypovitaminosis A with those with normal vitamin A level regarding C3, C4, regulatory T cell 17, T helper 17, anti-double stranded DNA titer, and albumin- creatinine ratio Patientswith low cell.248 Egyptian & Rehabilitation , Vol. 46 No. 4, October-December 2019The significant positive correlation between vitamin A deficiency and low levels of C3 and C4 in patients withhigh disease activity in our study was supported byHanly et al. [15], who reported the association between vitamin A- deficiency and complement consumptionand low complement levels in SLE patients with highdisease activity. Our study reported a significant increase in Th17 and decrease in Treg in patients with SLE with low vitaminA levels compared with those with normal vitamin Alevels ( P=0.001). This comes in agreement with Pan et al. [12]. Szmyrka-Kaczmarek et al. [2] reported high Th17 and low Treg levels in vitamin A-deficient SLE patientscompared to those with normal vitamin A level. Low level of Treg caused increase autoantibodies productions, tissue damages, and clinicaldeteriorations in patients with SLE. In contrast, Yang et al. [20] reported the elevation of both Th17 and Treg populations in patients with SLE. The increased Treg may be a compensatory mechanismto autoimmune processes, such as increase Th17 subset. In this study, we excluded patients with immunodeficiency or those associated with otherautoimmune disorders, and our patient groups werelarger. This study also reported significant decreased of C3 and C4 level in vitamin A-deficient patients comparedwith those with normal levels ( P=0.001). This is owing to high disease activity in vitamin A- deficient patients and more complement activation causing decreased C3 and C4. Szmyrka-Kaczmareket al. [2] reported this decrease in C3 and C4 in patients with active SLE. In vitamin A-deficient patients, the albumin -creatinine ratio (>30 mg albumin/creatinine) and anti-dsDNA titer were high than patients with normal levels. This proves the severity of organ damage especially the kidneys in vitamin A-deficient patients with SLEowing to immune disruption, autoantibodiesproduction, and immune complex deposition. Bennet et al. [19] reported the same results. Conclusion Vitamin A deficiency is a bad prognostic factor in patients with SLE, affecting Th17/Treg balance, as it can inhibit Th17 differentiation and enhance Tregdifferentiation. Treatment with vitamin A is apromising supplementary option and may provideimprovement in SLE prognosis. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.
