Holcomb, Governor State House 206 Indianapolis, IN 46204 Dear Governor Holcomb: It is said that Benjamin Franklin uttered the timeless phrase \" An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure \" in 1736. In that context , he was speaking about preventing deadly fires. More than 285 years later, this wisdom still rings true and applies to our most precious resource: health. Your Commission on Public Health submits this report as required by Executive Order 21-21, which you issued August 18, 2021. The Commission concluded its final meeting on June 30, 2022 , and adopted this report and its findings with instructions to the Indiana Department of Health staff to submit it on behalf of the Commission. The Commission first met in September 2021 and met monthly thereafter to study the challenges and successes of our public health system. It came as no surprise to learn that Indiana has some of the most dedicated professionals at the state and local levels who are committed to promoting, protecting, and improving our health and safety. We owe it to this group of professionals to build on their successes and prepare Indiana for the future. It is clear that the COVID -19 pandemic tested our public health system in a way that we have not seen since the 191 8 influenza pandemic. Your administration and the public health system rose to the challenge time and again. For that, this Commission commends you, the Indiana Department of Health, Indiana Department of Homeland Security, Indiana National Guard, local health departments, and the myriad partners across Indiana who helped throughout the response. The COVID -19 pandemic also highlighted the diversity of thought and opinions that exist within our state , especially with respect to how best to deliver services and the desire 3 for local control. Throughout our analysis and discussion, we have sought to take a balanced approach that takes this into account and propose tailored solutions to fit Indiana's needs for a modern public health system. You will find several themes reiterated throughout this report. It became apparent to us as we dove deeper into this work that funding, governance structure, and workforce would be at the heart of many of the challenges of our public health system . That is why we focused on those three workstreams first and continued to study them through various perspectives. This report is laid out such that the Executive Summary and Background contain essential information about our process and our recommendations. The chapters that follow are aligned to the workstreams we analyzed and go into more depth about our findings. We surveyed the members of the Commission and asked them why they said yes to the call to serve. We heard two things consistently: public healt h investment undergirds vibrant communities , and average performance is not the Hoosier way. Communities thrive when they have sufficient resources devoted to public health and citizens reach their optimal health. Our rankings to date have been poor to average, and that simply does not reflect our goal of excellence for Indiana's wellbeing. Thus, it is imperative that we make critical changes to the public health system so that we can help build the communities of the futur e. Our ounces of prevention t oday will reap pounds of reward in the years to come. On behalf of the entire Commission, t hank you for the opportunity to serve. The work we accomplish here will cement Indiana's future as a n economic leader . We remain committed to assisting in any way we can.

The work of the Governor 's Public Health Commission was made possible in part by a grant from the Richard M. Fairbanks Foundation. No portion of that grant was u sed for the p urposes of lobbying. Executive Summary and Background 6 Executive Summary Good health is essential for communities, families, and individuals to thrive; children to learn; adults to maintain employment; and individuals, businesses, and healthcare payors to devote less of their limited resources to the soaring costs of healthcare . While access to care to treat an illness or a disabling condition is crucial to good health, other factors play a larger role in our health outcomes. Research shows that the biggest impacts to our health and wellbeing are outside of the physician's off ice - they are our behaviors and the environments in which we live and work. The importance of healthy environments and sound health education has never been greater. These factors are the primary domains of the public health system. In fact, most of the life expectancy gains achieved during the 20th century - approximately 25 of 30 additional years - are attributable to public health programs and interventions focused on preventing people from getting sick or injured in the first place and on promotin g wellness by encouraging healthy behaviors. The longevity gains of the last century, however, are threatened by contemporary public health challenges and the prominence of non -communicable diseases, especially: Rising deaths from drugs, alcohol, and s uicide Rising rates of adult and child obesity Persistently high rates of adult tobacco use and teen vaping Continuing risks from drug -resistant disease agents and infectious diseases such as measles, hepatitis, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, COVID -19, and others - each with the potential to spread rapidly across the state, across the country, and around the world. In fact, life expectancy in Indiana has been declining since 2010 , when it peaked at 77.5 years. Indiana's life expectancy in 201 9 was 77 years , almost two years below the U .S. average of 78.8, placing us 40th in the nation.1 Of even greater concern is that difference between the Indiana county with the highest life expectancy and the county with the lowest life expectancy is almost nine years . This is clear evidence of the health disparities that exist across our state. Executive Summary and Background 7 While Indiana fares well on other quality -of-life measures, such as our cost of living and K-12 education system, the state persistently ranks among the bottom 20 states, and often the bottom 10, on key public health metrics. The costs to our state from our poor health are substantial, including unnecessary suffering, lost productivity, and weaker communities. Even before the COVID -19 pandemic, it was clear that Indiana's public health system was struggling to meet our public health challenges. Funding and the ability to deliver the essential public health services equitably across our state are largely dependent on where a Hoosier lives. Indiana statutes place responsibility for funding local health departments on the county or municipal jurisdiction, wher e it occupies a low priority and competes for finite resources. The pandemic further exposed the system's deficiencies, as well as the geographic, racial, ethnic, and socio -economic disparities in health outcomes that exist across the state. We can and we must do better to meet the public health challenges that already exist and to be prepared for the new challenges that will emerge in the future. The Governor's Public Health Commission believes Indiana must take action to transform the state's public he alth system by modernizing our public health services, administrative and data supports, and delivery systems concurrent with the long -overdue investments that will strengthen our public health workforce to ensure that the state is prepared for future publ ic health emergencies. This report summarizes the Commission's findings and recommendations in response to its charge in six subject -matter areas related to public health: (1) governance, infrastructure, and services; (2) public health funding; (3) workfor ce; (4) data and information integration; (5) emergency preparedness; and (6) child and adolescent health. Upon submission of this report to the Governor, Executive Order 21 -21 requires the Commission to sunset. This work, however, does not end there. The Indiana Department of Health , under direction of the Office of the Governor, will take ownership of implementation of his agenda to advance Indiana's public health system. This implementation work will continue to require multi -sector partnerships to implement, evaluate, and adapt these recommendations to fit the needs of Hoosiers for decades to come. Additional advisory groups may be convened and metrics developed beyond those discussed in this report to further measure system improvement. Executive Summary and Background 8 Commissioners ' Remarks on the Importance of this Work \"Regarding public health, I'm not satisfied with adequate nor average; we need a foundational commitment that all Hoosiers have excellent public health services in every ZIP code through out Indiana.\" Mark Bardsley, Grant County Commissioner \"Public health is critical to addressing people and communities as a whole and closing the inequality gap .\" Dr. Cara Veale, Indiana Rural Health Association \"As a rural general surgeon and county health officer, I have seen first -hand some of the gaps in public health service delivery. These last two years, the COVID -19 pandemic has magnified the problems of the delivery of public health services in Indiana. This has especially affected rural communities .\" Dr. David Welsh, Ripley County Local Health Officer \"I've dedicated my entire career to bettering the public health delivery system in our area and working toward a more collaborative and sustainable collective workforce across the state. Over the past two years, public health had a light shined upon it across the nation. For Indiana, that light showed us that we have some work to do in order to provide worthwhile public health servic es to every single Indiana resident in a consistent and meaningful way. The work of the Commission is certain to lead to better public health service delivery for every Hoosier as we build a more well -trained, supported, and robust system poised to provid e proactive and preventive services .\" Mindy Waldron , Allen County Health Administrator \"Indiana's health workforce is the foundation of the public health system. The Governor's Public Health Commission has prioritized workforce discussions and recognize s the need for formal planning. Knowing and understanding the workforce involved in the delivery of public health services is critical for future planning. \" Dr. Hannah Maxey, I ndiana University Bowen Center for Workforce Policy and Research \"Health and the economy are inextricably linked. Indiana is a state that works, and a healthier workforce is a more productive workforce.\" Dr. Judy Monroe, Co -Chair Executive Summary and Background 9 \"Public health is what we do collectively to protect and improve the health of our community - it is not only preventive health care for people who can't afford care, but also what we do as a community to help everyone live longer and have a better quality of life. In Indiana , we don't have an effective public health system ; rather we have a collection of public health departments variably funded primarily by the counties without strong statewide standards or direction. We need a modern public health syste m in Indiana that focuses on creating the conditions where we live longer and more productive lives. \" Dr. Paul Halverson, Indiana University Fairbanks School of Public Health \"The COVID -19 pandemic strained hospitals and public health agencies in unimaginable ways. But through the adversity, closer partnerships were developed that gave us models of how we should transform the system. We are all in this work together, and everyo ne agrees we can't keep doing public health the way we have in the past. \" Brian Tabor, Indiana Hospital Association \"Public health professionals and medical care professionals need to work together for the public good. The Commission's plan needs to outline reasons and solutions for public health and medical care to come together for the health of each community. Financing for public health needs to be elevated to a higher priority in each Indiana county. Our plan emphasize s financing as a critical part of our recommendations. \" Dennis Dawes, Hendricks County Commissioner \"Our opportunity for health begins long before we are sick - in our homes, at school and work, and in our neighborhoods and communities. It requires the power of pr evention and fair opportunities for all people, regardless of age, race, ability, or income. Our public health system is the foundation of this 'power of prevention,' and it requires funding, infrastructure, capacity, and expertise on par with the clinical systems that treat injury and illness once they occur. \" Kim Irwin , Indiana Public Health Association \"Indiana ranks very favorably in economics, opportunity, education, and public safety. However, our public health metrics rank us amongst the lowest in the nation. Business and industry require a health y workforce for our Indiana economy to continue to grow.\" Luke Kenley, Co -Chair Executive Summary and Background 10 \"The Commission was formed with voices from across a broad spectrum of representatives , and the strategy has create d greater engagement that will produce intentional outcomes and a healthier state. A healthier state starts with recognizing that a greater investment is needed if we are to grow and prosper. Our data -driven approach has led u s to solutions that can be implemented to improve public health. \" Bob Courtney, City of Madison Mayor \"Public health is a vital safety net component for safeguarding and improving the health of disadvantaged populations and communities of color . The common -sense proposed reforms, arrived at by the consensus of the GPHC, provide an important vehicle for serious consideration by the legislature. Indiana's future success ultimately will be determined by whether the Commission's recommendations are enact ed.\" Carl Ellison, Indiana Minority Health Coalition \"Citizens expect the Commission to assure Indiana is better prepared for the next pandemic or crisis. However, citizens also want the Commission to listen to their concerns regarding finding the bala nce between too much government intervention and individual responsibility. We, as a state, cannot become complacent and fail to address what went wrong during the pandemic, due in large part to extreme underfunding of our public health system in the stat e of Indiana. It will hold us back as a state when it comes to attracting and retaining people, especially young people. \" Susan Brooks, Citizen Advisor \"Public health plays an integral role in the health of our youngest and most vulnerable Hoosiers, and their health outcomes often serve as broader indicators of the health of the state as a whole. That's why we need to make sure our public health system keeps them at the forefront of policymaking and program delivery.\" Dr. Kristina Box, Secretary and State Health Commissioner \"Local health departments are the backbone of efforts to keep our communities safe. As an infectious disease physician and the local health officer for Marion County , I know first -hand how important it is that Indi ana ensure every health department has the resources it needs to keep people healthy and safe. The GPHC's recommendations will help us protect Hoosiers for generations to come.\" Dr. Virginia Caine , Marion County Local Health Officer Executive Summary and Background 11 Commission, Charge , and Process The Governor's Public Health Commission was established by executive order from Governor Eric J. Holcomb on August 18, 2021 . The Commission was tasked with advising the Office of the Governor and the Indiana Department of Health on the functioning of Indiana's public health system. The Commission was charged with the following: I. Analyzing Indiana's current public health system to identify both strengths and weaknesses ; II. Analyzing the performance of state and local health departments during the COVID -19 pandemic ; III. Identifying: a. ways to improve the delivery of public health services throughout the State b. the funding challenge for th e State's public health system and ways to address those challenges ; c. ways to promote health equity ; d. ways to ensure the sustainability of our local health departments; and , e. ways to improve responses to future public health emergencies ; IV. Identifying legisla tive proposals to address the Commission's findings and recommendations; and , V. Issuing a written report of the Commission's findings and recommendations . Commission Proceedings Commission meetings were held monthly from September 2021 through July 2022. Except for one virtual meeting held in January 2022, all proceedings were held in person at the Indiana Government Center and State Library. Each meeting was live -streamed and archived online. The 1 5 Commission members and citizen advisor , all appointed by Governor Holcomb , include representatives from public health entities, local government, the Indiana Minority Health Coalition , and healthcare associations. Executive Summary and Background 12 Commission Workstreams The Commission's work was driven through the following six workstreams led by Designated Policy Advisors who conducted research, engage d experts and stakeholders , and developed draft recommendations for the Commission's consideration. Workstream Purpose Emergency Preparedness Analyze the State and local health departments' response to the COVID -19 pandemic ; make recommendations for future improvements Public Health Funding Review public health funding sources, current levels, and suggestions for standardiz ation Governance , Infrastructure , and Services Review public health governance and infrastructure , public health services delivered through LHDs , and shared services models Workforce Consider policies to support public health workforce planning and to identify and address workforce shortages Data and Information Integration Consider policies to improve the use and integration of public health data to better support public health programming and delivery Child and Adolescent Health Review opportunities to improve school -based health education, prevention, and wellness activities and improve access to child and adolescent health care Other Public Input The Governor's Public Health Commission actively sought other stakeholder i nput and public comment through multiple modes. This included : Maintaining a public website (www.in.gov/gphc ) with a form for submitting public comments Holding seven \"Listening Tour\" public meetings at geographically diverse locations across the state in February and March 2022 (Gary, Huntington, Jasper, Monticello, New Castle, Plainfield, and Seymour ) Conducting more than 30 stakeholder meetings , led by the State Health Commissioner and a Commission Co -Chair, from September 2021 through May 2022 Executive Summary and Background 13 More than 480 c omments received from the public comment website were summarized and presented at each Commission meeting. Themes from the Listening Tour meetings were also synthesized and shared with Commission members for review. Updates to the IDOH staff were provided during regular agency meetings , and staff were encouraged to share information with their respec tive stakeholders. An internal \"listening tour\" was held April 08, 2022, to solicit feedback from IDOH staff. The Commission recognizes the generous support of the Richard M. Fairbanks Foundation, which helped make this wo rk possible through a grant of $250,000. Executive Summary and Background 14 Introduction Good health is essential for communities , families, and individuals to thrive. Research shows that individuals who are healthier are generally happier than their peers who are in poor health2, and better health also enables better workplace attendance and community engagement. State policymakers have an opportunity through their professional service to support policies that help indiv iduals and families thrive . Improved physical health also benefits Indiana's fiscal health by reducing missed workdays due to poor health, lowering healthcare costs, improving productivity, and making the state an attractive place for businesses to locate . A key strategy for achieving healthy outcomes in our state is having in place policies that help sustain the health of individuals and families - not just in their own households, but across the community. Successful public health policies employ a com munity - wide perspective to help improve the health of individuals and families in communities across our great state . At the core of Indiana's public health system is a network of Hoosiers with strong professional experience who use insights from science and data about dynamics within our state to help protect and improve the health of individuals and their communities. Their public health work is accomplished by promot ing healthier lifestyles, understanding disease and injury prevention , and preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious diseases in our state. In contrast to physicians , nurses , and other clinicians who often care for individuals who become sick or injured, Indiana's public health professionals try to prevent problems from happening at a community level by working with state and local partners, implementing educational programs, recommending policies, and conducting research. In many of the public policy discussions about the cost of health care in Indiana for individuals, families, businesses, and our state, too often, conversations seem to focus on expensive medical care and fixing or curing a condition that could have been prevented in the first place. While that is a necessary public policy focus, Indiana would benefit from greater attention on promoting healthy behaviors that can improve health outcomes for individuals, communities, and the state as a whole . Indiana's Life Expectancy is Declining After peaking at 77.5 years in 2010, Indiana's life expectancy declined to 77 years in 2019, nearly two years below the national average of 78.8 years, placing Indiana 40th nationally on this metric. Executive Summary and Background 15 This report outlines concrete, actio nable steps that Indiana can take to help improve the health of its citizens. The report's findings are a call to state leaders to implement proven, effective measures to help individuals and families across the state live their healthiest, safest, most pr oductive lives. The historical data show state and local public health actions that over the past decades have cumulatively effectuated an estimated 25 additional years of life expectancy. This tremendous success in public health in our state was accomplished by focusing on preventing people from getting sick or injured in the first place, while also promoting wellness through healthy behaviors and personal responsibility .3[i] Chronic underfunding and fragmentation of the public health system are now reducing those life expectancy gains. Ten Great U.S. Public Health Achievements, 1900 -1999 Vaccination: For smallpox, polio, measles, and other infectious diseases Motor -vehicle safety: Safer vehicles and roads; less drunk driving; and seatbelt and child safety seat requirements Safer workplaces: Fewer injuries and deaths on the job Infectious diseases control: By ensuring clean water and improving sanitation Fewer coronary heart disease and stroke deaths: From smoking cessation efforts, blood pressure control, early detection , and treatment Safer and healthier foods: With less microbial contamination and more nutritional value Healthier mothers and babies: From hygiene and nutrition, antibiotics, greater access to health care , and other advances Family planning: Leading to fewer infant, child , and maternal deaths Fluoridation of drinking water: Preventing tooth decay in adults and children Tobacco health warnings: Preventing millions of smoke -related deaths Despite these advancements, too many Hoosiers still die prematurely. In fact, the disparity in life expectancy between Indiana counties can be stark - the county with the highest life expectancy has nine more years on average than the county with the lowest life expectancy. This is further exacerbated by the fact that this reduced life expectancy is affecting working -age Hoosiers (ages 25 -64).4 Virtually no family or community is untouched by the scourge of death of a loved one or friend due to substance use disorder (drugs , alcohol, opioids), or suicide Executive Summary and Background 16 Too many of our young people are losing their health and vitality due to increases in teen vaping , which cause s permanent lung damage Many of even our youngest children are experiencing health problems because they are inactive and are considered clinically obese We all know too many adults who are obese and/or use tobacco consistently At the same time, we know that state borders do not protect us from viruses and infectious diseases. In the 21 st century, the outbreak of a n infectious disease within our state can occur as the result of a chain of events that ends with just a handshake, a cough, or a sneeze. Our local hospitals and healthcare providers are continuously fighting drug -resistant microbes and the threat of infectious diseases like measles, hepatitis, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, COVID -19, and other diseases. Hoosiers can take pride in the fact that Indiana ranks near the top of the nation compared to other states in many quality -of-life measur es, such as our cost of living and pre -K- 12 education system . Our business economic system and tax system are both rated in the top 10 states. In many respects, Indiana is a national leader in providing an affordable place to raise a family, grow a busine ss, educate the next generation , and promote opportunities for all. However, when Indiana's record on health and wellness is compared to the same measures from other states, our outcomes are not as favorable . (Table 1)5 Table 1: 2021 US News and World Report \"Best States\" Rankings Other Quality of Life Metrics IN State Ranking Public Health Metrics IN State Ranking Affordabilitya 6 Mental Health 35 Opportunityb 7 Infant Mortality 38 Pre-K through Grade 12 Education 9 Early Adult Mortality 41 Growthc 19 Obesity 40 Public Safety 25 Smoking 41 Natural Environmentd 48 Suicide 13 Indiana 's Overall State Ranking: 32 Indiana's Overall Public Health Ranking: 40 a Measures cost of living and housing affordability. b Measures poverty, housing affordability , and equality for women, minorities, and people with disabilities. c Measures growth of the young population, growth through migration, and the GDP growth rate. d Measures air and water quality and p ollution. Executive Summary and Background 17 These lower rankings are not just numbers on paper; the realities they convey result in extra costs for individuals, families, businesses, and state government as well. In fact, the costs to Indiana from poor health are substantial. For example : Obesity and diabetes account for more than $8.4 billion in productivity losses among employed individuals in Indiana6 Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, lung disease, stroke, diabetes , and kidney disease , are among the leading causes of dea th and disability in Indiana with total direct and indirect costs of $75.5 billion per year7 Smoking results in nearly $3 billion in annual healthcare costs for Indiana, including $590 million in Medicaid costs alone8 Cervical cancer accounts for more th an $54 million in estimated direct healthcare costs per year9 Before the COVID -19 pandemic, it was clear that Indiana's public health system needed to be modernized and strengthened to meet the current public health challenges our state faces. The state's poor health rankings and aging public health infrastructure are not new concerns , as shown by the graph shown to the right . In 1991, America's Health Ran kings placed Indiana 26th in the nation for overall health outcomes . The trend has been downward since that time , with Indiana ranking 41st in 2019 , which was the last time they ranked the states like this due to the disruption caused by the COVID - 19 pand emic . The COVID -19 pandemic further exposed the gaps in our public health system's ability to predict and respond to the needs of our state and local communities in a timely, targeted, efficient manner. The disruption and problems caused by the pandemic a lso laid bare long - standing disparities in our state based on where an individual may live, his or her race, and what Executive Summary and Background 18 level of socio -economic status he or she may have attained. State leaders have a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable and ensure that our state's policies treat individuals with fairness so individuals have equal opportunities regardless of geographic, racial, or socio -economic factors. To accomplish this, we must confront the public health challenges that exist and lay the groundwo rk to be better prepared for future challenges that will emerge. The Governor's Public Health Commission was created in 2021 to study Indiana's public health system and has been led since then by Hoosiers who have deep expertise and long records of service in the public and private sectors . The Commission has conducted a careful study and methodical review of Indiana 's public health system practices, policies, and precedents over the past many months. This report summarizes the Commission's findings and recommendations in response to its charge in six subject matter areas related to public health : 1) governance , infrastructure, and services, 2) public health funding, 3) workforce, 4) data and information integration, 5) emergency preparedness, and 6) child and adolescent health. This report presents a distilled set of recommendations that seek to remedy numerous gaps and identified problems and represents an opportunity to take action to transform Indiana's public health system into one that can be a model for the nation. This vision can be accompli shed by making cost -effective investments in proven approaches to strengthen our public health workforce , as well as to modernize our public health services, administrative and data supports, and delivery system. Taking these steps will help ensure the sta te is prepared for future public health emergencies and that every Hoosier has the opportunity to achieve their optimal health .

Governance, Infrastructure , and Services Findings 31 Governance , Infrastructure , and Services Findings Under the U.S. Constitution's 10 th Amendment, which gives states all powers not specifically given to the federal government, state and local health departments retain the primary responsibility for public health. Indiana's public health system, comprised of the Indiana Department of Health (IDOH) and 94 local health departments (LHDs), operates under a decentralized , \"home rule\" model , in which local governments retain substantial statutory autonomy to mana ge public health services and functions, including the structure, financing, size, and activities of LHDs. Examples of other governance classifications can be found in Appendix A. Indiana Department of Health (IDOH) : Indiana's Primary State Public Health Authority The IDOH is an executive branch agency led by the State Health Commissioner , who is appointed by the Governor and is required by statute to be a physician in good standing with an unrestricted license to practice medicine. The IDOH has fou r operating commissions: The HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMISSION focuses on primary and secondary prevention strategies through nine divisions: Chronic Disease, Primary Care & Rural Health; Nutrition & Physical Activity; Women's Health; Maternal & Child Health; Children's Special Health Care Services; Trauma & Injury Prevention; Women, Infants, & Children (WIC); Fatality Review & Prevention; and the Center for Deaf & Hard of Hearing Education. The CONSUMER SERVICES AND HEALTHCARE REGULATION COMMISSION licenses and/or certifies over 9,000 acute and long -term care facilities to operate and receive Medicare and Medicaid funding. The Commission also licenses more than 15,000 radiology professionals, certifies over 50,000 nurse aides and home health aides, and operates the Division of Weights, Measures and Radiology. The PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION COMMISSION works to reduce the public risk of exposure to communicable diseases, foodborne illnesses, and environmental health and safety hazards, prepares for and respo nds to public health threats, and operates the Division of Vital Records. The LABORATORY SERVICES COMMISSION includes the IDOH Laboratory that provides critical direct services in the form of environmental and food testing, communicable disease testing, viral and microbial culturing, and surveillance testing. Governance, Infrastructure , and Services Findings 32 Other IDOH divisions report directly to IDOH executive staff , including Tobacco Preven tion & Cessation, the Office of Minority Health, and Oral Health ( all of which report to the chief medical officer) , and the Epidemiology Resource Center, Office of Public Health Performance Management, and HIV, STD, and Viral Hepatitis and Health Issues a nd Challenges divisions ( all of which report to the deputy state health commissioner and state epidemiologist). Several operational divisions, including the Office of Public Affairs, Office of Legal Affairs, Office of Data Analytics, Office of Technology a nd Cybersecurity, and Office of Finance, report to the chief of staff. An IDOH Organizational Chart is included as Appendix B to this report. In 2021, IDOH was awarded accreditation by the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) , joining the ranks of 3 9 other states that have successfully completed this rigorous, multi -year, peer -reviewed process that ensures that a public health department meets or exceeds specified quality standards and measures. Most Local Health Departments (LHDs) are County -Based Indiana's 92 counties are served by 94 LHDs , including: 89 County -Based LHDs , each operating as an agency of the county government pursuant to IC 16 -20-1-2; one Multiple County LHD serving both Fountain County and Warren County (created under IC 16 -20-3); one county -based LHD serving Marion County organized as a Municipal Corporation under IC 16 -22- 8; and three Municipal LHDs established under IC 16 -20-4 serving the cities of East Chicago, Gary and Fishers. Across the country, the majority of LHDs (61%) serve populations of fewer than 50,000.11 Similarly, most Indiana LHDs serve smaller populations: approximately one -third serve populations of fewer than 25,000 , and two -thirds serv e fewer than 50,000 residents . The majority of LHDs in the state have fewer than 10 total employees, including both part -time and full-time (Table 2). Table 2: Number of LHDs and Average Number of Full and Part Time LHD Employees by Size of Jurisdiction Served12 LHD 2550,000 50100,000 100250,000 >250,000 # Of LHDs 30 35 12 12 5 Ave. # FT 3.2 6.2 14.9 29.9 194.8 Ave. # PT 2.4 2.6 6.0 6.8 17.0 Governance, Infrastructure , and Services Findings 33 County Governance of Local Health Departments The governance structure for most LHDs is illustrated in Figure 1 below. The County Council exercises ultimate decision -making power regarding fiscal affairs , including: approval of the LHD annual budget; establishing LHD staff compensation; fixing tax rates and establishing county property tax levies, including the cou nty health fund levy; and authorizing public fund expenditures. The Board of County Commissioners has a wide range of executive and administrative authority , including appointment of the members of the Local Health Board (LHB), approval of LHD contracts an d certifying the appointment of the Local Health Officer (LHO). The LHB appoints the LHO and oversees the management of the LHD , including passage of local health ordinances and setting fees . LHB appointees may receive a modest per diem for their work but are generally uncompensated for their services. Figure 1: County -Based LHD Governance Structure Governance, Infrastructure , and Services Findings 34 Governance of Multi ple County Local Health Departments (IC 16 -20-3) With IDOH approval, two or more adjacent counties may form a multiple -county LHD through separate ordinances adopted by the county executive of each participating county. The size and membership of the LHB is determined by agreement of the county executives, but the county executive of each participating county must appoint at least one licensed physician to the LHB. At least seven LHB members must meet the same qu alifications required for county - based LHDs. ( See Appendix C for LHB member qualification criteria .) The appointment of the LHO by the LH B must be certified by the county executive of each participating county, and the county council of each participating county must assess an annual levy to financially support the LHD. Each county council is also required to appropriate sufficient funding f rom its c ounty health fund to pay the county's relative share of the LHD expenses, based on population. Municipal LHD Governance (IC 16 -20-4) Indiana law permits the legis lative body of a second -class city (population between 35,000 and 600,000) to form a municipal LHD, subject to the approval of the city's fiscal body. The municipal LHD is governed by a seven -member LHB appointed by the city executive; three of these membe rs must be licensed physicians , and one must be a licensed veterinarian. The municipal LHB has the same powers and duties as a county -based LHB but also sets the compensation of the municipal LHD's officer and employees. The appointment of the LHO (who must be a licensed physician) by the LHB is subject to the approval of the city legislative body. The city's fiscal body approves the municipal LHD's annual budget and appropriates revenue to cover the LHD's expenses. The Indiana Commission on Local Governme nt Reform 's 2007 report recommended that local public health services be delivered at the county level and municipal functions be transferred.13 Marion County Health and Hospital Corporation - Municipal Corporation under IC 16 - 22-8 Indiana law creates one LHD to operate as a municipal corporation serving the state's most populous county - the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County , or \"HHC .\" As a municipal corporation, HHC has the authority to, in part: sue and be sued; enter into contracts; acquire and dispose of real and personal property; and make and adopt appropriate ordinances and resolutions, including ordinances to establish an annual budget and levy taxes. Indiana law provides for local control, however, through appointment of the HHC's seven governing board members by the Indianapolis Mayor, Marion County Board of Commissioners, and the Indianapolis City -County Council . Governance, Infrastructure , and Services Findings 35 Indiana's De centralized Public Health Governance Model has Both Strengths and Weaknesses According to several local public health and county officials who participated in subject matter expert focus group calls to support the governance and infrastructure work stream, Indiana's decentralized public health governance model has a number of advantages. First and foremost, it ensures that there is a credible and trusted public health resource at the local level. Other advantages cited included: having a local physical publ ic health presence in every county so residents have available access to public health services; a better ability to establish relationships with community stakeholders; and better and more timely responsiveness to local needs. The participants, however, a lso cited several disadvantages. One commonly cited disadvantage was that county councils, which control LHD budgets and spending authority, often lack a sufficient understanding of public health. Other disadvantages cited are listed in Table 3 below . Table 3: Strengths and Weaknesses of Indiana's Decentralized Governance Model Advantages Disadvantages Local credibility, trusted resource Local physical presence Established relationships with community stakeholders Able to be more responsive to local public health needs Potentially quicker response time County councils often lack understanding of public health Inconsistent availability of resources, expertise, and training Inconsistent enforcement and messaging Less ability to respond to emerging or growing needs, e.g., growth in refugee or homeless populations Public Health Services Provided Vary by LHDs LHDs across the state vary in the services they offer and the public health functions they perform. While Indiana law and regulation s define a wide range of functions and services, some are mandatory for LHDs to perform or provide , while others are non -mandatory . (See Appendix D: Indiana Local Health Department Duties and Requirements by Indiana Code and Indiana Administrative Code and Figure 2 below ). Governance, Infrastructure , and Services Findings 36 Figure 2: Mandatory and Non -Mandatory LHD Functions and Services Mandatory Vital Records services Food protection/ inspections Safe/sanitary lodging facility bedding Disease control/ infectious disease surveillance Antitoxins/vaccines (diphtheria, scarlet fever, tetanus, and rabies) Childhood lead (reporting, monitoring, case management, prevention) Child fatality review teams Waste/sewage disposal - monitoring and regulation Reporting spills/overflows from undergrou nd storage tanks Ensure dwellings safe for human habitation Pest control/vector a batement Public and semi -public pool/spa drain cover compliance (federal re qmt.)

According to a December 2020 report from the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, on average across the 10 public health districts in Indiana, LHDs have implemented about half of 20 recommended public health activities, ranging from a low of 40 percent of recommended activities in District 6 to a high of 67 percent in District 10 (Figu re 3).14 The report further noted that while some LHDs do offer comprehensive capabilities, at least half of the LHDs in every district have \"limited \" capabilities and the majority of LHDs in six of the 10 districts have \"limited \" capabilities. Figure 3: Average Proportion of Recommended Activities Completed by LHDs at District Level (weighted by population)15 When asked to comment on the services and functions that LHDs provide and perform, local public health and county officials participat ing in focus group calls cited vital records services, food protection inspections, and childhood immunizations as areas o f strength for most LHDs. Conversely, these informants identified tattoo and body piercing safety and sanitation, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV (testing, treatment, etc.), and syringe service programs as areas of inconsistency. Some also noted the inc onsistent application of enforcement measures by LHDs across the state. Governance, Infrastructure , and Services Findings 38 Foundational Public Health Services (FPHS) Framework : A New Approach for Defining Minimum Public Health Service Levels The FPHS framework,16 first developed in 2013 through the work of the Public Health Leadership Forum with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , outlines the unique responsibilities of governmental public health and defines a minimum set of foundational capabilities (cross -cutting skills and capacities ) and foundational areas (topic -specific programs) that must be available in every community. The FPHS are based on the idea that where a person lives should not determine the level of public health services available. There is growing interest in states across the country in using the FPHS framework as a tool to transform the governmental public hea lth system , as the FPHS framework : \"Communicates the minimum package of services needed everywhere, focusing on what services need to be delivered, while leaving room for individual communities to decide how to deliver them. Provides a common language that can also be used to inform health department structure or service delivery. Can be assessed to identify the degree to which the FPHS is being achieved, current investments in the FPHS, and the funding needed to fill identified gaps. Can be used as an org anizing tool for strategic planning by identifying the capabilities or programs not being fully implemented and that need additional focus and resources. Connects clearly to national initiatives, such as public health accreditation. \"17 (See Appendix E: Fou ndational Public Health Services Fact Sheet.) Figure 4: Foundational Public Health Services Framework Governance, Infrastructure , and Services Findings 39 Public Health Service Delivery Can Be Improved Through Shared Services Approaches According to researchers, the strongest predictor of a public health agency's ability to provide the 10 Essential Health Services18 is the size of the population served by the agency.19 Agencies with a larger than average staff and higher staff per population served have also been found to perform better.20 Shared services approaches can address the capacity constraints of smaller LHDs by bringing together multiple cities or counties to share resources across their respective boundaries to more efficiently and effectively deliver public health services. An LHD that chooses to enter into a shared service arrangement may pool resources or share staff, expertise or programs to accomplish more than the LHD could accomplish on its own. According to the Center for Sharing Public Health Services, there are four main types of sharing arrangements, as shown in Figure 5 below. Moving from left to right along the spectrum, \"the level of service integration increases, the level of autonomy for the sharing partners decreases, and implementation and governance of sharing agreements may become more complex \": 21 Figure 5: Spectrum of Sharing Arrangements Governance, Infrastructure , and Services Findings 40 Examples of shared services delivery models include mutual aid and interlocal contracts; hub and spoke models; and centers of excellence. For examples of these and other models, see Appendix F: Characteristics and Examples of Servic e Delivery Models Form Washington State . Accreditation Improves the Quality of Public Health Services The Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) serves as the independent accrediting body for state, tribal, local , and territorial health departments. PHAB reports that, as of Nov. 9, 2021, a total of 3 9 states, 289 local, five Tribal, one statewide integrated local public health department system (Florida), and two Army Installation Departments of Public Health have achieved five -year initial accreditation or reaccreditation, bringing the benefits of PHAB accreditation to 89 percent of the U.S. population.22 The IDOH and three LHDs (in Montgomery, Rush, and Vanderburgh counties) have attained PHAB accreditation. PHAB accreditation measures health department performance against a set of nationally recognized, practice -focused, and evidence -based standards. 23 An external evaluation of accredited health departments found that a majority believe that accreditation: Stimulated quality and performance improvement opportunities Improved capacity to provide high quality programs and services Helped health departments use equity as a lens for identifying and addressing health priorities24 Similarly, officials from the thre e accredited LHDs in Indiana reported that becoming accredited: increased their credibility ; enhanced accountability ; made data -driven decisions part of the culture ; facilitated goal setting; s trengthened community partnerships ; and b uilt staff confidence. The only disadvantages noted were the cost and the initial required investment of staff time and resources. Governance, Infrastructure, and Services Findings 41 The governance and infrastructure recommendations and action items that follow address the following overall goals: Ensure consistent delivery of public health services across Indiana Promote collaboration and increased technical assistance Modernize structure of public health Enhance engagement with local community partners and elected officials Encourage sharing of expertise and skilled professionals Promote culture of continuous quality improvement Recommendation 1: Establish baseline service standards for all local health departments.

Public Health Funding Findings 45 Public Health Fundin g Findings Public Health is Chronically Underfunded at All Levels Public health funding in the United States has long been viewed as inadequate. In 2012, the National Academy of Medicine described public health finance as \"a complex and often ad hoc patchwork of fund ing streams with federal, state, local, and private sources that vary widely among communities and exhibit considerable instability .\"25 The Academy also estimated that $24 billion of federal investment would be needed \"to build a governmental public health infrastructure that will be able support the type of population health strategies that are needed to improve the health of Americans and limit the growth of expenditures on medical care services.\"26 Yet the budget for the federal Centers for Disease Contr ol and Prevention (CDC) - the nation's leading public health agency and primary funder of state and local health departments - fell by 2 percent over the following decade, after adjusting for inflation.27 (Figure 6 ) Public health funding levels also vary widely from state to state , with Indiana consistently ranking among the lowest states in per capita expenditures. For example: Pre-pandemic state and CDC spending per person in 2018 -19 averaged $55 in Indiana versus $91 nationally.10 (Figures from 2018 -19 were used to reduce pandemic -related variation.) Figure 6: CDC Program Funding, Adjus ted for inflation, FY2012 -2021 Public Health Funding Findings 46 FY 2020 CDC per capita grant funding to states ranged from $18.11 per person in New Jersey to $209 per person in the District of Columbia , with Indiana ranking 50th, just above New Jersey, at $18.61 per person ( See Appendix G: CDC and HRSA Grant Funding to Indiana ).28 FY 2017 per capita grant funding for selected public health -related programs administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ranged from a high of $114.78 and $59.12 in Alaska and Montana, respectively, to a low of $16.26 and $17.55 in Nevada and Minnesota, respectively, with Indiana ranking 40th at $23.48 per person ( See Appendix G: CDC and HRSA Grant Funding to Indiana ).29 In a recent study using 2018 Census Bureau state expenditure data for 49 of the 50 states (excluding California), Indiana ranked 45th for state government public health expenditures.30 When considering total funding for LHDs (federal, state, and local), the National Association of County & City Health Officials (NACCHO) estimated annual LHD expenditures per capita in 2019 were less than $30 in 17 states, including Indiana, $30 to $50 in 15 states, $50 to $70 in four states, a nd more than $70 in eight states and the District of Columbia. 31 (Figure 7) Most Indiana LHD s Have Per Capita Funding Levels Below the National Average According to a 2020 analysis by the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health (the \"2020 Fairbanks Report\"), total per capita revenues vary widely across Indiana's LHDs , with the vast majority of LHDs well below the NACCHO -reported national median ($41) and 25th percentile ($23). 32 (Figure 8) The 2020 Fairbanks Report notes that per capita s pending ranges from a low of $1.25 in Shelby County to a high of $82.71 in Marion County and that at least 37 counties have local public health per capita spending of less than $10. On the listening tours and through the public comment process, Commission members heard from many respondents about the need for additional financial resources. In particular, we heard the need for flexibility and help navigating the local budget process. Figure 7: Overall Median Annual LHD Expenditures Per Capita, by State, 2019 Public Health Funding Findings 47 Figure 8 : Average Per Capita Local Health Department Revenue (inflation adjusted to 2020 dollars) The Indiana Department of Health 's Funding is Mostly Siloed As shown in Figure 9, IDOH is primarily funded through federal grants (76%) and from the state's Tobacco Master Settlement Fund (12%) , with State General Funds comprising only 3 percent of the FY 2022 budget. Also, $161 million (30%) is non -recurring COVID -19 supplemental funding. In addition to the CDC, other federal grant sources include the Department of Agriculture (Women, Infants, and Children, or \"WIC,\" program), HRSA (e.g., Maternal and Child Health Block G rant, Ryan White HIV/AIDs Program, etc.), the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within HHS (e.g., Hospital Preparedness funding), Department of Homeland Security (bioterrorism preparedness Marion County Health and Hospital Corporation (MCHHC) MCHHC is currently the only county -based LHD organized, by statute, as a municipal corporation. In addition to operating an LHD, MCHHC operates inpatient and outpatient facilities, long term care facilities, and Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services . (EMS). National 25th Percentile $23 National Median $41 Public Health Funding Findings 48 and response funding) and others. Prior to the pandemic, the funding split was approximately 68% federally funds. Much of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's (CDC's) annual funding is granted to states, localities, tribes, and territories. For FY 2020, per -person CDC funding ranged from $18.11 per person in New Jersey to $209 per person in the District of Columbia. Indiana ranked 50th, just above New Jersey, at $18.61 per person. 33 CDC Program Funding to Indiana, FY 2020 Grant Amount Birth Defects, Developmental Disabilities, Disability and Health $264,581 CDC-Wide Activities and Program Support $2,981,039 Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion $8,685,751 Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases $3,097,647 Environmental Health $1,427,630 HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STI and TB Prevention $10,066,808 Immunization and Respiratory Diseases $5,334,991 Injury Prevention and Control $9,883,317 Occupational Safety and Health 732,282 Public Health Preparedness and Response $11,238,343 Public Health Scientific Services (PHSS) $182,756 Vaccines for Children $71,818,947 Total State Funding $125,714,092 Total State Funding, Per Capita $18.61 Total State Funding, Per Capita State Ranking 50th About half of the IDOH funding is passed through or sub -granted to LHDs, WIC providers, health clinics, and other entities. In most cases, this funding is siloed \u2014 tied to specific diseases or other categorical purposes , which inhibit s the ability of LHDs to use the funds to develop and maintain strong foundational capabilities.34 For example, the increased federal funding provided in FYs 2020 - 2022 to address urgent COVID -19 pandemic response needs is Federal 76%Tobacco Master Settlement Public Health Funding Findings 49 generally one -time funding and cannot be used to address long -standing weakne sses in preparedness or disease -prevention programs .35 One source of flexible funding within the IDOH budget is the annual distributions to LHDs from the Local Health Maintenance (LHM) Fund established by IC 16 -46-10. LHM Fund allocations are highly valued by LHDs , as they represent a stable , recurring , and fl exible funding source that can be used for a variety of purposes.36 However, t he current state budget for the 2021 -2023 biennium (P.L. 165 -2021) only provides a $3,915,209 total appropriation for each year of the biennium , which amounts to $0.57 per person . The LHM fund requires allocations based on the formula in Table 4, below. As shown in the table, smaller counties generally receive higher per capita amounts , with the 40 smallest counties receiving per capita amounts of $1 .00 or more. Table 4: FYs 2022 and 2023 Local Health Maintenance Fund Allocations County Population Annual Grant Amount No. of Counties (per 2020 Census) Per Capita Range (per 2020 Census) > 499,999 $94,112 1 $0.10 (Marion) $33,139 64 $0.68 (Henry) $5.58 (Ohio) LHD s are Heavily Dependent on Local Revenue Across the country, funding sources for LHDs vary based on the state's governance model and the scope of clinical services provided at the local level. On average, however, NACCHO reports that the largest source of LHD revenue in 2019 was federal grants and distributions (27%) , followed by local revenues (25%), state grants a nd distributions (21%), Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance (12%), non -clinical fees and fines (8%) and other sources (7%).37 Similar to other states that have decentralized public health governance models,38 Indiana LHDs are more heavily reliant on property tax funding.39 Although federal funding amounts were not available, the 2020 Fairbanks Report noted that self -reported dat a from an annual IDOH survey reflects local funding that is more than three times greater than state funding. (Figure 10). Local Health Maintenance (LHM) Fund LHM Fund s are highly valued by LHDs , as they represent a stable and recurring funding source that can be used for a variety of purposes . Public Health Funding Findings 50 Indiana law requires the fiscal body of each county with an LHD (or the fiscal body of a city for a municipal LHD) to assess a property tax to maintain the LHD and deposit the tax proceeds into a County Health Fund (CHF) , which may only be used for public health purposes.40 Public health revenues from other sources used to support the LHD (e.g., fee and fine revenues, third -party payments for cli nical services, etc.) are also deposited into the CHF. According to the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance (DLGF) - the state agency that certifies local budgets and property tax levies and rates - CHF property tax distributions equate to rough ly 60 percent of certified CHF budgets in recent years (Figure 11). (These DLGF data, however, do not include some grant funds [e.g., from state, federal, or private sources ] that are held outside the CHF in separate, segregated funds , so it is not a compl ete picture of all LHD funding sources. DLGF is not required to certify those amounts , and LHDs are not required to report them. ) According to DLGF data, 2021 CHF property tax draws ranged from under $3.00 per capita (using 2020 Census data) to $43.93 per capita in Marion County. (Table 5) Figure 10: Indiana LHD Average Source of Funding Per Capita (2020 Dollars) Note: Figure 10 is based on 2016 -2018 data self-reported by LHDs in an annual IDOH survey that does not provide information about federal funding and is not available for all LHDs.

Many of thes e challenges relate to local governance approval requirements and associated timelines. For example:41 Grant periods and submission deadlines are often not aligned with the county budget cycle or county approval timelines and processes. For example, many LHDs must receive permission in advance from the County Council to apply for a grant. County Council meeting schedules vary by county , and some meet only monthly. Some grants also require a County Council appropriation (usually determined by the Fund Ordin ance required for each grant, which must be approved by the County Commissioners). This entire approval process can take two weeks to two months. Time -limited grants where long -term sustainability is not assured can be problematic , as County Councils are often reluctant to approve new staff positions needed to carry out grant activities if the county could be liable for increased unemployment insura nce claims when the employment ends. \"Cash in hand\" requirements slow down grant implementation. In many counties, g rant- related h iring and project work cannot begin until the grant contract is fully executed. In addition to approval delays that occur at t he local level, grant contracts are sometimes delayed at the state level , making it difficult or impossible to complete the grant activities within the remaining grant period. Public Health Funding Findings 52 Grant expenditure requirements may be very prescriptive and fail to align with perceived or actual county public health needs . In some cases, LHD officials have reported that County Councils have failed to approve grants that would be used for public healt h purposes with which they disagree. For example, in September 2021, the Elkhart County Council rejected a $3 million federal grant sought by its LHD, based on a community health needs assessment, that would have allowed the LHD to hire staff to provide ed ucation on chronic diseases to Black, Hispanic and Amish residents over a three -year period. The rejection came after public testimony by grant opponents e xpress ing distrust of the government and health experts and raising fears that the money would lead t o forced vaccination .42 Grant reporting requirements and systems can be administratively burdensome. Individualized and detailed reporting requirements are often duplicative, administratively burdensome, and fail to provide data feedback to the LHD to supp ort program improvements . New grant awards often lead to funding supplantation. Rather than increasing an LHD's financial resources to enhance service levels, County Councils often view new grant awards as an opportunity to reallocate other LHD funding fo r other non -public health priorities. See Appendix H for additional information on county budget and grant approval processes and timeline s. Opportunity Exists to Enhance Medicaid Reimbursement for LHD Clinical Services Some LHD services are clinical in nature (e.g., immunizations, STI testing and treatment, etc.) and therefore may be subject to Medicaid reimbursement when the service is provided to a Medicaid -enrolled person. However, a ccording to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration's Medicaid Office of Policy and Planning, only about half (46) of Indiana's LHDs received Medicaid reimbursement , totaling $1.24 million between Nov . 1, 2020, and Nov . 1, 2021. Based on the annual IDOH LHD survey, some LHDs r eport that they are unable to bill all of the Indiana Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) , and even fewer LHDs report billing Medicare. (Table 6) Public Health Funding Findings 53 Table 6: 2020 IDOH Annual LHD Survey , Billing for Medical Services (n = 56 LHDs responding ) # of LHDs Medicaid enrolled 38 Credentialed with all 4 MCOs 28 Actively billing 34 Medicaid reimbursements reported for 2020 21 Medicare reimbursements reported for 2020 9 Other charges for medical services 39 In the 2020 survey, LHDs reported a number of barriers and challenges to Medicaid claiming , including: Challenges dealing with multiple pay ors Limitations related to the LHD's current billing software Lack of needed training or the need for billing assistance MCO staff not trained to deal with a public health entity Administrative burden of billing issues and paperwork Keeping up with MCO payment polic y changes Public Health Funding Findings 54 The public health funding recommendations and action items that follow address the following overall goals: Increase public health funding to achieve consistent per capita spending at the 2019 national average of $9 1 per person as compared to Indiana's $55 per person Adjust for inflation and s ustain public health investments to ensure long -term improvement in he alth outcomes through consistent programming Maximize all available public health funding sources Provide transparency and accountability for public health expenditures Recommendation 9: Provide local health departments with stable, recurring , and flexible funding to build and sustain their foundational public health capacities. Action items: A. Request an increase in annual appropriations for the 2024 -25 biennium and future biennial budget s. B. Increase state -funded Local Health Maintenance Fund (LHMF) allocations to support the provision of a n essential set of public health services in each county, taking into account county population and district support services . C. Condition receipt of additional LHMF allocations at the county level on: (1) a vote by loca l elected officials' every five years to opt in to expanded services , with education to local elected officials to delineate ramifications of an opt -out vote; a county could rescind its opt-out vote within a year. (2) maintenance of effort for local health bud gets of up to 20% local cost -sharing with approval of county fiscal body. Recommendation 10: Provide LHDs with administrative supports and other flexibilities to leverage all available funding sources. Action items: A. Create an IDOH surge staffing program to increase the capacity of LHDs to maximize categorical grant opportunities . B. IDOH will facilitate insurance and Medicaid billing for direct clinical services provided by LHDs that request this support . C. Allow consolidated LHDs to operate as Municipal Corporations, subject to the appointment of the Municipal Corporation's governing board by the county executives of each constituent county . Public Health Funding Findings 55 Recommendation 11: Establish consistency in the tracking of the public health resources and calculate t he return on investment of additional funding allocations . Action items: A. Track public health revenues and expenditures across IDOH and all LHDs on a consistent basis, in conjunction with the State Board of Accounts and the Department of Local Government F inance. Consider adopting the Public Health Uniform Chart of Accounts . B. Offer IDOH -sponsored annual training regarding public health and public health finance for county auditors, commissioners, and councilors. Workforce Findings 56 Workforce Findings More Public Health Workforce Data are Needed to Inform Policy & Planning Indiana has provisions43 in place to ensure the availability of supply information on the healthcare workforce, including licensed health professionals working in clinical care and/or in public health. However, information on the public health workforce outside of licensed health care personnel is limited and insufficient to inform state and local planning. A formal statewide analysis of the governmental public health workforce , to include educational level, salaries, and job description , is needed to understand the current state a nd to develop and prioritize recommendations. In addition, strategies are needed to ensure Indiana has sufficient data to inform future and ongoing policy and planning related to the health workforce. Some data sources provide limited information on the public health workforce. As illustrated in Table 7, these sources have limitations, which generally include a small reporting sample and are not likely to be representative of the public health workforce throughout Indiana. Table 7: Overview of Current Public Health Workforce Datasets Dataset Detail Limitations Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS) Individual employees provide information on education, job satisfaction, retention, and competency gaps , as well as individual demographics. Historically only surveyed Marion County Public Health Department (MCPHD) and IDOH with <=50% response rate.44 Region V 2020 Public Health Training Center Survey Questions about training needs. Survey completed by health officer or representative about their employees . First survey conducted in 2020. Only 35 of Indiana's 94 LHDs responded . Statewide Annual Survey of Local Health Departments (LHD) Administrator (or rep.) completes survey about staffing (FT/PT) by specific roles and starting salaries by role. Also collects budget/funding data, as well as number of services provided & fees collected. Workforce gaps/needs, recruitment/retention issues not included in the report. Data not collected by each LHD annually. Information seems to be reported differently across LHDs (e.g., financial data validity/reliability issues). Existing data about Indiana's local public health workforce are limited . Workforce Findings 57 Developing state capacity to collect information on the public health workforce is critical for public health workforce asse ssments. Leveraging existing processes or reporting strategies is the most effective means by which states can collect health workforce information. Indiana already does this with licensed health professionals, but many public health professionals are not members of licensed occupations. A strategy to collect information on unlicensed public health professionals, especially those working in governmental public health, is needed to support workforce assessments and inform development initiatives. Increased Public Health Workforce Capacity Needed Although a comprehensive assessment of Indiana's public health workforce is needed to identify the state's workforce needs, some shortages can already be enumerated. Indiana has a known workforce capacity issue. According to a recent report,45 Indiana communities are less likely to be implementing nationally recommended public health activities compared to other states. This i s likely related to the number of employees and their workload, as well as the skills and preparation of the workforce. Local Health Department Workforce Among Indiana's 94 LHDs, 70 percent (n=65) are considered small based on the size of the population served. These 65 LHDs have an average of five full -time employees and fewer than 10 total employees. Some small LHDs have as few as zero full -time employees or as many as 11 part -time employees. Additionally, smaller LHDs tend to employ part -time health officials who often serve as a physician in a clinical setting and support the LHD as needed. Among Indiana LHDs, 55 have part -time health officials and 39 have full -time roles in their agencies. Information captured from the licensed health workforce found that 23 physicians46 and four dentists47 reported a primary practice at a local hea lth department and 536 registered nurses48 reported a specialty in public health. Figure 12: Average Proportion of Activities Completed by LHDs (weighted by population) Workforce Findings 58 Table 8: LHD Employees by Population Served49 Data on training gaps among Indiana's governmental public health workforce is too limited to be actionable. Nationally, mos t public health workers (four out of five) do not have formal training in public health.50 This impacts the feasibility of cross -training for competencies and the provision of foundational public health services. Healthcare Workforce In Indiana, healthcar e professionals represent a sizable proportion of the public health workforce. National data on Indiana suggest that at least 25 percent of Indiana's public health workforce are licensed health professionals.51 Indiana has recognized health workforce short ages that threaten both clinical care and public health service availability . Some shortages, such as federal health professional shortage areas that assess primary care, mental health and dental workforce shortages in Indiana communities , are more clearly enumerated than others .52 Information reported from healthcare professionals and employers demonstrate s substantial unmet demand exists among certain healthcare professionals/workers (e.g., nursing, certified nursing aide, dental assistants, respiratory c are practitioners, medical assistants, etc.) and in certain healthcare roles (e.g., nursing faculty) and settings (e.g., school health). Developing strategies to address healthcare workforce shortages is important to improve Hoosier health, both at the pop ulation and individual level. Policies to Support Workforce Recruitment and Retention Are Needed Recent findings from both national and state workforce surveys indicate a wave of retirements and staff losses are on the horizon in public health . Yet recruitment of skilled public health workers remains challenging.53 National findings about governmental public health recruitment barriers include a general lack of awareness of job postings, misalignment between Workforce Findings 59 job requirements and the available workforce, and misalignment between openings and salary expectations.54, 55, 56 Additionally, the retention of healthcare workforce in certain roles and settings has also been a noted challenge, increasingly so with the COVID -19 public health emergency. Ensuring state policies support the efficient licensing and recruitment of qualified professionals in high demand occupations is critical to workforce develo pment. Training opportunities for healthcare professionals in public health are also critical to ensuring a sufficiently skilled workforce. Current Public Health Workforce Pipeline and Retention Although data on the governmental public health workforce is limited, the state can quantify the number of graduates from public health training programs at Indiana's public institutions.57 Over the last decade, Indiana's pu blic health training capacity has increased significantly (Figure 13). It is uncertain to what extent graduates from Indiana's public health training programs are retained in the state and into governmental public health within the state. A fo rmal assessment of public health talent retention in Indiana would be useful to inform and target workforce development initiatives. Additionally, Indiana has not previously conducted a purposeful assessment of the health workforce training pipeline. A pi peline assessment provides valuable information on the number of slots/trainees within a given program and at various stages of training. The number of trainees within a given training pipeline represent s the potential future workforce for the state within a given role or occupation. Supporting Recruitment and Retention Through Incentive Programs Incentive programs, such as scholarship and loan repayment programs, are common mechanisms by which states support recruitment of workforce into areas and settings of need. These programs typically provide monetary relief of training costs in exchange for periods of service in specific areas or settings. Workforce incentive programs are common in health care. Figure 13: Public Health Degrees Conferred by Indiana's Public Institutions Workforce Findings 60 Currently, Indiana administers a federally supported loan repayment program that is limited to federally defined professions and geographies. Existing programming is insufficient to promote recruitment and retention of healthcare and public health professionals , for whom there is great demand. Both federal and state government -based workforce incentive programs are available. The most common program administered by the federal government is the National Health Service Corps (NHSC).58 Additionally, the National Health Services Corps State Loan Repayment Program (NHSC SLRP) is funded in part by the federal government but administered by states. The federal government has formal guidelines and requirements for both programs, including the qualifying healthcare professionals and settings. The NHSC SLRP program, administered by the IDOH, has made incentives available to healthcare professionals. However, because it is structured as a federal match program, Indiana must structure incentives and qualifying professionals in alignment with federal guidelines. As such, non -clinical public health professionals and public health settings (such as state or local public health departments) do not qualify for loan repayment. In addition to the NHSC SL RP program, Indiana has several other health workforce incentive initiatives currently in operation.59 There is limited coordination across these initiatives. As highlighted in Table 9, in response to their need for state -based workforce planning and dev elopment, some states have created state -sovereign incentive programs for health professionals beyond traditional clinical care workforce incentive programming. Indiana does not have a health workforce incentive program that supports recruitment of public health or healthcare professionals outside of those already targeted through federal programs (example: nursing faculty). Coordination across the various health workforce incentive programs and development of state capacity to support targeted recruitment among professions and settings of need would provide much needed workforce development support. Workforce Findings 61 Table 9: Examples of State -Sovereign Incentive Programs State Incentive Program California Allied Healthcare Loan Repayment program offers up to $16,000 toward professional loans, including some public health roles (such as health educa tors, clinical laboratory scientists, community health worker s, among others). Illinois Offers nurse educators loan repayment on eligible loans taken to achieve education requirements toward becoming a registered nurse and/or nurse educator. Award amounts are based on an applicant's balance of eligible loans but will not exceed $5,000 per year. Louisiana Established the Small Town Health Professional Tax Credit Program (up to $3,600) to provide income tax credit for professionals practicing in health professional shortage areas in rural Louisiana. Minnesota Established a state -sovereign loan repayment program ($6,000 per year) for RNs and licensed practice nurses who serve in nursing homes or intermediate care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities. New Mexico Established the Rural Health Care Practitioner Tax Credit to provide up to $5,000 tax credit for certain practitioners who practice in rural or underserved areas. Promoting Experiential Learning in Public Health Indiana's schools of public health and community health programs are the major pipeline for its public health workforce. While a comprehensive heal th workforce assessment is needed to identify shortages, the available information suggests the number of individuals with formal public health training employed in governmental public health within Indiana's local jurisdictions is insufficient . Determinin g the extent to which graduates from Indiana's public institutions ' public health training programs are employed at governmental public health would help inform strategies to enhance recruitment into governmental public health. In advance of such assessmen t, opportunities to enhance knowledge and experience of public health students with governmental public health could be explored. Experiential learning and service experiences represent such strategies. Applied practice experiences are accreditation requ irements for Master of Public Health degree programs.60 These practice experiences may include a practicum or internship experience, which may or may not involve governmental public health. The extent to which students enrolled in Indiana's public health t raining programs engage in practice experiences in governmental public health is not known; however, given reports of governmental public health Workforce Findings 62 workforce shortages, such opportunities could be explored as a strategy to develop student skills and promote w orkforce development. In addition to formal applied practice experiences, accredited Master of Public Health degree programs provide opportunities for student involvement in community and professional service.61 Such opportunities in governmental public health would increase knowledge and awareness of governmental public health as an employment sector and may support recruitment. Supporting Recruitment Through Fellowships In addition to providing short -term experiential learning opportunities for public health students prior to becoming a public health professional, public health fellowships may provide an opportunity to recruit public health professionals in high -priority areas. Fellowships are funded, competitive training opportunities that enable students or recent graduates to advance, synthesize or increase their skills in their field s. Fellowships are often completed after a degree has been conferred and are often purs ued in place of full -time employment, often for a fixed duration of one to two years. In the public health space, the CDC has developed an extensive portfolio of fellowships within various public health specialty areas. Fellowships are available at the nat ional level for public health graduates at the bachelor's, master's , and doctoral levels, as well as available opportunities for clinicians. Fellowships may be an excellent opportunity for the State to develop high ly skilled public health professionals in specialties and areas of need such as epidemiology, health information technology, laboratory, etc. If development of fellowship opportunities is pursued by the state, the strategy could be combined with other s (such as rete ntion bonuses or loan repayment programming) to support retention of fellows in -state. Providing Public Health Exposure and Experience to Health care Students and Professionals Over the past few decades, healthcare curriculum has begun to integrate public health topics and considerations within student academics. However, the COVID -19 pandemic demonstrated the need for a closer relationship and deeper understanding of public health within health care. Cross -training Indiana healthcare professions students w ith public health knowledge, skills, and experience is a top priority for public health. Cross -training could be achieved through bi -directional interprofessional education experiences among public health students and clinicians. Workforce Findings 63 Informal information from Indiana's health professions programs demonstrates that great strides have been made to incorporate the social determinants of health and health equity into and across curriculum. In some cases, targeted public , and community health content and/or experien ces are woven into the degree requirements. While Indiana's health professionals training programs have implemented various strategies to incorporate public health information into the curriculum of learners, a state -level review of these strategies has not been performed previously. Health Workforce Policy and Planning Coordination is Needed No entity is formally charged with the development and oversight of a state plan for Indiana's health workforce, and no formalized coordination for health workforce c onversations occurs across existing initiatives. Indiana has many formal and informal entities that are engaged in policy and programmatic work that is related, either directly or indirectly, to the health workforce.62 Each of these initiatives has a uniqu e focus area , and some have overlapping membership or representation. Coordination across these initiatives would enhance state -level health workforce planning, support greater alignment, enable the identification and leveraging of synergies, and potential ly minimize duplication of effort. Over the last five years, Indiana has developed informal capacity for health workforce policy coordination in the Governor's Health Workforce Council. This Council was informally charged with coordinating health workfor ce-related policies, programs, and initiatives within Indiana to reduce cost, improve access and enhance quality within Indiana's health system . It brings together state agencies, legislators, healthcare experts and industry leaders. To date, the Council h as primarily focused its work on the healthcare workforce. Additionally, numerous initiatives in Indiana support specific aspects of workforce development in the health sector or in general. Ensuring public health and/or health care workforce perspective r epresentation in existing initiatives is a critical strategy to support alignment, as is ensuring workforce development is involved in key health sector workforce discussions. For example, the Indiana Graduate Medical Education (GME) board is responsible for decision -making regarding the allocation of state funds for expansion of medical residencies. As such, the GME Board has a significant role in determining funding and skill mix for the future physician workforce, including potential future state and loc al health officers. The Board 's current composition does not include dedicated public health representation. Workforce Findings 64 The workforce recommendations and action items that follow address the following overall goals: Ensure Indiana has sufficient information on the health (public health and health care) workforce to identify shortages and support workforce planning . Enhance training, recruitment, and retention to ensure workforce capacity and skills are sufficient to support Hoosier health .

Data and Information Integration Findings 66 Data and Information Integration Findings Siloed Public Health Data Systems Limit Policymakers ' Access to Actionable Information The ability to collect, report, analyze, and access data across the public health system is critical to risk identification and development of actionable plans to improve population health. Public health data encompasses a wide range of data sources , including health system data and disease incidence, populatio n behavior data (e.g. , smoking status, exercise patterns, diet, etc.), and environmental data ( e.g., lead, drinking water pollution, restaurant safety, and septic system compliance). It is historically siloed by disease condition, environmental factor, fun ding source , and reporting requirements. This structure results in numerous systems that lack the ability to interface or provide meaningful data to support local, regional, and state level analysis and policy making. In addition, ongoing paper -based proce sses create a void in the ability to monitor, track , and compare outcomes across counties and regions. National efforts are underway to improve the interoperability and utility of data and systems that promote public health and specific actions can be take n at a state level to support the unique public health data and systems needs in Indiana. Figure 14: Public Health System - Data Owners and Utilizers63 Data and Information Integration Findings 67 Coordination Across Data Owners is Lacking In Indiana, public health data has multiple data owners across the health system. Hospitals, local health departments, state agencies including IDOH, FSSA, the Indiana Department of Corrections, and others , own key data elements and have key data needs that are important to understanding and identifying emerging public health issues and improving the health of Hoosiers. In the current environment, there is little coordination between the entities, and data are stored and transferred in different formats with different privacy and security protections and access and use restrictions. The systems and processes used to aggregate and store data vary from manual paper -based processes, to antiquated legacy systems, to some modernized systems and interfaces. Coordination across these entities has little overarch ing direction , and there is no process to build consensus for priorities for investment in public health data and resources. At the same time, we have heard from Hoosiers through the Commission Listening Tours and the public comment submission form that protection of data and maintenance of confidentiality are paramount. Our work in this area needs to keep th is feedback in mind. Indiana Can Build on COVID -19 Response Enhancements The fragmented nature of the current data systems and the benefit of improving coordination and priorities became apparent over the course of the COVID -19 public health emergency. To meet the need for timely reporting to identify and monitor infection rates, locations, and hospital capacity and vaccination rates, the IDOH led a group to rapidly develop new and enhanced connections between public health system data owners and continually improved COVID -19 data timeliness and quality during the public health emergency. The establishment of new data connections and enhancement of existing data connections provided timely data to inform policy making and supported the development and continual improvement of actionable public -facing dashboards. The convening of public health systems stakeholders to support the process to develo p new connections, the priorities established by the IDOH and stakeholder input, and the establishment of near real -time public dashboarding during a rapidly evolving public health crisis demonstrate the value of increasing coordination and prioritization of data and systems across public health system stakeholders. In addition, the dashboard's ability to provide near real -time metrics on the status of the COVID -19 public health emergency represented a shift in the dissemination of public health data in Indiana. Prior to the development of COVID -19 dashboarding, data dissemination did not occur in near -real time but occurred after validation and finalization of required reporting Data and Information Integration Findings 68 on public health data metrics if the data was made available or accessible t o the public. The improved connections, supporting better reporting and timeliness and public access to data , provide a case study of the value of establishing public health system stakeholder buy -in on data priorities . It also supports making information available to the public on a statewide basis versus having data available only at the local health department level . A formal entity charged with the advancement of health and public health data and investment, oversight of health data governance and dat a privacy , and security could build on the progress made during the COVID -19 public health emergency in enhancing data connections and reducing manual reporting. Figure 15: New and Enhanced Data Connections to support the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency Greater State Coordination with Health Information Exchanges Would Promote Data Integration Goals One of the key stakeholders in the Indiana health and public health data system is the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE). IHIE is a pri vate not -for-profit entity that aggregates health data and facilitates health system connections between enrolled providers, state agencies, and insurance companies. As a point of service function, data available to providers via health information exchang e connections can reduce provision of duplicate care or Data and Information Integration Findings 69 procedures and potential complications or adverse reactions . IHIE also supports disease surveillance and required reporting to the IDOH . Experience during the COVID -19 pandemic demonstrated the val ue of Health Information Exchanges as key stakeholders in providing timely information that supports public health decision making. However, it also identified gaps and challenges related to the lack of a formal state relationship with the health informat ion exchange , including: The ability to coordinate and prioritize improvements across Health Information Exchange stakeholders , including multiple state agency engagements Achieving cross -stakeholder buy -in on overall enhancements and initiatives that benefit the public health and health system , such as increasing the providers connected, speci fically long -term care and mental health providers, allowing for bi -directional communication back to connected providers, and ensuring data such as race and ethnicity are standardized. A lack of ability to capture federal funding available via Medicaid and grant opportunities Establishment of a formal relationship between the state and a health information exchange partner would support the abili ty to coordinate and prioritize state data needs and data enhancement among state stakeholders and improve the ability to capture federal funding to support health information exchange activities. Most Local Health Departments Report Data -Related Needs an d Barriers LHDs play a key role in the public health data environment and are responsible for monitoring and reporting data at a local level. LHDs have varying levels of technology to support the collection and submission of data and varying levels of staff expertise to support local data analysis and interpretation. This results in varying level of data analysis and monitoring and ability to identify local public health issues depending on county. A survey completed as a component of research on this report shows that over half (54%) of LHD respondents (1) do not have the ability to access all the data that would be useful and (2) have barriers to obtaining data due mainly to personnel, limited technology resources, and funding. LHDs also reported nee ding support with data analysis (77%) and were interested Data and Information Integration Findings 70 in training on data analysis (70%). Comments submitted on the survey had themes such as needing to be able to access data once it was submitted for required reporting to the IDOH, challenges with de dicating personnel to data analysis and projects, and challenges with manual processes and reporting. The wide variation in the capacity and systems available at the LHDs and the LHD needs for access to additional data and support with analysis suggest that additional funding and district level support for data analysis and development would increase the ability to complete local and regional data analysis and the accessibility of public health data to support community decision making.

IDOH began a digital transformation project of its existing public health systems in 2020. I n the current state, IDOH operates 105 systems, 54 of which contain critical health data. The systems are siloed, and no enterprise public health system supports data collection and analysis across all IDOH programs. The goals of the digital transformation project are to develop a data and technology roadmap, establish technology and data governance, create a centralized data and analytics platform, and improve data access . In addition, system updates and upgrades will be prioritized, and security will be enhanced. This project is critical to advancing public health in Indiana and growing IDOH systems and analytical support capabilities.

Establish funding to continue digital transformation efforts to support implementation and ongoing operations of GPHC recommendations. Emergency Preparedness Findings 74 Emergency Preparedness Findings Emergency Preparedness Response Approaches Have Adapted Over Time to Address Evolving Threats The United States has a long history of response to emergencies and disasters, including active civil defense (in preparation for nuclear war) and emergency management organizations at the local, state, and federal levels. The focus of emergency management and response organizations has changed over time as new risks were identified and methods for handling the variou s risks were developed. The increasingly harmful impacts of natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornado es were the catalyst for legislation and augmented targeted funding specifically for natural disasters. The need to consolidate and organize responses soon became apparent, resulting in the establishment of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), from which was developed the Integrated Emergency Management System (IEMS). IEMS focused on an all - hazards approach of preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. As such, emergency responses were streamlined with the development and maintenance of credible emergency management capabilities accomplished by integrating activities along functional lines of all levels of government and across all hazards. Figure 18 depicts the history of events that have necessitated a more coordinated and capabilities -based approach to emergency response. 64 Community Engagement Focus Arose After 9/11 The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and subsequent anthrax scares in that same year incited dramatic changes in emergency management. Emergency management shifted to a Figure 18: Emergency Response History of Events , 2001 - 2018 Emergency Preparedness Findings 75 more proactive emergency preparedness approach, with priorities, funding and p ractices re - evaluated. While the all -hazards approach remained central to emergency preparedness, a signature shift was the engagement of the entire community , with the intention of involving the private sector, community groups and individual citizens in disaster preparedness. This approach leveraged community resilienc e and shifted to local leadership and coordination. CDC Has Established National Standard s for Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response CDC created the Public Health Preparedness Capabilities to assist state and local health departments with their strategic planning. As shown in Table 10, t he 15 capabilities span six domains: Community Resilience, Incident Management, Information Management, Countermeasures and Mitigation, Surge Management and Bio -surveillance. Table 10: CDC Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Capabilities65 Domain Capabilities Community Resilience #1 Community Preparedness #2 Community Recovery Incident Management #3 Emergency Operation Coordination Information Management #4 Emergency Public Information and Warning #6 Information Sharing Countermeasures and Mitigation #8 Medical Countermeasure Dispensing and Administration #9 Medical Material Management and Distribution #11 Nonpharmaceutical Interventions #14 Responder Safety and Health Surge Management #5 Fatality Management #7 Mass Care #10 Medical Surge #15 Volunteer Managemen t Bio-surveillance #12 Public Health Laboratory Testing #13 Public Health Surveillance and Epidemiological Investigation This set of capabilities creates a national standard for public health preparedness capability - based planning and assists state and local planners in identifying gap s in preparedness, determining the specific jurisdictional priorities, and developing plans for building and sustaining capabilities. Emergency Preparedness Findings 76 Emergency Response in Indiana is Primarily Federally Funded The overarching goal s of emergency preparedness are to ensure safety from natural and man-made hazardous incidents and reduce/mitigate the loss of life through education and planning for any possible hazard at any time. Emergency response in Indiana is primari ly funded through federal grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ), the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (ASPR) and CDC. (Table 11). Table 11: Federal Emergency Prep aredness Grants State Agency Federal Agency Grant Name IDOH CDC Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) ASPR Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) Indiana Department of Homeland Security FEMA Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness (HMEP) Individual Assistance Each of these funding sources is critical to the process of preparedness (Figure 19), which is supported by the CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Capabilities . For example, the CDC's Community Resilienc e domain corresponds with \"Recov ery\" in Figure 19 and the Incident Management domain corresponds with \"Response, \" as does the Information Management domain . The Counterm easures and Mitigation domain corresponds to \"Mitigation, \" and the Surge Management domain corresponds to both \"Prepar edness \" and \"Response. \" Lastly, the Biosurveillance domain corresponds with \"Prevention, \" as early detection and prevention efforts can reduce the spread of disease threats. Figure 19: Emergency Preparedness Process Emergency Preparedness Findings 77 IDOH Division of Emergency Preparedness Leads Indiana's Public Health Emergency Preparedness Response The IDOH Division of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) is primarily charged with promoting the overall preparedness, readiness, and resilience for public health and health care across Indiana. DEP prepares for and responds to pub lic health emergencies and events throughout Indiana's 10 Public Health Preparedness Districts through four sections: (1) District and Local Readiness , (2) Logistics , (3) Planning and Preparedness , and (4) Mobile Response . The CDC PHEP Grant Promotes Seaml ess Coordination Across the State The DEP administers the CDC Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Cooperative Agreement , which provides public health emergency preparedness grant funding to LHDs , although not all LHDs apply for this funding. PHEP grant s include funding for a local 0.5 full - time equivalent (FTE) emergency preparedness coordinator to ensure seamless coordination across the state. The grant also funds t raining and technical assistance to build local capacity to lead resp onse efforts and facilitate statewide support for coordinated preparedness and response. EMResource Maximizes Connectivity During Public Health Emergencies EMResource is a web-based tool that provides cross -sector communication during a disaster or disease outbreak , allowing for better resource management . The data housed in EMResource is used to provide real-time updates of healthcare capabilities on a local, regional, and statewide level. For example, using EMResource, IDOH and other users can : Send time -sensitive alerts Review hospital diversion statuses Determine bed availability Share available resources to assist hospitals in need During the COVID -19 pandemic, IDOH has also used EMResource to ensure that hospitals and physicians receive the personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing supplies that they need ed. For example, early in the pandemic, when h ospitals, local health departments , and long -term care facilities update d EMResource with information regarding their current PPE supplies, IDOH was able to deploy its PPE stockpile resources to the areas of greatest need. Emergency Preparedness Findings 78 To optimize the value of the EMResource tool for resource management and connectivity during emergencies, however, the tool must be widely adopted by LHDs, hospi tals, long-term care facilities, and other providers and first responders. IDOH Readiness Depends on its Ability to Rapidly Scale Up Resources During Emergencies Having Pre -Approved Vendor Scopes of Work in Place W ould Improve Readiness The ability to scale up during a public health emergency quickly and efficiently depends greatly on the level of preparedness. Preparedness may include staff and contracted vendors, standing at the ready for deployment or contract implementation when the n eed is determined, avoiding delays with hiring or procurement processes. Having pre -approved vendors and contracted staff (e.g. , emergency medical staff) through memoranda of understanding (MOUs) , predefined scopes of work, and other pre-negotiated arrange ments will increase the speed and time by which response measures can be utilized. Establishing a State Strategic Stockpile Would Improve Readiness The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) is a national repository of antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, and other medical supplies intended to be used as a short -term, stopgap buffer when immediate supplies are not available or sufficient at a state or local level.66 During the initial wave of the COVID -19 pandemic, however, the SNS was unable to meet the demand for ventilators and PPE for healthcare workers (e.g., N95 masks, surgical masks, gloves, face shields ). Creating a Strategic State Stockpile, along with appropriate inventory management processes and procedure s, would reduce Indiana's reliance on the SNS and improve the state's public health emergency readiness. T raining exercises to practice efficient dissemination of countermeasures, PPE, or other resources will also require the engagement of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS). Gaps Remain in the State's Trauma Care System Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death for individuals between the ages of 1 -44 years in the United States. Traumatic injury results in more years of potential life lost than any other disease process , including cancer and heart disease. Injury is America's most expensive disease process , costing nearly $180 million per year. In Indiana, the leading causes of death for individuals aged 1-44 are preventable injuries.67 Emergency Preparedness Findings 79 A trauma system is an organized approach to facilitating and coordinating a multidisciplinary system response to severely injured patients. The trauma system continuum of care includes injury prevention, emergency medical services field intervention, emergency department care, surgical interventions, intensive and general surgical in -hospital care, rehabilitative services, social services, and support groups to enable both patient s and their families to return to society at the most produ ctive level possible. Multiple studies have shown that implementation of an organized trauma system results in a 50 to 80 percent reduction in preventable deaths. While the focus is on trauma care, it is important to note that many of the issues discuss ed also affect access to other time -sensitive emergency care, including myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and strokes. Until March 2006, Indiana was among a handful of states with no laws or regulations granting oversight authority for trauma care. P roper oversight is a necessary element of any trauma system. Public Law 155 -2006 , with support from resolutions by the Indiana State Medical Association and the Indiana Emergency Nurses Association, changed that. Indiana now has 22 designated trauma cente rs (Table 12) and an active state trauma committee. However, there is more to be done to improve access to trauma care and coordination around the state. Indiana has not received an American College of Surgeons statewide assessment since 2008. The goal is to accomplish this within the next year , and there no doubt will be opportunities identified. Table 12: Number of IN Trauma Centers by Level and Location Level Number Location I 4 + 1 Prov. Marion County II 5 Evansville, Fort Wayne, South Bend III 13 + 1 Prov Anderson, Bloomington, Crown Point, Elkhart, Indianapolis, Jasper, Lafayette, Muncie, Richmond, Terre Haute, Vincennes Access to a trauma center, a hospital that has been verified to be equipped and staffed to provide care for patients suffering from major traumatic injuries such as falls, motor vehicle collisions, or gunshot wounds , is considered essential for trauma care. A review of Indiana's current designated trauma centers shows l arge areas of rural Indiana are more than 45 minutes away from of a trauma center. Three hospitals within those areas have been identified to target Emergency Preparedness Findings 80 to become Level III hospitals , but achieving this goal will require immediate and ongoing funding. Additi onally, coordination and participation in regional trauma care varies across the state. All hospitals, both designated trauma centers and non -trauma centers, need to be trained in trauma care. However, it is essential that critical trauma patients are ta ken to a facility with specific trauma resources no more than two hours after arrival to the lower level of care facility. In 2021, less than half of the patients from Non -Trauma Center (NTC) hospitals were transferred in fewer than two hours. Looking at all hospitals, NTC hos pitals (mostly in rural areas) experienced 91% of the reported delays in transfer. \"EMS issue\" was the number one reason given for the delay , and 50% of those were further defined as \"EMS shortage. \" Indiana EMS runs h ave almost doubled , from 758,115 in 2018 to 1,258,158 in 2021. However, the number of ambulances and EMS providers has decreased in that same time. For example, in 2020, there were 1,789 emergency ambulances in the state, down from over 2,000 in 2018.68 Total EMS personnel (Emergency Medical Responders, Emergency Medical Technicians, Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians, and Paramedics) have also declined , from 24,145 in 2018 to 23,070 in 2021. This was especially evident during the pandemic , when patients were forced to stay at lower level of care facilities for hours to days due to the lack of EMS transport availability. This led IDOH and IDHS to develop a state -supported EMS program that transferred 2,898 Hoosiers, from September 2021 - March 2022, af ter all other options had been exhausted. Figure 2 0: Indiana Trauma Center 45 Minute Access Map Emergency Preparedness Findings 81 The lack of available EMS has also led to counties denying requests for assistance in neighboring counties despite having mutual aid agreements. It used to be the norm for rural EMS and healthcare providers to share that assistance across county lines, but it is now every county for themselves. EMS providers shared that they need to be available for 911 response within their county , so transferring a critically ill patient 5 -6 hours round trip is n ot an option. In the past, more ambulances were available to support the transport. Non -trauma center hospitals shared that the most reliable means of transport for critically ill patients is air ambulance, even when that level of care and time is not ne cessary. When weather does not allow air transport, small hospitals that are not fully equipped to care for the critically ill patient are left caring for the patient until transport becomes available. Emergency medical services is listed as an essential service in statute, similar to fire and law enforcement. However, statute does not define who is ultimately responsible to provide the service. EMS providers vary across the state, in order from most to least : volunteer fire service, career fire service, governmental (example; city or county service), private, hospital based, volunteer ambulance, and industrial. Communication with EMS providers and healthcare and local leaders has discovered several reasons for the lack of available EMS: Lack of EMS providers is due to various reasons , but often due to reimbursement rates and training barriers , leaving emergency medical services for other jobs both within health care (pipeline position, for example going into nursing) and outside of health care (pay) ; difficulty recruiting due to e xtensive training requirements upfront without the ability to work during training ; and, a large proportion of EMS providers are volunteer and have jobs outside of EMS 758,115909,4731,092,0141,258,158 2018 2019 2020 2021Figure 21: EMS Run Volume, 2018 -2021 Emergency Preparedness Findings 82 No one required to provide the essential service , so entities have decrease d or stop ped EMS services Lack of resource sharing , as each county has a singular EMS response plan and no coordination across counties to provide care. Providers shared instances in which a patient was on the border of a county , but EMS would not respond due to being responsible only for their county . Changes in property tax caps have led to decreased funding being available to counties to invest in EMS services Reimbursement for 911 transport based on mileage, not on the servic es provided Inadequate or no reimbursement for transport between facilities , leading EMS providers to decline transport Agencies and the entities that host the EMS agencies list lack of funding as the number one reason for decrease in EMS providers despite the increase in EMS runs The IDOH Division of Trauma and Injury Prevention, IDHS and EMS are committed to working to improve trauma care in Indiana. This work requires the review and analysis of data, program implementation, and system e ducation. With respect to data, a ll hospitals in Indiana, including non -trauma hospitals, are required to input data into the trauma registry. Th ese data help recognize variances in trauma care across the state, including the data on transfer delay. F or example, trauma registry data showed a three fold difference in trauma mortality rates among Indiana's NTC hospitals. However, not all hospitals consistently participate in reporting the data and cite lack of funding to support data registry personnel. As an example of program implementation , IDOH and IDHS are interested in investing in a pediatric pre -hospital care improvement plan utilizing a pediatric resuscitation system proven to save lives. Children made up 5.1% of all EMS incidents in Indiana in 2019. The infrequency of incidents and the unique care required for children allows opportunity for error. Implementation has proven to decrease error, improve pain management, and improve survival. Updated American College of Surgeons Trauma Center Standards require a specific number of FTEs based on the number of trauma patients received at a facility. There is concern hospitals may no longer want to participate as designated trauma centers due to this Emergency Preparedness Findings 83 requirement and the associated cost. The IDOH Division of Trauma and Injury Prevention has limited staff to support the current trauma system data and analysis needs. Future quality improvement work will require increased funding for the trauma and injury prevention division. Funding and Policy Ne eds to Improve Trauma Care in Indiana Funding to support the development of additional Level III trauma centers to improve trauma coverage in rural Indiana Funding to support education and training for non -trauma centers on the identification and stabiliza tion of traumatic patients Funding to support data collection from trauma and non -trauma centers that is necessary for quality care initiatives and regional coordination Reorganization of Indiana State Trauma Committee and subcommittees to better support coordination at the local level Funding for IDOH staff in the Division of Trauma and Injury Prevention , that is not reliant on grants, to provide support for state and regional trauma committees, to ensure data quality, and to provide data analysis for the trauma and non -trauma centers as well as for Hoosiers Conduct needs assessment of specific EMS gaps in local jurisdictions Establish long -term promotional and retention plans for EMS personnel Ensure funding and prioritized recruitment to address workforce shortages in EMS Review current EMS training availability, address gaps and explore opportunities for standardization, identify opportunities to support on -the-job training Explore ongoing training and expansion of community paramedicine progra ms Evaluate stakeholder engagement process to redefine the IDOH emergency preparedness districts Evaluate stakeholder engagement process to redefine roles, responsibilities, and authorities of regional partners Recognizing the current challenges and gaps i n the state's trauma care system, legislation passed by the 2022 Indiana General Assembly69 required the IDHS, IDOH, the Integrated Public Safety Commission, and the Statewide 911 Board to collaborate and make recommendations to the General Assembly before October 31, 2022. The recommendations Emergency Preparedness Findings 84 must address: (1) improving EMS response through increased interoperability of the 911 system and (2) t he effectiveness of regionalized trauma systems and the systems' impact on patient care. House Enrolled Act 1314 -2022 was also adopted by the legislature to address multiple public safety and EMS -related matters. IDOH is building on these efforts through the Statewide Trauma Care Committee and has arranged for an assessment of the State Trauma System to be completed in November 2022 by the American College of Surgeons. Current Public Health Preparedness District Boundaries Are Not Consistent with Organic Health Care and Emergency Response Referral Patt erns The Commission finds that improved district coordination efforts would help ensure a more seamless emergency response. Public Health Preparedness District boundaries align with the IDHS preparedness districts but are not always consistent with organi c healthcare and emergency response referral patterns, and therefore may not work consistently for purposes of emergency response and emergency medicine/trauma care. (Figure 22) For example, Kokomo is a city that is located on the edge of two districts and where training efforts do not align with response models. It is also important to note that some healthcare system areas cross state borders, such as in the northwest and southeast parts of the state , where Chicago , Cincinnati , Louisville have more infrastructure than the local communities. The reverse is true in the Evansville and South Bend area s, where out-of-state residents may seek services at Indiana facilities. Enhanced district -level emergency preparedness coordination would allo w Indiana to address those cross -state line planning needs. A reconsideration of the current boundaries should note that: Different districts have different needs and vary in their proximity to a Level 1 trauma facility Emergencies often cross state or county lines Training and messaging need to go beyond district boundaries Figure 2 2: IDOH Public Health Preparedness Districts Emergency Preparedness Findings 85 Also, revised district boundaries must take into consideration the roles and responsibilities of the following IDHS and IDOH regional partners : COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCIES (EMA S). As the first line of response, EMAs work with local public safety partners and organizations to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from emergencies and liaise with other counties and the state. Across the state, 91 o f 92 Indiana counties have a designated EMA. DISTRICT PLANNING COUNCILS (DPC S). DPCs are comprised of local emergency responders, emergency managers, and representatives from other key agencies. They are responsible for developing emergency response strategies and plans and procedures for their District Planning Councils. DISTRICT PLANNING OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES (DPOC S). DPOCs are comprised of EMA directors, the presidents of each component county's County Commissioners, and the mayor of the largest city in each component county. A DPOC is responsible for formally appointing the members of the DPC and providing executive oversight, support, and guidance for their activities. HEALTH CARE COALITION (HCC): An HCC serve s as a multiagency coordinating group that support s and integrate s with emergency response within a geographic region. An HCC must include representatives from at least two acute care hospitals, one LHD, one EMA and one EMS provider, but some also include long -term care facilities, mental health providers, ambulatory surgical centers, rural health clinics, and others. Emergency Preparedness Findings 86 The emergency preparedness recommendations that follow address the following overall goals: Ensure connectivity and facilitate information exchange in preparation for and during public health emergencies Enhance LHD, IDOH , and EMS readiness Improve the scalability of emergency response efforts beyond the local level Ensure state and local agenc ies have tools to prioritize and maintain responder resilience Recommendation 20: Increase utilization of IDOH's EMResource tool across all Indiana hospitals, LHDs, first responders, healthcare facilities, and applicable government agencies.

Initiate a stakeholder engagement process to redefine the IDOH Emergency Preparedness Districts . B. Initiate a stakeholder engagement process to redefine roles, responsibilities , and authorities of regional partners to improve public health emergency preparedness coordination . Child and Adolescent Health Findings 88 Child and Adolescent Health Findings Opportunity to Improve Health Outcomes for Children and Adolescents Indiana has ranked 29th in the nation since 2019 for overall child well -being.70 The state is ranked 36th for health, dropping from its position as 35th in 2020. Additionally, Indiana's heal th ranking is last among our neighboring states: Illinois (20th), Michigan (2 2nd), Ohio (2 9th), and Kentucky (3 5th). The leading cause of death among Hoosier children ages 1 -19 years is accidents. Suicide is the second -leading cause of death for Indiana yo uth ages 10 -14 years and the third -leading cause of death for youth ages 15 -19 years.71 Overall, these data point to significant opportunities to improve adolescent and child health outcomes and informed the focus of the GPHC and recommendation development process. Schools Play a Crucial Role in Supporting Public Health Throughout the stakeholder engagement process, the critical role of schools in supporting public health was a consistent theme. This informed the focus of GPHC work in exploring opportunities to improve childhood and adolescent health integration and suppo rt schools in the delivery of critical public health services. There is a close relationship between health and education. Studies have demonstrated the link between health and academic success. For example, health -risk behaviors are linked to poor grades, low test scores, and lower educational attainment. Schools play a crucial role in promoting the health of children and adolescents and assisting students in developing lifelong healthy behaviors. Research demonstrates the potential for school health progr ams to reduce youth health risk behaviors and positively impact academic performance.72 Studies further suggest physical activity and fitness improve children's academic and health performance.73 There is a close relationship between health and education. Healthy students are better learners. Figure 2 3: Child Overall Well -Being and Domain Rankings; Indiana: 2014 -2021 Child and Adolescent Health Findings 89 Indiana statute and regulation currently establish a ser ies of requirements surrounding the role of schools in public health -related activities. For example, school corporations are required to provide health services at the elementary and secondary levels, including prevention, assessment, intervention, and re ferral.74 Table 13: Indiana Administrative Code School Health Services Requirements Prevention Creating a safe and healthful school environment through a continuous health program Employing principles of learning and appropriate teaching in the delivery of health education Acting as a resource to students, families, staff, and the community regarding health services, health education, and a healthy environment Assessment Maintaining a continuous health program for all students through implementi ng and monitoring health services Using the nursing process to collect, interpret, and record information about the health, developmental, and educational status of students to determine a nursing diagnosis and develop healthcare plans Intervention Implem enting and monitoring a system for the provision of health services and emergency care Providing individual and group counseling to students and staff in health -related matters Communicating with parents and collaborating with others to facilitate the continuity of services and care Referral Utilizing appropriate healthcare personnel and resources to meet individual student needs Evaluating student and family responses to nursing actions and referrals Coordinating health services with families, other school programs, in -school professionals, school -based and community -based resources Additionally, state statute establishes a series of required school curriculum content on health -related topics . Some, but not all, required curriculum content must be e vidence - or research -based. For example, bullying prevention must be research -based, and instruction on child abuse and child sexual abuse must be research - and/or evidence -based. Statutory requirements for schools are intended to address nutrition and ph ysical activity. Each school corporation must provide daily physical activity for students in elementary school; this may include the use of recess.75 Additionally, all school meals must meet or exceed USDA nutrition Child and Adolescent Health Findings 90 requirements.76 State statute also esta blishes requirements for schools to conduct vision and hearing tests.77 Further, in accordance with federal law, each local education agency (LEA) that participates in the National School Lunch Program or other federal child nutrition program is required to establish a local school wellness policy for all schools under its jurisdiction. Local wellness policies can be an important tool for parents, LEAs, and school districts in promoting student wellness, preventing, and reducing childhood obesity, and providing assurance that school meal nutrition guidelines meet the minimum federal school meal standards . Stakeholders noted that these policies are not meaningfully or consistently implemented across the state due to competing priorities, no enforcement mechanisms, and a lack of resources to address the multiple facets of wellness required in the policy. School Health Service Delivery Models Health services in Indiana schools are primarily delivered through two complementary mechanisms, school nurses and school -based health centers (SBHC). Table 14 provides an overview of the key features of each service d elivery model. Table 14: Overview of School Health Service Delivery Model 78,79 School Nurses SBHCs Overview Leads the school health services team to address barriers to student health and academic success. Serves as public health sentinel within and across school populations and is an advisory resource to teachers and staff. Health clinic located in or near school and organized through school, community, and health provider relationships. Can serve the school population and surrounding comm unity. Funding Employed or contracted by the school district and primarily funded with education dollars Insurance reimbursement, foundations, healthcare systems, and community health center funding Potential Available Services Identifying and addressing behavioral health issues Leveling the field on health disparities and promoting healthy behaviors Primary care Prevention and early intervention Behavioral health counseling Oral health services Health education and nutrition counseling Lab work and prescriptions Child and Adolescent Health Findings 91 School Nurses SBHCs Enrolling children in health insurance and connecting families to healthcare providers Handling medical emergencies Location Practice within the school; currently in Indiana, RN may be shared across schools within a district Traditional : Fixed site on a school campus School -Linked : Fixed site near a school campus through formal or informal linkages with schools Mobile : Specially equipped van or bus parked on or near a school campus Telehealth -Exclusive : Patients access care at a fixed site on a school campus and providers are available remotely using telehealth Parental Consent Required to share information with a healthcare provider or for referral to a provider Parental consent for treatment required Medical Home Coordination School nurse technology platforms exist but are not currently being utilized broadly across the state May be facilitated via electronic health record, providing potential for broader health record access and coordination School Nurses Positively Impact B oth Health -Related and Educational Outcomes The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) both recommend a registered nurse (RN) in every school. Studies have demonstrated the positive impact of school nurse s in areas such as cost savings, reduced absenteeism, and improved vaccination rates. For example, in one study, for each dollar spent on school nurses, $2.20 was saved in parent loss of work time, teacher time, and procedures performed in school rather th an a more costly healthcare setting.80 School nurse interventions have been associated with decreased rates of student absenteeism and early dismissals of students due to health concerns.81 Research has also shown a correlation between use of school nurses and vaccination rates.82 School nurse s also play a critical role for students with disabilities and special healthcare needs in areas such as individualized education programs (IEP),83 504 Plans,84 and medication administration. Child and Adolescent Health Findings 92 Indiana School Nurse Requirements In Indiana, school corporatio ns are required to employ at least one bachelor's level RN , and one RN for every 750 students is recommended. 85,86 There is no formal data collection mechanism to quantify the availability of school nurses; however, it is known that not all school corpora tions meet these standards. According to licensure renewal data, 2.1 percent of all Indiana licensed healthcare professionals reported practicing in school settings, including: 1,708 RNs, 359 LPNs, and 53 APRNs.87 School Nurse Salaries School nurses are t ypically classified by school corporations as support versus certified staff. This contributes to low pay, further exacerbating school nursing shortages , as pay for nurses in other settings is higher. Additionally, when classified as certified staff, pay i s lower than teachers, school nurses' bachelor's -trained counterparts. Indiana Does Not Have a Dedicated Funding Source for School Nurse s There is no dedicated funding source to support school nurse positions; positions are funded primarily through school district budgets. Some schools also partner with hospital systems to staff school nurse positions. Additionally, in response to COVID -19, temporary grants were made available to LHDs to boost connectivity between LHDs and schools , with 77 of 94 LHDs participating. Two Medicaid reimbursement methodologies are available to support school health services and school nurses. Administrative claiming allo ws school corporations to recover federal matching funds for state and locally funded administrative activities that school staff perform to assist students with unmet health care needs.88 Schools may also receive claims reimbursement for certain services rendered by a school -based nurse (RN or LPN licensed under IC 25 -23-1), or other licensed provider employed by or contracted with a school corporation. House Enrolled Act (HEA) 1192, passed during the 2022 legislative session, clarified and expanded the sc ope of school -based services eligible for Medicaid claims reimbursement to include: An individualized education program (as defined in IC 20 -18-2-9) A plan developed under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 794 A behavioral intervent ion plan (as defined in IC 20 -20-40-1) A service plan developed under 511 IAC 7 -34 An individualized healthcare plan Child and Adolescent Health Findings 93 LEAs that participate in Medicaid claims reimbursement retain the federal share of Medicaid reimbursements and restore the state -funded portion t o state tuition support. LEAs may use their unrestricted federal Medicaid funds as they choose. Not all schools are currently seeking Medicaid reimbursement .89 Stakeholders described the process as confusing and requiring school resources to administer, ma king larger schools better positioned to claim and widening disparities among schools. Additionally, some schools may have lower Medicaid enrollment, reducing incentives to implement the infrastructure necessary to seek reimbursement. Indiana's methodolog y for funding school nurses is generally aligned with national trends. Nationally, public school nurses are funded primarily through local education dollars, with some studies citing this as high as 76.7 percent . Additional funding sources, in order of pre valence, include state, federal, health departments, hospital systems, and foundations.90 While other states also rely primarily on education dollars, as a component of this model some states have explicitly accounted for nurses in their school funding formulas, either through a separate funding formula, or within the larger funding formula. These models provide the benefit of funding permanency. Additionally, by dedicating funds to school nurses, there is recognition of the myriad services schools must otherwise fund and the lack of incentives to otherwise prioritize nurse funding as primary accountability is tied to educational outcomes. School -Based Health Centers (SBHC) Improve Educational and Health - Related Outcomes Research has found S BHCs effective in improving educational and health -related outcomes. Increased effectiveness was associated with extended hours of availability and increased range of offered services.91 The development and operation of SBHCs in Indiana ha ve been supported through a variety of initiatives. For example, HRSA grant funding was awarded in 2016 for telehealth equipment in participating Indiana Rural Schools Clinic Network (IRSCN) schools. Additionally, Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) have provided sp onsorship and \"Adopt -A-School\" programs. There is no dedicated funding source to support school nurses. School corporations are held accountable for educational outcomes, creating challenges for prioritization of funding school nurse positions among competing priorities. Indiana had 48 SBHCs (including 3 telehealth -exclusive) as of a 2016 - 2017 national survey. An additional 38 telehealth SBHCs were launched by the IRSCN , and five more are in process. Child and Adolescent Health Findings 94 Some schools partner with health systems or have SBHCs operated by a federally qualified health center (FQHC) or a FQHC look -alike. Indiana Law and Regulations Require a Number of Student Assistance Services in Sc hools As outlined in Table 1 6 below, Indiana statute and administrative code establish a series of requirements to support whole child wellness in schools . Table 15: Current Requirements Supporting Whole Child Wellness in Schools Statutory Requirements Regulatory Requirements Schools must adopt policies to increase child suicide awareness and prevention Schools must provide annual instruction on bullying prevention for students in grades 1 - 12 School corporations & charter schools must enter a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a Community Mental Health Center ( CMHC ) or mental health provider to provide behavioral health services. Written parental/guard ian consent is required for referral. School corporations must provide student assistance services92 coordinated by a school counselor, psychologist, or social worker. Required services include prevention, assessment, intervention, and referral. A ratio of one school counselor, psychologist, or social worker for every 700 students in the school corporati on is recommended for student assistance services. Stakeholders stressed the importance of supporting access to student assistance services in schools and noted access variance across the state. This feedback is aligned with research that demonstrates the positive impact of school counselors, social worker s, and psychologists on areas such as academic achievement, school attendance, dropout rates, and classroom behavior.93 The American School Counselor Association (ASCA) recommends schools maintain a ratio of 250 students per school counselor, and that coun selors spend at least 80 percent of their time work directly with or indirectly for students.94 Additionally, the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) recommends a ratio of one school social worker to 250 students, or 1:50 when providing services to students with intensive needs.95 Further, the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) recommends a 1:500 psychologist -to-student ratio.96 These National associations recommend a 1:250 school counselor or social worker to student ratio. Indiana recommends 1:700 via administrative code. Child and Adolescent Health Findings 95 recommendations provide for a significantly lower ratio than Indiana's current recommendation of 1:700. According to data compiled by the ASCA, in 2020 -21, the national student -to-school counselor ratio was 1:415 and in Indiana was 1:475.97 Currently, there is no dedicated funding mechanism for student assistance services positions. School corporatio ns are held accountable for educational outcomes, creating challenges for prioritization of funding school counselor, social worker, or psychologist positions within their overall budgets. Child and Adolescent Health Findings 96 The child and adolescent health recommendations that follow address the following overall goals: Improve student learning by mitigating health barriers Enhance early childhood education and school -based health education, prevention, and wellness activities Improve access to child and adolescent health care Reduce childhood injuries Recommendation 25: Support policies to increas e the availability of school nurses.

Our poor health inhibits our economic performance, weakens our communities, and shortens the lives of too many Hoosiers. This Commission believes that we can and must do better. The recommendations we set forth in this report will transform Indiana's public health syste m to improve the health and safety of Hoosiers while strengthening communities. We strongly urge state leaders to adopt the recommendations and related action items in their entirety , as each recommendation reinforces and magnifies the impact of the other s. The COVID -19 pandemic - the worst public health emergency in over 100 years - had a devastating impact on our communities, our state , and our nation, and highlighted the fragility of Indiana's current public health system. We must act now to apply the lessons that we have learned and prepare the state for the public health challenges of the future. If we do that, we will not only leave a legacy of good health for future Hoosier generations , but also economic prosperity . Benjamin Disraeli remarked in 18 77 that \"the health of the people is really the foundation upon which all their happiness and all their powers as a state depend.\" This report has demonstrated the public health issues that need to be addressed in order to secure Indiana's future. While the issues might seem great, and even daunting, the solutions we propose are thoughtful and realistic actions that can be taken. 100 Reference s 1 CDC National Center for Health Statistics.

SHARED OR LARGELY SHARED STRUCTURE : Local health units might be led by state employees or by local government employees. If the y are led by state employees, then local government has the authority to make fiscal decisions and/or issue public health orders (4 states). MIXED STRUCTURE : Some local health units are led by state employees, and some are led by local government employees. No single structure predominates (6 states). DECENTRALIZED OR LARGELY DECENTRALIZED STRUCTURE : Local health units are primarily led by local governments em ployees and the local governments retain authority over most fiscal decisions (27 states, including Indiana ).

Appendices 113 Appendix D: Excerpts From \"Indiana Local Health Department Duties and Requirements by Indiana Code (IC) & Indiana Administrative Code (IAC)\" (Revised October 2021) Prepared by the Indiana Local Health Department Managers Association and represents their analysis and views. This document is designed simply to guide local health departments in providing an outline of duties that are required (\"shall do\" or \"must do\") of local health departments in Indiana and those duties that are allowable (\"may do \") and may be conducted by choice by local health departments in Indiana. This was derived as a helpful tool - but has not been formally legally reviewed and is subject to change as needed. It is also subject to interpretation per locality and again, is me rely a guide. All sections denoted in blue font below are generalizations of whether or not a statute/rule is funded or unfunded (with \"funded\" meaning either by way of directly - provided state/federal funds or by the authority provided in the rules to allow a local health department to charge for the se rvices with a local ordinance). This may vary county -to-county based upon whether or not their budget is fully tax -based - in which case, these duties would technically not be considered unfunded as taxes could technically be considered to be funding them. It is merely listed as a tool for local discussion and mainly references whether or not duties are considered a state or federal unfunded mandate. ... In general, the following are statutorily -required duties that Indiana Local Health Departments must perf orm via Indiana Code or Indiana Administrative Code: General Rules Governing Local Health Departments and Boards of Health (Formation, Type, Meetings, etc.) IC 16 -19 and 16 -20 Boards of Health and Local Health Department Duties & Restrictions These cha pters go over what Executive Boards of Health must do and discusses budgets, annual reports, salaries, enforcement, etc. - basically prescribes the general duties of a local health department and their board. IC 16 -20-1-23 Inspection of private property by local health officer This is the section that provides guidance for how to seek consent for inspection of private property, what to do if denied entry, how to seek an inspection warrant, and what circumstances allow for urgent entry, etc. IC 16 -20-1-25 Unlawful conditions; abatement order; enforcement; providing false information IC 16 -20-1-26 Injunctive enforcement; legal representation of health authorities Vital Records/Birth/Death Collection, recording, filin g, and submission of Vital Statistics and all associated duties Appendices 114 FUNDED OR UNFUNDED: In general, local health departments have the statutory authority to and do charge fees for services for Vital Records associated duties, so this is not considered an unfunded mandate. IC 16 -20-1-17 (Vital Statistics; birth and death records) IC 16 -21-11-6 (Disposition by cremation or interment; costs; permits; confidential information - regarding a miscarried fetus) IC 16 -34-3-4 (Disposition by cremation or interment; permits; confidential information - regarding an aborted fetus) IC 16 -35-7 (Child Deat hs) IC 16 -37 (General Statutes regarding Vital Records) IC 16 -37-1-9 (Coroner's Continuing Education Fund) Unfunded Mandate IC 16 -38-2-7 (Release of Confidential Information - regarding cancer patients and information released by IDOH to local health departments) IC 16 -38-4 (Birth Problems Registry) IC 16 -38-6-7 (Releasing Confidential Information - regarding IDOH releasing information to local health officers about chronic disease patients) IC 16 -41-6-9 (Information on confidential part of birt h certificate - regarding HIV tests performed under certain conditions) IC 23 -14-31 (Cremation) IC 23 -14-57 (Disinterment, Disentombment and Disinurnment) -19-5 (Indiana Putative Father Registry) IC 31 -19-13 (New Birth Certificate Following Ado ption) IC 34 -28-2 (Change of Name) IC 36 -2-14 (County Coroner) IC 10 -13-5-11 (Indiana Clearinghouse for Information on Missing Children) 410 IAC 18 (Vital Records) Control of Disease Public Health Measures for the Prevention and Treatment of Disease as well as all required follow -up of Reportable Communicable Diseases FUNDED OR UNFUNDED: With the exception of certain IDOH -provided medications, large pandemics receiving federal fundin g initiatives such as H1N1, COVID -19, and some IDOH - provided STD testing, the performance of these duties is considered an unfunded mandate as no monies are provided to local health departments to perform these duties and they are often performed under eme rgency circumstances to protect the community. For many years, these services were provided completely free of charge in most local health departments (TB testing, TB treatment, STD testing, STD treatment, etc.). Some local health departments may now seek reimbursement from Medicaid/Medicare/Private Insurance, and some may have begun charging fees for some clinical services to begin to offset the costs of providing these services if local tax funding is falling short of covering all departmental costs. Larg e outbreaks of communicable diseases and the required responses, however, are still generally unfunded and take a large toll on local budgets. Further, all investigations of reportable diseases generally are considered just \"regular required\" duties for lo cal health departments. IC 16 -20-1-21 (Communicable disease control; powers) Appendices 115 IC 16 -20-1-24 (Epidemic control; powers) IC 16 -41 (Public Health Measures for the Prevention and Control of Disease --All General Communicable Disease Prevention Rules) 410 IAC 1 -2.2-5 (Reports to Local Health Officers regarding Communicable Disease) 410 IAC 1 -2.5 (Communicable Disease Reporting Rule) 410 IAC 2 -1 (Tuberculosis Control) 410 IAC 2 -2 (Payment for TB treatment under certain circumstances & Patient Movemen t/Transfers) 410 IAC 29 (Childhood Lead Poisoning) IC 16 -41-19 (Vaccination Provisions for Indigent Persons; payment and forms) 410 IAC 6 -9-5(b) (Agricultural Labor Camps; notification of communicable disease only) Food Protection Food Protection, I nspection, Sanitary Requirements, Food Handler Certification, Bed & Breakfast Establishments FUNDED OR UNFUNDED: In general, local health departments have the statutory authority to and do charge fees for services for Food Establishment Permitting and Ins pection -associated duties, so this is not considered an unfunded mandate. IC 16 -18-2-137 (Food Establishment Sanitary Requirements Exception) IC 16 -20-8 (Food Service Inspections) IC 16 -41-31 (Regulation of Lodging Facilities and Bedding Materials: Bed & Breakfast Establishments - these are the authorities IDOH has in this regard but defines some basic things) IC 16 -42 (Regulation of Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics) IC 16 -42-5 (Sanitary Food Req uirements for Food Establishments) 410 IAC 7 -15.5 (Bed & Breakfast Rule) 410 IAC 7 -22 (Food Handler Certification Rule) 410 IAC 7 -23 (Civil Penalties Rule) 410 IAC 7 -24 (Indiana Food Sanitation Rule) NOTE: HEA 1260 (in 2018) made changes to IDOH's hospital survey/inspection processes and resulted in the retail food inspection portion of accredited hospitals being passed down to local health departments to carry out starting 1/1/2019. Pollution Cont rol Monitoring and Regulation of Wastewater/Sewage Disposal FUNDED OR UNFUNDED: In general, local health departments have the statutory authority to and do charge fees for services for Pollution Control/Onsite Sewage System Permitting and Inspection -associated duties, so this is not considered an unfunded mandate . 410 IAC 6 -8.3 (Residential Sewage Disposal Rule) 410 IAC 6 -10.1 (Commercial On -Site Wastewater Disposal 410 IAC 6 -12 (Plan Review, Construction Permits, and Fees for Service) Appendices 116 IC 16 -41-25 (Health, Sanitation, and Safety: Residential Septic Systems, Required Lid Covering, Fill Soil, Notice Regarding Sewer Districts) IC 13 -26-5-2.5-2.6 (Septic tank soil absorption system exemption from Sewer Connection and Local Health Department Duties in this Regard) Vector Control Pest Control and Vector Abatement Programs FUNDED OR UNFUNDED: Direct funding is not provided to carry out these duties. It is sometimes considered covered under local tax monies allocated in local health department budgets. This section allows for the creation of a tax levy for these services, but the current tax caps laws likely would make this allowance moot. IC 16 -41-33 (Pest Control - General Provisions) IC 16 -41-34 (Pest Control - Eradication of Rats) Dwellings Unfit for Human Habitation General Health, Sanitation, Inspection and Safety Provisions FUNDED OR UNFUNDED: Direct funding is not provided to carry out these duties, however, it is a core duty of local health departments that is considered cove red under local tax monies allocated in local health department budgets. IC 16 -41-20 (Dwellings Unfit for Human Habitation - and associated duties, powers, orders to vacate, costs) Childhood Lead Poisoning Reporting, Monitoring, Case Management, and Pre ventive Procedures for Childhood Lead Poisoning FUNDED OR UNFUNDED: These duties are considered unfunded mandates. These duties originated with some available IDOH (CDC pass -through) funding many years ago when the legislation initially passed (and some local health departments applied for the funding), but those funds have gone away, and the duties remain. For some local health departments, this is a very large unfunded mandate. 410 IAC 29 (Lead Poisoning Rule) IC 16 -41-39.4 (Childhood Lead Poisoning, Sales of Consumer Products, Lead Safe Rules. Local Health Department Responsibilities) Railroad Camp Cars Requiring inspection and allowing licensi ng of railroad mobile camp cars FUNDED OR UNFUNDED: In general, local health departments have the statutory authority to and can charge fees for services for Railroad Camp Car Permitting and Inspection -associated duties if they perform these duties, so th is is not considered an unfunded mandate. It is worth noting that it is not a duty that seems to fit within the LOCAL health department duties since these trains move throughout the state and therefore it seems more fitting to be inspected at the STATE lev el. These are lengthy inspections and often involve inspectional aspects that are not related to public health but must be done (electrical, heating, mechanical, etc.). IC 8-9-10 (Indiana Camp Car Sanitary Rules) Appendices 117 IC 16 -10-3-4.4 (Mobile Camps - railroad s) 410 IAC 6 -14 (Indiana Camp Car Sanitary Rule) \"OTHER Miscellaneous Requirements\" IC 13 -23-16 (Unfunded Mandate) (LHD Reporting of Spills & Overfills from UST's) -- Local health departments have to pay to have these spills advertised for IDEM 318 IAC 1 (Unfunded Mandate) (Referred to as the \"Methamphetamine Rule\") -- Depending on the level of response and involvement each local health department engages in with identified meth/clandestine labs, this is a very large unfunded mandate. It is often difficult to think of charging fees for local health department services as most of the time those who are responsible for these meth labs are incarcerated, etc. This is a very difficult thing to enforce as well as capture any reimbursement for provision of services. IC 24 -5-13, sections 4.1, 16.1, 16.2, and 24 (Methamphetamine Labs in Vehicles) (Unfunded Mandate) 410 IAC 6 -7.1-16 and 7.1 -33 (Campgrounds / Temporary Campgrounds) IC 10 -14-3 (Emergency Mgmt. and Disaster Law - health related areas) IC 5-14-1.5 (Public Meetings - OPEN DOOR LAW) IC 5-14-3 (Access to Public Records) 410 IAC 24 -1 (Local Health Maintenance Funds and Fees for Service) IC 16 -20 (Throughout this statute, there are many duties LHDs \"may\" do - please read this section in full as it defines what must be done, what cannot be done, and what can be done.) IC 16 -20-1-25 (Investigation and Ordered Abatement of all conditions that may tr ansmit, generate, or promote disease; complaints) IC 16 -41-8 (Communicable Disease Confidentiality Requirements) IC 16 -41-19-2 (Unfunded Mandate) (Antitoxins and Vaccines - this section requires \"all counties, cities and towns\" --- doesn't specifically obligate the local health department, but it is usually construed that way --- to \"provide diphtheria, scarlet fever, and tetanus antitoxin and rabies vaccine to persons financially unable to purchase the antitoxin or vaccine, upon the application of a licensed physician.\" This is an old rule and work continues to get it removed. IC 16 -41-22-12 (Health, Sanitation, and Safety: Mass Gatherings) - see Section 12. IC 16 -41-22 (Health, Sanitation & Safety of Mass Gatherings - see IC 16 -41-22-12 as it relates to local health dept. responsibilities) IC 16 -41-30 Regulation of Lodging Facilities and Bedding Materials: Fresh Bedding for Hotel Guests IC 16 -41-34 (Unfunded Mandate) (Pest Control: Eradication of Rats, inspections) - note that there are both some required and allowed duties under this statute. (NOTE: There is an older provision in the statutes that allows for local health departments to request an increase to their ta x levy to cover the costs of this sort of program. However, when the tax cap laws took effect, this eliminated even the possibility of requesting this as taxes are now capped in most Appendices 118 counties and no new levies can be implemented without offsetting other taxes.) IC 16 -49-2 & 3 15 U.S.C. 8001 - 8008 (\"Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act\") - section 32(e) (Unfunded Mandate) (Establishing Local Child Fatality Review Teams) All public and semi -public pools and spas must comply with this rule relativ e to drain covers and local health departments who regulate pools OR receive complaints on this issue are, in general, responsible for ensuring compliance with this federal rule (this is because although the federal rule may designate stat es as the enforce rs of this rule, in Indiana, the State does not regulate swimming pools and usually defers to local health departments for this type of enforcement, therefore compliance with this act falls on any local health department who regulates swimming pools). In general, the following are duties Indiana Local Health Departments MAY/CAN perform but they are not required duties under the statutes/rules (and since these are not required, none are considered unfunded mandates per se, as conceivably fees could be charged to administer most of them, or you can choose not to do these duties). SEVERAL COUNTIES HAVE LOCAL ORDINANCES OR PROGRAMS THAT GOVERN THESE ACTIVITIES FOR THEIR AREA: ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL PROGRAMS WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN STATE STATUTES OR ADMINISTRATIVE RULES (therefore, if counties opt to pass local ordinances to do them, they generally adopt the state rules in that regard to enforce, but likely add to them for local needs): Syringe Services Programs (SSPs) IC 16 -41-7.5 (Communicable Disease: Syringe Service Programs) STD's, HIV Prevention (the clinical side of things - testing, treatment, partner services, etc.) IC 16 -41-15 (Communicable Disease: Prevention and Control of Sexually Transmitted Diseases) Mobile Homes IC 16 -41-27 (Health, Sanitation, & Safety of Mobi le Homes - see IC 16 -41-27-32) Pest/Vector/Mosquito/Rodent Control IC 16 -41-33 (Pest Control; Local and State Programs for Vector Abatement) Appendices 119 Swimming & Wading Pools 410 IAC 6 -2.1 (Swimming and Wading Pool Operations Rule) Tattoo & Body Piercing 410 IAC 1 -5 (Sanitary Operation of Tattoo Parlors & Body Piercing Establishments) Campgrounds and Bathing Beaches 410 IAC 6 -7.1 (Campgrounds and Bathing Beaches; inspections/investigations, testing) Youth Camps 6 -7.2 (Youth Camps; inspections/in vestigations, testing) OTHER: IC 16 -46 (State Health Grants and Programs to Local Boards of Health) IC 7.1 -5-12 (Smoking Ban) IC 8-2.1-27 (Transportation of Food) OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM ACTIVITIES THAT ARE DONE IN MANY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BY TH EIR OWN (or their elected official's own) CHOICE - BUT ARE NOT COVERED IN INDIANA STATUTE OR ADMINISTRATIVE RULES: Housing/Unfit for Human Habitation Complaints and Inspections Public Nuisance Ordinances Open Burning Enforcement Lead Risk Assessments, Mold Programs, etc. Massage Parlor Establishments Health -related programs for either education or attempting to lower the impacts of infant mortality, obesity, smoking, maternal child issues, etc. Refugee Care Travel Clinics - Immunizations, Medications, Counsel on International Travel & Disease Random Ordinances already in existence in cities/counties (not mentioned in current statutes or administrative rules) o Beekeeping Ordinances o CPR Ordinances o Patient Safety or other Safety -related Ordinances o Well Ordinances o Onsite Wastewater Management District Ordinance (Allen County only per IDEM requirements) Fee Ordinances - that cover a large portion of LHD operations (for permits, vital records, etc.) WIC Clinics for those who have this included in with their Health Department. Civil Surgeon Exam program s Appendices 120 ~Childhood and/or Adult Immunizations (although most LHDs offer some sort of immunization services, they are not generally required duties -- other than those required in accordance with IC 16 -41-19 or if they are associated with some form of outbreak w here IDOH/CDC prescribes a required response). In general, though, this is one of the unrequired, but core programs health departments offer across the state. ~Emergency Preparedness Planning and Response (other than any implied duties found under IC 10 -14-3) ~HOTELS/MOTELS/LODGING FACILITIES - although there are no specific statutes/rules pertaining the regulation of hotels/motels/lodging facilities, local health departments are responsible for the sanitation standards of those types of facilities and ge nerally do follow -up inspections upon receiving complaints from the public. Some counties have developed local ordinances to set forth standards, penalties and for outlining inspectional requirements, but most counties in Indiana do complaint -based inspect ions. ...
