Dr. Grayson will teach you how to get to the barriers to healing as well as to the basic original cause of an illness, physical or emotional. A doctor will not tell you what the cause of the diagnosis is, instead you will typically be told how to focus on repairing the symptom in a certain body part only. The underlying cause is not likely to be attended to, for it often lurks under the surface, requiring ongoing and relentless curiosity and the deep desire to know. While research has defined some of the origins of various illnesses, it most often does not get beyond the linear connection to something physical. And especially, there is rarely any attention given to identifying the barriers to health and healing. And alas, most physicians and other health care professionals are just not trained in this manner since it is rarely if ever included in traditional or naturopathic medical school curriculum, and little is presented in the curriculum in training psychotherapists. Your deeper healing may come more from embracing a quantum world view, a spiritual world view inspired by ancient wisdom traditions, or an unveiling of an unconscious psychological perspective. Growing numbers of self healers have found in their experience, as Dr. Grayson has found in his, that repeated colds, viruses, backaches and allergies are just not necessary! Nor are so many of our more serious and even life threatening illnesses inevitable and incurable! The painful experiences of childhood (developmental traumas) not only remain encoded in the limbic system and other parts of the body until cleared, but accumulate and weaken us emotionally and physically, distract us from spiritual growth, and cause painful and repetitive patterns in our minds and bodies. Talk therapy alone often rehearses and reinforces these traumas. We are then led to conclusions called \"core beliefs, which work like software, \"printing out\" confirmation in every area of our lives until cleared. These often crystalize into unproductive identities or bodily illnesses. Most of us say we want to be happy, successful, and healthy, but often have difficulty making these happen. It's as though we are trying to sail our boats, not knowing we are dragging several anchors. We can now use energetic methods to quickly identify these \"anchors\" or blocks, where they originated, and which method we can use to effectively clear them Find out what's happening in Ryewith free, real-time updates from Patch. You will Learn: - how Dr. Grayson has repeatedly done his own self healing Find out what's happening in Ryewith free, real-time updates from Patch. the purpose of all healing and why complete healing must start with healing the mind why we do not heal our body symptoms even when we say we want to get well. you will learn how to identify prevalent, but mostly unconscious barriers to healing, and quick effective ways of clearing them why we get sick: the powerful role of beliefs, traumas, thoughts, secondary gains, the tribal mind and family systems why the mind rules over genes why childhood traumas and stresses often predispose us to serious adult illnesses;effective ways of clearing the effects of these traumas; we need to continually clear effects of traumas and stresses; how to use powerful tools for creating health and happiness that anyone can use how to use subtle energies to promote healing of the mindbody. You will learn how to use meridian based therapies:EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), TAT (Tapas Accupressure Technique), Thought Field Therapy, chakra energy balancing techniques, variations on EMDR and creative visualization to promote healing insights from new discoveries in biology, quantum physics, brain scan studies, and horticulture, neuropsychology and the implications for healing five questions I ask myself when I get a physical symptom how to use muscle testing from applied kinesiology to identify barriers to healing, happiness, and success how your mind affects your body instantly. In the Quantum mind-body, the body is 99.999% empty space, meaning it is only 1/1000 of 1% matter, which is why our minds intervene so powerfully, positively and negatively how to use your body signals and symptoms to heal emotionally and spiritually as well as physically how to prevent or heal most colds, flus, viruses, headaches, backaches, and other common ailments as well as serious illnesses the roles of prayer, meditation, surrender and other spiritual practices in self healing the role of specialized rituals to focus consciousness for self healing Why Attend this Seminar? Make 2010 the year you harness and use the proven power of your mindbody to heal yourself and/or others of mental and physical pain! Brain scans and new sciences such as quantum physics show us that the mind is directly related when it comes to illness and suffering. Our thoughts are constantly communicating with every cell in our bodies either creating health or disease. Limited belief systems are inherent to human nature and as limited as most believe themselves to be, there is a surge of new data through research science which demonstrate that our limitations are self-created. Just as we create our limitations in what we believe our selves to be capable of, on the other end of the spectrum is that our power is infinite and is based upon scientific studies that teach us to reinforce our more positive and less limiting belief systems. Surveys and studies continually show that most human beings have built in barriers to healing and happiness. These can be identified and cleared. Many practitioners have found that this seminar helps them learn how to identify and heal the causes behind such chronic illnesses including: cancer, depression, Multiple Sclerosis, back pain, colitis, phobias, and many others, so that the physical components often times go away. Why would we willingly choose to continue to believe we are severely limited in our capacity to heal and better ourselves when we can choose to acknowledge ancient wisdom, new sciences, brain scans and quantum physics experiments that show we can access our own abilities by tapping into our atomic energetic fields to heal ourselves and others with tried and true methods? With time, everything advances, including technology. Why wouldn't we want to open our mind to the options available to us and our patients? Why not become aware of more effective ways to operate, function, and better our selves within the fields of psychotherapy, medicine and healing? The helping professions can now too also study new ways of adapting to the ever changing world, improving upon, quickening and quantifying their work. This seminar explores scientific advances in the field of psychotherapy and healing. To see some video clips of me explaining some of my work please go "}
