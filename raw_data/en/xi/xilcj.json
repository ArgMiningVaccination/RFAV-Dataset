During the colder months, often fraught with viruses, it's paramount that we nourish our bodies' nutrient stores and support the immune system. The right foods can provide essential nutrients that strengthen the body's defences and enhance overall well-being. In this blog post, we'll share our top five immune-boosting foods that are particularly beneficial for cancer patients and survivors. Let's dive in and discover how these foods can help you stay healthy and resilient this winter. Top 5 immune boosting foods to include in your diet daily: 1. Citrus Fruits: Citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruits, lemons, and limes are in season in winter, and packed with immune-boosting properties. We all now that citrus is rich in vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that helps support immune function and fights off harmful pathogens, but what's less known is that Vitamin C also plays a pivotal role in collagen production, which aids in wound healing and tissue repair - essential for cancer patients who have undergone surgery and chemotherapy. Enjoy whole citrus fruits as a snack, squeeze fresh lemon juice over salads or incorporate them into smoothies for a refreshing boost. 2. Dark Leafy Greens: Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are nutritional powerhouses that provide a wide range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are particularly high in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as folate and iron. Some of these foods also contain sulphur compounds that can enhance liver detoxification, perfect for post-treatment nutrition. These nutrients support the immune system and help fight inflammation with their high vitamin and mineral content, phenolic acids and flavanoid content. Add dark leafy greens to salads, saut\u00e9 them as a side dish, or blend them into soups and smoothies to maximise their benefits. 3. Berries: Berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, are not only delicious but also rich in antioxidants and phytochemicals. These compounds help protect the body against oxidative stress and strengthen the immune system. Berries are also high in fiber, which supports healthy digestion and helps to maintain a balanced gut microbiome. Enjoy them fresh as a standalone snack, add them to yogurt or oatmeal, or include them frozen in homemade smoothies for a burst of flavour and immune-boosting goodness. 4. Garlic: Garlic has been used for centuries for its medicinal properties, including immune-boosting benefits. It contains sulphur compounds, such as allicin, which have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions. These compounds help support the immune system by fighting off infections. These sulphur compounds are also important for liver support and detoxification. Incorporate fresh garlic into your cooking by adding it to stir-fries, sauces, or roasted vegetables. If raw garlic is too strong for you, consider using garlic powder or aged garlic extract supplements. 5. Yogurt and Fermented Foods: Probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi are excellent choices for supporting immune health. These foods contain beneficial bacteria that help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which play a crucial role in immune function. The gut microbiome influences the body's defence mechanisms and helps reduce inflammation. The microbiome also produces short-chain fatty acids from high-fibre foods that help to produce an anti-inflammatory response. Choose plain, unsweetened varieties of yogurt and fermented foods to avoid added sugars. Incorporate them into your daily routine as a snack or use them as a topping for salads or whole-grain bowls. Tips on incorporating the above Immune-Boosting Foods into your meals: - Start your day with a citrus fruit salad or a vitamin-packed smoothie. - Add dark leafy greens to soups, stews, or saut\u00e9 them as a side dish. - Snack on fresh berries or add them to yogurt, oatmeal, or salads. - Experiment with flavourful garlic in various recipes to enhance taste and health benefits: eg soups, stir fries, salad dressings, roasts. - Incorporate fermented foods as a side to your meals, for example a forkful of sauerkraut with meals.
