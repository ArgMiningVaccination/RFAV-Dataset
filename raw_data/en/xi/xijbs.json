AB - OBJECTIVE: To compared the therapeutic effect of a Chinese patent medicine Naoxintong Capsule (, NXT) and aspirin with adjusted-dose warfarin in Chinese elderly patients (over 65 years) with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and genetic variants of vitamin K reductase (VKORC1), who are at high-risk of thromboembolism. METHODS: A total of 151 patients, with NVAF and AA genotype of VKORC1-1639 (a sensitive genotype to warfarin) and a CHA2DS2-VASc clinical risk score of 2 or above, were chosen for this study. Patients were randomized into two groups and orally treated with a combination of aspirin (100 mg/day) and NXT (1.6 g thrice a day) or adjusted-dose warfarin [international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0). The primary end points including ischemic stroke and death as well as the secondary end points including hemorrhage events were followed up for at least 1 year. RESULTS: Baseline clinical data and the rates of primary end points were similar between groups. However, the rate of serious bleeding (secondary event) in the combination therapy group was lower than that in the adjusted-dose warfarin group NXT and warfarin displayed comparable rates of primary end point including ischemic stroke and all-cause death during the 1-year follow-up. However, as compared with warfarin, the combination therapy reduced the rate of serious bleeding. Therefore, aspirin combined with NXT might provide an alternative pharmacotherapy in preventing ischemic stroke for elderly patients with NAVF who cannot tolerate warfarin. (No. ChiCTR-TRC-13003596).

PG - 101904 LID - 10.1155/2015/101904 [doi] AB - We aimed to compare effectiveness of Wenxin Keli (WK) and sotalol in assisting sinus rhythm (SR) restoration from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) caused by hyperthyroidism, as well as in maintaining SR. We randomly prescribed WK (18 g tid) or sotalol (80 mg bid) to 91 or 89 patients. Since it was not ethical not to give patients antiarrhythmia drugs, no control group was set. Antithyroid drugs were given to 90 patients (45 in WK group, 45 in sotalol group); (131)I was given to 90 patients (46 in WK group, 44 in sotalol group). Three months later, SR was obtained in 83/91 or 80/89 cases from WK or sotalol groups (P = 0.762). By another analysis, SR was obtained in 86/90 or 77/90 cases from (131)I or ATD groups (P = 0.022). Then, we randomly assigned the successfully SR-reverted patients into three groups: WK, sotalol, and control (no antiarrhythmia drug was given) After twelve-month follow-up, PAF recurrence happened in 1/54, 2/54, and 9/55 cases, respectively. Log-Rank test showed significant higher PAF recurrent rate in control patients than either treatment (P = 0.06). We demonstrated the same efficacies of WK and sotalol to assist SR reversion from hyperthyroidism-caused PAF. We also showed that either drug could maintain SR in such patients.

PG - 613970 LID - 10.1155/2015/613970 [doi] AB - Background. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia. Several trials have suggested that acupuncture may prevent AF. However, the efficacy of acupuncture for AF prevention has not been well investigated. Therefore, we designed a prospective, two-parallel-armed, participant and assessor blinded, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial to investigate acupuncture in persistent AF (ACU-AF). Methods. A total of 80 participants will be randomly assigned to active acupuncture or sham acupuncture groups in a 1 : 1 ratio. Both groups will take the same antiarrhythmic medication during the study period. Patients will receive 10 sessions of acupuncture treatment once a week for 10 weeks. The primary endpoint is AF recurrence rate. Secondary endpoints are left atrium (LA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) changes in function and volume, and inflammatory biomarker changes. Ethics. This study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) of Kyung Hee University Hospital (number 1335-04). This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov NCT02110537.

These 4 factors were mainly localized at infected areas of the SA node area, R-&L-Atria & pulmonary veins at the L-atrium. PG - 297-333 AB - Lyme disease is found in a majority of people we tested. Once Borrelia Burgdorferi (B.B.) spirochete enters human body, it not only causes pain by infecting joints, but it also often enters the brain and the heart. Infection of brain can be quickly detected from the pupil and infection of the heart by ECGs non-invasively. By evaluating recorded ECGs of atrial fibrillation (AF), using U.S. patented non-invasive highly sensitive electromagnetic field (EMF) resonance phenomenon between 2 identical molecules or between a molecule and its antibody, we examined 25 different AF patients' ECGs and found the majority of them suffer from various degrees of B.B. spirochete infection in SA node areas, also in the right & left atria, and pulmonary vein near and around its junction at left atrium & lesser degrees of infection at the AV node & His Bundle. When B.B. infection reaches over 224-600ng or higher at these areas, AF often appears in the majority of all AF analyzed. In order to develop AF, the 4 abnormal factors must be present simultaneously: 1) B.B. infection must be increased to 224-600ng or higher, 2) Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) must be markedly reduced from normal value of less than 4ng to over 100-400ng, 3) A significant increase of Cardiac Troponin I from normal value of less than 3ng to over 12ng and 4) Taurine must also be markedly reduced from normal value of 4-6ng to 0.25ng. These 4 changes were mainly found only at infected sites of the SA node area, both atria and between the end of the T wave & the beginning of the SA node area, which corresponds to U waves at recorded ECG. Origin of the U wave is mainly due to abnormal electrical potential of pulmonary vein at L-atrium. If all 4 factors do not occur at the infection site, no AF will develop. In seemingly normal ECGs, if using this method, one can detect invisible B.B. infection in early stages. Long before AF appears, AF can be prevented by improved treatment with Amoxicillin 500ng 3 times/day + Taurine 175mg x 3 times/day, with or without EPA 180 mg & DHA 120 mg, to avoid serious current limitations in the use of Doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day, for 4 weeks.

PG - 245958 LID - 10.1155/2013/245958 [doi] AB - Objective. To evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of Wenxin Keli (WXKL), alone or combined with Western medicine, on P-wave dispersion (Pd) and maintenance of sinus rhythm for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). Methods. Seven major electronic databases were searched to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of WXKL, alone or combined with Western medicine, for PAF, with Pd or maintenance rate of sinus rhythm as the main outcome measure. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using criteria from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions, version 5.1.0, and analysed using RevMan 5.1.0 software. Results. Fourteen RCTs of WXKL were included. The methodological quality of the trials was generally evaluated as low. The results of meta-analysis showed that WXKL, alone or combined with Western medicine, was more effective in Pd and the maintenance of sinus rhythm, compared with no medicine or Western medicine alone, in patients with PAF or PAF complicated by other diseases. Seven of the trials reported adverse events, indicating that the safety of WXKL is still uncertain. Conclusions. WXKL, alone or combined with Western medicine, appears to be more effective in improving Pd as well as maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with PAF and its complications.

PG - 686-8 AB - OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference of clinical efficacy in the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) between acupuncture combined with Wenzin granule and simple Wenxin granule therapy. METHODS: Sixty hospitalized cases of PAF were randomized into a medication group and a medication--acupuncture group. Wenxin granule was given to the patients in the two groups 3 times a day, 9 g each time, 4 weeks as a treatment course. Meanwhile, acupuncture was added to the medication--acupuncture group at bilateral Neiguan (PC 6), Shenmen (HT 7), Ximen (PC 4) with uneven reinforcing-reducing manipulation every 15 min, 1 min each time. The needle was retained for 30 minutes. The acupuncture was given once daily for continuously 4 weeks. The therapeutic efficacy of the two groups was assessed after treatment. METHODS: In the medication+acupuncture group, 18 cases were markedly effective, 10 cases were effective and 2 cases were failed, the total effective rate was 93.3%; in the medication group, 15 cases were markedly effective, 8 cases were effective and 7 cases were failed, the total effective rate was 76.7%. There were statistical significances in clinical efficacy between the two groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with Wenxin granule has a better effect than simple Wenxin granule therapy in the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

PG - 327-30 LID - 10.1136/acupmed-2013-010380 [doi] AB - A 62-year-old patient with chronic bronchitis had treatment-resistant atrial fibrillation. Electrical cardioversion was performed, but sinus rhythm (SR) lasted only for some minutes. Administration of amiodarone was withheld in favour of a course of acupuncture treatment in order to increase the success rate of a second attempt of electrical cardioversion. After two acupuncture treatments, spontaneous conversion to SR occurred. Relapses into atrial fibrillation in the following five winters, associated with attacks of bronchitis, also responded to acupuncture. The mechanisms of action of the acupuncture treatment and the value of this integrated approach to treatment are discussed.

PG - 173-8 AB - OBJECTIVE: To confirm the long-term outcomes of stroke patients and determine predicting factors for death, recurrence of vascular events and poor outcome (either recurrence or death) after the use of combined TCM therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective hospital-based cohort study and was performed in the First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Tianjin. All subjects with stroke consecutively admitted to an inpatient ward of the Acupuncture Department from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2008 were retrospectively followed through one year. The main outcomes were either a recurrence of vascular events, mortality or both. Risk factors were recorded from medical records. Multivariate regression models were used to analyze predictors. The following independent variables were used: age, gender, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, carotid arterial lesions and history of stroke. RESULTS: Four-hundred and five patients were included. The 1-year mortality rate was 11.11%. 23.70% of the patients had a recurrent vascular event, and 30.86% suffered a poor outcome. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that previous stroke, and advanced age were predictors of death within one year, Recurrence of vascular events was associated with carotid arterial lesions, history of diabetes and previous stroke. Long-term poor outcome was predicted by advanced age, history of diabetes, and previous stroke. CONCLUSION: Age, previous stroke, carotid arterial lesions and diabetes history seem to have different impacts on the three outcomes within one year. Our findings provide important data for planning future hospital register studies of stroke patients in TCM hospitals.

PG - 16-22 AB - CONTEXT: To summarize and evaluate the available evidence from controlled clinical trials of tai chi (TC) exercise for patients with heart disease. SEARCH METHODS: Fourteen databases were searched up to November 2010 with the terms tai chi, taichi, tai ji, taiji, taijichuan, cardiac, heart, coronary, myocardial, and atrial fibrillation in the title, abstract, or key words. No language restrictions were imposed. The quality and validity of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were evaluated using the Jadad Scale. The strength of the evidence for all included studies was evaluated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: Nine studies including 5 RCTs and 4 nonrandomized controlled clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Three studies examined the effectiveness of TC exercise for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), and 6 studies examined the effectiveness of TC exercise among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Overall, these studies demonstrated favorable effects of TC exercise for the patients with heart disease.

PG - 109-14 AB - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the statement on randomized controlled trials on Wenxin granule for treatment of atrial fibrillation and to judge whether those trials could offer high quality evidence or not, thus improve design level and quality. METHOD: RCTs were searched from home and abroad about atrial fibrillation treated with Wenxin granule, which reported before October, 2010. Jadad scale and CONSORT statement were used. RESULT: There were 66 RCTs retrieved that met inclusion criteria. Using Jadad rating scale, only 2 literatures gain score 4 and 1 literature gains score 3, 54 literatures gain score 2, 7 literatures gain score 1, 2 literatures gain score 0. Only 2 literatures described random number table as the method of grouping. None of the RCTs was reported the allocation concealment. Only 1 literature was used blinding. Fifty-nine literatures were mentioned the lost to follow-up conditions. According to the CONSORT standards, only six literatures (9.1%) mentioned the method of generating the random sequence. Four literatures (6.1%) were quasi-random. Nineteen literatures (28.8%) had inclusion criteria. (9.1%) had the follow-up record. Fifty one literatures (77.3%) described the adverse events. None had the estimation of the sample size, intention-to-treat analysis and stratified analysis. None had the ethical approval or informed consent. CONCLUSION: The quality of clinical trials of Wenxin granule in treating atrial fibrillation needs to be improved.

PG - 255-67 AB - The objective of this study was to assess evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of Chinese qigong exercise in rehabilitative programs among cardiac patients. Thirteen databases were searched through to November 2010, and all controlled clinical trials on Chinese qigong exercise among patients with chronic heart diseases were included. For each included study, data was extracted and validity was assessed. Study quality was evaluated and summarized using both the Jadad Scale and the criteria for levels of evidence. Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one non-randomized controlled clinical trial (CCT) published between 1988 and 2007 met the inclusion criteria. In total, these studies covered 540 patients with various chronic heart diseases including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarct, valve replacement, and ischemic heart disease. Outcome measures emerged in these studies included subjective outcomes such as symptoms and quality of life; and objective outcomes such as blood pressure, ECG findings, and exercise capacity, physical activity, balance, co-ordination, heart rate, and oxygen uptake. Overall, these studies suggest that Chinese qigong exercise seems to be an optimal option for patients with chronic heart diseases who were unable to engage in other forms of physical activity; however, its efficacy and effectiveness in cardiac rehabilitation programs should be further tested.

(saffron) on (i) the basic and rate-dependent electrophysiological properties of the AV node, (ii) remodeling of the AV node during experimental atrial fibrillation (AF) and (iii) the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the effects of saffron on the AV node. Stimulation protocols in isolated AV node were used to quantify AV nodal recovery, facilitation and fatigue in four groups of rabbits (n = 8-16 per group). In addition, the nodal response to AF was evaluated at multiple cycle lengths and during AF. Saffron had a depressant effect on AV nodal rate-dependent properties; further, it increased Wenckebach block cycle length, functional refractory period, facilitation and fatigue (p < 0.05). A NO-synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) prevented the depressant effects of saffron on the AV node (p < 0.05). Saffron increased the zone of concealment in experimental AF (p < 0.05). The present research showed, for the first time, established electrophysiological remodeling of the AV node during AF by saffron. Saffron increased the AV nodal refractoriness and zone of concealment. These depressant effects of saffron were mediated by endogenous NO. CI - Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

PG - 20 LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-11-20 [doi] AB - BACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety and physical unfitness have been shown to have adverse effects on recovery from cardiac surgery. This study involving cardiac surgery patients was primarily aimed at assessing the feasibility of delivering physical conditioning and stress reduction programs within the public hospital setting. Secondary aims were to evaluate the effect of these programs on quality of life (QOL), rates of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) and length of stay (LOS) in hospital. METHODS: Elective patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft and/or valve surgery at a public hospital in Melbourne, Australia were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either holistic therapy (HT) or usual care (UC). HT consisted of a series of light physical exercise sessions together with a mental stress reduction program administered in an outpatient setting for the first two weeks after placement on the waiting list for surgery. A self-administered SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure QOL and hospital records to collect data on LOS and rate of postoperative AF. RESULTS: The study population comprised 117 patients of whom 60 received HT and 57 received UC. Both programs were able to be delivered within the hospital setting but ongoing therapy beyond the two week duration of the program was not carried out due to long waiting periods and insufficient resources. HT, as delivered in this study, compared to UC did not result in significant changes in QOL, LOS or AF incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative holistic therapy can be delivered in the hospital setting, although two weeks is insufficient to provide benefits beyond usual care on QOL, LOS or postoperative AF. Further research is now required to determine whether a similar program of longer duration, or targeted to high risk patients can provide measurable benefits. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was conducted as part of a larger study and according to the principles contained in the CONSORT statement 2001.

The knowledge of diseases and Western medicine treatment can be acquired by literature retrieval through PICO question, while searching by CAM topics may provide evidence for Chinese medicine (CM). Thus the author held that literature retrieval through both PICO question and CAM topics was an ideal evidence-based practice method for integrative Chinese and Western medicine (ICWM). However, since the standard in CM evidence hierarchy is still under study, the value of the CAM thematic retrieval method remains very limited. In the future, studies on the definition and hierarchy of CM evidences and the herb-drug interaction between Western and Chinese medicine during a combination therapy should be strengthened to improve the status of ICWM evidence-based practice.

PG - 453-6 LID - 10.1007/s11655-010-0540-y [doi] AB - OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic efficacy and safety of amiodarone combined with Shenmai Injection () on atrial fibrillation. METHODS: A total of 351 patients with atrial fibrillation caused by cardiovascular diseases and idiopathic atrial fibrillation were assigned to amiodarone group (control group, 128 cases) and amiodarone combined with Shenmai Injection group (treatment group, 223 cases). The patients in the control group received intravenous injection of 150 mg amiodarone in 10 min, followed by intravenous drip infusion at 1 mg /min and 6 h later at 0.5 mg /min until 48 h or cardioversion. The patients in the treatment group received the same treatment of amiodarone, while in addition, they received an injection of Shenmai Injection of 100 mL simultaneously. Blood pressure, ventricular rate, and cardioversion were observed. RESULTS: The total efficiency rate was 98% (control group) and 99% (treatment group) (P>0.05). The mean ventricular rate decreased 23% and 31% in the control group and the treatment group, respectively (P<0.05). The mean cardioversion time of the two groups was 570+/-211 min and 351+/-123 min, respectively (P<0.05). Only mild side effects were observed in both groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with amiodarone, amiodarone combined with Shenmai Injection takes effect more quickly with low side effects on the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

PG - 965-74 LID - 10.1089/acm.2007.0765 [doi] AB - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review and evaluate published evidence on the use of omega-3 fatty acid in the prevention and treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Postulated mechanisms of the antiarrhythmic acid are discussed. DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed articles/abstracts published in English language were identified from MEDLINE and Current Content databases (both 1966 to May 15, 2008) using the search terms fish oil, omega-3 fatty acid, sudden death, ventricular arrhythmia, and atrial fibrillation. Citations from available articles were also reviewed for additional references. Abstracts presented at recent professional meetings are also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Observational studies and interventional clinical studies published on omega-3 fatty acid or fish consumption and atrial or ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are selected. The design and results of the studies are evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain the antiarrhythmic effect of omega-3 fatty acid. It is believed that omega-3 fatty acid has an indirect effect on the autonomic nervous system, inhibits the fast, voltage-dependent sodium and L-type calcium channels, restores a favorable omega-6 fatty acid/omega-3 fatty acid balance, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. While the majority of observational evidence demonstrated that increased consumption of omega-3 fatty acid was associated with reduction in risk of sudden cardiac death, in ventricular arrhythmia, there was evidence suggesting that omega-3 fatty acid in patients experiencing nonischemic ventricular arrhythmia may be proarrhythmic. Other studies demonstrated a neutral effect. In terms of management of atrial fibrillation, short-term small-scale studies demonstrated that the use of omega-3 fatty acid preoperatively may reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, such observations were not consistent with those reported from retrospective cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of omega-3 fatty acid before it can be routinely recommended for the management of arrhythmia.

PG - 24-32 AB - CONTEXT: The use of complementary therapies in conjunction with conventional care has great potential to address patient pain, complication rates, and recovery time. Few studies of such therapies have been conducted in hospital settings where some of the most stressful procedures are performed on a regular basis. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that patients receiving healing touch (HT) would see improved outcomes. DESIGN: Patients were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: no intervention, partial intervention (visitors), and an HT group. SETTING: This study was conducted in an acute-care hospital in a large metropolitan area. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing first-time elective coronary artery bypass surgery were invited to participate. There were 237 study subjects. INTERVENTION: HT is an energy-based therapeutic approach to healing that arose out of nursing in the early 1980s. HT aids relaxation and supports the body's natural healing process. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This study consisted of 6 outcome measures: postoperative length of stay, incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, use of anti-emetic medication, amount of narcotic pain medication, functional status, and anxiety. RESULTS: Analysis was conducted for all patients and separately by inpatient/outpatient status. Though no significant decrease in the use of pain medication, anti-emetic medication, or incidence of atrial fibrillation was observed, significant differences were noted in anxiety scores and length ofstay. All HT patients showed a greater decrease in anxiety scores when compared to the visitor and control groups. In addition, there was a significant difference in outpatient HT length of stay when compared to the visitor and control groups.

PG - 51-6 AB - A 72 year old female with a main complaint of severe post-herpetic neuralgia and a secondary complaint of atrial fibrillation (AF) received two series of acupuncture treatments totalling 20 treatments over a four month period. Her standard medical treatment remained unchanged. The primary focus of the acupuncture was pain relief; however, two acupuncture points (PC6, SP4) were included in both treatment series because of possible effects on both costal or chest pain and cardiac arrhythmias, according to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) teaching and limited research. As recorded by her pacemaker, estimated weekly episodes of AF in the patient decreased significantly, and percentage time in AF decreased with borderline statistical significance, from the pretreatment estimates during the second series of treatments (weekly AF episode estimates: pretreatment=71.4; estimates=-12.6, 95% CI 0.9 to -26.0, P=0.08). The pain levels were also significantly reduced following the acupuncture treatment series by more than 67%. Further studies are warranted to further explore these observations of a possible effect of acupuncture on both atrial fibrillation and post-herpetic neuralgia.

PG - 49-54 AB - Generally, heart failure at the stable stage can be treated mainly with TCM drugs. Cardiac insufficiency of degree I and II can be simply treated with Chinese drugs. However, the western medicine ACEI is suggested to be used at the same time. For heart failure of degree III, measures of the western medical treatment should be adopted accordingly, such as the use of diuretics or Digoxin to control atrial fibrillation; beta-receptor blockers to increase the density of beta-receptor on the depleted myocardial cell membrane, so as to increase the sensitivity of the myocardial cells to CA, and effectively prevent the fatal ventricular fibrillation. At the acute aggravation stage of cardiac insufficiency, the inducing factors should be first eliminated to control the condition as soon as possible; and at the critical moment, modern medicine should be used. In case of acute pulmonary edema, emergency treatment should be given to save the patient's life. When the acute pulmonary edema is alleviated, Chinese drugs can be used, based on the TCM syndrome differentiation, mainly for removing the pathogenic fluid retention, and restoring the heart-qi and heart-yang.

PG - 96-8 AB - OBJECTIVE: To probe the feasibility of acupuncture in conversion of paroxymal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. METHODS: Eighty cases of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter were randomly divided into 2 groups, a treatment group and a control group, 40 cases in each group. The treatment group were treated with acupuncture at Neiguan (PC 6), Shenmen (HT 7), Danzhong (CV 17) and others, and the control group with intravenous injection of amiodarone. The cardiac rhythms and side effects were observed in the two groups. RESULTS: The total effective rate of 85.0% in the treatment group was better than 67.5% in the control group (P < 0.01). The average conversion time was (39.6 +/- 13.7) min in the treatment group and (50.1 +/- 14.8) min in the control group with a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.01). No adverse effect was found in the treatment group. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture is a safe and effective therapy for conversion of paroxymal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

PG - 582-5 AB - OBJECTIVE: We report on the case of a patient with spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) after spinal manipulative therapy and review features of reported cases of a similar nature. CLINICAL FEATURES: The patient was undergoing Coumadin anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation and presented to the chiropractor complaining of a stiff neck. After cervical manipulation, he developed paresthesia in both feet, progressing to motor deficits in all 4 extremities. He required a laminectomy and evacuation of a clot indenting the spinal cord. RESULTS: Review of the literature revealed 7 reported cases of SEH after manipulation; 5 patients underwent cervical manipulation and 1 patient received Coumadin therapy. CONCLUSION: Practitioners of spinal manipulative therapy should be aware of SEH as a possible complication of manipulation in patients at risk and should exercise caution in the care of patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy.

PG - 445-8 AB - OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of the combined use of amiodarone and Wenxin Granule (WXG) in auricular fibrillation (AF) conversion and its safety. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-four patients, in whom AF lasted for less than 1 year, were enrolled and randomly assigned into two groups, 112 in each group. Patients in the treated group were treated with WXG and amiodorane and the others in the control group were orally administered with amiodarone alone. The accumulative conversion rate of AF and adverse reaction were monitored during the 6-month observation period. RESULTS: Six-month observation was completed in 109 cases in the treated group and 107 in the control group, while 3 cases and 5 cases in the two groups were dropped out respectively. The difference of accumulative AF conversion rates between the two groups become significant early after one month medication (P < 0.05), and was 65.1% and 47.7% respectively after 6-month of treatment (P < 0.05). Inter-group significant difference was also shown in the aspects of average conversion time, dosage of amiodarone required and the occurrence of adverse reaction (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Combined use of WXG and amiodarone has a better effect in improving conversion rate of AF, shortening conversion time and decreasing the required dosage of amiodarone in treating AF as compared with the treatment with amiodarone alone, and by which the adverse reaction of long-term using amiodarone could be avoided.

PG - 35-8 AB - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) on fibrosis of atrial tissue and atrial fibrillation in a canine model of congestive heart failure (CHF) induced by ventricular tachypacing. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy mongrel dogs were randomly divided into three groups, which were normal control group, untreated group and TMP-treated group. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was induced by burst of atrial pacing, after the canine model of CHF was established. The atrial tissues were sampled and stained with Mallory's trichromic stains, then the fibrosis in the atrial tissues was analyzed. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was evaluated by echocardiography. The levels of angiotensin II (PIIINP)ilaminin (LN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) in peripheral blood were examined by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: The LVEF was significantly decreased in the untreated group as compared with that in the normal control group (P<0.01), while the frequencies of AF and sustaining AF were significantly increased and the AF duration was obviously prolonged in the untreated group as compared with those in the normal control group (P<0.01). The fibrosis degree in the left or right atrial tissue in the untreated group was more serious than that in the normal control group (P<0.01). The AF duration was positively correlated with the fibrosis degree in the left atrial tissue (r=0.84, P=0.018). The levels of AngII, ALD, PIIINP and HA in peripheral blood were significantly higher in the untreated group than those in the normal control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The level of AngII was positively correlated with the level of ALD in peripheral blood (r=0.759, P=0.048). The LVEF and the frequency of sustaining AF were both significantly improved in the TMP-treated group as compared with those in the untreated group (P<0.05). The fibrosis in the left or right atrial tissue in the untreated group was more serious than that in the untreated group (P<0.01). The levels of AngII and PIIINP in peripheral blood were also markedly higher in the TMP-treated group than those in the untreated group (P=0.05, P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Tetramethylpyrazine has the effect of reducing the fibrosis degree of atrial tissue in dogs with CHF, and this efficacy may be related to the mechanism of decreasing the frequency of AF and shortening the AF duration.

PG - 852-5 AB - In this paper, literature about adverse reaction induced by Puerarin injection published in recent years were reviewed and analyzed. It was reported that Puerarin injection can not only induce adverse reactions on multiple systems, such as immune, blood, urinary, digestive and cardiovascular system, but so far as to cause death. Therefore, it should be administered rationally and strictly according to the direction and the course of medication should be rigorously monitored to prevent the occurrence of adverse reactions.

PG - 455-7, an alkaloid of Corydalis turtschaninovii. Some animal experiments had demonstrated that Rotundium had a good antiarrhythmic effect in blocking the calcium channel and that it was a class IV antiarrhythmic agent, similar to that of Bepridil in literatures. This is a clinical report of Rotundium (oral given) on an atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. The therapeutical results were evaluated by 24 hours ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and ECG. The results showed that the effective rate of Rotundium on paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and sustained atrial fibrillation of 45 mm (left atrium diameter) or more was 30%, while LAD of less than 45 mm was 80% (P < 0.01). Among 8 cases' duration of AF were 6 months or more, 3 cases were effective, the effective rate 37.5%, while among 10 cases' duration of AF were less than 3 weeks, 3 cases were converted to sinus rhythm, 5 cases were effective. There was a significant difference between two groups. Age and sex exerted no effect on efficacy. During taking Rotundium, blood pressure had no apparent changes and no severe side effects were found. The results showed that Rotundium is an effective, safe new drug to treat AF, especially in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The antiarrhythmic mechanism of Rotundium might be related to its prolonging of the effective refractory period of atrial and atrioventricular node.
