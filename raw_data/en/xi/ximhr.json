Since ancient times, plants have been valued for theirmedicinal properties and, many cultures still rely onplants as their major source of medicine. Many cul-tures, including our own, have a rich history of plant-based medicine. Often you may hear the termsphytomedicine, complementary medicine, alternativemedicine or herbal medicine used. Extracts from thesemedicinal plants as well as whole plant forms havebeen used to soothe and to heal a wide variety ofailments. Recently herbs have been used to protect against chronic disease. DSHEA Herbal medicines represent a rapidly growing seg- ment of the natural products market. Congress passedthe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in1994 (DSHEA, pronounced \"D-shay\". This act recog-nized the role that dietary supplements (which includeherbal medicines) can play in health promotion andthe prevention of chronic disease. This legislation de- fined dietary supplements, addressed safety issuesand provided a mechanism for monitoring safety.DSHEA also called for good manufacturing practicesto be used in producing dietary supplements. It setguidelines for regulating health claims and the label-ing of dietary supplements. This act also establishedthe Commission on Dietary Supplement Labeling todevelop the supplement facts label that is now in place, and created the Office of Dietary Supplements. Safety and Purity In enacting DSHEA, Congress specifically defined dietary supplements as distinct from food and drugs.DSHEA required outside comprehensive monitoringby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Bothconsumers and health care professionals are con-cerned about whether herbal products are safe. DSHEAdoes not require the extensive premarket approval ofthe FDA that a prescription drug requires. It doesmaintain the FDA's authority to protect the public fromunsafe products. However, the burden of proof that adietary supplement is unsafe, is now shifted to thegovernment. DSHEA also maintains the FDA's right to establish good manufacturing practices (GMPs), whichare standard for the pharmaceutical industry and felt to be a key to product purity and safety. German Commission E /G32/G32/G32 Much of current Western herbal medicine is based upon European phytomedicine. In Europe, herbal medi- cines are widely used and closely monitored for safetyand efficacy. Germany, in particular, has been a leader in estab-lishing regulations regarding herbal medicines. In1974, scientific commissions were established withinthe German Federal Health Agency to review variouscategories of drugs. Commission E is the interdiscipli-nary commission of scientists and health professionalscharged with reviewing herbal medicines. In its review,the commission considers traditional use; chemicaldata; clinical, physicians' unpublished pro-prietary data from manufacturers to determine thesafety and effectiveness of each herbal medicine. It thendevelops monographs for informing the public of itsfindings. These monographs have recently been trans-lated into English and are a useful tool for other countries attempting to establish high standards for herbal medicines.2 The University of Arizona Cooperative ExtensionHerbal Medicine Explosion There has been an explosion in the number of herbal products available to consumers since the passage ofDSHEA. The following information and practical tipswill help you understand what's available and helpyou sort through the dizzying array of products. Herbal medicines are often referred to as herbs or botanicals. Technically, the term \"botanical\" includesall parts of the plant that have medicinal value, such asthe roots and rhizomes in addition to the leaves, stemsand flowers. Whereas \"herb\" refers only to leafy plantsthat don't have woody stems. The term \"herbal medi-cine\" perhaps more accurately conveys the intendedpurpose of the herb, but in reality, you will hear all three terms used interchangeably. Buying Tips When buying herbals, how do you know which brands and products have the highest quality? Howdo you know which products truly contain what theyclaim? \"Natural\" does not necessarily mean \"safe\". Herb- als are essentially dilute drugs and should be usedwith the same care and caution as prescription medica-tions. Beware that contamination, mislabeling, andmisidentification still can be a problem. Here are fivetips to help you choose the best herb brands. \u007fLook for herbal extracts that are standard- ized . The U.S.P. mark is a clear sign that the manufacturer is following U.S. harmacopoeiastandards. \u007fSelect products that have been tested . The label will usually say if the brand has under- gone scientific testing. \u007fChoose a brand that adheres to higher manu- facturing standards than are required . All herbal product manufacturers have to followstandards established for food processing(Food \"Good Manufacturing Practices\" orGMP's). \u007fBuy only single-herb products that clearly show how much of the herb each dose has.Some products are mixtures of several herbswith inadequate doses of each. \u007fBeware of claims that sound too good to be true. Use your common sense . If a claim pounds outrageous to you, trust your instinct.No one herbal product can possibly address awide spectrum of health concerns.More scientific research is underway to help identify the truly useful herbal products.Pharmaceutical companies have the money toconduct research to de termine the benefits and risks of their herbal products. Herb and drug interactions - What youshould know. Although \"natural,\" and therefore popularly consid- ered harmless, herbal supplements contain active in-gredients that may not safely mix with prescriptionor over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Tell your doctor about any herbal supplements you take. In addition, some medical problems may increase your risk of adverse effects if you take herbal products.Talk to your doctor before taking any herbal products ifyou're pregnant or nursing or have any of the follow-ing medical conditions: \u007f High gland\u007f History of stroke Herbals and Surgery Herbal supplements can be just as dangerous as prescription and OTC drugs when it comes to theirinteraction with anesthesia. Be sure to tell your doctorabout any drugs - including herbal supplements - thatyou're taking (and how much you're taking) as soon aspossible if you're anticipating any surgery. According tothe American Society of Anesthesiologists, the followingherbs can affect heart rate and blood pressure: \u007f Ginsing - May cause rapid heartbeat and increase blood pressure. \u007f Goldenseal - May cause or worsen high blood pressure. \u007f Ephedra - May elevate blood pressure and heart rate. Ephedra commonly is used as anappetite suppressant. \u007f Licorice - may increase blood pressure. This herb isn't to be confused with candy licorice,which contains little or no actual licorice.Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glare) commonly isused to treat stomach pain.The University of Arizona Cooperative Extension 3 And, the following herbals may increase you risk of bleeding. \u007f Garlic \u007f Ginger\u007f Ginkgo\u007f Feverfew Stop taking herbal supplements at least 2 to 3 weeks before surgery to allow them to clear from your body . If this isn't possible, bring the herbal product in itsoriginal container to the hospital so the anesthesiolo-gist knows exactly what you're taking.
