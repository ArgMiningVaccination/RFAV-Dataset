However, all registered students can use The Ashe Center. [Waiver students](/insurance/benefits/waiving-uc-ship) are classified as Non-SHIP in our system, and can always access care at The Ashe Center, but the fees for their visit will differ from students who have UCSHIP. Learn About Fees & Eligiblity All currently registered UC students can access services at The Ashe Center. Students from other UC campuses must provide current proof of registration. In addition, students who have purchased the non-registered voluntary UC SHIP and UCLA students who were registered in the previous academic term are also eligible to access services at The Ashe Center. Please note: Because of the nature of health insurance reimbursement rates, prices are subject to change without notice. We do our best to keep this page updated and maintain transparency in our pricing. If you have questions, please call The Ashe Center Billing Inquiry line at [310-206-0947](tel:+13102060947).
