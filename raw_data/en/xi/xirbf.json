Gaffen IL-17 was discovered nearly 30 yr ago, but it has only been recently appreciated that a key function of this cytokine is to orchestrate cellular and organismal metabolism. Indeed, metabolic regulation is integrated into both the physiological and the pathogenic aspects of IL-17 responses. Thus, understanding the interplay between IL-17 and downstream metabolic processes could ultimately inform therapeutic opportunities for diseases involving IL-17, including some not traditionally linked to this cytokine pathway. Here, we discuss the emerging pathophysiological roles of IL-17 related to cellular and organismal metabolism, including metabolic regulation of IL-17 signal transduction. Introduction IL-17A, referred to here as IL-17, is the founding cytokine of IL-17family that includes five other members, IL-17B -F(Monin and Gaffen, 2018 ). IL-17 is best known as a host-defensive cytokine at barrier mucosal tissues, with essential roles in immunity to fungi and other extracellular pathogens ( Conti and Gaffen, 2010 ; Conti et al., 2009 ;Conti et al., 2016 ;Verma et al., 2017 ). IL-17 also drives inflammation in a variety of autoimmune pathologies(McGeachy et al., 2019 ;Veldhoen, 2017 ). Consequently, we have witnessed an effective application of IL-17/Th17 cell basic biologyresearch discoveries to treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis,ankylosing spondylitis, etc. Additional drugs targeting the IL-17/Th17 cell pathway are in preclinical development ( Prinz et al., 2020 ;Vitiello and Miller, 2020 ;McGeachy et al., 2019 ). Never- theless, surprising new aspects of IL-17 biology continue to bediscovered, indicating that our overall understanding of thiscytokine system remains incomplete. The metabolism-modulating activity of IL-17 is a relatively new feature of the events driven by this cytokine ( Fig. 1 ). An intimate association between the immune and metabolic sys-tems has emerged on many fronts, especially studies of meta- bolic syndrome where inflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue are linked to insulin resistance and related impairments(Makowski et al., 2020 ;Hotamisligil et al., 1993 ;Mathis and Shoelson, 2011 ). Paralleling immune regulation of the meta- bolic system, metabolism of immune cells themselves is highlyregulated. \"Immunometabolism \"refers to two complementary facets of these interactions. The first relates to cellular metab-olism, i.e., how metabolic regulation within immune cells leads to different cell fates and function (e.g., activation, proliferation, and differentiation; Gaber et al., 2017 ;O'Neill et al., 2016 ). Thesecond focuses on the effect of inflammation and immune re- sponses on the control of systemic metabolism (e.g., adipogen-esis; Mathis, 2019 ;Troha and Ayres, 2020 et al., 2018 ;Hotamisligil, 2017a ). Therefore, this fusion between immunity and metabolism has broadened our understanding of connections between autoimmune and metabolic diseases. In mediating immunity to infections, IL-17 is expressed only transiently. However, in several chronic inflammatory and au-toimmune diseases, IL-17 persists long term, and its capacity toinfluence metabolic syndrome may have severe consequences(McGeachy et al., 2019 ). In both settings, growing literature points to a role for IL-17 in cellular and organismal metabolism.At a cellular level, IL-17 -mediated metabolic regulation pro- motes cell proliferation, a process that has been described in epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and stem cells to coordinate tissuerepair and wound healing ( Lee et al., 2015 ;Song et al., 2015 ; MacLeod et al., 2013 ;Chen et al., 2019 ). In addition, IL-17 pro- motes proliferation and survival ), which support IL-17 -mediated inflammation in arthritis and models of multiple sclerosis, among other con- ditions ( Yu et al., 2018 ;Majumder et al., 2019 ;Kim et al., 2017 ). Moreover, certain cellular metabolites (e.g., O'Neill and 2019 ), influence Gaffen, ;Kohlgruber et al., 2018 ;Hu et al., 2020 ;Okamoto et al., 2012 ;Madhur et al., 2010 ;Wilson et al., 2010 ). Elevated levels of IL-17 are de- tected in numerous metabolic disease settings, including obesity ( Sumarac-Dumanovic et al., 2009 ;Winer et al., 2009 ), diabetes ( Arababadi et al., 2010 ;Marwaha et al., 2010 ), and ............................................................................................................................... ..............................................

Moreover, some IL-17 -driven conditions (e.g., psoriasis) constitute a major risk for metabolic syndrome ( Davidovici et al., 2010 ;Azfar and Gelfand, 2008 ). In this review, we outline the current view of metabolic pathways that underlie IL-17 function, -target cells to metabolic homeostasis or diseases mediated by an IL-17 response. Changes in cellular metabolismthat contribute to Th17 cell differentiation are also discussed. The immunometabolic response in immune and structural cellsThe immune system needs to be poised to respond rapidly toharmful triggers and continuously adapt to diverse environ-ments and, hence, requires immediately available energy sour-ces. At the same time, the potentially damaging effects ofresulting metabolites must be avoided ( Hotamisligil, 2017b ; Wang et al., 2019 ;Buck et al., 2017 ). Hence, cells rely on a bal- ance between catabolism and anabolism, which are dependent on various metabolic substrates, such as glucose, fatty acids, andamino acids ( Wang et al., 2019 ). These substrates are involved in at least six major metabolic pathways: glycolysis, tricarboxylicacid (TCA) cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid oxida-tion (FAO), fatty acid synthesis (FAS), and amino acid metabo-lism ( Fig. 2 A ;O'Neill et al., 2016 ). Although diverse in terms of intracellular metabolites that are generated, these pathways are interconnected and coregulated. For example, the FAS pathway, required for cellular proliferation, requires the availability ofintermediate metabolites generated during glycolysis and theTCA cycle ( Fig. 2 A ;O'Neill et al., 2016 ). Proinflammatory stimuli are usually mitogenic, activating anabolic pathways (e.g., gly-colysis and FAS) that lead to proliferation and differentiation(Wang et al., 2019 ). Alternatively, anti-inflammatory signals drive catabolic pathways (e.g., FAO) and promote cellular qui- escence ( Wang et al., 2019 ). The fast-paced literature on immunometabolism in the past few years has revealed requirements for specific metabolicevents in all immune cells: macrophages ( O'Neill and Pearce, 2016 ;Covarrubias et al., 2015 ;Russell et al., 2019 ), neutrophils (Injarabian et al., 2019 ), dendritic cells ( O'Neill and Pearce, 2016 ; Pearce and Everts, 2015 ), natural killer cells ( O'Brien and Finlay, 2019 ), and T cells ( Pearce et al., 2013 ;Bantug et al., 2018 ;Man and Kallies, 2015 ). The status of cellular metabolism governs the types of cytokines produced by immune cells and, consequently,the ensuing immune response. This concept was illustrated in macrophages, where M1 cells are highly glycolytic, whereas M2 macrophages rely largely on oxidative phosphorylation ( O'Neill and Pearce, 2016 ;Russell et al., 2019 ;Vats et al., 2006 ). A recent study showed that subsets of -T cells differ in their metabolic signatures and are influenced by the obesity status of the host(Lopes et al., 2021 ). Hence, metabolic requirements critically dictate cell fate and function. With regard to the IL-17 pathway, immunometabolism has been most extensively studied in Th17 cells. However, non- hematopoietic cells, the main targets of IL-17 signaling, are lesswell defined in terms of immunometabolic events ( Monin and Gaffen, 2018 ;McGeachy et al., 2019 ). The sensitivity of IL-17 target cells is thought to be mainly due to restricted expressionof the essential IL-17RC subunit. With the exception ofin vitro Th17 cells ( Chong et al., 2020 ), IL-17RC is generally expressed at low or undetectable levels in he- matopoietic cells ( Kuestner et al., 2007 ;Ishigame et al., 2009 ). IL-17 -responsive cells reside in h ighly diverse tissues and organs, and hence, it is not surprising that each cell type hasdistinct metabolism and nutrient usage. Recently, advances insingle-cell transcriptomic technologies have uncovered theheterogeneity of mesenchymal and epithelial cells, even withinsingle tissues ( Koliaraki et al., 2020 ;Krausgruber et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the consequence of global single-gene deletion models in mice may often not mirror what is happening at the tissue level. For example, IL-17 deficiency predisposes mice to age-associated obesity and impaired glucose tolerance but improvesglucose uptake and insulin responses of adipocytes in vitro(Z\u00b4u\u00f1iga et al., 2010 ). In addition, the actions of IL-17 are context dependent and may vary in physiological and pathological out-comes, leading to somehow contradictory IL-17 -mediated meta- bolic regulation. Several examples are provided in Table 1 .O f note, IL-17 signaling outcomes are not only influenced by the specificity of its target cells but also by concomitant signals fromother cytokines present in the same environment. IL-17 is noto-rious for its ability to mediate synergistic or cooperative signal-ing with other cytokines or inflammatory stimuli ( Li et al., 2019 ), which may constitute another compelling reason behind thepleiotropic roles of IL-17 on both local and systemic metabolism. Beyond their well-established role in providing structural support to organs, epithelial and mesenchymal cells are actively involved in immune responses, which has become increasingly Figure 1. Overview of IL-17 -mediated metabolic regulation. IL- 17-driven metabolic pathways homeo- metabolic regulation Cellular appropriate temporally and spatially regu-lated IL-17 signaling, at the risk of damage to tissues with criticalmetabolic functions. Bechara et al. Journal of Experimental Medicine 2o f1 3 IL-17 regulates cellular and tissue metabolism https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20202191appreciated ( Tuong and Clatworthy, 2020 ;Koliaraki et al., 2020 Nowarski et al., 2017 ;Malhotra et al., 2013 ). Several prominent examples support the immunomodulatory role of structuralcells ( Koliaraki et al., 2020 ): mesenchymal cells in adipose tissue promote T reg cell differentiation ( Spallanzani et al., 2019 ;Vasanthakumar et al., 2015 ;Kohlgruber et al., 2018 ), FRCs lymphoid and mal cells in the synovium (SFs) are key determinants of the in-flammatory response 2020 ). Generally, IL-17 -mediated metabolic regulation in target cells promotes proliferation (e.g., in SFs and FRCs; Kim et al., 2017;Majumder et al., 2019 ); migration (e.g., in SFs; Kim et al., 2017) as well as the expression of metabolic enzymes (e.g., Cpt1a in FRCs [ Majumder et al., 2019 ]; arginase-1 in keratinocytes [ Lou et al., 2020 ]); and inflammatory mediators, which are involved in immune regulation. Consequently, dysfunctional metabolicregulation in IL-17 target cells may contribute to IL-17 -driven diseases. Metabolic regulation in IL-17 -driven physiological responses IL-17-mediated metabolic regulation in barrier tissue IL-17 is a potent driver of barrier tissue repair ( Zhao et al., 2020a ), a metabolically demanding process ( Eming et al., 2017 ) .T h er e g e n e r a t i v er o l ef o rI L - 1 7i nt h eg u tw a si n f e r r e d from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, whosesymptoms were unexpectedly aggravated after clinical trials ofanti-IL-17A/IL-17RA biologics for Crohn 's disease ( Hueber et al., 2012 ;Targan et al., 2016 ). These observations were consistent with prior studies in mice showing that Act1, theessential IL-17R adaptor, promotes tissue repair in response to gut injury ( Qian et al., 2007 ). Consistent with this, IL-17 neu- tralization or Il17a deficiency in mice caused tran sodium sulfate -induced intestinal injury ( Ogawa et al., 2004 ;O'Connor et al., 2009 ;Lee et al., 2015 ). Similarly, IL-17 promotes wound healing in the skin, and impaired IL-17 inmurine models of skin injury resulted in delayed wound clo-sure, decreased barrier integrity, and skin microbiome dys-biosis ( MacLeod et al., 2013 ;Floudas et al., 2017 ). Collectively, in homeostasis and acute models of inflammation, IL-17 promotesskin and gut tissue repair rather than drives pathogenic in-flammation, as it does in psoriasis. IL-17 -dependent wound healing properties are explained by several mechanisms. IL-17 promotes proliferation of keratino-cytes and epithelial cells via mitogenic signals, such as the ERKpathway ( Shen et al., 2009 ;Zepp et al., 2017 ;Wu et al., 2015 peptides(e.g., -defensins, Whibley and Gaffen, 2015 ;MacLeod et al., 2013 ;Ha et al., 2014 ) and metalloreductase Steap4 ( Wu et al., 2015 ), which promote proliferation ( Lee et al., 2015 ;Whibley and Gaffen, 2015 ; MacLeod et al., 2013 ;Ha et al., 2014 ). Although the expression of genes associated with epithelial tight junction integrity was notmodified in Il17a- deficient mice, IL-17 regulates cellular locali- zation of the tight junction protein occludin proposed to underliegut epithelial barrier function ( Lee et al., 2015 ). In addition, synergistic signals mediated by other cytokines present in thelocal inflammatory milieu appear to tune IL-17 -mediated tissue repair. Specifically, IL-17 synergizes with fibroblast growth factor 2 to induce genes that repair damaged epithelium ( Song Figure 2. IBmediates IL-17 -driven metabolic and immunological responses. (A) Cellular metabolism generates energy and regulates cell function in numerous ways. Glucose metabolism creates intermediates that supply different metabolic pathways. For example, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-C oA, which feeds into the TCA cycle to generate ATP. Oxaloacetate and citrate are used for nucleotide and lipid synthesis, respectively. Fatty acids are metabol ized through -oxidation to acetyl-CoA, to (e.g., directly influence downstream pathways through distinct TRAF proteins. TRAF6 I B,N F B, C/EBPs, Together, these upregulate -dependent target genes. Additionally, IL-17 controls posttranscriptional events that increase target mRNA levels through RBPs (e.g., Act1, HuR, Arid5a, Regnase-1). (C)IL-17 promotes stromal cell survival in lymph nodes (e.g., FRCs) through cell metabolic regulation involving an I B-dependent increase in glycolysis and mitochondrial activity. Bechara et al. Journal of Experimental Medicine 3o f1 3 IL-17 regulates cellular and tissue metabolism https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20202191et al., 2015 ). In principle, IL-17 -induced repair responses could be regulated by nutrient availability. Nevertheless, our under- standing of how the different bioenergetic pathways (e.g., gly- colysis, FAO) impact IL-17 -mediated tissue repair and regeneration is still limited. Although IL-17 signaling drives cell proliferation and tissue repair, this process may lead to tumorigenesis when dysregu-lated ( Wang et al., 2014 ;Ernst and Putoczki, 2014 ;Zhang et al., 2017). Indeed, chronic inflammation is known to promote colo- rectal tumorigenesis ( Terzi \u00b4ce ta l . ). In this context, IL-17 synergizes with TNF- to induce an NF- B-and HIF1 - dependent glycolytic pathway that promotes the survival andproliferation of cultured human colorectal cancer cells ( Straus, 2013). IL-17 signaling in skin stem cells represents another ex- ample of the link between inflammation and tumorigenesis(Chen et al., 2019 ). In this setting, IL-17 promotes recruitment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the IL-17R complexin skin stem cells. This allows the phosphorylation of EGFR and subsequent activation of the ERK5 pathway, resulting in cell proliferation and wound-induced tumorigenesis ( Chen et al.,2019 ). between IL-17 and EGFR sig- naling in skin stem cells represents a surprisingly direct inte- gration of IL-17 and growth factor signaling in tissue repair and tumorigenesis. IL-17-mediated metabolic regulation in nonbarrier tissue It has long been noted that mice lacking IL-17R or IL-17A areoverweight, gaining fat mass with age ( Z\u00b4u\u00f1iga et al., 2010 ; Goswami et al., 2009 ;Ahmed and Gaffen, 2010 ). These ob- servations were consistent with prior studies investigating the role of IL-17 in osteoporosis, where IL-17 was shown to suppress mesenchymal differentiation of adipocytes and promote differ-entiation of osteoblasts ( Shin et al., 2009 ;Huang et al., 2009 ). These studies support a model in which lack of IL-17 establishesan environment where adipogenesis is favored.

(2019) The metabolism-modulating activities of IL-17 are context dependent and may vary on the basis of its target cells. Bechara et al. Journal of Experimental Medicine 4o f1 3 IL-17 regulates cellular and tissue metabolism https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20202191adipogenesis through the combined effects of TFs that regulate adipocyte differentiation ( Fig. 3 ). IL-17 contributes to the homeostatic regulation of glucose metabolism as well ( Z\u00b4u\u00f1iga et al., 2010 ). In vitro, IL-17 inhibited insulin-induced glucose uptake by adipocytes ( Z\u00b4u\u00f1iga et al., 2010 ). The capacity of IL-17 to regulate glucose homeostasis was further confirmed in vivo. Indeed, young IL-17 -deficient mice present with slightly increased fasting glucose levels,lower insulin levels, and improved glucose clearance upon glu-cose tolerance test ( Z\u00b4u\u00f1iga et al., 2010 ), an effect that was lost upon development of age-associated obesity ( Z\u00b4u\u00f1iga et al., 2010 ). Like IL-17, the effects of IL-6 on glucose metabolism are context dependent, leading to both positive (improved insulin sensitivity) and negative (impaired glucose tolerance) outcomes (Hotamisligil, 2017b ). In contrast to IL-17 and IL-6, the metabolic effects of TNF- are highly consistent among mouse models, where neutralization of TNF- results in increased insulin sen- sitivity (for a complete list, see https://www.metaflammation.org ; Borst et al., 2004 ;Ara\u00b4ujo et al., 2007 ;Hotamisligil, 2017b ). Adaptive thermogenesis is the process of heat production, mainly in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and recent evidence shows that IL-17 contributes to this process. Thermogenesis is mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which uncouplesmitochondrial FAO from ATP production, thereby releasing theenergy of substrate oxidation as heat ( Chouchani et al., 2019 ). In addition, BAT is richly innervated by sympathetic nerves, whichrelease norepinephrine upon external stimuli (e.g., cold), andconsequently activate lipolysis and thermogenic regulation(Chouchani et al., 2019 ). a homeostatic adipose population of IL-17 -secreting -T cells is required for the maintenance of body temperature ( Kohlgruber et al., 2018 ;Papotto and Silva-Santos, 2018 ). IL-17 and TNF- signaling in BAT trigger expression of UCP1, driving adaptive thermogenesis(Fig. 3 ). Consistent with this, IL-17 -deficient mice are suscepti- ble to hypothermia as demonstrated by decreased expression ofthermogenic genes (e.g., Ucp1) and a failure to increase energy expenditure after cold challenge ( Kohlgruber et al., 2018 ;Papotto and Silva-Santos, 2018 ). A related study found that IL-17F, rather than IL-17A, impacted thermogenesis. IL-17F was suggested topromote expression of TGF- 1 in adipocytes, which in turn supported sympathetic innervation of adipose tissue and henceactivated lipolysis and thermogenesis via norepinephrine(Ciofani, 2020 ;Hu et al., 2020 ). Accordingly, these studies point to intriguing cross talk between IL-17 and adipose tissue in ho- meostatic body temperature control ( Fig. 3 ). In addition to its role in regulating adipogenesis and energy homeostasis, IL-17 mediates metabolic-immunological coordi- nation mice, the number of IL-17-producing -T cells increase concomitantly with T reg cells in adipose tissue ( Fig. 3 ;Kohlgruber et al., 2018 ;Papotto and Silva-Santos, 2018 ). Consequently, Il17a /mice show a decrease in T reg cell numbers in fat, suggesting that IL-17 is implicated in homeostatic expansion of T reg cells ( Kohlgruber et al., 2018 ; Papotto and Silva-Santos, 2018 ). This effect is thought to be initiated by IL-17 and TNF- signaling in adipose stromal cells leading to production Kohlgruber et al., 2018 ;Papotto and Silva-Santos, 2018 ), thereby maintaining the expansion of T reg cells expressing the IL-33 receptor (ST2). Although these studiesdid not report the consequences of IL-17 -mediated T reg cell accumulation on insulin sensitivity ( Mathis, 2019 ), T reg cells are known to promote this process ( Feuerer et al., 2009 ;Kolodin et al., 2015 ). Hence, the ability of stromal adipose tissue to Figure 3. IL-17 -mediated metabolic adipose tissue. The IL-17 pathway exerts an antiadipogenic role by suppressing adipocyte differentiation through decreased expression of proadipogenic TFs. IL-17A promotes adipose cells, leading to T reg cell expansion. IL-17F is reported to trigger sympathetic innervation and norepinephrine (NE) release. Bechara et al. Journal of Experimental Medicine 5o f1 3 IL-17 regulates cellular and tissue metabolism https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20202191provide a niche that supports T reg cell differentiation reveals that mesenchymal-immune interactions are not restricted tolymphoid organs but can also happen in peripheral tissues. A key question that emerges from these explorations of IL-17 in adipose tissue is the impact on human obesity and metabolicdisorders, such as diabetes. Is there any advantage for IL-17-mediated metabolic-immune regulation in adipose tissue? One could speculate that the increase in IL-17 production ob- served in metabolic syndrome ( Ahmed and Gaffen, 2010 ; Sumarac-Dumanovic et al., 2009 ) may be viewed as an attempt from the immune system to correct the metabolic disordersassociated with the increase in fat storage and insulin re-sistance. Indeed, by inhibiting adipogenesis and promotingT reg cell expansion, IL-17 may play a beneficial role inmaintaining insulin sensitivity and limiting inflammation in adipose tissue. However, obesity-linked metabolic dis- eases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases,are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation ( Mathis and Shoelson, 2011 ;Donath and Shoelson, 2011 ). once obesity is established, the beneficial metabolic effectsof IL-17 may be offset by other detrimental mechanisms(e.g., high levels of TNF- ), shifting the balance toward in- flammation and leading to obesity-associated metabolic complications. Metabolic regulation in -driven pathological responses and cellular immunometabolism during inflammationPsoriasis is considered a metabolism-associated disease, but theimpact of metabolic changes in the main IL-17 target cells in thisdisease \u2014keratinocytes \u2014are not fully understood ( Pohla et al., 2020 ;Harden et al., 2016 ;Kamleh et al., 2015 ;Herbert et al., 2018 ;Zhang et al., 2018 ;Kang et al., 2017 ). It has been shown that arginase-1, a catalytic enzyme in the urea cycle, is upre-gulated in skin from psoriatic patients ( Bruch-Gerharz et al., 2003 ). Interestingly, IL-17 downregulates protein phosphatase 6, a regulatory signaling intermediate, resulting in increasedarginase-1 expression in psoriatic keratinocytes ( Lou et al., 2020 ; Bandyopadhyay and Larregina, 2020 ). Accumulation of arginase- 1 increases polyamine production from the urea cycle, which then binds to self-RNA -antigen complexes released by damaged keratinocytes. Consequently, these complexes seem to act asdanger signals and activate dermal dendritic cells to Therefore, arginase-1 activationmaintains a positive feedback loop that sustains inflammation inpsoriatic skin. Consistently, inhibition of arginase-1 amelioratedskin inflammation in imiquimod experimental dermatitis, a common mouse model of psoriasis ( Lou et al., 2020 ; Bandyopadhyay and Larregina, 2020 ). Another study showed that IL-17 induces cholesterol in keratinocytes,leading to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines ( Varshney ). However, in contrast to IL-17 -mediated re- programming of the urea cycle, our knowledge on how IL-17induces its target genes through regulation of cholesterol me-tabolism is quite limited. Collectively, IL-17 -mediated metabolic regulation in keratinocytes is a key component of a coordinated ensuing immune response.During rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SFs expand, become in- vasive, and promote joint inflammation, thereby destroyingcartilage and promoting development of the hyperplastic RAsynovium as a tertiary lymphoid organ ( Nygaard and Firestein, 2020 ). During this process, the metabolism of SFs is \"re- programmed \"as a consequence of Bustamante et al., 2017 ). This switch in the RA synovium is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction (Bustamante et al., 2017 ;Harty et al., 2012 ;Biniecka et al., 2016 ) and disruption of glucose metabolism ( Bustamante et al., 2018 ; de Oliveira et al., 2019 ). In SFs, IL-17 decreases expression oxidative phosphorylation component and, consequently,induces autophagy and inhibition of cell death ( Kim et al., 2017 ; Bustamante et al., 2017 ;Clarke and Simon, 2019 Thus, activated fibroblasts shift from oxidative phosphorylation to production, and therefore, inhibition of glycolysis de- creases cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ( de Oliveira et al., 2019 ;Bustamante et al., 2018 ). Moreover, IL-17 induces expression of the amino acid transporter LAT1 in SFs, re-sulting in enhanced leucine up take and potentiated cell mi- gratory capacity ( et al., 2018 Accordingly, IL-17 -activated SFs upregulate the expression of nutrient transporters to perpetuate inflammation. However, the efficacy of IL-17 blockade in treating RA was disappointingly modest ( Taams, 2020 ;Genovese et al., 2014 ;Mease et al., 2018 ;Pavelka et al., 2015 ). Although the reasons remain unclear, RA is a heter- ogenous disease, and not all patients present with high IL-17levels; thus, IL-17 blockade alone may not be sufficient todisrupt all the requisite inflammatory triggers effectively(Taams, 2020 ). Moreover, effects of IL-17 may be temporal in early versus late disease, an issue difficult to address in standard RA clinical trials ( Taams, 2020 ). FRCs are specialized cells located in the T cell areas of lym- phoid organs that produce collagen-rich reticular fibers to sup-port cell organization ( Salmi, 2020 ; and et al., 2020 ). How- ever, FRCs not only provide structural support to immune cellsbut also actively participate in determining the magnitude ofimmune responses as well as immune cell trafficking and pe- ripheral tolerance ( Jalkanen and Salmi, 2020 ;Krishnamurty and Turley, 2020 ;Koliaraki et al., 2020 ). Interestingly, recent studies demonstrated an unexpected role for IL-17 in drivingmetabolic regulation in FRCs during experimental autoimmunesettings, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis(EAE) and colitis ( Majumder et al., 2019 ). Like stromal cells in the RA synovium, IL-17 promotes proliferation and survival ofFRCs by increasing metabolic fitness. Majumder et al. (2019) showed that IL-17 drives these effects at least in part through induction of the Cpt1a gene, a rate-limiting enzyme of mito- chondrial FAO, which was driven by the I BTF (Fig. 2 C ). Consistently, FRCs fail to expand in mice lacking IL-17RA in FRCsduring EAE. Moreover, these mice show compromised B-cellactivation and autoantibody production ( Majumder et al., allows activa- tion of the adaptive immune response. In contrast to SFs where IL-17 -mediated metabolic regulation is detrimental, IL-17 -driven Bechara et al. Journal of Experimental Medicine 6o f1 3 IL-17 regulates cellular and tissue metabolism https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20202191metabolic changes in FRCs may have more broad consequences in a context-dependent manner. IL-17 and organismal immunometabolism during inflammation Autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and RA are often ac-companied by impacts on the cardiovascular system, andemerging data illustrate how far reaching these consequences can be ( Davidovici et al., 2010 ;Gisondi et al., 2018 ;Ferguson et al., 2019 ;Frosteg ard, 2005 ;Katz et al., 2019 ;Liu and Kaplan, 2018 ). However, the mechanisms underlying autoimmunity- associated cardiovascular consequences are largely unknown.Even so, recent studies provide interesting mechanistic insights.In IMQ-induced experimental psoriasis, IL-17 was found topromote collagen deposition in psoriatic lesions and distal skinregions and arteries, thereby altering lipoprotein traffic. Con- sequently, lipoproteins accumulate within the vessel wall, pro- moting atherosclerosis. IL-17 neutralization rescued lipoproteintransit, suggesting a therapeutic avenue for treating this com-plication ( Huang et al., 2019 ). These observations are consistent with other studies in mouse models of psoriasis where IL-17 waslinked to thrombosis and where IL-17 neutralization reducedskin and manifestations ( Li et al., 2018 ). Cumu- latively, these studies suggest that treating the noncardiovascular symptoms of autoimmunity may be effective in reducing cardi- ovascular comorbidity. Nevertheless, a recent case-time-controlstudy suggested of ustekinumab, whichblocks the IL-12/IL-23 p40 subunit, may trigger severe cardio-vascular events among patients at high cardiovascular risk(Poizeau et al., 2020 ). Consistently, low serum levels of IL-17 were associated with a higher risk of major cardiovascular eventsin patients with myocardial infraction ( Simon et al., and atherosclerotic lesion development(Taleb et al., 2009 ). Even so, the contexts in which IL-17 exerts proatherogenic effects versus protective signals is unclear(Liuzzo et al., 2013 ), and close monitoring may be needed when using anti -IL-17 therapy in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Different fibroblasts and mesenchymal cell types across many organs are responsible for regulating extracellular matrix(ECM) homeostasis ( Zhao et al., 2019 ;Zhao et al., 2020b ). Hence, it is not surprising that IL-17, like other cytokines (e.g., TNF- ,T G F - ), mediates fibrosis as a result of the activation, proliferation, and persistence of itstarget cells after a dysregulated healing response ( Eming et al., 2017). IL-17 is linked to collagen production in angiotensin- induced hypertension ( Wu et al., 2014 ;Madhur et al., 2010 ), bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis ( Wilson et al., 2010 ;Mi et al., 2011), and skin fibrosis ( Okamoto et al., 2012 ). Moreover, blockade of IL-17 attenuates tissue injury, inflammation, andfibrosis. However, in a model of kidney injury, IL-17 plays asurprising antifibrotic role by promoting production of brady-kinin through the kallikrein-kinin system in renal epithelialcells, resulting in production of matrix metalloproteinases that constrain fibrosis ( Ramani et al., 2018 ). Therefore, IL-17 function in tissue remodeling is influenced by the responding cell typeand the local inflammatory environment. Metabolic perturba- tion is increasingly appreciated as an underlies fibrosis, with upregulation of glycolysisfavoring ECM deposition over degradation ( Zhao et al., 2019 ; Rabinowitz and Mutlu, 2019 ;Zhao et al., 2020b ). leading tocollagen synthesis ( Zhao et al., 2020b ;Jiang et al., 2015 ). Con- siderable data show that the IL-17A - TGF- axis is important to the development of fibrosis ( Wilson et al., 2010 ;Fabre et al., 2014 ). Hence, understanding the metabolic milieu that sustains IL-17 -mediated fibrosis might offer new therapeutic avenues for treating fibrosis. Metabolic pathways as potential therapeutic targets in IL- 17-driven pathology Metabolic regulation of IL-17 signaling Cellular metabolism is not just limited to the delivery of energyand substrates for biosynthesis but can regulate downstreamsignaling by cytokines. IL-17 signaling events are initiated by themultifunctional adaptor protein Act1, which is recruited to theIL-17R after ligand engagement. Act1 in turn recruits diverseTNF receptor proteins, which initiate transcriptional and pathways ( Fig. B ; Gaffen, ;Amatya et al., 2017 ;Li et al., 2019 ;Qian et al., 2007 ). IL-17 signaling is well known to activate the classical NF-B pathway. Additional downstream IL-17 TFs include C/EBP and AP-1 components ( Shen et al., 2006 ;Ruddy et al., 2004 ;Patel et al., 2007 ;Karlsen et al., 2010 ;Slowikowski et al., 2020 ;Qian et al., 2007 ;Chang et al., 2006 ;Shen et al., 2009 ). A major transcriptional target of NF- Bi sI B(Nfkbiz ), a noncanonical member of the NF- Bf a m i l y( Karlsen et al., 2010 ;Yamazaki et al., 2005 ). IBis now recognized to be a vital mediator of many IL-17 metabolic activities ( Fig. 2 C ). As noted, IL-17 in- duction of I Bin FRCs drives expression of Cpt1a and is re- quired for elevated glucose uptake needed to support cellsurvival ( 2019 psoriasis genetically and functionally Tsoi et al., 2015 ;Johansen et al., 2015 ), and Nfkbiz/mice, similar to IL- 17-deficient mice, are resistant to pathology in IMQ dermatitis (Johansen al., 2015 ). Notably, in keratinocytes, IL-17 -mediated induction of I Band its downstream target genes is blocked by a derivative of itaconate ( Bambouskova et al., 2018 ;Bordon, 2018 ), a metabolite from the TCA cycle ( Fig. 2 A ;O'Neill and Artyomov, 2019 ). Hence, itaconate-mediated regulation of I B represents a striking example of how a standard metabolicpathway can exert immunoregulatory potential ( Bambouskova et al., 2018 ;Bordon, 2018 ). From the perspective of downstream IL-17 signaling, I Bis at a nexus of not only transcriptional events but also post-transcriptional events. It has become increasingly apparent thata major mechanism by which IL-17 mediates gene expression isthrough stabilization/destabilization of inflammatory mRNAsand control of translation ( Herjan et al., 2013 ;Amatya et al., 2018 ;Monin et al., 2017 ;Garg et al., 2015 ;Tanaka et al., 2019 ; Herjan et al., 2018 ). Strikingly, the Nfkbiz mRNA encoding I B is intrinsically Nfkbiz al. Journal of Experimental Medicine 7o f1 3 IL-17 regulates cellular and tissue metabolism https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20202191proteins (RBPs) that play opposing roles in determining mRNA longevity ( Fig. 2 B ). et al., 2015 ), A r i d 5 ab i n d st oas i m i l a rs i t ea n dp r o m o t e s Nfkbiz stability and, hence, total protein levels ( Amatya et al., 2018 ). By these means, posttranscriptional regulation pathways acti-vated cross ta lk with transcriptional sig- naling. Hence, regardless of the mechanism which IL-17 target genes are upregulated transcriptionally, RBPs canregulate their expression by con trolling the stability/trans- l a t i o no fT F ss u c ha sI B. Nevertheless, it is still not clear how IL-17 -mediated posttranscriptional events are inte- grated with its broader generate metabolic re-sponses or, conversely, how metabolic intermediates influenceRBP function. Metabolic regulation of Th17 cells Cellular metabolism may affect IL-17 activity by acting upstreamvia Th17 cell differentiation and proliferation ( O'Neill et al., 2016 ;Shi et al., 2011 ). For instance, FAS in Th17 cells generates RORt ligands, which favor IL-17 production over IL-10, as demonstrated in in vitro T cell differentiation experiments aswell as during EAE ( Wang et al., 2015 ;Gaublomme et al., 2015 ; Davis et al., 2015 ). In addition, the balance between Th17 and T reg cells is determined by FAO. T reg cells exhibit increased FAOgene expression (e.g., Cpt1a )c o m p a r e dw i t ho t h e rTc e l l s (Michalek et al., 2011 ;Gerriets et al., 2015 ). Numerous studies demonstrated that the glycolytic pathway affects Th17 cell dif-ferentiation ( Shi et al., 2011 ;Woodman, 2011 ;Revu et al., 2018 ; DiToro et al., 2020 ). Specifically, under Th17 cell -polarizing conditions, mammalian target of rapamycin upregulates HIF1 , which is not observed cells. HIF1 promotes in- creased IL-17 production, whereas de-ficiency in HIF1 diverts cells toward a T reg cell profile ( Shi et al., 2011 ;Woodman, 2011 ). Moreover, Th17 cell differentiation is maintained by the conversion of glutamate-derived-ketoglutarate ( Fig. 2 A ) into 2-hydroxyglutarate, promoting and silencing ( Xu et al., 2017 ;Pearce and Pearce, 2018 ). Thus, metabolism dictates T cell fate via epige- netic regulation. Cumulatively, modulation of glycolytic path- way, lipid metabolism, or glutamate-dependent metabolicpathway could affect Th17 cell differentiation, possibly offeringtherapeutic avenues to treat certain autoimmune conditions.Therefore, it may be useful to consider the effects of metabolicalterations on both Th17 cells and IL-17 signaling targets when de-signing therapeutic strategies. I ndeed, small molecules, such as di- methylfumarate, used to treat psoriasis and multiple sclerosis, downregulate aerobic glycolysis in Th17 cells ( Kornberg et al., 2018 , Angiari and O ' Neill, 2018 )a sw e l la sd a m p e nI L - 1 7 -induced I B expression in keratinocytes ( Ohgakiuchi et al., 2020 ). As we learn more about the implication of cellular metabolic processes in in-flammation, novel therapeutic opp ortunities are likely to be revealed for the treatment of IL-17 -related immune disorders. Conclusion and perspectives This review highlights a facet of IL-17 function that has been underappreciated until quite recently. IL-17 is best known as acritical host-defensive cytokine against extracellular fungal and bacterial species in conjunction with its widely accepted pro-inflammatory role. However, IL-17 is not simply a proin-flammatory cytokine, and the above-described studies pointed toan emerging role of IL-17 signaling in metabolism at the cellular,tissue, and organismal level. In addition, cellular metabolism caninfluence IL-17 signal transducti o n .D u r i n gi n f l a m m a t i o n ,af e e d - forward loop appears to be set in motion wherein effector mole- cules released from IL-17 target cell s modulate systemic metabolism, in turn regulating the metabolism and function of IL-17 target cells. Metabolism is integrated into the protective and pathogenic aspects of IL-17 responses ( Fig. 1 ), and it is likely that some transcriptional regulators (e.g., I B) that are central to IL-17 signaling activities also control specific metabolic programs thatsupport this cytokine 's functions. In addition, cellular metabo- lism may impact gene expression through epigenetic mod- Gaucher, 2019 ;Lio and Huang, 2020 ). Hence, a future challenge will be to define the relationships between IL-17 -mediated metabolic regulation and epigenetics or chromatin remodeling. Such epi-genetic changes may in turn be the basis of chronic, sustainedtranscriptional responses that are seen in autoimmune settings, which thereby modulate the activity of IL-17 and related proinflammatory cytokine programs.
