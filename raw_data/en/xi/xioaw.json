Specifically, individual drug manufacturers would have reduced accasg to th~ non- ~esearch and development Section 936 (Possession) Tax Credit if, and only i!, tha manufacturer incre&ses prices beyond the general inflation rate. The drug manufacturing indu1~ry receives approximately $2 billion in Section 936 tax credits each year. Under the proposal, revenue saved would be funnalQd into a new prescription drug trust fWld to finance Medicare Qutpatient prescription drug demonstration projects and to reduce the deficit. of the tax code, Section 1 establis as a formula that provides 4 strong tax incentive for drug manufacturers to keep prica increases at or below the ganaral inflation rate. 'rhe fo.r:::mula fir8t compares the drug manufacturer's section 936 tax credit to the amount of wages it paid in Puerto Rico. !f the manufacturer's section 936 tax credit excaeds the ~gs paid in Puerto Rico, the axceaa will be subject to a reduction of 20 percent of the 936 tax credit for each e cent o\u00b7nt its ri es orease over aneral tion r I- ~he reduction foz::mula will a applied on a \u00b7 drug y drug basis and be waighted according to the percent of aales that each drug accounts for the manufacturer's total drug sales \u00b7 , If the manufacturer's section 936 t4x cre<ii t doas not excaad wages paid \u00b7 , the reduction formula does not apply.

The Commission would be responsible for analyzing trands n national and international prescription drug prices and making recommendations on providing or improving coverage, reimbursement, ~nd financing for prescription drugs undEtr federal haalth care proqrams, such as Medicaid and Medicare. In addition, it would monitor the use and effect~~anas of the va.r~ous financial incentives given to the drug industry, including the revised Section 936 tax credit. Finaly, the Co:mmiesion would be charged with studying the feasibility of establishing a pharmaceutical products price review board in the United Statae.

( 11189,1) This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 23 of 104TO: FROM: SUBJECT: SENATOR DOLE SHEILA BURKE March 6, 1992 REMARKS TO PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURER'S ASSOCIATION You are scheduled to talk to the PMA Executive Board on Saturday morning. The stated purpose of their meeting is to discuss their communication strategy. There is no doubt that their press hasn't been all that great of late. They are anxious to have you talk with them candidly about what they should do to improve their image. They are expecting you to talk about 10 - 15 minutes and then answer a question or two. Issues Clearly, the issue of greatest concern is the proposal to link their Section 936 benefits to their price increases. In summary, the proposal provides that we compare the amount of the drug manufacturer's section 936 tax credit to the amount of the wages it pays in Puerto Rico. If their credit exceeds the amount they pay on wages, the excess is subject to a reduction of 20 percent of their 936 credit for each percentage point its drug prices increase over the general inflation rate. In effect, it links its 936 benefits to drug price increases. The bill currently has 10 cosponsors only one of whom is a Republican (Cohen). There is no companion bill in the House and no one seems as consumed with this issue as Pryor. I think its fair to say that Senator Pryor has been quite aggressive in his opposition to the industry and has tried on numerous occasions to put price controls into place. To date he has been unsuccessful although he was able to orchestrate the 1990 enactment of the current Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under which the drug companies must offer (or rebate) to Medicaid the lowest price (deepest discount) offered to any purchaser except, under limited circumstances, the Veterans Administration. The rumored reaction to date of the companies was to do away with most of their discounts which has become a huge problem for HMO's and community clinics. The criticism of the American drug industry is almost entirely linked to their prices and there is little or no complaint about quality or quantity. In fact, as I mentioned to you, they are viewed very positively re: their international This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 24 of 1042 competitiveness. The drug companies will, of course, argue that their prices reflect their investment in R&D, which is critical to their survival --but the public is weary of price increases that routinely outstrip price increases in the economy as a whole. For example, Medicaid paid 21.7 percent more for outpatient drugs in 1991 than they did in 1990. I think most people would agree that Senator Pryor has gone too far --but there aren't many who are anxious to defend the industry. Regarding the possible outcome of a conference with the House --Congressman Stark dislikes both Section 936 and the pharmaceutical industry and will likely support Senator Pryor. On the other hand, Congressman Charlie Rangel will likely strongly oppose because of his support of Puerto Rico. I have attached to this memo some recent stories about the industry, a list of attendees, a summary of the Pryor bill and some brief talking points. In addition to the drug specific points I drafted, I would imagine some brief comments on the upcoming tax fight would be welcome. They are obviously in support of R&D tax credits, lower capital gains rates and the investment tax allowance.

Heuer recommends Glaxo, Merck, Pfizer and Syntex because of promising new products. As the government and managed health care providers ;:y to stem drug costs, drug companies are responding with their own cost-cutting efforts. Merck, for instance, thinks it can offset price concessions given to large health care o'rganizations by reducing the size of its sales force. The Food & Drug Administration is leaning toward speeding up its approval process. A change here would substantially reduce the 10 to 12 years and more than $230 million in research and development costs typically necessary to get a new drug from the laboratory to the market. Diversity and synergy ANYWAY you look at it, Abbott Laboratories stacks up well against the com- petition. North Chicago- based Abbott spends just 21% of its estimated $7 bil- lion 1991 sales on selling, general and administration costs. Competitor John- son & Johnson spends nearly twice that amount. Cowen & Co.'s analyst Daniel Lemaitre esti- mates Abbott's pretax mar- 22%-about Bard and Becton Dickinson. What's Abbott's se- cret? Diversity, for one thing. Abbott has a big or leading market share in in- fant formula, in-vitro .di- agnostics, So when it comes to marketing and distribut- ing, Abbott is able to realize enormous efficiencies. For example, a few yearsagoAbbott's$1.5 bil- lion (1990 revenues) di- agnostics division came out with TestPack, an easy- to-use testing product that allows doctors to test for Forbes January 6, 1992 strep throat and pregnancy right in their offices. The problem was that the diagnostics sales force, which called on hospitals and clinical laboratories, didn't have the manpow- er to call on individual doc- tors. The solution? Have the drug sales force sell the new kits. Abbott is now the world market leader in the $1 billion doctors' of- fice diagnostics market, supplying physicians with test kits. It is also a world leader in the $10 billion diagnos- tics market, which in- cludes the $4 billion immu- nology diagnostics mar- ket for screening diseases such as hepatitis, AIDS and cancer. Abbott continues to invest strongly in its grow- ing pharmaceutical and diagnostics divisions. Ulti- mately, this should offset declining margins for the infant formula division, which is under pricing pres- sure from the govern- ment and competitors. As with all drug com- panies, research at Abbott is a big-ticket item. Last year alone, Abbott spent an estimated $770 million on research. Such expendi- tures grew at a compound rate of 19% for the last five Advances in laparoscopy-in which doctors make small incisions and use miniature instruments and cameras to do gall bladder surgery, hernia surgery and sometimes even appendectomies, hysterectomies and other operations- were the big news in 1991. By 1995 laparoscopy should be a $2 billion market, figures Cowen & Co.'s Daniel Lemaitre. U.S. Surgical leads this field, and Tohnson & Johnson is getting started in it. It's hard to find much in the way of earnings in the biotechnology stocks . One exception is Amgen, which wasn't profitable when it went public in 1983. But worldwide sales of its Epogen red blood cell stimulator are expected ro exceed S800 million in 1991. Of that, Amgen will get $400 million, plus royalties. In the first ten months of 1991, investors in search of the next Amgen poured Abbott 's chairman, Duane Burnham Balancing growth with investing. -years, exceeding the com- pound growth rate for sales over the same period. That kind of investing has cut into Abbott's earn- ings-per-share growth: While profits grew at a record 20% rate in 1988, they will probably in- crease only 15% a year for the next several years. But Chief Execu rive Duane Burnham, 49, sees nothing wrong v.rith that kind of progress.

The remaining $250 million was combined with a new $500 million shelf registration, filed in 1990, to form a medium term note (MTN) program for the issuance of up to $750 million of unsecured debt securities and warrants to purchase debt securities. During 1990, $200 million of MTN's were issued. At the end of 1989, $187 million of commercial paper and $347 million of debt due in 1990 were classified as long-term debt based on the Company's ability and intent to refinance such debt. The $347 million of debt consisted of $250 million 8 7/8% Notes and the two Australian (A] dollar Notes due in 1990. Loans and notes payable at the end of 1990 are composed of U.S. commercial paper borrowings of $347 million, $100 million of medium term notes and $429 million of local borrowings principally by international subsidiaries, of which $121 million represents the current portion of long-term debt.

NOTE-5: CSTOKJ Note 5 -Common Shares On March 9, 1990, the Company approved a two-for-one stock split. Shareholders of record at the close of business May 1, 1990, were issued an additional share of the Company's common stock on May 31, 1990, for each share owned on the record date. Authorized common shares were increased from 600,000,000 to 1,200,000,000 effective with the stock split. All share and per share data in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the stock split. rn 1988, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of Common Share Purchase Rights, whereby each common share outstanding has one non-voting Common Share Purchase Right. The Rights, which are exercisable only under certain conditions, entitle the holder to purchase common shares at prices specified in the Rights Agreement. The Rights were not exercisable at December 31, 1990.

A Scottish psychia- trist has charged Upjohn of Kalamazoo, Mich., with falsifying scientific evidence regarding the safety of the sleeping pill Halcion (annual worldwide sales: $240 million). The accusation has prompted a federal investigation. Dow Corning Wright of Arlington, Tenn., stands ac- 42 Business cused of failing to report that its silicone- gel breast implants were associated with severe side effects-including the devel- opment of autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. That prod- uct and similar implants made by other manufacturers have been placed in I mil- lion to 2 million American women.

'I !ML FEBRUARY 10. l'J<J2 The charges of fraud have struck an in- dustry already reeling from allegations of deception, greed and insufficient atten- tion to their products' safety. The Food and Drug Administration is currently in- vestigating an alleged cover-up by Hoff- mann-La Roche of the lethal effects of its liquid anesthetic Versed, whic h has been linked to 40 deaths from respiratory fail- ure.

Meanwhile, Eli Lilly is battling several lawsuits that claim, on the basis of scant ev- idence, that the antidepressant Prozac can cause extreme agitation, suicidal tenden- cies and even an impulse to murder. A critical social contract between man- ufacturers, regulators and the public seems to be unraveling. \"I just don't trust the drug companies as much as I once did,\" says New York City real estate agent Peggy Mathews. \"Halcion and silicone implants stand out like beacons, putting us all on the alert.\" She has reason to worry, says Dr. Sidney Wolfe, a consumer activist who heads Public Citizen's Health Research Group. \"The heart of the problem is the dangerous amount of control the industry has over testing. Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands injured be::cause data have been falsified.\" Is Wolfe just crying wolf? Or has a pervasive corrup- tion-which the FDA seems pow \u00b7erless to stop-spread throughout the pharmaceuti- cal and medical-device indus- tries? Upjohn and Dow Cor- ning strenuously deny any wrongdoing.They point out, rightly, that only a small pro- portion of consumers report problems with their products, and that it is naive to expect perfection in so large and complex a business. In the U.S. alone, there are 3,000 types of drugs on the market and more than 1.5 billion pre- STATlJS scriptions written every year. A small number of incidents with a handful of drugs is hard- ly an indictment of the entire system. In addition, say some drug- industry experts, the system has a built-in incentive for companies to be honest about their products' quality. \"The nega- tive fallout of dangerous drugs is much worse in many cases than not getting the drug approved to begin with,\" says Dr. Kenneth Kaitin, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Drug Develop- ment at Tufts University. \"If a drug has to be pulled from the market, it's very bad for public relations, financially and in every possible way. It just doesn 't make sense that they would intentionally conceal real problems. \" That kind of thinking had been the ba- sis for a relationship of trust between the medical-products industry and the FDA. Historically, the agency has counted on the pharmaceutical firms, when they apply for approval of a new drug or device, to carry out the necessary testing themselves and to do it honestly. Though agency panels scru- tinize the results of industry research, they rarely demand the raw data, relying in- stead on the analyses and conclusions drawn by the company. The FDA simply does not have the personnel or the budget to do all the research itself-nor would it be practical for it to do so. \"That road leads to madness,\" says Dr. Jere Goyan, dean of the school of pharmacy at the University of California, San Francisco, and former head of the FDA. The FDA is designed to act as a brake, not a developer. But relying on drug marketers to ana- lyze research data has serious drawbacks. Raw data are often ambiguous; the medi- cine vial can be half empty or half full.

Still, the system mostly seems to work. Last year the government carried out 203 random inspections of clinical investiga- tors and discovered just eight studies that were significantly flawed. (Offending re- searchers can be permanently barred from submitting any drug tests to the FDA.) The low rate of skulduggery has remained con- stant since 1962, which helps explain why there has historically been a \"gentlemanly working relationship between the FDA and industry.\" ' says Dr. Norman Anderson, a TIME .FEBRUARY I0, 1992 profe ssor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who has served on nu- merous science advisory panels for the FDA. The silicone breast-implant scandal may, however, change that relationship. Anderson's own trust in the system was shattered on Dec. 12, when he sat down and read scores of Dow Corning docu- ments, including 17 internal memos dating as far back as the mid-1970s, about sili- cone-gel breast implants. The information surfaced during a liability suit in Michigan. When he finished, Anderson wrote and hand-delivered both the documents and an urgent letter to the FDA demanding that all such implants be promptly removed from the marketplace. \"This appeal is not The drug remains on the market in both stronger and weaker. concentrations.

TIME Grap/\\ic by Slt\" Hart made lightly,\" Anderson wrote. He noted that Dow Corning officials had assured an FDA review panel, of which Anderson was a member, that the company had disclosed all relevant information on implants. \"I am now in possession of unprotected court documents which indicate this was not true.\" Anderson's conclusion: the memos leave \"little doubt of[Dow Corning's] mis- representation of the facts.\" The resulting furor rattled the FDA like no scandal since the thalidomide scare of the early 1960s. Following Anderson's ap- peal, the agency declared a moratorium on all silicone-gel implants, pending further review. \"It's the ultimate case as to why you need a strong agency,\" says FDA Com- missioner David Kessler. Now, says Kessler, \"the honor system is out the win- dow.\" He promises that companies will be subject to intensive audits in which investi- 43 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 35 of 104.;.-. \\, gators will scrutinize how data are ana- lyzed and presented by the manufacturers. Says he: \"People have to know that we have the will and resolve to deal with those who have crossed the line.\" Brave words from a bureaucrat with limited power. Although the FDA is en- trusted with guaranteeing the safety of all medical drugs and devices in the U.S., it is poorly armed for the job. For example, un- like almost every other federal agency, the FDA lacks the legal clout to subpoena a company's internal records if a problem is suspected. Congress woke up to the problem last fall, at Kessler's prodding, and introduced a bill that would have enabled the agency to seize corporate documents. The threat of a presidential veto halted the measure, though the new revelations about Halcion and breast im- plants seem likely to revive the initiative. Business pression sometimes assoc iated with regu- lar use of a popular category of heart drugs called beta blockers. The syndrome went undetected in clinical trials. Currently the FDA relies on spontane- ous reporting of postmarketing problems by physicians who prescribe the drugs or manufacturers who may receive complaints from doctors. It is a seriously flawed system, says Joe Graedon, author of several consumer-oriented books about prescription drugs. First, says Graedon, if a patient has a problem-say an upset oversight. Those that stand accused are also conducting somewhat belated coun- teroffensives to limit the legal damage and repair their frayed reputations. Dow Cor- ning, which has been widely criticized for reacting insensitively to the implant deba- cle, announced that it has retained former Attorney General Griffin Bell to lead an independent investigation into its devel- opment and marketing of implants. The company has also agreed to make public 90 additional documents and to ensure that it provides accurate information to the thousands of women calling the company for advice. The drugs scandals of the '90s are prompting other calls for heightened regulation. One proposal, currently making its way through Congress, would give the FDA commission- er emergency powers to pull any drug from the market. At present, about all he can do is jawbone a recalcitrant company into withdrawing a dangerous product. \"It's easier for the Consumer Products Upjohn is meanwhile reassuring physicians that reported problems with Halcion occur only at high doses and if the drug is taken for long periods of time. At the FDA's request, Upjohn revised the drug's pack- age insert to warn pa- tients not to extend its use beyond 10 days with- out consulting their phy- sician. Last week the firm filed a libel suit against its Scottish accuser, Dr. Ian Oswald, and the British Broadcasting Corpora- tion for televising allega- ,:~:-:s of fraud. Upjohn is also actively appealing the British Department of Health's decision last fall to ban Halcion. \"The honor system is out the window ... We have the will and resolve to deal with those who have crossed the line\u00b7\" The negative publici- ty has affected the whole industry, prompting sev- eral companies to curry favor with the public. Last month Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it will donate 17 different bra>1ds of blood pressure- and cholester- ol-lowering drugs for use by patients whose doctors will certify that they have no insurance or other means of paying. In addition, Bristol Myers, Syntex and Merck have announced that they will provide 12.5% price rebates on drugs dispensed in federally financed public health programs for the poor .

Even so, the measure is strenuously . opposed by both the Pharmaceutical Man- ufacturers Association and the White House, which sees it as burdensome regu- lation. Would-be reformers are also pushing the FDA to adopt a more strenuous review of drugs after they have been approved for marketing. Such postapproval monitoring is already being tried in Canada, Britain and Sweden, where officials can tap into data from a national health-care svstem. The reasoning behind the push i; quite straightforward. Clinical trials typically in- clude a few thousand people and can therefore pick up only the most obvious and prevalent side effects. Once a drug en- ters the market, hundreds of thousands or even millions of people start using it, often for sustained periods of time-when more subtle or long-term risks may come to light. Such was the case with \"beta-blocker blues,\" a syndrome of fatigue and mild de- 44 -FDA CHIEF KESSLER stomach or itching skin-he or she may not make the connection to a drug or med- ical device. Second, even if the patient does make the link, the doctor may dismiss it. Third , a physician simply may not take the time to report a suspicious problem to the FDA or drug manufacturer. \"It means extra time, extra paperwork, and there is always the fear of litigation. \" Graedon be- lieves the FDA should contract with large medical groups-major HMOs, for in- stance-to keep data bases on adverse reactions . The Bush Administration might even be persuaded to go along with this extra regulatory step. For several years now, it has been pressuring the FDA to stream- line its approval process . Agency offi- cials have been reluctant, and the recent scandals have proved them right. But streamlining approval may make more sense if postapprova l surveillance is beefed up.

Ex- perts caution, however, that hastily written rules, even if they are produced with the best of intentions, can backfire. The Or- phan Drug Act, for instance, was passed in 1983 to encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The law provides an extra economic incentive, in the form of a seven-year monopoly, to companies that market products for maladies that afflict This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 36 of 104fewer than 200,000 people. Though it has done some good, it has also been widely blamed for the outrageous prices of certain medic ations, including aerosolized penta- midine for AIDS patients, and for allowing some companies to make a killing when an \"orphan drug \" has turned out to be useful for a common disease. Congress is working on revising the measure. Business Despite such regulatory pitfalls, the time is ripe for putting some teeth into the FDA. A profit-driven system cannot be so dependent on trust, particularly when lives hang in the balance. Doctors and their patients also bear some responsibil- ity for using drugs wisely. \"All drugs have risk,\" observes physician-activist Wolf e. \"Most of the time the benefits outwei gh the risks. But there is abysmal ignorance on the part of the public about side ef- fects.\" In a culture that has long been ad- dicted to the quick fix, a healthy respect for the power of the pill-negative as well as positive-may prove to be the best medicine of all. -Reported by Mary Cronin and Andrew Purvis /New York and Dick Thompson/Washington Special Report: Drug Safety Lawyers to the Rescue plains Frank Woodside, a doctor and at- torney for Dow Corning Wright, \"don't always have qualifications, and prey upon the sympathy of the jurors.\" Legal action helps keep drug companies honest, but it's a crazy way to regulate an industry Last fall, for instance, despite ambigu- ous evidence, a jury ordered Merrell Dow to pay a Texas couple $33.8 million; they claimed the antinausea drug Bendectin had maimed their child in the womb. And patients around the country are lining up to sue Eli Lilly, alleging that the anti- depressant Prozac induces violent thoughts-despite FDA findings to the contrary. In some cases, companies decide to settle out of court rather than take their chances with juries. Upjohn, for example, paid an undisclosed sum to a woman who claimed the drug Halcion had driven her to commit murder. Most doctors believe the allegation is absurd. By MICHAEL D. LEMONICK T he news about the dangers of silicone implants may have struck terror into the hearts of thousands of women, but for many trial lawyers it represents a bonanza. More than 1,000 implant-related lawsuits have already been filed by women who claim they were disfigured or debilitated by the devices. And the reve- lation that manufacturers may have knowingly buried facts about the dangers is causing the numbers to sky- rocket. Some attorneys have even set up toll-free num- bers to handle-and encour- age-the surge.

But today, Congress is trying to cure the ills of the industry that reaped the profits. BY JULIE KOSTERLITZ S even years after it passed landmark consumer legislation to help get low-cost generic versions of pre- scription drugs on the market, Congress is trying to clean up a scandal involvmg tfie mdustry that rea ed the pr s an t e e era o 1cials charge with regulatm~ 1t. I wo key ouse Members recently agreed on legislation that would impose toue:h \u00b7 eneric dru com a- mes that run afoul o ru A mm1s ration FDA). \"The whole I ea of 1s 1 1s to restore public confidence in the generic drug industry and FDA's handling of that industry, \" said Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommit- \u00b7 tee on Health and the Environment and an author of the 1984 law. Following the enactment of the Patent Term Restoration and Drug Price Com- petit ion Act, lower-cost copies of brand- name prescription drugs flooded into the marketpl ace, as the bill's authors intend- ed. Exact figures are hard to come by, but experts estimate that buyers have been saving hundreds of millions of dollars a year ever since-even though they believe that the full potential for generic drug sales is yet to be realized. The 1984 statute opened up lucrative financial opportunities for generic drug manufacturers. Some , in their scramble to cash in quickly, defrauded the system set up to make sure generic drugs deliv- ered what they promised: safe and effec- tive medication with properties equiva- lent to those of their brand-name competitors. Regulators at the FDA were bribed, firms cheated on tests of their products and false information was sub- mitted to the agency . In the past two years , five FDA offi- cials, nine generic industry executives, an industry consultant and four generic drug companies have been convicted of or have pleaded guilty to charges related to the scandal. While those found culpable thus far represent a tiny fraction of the industry , federal investigators say there 's more to come . The scandal caught many people off guard. Consumer advocates both inside and outside of Congress had viewed the generic drug companies as partners in a battle against the large pharmaceutical houses, whose brand-name products had monopolized the market. \"It's one of the great disappointments, because I had hoped the generic industry would turn into something clean and decent and would offer honest and honorable com- petition to the rest of the pharmaceutical industry, \" said Michigan Democrat John D. Dingell, who is chairman of the House . Energy and Commerce Committee and its investigative subcommittee that helped unearth the pattern of misdeeds. \"It turned out I was prodigiously in error.\" Dingell estimates that 33-50 per cent of the companies that make up the generic industry either have been convicted or are under investigation. At a 1990 hear- ing, he labeled the generic drug industry \"the most pervasively corrupt this sub- committe e has ever uncovered. \" Many observers-including FDA high- er-ups-were also shocked at the revela- tions of the corruption of regulators at an agency that has long prided itself on its sense of mission in protecting the public health. Some critics, including Dingell, contend that the budget cuts and deregu- latory agenda of the Reagan Administra- tion contributed to lax management by the FDA. But there were signs of potential trou- ble in the generic industry and at the FDA well before Congress passed the 1984 law, and even before the Reagan Administration took office. Some prob- lems were apparently unknown to con- sumer advocates in Congress and else- where; others may have been overlooked by these advocates in their zeal to help get generic drugs out to consumers. The government's failure to heed the warning signs and keep a tight rein on the expanding branch of the drug industry has set back the consumer movement's objectives. More than 130 generic drugs have been challenged by the FDA, rough- ly half of which have already been pulled from the marketplace. Hundreds more NATIONAL JOURNAL 5/25/91 1229 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 38 of 104/ / GENERIC DRUG INDUSTRY CHAMPION'S MUTED VOICE At a time when Congress is consid- ering legislation that would help decide the future of generic drugs, the leading spokesman for the industry in past Washington battles has lowered his public profile. Capitol Hill sources say the clout of William Had- dad, the politically well-connected chairman of the Generic Pharmaceuti- cal Industry Association (GPIA), has diminished as his group's membership has dwindled and since his own name surfaced in a congressional probe of questionable industry practices. Haddad officially stepped aside as the GPIA's president and chief spokesman in 1985 but continued to be recognized as the industry's leading advocate, testifying as recently as March 1990 before the House Select Committee on Aging. During three years of investigations leading up to the introduction of pro- posals to subject generic drug manufac- turers to tough new sanctions, Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee has ques- tioned business dealings involving Had- dad. In several subcommittee hearings, Dingell aide David W. Nelson h-as probed an arrangement under which Danbury Pharmacal. of Carmel, N.Y., received 50 per cent of the profits from the sale of a generic copy of a best-sell- ing anti-hypertensive drug called Dyazide manufactured by another company, Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. A former Food and Drug Adminis- tration (FDA) official, Marvin Seife , have been withdrawn voluntarily by man- ufacturers. In a few cases, the removals have left very popular brand-name drugs without generic competitors. which typi- cally cost less than half as much. There is no evidence that generic drugs wrongfully approved by the FDA have caused any harm. But public confidence in both generics and the FDA has suf- fered a blow. And the approval of new generic drugs by the beleaguered FDA has slowed to a trickle . \"Congress sought to get generic drugs into the hands of patients at reasonable prices-fast,\" said the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in an April ruling on a suit brought by a generic drug company protesting the slowdown in approvals. 1230 NATIONAL .IOuRNAL 5/25/91 testified that Haddad, a Danbury offi- cial, repeatedly pressed him to hurry approval of the drug-an allegation Haddad denies-and that the drug was approved in an unusually short time. Bolar, the first of only two firms to get approval to make generic Dyazide, has since been found to have cheated on key tests of the drug and to have submitted fraudulent information to the FDA to gain approval of its version of Dyazide. Bolar's sales of the drug, at roughly 50 per cent of the price of the brand-name drug, totaled $14{) million before its Dyazide copy was pulled from the market in January 1990. In March, Bolar pleaded guilty to several fraud charges and was fined $10 mil- lion-a record fine for violating FDA regulations. The subcommittee has made no direct allegation of misconduct on the part of Haddad. But in a June 1990 statement, Nelson said, ''The subcom- mittee has been very, very interested in the activities of Danbury and one of its officers, William Haddad, because of inconsistencies in staff interviews and in the press statements regarding the involvement of Mr. Haddad in Bolar 's Dyazide approval , which was subse- quently withdrawn by the FDA because of fraud.\" Haddad, who is now also vice chair- man of Danbury's parent company, Schein Pharmaceutical Inc. of Port Washington, N. Y., declined an inter- '~ew, but sent a statement to National Journal , which he said was intended to \"put a stop to any potentially mischievi- ous rumormongering.\" In the state- ment, Haddad said he \"had no fore- \"The record before us reflects the defeat of those hopes .. , UNPROPPING PRICES To understand what went wrong in the generic industry, it's important to under- stand the prescription drug marketplace before 1984. Many popular prescription drugs were marketed only under the brand names of the pharmaceutical com- panies that had researched and devel- oped them-even after the patents on such drugs had expired. Generic copies could be produced and sold for a fraction of the prices charged for off-patent brand-name drugs. Despite generics\u00b7 similarity to already-approved knowledge or involvement in any plan by any generic company to falsify any submission to the FDA with regard to any drug\" and that he \"did not exert 'pressure ' on Dr. Seife to obtain the ap- proval of any drug. \" Originally developed by SmithKline Beecham, Dyazide is a top-selling drug used to treat hypertension. It earned $1 million a day for its developer while still under patent, according to testimo- ny before the subcommittee. The drug had long been eyed by generic drug manufacturers eager to produce their own equivalents of the drug after its patent expired but according to indus- try experts, the drug's imperfect formu- lation was very difficult to copy. Haddad is an unusual figure to end up in Dingell's gunsights. As the GPIA's first president in the early 1980s, he was a key figure in crafting the landmark 1984 compromise legisla- tion that helped generic drugs gain entry to the marketplace in a big way. He boasts a Jong resume in other fields, including stints as a reporter for the New York Post and The New York Her- ald Tribune, as a special assistant to for- mer Sens. Estes Kefauver , D-Tenn. , and Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., as an investigator for the New York State Assembly and as an assistant to automaker John Z. DeLorean. He has worked in political campaigns for New York Lt. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn. Over the past few years, the GPIA has experienced a decline in member- ship, partly through resignations and expulsions related to scandals within the industry. drugs, federal requirements for the ap- proval of copycat products were-with the exception of certain grandfathered older drugs-as rigorous as those for newly developed drugs. The process was so costly and time-consuming that almost no one tried to market them. In the 1970s. congressional attempts to lower the bars to generics met with no success. But in the early J 980s, the poli- tics of the issue began to change. That's when brand-name pharmaceutical manu- facturers began pressing Congress to grant their products longer patents-and thus longer protection from competi- tion-to make up for the time that they said was lost while the FDA approved their drugs. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 39 of 104 Consumer organizations and the then- tiny generic drug industry were gall'a- nized into mounting a counteroffensil'e . In the end, a compromise was brokered in Cor.gress that promised gains to both sides. The law enacted in 1984 gave the big pharmaceutical houses some added patent protection for their brand-name products and vastly simplified the FDAs approval process for generic drugs. Ge- neric drug manufacturers henceforth would have to show only that their drugs had the same active ingredients as the brand-name equivalent , could be absorbed by the body in a similar fashion and were being manufactured in an ac- ceptable manner. Almost overnight , a host of generic drugs poured into the marketplace ; in just over a year, the number of generic products nearly doubled. The more com- petitors per drug, the bigger the savings for consumers; prices of generic equiva- lents range from 67-75 per cent of brand- name prices to as low as 10 per cent. Expected savings were pegged at as much as $236 million in 1984 and are beliel'ed to have increased at least tenfold since. A pharmacy company run by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP ) reports that its roughly three million cus- tomers save approximately $100 million a year by using generic drugs. The big savings enjoyed by consumers have been matched by big profits for matl'!!'ti!l.cturers. Three years after the law passed, annual sales of generic drugs had more than tripled to S3.4 billion , and have since more than doubled again , with current annual sales estimated at S7 bil- lion-$9 billion. It was particularly lucrative to be first on the market with a generic alternative. The first copycat dru;; attracts Jots of cost-conscious buyers and often retains its market advantage even after other copies of the same drug become available because it has become a known quantity to the pharmacists who stock drugstore shelves. A first copy \"could be guaran- teed 50-60 per cent of the [generic] mar- ket share over the therapeutic life of the drug,\" said F. Nicholas Willard, director of governmental affairs for Retired Per- sons Services, the pharmacy company run by the AARP. That incentive touched off a mad scramble to be first. The law requires that the FDA approve generic drug applica- tions on a first-in, first-out basis. Several companies rushed forth with applications for drugs that they hadn \" t yet figured out how to manufacture properly. It was later revealed that some companies lied about their manufacturing practices or cheated on required laboratory tests; if they couldn't make a proper copy, some sim- ply submitted a sample of a brand-name drug for testing in place of their own product. Some generic manufacturers also found that they could increase their chances of being first on the market by bribing FDA officials. Despite the agen- cy\"s. squeaky-clean image , court cases would later show that a few FDA officials expedited some applications and slowed down others-sometimes for profit and sometimes on arbitrary whim. Charles Y. Chang, an FDA supervis ory chemist who later pleaded guilty to racke- teering charges , told a congressional Investigations from 1975-81. \"We thought. \u00b7wouldn \u00b7t it be great to find a way these guys could come out and be big competitors to the big [pharmaceutical] houses?'\" In hindsight. it can be said that a close look at the industry on the eve of the enactment of the 1984 law might have suggested trouble. ''It was true we would talk among ourselves that [some of the generic firms] 11\u00b7eren't the most ethical ,\" said Judith Brown. a drug policy analyst for the AARP from 1978-90. But she added that no one talked specifics, and Michigan Democrat John D. Dingell, head of House investigative subcommittee Generic drug industry is \"the most pervasively corrupt'' his panel has ever found. inqui ry that \"when I sought to influence the order of approvals, I would assign [applications] for the larger companies to the picky reviewers, while the smaller companies got the fast reviewers.\" Chang received more than $20,000 from generic drug companies in foreign trips, furniture and computer equipment. A LITTLE-KNOWN INDUSTRY Unsavory practices on the part of man- ufacturers caught most proponents of generic drugs off guard. \"I think a lot of people were absolutely amazed at what we found out,\" the AARP\"s Willard said. \"I was personally distraught by the reve- lations, because I ... had gone out and represented myself and my company as a total beliel'er [in generic drugs].'\" Many consumer advocates had come to view generics as partners in the quest for consumer justice. \u00b7' I don't know if we equated idealism with entrepreneurial- ism, but we knew that the big guys were taking advantage of the situation,\" said Elliot A. Segal , who was a special assis- tant on the House Energy and Com- merce Subcommittee on Oversight and the feeling was that \"the industry was changing and had changed.\" In 1984, the generic industry included both small, unsophisticated family-run companies and firms with state-of-the art plants that were attracting seasoned offi- cials from the more-established brand- name companies. Indeed, despite the fact that the brand-name pharmaceutical houses often disparaged the quality of generic drugs and the companies that made them , large drug companies some- times contracted with generic companies to make brand-name products. As Congress moved closer to passing a law, however, the business attracted a host of newcomers. \"When [investments in generic drugs) started to show up as fairly profitable. lots of new companies came in,\" said Stephen W. Schondelmey- er, director of pharmaceutical economics research at Purdue University . \"Some of those less-experienced entrepreneurs came into the market\" in the early 1980s in anticipation of the new law, he said. Inexperience and big expectations, it turned out, were a dangerous combina- tion. \"Prescription drugs are not like making candy ; \u00b7 Schondelmeyer said. \"In NATIONALJOURNALS/25/91 1231 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 40 of 104. \u00b7 . Y :/ prescription drugs, making tablets that work is [not always] easy to do .... Many found it required a sophistication of man\u00b7 ufacturing beyond just compressing tablets,\" he said. '\"So there were a num- ber of them that cut corners.\" Dingell said that \"some of these peo- ple took what were essentially garage operations to $100 million corporations in a matter of a couple years.\" He argued that \"given the expectations they had, they had enormous incentives to bribe and to engage in all manner of scanda- lous practices.\" While many of the new generic manu- facturers were unknown quantities, some of them arrived with unsavory reputa- tions. Several spin-offs of a family-run, New York City-based company, Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, are a case in point. Premo was considered a pioneer in the industry in the 1960s when it cracked into the marketing of the antibi- otic tetracycline, which previously had been controlled by a cartel. But in the 1970s. Premo marketed unapproved drugs that were seized by the FDA, and in 1981, a company official was caught selling outdated antibiotics under a competitor 's label to so-called medicaid mills in New York City, according to reports in the Long Island-based daily Newsday. The company was sold shortly there- after, but a successor company along with several others founded b,\u00b7 former Premo officials have since figured in the scandal over generic drug applications: Par Phar- maceutical Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y .. was convicted of making thousands of dollars in payoffs to F6A officials; an Indianapolis subsidiary of Par, Quad Pharmaceuticals, and its former presi- 1232 NATIONAL JOURNAL 5/25/91 dent were also convicted of payoffs: Quantum Pharmics Ltd. of Amityville, N.Y., later sold to American Home Prod- ucts, was shut down and all of its prod- ucts were recalled after FDA investiga- tions found that the firm had submitted fraudulent data to the agency. Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Queens, N.Y., which purchased Premo and hired at least one key Premo produc- tion assistant, was found to have substi- tuted brand-name products for its own in five testing instances and to have made numerous other false statements in docu- ments submitted to the FDA, according to a report by Dingell's subcommittee~ The FDA has revoked or is considering revoking approval of some 30 of the firm's products, and one of the firm's for- mer officials was indicted in April for lying to the FDA. A MISJUDGED AGENCY If there were some qualms about the generic drug industry, there apparently were none about the watchdogs at the FDA who would be expected to police it. \"I think we had a blind faith in the mrn- latory process,\"' Brown, who now se~es on a new FDA advisory committee on generic drugs, said. But the agency was given little help in preparing for the flood of generic drug applications spawned by the I 984 law. The agency was given just rwo months to try to write a host of complicated regula- tions and ready itself for the deluge. For- mer FDA commissioner Frank E. Young said he complained repeatedly about the short timetable but to no avail. By contrast. Young noted with irony. the agency was given two years to imple-ment a subsequent law allowing broader competition by generic versions of veteri\u00b7 nary drugs. Congress granted the FDA a small increase in staff to help handle generic drug applications, but agency officials say it was scarcely enough to keep pace. In November 1984-the first month new applications were allowed-the agency's work load nearly tripled. In 1985, the FDA received 1,069 applications, com- pared with 470 in 1984. In addition, large numbers of amendments and additions were routinely filed as applications wound through the process. Waxman, in a recent interview, said he doesn't recall complaints about the Jaw's implementation timetable. He said he had wanted the FDA to move quickly to get cost-saving drugs to consumers. He and Dingell conceded that the agency was probably underfinanced and ill- equipped at the time, but argued that most of the blame rests with the Reagan Administration. But the FDA's generic drug division had problems that predated the land- mark 1984 Jaw. In 1980, five division offi- cials-including Chang and the division's director, Marvin Seife-were temporarily removed from their positions for accept- ing meals or other gifts of value from generic drug companies. Over the objec- tions of several of their superiors, howev- er, the five were soon reinstated-thanks in part to support from Capitol Hill. The House subcommittee that later probed the division's misconduct stepped in in 1980 to support Seife because some of its members considered him an impor- tant advocate for generic drugs at a time when the FDA was thought to favor the position of the brand-name drug compa- nies. Moreover, Seife had been a valu- able witness at subcommittee hearings on generic drug matters. According to Segal, a subcommittee aide who worked with Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., when Gore was in the House said that at the time, there was concern that the FDA was retaliating against Seife for testimony given at hear- ings chaired by Gore. Segal said there was no direct intervention by him or by Gore on Seife's behalf, but added that his and Gore's feelings about the matter were no secret. \"My guess is that Gore made it known in public hearings,\" Segal, who now is president of Managed Care Options, a Bethesda (Md.)-based health management company, said. \"I was upset,\" Segal added. \"I thought they were just trying to go after (Seife] for blowing the whistle, telling the truth.\" But several former FDA officials, all of whom left the agency before the recent generic drug scandal, said that the notion that Seife was being punished in 1980 for ' This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 41 of 104being a whistle-blower is off the mark. They said that Gore 's position effectively pressured the agency to leave some bad apples in place. \"Because of the politics of the times, the FDA was automatically cast as the weak regulator that favored the big guys and had sold out to [the powerful brand- name pharmaceutical) industry,\" said an official who asked not to be named. \"In this instance ,\" he said, Congress's atti- tude \"served to protect weak manage- ment practices in the division. \" When Seife was later convicted of lying about lunches paid for by generic indus- try officials, government prosecutors argued that he had a long history of coz:y relations with the industry over the years and said that he \"set a moral tone in the generic drug division that resulted in cor- ruption throughout the industry.\" Gore, according to a spokesman, wasn't available for comment. Waxman, however, commented: \"I expect the FDA to watch after their employees. If you have them accepting improper gratuities from generic companies or any else, it shouldn't be permitted .\" COMING UP WITH A CURE The question of how to get the generic industry back on track-and keep it there-has been a sensitive issue on Capitol Hill. The recent scandals indicate that the FDA lacks adequate authority to punish those who violate its rules . The agency has legal authority to prevent the marketing of ineffective or unsafe drugs, but not to crack down in situations in- volving fraud or criminal activity in the the drug approval process. A behind-the-scenes debate has taken place in Congress, not over the advisabili- ty of giving the FDA more power to crack down on scofflaws, but over whether all FDA-regulated industries should be targeted and over the severity of penalties to be meted out. Dingell argues that only a crackdown on the generic industry would restore its credibility. \"To let the punishment fit the crime, that has always been my purpose, my object all sublime,\" said Dingell in a paraphrase of Gilbert and Sullivan. Last year he proposed harsh medicine, includ- ing barring drug applications for at least 18 months from any company suspected of a felony in its dealings with the FDA and requiring the FDA to suspend the marketing of all products of firms found to have engaged in a pattern of abuse or which are under federal criminal investi- gation. Waxman, backed by some consumer advocates, has argued against singling out the generic branch of the pharmaceutical industry. Many backers of this argument feel that both Dingell's investigation and his proposed solutions have been overly heavy-handed and could work against restoring confidence in generic drugs. Although sales of generic drugs appea r to have rebounded after a decline last year associated with publicity about wrongdoing by manufacturers, Purdu e's Schondelmeyer estimates that only about a third of the prescriptions that could be filled with generic drugs actually are. He attributes that largely to long-standing efforts by the brand-name producers to impugn the quality of generics and to get state laws throwing up barriers to their use. (See NJ, 7/18/8, p. 1847.) Generic drug enthusi- asts worry about congres- sional action that will play into the hands of the industry's enemies. \"My concern is that what's going on with Dingell has scared a lot of people,\" the AARP's Willard said. \"I think what happened was serious ... , [but] what the generic compa- nies manufactured and put out, from what I've seen, didn't threaten the public health.\" Dingell said he is not persuaded by arguments that there is no evidence that fraudulently approved generic drugs have harmed anyone's health. \"When you take a drug that doesn\u00b7t work, you don't nec- essarily know that the drug is not work- ing,\"' he said. \"If you die or get sick, you don\u00b7t necessarily know that it's the fault of the drug.\" Dingell and his aides say they've sin- gled out the generic drug industry be- cause the corruption there is endemic: Of the roughly 36 generic drug companies with more than one product on the mar- Waxman and his allies maintain that the number of bad apples in the generic drug industry is small. The Generic Phar- maceutical Industry Asso- ciation contends that the Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif. He backs compromise to abate generic drug firm abuses. firms that have been found guilty or have admitted to fraud account for only 5 per cent of the generic drug market. (See box, p. 1230.) Legislation initially put forward by Dingell, some argued , would have need- lessly put companies out of business , such as in cases of wrongdoing by a single employee or in which past abuses have been eliminated. That 's tougher than the punishment meted out to rogue defen se contractors, argued Richard M. Cooper , a partner with the law finn of Williams & Connolly. \"I know of no precedent in American law for this kind of provision , which as a matter of punishment destroys companies on the basis of past conduct ,'\" Cooper said in a speech to the Food and Drug Law Institute last year. Dingell has responded that his investi- gation has in part been driven by \"com- plaints from the responsible part of the industry.\" He said that \"in dollar amounts,\" fraud in the generic drug busi- ness doesn't compare to that in the defense industry, but because of its public health implications, \"it's probably more serious.\" ket. a Dingell aide said, as many as 18 are currently under criminal investigation by the Justice Department. In mid-May, Waxman and Dingell struck a compromise: Proposed new enforcement powers for the FDA would apply only to generics , but some of the penalties suggested earlier by Dingell would be less harsh . The minimum debarment period would be reduced and products wouldn't automatically be recalled following company wrongdoing. Instead , recalls would be based on evi- dence of risk to the public health. \"There was no disagreement on what we wanted to accomplish, only on the details, \" Wax- man said, explaining the agreement. Dingell and Waxman say that they don't expect major opposition to their compromise and that if it is enacted, the book will be closed on the generic drug scandal. But some observers worry that the generic industry will still have a strug- gle to live up to its original promise. \"I guess what concerns me about [the legis- lation J is this heavy suspicion that any- body who makes [a generic drug) is cor- rupt,\" Schondelmeyer said.

While the structure of the industry is being influenced hy io\\'emment regulations, spiraling R&D costs, and competiti, \u00b7e pressure from generic drugs, the industry will maintain its competiri, \u00b7e edge in foreign markets. The pharmaceutical industry (SIC 283) consists of four . primary components: medicinals and 2835) and biologicals (SIC 2836). Before reading this chapter, please see \"How to Get the Most Out of This Book\" on page I. It will clarify questions you may have con- cerning data collection procedures, forecasting methodology, sources and references, and the Standard Industrial Classifica- tion (SIC) system. For other topics related to this chapter, see chapters 17 (Advanced Materials: Biotechnology) , 43 (Health and Medical Services), and 45 (MediLa l .rnd Den ' 1 ,- ments and Supplies). The United States continues to be the world's leader in dis- covering and developing new medicines and represents the world's largest single market for pharmaceuticals . Highly inno- vative and technologically advanced, the industry has consis- tently maintained a competitive edge in international markets and a positive balance of trade . In 1991, exports exceeded im- ports by about$ I billion. Drug industry shipments increased about 9.4 percent in 1991 to about $59 billion . In constant dollars , the increase was close to 4 percent. Fueled in part by demand for new drugs, exports, valued at almost $6 billion, rose nearly 14 percent above 1990, while imports reached almost 5 billion, up nearly 25 percent. For 1991, total employment in the industry reached 191,000, a slight increase over 1990. While the pharmaceutical market again proved to be resis- tant to economic recession in 1990-91, the structure of the in- dustry is changing in response to increasing research and development (R&D) costs, growing sales of generic drugs, and government regulations. Most recently, for example, the Omni- bus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated price rebates on pharmaceuticals reimbursed under Medicaid beginning in I 991. Pharmaceutical manufacturers must offer Medicaid its \"best price,\" with rebates ranging from a minimum of 12.5 per- cent to a maximum of25 percent. By 1993, the minimum rebate will be 15 percent, and there will be no maximum. Similarily, Food and Drug Administration regulations not only greatly affect the industry's domestic performance, but also have a direct bearing on its international competitiveness. New drug approvals are perhaps the most rigorous in the world. According to a 1990 study by the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University, it takes U.S. pharmaceutical firms an average of 12 years and $231 million to get one new medicine from the laboratory to the pharmacist's shelf. Only about one in five of the medicines that begin clinical trials make it through the approval process. In addition to the strict regula- tory environment , the industry must deal with increasing legal costs growing out of product liability and medical malpractice suits. Partly as a result of high R&D costs, mergers and acquisi- tions have increased as the major pharmaceutical firms seek to adjust to market conditions. In 1991, the industry's R&D ex- penditures increased by 13 percent to more than $9.2 billion. Drawn-out clinical trials, more complex diseases, and the grow- ing expense of high-technology equipment all add to escalating R&D costs. Pharmaceutical R&D has grown from around 12 --\u00b7..:ent of the value of industry shipments in 1980 to more than 15 percent in 1991, one of the highest proportions of any U.S. industry. Growing sales of lower-priced generic drugs also influence the way the pharmaceutical industry markets its products. Ge- neric prescription drugs now account for 30 percent of total pre- scriptions written. While the recent recession did not slow the demand for pharmaceuticals, Americans did scale back on their visits to physicians and were more cost conscious when pur- chasing pharmaceuticals. Direct-to-consumer advertising for non-branded generic drugs has increased. Likewise, the brand- name firms significantly increased their marketing efforts throughout the world in response to the competition from generics. INTER NA T/ONAL COMPETITIVENESS U.S. manufacturers account for 42 percent of the major phar- maceuticals marketed worldwide. While consistently maintain- ing a positive trade balance, the industry faces increasing international competition. To maintain competitiveness, the in- dustry must overcome such obstacles to U.S. sales overseas as price controls, illegal use of patents and copyrights, and foreign regulations on marketing and R&D. During the last 20 years, for example, price and profit controls in most Eurpean countries limited price increases for phamaceuticals to less than one-half of the rate of inflation.

With more $30 billion in domestic phar- maceutical sales, Japan also is the world's second largest drug market, exceeded only by the United States. Japan exports less than 5 percent of the drugs produced locally and has the highest per capita consumption of drug products in the world. Japanese spend 40 percent more per capita on prescriptions than Ameri- cans. Drugs make up 17 percent of health spending in Japan, compared with 7 percent in the United States. Although the United States has a pharmaceutical trade sur- plus with Japan, U.S. firms find it increasingly difficult to com- pete because of Japan's drug pricing system. The Japanese government not only reduces health insurance reimbursements for pharmaceuticals every two years, but also makes it ex- tremely difficult for the industry to raise prices to offset infla- tion. Japan is currently reviewing its mechanism for price setting and price management of pharmaceuticals, and has scheduled a full-scale price revision of its drug industry for April 1992. Outlook for 1992 The drug industry is expected to continue to grow at about 9 percent during 1992. In constant dollars, industry shipments are expected to increase about 3 percent, while product shipments will increase more than 3 percent. Employment will rise only slightly. Exports are expected to rise to nearly $6 billion, and imports are projected to increase to $5 billion. Long-Term Prospects The drug market is expected to continue to expand over the next five years, but rate of growth may be somewhat slower. During this period, $8 billion to $10 billion worth of brand- name drugs are set to come off-patent. How the generic produc- ers market these drugs and how the brand-name drugs compete will influence the growth of the industry. Cost cutting efforts by hospitals, major health-care institutions, the Federal Govern- ment, and insurance companies all will have important implica- tions for the industry.

MEDICINALS AND BOTANICALS In 1991 , shipm ents of medicinals botanicals were valued at more than $5 billion , an increase of about 7 percent in con- stant dollars. Export s increased about 11 percent to more than to $2 billion , while imports rose 24 percent to about $3 billion . Medicinal and botanical establishments are primarily en- gaged in manufa cturin g bulk organi c and chem ical~ anti l11<.!1r deriva tives a nd in processing bulk botanical drugs and herbs. As more product patents expire, the original patent holders have begun producing medicinal chemicals for- merly covered under their patent and selling the chemicals to generic producer s. This may incre ase domestic production of medicinal chemicals and reduce the level of import s under SIC 2833 in the future . These firms will continue to explore com - pounds among natural products to cure diseases and to develop new and more efficient approaches to new drug discovery. PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS Shipments of pharmaceutical preparations were valued at nearly $49 billion in 1991 , an increase of more than 3 percent in constant dollars. Exports and imports were more than $1 billion . The establishments in this indu stry are primarily engaged in manufacturing, fabricating , and processing drugs into pharma- ceutical preparations for human or veterinary use. The products of this group are usually finished in the form intended for final consumption . Prescription drug costs in the U.S. continue to remain a much smaller percentage of total health-care costs than in other indus- trialized countries. While spending on health care has been in- creasing rapidly as a percentage of the Gross National Product , spending on prescription drugs has remained substantially un- der I percent of GNP, just as it has for the past 25 years.

The U.S. phannaceutical industry continues to devote a considerable amount of its \u00b7re-sources to discovering new medicines for the cure and treatment of diseases that debilitate older Americans, such as Alzheimer's, arthritis, and osteoporosis. In the veterinary sector, new products will be sought to en-hance animal growth, to prevent bacterial contamination durin g processing of carcasses, and to reduce the amount of fat in meat while maintaining tenderness. DIAGNOSTICS SUBSTANCES In 1991, shipments of diagnostics substances were valued at more than $2 billion, an increase of I percent in constant dol-lars. Exports for 1991 were more than $1 billion, an increase of 24 percent. Imports of $280 million were negligible by com-parison. Diagnostic firms are primarily engaged in manufacturing chemical, biological, and radioactive substances that are used in diagnosing or monitoring the state of human or veterinary health. The blending of chemistry, biotechnology, and computer sci-ence is reshaping the diagnostics substances industry. Re~earc h-ers are now able to magnify genes to the point w~:~: :: .. _ -~ and copy their DNA sequences, a valuable tool in AIDS and cancer research. In 1991, the U.S. Patent Office issued patents for oral diag-nostic testing processes, including one for AIDS screening. Pat-ents also were granted for several rapid diagnostic test formats, inclu ding rapid tests on whole-blood specimens, which produce results much faster than older methods. The m2d,et r,.,r laboratory tpc\u00b7--r \"~M;~ -<i,eas es is ~trong ano promises to grow substant1ally over the next five years. More than 3,000 diseases are believed to be caused by genetic deformation, but gene sequences are known for only I 00. Once a gene sequence is known, it can open the way to new treatment methods. The world market for diagnostic test kits also is growing and estimated to reach about SI billion by 1996. BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS Shipments of biological products were valued at more than $2 billion in 1991, an increase of more than 3 percent in constant dollars. Exports in 1991 totaled $991 million, an increase of 2 percent over 1990. Imports were $314 million, an increase of 16 percent over 1990. Biologicals establishments are primarily engaged in the pro-duction of bacterial and virus vaccines, toxoids, and analogou s products (such as allergic extracts), serums, plasmas, and other blood derivatives for human or veterinary use. Vaccines con-tinue to be one of the cheapest and most effective ways to eradi-cate certain diseases. The likelihood is that over the next five years vaccines will be devel oped to modify the body's immune response to chronic disease.-William Hurt, Office of Chemi-cals and Allied Products, (202) 377-0128, August 1991.

What's tr,eubling is not that this report card is so bad-after all, it does contain two Ns and six B's. But ten years ago, computers and telecommunica- tions equipment would hav~ been arrayed, along forest prod- ucts, in the top-rated category. Cars, aero\u00b7 space, and industrial equipment would also have scored higher. Since no single mea- sure of competitiveness gives the whole picture, FOR.TUNE looked at three rypes of evidence to arrive at its ratings. We began by examining industrial prO\u00b7 ducrion by country, using data collected by the Organization for Economic Coopera- tion and Development in Paris, the defini- tive clearinghouse for such statistics. Comparing 1980 with 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, we asked what was the total value, in local currencies, of the electrical equipment or computer hardware made in the U.S., Japan, and ten European countries. We then converted that production to dollars and calculated the share of the total that each claimed. The charts that dot subsequent pages of this story reflect those shifting shares. This way of dicing the data told us plenty about the relative attractiveness of the U.S. as a place to manufacture. But it blurred the perfonnance of U.S. companies be- cause it includes the output of foreign- owned plants. For example, GM's factories in Rfisselsheim get tallied as German pro\u00b7 duction, while Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, counts as American. To focus more closely on the competi\u00b7 tiveness of America's multinational corpo\u00b7 rations, we looked to research by manage\u00b7 ment professor Lawrence Franko of the University of Massachusetts. Franko relies on another important international data- base-FORTUNE'S lists of the 500 largest U.S. and global companies. For each year from 1960 to 1990, he has tallied the com- bined annual revenues of the 12 largest companies in various industries and calcu\u00b7 lated the U.S. share of that total. When both Franko's company data and the OECD's counrry data are declining in tandem, you can be sure you've got trou- ble-right here in River City, or wherever. \u00b7conversely, when both are rising, you're in Fat City. Unfortunately, American compa- nies have increased their share of sales in only two of our 13 industry groups-food and scientific and photographic equipment .

The experts filled in what has happened to these 13 industries since 1989 and helped us assess nor just where they've been but also where they are going. The experts' observations, in rum, gave rise to a few broad themes that politicians and business leaders should heed if they hope to lift American competitiveness. First, U.S. manufacturers must somehow stop playing a perpetual game of catch-up with Japan . In the 1970s, while Americans con;:entrated on volume, the Japanese fo. cused on cost. When the U.S. turned its eyes to cost, Japan moved on to quality. ~ow that the quality revolution has taken hold here, Japan is embracing what Har- vard business school professor David Gar- vin calls ''post manufacturing.\" This involves ,;peeding product develop- ment as v.\u00b7ell as production, with the goal of halving the rime it takes to roll out a new manufactured good. Second, the U.S. has to clarify its think- ing about foreign invesnnent in American business. The fivefold growth in that invest\u00b7 ment since 1980 has given rise to enormous anxiety. But more often than not, foreign ownership of U.S factories is a boon. Consider what happened when Thomson of France bouiht GE's consumer electron- ics businesses . Marty Holleran, formerly with RCA and now head of Thomson's U.S. consumer electronics business, claims that GE \"never had the commitment\" his business !992 has spent ov~r $300 million in the past three years to upirade its U.S. manufacmr. ing facilities, which include the world's larg- est TV factory, in Bloomington, Indiana. Still, welcoming foreign investment doesn't mean the U.S. should blithely ac\u00b7 cept becoming a mere assembly site for companies that make technologically criti\u00b7 cal parts elsewhere. In 1988, the most recent year for which data are available, U.S. affili\u00b7 ates of foreign corporations imported $150 billion worth of merchandise-over a third of total U.S. imports. About 30% of those importS were auto parts, many of them high- tech. \"Where in a car is the value added?\" asks Maryann Keller, a top-rated analyst with Furman Selz, a New York investment bank. \"In the production and knowledge of its components-the suspensions, engines, electronics. The countT)' as a whole is a little richer from having thaf capability within its borders.\" That's why s~e advocates a strong domestic-content law for cars. One of the best ways to strengthen America's technological leadership is to figure out how to speed the development and dissemination of new ideas among U.S. companies-and not just high-tech ones. The rapidity with which the Japanese adapt technology to manufacturing processes is a big reason why their productiviry growth has outstripped America's by more than a third since 1979. (The other reason, ~hich reflects Japan's higher savings rate, is a fourfold edge in capital formation.) Eu- rope's productivity growth, savings, and in- vestment have also outpaced America's- and that rate should pick up as European unification advances. COMPETITION j Now, for a trench-level view of how a U.S. will fare in future battles for glc 2 market share, let's look closer at those industries, in alphabetical order . a AEROSPACE.

In the ne>..1 decade the edge will go to companies thar are good at securing new reserves. Developing nations, including Russia , will be inviting companies in to get their resources out. When pressed to name a first among equals, Picchi picks British Petro leum as a finder of oil. As for the rechnology of enhanced recovery, such American ~ompanies as Marathon and Atlantic Richfield are fim-rare when it comes to massaging oil from the rock that contains it. a PHARMACEUTICALS. For worriers about U.S. competitiveness, America's drugmak-ers deliver a natural high. In this fast-grow-ing marker , U.S. production rose 145% between 1980 and 1989 , outpacing both Europe (107%) and Japan (121 % ). Among professor Frank.o's top 12 phannaceu- tical compan- ies, Switzerland 's Ciba-Geigy heads the list. But six U.S. companies, led by Johnson & John- son and Bristol-Myers Squibb, have about 50% of the sales pot. And the U.S. remains the world center for research in the 1\\eld, spurred in pan by America's status as the only industrialized country where doctors and hospitals can charge pretty much what they like. In the 1990s the European industry will get a boost from political and economic unification. Myriad national regulations have made it hard for Old World drugmak-ers to introduce new products across the Continent. But any easing of trade barriers in Europe should aJso benefit U.S. suppli -ers, which will be facing mounting political pressure back home to help hold down health care com. Japan currently has no representatives among the top 12 phamiaceutical compa -nies. Thar may change in the 1990s; the Japanese share of new drug patents has doubled in the past 15 years, to 14%. Com-panies to watch: Takeda Chemical and Sankyo. Still, this is one industry where the U.S. lead looks unassailable . a SCIENTIFIC AND PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. U.S. companies have more 46 FORTUN [ \\!ARCH 9, 1992 than held their own in this grab bag category, which includes a few familiar names , like East- man Kodak, Xe- rox, and 3M, and a far larger list of smaller fry, such as Mlllipore of Bedford, Massa- chusetts. (Milli- pore makes in- struments and membrane filrers used for everything from testing wine to sterilizing pharmaceuticals .) Indeed, this is a rare example of an in-dustry where production in the U.S. has grown faster than in Europe and Japan, even as America's share of the largest com-panies' sales also climbed-from 78% in 1980 to 86% in 1990. There is some doubt that these welcome trends will continue, however. A recent Commerce Department study identified medical devices and sensor technology as two areas in which the U.S. edge could be dulled by growing J apa.nese and European competition . TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. This group generates mixed signals. AT&T is still the world's biggest telecom\u00b7 munications company, accounting for 13% of the global industry's R&D spend-ing. And U.S. companies still dominate the marker for installing private networks for businesses. But Alcatel of France has surpassed AT&T in worldwide sales of all telecom-munications equipment. Other European and Japanese companies are also growing faster, which partly explains the steep de-cline in America's share of total produc-tion-<lown from 48% in 1980 to 34% in 1989. The other reason: U.S. equipment makers moved operations offshore, mainly to Asia, and now impon a lot cf their com-ponents. On balance, America is now run-ning a $2 billion trade deficit in this industry. As profit margins on standard phone equipment continue to shrink, new tech-nology will separate winners from also-rans. FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes main-tains the best thing he can do to help U.S. companies compete in new technologies like high-deflnirion 1V and personal com-munication networks is to remove some of the obstacles that now keep various play-ers-local phone companies and cable TV companies , for example-off eac turf.

An unproductive war against drugs BY ALAN REYNOLDS Alan Reynolds is the director of economic research for the Hudson Institute of Indianapolis, Ind. AN OLD TRICK among congressmen seeking free advertising is to have their committee staffers issue a sensa- tionalist report bashing some industry or another. Senator David Pryor ( D-Ark.) has thus released a report on the \"unconscionable profits\" of U.S. pharmaceutical companies. The sena- tor plans to introduce legislation that would create prescription drug price \"guidelines.\" In reality these guide- lines would be price controls: Pryer's proposal would also repeal patent protection and tax credits for compa- nies that don't toe the guidelines. The report that occasioned Pryer's photo opportunity is a case study in sloppy analysis and cynical inference. One table, for example, compares a \"weighted average\" of prices of differ- ent assortments of \"branded drugs\" in several countries . The table pur- ports to show that drugs are cheaper in poor countries than in the U.S. Ergo, the U.S. drug companies must be ripping off consumers. Yet a mo- ment's reflection would have remind- ed the Senator that any such weighted average must be lower for poorer countries precisely because they are poorer: People in such countries cm-not afford to buy as many of the better (more expensive) medicines. Another table compares U.S. retail prices of a few drugs with the dis- counted wholesale prices negotiated by Canada's largest provincial drug- makers. It's an apples-and-oranges comparison, of course, but the report gamely concludes that \"Canadian consumers\" pay much less for drugs than do Americans. In fact, Canadians pay much more out of pocket than Americans. This is because Canada's nationalized \"universal\" health scheme does not generally cover pre- scription drugs, while most private U.S. plans do. Canadians thus skimp on preventative drugs, holding aver- age drug prices down but overcrowd- ing the hospitals. The fact that U.S. drug firms are profitable is largely because of cost- cutting and efficiency, not price- gouging. The June issue of the Monthly Labor Re11iew notes that \"the U.S. pharmaceutical industry has been very price competitive. From December 1985 to December 1990 export prices rose only 10.9%. Import prices, in contrast, rose 63.4%.\" Much has been made-in the Pryor report and elsewhere-about rising price indexes for drugs. But research by Zvi Griliches for the National Bu- reau of Economic Research shows that the producer price index exag- gerates actual drug prices by as much as 50%, because it fails to include increasing discounts to health main- tenance organizations and other such high-volume buyers. Remem- ber, too, that changes in any price index for drugs over long periods are meaningless, because it is impossible to account for improvements in quali- ty. A 1991 drug that saves your life may cost a bit more than the 1980 equivalent that left you dead, but that is qualitative progress that cost money to achieve; it is not inflation. The people of Puerto Rico will enjoy the section of the Pryor report that attacks the Section 936 tax credits. Drug companies and others have used this \"enterprise zone\" part of the tax code to reduce taxes and create jobs in Puerto Rico. But the Pryor report threatens to deny these tax credits at whim, to enforce arbitrary compliance with his drug price \"guidelines.\" Senator Pryor has bashed the drug companies before. Last year he actual- ly got a law passed that forces drug companies to rebate to Medicaid the difference between its drug charges and the lowest quantity discounts of- fered to the Defense Department or Veterans Administration. But Medi- caid drugs are purchased in thousands of local drugstores. Trying to force drug companies to give bulk discounts to nonbulk customers is having the predictable effect of forcing them to stop giving discounts to anyone. Private insurers, particularly HMOs, understand very well that modern drug therapies are helping to cut, not raise, the overall cost of health care. Another recent study in the Monthly Labor Re11iew observes that, \"in terms of constant dollars, expen- ditures on prescription drugs ac- counted for 3% of all health care expenses in 1989, a drop from 5% in 1979 .... Providing prescription drug benefits for preventative main - tenance, for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, can help avoid or minimize hospital costs.\" The evidence is plain that price controls boost demand, discourage supply, encourage monopolies and create shortages that result in waiting lines and yet more meddling by the politicians. No country that has imposed price controls on pharma - ceutical products, or has unreliable intellectual-property rights and tax policies, has ever enjoyed an innova- tive pharmaceutical industry. What is unconscionable is not high profit, but a demagogic political attack that aims to convert one of this country's most competitive industries into a regulat- ed utility, on a par ,vith the Postal Service. ..

FACT 3: After accounting for the inveatm~nt in research and development, the pharmaceutical industry still earns an annu~l Portune 500 industry-leading profit of 15.4 parcent. -This induatry profit average is TRIPLE that of the average Fortune 500 club member, which is 4.6 p<'lr.cant.

The legislation would undermine long-standing and highly successful U.S. policy, is unwise and discriminatory and would violate the three main tenets of U.S. tax policy --fairness, simplicity and economic growth. BBNBP'ITS OP SBCTION 936 Section 936 has offered tax incentives to U.S. companies since the late 1940s to encourage manufacturing investment and job creation in Puerto Rico. Section 936 has been a huge success in doing precisely what Congress intended it to do: o Puerto Rico's Gross National Product has soared from $3.7 billion in 1950 to more than $20 billion today. o Employment on the island has grown by more than 50 percent since 1950, from 596,000 to more than 900,000. o Section 936 corporations employ about 72 percent of all manufacturing employees in Puerto Rico, while the benefits associated with the Section account for about one-third of the total employment in the Commonwealth. o Imports and exports have topped $25 billion, more than all the other Caribbean islands combined. DISCRIMINATORY S. 2000 is discriminatory because: o It would apply only to pharmaceutical companies that use Section 936 --and not all drug companies do so. And it would 1100 Fifteenth Street , N.W Washington , D.C. 20005 (202) 835-3400 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 68 of 104-2- apply only to pharmaceutical companies and not to companies in other industries that use Section 936 and whose prices may increase at a faster rate. o It would apply to companies whose price increases exceed the rate of inflation solely because of unavoidable rising costs, including the costs of research and development and production. TOO COMPLEX S. 2000 would be extraordinarily arbitrary and complex to implement. o The legislation would establish an uncertain variable in corporate and government planning. The CPI --which has little to do with the cost of developing, manufacturing and distributing drugs --is only published following the end of a year, long after companies establish their prices for that year. Pharmaceutical companies thus would not know until well after the fact whether some or all of their 936 credit would be disallowed for any taxable year. o The calculations required by S. 2000 would impose substantial administrative and compliance costs on both Government and industry. ADVERSE ECONOMIC IMPACT S. 2000 would have a significant adverse impact on the competitiveness of one of the country's premier high-technology industries that has consistently maintained a favorable balance of trade. o Section 936 is the only tax advantage available to U.S. multinational corporations comparable to the \"tax-sparing\" agreements that many other industrialized nations have with . developing countries. These agreements enable foreign-based companies to operate with much lower costs than U.S. firms. o Cutbacks in Section 936, even if only threatened and not enacted, have in the past caused major reductions in investment in Puerto Rico, contrary to Congress' stated reason for retaining the provision in the 1986 Tax Reform Act --to foster economic development on the Island and in the other countries of the Caribbean Basin, a vital U.S. national interest.
