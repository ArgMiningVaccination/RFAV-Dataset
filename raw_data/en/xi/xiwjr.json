A cautionary Tale 5--reductase inhibitors -Finasteride Selective inhibitor of type II enzyme Decreases DHT by about 70% Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial -Dutasteride Inhibits type I and II enzymes Decreases DHT by >90% REDUCE trial (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) SELECT Trial (Vitamin E and Selenium) No protective effect 9 Gleason Grading Primary Grade Greater 50% Secondary Grade <50% but 5% 10 Staging 11 Principles Guiding Therapy of Localized Prostate Cancer Patients with a life expectancy of at least 10 are more likely to benefit Patients older than 75 years have other competing causes of mortality Eradication of the cancer is the goal of therapy Low grade/stage tumors may just require active surveillance 12 Watchful Waiting Observation with palliative treatment for symptoms No biochemical monitoring Ideal for patients with poor life expectancy who are likely to die from causes other than prostate cancer 13 Active Surveillance Periodic biochemical (PSA) monitoring Annual Biopsy may be part of active surveilance Conversion to active treatment when signs of disease progression develop 14 Who is the Ideal Candidate for Watchful Waiting/Active Surveillance? The probability of prostate cancer mortality is low with: Lower Gleason score Advanced age 15 Randomized Trial Comparing Surgery and Watchful Waiting Early stage prostate cancer (n=695) Deaths at median 8.2 years of follow -up Following prostate cancer surgery 83 died, 30 from prostate cancer Also less metastasis Caveats: More advanced clinically then current US patients Only 5% of men had screen detected PC Advantage largely in men <65 y.o. 16 Radiation Therapy -External Beam The principle is to deliver therapeutic dose of radiation to the tumor but minimize damage to adjacent structures Modalities of external beam radiotherapy 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D -CRT) Intensity Image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT) Proton -beam radiation therapy 17 Radiation Therapy - Brachytherapy Direct implantation of radiation seeds Maximizes radiotherapy to the tumor limits damage to the surrounding structures One time treatment 18 Radiation Therapy - Complications Gastrointestinal Less common with brachytherapy Genitourinary Incidence of erectile dysfunction varies widely Secondary malignancies Slight increase risk with bladder and to a lesser extent with rectal cancer 19 Primary Androgen Deprivation Therapy May be used in men who refused or are not candidates for definitive local therapy EORTC Trial 30891 randomized 985 men with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer to Immediate ADT vs. deferred ADT Overall survival HR 1.25, in favor of immediate ADT Prostate cancer -specific survival not different Time to hormone refractoriness not different 20 Management of Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Surgery with ADT Neoadjuvant or adjuvant Surgery with adjuvant RT Radiotherapy with ADT 21 Neoadjuvant ADT with Surgery 149 men with T2bNxM0 prostate cancer were randomized to RP vs. RP + 3 mths of neoadjuvant leuprolide/ flutamide Neoadjuvant ADT led 67.6% (p=0.663) Overall survival not reported 22 Adjuvant ADT with Surgery 98 men with localized node -positive prostate cancer randomized to immediate ADT or deferred ADT At 11.9 years of follow -up, immediate ADT had Better overall survival (HR 1.84, p=0.04) Prostate -specific p<0.0001) Caveat: Deferred ADT given for metastases/symptomatic recurrence, not for rising PSA 23 Adjuvant RT with Surgery SWOG study of adjuvant RT vs. observation for T3N0 or positive margin (n=425) 70 in the observation group ultimately received RT Endpoint - metastasis -free survival Median follow -up 12.7 years For metastasis -free survival RT = 14.7 whereas the observation = 12.9 years (p = 0.016) For overall survival RT = 15.2 whereas the observation = 13.3 years (p = 0.023) 24 Radiotherapy with ADT EORTC 22863 randomized 415 men with high grade locally advanced prostate cancer EBRT \u00b1 goserelin for 3 years (cyproterone for 1 mth) ADT group had better 10-yr disease free -survival (22.7 Biochemical Recurrence after Initial Prostatectomy or RT Rising PSA without local recurrence or metastasis Treatment options include watchful waiting, prostatectomy, RT, and ADT 26 ADT: Intermittent vs. Continuous for Non-Metastatic Castration Sensitive Disease 27 ADT: Intermittent vs. Continuous for Non-Metastatic Castration Sensitive Disease 28 Natural History of Prostate Cancer No patients received hormonal therapy without clinically evident metastatic disease. Median time from PSA elevation to metastatic disease was 8 years Median time to death after metastatic disease was 5 years. Prognostic factors predictive of outcome included the Gleason score in the surgical specimen, and PSA doubling time. 29 Metastatic Prostate Cancer About 4% of prostate cancer have distant metastases at diagnosis Bone metastases are most common Metastatic disease are virtually incurable The aim of therapy is to control the disease while maintaining quality of life 30 TAX327: Influence on Metastatic Site on Survival 31 ADT Bilateral orchiectomy or may produce an initial surge in testosterone (flare) before a decline in the levels Orchiectomy is preferred in patients who are unlikely to comply with medical therapy or due to cost Orchiectomy causes immediate fall in testosterone levels LHRH antagonist do not cause the \"flare\" Anti-androgen do not cause a decline in testosterone levels 33 Side Effects of ADT 34 Metastatic Castration -Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Disease state characterized by progression despite castrate levels of testosterone 35 1st Generation Limited role in treatment of non -metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (or to prevent flare with ADT) 36 Therapeutic Options in Metastatic CRPC that Improve Survival In 1960s, crude extract of the bark of the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia , was shown to have suppressive activity in preclinical tumor models. By 1971, paclitaxel was identified as the active constituent of the bark extract. Taxanes exhibit antimicrotubule and antitumor activity Emerging data suggests that taxanes inhibit AR translocation via microtubules 38 TAX327 A multicenter randomized phase II study of 3 weekly Docetaxel + Prednisone vs Weekly Docetaxel + Prednisone vs Prednisone 39 TAX327: Overall Survival 40 TAX327 -Summary Pain response was better with docetaxel containing regimens (35% and 31% vs. 22%) Quality of was with docetaxel containing regimens (22% and 23% vs. 13%) Is 2.5 month clinically significant? The control arm consisted of an active agent There was a cross -over which likley diminished the treatment effect 41 Docetaxel AEs Central nervous system: Central nervous system IMPACT: Randomized Phase 3 -T: IMPACT Overall Survival 45 Sipuleucel -T AEs chills, fatigue, fever, nausea, and headache Cerebrovascular events were reported in 3.5 percent of patients treated with sipuleucel -T patients and 2.4 percent of patients who received placebo. 46 Rationale for Abiraterone in CRPC. There is up -regulation of androgen biosynthesis enzymes in CRPC. Blocks androgen synthesis by the adrenal glands, testes and within the prostate tumor tissue 47 Abiraterone: COU -AA-301 Study Design 1195 prostate cancer patients were randomized and treated with Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg orally daily Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily n = 797 or Placebo orally daily Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily n = 398. The primary endpoint was overall survival. This study was conducted in 147 sites in 13 countries Patients were enrolled from May 2008 through July 2009 48 Abiraterone: COU -AA-301 Trial Respiratory: 53 Enzalutamide molecule antagonist Affinity 30 folds of bicalutamide Prevent nuclear translocation Prevents co -activator recruitment 54 AFFIRM: Randomized phase III Study of MDV3100 vs Placebo in mCRPC after Progression on Docetaxel 55 AFFIRM: Phase III trial with 1199 patients with mCRPC Previously treated with 13.6 mos FDA approved on 8/31/2012 56 PREVAIL: Randomized Phase III Study of Enzalutamide vs Placebo in mCRPC before chemotherapy 57 Enzalutamide AEs Cardiovascular: Peripheral 58 Cabazitaxel Novel taxane active in docetaxel resistant cell lines Less affinity for P -glycoprotein pump Methoxyl side chain instead of hydroxyl groups found in docetaxel 59 TROPIC: Randomized Phase III Study of Cabazitaxel vs Mitoxantrone in mCRPC after Progression on Docetaxel 60 TROPIC: Progression -Free Survival 61 TROPIC: Overall Survival 62 Cabazitaxel AEs Central nervous system: energy alpha -particles with short range (<100\u00b5m) hence less bone marrow toxicity 64 ALSYMPCA: Randomized Phase III study of Radium -223 vs Placebo in mCRPC with bond metastases 65 ALSYMPCA survival curve 66 Clinical States 68 Metastatic prostate cancer E3805 -CHAARTED Treatment 70 Primary endpoint: Overall survival 71 CHAARTED: Subgroup analysis 72 OS by extent of metastatic disease at the start of ADT 73 CHAARTED: Toxicity 74 Summary 75 Future Directions "}
