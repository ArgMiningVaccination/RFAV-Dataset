You can be assured - we have a commitment to excellence when it comes to the level of care we provide Chiropractic is a health care profession that focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system, and the effects of these disorders on general health. Chiropractic care is used most often to treat neuromusculoskeletal complaints, including but not limited to back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches. Doctors of Chiropractic - often referred to as chiropractors or chiropractic physicians - practice a drug-free, hands-on approach to health care that includes patient examination, diagnosis and treatment. Chiropractors have broad diagnostic skills and are also trained to recommend therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises, as well as to provide nutritional, dietary and lifestyle counseling. CHIROPRACTIC Everyone can recall some emotional event that has affected them rather positive or negative. Emotions like resentment, defensiveness, or a feeling of being paralyzed just to name a few can affect you long after the event that initiated it has transpired! Often it's challenging for our bodies to \"let go\" of these emotions and we find ourselves experiencing things like adverse reactions, destructive phobias, paranoia, and even physical signs and symptoms. This is where Neuro-Emotional Technique (N.E.T.) comes in handy as a means to identify and release \"stuck\" emotional patterns. Often in life we can be in situations that trigger similar experiences from our past and the emotional \"baggage\" that comes with it-this is demonstrating that often an event passes, however we have not yet moved on. NET can help identify the unresolved real (or imagined) event and help your body release its lingering emotional charge. If things become too personal or uncomfortable, just say the word and the session can safely end. You are always in control. NET is safe, effective and a natural way to instantly resolve long-standing health problems that have an emotional component. Naturopathic medicine is a distinct primary health care profession, emphasizing prevention, treatment, and optimalhealth through the use of therapeutic methods and substances that encourage individuals' inherent self-healing process. The practice of naturopathic medicine includes modern and traditional, scientific, and empirical methods. Naturopathic practice includes the following diagnostic and therapeutic modalities: clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing, nutritional medicine, botanical medicine, naturopathic physical medicine (including naturopathic manipulative therapy), public health measures, hygiene, counseling, homeopathy. NATUROPATHY NEURO-EMOTIONAL TECHNIQUE (NET) Simply stated, Contact Reflex Analysis or CRA is an energy connection. It is a technique that analyzes the energy that flows through every organ, gland and cell in the body. A shift in muscle response is used as an indicator of energy balance or imbalance in a particular area. Energy imbalance is the cause of disease in the body. The goal is to determine the means by which the energy is brought back into balance so healing can occur. CONTACT REFLEX ANALYSIS APPLIED KINESIOLOGY Applied Kinesiology (AK) is a system that evaluates structural, chemical and mental aspects of health using manual muscle testing combined with other standard methods of diagnosis. AK, a non-invasive system of evaluating body function that is unique in the healing arts, has become a dynamic movement in health care in its relatively short existence. The combined terms \"applied\" and \"kinesiology\" describe the basis of this system, which is the use of manual muscle testing to evaluate body function through the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system. Treatments may involve specific joint manipulation or mobilization, various myofascial therapies, cranial techniques, meridian and acupuncture skills, clinical nutrition, dietary management, counseling skills, evaluating environmental irritants and various reflex procedures. HOMEOPATHY Homeopathy is a safe, gentle, and natural system of healing that works with your body to relieve symptoms, restore itself, and improve your overall health. It is extremely safe to use, even with very small children and pets, has none of the side effects of many traditional medications, is very affordable, is made from natural substances, and is FDA regulated. It is used to treat acute illnesses, like colds, ear infections, migraines, and sore throats, as well as chronic conditions, like asthma, depression, autism, and arthritis. Homeopathic medicines - known as \"remedies\" - are made from natural sources (e.g., plants, minerals), and are environmentally friendly and cruelty free. Homeopathic remedies when used as directed, are completely safe for everyone - including pregnant and nursing women, infants, children, and adults. They are given in such small doses that they don't cause side effects. "}
