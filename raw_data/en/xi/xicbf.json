The things our doctors can find and \"tweak\" with diet and herbs to make sure our pets live a LONG and HEALTHY life really will astound you! This integrative, holistic approach really works! Routine blood work can diagnose many early disease processes, which allows early intervention and prevention. A regular physical once a year can allow for early diagnosis of dental health issues and even cancer! | | Vaccinations - Our doctors believe in the very careful and judicious use of vaccines to prevent disease. They truly love minimizing the impact of vaccines by using vaccine titers to help her only vaccinate when absolutely necessary. Their vaccine protocols are based on the work of Dr. Jean Dodds, and the Compassion Veterinary Hospital staff constantly reworks our vaccine protocols based on the most current studies available in our field of medicine. The safest, adjuvent-free vaccines, with no mercury or aluminum, are utilized in her practice. It is important to prevent disease, but it is also important above all else to do no harm. | | Pharmacy - Our in-house and online pharmacies allow us to provide you with affordable and convenient medications for your pets.
