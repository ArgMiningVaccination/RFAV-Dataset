Since 1951 the scientific diving community has endeavored to promote safe, effective diving through self -imposed diver training and education programs . Over the years, manuals for diving safety have been circulated between organizations, revised and modified for local implementation, and have resulted in an enviable safety record. This document represents the minimal safety standards for scientific diving at the present day . As diving science progresses so must this standard, and it is the responsibility of every member of the Academy to see that it always reflects state of the art, safe diving practice.

Volume 1 Sections 1.00 through 5.00 Section 1.00 GENERAL POLICY 1.10 Scientific Diving Standards Purpose The purpose of these scientific diving standards is to ensure scientific diving that is conducted under the auspices of the University of Miami (UM) is done in a manner that will maximize the protection of scientific divers from accidental injury and/or illness . The purpose is also to set forth standards for training , authorization, and certification that will allow a working reciprocity between UM and other O rganizational M embers (OMs ). Fulfillment of the se purposes shall be consistent with the furtherance of research and safety, and facilitation of collaborative opportunities between AAUS OMs. The AAUS manual sets minimum standards for the establishment of American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) recognized scientifi c diving programs, the organization for the conduct of these programs, and the basic regulations and procedures for safety in scientific diving operations . It also establishes a framework for reciprocity b etween AAUS OMs that adhere to these minimum sta ndards. The intention of the AAUS manual is to provide a foundation for OMs to build upon and expand. OMs are encouraged to exceed the minimal standards where they are able. Throughout this manual, the University of Miami ( UM) and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) is used synonymously. Historical Perspective The AAUS manual , which is the basis for this manual, was developed and written by AAUS by compiling the policies set forth in the diving manuals of several university, private, and governmental scientific diving programs . These programs share a common heritage with the scientific diving program at the Sc ripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) . Adherence to the SIO standards has proven both feasible and effe ctive in protecting the health and safety of scientific divers since 1954. This manual also reflects University of Miami program- specific policies and procedures, some of which were developed prior to the formation of AAUS and have since been refined to meet changes in techniques and technologies as scientific diving has evolved . In 1982, OSHA exempted scientific diving from commercial diving regulations (29CFR1910, Subpart T) under certain conditions that are outlined below . The final guidelines for the exemption became effective in 1985 (Federal Register, Vol. 50, No.6, p.1046) . AAUS is recognized by OSHA as the scientific diving standard setting organization. Scientific Diving Definition Scientific diving is defined (29CFR1910.402) as: \"Diving performed solely as a necessary part of a scientific, research, or educational activity by employees whose sole purpose for diving is to perform scientific research tasks. Scientific diving does not include performing any tasks usually associated with commercial diving such as: Placing or removing heavy objects underwater; inspection of pipelines and similar objects; construction; demolition; cutting or welding; or the use of explosives.\" Scientific Diving Exemption The two elements that a diving program must contain as defined by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910 Subpart T 1910.401(a)(2)(iii) are : a) Diving safety manual which includes at a minimum: Procedures covering all diving operations specific to the program; procedures for emergency care, including recompression and evacuation; and criteria for diver training and certification. b) Diving control (safety) board, with the majority of its members being active divers, which must at a minimum have the authority to: Approve and monitor diving projects; review and revise the diving safety manual; assure compliance with the manual; certify the depths to w hich a diver has been trained; take disciplinary action for unsafe practices; and, assure adherence to the buddy system (a diver is accompanied by and is in continuous contact with another diver in the water) for SCUBA diving. OSHA has granted an exemption for scientific diving from commercial diving regulations under the following guidelines (Appendix B to 29 CFR 1910 Subpart T ): 1. The Diving Control Board consists of a majority of active scientific divers and has autonomous and absolute authority over the s cientific diving program's operation. 2. The purpose of the project using scientific diving is the advancement of science; therefore, information and data resulting from the project are non- proprietary. 3. The tasks of a scientific diver are those of an observer and data gatherer . Construction and trouble -shooting tasks traditionally associated with commercial diving are not included within scientific diving. 4. Scientific divers, based on the nature of their activities, must use scientific expertise in studying the underwater environment and therefore, are scientists or scientists -in-training. Notifications of Changes to this Manual As pa rt of UM's annual scientific diving program report, the University of Miami will notify AAUS of any changes or modifications to this manual . 1.20 Operational Control University of Miami Auspices and Responsibilities UM auspices include any scientific diving operation in which the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science ( RSMAS) is connected because of ownership of life support equipment used, locations selected, or relationship with the individual(s) concerned. This includes all cases involving the operations of authorized individuals of UM or auxiliary organizations, where such individuals are acting within the scope of their authorization. Recreational diving is not within the scope of these auspices. It is UM's responsibility to adhere to the AAUS Standards for Scientific Diving certification, authorization, and operation of Scientific Diving Programs. The administration of the University of Miami's scientific diving program will reside with UM's Diving Control Board (DCB). The regulations herein must be observed at all locations where UM scientific diving is conducted. University of Miami Diving Safety Manual Meeting AAUS minimum standards is a requirement for organizational membership in the Academy. The University of Miami must develop and maintain a diving safety manual that includes wording on how UM defines specific policies and procedures required for the proper function of a scientific diving program . This manual must address environmental and working conditions unique to the program's operations . This manual must meet or exceed the AAUS standards. AAUS standards must be the foundation for the development of an OM's scientific diving safety manual. The order and f ormatting of the OM m anual does not have to conform to the AAUS template. The information contained in Volume 1, Sections 1.00 through 5.00 and the Appendices are required for all manuals . Volume 2, Sections 6.00 through 12.00 are required only when the OM conducts the specifically referenced diving mode or activity . Deviations or significant changes to AAUS minimum standards require justification before approval is granted by the AAUS Standards Committee. University of Miami Diving Control Board (UM DCB) The UM DCB must consist of a majority of active scientific divers . Voting members must include the Diving Safety Officer (DSO) and other representatives of the diving program such as qualified divers and members selected by procedures established by UM. A chairperson and a secretary may be chosen from the membership of the board according to UM procedure. The UM DCB h as autonomous and absolute authority over the scientific diving program's operation. The UM DCB must : o Establish additional standards, protocols, and operational procedures beyond the AAUS minimums to address UM -specific needs and concerns. o Approve and monitor diving projects. o Review and revise the diving safety manual. o Ensure compliance with this manual and AAUS . o Approve the depth s to which divers have been authorized to dive . o Take disciplinary action for unsafe practices. o Ensure adherence to the buddy system for scientific diving. o Act as the official representative of UM in matters concerning the scientific diving program. o Act as a board of appeal to consider diver -related matters . o Recommend the issue, reissue , or the revocation of diving authorizations. o Recommend changes in policy and amendments to AAUS and UM's diving safety manual as the need arises. o Establish and/or approve training protocols or standards through which the applicants for authorization can satisfy the requirements of this manual. o Suspend diving operations considered to be unsafe or unwise. o Establish criteria for equipment selection and use. o Recommend new equipment or t echniques. o Establish and/or approve facilities for the inspection and maintenance of diving and associated equipment. o Ensure that UM's air station(s) meet air quality standards as described in Section 3.70 . o Periodically review the performance of the DSO and program overall . The DSO will be made aware of votes pertaining to performance review and will recuse himself/herself from any vote(s) pertaining to DSO performance review(s). o Investigate diving incidents within UM's diving program or violations of this manual. The UM DCB may delegate operational oversight for portions of the program to the DSO; however, the UM DCB m ay not abdicate responsibility for the safe conduct of the diving program. University of Miami Diving Safety Officer (UM DSO) The UM DSO must be a member of the UM DCB. The UM DSO must vote in all voting matters. The UM DSO is designated as one of the OM Representatives to AAUS . This person should have broad technical expertise and experience in research related diving. Qualifications: 1. Must be an active scuba instructor from an internationally recognized certifying agency. 2. Must have logged a minimum of 500 dives, 300 of which are scientific dives. 3. Must be appointed by the responsible administrative officer or designee, with the advice and counsel of the DCB . 4. Must qualify as a Full Voting Member of AAUS as defined by AAUS Bylaws: a. \"Holds a diving certification from a recognized national certifying agency or equivalent, and b. Has engaged in sustained or successive scientific diving activities during the past two years, or c. Has completed a course in scientific diving that meets the requirements as specified by the most current edition of the AAUS Standards for Scientific Diving.\" 5. Must attend an AAUS DSO Orientation within one year of accepting the DSO position, unless he/she has served as a DSO for another current AAUS OM within the last year . 6. Should have a minimum of 3 years experience as a DSO or Assistant DSO at a current AAUS OM within the past 10 years. Duties and Responsibilities 1. Answers to the DCB and the appropriate admini strative officer or designee, for the conduct of the scientific diving program . 2. The routine operational authority for this program rests with the DSO as assigned by the DCB . This operational authority includes , but is not limited to : training, diver authorizations , approval of dive plans, maintenance of diving records, and ensuring compliance with this m anual . 3. May permit some duties and responsibilities to be carried out by a qualified delegate, with the approval of the DCB. 4. Must be guided in the performance of the required duties by the advice of the DCB, but operational authority for the conduct of the scientific diving program will be retained by the DSO. 5. Must suspend diving ope rations determined to be unsafe or unwise. Assistant Diving Safety Officer (ADSO) / Instructional Personnel Qualifications All personnel involved in diving instruction under UM's auspices must be reviewed and authorized by the DCB . Lead Diver For each dive , one individual must be designated as the Lead Diver who shall be at the dive location during the diving operation. To qualify as a lead diver, the diver must have a minimum of 50 career dives . Furthermore, no diver may lead a dive beyond his/her depth authorization. The Lead Diver is responsible for: Ensuring dives are conducted in accordance with Section 2.0 . Ensuring all dive team members possess current authorizations and are qualified for the type of diving operation. Coordination with other known activities in the vicinity that are likely to interfere with diving operations. Ensuring safety and emergency equipment is in working order and at the dive site. Suspending diving operations if in their opinion conditions are not safe. Reporting to the DCB , through the DSO, any physical problems or adverse physiological effects including symptoms of pressure -related injuries . Leading dive briefing(s) ( Section -dive safety check(s) ( Section 2.40 ). Reciprocity and Visiting Scientific Diver Two or more AAUS OM s engaged jointly in diving activities, or engaged jointly in the use of diving resources, must designate one of the participating DCB s to govern the joint dive project . However, responsibility for individual divers resides with the home OM . A Scientific Diver from one OM must apply for permission to dive under the auspices of another OM by submitting to the DSO of the host OM a document containing all the information listed in Appe ndix 4 , signed by the DSO or designee of the home DCB . A visiting Scientific Diver may be asked to demonstrate their knowledge and /or skills for the planned dive. If a host OM denies a visiting Scientific Diver permission to dive, the host DCB must notify the visiting Scientific Diver and their DCB with an explanation of all reasons for the denial. A letter of reciprocity (LOR) will not be issued unless all UM science diving requirements are current and up to date. A letter of reciprocity (LOR) is n ot equivalent to a verification of training letter (VOT). See Appendix 4 for a sample LOR template . An LOR confers insurance from the home institution to the scientific diver whereas the VOT provides proof of prior scientific diver training. Waiver of Requirements The UM DCB may grant a waiver for specific requirements including training, examinations, depth authorizations , and minimum activity to maintain authorizations . All options shall be exhausted to avoid using a waiver of requirements before the DCB considers waiving any requirement . The medical and insurance standards can not be waived. Divers requesting a waiver of a requirement may petition the DCB. To initiate this process, please submit in writing to the DSO a detailed description of the situation and justification for waiving a standard . The DSO will pass it on to the DCB for review. The DSO/DCB may contact the diver for additional information and to schedule a meeting if needed. 1.30 Consequence of Violation of Regulations by Scientific Divers Failure to comply with the regulations of this manual may be cause for the restriction or revocation of the diver's scientific diving authorization by action of the DCB . Violations will be handled on a case- by-case basis. 1.40 Consequences of Violation of Regulations by Organizational Members Failure to comply with the regulations of this manual may be cause for the restriction or revocation of UM's recognition by AAUS. 1.50 Record Maintenance UM must maintain consistent records for its diving program and for each participant. These records include but are not limited to: diving safety manual; equipment inspection, testing, and maintenance records; dive plans (project and/or individual) ; records of dive (project and/or individual) ; medical approval to dive; diver training records; diver authorization(s); individual dive log; dive incident reports; reports of disciplinary actions by the DCB; and other pertinent information deemed necessary by UM . Availability of Records: Medical records must be available to an attending physician of a diver or former diver when released in writing by the diver. Records and documents required by this m anual must be retained by UM for the following period: 1. Diving safety manual - Current document only . 2. Equipment inspection, testing, and maintenance records - Minimum current entry or tag . 3. Record s of Dive - Minimum of 1 year, except 5 years where there has been an incident of pressure -related injury. 4. Medical approval to dive - Minimum of 1 year past the expiration of the current document except 5 years where there has been an incident of pressure- related injury . 5. Diver training records - Minimum of 1 year beyond the life of the diver's program participation. 6. Diver authorization(s) - Minimum of 1 year beyond the life of the diver's program participation . 7. Pressure -related injury assessment - Minimum of 5 years . 8. Reports of disciplinary actions by the DCB - Minimum of 1 year beyond the life of the diver's program participation . SECTION 2.00 DIVING REGULATIONS 2.10 Introduction No person shall engage in scientific diving operations under the auspices of UM's scientific diving program unless they are authorized pursuant to the provisions of this manual . 2.20 Pre -Dive Procedures Dive Plans Before conducting any diving operations under the auspices of UM , a dive plan for the proposed project or dive must be formulated and submitted by the lead diver for approval by the DSO. Approval of a dive plan signifies that the dive may be conducted under UM auspices. Any diving conducted without the approval of a UM dive plan will not be considered a UM dive. Divers conducting dives without an approved dive plan or exceeding the paramet ers of an approved dive plan do so at their own risk and cannot hold the University of Miami, the UM DCB, the UM DSO, or the UM ADSO responsible in any way. Dives shall be planned around the competency of the least experienced /trained diver . The dive plan (project or individual) should include the following: Diving Mode(s) and Gas(es) Divers' authorizations Approximat e proposed Location(s) proposed dives Estimated depth(s) and bottom time(s) anticipated Decompression status and repetitive dive plans, if required Proposed work, equipment, and boats to be employed Any hazardous conditions anticipated Emergency Action P lan (Appendix 7 ) In water d etails of the dive plan should include: o Dive Buddy assignments and tasks o Goals and objectives o Maximum depth(s) and bottom time o Gas management plan o Entry, exit, descent and ascent procedures o Perceived environmental and operational hazards and mitigations o Emergency and diver recall procedures Dive Plan Submission In order to provide ample time to review and approve the dive plan to verify that all divers are qualified, current, authorized, and all paperwork is in order, dive plans shall be submitted to the UM DSO: 2 business days in advance for local dives (dives departing within 30 miles of RSMAS ) consisting only of UM science divers. 2 weeks in advance for non- local dives (dives departing greater than 30 miles of RSMAS ) consisting only of UM science divers. 1 mont h in advance for any dives including any non- UM diver, regardless of dive location. Diver Responsibility and Refusal to Dive The decision to dive is that of the diver . The ultimate responsibility for safety rests with the individual diver . It is the diver's responsibility and duty to refuse to dive, without fear of penalty, if in his/her judgment, conditions are unsafe or unfavorable, or if he/she would be violating the precepts of regulations in this manual . No dive team member will be required to be exposed to hyperbaric conditions against his/her will. No dive team member may dive for the duration of any known condition, which is likely to adversely affect the safety and health of the diver or other dive team members. Pre-dive Safet y Checks Prior to commencing the dive, the team must assure that every team member is healthy, fit, and trained for the type of dive that is being attempted . Scientific divers must conduct a functional check of their diving equipment in the presence of the dive buddy and/ or tender . They must ensure the equipment is functioning properly and suitable for the type of di ving operation being conducted. Each diver must have the capabili ty of achieving and maintaining positive buoyancy at the surface . Environmental conditions at the site must be evaluated prior to entering the water . Pre-dive Briefings Before conducting any diving operations under the auspices of the University of Miami, the dive team members must be briefed on: Goals and objectives of the dive Unification of dive team - dive buddy assignments and tasks, positioning underwater, communication Exposure to hyperbaric conditions - maximum depth and bottom time Environment - perceived environmental and operational hazards and mitigations Decompression - entry, exit, descent, and ascent procedures Gas management plan - turn pressure and required surfacing pressure Equipment check - check mask, functionality of bot h second stages, hose routing, inflator functionality, OPV functionality, deflator functionality, starting tank pressure, fins, and any additional equipment necessary for the dive Emergency and diver recall procedures Environme ntal Conditions Before diving, environmental conditions must be assessed. It is the responsibility of the lead diver to do an environmental assessment before the day of the dive. The lead diver will monitor the weather and diving conditions and will notify divers ASAP of changes in the dive plan. The decision to dive or cancel the dive will sometimes have to be made the day of the dive. Guidelines for canceling dives based on environmental condit ions are listed below: When diving offshore and winds are expected to be greater than 15kts and/or seas are expected to be greater than 2- 4ft wave height, dives should be cancel led. Dives shall be cancelled when a small craft caution or greater is issued by NOAA. Other environmental conditions or hazards may also be cause for a cancellation of a dive(s). 2.30 Diving Procedures Solo Diving Prohi bition All diving activitie s must assure adherence to the buddy system . This buddy system is based upon mutual assistance, especially in the case of an emergency . Solo diving is not permitted under the auspices of UM. Decompression Management On any given dive, both divers in the buddy pair must follow the most conservative dive profile . A safety stop performed between 10 -20ft during the ascent phase of the dive should be conducted on any dive that exceeds 30 fsw (9. 14m) . Other ascent strategies (half stops, etc.) approved by the DS O may be used . Half stops are recommended for any dives deeper than 60ft. Ascent Rate The maximum ascent rate for diving under the auspices of the University of Miami is 30 feet per minute. Alcohol Consumption No dives shal l be conducted for 12 hours after consumption of alcohol. UM recommends not consuming any alcohol within 12 hours of surfacing from a dive. When alcohol has been consumed within 24 hours of commencement of a dive, it is the diver's responsibility to do a self assessment for fitness to div e prior to diving . Termination of the Dive Any dive mu st be terminated while there is still sufficient cylinder pressure to permit the diver to safely reach the surface, including decompression time, or to safely reach an additional gas source at the decompression station. It is the responsibility of the diver to terminate the dive that he/she considers unsafe, without fear of reprisal , in a way that does not compromise the safety of another diver already in the water. Emergencies and Deviations from Regulations Any diver may deviate from the requirements of this manual to the extent necessary to prevent or minimize a situation likely to cause death, serious physical harm, or major environmental damage . A written report must be submitted to the UM DCB explaining the circumstances and justifications. 2.40 Post -Dive Procedures Post-Dive Safety Checks After the completion of a dive, each diver must report any physical problems, symptoms of decompression illness , or equipment malfunctions to the Lead D iver, which shall then be reported to the DSO and/or DCB . 2.50 Emergency Procedures The University of Miami has developed emergency procedures that follow the standards of care of the community and include procedures and implementation criteria for emergency care, recompression , evacuation , and incident reporting . The emergency action plan developed by UM can be found in Appendix 7 . 2.60 Flying After Diving or Ascending to Altitude (Over 1000 feet /304 meters ) The flying after diving regulations below have been adopted from recommendations developed by the Diver's Alert Network. Following a Single No -Decompression Dive: Divers should have a minimum preflight surface interval of 12 hours. Following Multiple Dives per Day or Multiple Days of Diving: Divers should have a minimum preflight surface interval of 18 hours. Following Div es Requiring Decompression Stops: Divers should have a minimum preflight surface interval of 24 hours. Befo re Ascending to Altitude Above 1000 feet (304 meters) : Divers should follow the appropriate guideline for preflight surface intervals unless the decompression procedure used has accounted for the increase in elevation. 2.70 Record Keeping Requirements Personal Diving Log Each authorized scientific diver must log every dive made under UM auspices and is encouraged to log all other dives . Logs must be submitted in the online dive logging website in a timely manner (within one month of the date of the dive) and must remain in the diver 's online file. The dive log should include at least the following: Name of diver and buddy Date, time, and location Diving modes used General nature of diving activities Maximum depth and dive time Diving tables or computers used Detailed report of any near or actual incidents Required Incident Reporting All diving incidents requiring recompression treatment, or resulting in moderate o r serious injury, or death must be reported to the UM DCB and AAUS in a timely manner . UM must record and report occupational injuries and illnesses in accordance with requirements of the appropriate Labor Code section. UM must investigate and document any incident of pressure - related injury and prepare a report that is to be forwarded to AAUS during the annual reporting cycle . If pressure -related injuries are suspected, or if symptoms are evident, the following additional information must be recorded and retained by UM , with the record of the dive, for a period of 5 years . Written descriptive report shall include : Name, address, phone numbers of the principal parties involved. Summary of experience of divers involved. Location, description of dive site, and description of conditions that led up to incident. The circumstances of the incident and the extent of any injuries or illnesses. Description of symptoms, including depth a nd time of onset. Description and results of treatment. Disposition of case. Recommendations to avoid repetition of incident. In addition to requirements specific to the University of Miami , all diving incidents will be reported to AAUS . This report must first be reviewed and released by the DCB and at a minimum contain: Complete AAUS Incident Report . Summary of experience of divers involved. Description of dive site, and description of conditions that led up to incident. The circumstances of the incident and the extent of any injuries or illnesses. Description of symptoms, including depth and time of onset. Description and results of treatment. Disposition of case. Recommendations to avoid repetition of incident. SECTION 3.00 DIVING EQUIPMENT 3.10 General Policy All equipment must meet standards as determined by the DSO and the DCB . All equipment must be regularly examined by the person using it and serviced according to manufacturer recommendations . Equipment that is subjected to extreme usage under adverse conditions may require more frequent testing and maintenance. UM-owned equipment may only be used when diving under the auspices of the University of Miami as defined in Section 1.20 . 3.20 Equipment The UM DCB must establish the minimum equipment configuration for all dives. Regulators , Gauges , and Computers Scuba regulators and gauges must be inspected and functionally tested prior to each use and serviced , at a minimum, according to manufacturer's recommendations . Standard open circuit (OC) regulator configuration is: A first stage Primary 2nd stage Back up 2nd stage Submersible P ressure Gauge (SPG) Inflator hose for a Buoyancy C ompensator D evice A Full Face Mask may be used in place of the primary 2nd stage according to manufacturer's recommendations and pending approval by the DSO/DCB to use a full face mask. Divers may use dive computers to track depth and time of dives but a ny diver using a dive computer to control his/her dive profile must be approved to use that specific model. To be authorized to use a dive computer, divers must demonstrate understanding of UM dive computer policy by taking a written quiz and demonstrate mastery of the computer model through a practical evaluation of the DSO or designee. Any diver using a regulator hose longer than 36 inches must receive approval by the UM DSO. Divers are not permitted to use an upstream valve style second stage regulator. Equipment for Determination of Decompression Status (Dive Computers and Dive Tables) Each member of the buddy team must h ave an underwater timing device and depth indicator , or dive computer . Timing devices and depth gauges must not be shared underwater. Dive computers must not be used to control the dive profile by more than one diver during any 18 hour period. To be authorized to use a dive computer under the auspices of UM, a diver must: Review the online dive computer authorization C omputer B ased Learning (CBL) module in Blackboard . Complete a written exam demonstrating understanding of basic dive computer principles and policies. Review the owner's manual for the computer model to be used. Comple te a practical demonstration of knowledge and understanding of the specific computer model to be used, including all menus, functions, settings, buttons, icons, alarms, etc. A set of UM DCB approved dive tables must be available at the dive location . A dive computer must accompany a diver on every dive within an 18 hour period preceding any dive where the computer will control the dive profile. In an aquarium or other manmade structure of a known maximum obtainable depth: o A depth indicator is not required, except when a diver's decompression status must be taken into consideration on repetitive div es. o Only one buddy must be equipped with a timing device. o The maximum obtainable depth of the aquarium must be used as the diving depth. Scuba C ylinders Scuba cylinders must be designed, constructed, and mainta ined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders. Scuba cylinders must be hydrostatically tested in accordance with DOT standards. Scuba cylinders must have an internal and external inspection at intervals not to exceed 12 months. Scuba cylinder valves must be functionally tested at intervals not to exceed 12 months. Scuba cylinder pressures should not drop below 500PSI during diving operations. Double cylinders - The use of double cylinders requires authorizati on through the DSO that shall include: a lecture, a training dive, and demonstrate proficiency diving with double cylinders on a checkout dive. When a diver presents equivalent training, only a checkout dive demonstrating proficiency may be required. Steel cylinders require redundant buoyancy . When diving in salt water in a wetsuit without redundant buoyancy , aluminum tanks must be used. Buoyancy Compensation Devices (BCD) Each diver must have the capability of achieving and maintaining neutral buoyancy underwater and positive buoyancy at the surface . BCDs, dry suits, or other variable volume buoyancy compensation devices must be equipped with an exhaust valve. These devices must be functionally inspected and tested at intervals not to exceed 12 months. BCDs , dry suits, or other variable volume buoyancy compensation devices must not be used as a lifting device in lieu of lift bags . Dive Weight The maximum amount of non- ditchable weight a diver may wear is 10 pounds. UM backplates account for 6 pounds of non- ditchable weight. Any amount of weight that exceeds 10 pounds must be able to be easily removed and released from the diver. When double alu minum tanks are used, the maximum amount of non- ditchable weight is 14 pounds. Weight belts must be worn so that the buckle is able to be released with the right hand. 3.30 Auxiliary Equipment Handheld U nderwater P ower T ools Power tools and equipment used underwater must be specifically approved for this purpose. Tools and equipment supplied with power from the surface must be de -energized before being placed into or retrieved from the water. Handheld power tools must not be suppl ied with power from the dive location until requested by the diver. 3.40 Support Equipment First Aid Supplies A first aid kit and emergency oxygen appropriate for the diving being conducted should be available at the dive site. Diver's Flag A diver's flag must be displayed prominently in accordance with local regulations whenever diving is conducted under circumstances where required or where water traffic is probable. Compressor Systems - UM Controlled The following will be considered in design and location of compressor systems: Low-pressure compressors used to supply air to the diver if equipped with a volume tank must have a check valve on the inlet side, a relief valve, and a drain valve. Compressed air systems over 5 00 psig must have slow -opening shut -off valves. All air compressor intakes must be located away from areas containing exhaust or other contaminants. Lift Bags Divers are not permitted to use lift bags with greater than 50 pounds of positive buoyancy. Divers must receive proper training and be authorized by the UM DSO to use a lift bag . Training must include a lecture from the DSO (or proof of formal academic training) and a checkout dive demonstrating proper safe use of lift bags. For any dive where a lift bag is intended to be used, divers must include the use of lift bags in dive plans. Diver Propulsion Vehicles DPVs are electronically powered device used to transport divers through the water. They are primarily used to benefit divers on lar ge dive s ites or sites with strong currents as an alternative to a diver swimming/finning. Divers interested in conducting dives using a DPV must at minimum : Be current UM scientific divers Attend a lecture by the DSO covering theoretical and pract ical considerations for DPV use Complete at least one DPV checkout dive with the DSO Miscellaneous Support Equipment Any equipment or equipment technique including but not limited to double cylinders , DPV's, etc. requires approval for use by the DSO. 3.50 Use of University of Miami Equipment Divers are responsible for any and all UM equipment they borrow or are assigned. This includes the equipment care, maintenance, and return at the end of usage. If a piece of equipment is damaged, lost, stolen, or in any way returned in a condition other than the condition received from the DSO, divers will be financially responsible for its repair or replacement. Equipment is expected to be returned within a week of your last planned dive unless other arrangements have been made with the DSO. Divers are responsible for notifying the DSO of any equipment maintenance issues and bringing the equipment in need of repair to the DSO as soon as possible for repair or replacement. Divers -In-Training are not permitted to use DSO issued gear for proficiency di ves until they are fully authorized. Using UM DSO issued gear for recreational diving is not permitted. 3.60 Equipment Maintenance Record Keeping Each equipment modification, repair, test, calibration, or maintenance ser vice must be logged, including the date and nature of work performed, serial number of the item (if applicable) , and the name of the person performing the work for the following equipment: Regulators Gauges (SPG, Depth Gauges, Timers, and D ive C omputers ) BCDs Dry suits Scuba cylinders and valves Full Face Masks Compressors , air filtration systems , gas control panels, and storage banks Surface supplied equipment Rebreather systems Additional equipment categories as determined by the DCB Compressor Operation and Air Test Records Gas analyses and air tests must be performed on each UM -controlled breathing air compressor at regular intervals of no more than 100 hours of operation or 6 months, whichever occurs first . The results of these tests must be entered in a formal log and be maintained. 3.70 Air Quality Standards Breathing Gas Breathing gas must meet the following specifications as set forth by the Compressed Gas Association (CGA Pamphlet G -7.1; see table below ). CGA Grade E Component Maximum Oxygen 20 - 22%/v Carbon Monoxide 10 PPM/v Carbon Dioxide 1000 PPM/v Condensed Hydroca rbons 5 mg/m3 Total Hydrocarbons as Methane 25 PPM/v Water Vapor ppm (2) Objectionable Odors None For breathing air used in conjunction with s elf-contained breathing apparatus in extreme cold where moisture can condense and freeze, causing the breathing apparatus to malfunction, a dew point not to exceed - 50\u00b0F (63 pm v/v) or 10 degrees lower than the coldest temperature expected in the area is required. Remote /Non -UM-Based Operations For remote site operations using gas sources not controlled by UM , every effort should be made to verify breathing gas meets the requirements of this standard. If CGA Grade E gas is not verifiable, the DCB must develop a protocol to mitigate risk to the diver. SECTION 4.00 SCIENTIFIC DIVER CERTIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATIONS This section describes the training and performance standards for the University of Miami Scientific Divers and represent s the minimum required level of knowledge and skills presented in a generalized format . AAUS requires OM diving programs to use the AAUS manual as the foundation of standards/policies in their programs . OMs are encouraged to exp and upon, customize, and augment these requirements, develop or utilize appropriate educational materials, and optimize instructional programs to suit and reflect their specific needs. The University of Miami has followed this recommendation by AAUS. 4.10 Prerequisi tes Administrati ve The candidate must complete all administrative and legal documentation required by the O M. Entry Level Diver (Recreational Certification ) The candidate must, at minimum, show documented proof of Diver C ertification or equivalent from an internationally recognized training agency. When entering the UM scientific diving program, t he diver candi date must present a dive log showing the successful completion of at least 10 dives, 2 of which must be within 12 months of the first day of science diver training. Entry level diver training is a prerequisite to scientific diver tra ining and therefore no part of entry level training may be counted in any way toward scientific diver training. 1 \"Minimum Course Content for Open Water Diver Certification\" - World Recreational Scuba Training Council (WRSTC), www.wrstc.com . 2 \"Safety related minimum requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers -- Part 2: Level 2 -- Autonomous diver\" . ISO 24801- 2:2007 - International Organization for Standardization (ISO) - www.iso.org. Medical Examination The candidate must be medically qualified for diving as described in Section 5.0 and A ppendices 1-4 of this manual . AAUS medical standards may not be waived. Swimming/Watermanship Evaluation The candidate must demonstrate the following in the presence of the DSO or designee. All tests are to be performed without swim aids . However, where exposure protection is needed, the candidate must be appropriately weighted to provide for neutral buoyancy. Due to the physical fitness component, elements 1- 5 of the swim test must be completed on the same day . Divers who pass less than 60% of the swim test (excluding transport of a passive person) will be asked to take it at a later date after they have had a chance to work on their swimming. 1) Swim 400 yards ( 366 meters) without swim aids except goggles in less than 12 minutes . This is a continuous swim so stopping is not permitted. Any stroke may be used. 2) Tread water for 15 minutes with no added swim aids or floatation. 3) Surface dive to 15ft. Goggles or mask are permitted. 4) Swim 25 yards underwater on a single breath. A diver candidate will receive a PASS for the U/W swim when completing 100% of the distance completely underwater. a) The underwater swim must be completed without pushing off the wall. b) Weights may be used for the underwater swim if needed to stay completely submerged. If weights are used for the u/w swim, the diver candidate must use the same amount of weight for the 15 minute water tread. c) Diver candidate may attempt the underwater swim 3 times before being asked to move on to the next element of the swim test. 5) Swim 400 yards (366 meters) in less than 8 minutes with mask, fins, and snorkel, but without the use of arms. 6) Transport a passive person of equal size a distance of 25 yards (23 meters) in the water. This element of the swim test may be completed at a later date. 4.20 Training The diver candidate must succes sfully complete prerequisites, theoretical aspects, practical training, and examinations for a minimum cumulative time of 100 hours and a minimum of 12 open water dives . Theoretical aspects must include principles and activities appropriate to the intended area of scientific study . Formats for meeting the 100 hour training requirement include the UM scientific diver training course or a combination of formalized and on the job training. Under some conditions the DSO or qualified instructor designee may supervise in- water training from the surface after the fourth training dive as long as he/she is fit and equipped to enter the water to provide immediate assistance in case of an emergency . There should not be more than 6 students per DSO or qualified instructor designee (6:1 ratio) during any in- water diver training session. Regardless of how many DSOs or instructor designees are available, in -water training sessions must not exceed 12 diver candidates. Due to the physical nature of dive training and related activities, physical contact is common . Instructors may need to make physical contact in order to correct diving technique or otherwise provide instruction. Divers shall understand that at times, for proper instruction and safety, physical contact is required and necessary. When a diver 's resume provides clear evidence of significant scientific diving experience, the diver can be given credit for meeting portions of the 100 hour course requirements. The DCB /DSO will identify specific overlap between on- the-job training, previous scientific diving training/experience and course requirements, and then determine how potential deficiencies will be resolved. However, the University of Miami cannot \"test -out\" divers, regardless of experience, when they have no previous experience in scientific diving. Any candidate who does not convince the DCB, through the DSO , that he/she possesses the necessary judgment, under diving conditions, for the safety of the diver and his/her buddy , may be denied UM scientific diving privileges.

Diver- In-Training (DIT) Authorization This is a temporary authorization to dive, usable only while it is current and for the purpose intended. This authorization signifies that a diver has completed and been certified as at least an entry level recreational diver through an internationally recognized certifying agency and has the knowledge , skills , and experience necessary to commence and continue training as a sci entific diver under supervision, as approved by the D CB. DIT status must only be used when the diver is on his/her way to becoming a scientific diver . While it is recommended for DIT's to have hands -on scientific diver experience during their training, th e DIT status is intended to be a temporary authorization, not a substitute for Scientific Diver Authorization. DITs may dive with a project to 30ft or shallower after completing a minimum of 10 dives with the DSO. The divers will be considered a DIT until all authorization and program requirements are satisfactorily met. DITs may dive deeper than their authorization depth or be introduced to specialized equipment and techniques with the DSO during training to achieve training goal s. These training/experience dives may not result in depth or specialized dive technology/technique authorization. DITs are permitted to use UM owned gear for interns hips, project dives, etc. prior to final grade submission (if enrolled in the scientific diving course), pending approval of a dive plan. UM Scientific Diver Authorization Science diver authorization s ignifies a diver has completed all requirements in Section 4.20 and is authorized by the University of Mia mi to engage in scientific diving without supervision, as approved by the DCB through the DSO. Submission of documents and participation in aptitude examinations does not automatically result in authorization. To be authorized, the applicant must demonstrate to the DCB, through the DSO, that s/he is sufficiently skilled and proficient, and possess the necessary judgement for their safety and/or that of the dive team. Scientific Diver Authorization is only active when required elements are in place and current . Scientific Aquarium Diver Certification Scientific Aquarium Diver is a certification authorizing the diver to participate in scientific diving solely in the aquarium environment. All requirements set forth for Scientific Diver certification must apply, except follows: Practical training must include at least 12 supervised aquarium dives for a cumulative bottom time of 6 hours. Training requiremen ts for navigation and 400- yard (366- meter) surface swim in scuba gear may be waived at the discretion of the DCB. Temporary Diver Authorization Only a diver not under the auspices of an AAUS OM may be granted a Temporary Diver Authorization. T he individual in question must demonstrate proficiency in diving and can contribute measurably to a planned dive . A T emporary D iver A uthorization constitutes a waiver of selected requirements of Section 4.0 and is valid only for a limited time, as approved by the DCB . A Temporary Diver Authorization must be restricted to the planned diving operation and must comply with all other policies, regulations, and standards of this manual , including medical requirements. This authorization is not to be utilized as a repeated mechanism to circumvent existing standards set forth in this manual . 4.31 Ways to Become a UM Scientific Diver Credited Scientific Diver Course RSM500 / RSM600 This 3 -credit course offered at RSMAS meets or exceeds all AAUS training requirements . This is the preferred method to become a UM scientific diver. Basic Diver Checkout Procedure In the event a UM student, staff, or faculty member's need for diving author ization cannot wait for the next scientific diving course, the diver may be permitt ed by discretion of the DSO and DCB, to complete the Basic Diver Checkout Procedure on a one -to-one basis with the DSO or designee. Upon completing this procedure, the diver will be authorized to dive as a 30ft DIT with special provisions to be set by the DSO. This procedure is not to be utilized as a repeated mechanism to circumvent existing standards set forth in this m anual; this individual will be required to enroll in and pass the next available scientific diving course. The diver will be authorized to dive as a 30ft DIT up on successful completion of all of the following: Demonstrate proficiency in UM scientific diving program policies and procedures Present a current dive physical approved by a physician (this cannot be waived) Submit a diver resume Provide proof of insurance for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (this cannot be waived) Sign and submit the Statement of Understanding Copy of dive log showing 10 open water dives (2 in the last 12 months) Proof of diver certification Current E mergency C are T raining (ECT) qualification Consent to Treat and Medical History form (different than dive physical) Complete HazMat training Demonstrate ability to plan dives to UM standards Pass the swim test Pass a pool checkout dive at the discretion of the DSO/DCB demonstrating basic diving skills. Pass an open water checkout dive demonstrating the following: o Regulator recovery and replacement underwater o Mask removal and replacement underw ater o BCD ditch and don underwater o Weight system removal and replacement underwater o Out of air procedures as both donor and receiver underwater o Proper entry and exit o Proper BCD use o Proper ascent/descent o Rescue procedures o All underwater skills must be performed with satisfactory buoyancy, awareness, stability, and trim (BAST) Experienced Diver Checkout Procedure Experienced divers may qualify for this procedure in one of two ways . 1) Provide proof of at least 50 logged scientific dives or 2) provide proof of 50 logged dives in varying conditions with advanced recreational training . This procedure can be done one -on-one with the DSO or designee, or as part of a scientific diving course in progress . Divers that complete this procedure are not permitted to act as the Lead Diver for their first 12 scientific dives . The 11 dives after the checkout dive must be conducted under supervision of a qualified science diver under UM auspices . Upon completion, unlike the Basic Diver Checkout Procedure whe re the diver will be a DIT, a diver who completes the Experienced Diver Checkout Procedure will be authorized to the 30ft or 60ft level, based on the DSO's evaluation and the diver's past experience. In order to complete the Experienced Diver Checkout Proc edure, the diver must: Complete all requirements listed above for Basic Diver Checkout Procedure Show proof of at least 50 total logged dives Pass a written exam which includes sections on equipment, physiology, physics, rescues, dive accident management, dive planning, dive tables, navigation, first aid, environment, and UM policies and pr ocedures . Overall p assing score is 80%. F urthermore , divers must pass each section with a score of at least 80%. 4.40 Depth Authorizations Depth Ratings and Progression to Next Depth Level The d epth rating i ndicates the maximum depth in which a diver can conduct science and may supervise other divers holding a shallower depth authorization. A scientific diver requires a valid depth authorization to be considered active. Divers may not lead dives beyond the depth they are authorized to dive. A diver may be authorized to the next depth level after successf ully completing the requirements for that level. A diver may exceed his/her depth authorization by one level when accompanied and supervised by a dive buddy holding a depth authorization greater or equal to the intended depth. Only in inst ances of science diver training when divers are being supervised by the UM DSO will divers be permitted to exceed their depth authorization by more than one level. Dives must be planned and executed with the permission of the DCB or designee. In the event a diver within UM does not hold an authorization at the desired next level, the DCB has endorsed the procedure below based on AAUS standards for a diver to attain a deeper authorization. The total number of dives to obtain a given depth authorization must follow the cumulative number of dives listed below. To lead dives, a diver must have a minimum of 50 career dives. No diver may lead a dive beyond his/her depth authorization. a) Authorization to 30 Foot Depth - Initial science diver depth authorization, approved upon the successful completion of training listed in Section 4.00 . Cumulative minimum supervised dives: 12. b) Authorization to 60 Foot Depth - A diver holding a 30- foot authorization may be authorized to a depth of 60 feet after successfully completing and logging 12 supervised dives to depths between 31 and 60 feet under supervision of a diver authorized by the DCB , for a minimum total time of 4 hours. Up to 4 dives between 31 -40ft and up to 4 dives between 41 -50ft may be counted toward the 12 dives. Minimum total bottom time for div es between 51 -60ft must be at least 1 hour.

Have proof of current dive accident insurance on file. Pass HazMat training every 3 years to be able to handle scuba cylinders. Maintain current emergency care training (see below). During any 12- month period, each scientific diver must log a minimum of 12 scientific, scientific training, or proficiency dives . At least one dive must be logged near the maximum depth, as defined by the DCB, of the diver's authorization during each 6- month period. Divers authorized to 150 feet or deeper may satisfy these requirements with dives to 130 feet or deeper as long as divers are diving using the same equipment, techniques, and dive planning methods required for their max authorization depth. Divers authorized beyond 300 feet may satisfy these requirements with dives to 200 feet or deeper as long as divers are di ving using the same equipment, techniques, and dive planning methods required for their max authorization depth. For specialized diving environments, modes, and authorizations, at least one dive in the environment or using the mode, must be logged during e ach 6 -month period. o For nitrox divers, reference Section 6.20 . o For rebreather use rs, reference Section 11.50 and Appendix 4 . Failure to meet these requirements will result in suspension, revocation, or restriction of authorization by the DSO under procedures established by the DCB. Requalification of Authorization Once the initial requirements of Section 4.00 are met, divers whose depth authorization has lapsed due to lack of activity may be requalified by the DCB/DSO after a review of the diver's authorization requirements. If a diver fails to meet the minimum diving requirements to stay active, then a checkout dive must be completed in order to become active again (except nitrox authorization - see Section 6.20 ). Divers that ar e more than 3 years out of currency in a ny given authorization may be required to complete additional requirements beyond a checkout dive to requalify . If a UM diver's authorization has lapsed by mor e than 5 years, the diver will be required to re -enter the program as a new diver to the program . In the event of a medical condition, procedure, etc. where a diver is hospitalized overnight for any reason, the diver must obtain explicit written permission from a physician that he/she is medically fit and cleared for scuba diving. Checkout Dive Procedure During the checkout dive procedure, di vers will be required to complete the pre -checkout dive preparation process . Checkout dives are conducted by the DSO . Details of this procedure can also be found on Blackboard . Divers shall: 1. Submit a dive plan online 2. Review the online modules and demonstr ation videos on Blackboard 3. Participate in a dive plan briefing 4. Have a discussion with the DSO about dive rescues 5. Perform skills dur ing the dive ( Section 4.31 Basic Diver Checkout Procedure) 6. Participate in a dive debrief Underwater, divers are evaluated on their Buoyancy, Awareness, Stability, and Trim (BAST) over the course of the dive . Each BAST element is scored on a 1- 5 scale. In order to pass, divers must earn a minimum score of 12. If the diver earns a score of 1 on any BAST element, the diver will not pass the checkout dive, the DSO will provide corrective feedback, and a remediation plan will be developed. Medical Examination All scientific divers must pass a medical examination at the intervals specified in Section 5.0 . A medically cleared diver experiencing any Conditions Which May Disqualify Candidates F rom Diving ( Appendix 2 ) must receive clearance to return to diving from a physician before resuming diving activities . This medical examination requirement cannot be waived for any diver. Emergency Care Training (ECT) The scientific diver must hold current training in the following: Adult CPR and AED Emergency oxygen administration First aid for diving accidents Blood Borne Pathogens Hazardous Marine Life Neurological Exam The UM DCB -approved course that meets the industry standard is the Diver's Alert Network Diving First Aid for Professional Divers (DFAPro). Details of this procedure can also be found on Blackb oard . UM science divers must maintain a current DAN DFAPro certification to stay active . Additionally, 12 months after the certification is issued, divers must refresh emergency care training skills with a quiz and a practical demonstration of CPR, AED , and oxygen administration. 4.60 Revocation of Authorization An individual's scientific diver authorization can be restricted or revoked for cause by the DCB. Specific a uthorizations associated with an individual's scientific diver authorization may be restricted or suspended for cause by the DCB . Restrictions or suspensions issued by the DCB may be rescinded by the DCB ; these issues will be reviewed by the DCB and the outcomes or actions resulting from this review will be documented in the diver's record. Violations of regulations set forth in this manual or other governmental subdivisions not in conflict with this manual , or demonstration of poor judgement, may be considered cause . The DCB or designee must inform the diver in writing of the reason(s) for revocation. The diver will be given the opportunity to present their case in writing to the DCB for reconsideration. Following revocation the diver may be reauthorized after complying with conditions the DCB may impose . All such written statements and requests, as identified in this section, are formal documents, and therefore part of the diver's file. SECTION 5.00 MEDICAL STANDARDS 5.10 Medical Requirements General All med ical evaluations required by this manual must be performed by, or under the direction of, a licensed physician of the applicant -diver's choice, preferably one trained in diving/undersea medicine. The diver should be free of any chronic disabling disease and any conditions contained in the list of conditions for which restrictions from diving are generally recommended. ( Appendix 2 ) UM must verify that divers have been declared by the examining medical authority to be fit to engage in diving activities . 5.20 Frequency of Medical Evaluations Medical evaluation must be completed: Before Age 40 After age 40 Before Age 60 After Age 60 Before a diver may begin diving, unless an equivalent initial medical evaluation has been given within the preceding 5 years Before a diver may begin diving, unless an equivalent initial medical evaluation has been given within the preceding 3 years Before a diver may begin diving , unless an equivalent initial medical evaluation has been given within the preceding 2 years At 5-year intervals At 3-year intervals At 2-year intervals Clearance to return to diving must be obtained from a healthcare provider following a medically cleared diver experiencing any Conditions Which May Disqualify Candidates From Diving ( Appendix 2 ), or following any major injury or illness, or any condition requiring chronic medication. If the condition is pressure related, the clearance to return to diving must come from a physician trained in diving medicine. 5.30 Information Provided Examining Physician The diver being evaluated must provide a copy of the medical evaluation requirements of this manual to the examining physician. (Appendices 1 , 2, and 3 ). 5.40 Content of Medical Evaluations Medical examinations conducted initially and at the intervals sp ecified in Section 5.20 must consist of the following: 1. Diving physical examination ( Appendix 2 ). Modifications or omissions of required tests are not permitted 2. Applicant agreement for release of medical information to the Diving Safety O fficer and the DCB ( Appendix ) 5.50 Physician's Written Report A Medical Evaluation of Fitness For Scuba Diving Report signed by the examining physici an stating the individual's fitness to dive, including any recommended restrictions or limitations will be submitted to the DSO for the diver's rec ord after the examination is completed. The Medical Evaluation of Fitness For Scuba Diving Report will be reviewed by the DCB or designee and the diver's record and authorizations will be updated accordingly. A copy of any physician's written reports will be made available to the individual. It is the diver's responsibility to provide to the DSO a written statement from the examining medical authority listing any restrictions, limitations, or clearances to dive resulting from medical examinations obtaine d by the individual outside of their normal diving medical examination cycle. These statements will be reviewed by the DCB or designee and the diver's record and authorizations will be updated accordingly. Volume 2 Sections 6.00 through 12.00 SECTION 6.00 NITROX DIVING This section describes the requirements for authorization and use of nitrox for Scientific Diving . 6.10 Requirements for Nitrox Authorization Prior to authorization to use nitrox, the following minimum requirements must be met: Prerequisites Only authorized UM science divers and UM DITs are eligible for authorization to use nitrox . Submission of documents and participation in aptitude examinations does not automatically result in authorization to use nitrox . The applicant must convince the DCB through the DSO that he/she is sufficiently knowledgeable, skilled , and proficient in the theory and use of nitrox for diving . Divers who hold a nitrox certification from an internationally recognized training agency must do the following in order to be authorized to use nitrox under UM auspices: 1. Submit a copy of recreational nitrox certification 2. Pass a written examination with a minimum score of 80% 3.

Calculation of Decompression Status A set of DCB approved nitrox dive tables should be available at the dive site. Dive computers may be used to compute decompression status during nitrox dives if the diver has been authorized to use the specific dive computer model . Manufacturers' guidelines and operation instructions as well as the guidelines in this manual must be followed. Dive computers capable of pO 2 limit and fO 2 adjustment should be checked by the diver prior to the start each dive to ensure conformity with the mix being used. Gas Mixture Requirements Nitrox may be mixed by partial pressure , blending stick, or a membrane system. Nitrox gas mixtures range from 22- 99%.UM personnel mixing nitrox must be qualified and approved by the DCB (through the DSO) for the method(s) used. Oxygen used for mixing nitrox should meet the purity levels for \"Medical Grade\" (U.S.P.) or \"Aviator Grade\" standards. In addition to the AAUS /UM Air Purity Guidelines outlined in Section 3 .60, any air that ma y come in contact with oxygen concentrations greater than 40% (i.e.. during mixing), must also have a hydrocarbon contaminant no greater than .01 mg/m3. o For remote site operations using compressors not controlled by UM wher e this is not verifiable, the DCB will develop a project -specific protocol to mitigate risk to the diver . Analysis Verification by User Prior to a dive, each diver must analyze the oxygen content of his/her scuba cylinder and acknowledge in writing the following information for each cylinder: fO 2, MOD, cylinder pressure, date of analysis, and user's name. Divers may not use any nitrox cylinder unless he/she has personally verified its contents using an oxygen analyzer. Individual dive log reporting forms should report fO 2 of nitrox used, if different than 21%. 6.40 Nitrox Diving Equipment Required Equipment All of the designated equipment and stated requirements regarding scuba equipment required in this manual apply to nitrox operations. Additional minimal equipment necessary for nitrox diving operations includes: Labeled SCUBA Cylinders in Accordance with Industry Standards Oxygen Analyzers Oxygen compatible equipment as applicable Requirement for Oxygen Service All equipment, which during the dive or cylinder filling process is exposed to concentrations greater than 40% oxygen, should be cleaned and maintained for oxygen service. Any e quipment used with oxygen or mixtures containing over 40% by volume oxygen must be designed and maintained for oxygen service . Oxygen systems over 125 psig must have slow - opening shut -off valves . Compressor system Compressor/filtration system must produce oil -free air , or An oil -lubricated compressor placed in service for a nitrox system should be checked for oil and hydrocarbon contamination at least quarterly. SECTION 7.00 SURFACE SUPPLIED DIVING TECHNOLOGIES Surface supplied diving technologies include any diving mode in which a diver at depth is supplied with breathing gas from the surface. 7.10 Prerequisites All surface supplied and hookah divers must be certified scientific divers or divers in training and have completed system specific training as authorized by UM . 7.20 Surface Supplied Diving Surface Supply Definition A mode of diving using open circuit, surface supplied, compressed gas delivered by means of a pressurized umbilical hose. The umbil ical generally consists of a gas supply hose, strength member, pneumofathometer hose, and communication line. The umbilical supplies a helmet or full -face mask, often with voice communications. Procedures Each diver must be continuously tended while in the water. A diver must be stationed at the underwater point of entry when diving is conducted in enclosed or physically confined spaces. Each diving operation must have a primary breathing gas supply sufficient to support divers for the duration of the planned dive including decompression. For dives deeper than 100fsw (30 m) or outside the no- decompression limits: o A separate dive team member must tend each diver in the water; o A standby diver must be available while a diver is in the water; A diver using Surface Supply may rely on surface personnel to keep the diver's depth, time and diving profile Surface supplied air diving must not be conducted at depths deeper than 190 fsw (57.9 m). The UM DCB is responsible for developing additional operational protocols Manning Requirements The minimum number of personnel comprising a surface supplied dive team is three. They consist of: a Designated Person -In-Charge (DPIC), a Diver, and a Tender. Additional dive team members are required when a diving operation or dive site is considered complex, or when the task loading of a dive team member is deemed excessive. It is the UM DCB's responsibility to define when the surface supplied dive team must be expanded beyond the minimum manning requirements. Equipment The diver will wear a positive buckling device on the safety harness to which the umbilical hose will be secured . The attachment must be of sufficient strength to pr event any strain on the helmet/full face mask hose connections and equipment must be configured to allow retrieval of the diver by the surface tender without risk of interrupting air supply to the diver. Each diver must be equipped with a diver -carried ind ependent reserve breathing gas supply containing sufficient volume to complete the ascent to the surface, including all required decompression and safety stops. Masks and Helmets Surface supplied and mixed gas masks and helmets must have: A non- return valv e at the attachment point between the mask/helmet and hose which must close readily and positively; and An exhaust valve Surface -supplied masks and helmets must have a minimum ventilation rate capability of 4.5 actual cubic feet per minute (acfm) at any depth at which they are operated or the capability of maintaining the diver's inspired carbon dioxide partial pressure below 0.02 atmospheres absolute (ATA) when the diver is producing carbon dioxide at the rate of 1.6 standard liters per minute Helmets or masks connected directly to the dry suit or other buoyancy -changing equipment must be equipped with an exhaust valve Air supplied to the diver must meet the air quality standards outlined in section 3.60 Surface Supplied in Aquariums In an aquarium habitat where the maximum depth is known, a pneumofathometer is not required. The maximum obtainable depth of the aquarium may be used as the diving depth One tender may line -tend multiple divers, provided the tender is monitoring only one air source, there is mutual assistance between divers, there are no overhead obstructions or entanglements, or other restrictions as defined by the DCB. The DCB is responsible for developing additional operational protocols for surface supplied diving specific to the aquarium environment. 7.30 Hookah Hookah Definition Hookah is an open circuit diving mode comprised of a remote gas supply, a long hose, and a standard scuba second stage or full face mask. Hookah is generally used in shallow water (30 fsw or less), though the configuration has been used to supply breathing gas from a diving bell, habitat, or submersible/submarine. Equipment Requirements The air supply hose must be rated for a minimum operating pressure of 130psi. Air supplied to the hookah diver must meet the air quality standards outlined in section 3.60 Hookah supply systems must be capable of supplying all divers breathing from the system with sufficient gas for comfortable breathing for the planned depth and wo rkload . Hookah system second stage shall be capable of being attached to the diver in a way to avoid pulling stress on the second stage mouthpiece and affords easy release if the diver must jettison the regulator and hose . An independent reserve breathing gas supply must be carried by each hookah diver: When the diver does not have direct access to the surface or At depths or distance from alternate breathing gas source determined by the DCB . Operational Requirements Hookah diving must not be conducted beyond depths or distance from an alternate breathing gas source as determined by the DCB . A diver's independent reserve breathing gas supply, if worn, must contain sufficient volume to allow the diver(s) to exit to the surface or alternate breathing gas source Hookah divers not supported by diving bell, or underwater habitat must not be exposed to dives that require staged decompression. The UM DCB is responsible for developing additional operational prot ocols . Hookah Diving in Aquariums In an aquarium habitat where the maximum depth is known and planned for , a depth gauge is not required. The maximum obtainable depth of the aquarium may be used as the maximum diving depth. A hookah configured diver may operate without an in- water buddy in an aquarium provided the diver is tended from the surface; has visual, line pull, or voice communication with the tender; the diver carries an independent reserve breathing gas source containing sufficient volume to allow the diver to exit to the surface or alternate breathing gas source ; and under other operational conditions as determined by the DCB. The DCB is responsible for developing additional operational protocols for hookah diving specific to the aquarium environment. SECTION 8.00 STAGED DECOMPRESSION DIVING Decompression diving is defined as any diving during which the diver cannot perform a direct return to the surface without performing a mandatory decompression stop to allow the release of inert gas f rom the diver's body.

Mission specific workup dives are recommended prior to any mission involving mixed gas diving . 49 SECTION 10.00 SPECIALIZED DIVING ENVIRONMENTS Certain types of diving, some of which are listed below, require equipment or procedures that require environment -specific training . Supplementary guidelines for these environments are in development by AAUS . UM must have guidelines established by the Diving Control Board. Divers must comply with all scuba diving procedures in this manual unless specified otherwise . Diving in environments not included in this manual also require approval from the UM DCB. 10.10 Blue Water Diving Blue water divin g is defined as diving in open water where the bottom is generally greater than 200 feet deep . It requires special training and the use of multiple -tethered diving techniques . Specific guidelines that should be followed are outlined in \"Blue Water Diving Guidelines\" (California Sea Grant Publ. No. T -CSGCP -014). 10.20 Ice and Polar Diving Divers planning to dive under ice or in polar conditions should use the following: \" PESH - POL_2000.08 Standards for the Conduct of Scientific Diving\", National Science Foundation, Division of Polar Programs, 2015. 10.30 Overhead Environments For any diving conducted where there is no direct unrestricted access to the surface, refer to Section 12.00 . 10.40 Saturation Diving If conducting saturation diving operations, divers must comply with the scientific diving community saturation diving guidelines . 10.50 Aquarium Diving (See Section 4.30 ) An aquarium is a n artificial, confined body of water, which is operated by or under the control of an institution and is used for the purposes of specimen exhibit, education, husbandry, or research. It is recognized that within scientific aquarium diving there are environments and equipment that fall outside the scope of those addressed in this manual . In those c ircumstances it is the responsibility of the DCB to establish the requirements and protocol under which diving will be safely conducted. 10.60 Night Diving Night diving is defined as any diving that takes place between sunset and sunrise. Divers may be authorized to dive at night through the DSO. To be authorized, a UM diver must attend a night dive lecture and complete one night checkout dive with the DSO demonstrating understanding of night diving procedures and techniques, and use of night diving specific equipment. 10.70 Altitude Diving Altitude diving is considered any dive that takes place at an elevation of 1 ,000ft or more above sea level. Divers interested in conducting dives at altitude must at minimum attend a lecture by the DSO covering theoretical and practical considerations for altitude diving. No altitude checkout dive is required. 50 SECTION 11.00 R EBREATHERS This section defines specific considerations regarding the following issues for the use of rebreathers: Training and/or experience verification requirements for authorization Equipment requirements Operational requirements and additional safety protocols to be used Application of this standard is in addition to pertinent requirements of all other sections of this manual . For rebreather dives that also involve staged decompression and/or mixed gas diving, all requirements for each of the relevant diving modes must be met . The UM D CB reserves the authority to review each application of all specialized diving modes, and include any further requirements deemed necessary beyond those listed here on a case -by-case basis . No diver shall conduct planned operations using rebreathers without prior review and approval of the DCB. In all cases, trainers must be qualified for the type of instruction to be provided. Training must be conducted by agencies or instructors approved by DSO and DCB. 11.10 Definition 1) Rebreathers are defined as any device that recycles some or all of the exhaled gas in t he breathing loop and r eturns it to the dive r. Rebreathers maintain levels of ox ygen and ca rbon dioxide th at support life by metered inje ction of oxygen and chemical removal of ca rbon diox ide. These characteristics fund amentally distinguish r ebreathers from ope n- circuit life support systems, i n that the brea thing gas composi tion is d ynamic rather than fi xed. 2) There are three classes of rebreathers: a) Oxygen Rebreathers: Oxygen rebreathers recycle breathing gas, consist ing of p ure o xygen, replenishi ng the oxygen metaboli zed by the dive r. Oxygen rebreathers are generally the l east complic ated d esign but a re limited in de pth of use due to the p hysiological limits asso ciated of exhaled b reathing gas, venting a portion into t he water and replenishi ng it with a c onstant or variable amount of a single oxygen-enriched gas mixture. Gas addition and ve nting is balanced against diver metabolism to maintain s afe oxygen lev els. c) Closed -Circuit Rebreathers: Closed -circuit mixed gas rebreathers (CCR) r ecycle all of the g as. Ele ctronically controll ed CCRs ( eCCR) re place metabolized oxygen via a n electroni cally controlled valve, governed by oxygen sensors . Manually controll ed CCR (mCCR) rely on m echanical oxygen addition a nd diver monitoring to control ox ygen partial pressure (ppO 2). Depending on the de sign, man ual oxygen addition ma y be available on eCCR uni ts as a diver override, in c ase of electronic s ystem f ailure. Systems are equipp ed with t wo c ylinders; one with oxygen, the oth er with a diluent gas sou rce used to make up gas volume w ith depth increase and to di lute oxygen levels. CCR s ystems ope rate to maintain a constant ppO2 during the dive, re gardless of d epth. 11.20 Prerequisites for use of Any Rebreather 1) Active scientific dive r status, with depth authorization suf ficient for the t ype, mak e, and model of rebreather, and planne d application. 2) Compl etion of a minimum of 50 ope n-water dives on ope n circuit SCUBA. The DCB m ay require increased dive experience depending upon the intende d use of the re breather s ystem for 51 scientific diving. 3) For SCR or CCR, a minimum 60ft depth authorization is g enerally recommended. If the sole expected a pplication for use of rebreathe rs is shallower than 30ft , a 30ft UM science diver may be allowed with t he approva l of the D CB. 4) Nitrox training. Training in use of nitrox mixtures containing 25% to 40 % oxygen is r equired. Training in use of mi xtures containing 40% to 100% ox ygen may be required, as needed for the pl anned application and rebreather system. 11.30 Training 1) Divers entering the program with prior rebreather training and experience must at minimum show a proof of training and at least 12 open water dives totaling a minimum of 720 minutes underwater regardless of rebreather platform. 2) Divers entering the program with prior rebreather training and experience must also pass a checkout dive with the DSO demonstrating proficienc y with the rebreather model they wish to be authorized to use. 3) Specific training requirements for use of each rebreather mod el must be defined by DCB on a case-by-case basis. Training must include factory-recommended requirements, but m ay exceed this to pr epare for the t ype of mission i ntende d (e.g., staged decompr ession or he liox/trimix CCR d iving). (See training section for details.) 4) Successful c ompl etion of training does not in itself authori ze the dive r to use r ebreathers. The diver must demons trate to the D CB or its desi gnee that th e diver possess es the p roper attitude, judgment, and dis cipline to s afely conduc t rebreather diving in t he context of planne d operations. 5) Supervised training dive guidelines are outlined in Section 11.60 .

These calculations must ta ke into considerat ion mixed mode op erations where an open circuit diver could require assistance i n an out of gas si tuation. 8) Use and reuse of CO2 scrubber media should be per manufacturer recommendations and as defin ed by the DCB. 9) Planned oxygen parti al pressure in the breathing gas must not exceed 1.4 a tmospheres at depths greater than 30 feet, or 1.6 at depths less than 30 feet . 10) Both CNS and Oxygen Tolerance Units (OTUs) should be tracked for each diver. Exposure limits should be established by the DCB . 11) Divers must use a rebreather checklist for the assembly and functional testing of equipment prior to diving (divers may use the checklist in Appendix 4 ). Functional testing including a pre -breathe for at least 3 minutes is required prior to every dive. 53 12) All rebreathers must be disinfected at appropriate time intervals using a multi- spectrum disinfectant such as HBQuat. 13) All rebreather divers must perform a pre -breathe of at least 3 minutes prior to subme rsion. 14) Mixed mode diving is when two or more divers are using different diving modes or technologies, for example a rebreather diver diving with an open circuit diver. Mixed mode diving may be permitted at UM under some circumstances as approved by the DSO . When such an occurrence takes place, each diver must communicate to the team information regarding the technology or technique he/she is using. Information communicated must include operation of technology, safety considerations, emergency procedures, et c. Dive rs must be cross-briefed on basic system operat ions for es tablishing pos itive buoy ancy, closing rebreather diver's brea thing l oop, a nd procedur es for gas sharing. 15) Dives performed using rebreathers will follow the same depth authorization guidelines as found in Section 4.40 . 16) In order to maintain authorization as a UM scientific rebreather diver, divers must follow all the minimum procedures set forth in Section 4.50 , which includes a minimum 12 rebreather dives per year, minimum cumulative rebreather dive time of 12 hours, and at least one rebreather dive during every 6 -month period. T o count, dives should be no less than 30 min in dur ation. A required element of maintaining proficiency is the perio dic performance and reevaluat ion of skills related to in-water problem recognition and emer gency procedures. At minimum, demonstrated skills included in the required training elements for the level of rebreather operation must be performed and reevaluated. 17) If a diver is not a current authorized UM rebreather diver, the diver may be required to participate in pre -operation workup dives . These dives should include the review and practice of emerg ency r ecognition and response skills, and management of task l oading are required for operations defined by the DCB as beyond the scope of normal operating con ditions. 11.60 Rebreather Training Section Entry Level Rebreather Trainin g 1.

For cavern or cave dives that also involve staged decompression, rebreathers, and/or mixed gas diving, all requirements for each of the relevant diving techniques, modes, or gases must be met . No diver must conduct planned operations in caverns, caves, or other overhead environments without prior review and approval of the DCB or designee. The diver must demonstrate that he/she possesses the proper attitude, judgment, and discipline to safety conduct cave and cavern diving in the context of planned operations. If a conflict exists between this section and other sections in this manual , the information set forth in this section only takes precedence when the scientific diving being conducted takes place wholly or partly within an underwate r cave or cavern environment. 12.10 Definition A dive team must be considered to be cave or cavern diving if at any time during the dive they find themselves in a position where they cannot complete a direct, unobstructed ascent to the surface because of rock formations. In addition to blocking direct access to surfacing, underwater caves have additional environmental hazards including but not limited to: The absence of natural light. Current or flow that vary in strength and direction . Of particular note is a condition known as siphoning . Siphoning caves have flow or current directed into the cave . This can cause poor visibility as a result of mud and silt being drawn into the cave entrance. The presences of silt, sand, mud, clay, etc. that can cause visibility to be reduced to nothing in a very short time. Restrictions - Any passage through which two divers cannot easily pass side by side . Cave- Ins - Cave- Ins are a normal part of cave evolution; however experiencing a cave- in during diving operations is extremely unlikely. 61 12.20 Prerequisites Prerequisites Cavern: OC or Rebreather Cave Rebreather Cave Active scientific diver status, with depth qu alification suf ficient for proposed training location(s) X X X Comp letion of a minimum of 50 open water dives.

(Candidate Signature) (Date) 75 STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING (cont.) Name: Throughout all diving, dive training, and other operations as part of the UM scientific diving program... 1. Skin, scuba, and surface -supplied diving are physical activities involving heavy exertion. A diver must be in good general health, free from cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and have good exercise tolerance. Even momentary loss of consciousness underwater may be fatal. 2. While swimming or using skin, scuba, or surface -supplied diving equipment, the body is subject to a variety of influences that may become potentially hazardous . Some of these hazards include drowning, ruptured eardrums or sinuses, air/gas embolism, decompression sickness, and a variety of other barotrauma (pressure -related injuries). 3. There are organisms in the water that may bite, sting, claw, or inject substances in the body. 4. There are other water related problems that include reduced visibility, rough water, strong currents, and cold temperature. 5. When diving from a boat , a person may be subjected to bodily injury from carelessness due to activity, or related to equipment handling, or just from being present on a boat at sea. 6. The individual diver must realize that he/she is ultimately responsible for his/her own safety . It is clearly the diver's responsibility to refuse to dive if, in his/her judgment, conditions are unsafe. 7. The diver agrees to abide by all safety guidelines and policies put in place by the University of Miami diving safety program and D iving Safety M anual . 8. Due to the physical nature of diving, dive training, and related activities, physical contact is common. Instructors may need to make physical contact in order to correct diving technique or otherwise provide instruction. By signing below, the signatory understands that at times, for proper instruction and safety, physical contact is required and necessary. 9. Divers grant the University of Miami permission to use their likeness in a photograph, video, or other media in any and all of i ts publications, including web -based publications, pamphlets, brochures, presentations, etc. without payment or other consideration. Statement : I am in good physical and mental health and I am fit to dive . I hereby voluntarily exempt and release Eliseo \" Rick\" Riera- Gomez, Albert \"Robbie\" Christian, and the University of Miami, its Trustees, officers, and employees from liability for personal injury, property damage, or death arising from diving instruction, diving activities , or any activities incidental to diving operations for the duration of my association with the University of Miami. (Candidate Signature) (Date) 76 UM DIVER PROOF OF INSURANCE FORM As of September 1986 all UM/RSMAS divers are required to have some type of medical insurance to cover their expenses in the event of a scuba diving accident requiring Recompression/Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, (recompression chamber treatment). If you are diving as an employee, Worker's Compensati on can be the mode of coverage. However, if you are diving in a non -employment situation such as students, some other insurance coverage is necessary. It is recommended that you check with your insurance provider to see if you are covered for hyperbaric ox ygen therapy for scuba diving accidents. Not all insurance plans cover hyperbaric treatment for diving accidents. If you have no policy meeting this requirement you can purchase one from the Diver's Alert Network. Even if you do have medical insurance covering hyperbaric treatment for diving accidents, it is strongly recommended y ou purchase DAN insurance. When selecting a coverage choose the \"Master Plan\" or higher . You can contact DAN on the web at www.DiversAlertNetwork.org See the Diving Safety Officer for details of this policy and application forms. Complete the following and return to the Diving Safety Office at RSMAS.

DEFINITION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND EXPLANATION BAST is an acronym that stands for Buoyancy, Awareness, Stability, and Trim. These are the fundamental elements required of a scientific diver at the University of Miami. These elements are used during the evaluation process to evaluate a diver's readiness for scientific diving as a UM diver . Scientific divers diving under the auspices of UM are required to demonstrate each element to a satisfactory level. Each BAST element is scored on a 1 -5 scale and a total score is calculated by adding each of the four elements. A diver must earn a score of at least 12 points out of a maximum of 20 in order to pass . The diver does not pass the evaluation if any of his/her BAST scores receives a score of 1. If a diver receives a score of 1 on a ny element, the dive will be terminated. If a diver does not pass the BAST evaluation (<12 points total), corrective recommendations will be provided which shall include another BAST evaluation at a later date. BAST evaluation is scored over the duration of the entire dive. Although the UM DSO has developed this quantitative system for standardizing diver performance , this evaluation is subjective. The overall BAST evaluation will follow the scoring rubric below (half points may be awarded). 5: a skill performed at a demonstration quality 4: a skill performed well but with some minor errors or omissions 3: a skill performed satisfactorily 2: a skill performed with considerable errors or omissions 1: a skill performed in an unsafe manner Below is a description on how each element is evaluated during a checkout dive or other eval uation and what is considered a satisfactory performance level : Buoyancy - the diver must maintain neutral buoyancy within a target depth of +/ - 3 feet at all times during the dive. To receive a 5, a diver must remain within +/ -1ft of a target depth, with the majority of time spent at the target depth . A 3 will be awarded for a diver who remains within +/ - 3ft of a target depth, with the majority of time spent at the target depth . A 1 will be given to a diver who struggles with buoyancy, ascends or descends unintentionally, etc. Awareness - the diver must demonstrate awareness of his/her own equipment, team, surroundings, environment, etc. above and below the surface. A 5 will be awarded to a diver who demonstrates exceptional awareness of themselves, equipment, team, etc. A 1 will be given to a diver who fails to appropriately communicate with the team, loses contact with the team, demonstrates poor control of equipment, etc. Stability - the diver must remain in place without forward motion or the use of his/her hands. The diver must also demonstrate a reasonable level of comfort throughout the dive commensurate to the level of his/her authorization. To receive a 5, a diver must be able to hover in one position with no use of hands and no forward motion. A 3 will be a warded to a diver who uses minimal hand movement and minimal forward motion. A 1 will be given to a diver who relies on hands and forward motion for stability. Trim - the diver must remain horizontal (flat from shoulders to knees) throughout all parts of the dive. A 5 will be awarded to a diver who remains within 5\u00ba of horizontal throughout the entire dive. A 3 will be awarded to a diver who remains w ithin 10\u00ba of horizontal. A 1 will be given to a diver who is unable to achieve and maintain a trim of 45\u00ba or less. 81 SAMPLE LETTER OF RECIPROCITY TEMPLATE [Organization's Letterhead] [DATE] [Recipient] [Recipient Organization Name] This letter is to certify [Name of Diver] is a current ly authorized Scientific SCUBA Diver with the [Home Organization] Scientific Diving Program.

Air sharing - Sharing of an air supply between divers. All Gas - A gas management strategy that allows dive rs to use all of their usable gas (see Usable Gas) during the dive. Alternate Gas Supply - Fully redundant system capable of providing a gas source to the diver should their primary gas supply fail. See Independent Reserve Breathing Gas. Arterial Gas Embolism (AGE) - A medical emergency that oc curs when bubbles enter the bloodstream through damaged lung tissue obstruct ing the blood flow to an area of the brain, heart, or spinal cord. Atmospheres Absolute (ATA) - , Total pressure exerted on an object, by a gas or mixture of gases, at a specific depth or elevation, including normal atmospheric pressure. Auspices - The OM provides endorsement, protec tion, and support of the scientific diving program and scientific divers following the standards of the OM. Authorization - An endorsement by an AAUS OM that a diver has met program requirements and is current, allowing the diver to dive under the auspices of the OM. If a diver's authorization has lapsed or is not complete or current for any reason, the diver is not permitted to dive under UM auspices.

Authorized Diver - A diver who has met and is current with all of the authorization requirements of an AAUS OM. See Authorization. Awareness - The ability to directly know and perceive or be cognizant of events , equipment, gas pressure, surroundings, team, etc . BAST - The acronym to describe the evaluation of a diver's Buoyancy, Awareness, Stability, and Tr im. Bottom Time - The time of a dive measured from the moment the diver submerges until the diver reaches the surface. Dives separated by a surface interval of less than 10 minutes will be counted as one dive and the time spent at the surface will not be i ncluded in the calculation of bottom time. Breath -hold Diving - A diving mode in which the diver uses no self -contained or surface -supplied air or oxygen supply. Bubble Check - Visual examination by the dive team of their diving systems, looking for O -ring leaks or other air leaks conducted in the water prior to entering a cave.

See also: Neutral Buoyancy. Buoyant Ascent - An ascent made using some form of positive buoyancy. Cave Dive - A dive, which takes place partially or wholly underground, in which one or mor e of the environmental parameters defining a cavern dive are exceeded. If it is an overhead environment deeper 85 than 70ft or linear penetration more than 130ft from the entry point at the surface, it is considered a cave. Cavern Dive - A dive which takes place partially or wholly underground, in which natural sunlight is continuously visible from the entrance. Caverns are shallower than 70ft and a cavern dive may not exceed 130ft of linear penetration from the entry point at the surface. Certified Diver - A diver who holds a recognized valid certification from an AAUS OM or internationally recognized certifying agency. A diver with a valid \"scientific diver certification\" is not necessarily an active authorized science diver. (Scientific Diver) Certification - A diver who has completed the training outlined in Section 4 .0 at an AAUS member organization. Throughout this manual a certification, unless explicitly noted that it is for an internationally recognized training agency, simply means that a diver has completed i nitial science diver training.

Decompression Sickness (DCS) - A condition with a variety of symptoms, which may result from gas, and bubbles in the tissues of divers after pressure reduction. Decompression Stop - Th e designated depth and time at which a diver must stop and wait during an ascent from a decompressi on dive . The depth and time are specified by the decompression table, computer, or software in use. Deep Stops - An ascent strategy where divers make a one minute stop beginning at half of the maximum depth reached on the dive and then ascend ing by stopping every 10 feet for one minute at each 10ft increment all the way to the surface. Designated Person- In-Charge - Surface Supplied diving mode manning requirement. An individual designated by the DCB or designee with the experience or training necessary to direct, and oversee in the surface supplied diving operation being conducted.Dive - A descent into the wat er, an underwater diving activity utilizing compressed gas, an ascent, and return to the surface. Dive Computer - A microprocessor based device that computes a diver's theoretical decompression status, in real time, by using pressure (depth) and time as input to a decompression model, or set of decompression tables, programmed into the device. Dive Location - A surface or vessel from which a diving operation is conducted. Dive Site - Physical location of a diver during a dive. Dive Table - A profile o r set of profiles of depth -time relationships for ascent rates and breathing mixtures to be followed after a specific depth -time exposure or exposures. Diver - A person who stays underwater for periods of time by having compressed gas supplied from t he 86 surface or by carrying a supply of compressed gas . Diver -In-Training (Scientific Diver Candidate) - An individual gaining experience and training in additional diving activities under the supervision of a dive team member experienced in those activities . Diver Propulsion Vehicle (DPV, Scooter) - DPVs are electronically powered device used to transport divers through the water. They are primarily used to benefit divers on large dive sites or sites with strong currents as an alternative to a diver swimming /finning. Diving Control Board (D CB) - Group of individuals who act as the official representative of the membership organization in matters concerning the scientific diving program ( see Diving Control Board under Section 1.0 ). Diving Mode - A type of diving required specific equipment, procedures, and techniques, for example, snorkel, scuba, surface -supplied air, or mixed gas. Diving Safety Officer (DSO) - Individual responsible for the safe conduct of the scientific diving program of the membership organization ( see Diving Saf ety Officer under Section 1.20 ). DPIC - See Designated Perso n-In-Charge. DPV - See Diver Propulsion Vehicle EAD - Equivalent Air Depth (see below). Emergency Care Training (ECT) - See Section 4.50 . Emergency Swimming Ascent - An ascent made under emergency conditions where the diver may exceed the normal ascent rate. Enriched Air (EANx) - A name for a breathing mixture of air and oxygen when the percent of oxygen exceeds 21% . This term is considered synonymous with the term \"nitrox\" ( Section 6.00 ). Equivalent Air Depth (EAD) - Depth at which air will have the same nitrogen partial pressure as the nitrox mixture being used. This number, expressed in units of feet seawater or saltwater, will always be less than the actual depth for any enriched air mixture. Flooded Mine Diving - Diving in the flooded portions of a man- made mine . Necessitates use of techniques detailed for cave diving. fO 2 - Fraction of oxygen in a gas mixture, expressed as either a decimal or percentage, by volume. FSW - Feet of seawater. Functionality Test (Functionality Check/Inspection) - The evaluation of a piece of equipment or part to verify and demonstrate that it is in proper working order. Gas Management - Gas planning rule which is used in cave diving environments in which the diver reserves a portion of their available breathing gas for anticipated emergencies ( see Rule of T hirds, Sixths). Gas Matching - The technique of calculating breathing gas reserves and turn pressures for divers using different volume cylinders. Divers outfitted with the same volume cylinders may employ the Rule of Thirds for gas management purposes. D ivers outfitted with different volume cylinders will not observe the same gauge readings when their cylinders contain the same gas volume, therefore the Rule of Thirds will not guarantee adequate reserve if both divers must breathe from a single gas volume at a Rule of Thirds turn pressure. Gas Matching is based on individual consumption rates in volume consumed per minute. It allows divers to calculate turn pressures based on combined consumption rates and to convert the required reserve to a gauge based t urn pressure specific to each diver's cylinder configuration. 87 GUEEDGE - Acronym for pre -dive briefing sequence.

This class is a progression of steps in the classroom and in the pool so attendance is imperative. Students are requested to notify the DSO for any anticipated absences. 10. Students are strongly encouraged to come to the DSO throughout the semester to discuss and review course performance (includes academic and video review). 11. Students are responsible for any and all UM equipment they borrow or are assigned. This includes the equipment care, maintenance, and return at the end of usage. If a piece of equipment is damaged, lost, stolen, or in any way returned in a condition other than the condition received from the DSO, students will be financially responsible for its repair or replacement. Equipment is expect ed to be returned within a week of your last planned dive unless other arrangements have been made with the DSO. a. Students are responsible for notifying the DSO of any equipment maintenance issues and bringing the equipment in need of repair to the DSO as s oon as possible for repair or replacement. b. Students are not permitted to use DSO issued gear during the semester for proficiency dives until they are fully authorized (final grades submitted). c. Using DSO issued gear for recreational diving is not permitted. 12. Students may dive with a project after completing a minimum of 10 dives with the DSO. The student will be considered a Diver in Training (DIT) until all authorization and course requirements are satisfactorily met . For more information about diving author ization s, refer to Section 4.30 of the UM Diving Safety Manual (DSM). a. Students are permitted to use DSO issued gear for internships, project dives, etc. prior to final grade submission (pending approval of a UM dive plan). 13. During the semester, the DSO will continuously monitor the weather and diving conditions and will notify students ASAP of changes in the semester syllabus. The decision to dive or cancel the dive will sometimes have to be made the day of the dive. a. When diving offshore and the forecasted winds are greater than 15kts and/or seas greater than 2- 4 ft wave height, dives will be cancelled. 93 b. Dives will be cancelled when a small craft caution or greater is issued by NOAA. c. Other environmental conditions or hazards may also be cause for cancellation of a dive(s). 14. Students are responsible for logging all open water dives on the dive logging website in a timely manner. 15. If a student is not confident in his/her health, fitness, or readiness to dive, he/she is responsible for withdrawing from diving activities. 16. Students may dive deeper than their authorization depth or be introduced to specialized equipment and techniques with the DSO during this course to achieve training goals. These training/experience dives may not result in depth or specialized dive technology/technique authorization. 17. Due to the physical nature of dive training and related activities, physical contact is common . Instructors may need to make physical contact in order to correct diving techni que or otherwise provide instruction. By registering for this course, the student understands that at times, for proper instruction and safety, physical contact is required and necessary. 18. The D CB/DSO expressly reserve the right to prohibit any student from taking the class. 19. During the semester, a student may be asked to not participate in in -water activities at any time due to unsafe behavior above or below water, lack of participation, absences, or any other conduct/action deemed inappropriate by the DCB/ DSO. Academics and Authorization Academic Grades Academic grade will be made up of 2 grades: 1. Written Exams grade (50%) - There will be 2 written exams and some quizzes. The exam and quiz grades will be combined to make up the final written grade. a. Quiz gr ade (5%) Quizzes cover the Computer -Based Learning (CBL) modules from the first part of the semester. A missed quiz earns a 0. All quizzes combined make up 5% of the overall grade. b. Mid-term diving exam (25%) The midterm exam will be on the SCUBA topics tha t we cover during the first half of the course. To qualify for UM/RSMAS diving authorization, a diver candidate must receive a minimum grade of 80% on each section of the mid- term diving exam. c. Final science techniques exam (20%) The final exam will cover t he topics discussed after the mid -term exam as well as the readings posted on Blackboard . The final exam is not a cumulative grade. The final written exam will be conducted underwater in the pool. Details will be discussed in class. 2. Scuba Skills grade (50%) - This part of the course grade is an evaluation of scuba skills students learn and practice throughout the semester. Students are evaluated on 20 skills with each skill graded on a 1 -5 scale (5 being the highest possible score) with half -point increments. DSOs score each diver and each skill individually and students receive the average of both instructors' scores. This grade is subjective an d based on diver safety, ability to perform skills, attentiveness, effort, and ability to follow directions. Students must receive a score of 80% or higher by all DSOs to be authorized as UM Scientific Divers. Below are the point values awarded for skill performance. a. 5: a skill performed at a demonstration quality b. 4: a skill performed well but with some minor errors or omissions c. 3: a skill performed satisfactorily 94 d. 2: a skill performed with considerable errors or omissions e. 1: a skill performed in an unsafe manner Students unable to complete the scuba skills portion of the course for any reason may receive an academic grade for their transcripts but will not receive authorization as a UM Scientific Diver until all the authorization requirements are met. This is not a recreational dive course, the goals are not to achieve certifications, so do not expect recreational certification cards for this course. UM Scientific Diver Authorization To be authorized as a UM Scientific Diver, ALL authorization requiremen ts have to be satisfactorily completed. Students may earn an academic grade without attaining UM science diver authorization. For more details refer to the UM Diving Safety Manual. Enrolling in and completing the course does not automatically guarantee UM science diver authorization. Authorization must be earned! During this course, there are two primary objectives students will be working to achieve: 1. Academic grade for transcripts 2. UM scientific diver authorization Situations not covered in this SOP wi ll be handled on a case -by-case basis in accordance with the UM Diving Safety Manual. 95 APPENDIX 7 EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN Introduction The information contained in this manual is a simplified system of identifying and stabilizing diving accident victims and facilitating entry into the hyperbaric trauma care system . Divers may ignore their own mild symptoms of Decompression Illness (DCI) in the early stages and by doing so they may develop more serious symptoms . Although primarily intended as a treatment guide for University diving operations in the field, this manual can also be used to insure that paramedics, physicians, Coast Guard and other assisting personnel understand and perform the specialized procedures for handling diving accident cases. A diving accident victim could be any person who has been breathing compressed gas underwater regardless of depth. It is essential that emergency procedures are pre -planned and that medical treatment is initiated as soon as possible . It is the responsibility of the University of Miami to develop procedures for diving emergencies including evacuation and medical treatment for each dive location. General Proc edures Depending on and according to the nature of the diving accident: 1. Make appropriate contact with victim or rescue as required. 2. Establish (A)irway (B)reathing (C)irculation or (C)irculation (A)irway (B)reathing as appropriate 3. Stabilize the victim. 4. Administer 100% oxygen, if appropriate (in cases of Decompression Illness, or Near Drowning). 5. Call local Emergency Medical System (EMS) for transport to nearest medical treatment facility. Explain the circumstances of the dive incident to the evacuation teams, medics and physicians . Do not assume that they understand why 100% oxygen may be required for the diving accident victim or that recompression treatment may be necessary. 6. Call DAN (919 -684-9111) for contact with diving physician and r ecompression chamber , etc. 6. Notify DSO or designee accord ing to the Emergency Action Plan of the OM . 7. Complete and submit the Unive rsity of Miami form found -accident -form - september -2016.pdf . 8. Complete and submit Incident Report Form (www.aaus.org) to the UM DCB and AAUS (Section 2 .70 Required Incident Reporting ). GENERAL POLICY Introduction 1. Development of exact procedures to cover all possible emergency situations can not be accomplished in this manual because of the immense number of variables involved (e.g., differences in diving location, personnel, available medical facilities, transportation, etc.). 2. This section is intended to serve as a planning guide for University divers to formulate specific procedures for their operations . Supervisory personnel, under direction of the Diving Safety Officer, must use judgment in selecting procedures which best suit the nature of their operation. 3. Detailed accident management and first aid techniques may be found in the NOAA Diving Manual, Red Cross manuals, DAN First Aid manual, and many other approved publications. 96 Preparedness 1. All supervisors and team members must be prepared to respond properly in the event of an accident . Prompt emergency procedures can reduce the residual effects on the victim and can possibly save a life. 2. Periodic retraining and routine practice are essential elements in emergency preparedness; emergency drills are encouraged. 3. The importance of prevention through operations planning, following safety regulati ons, and using common sense can not be ove remphasized. ON-SITE ACCIDENT MANAGEMENT Rescue/first aid 1. The persons nearest the victim (in scuba & usually the buddy), will initiate rescue/recovery procedures. 2. The rescuer will signal for assistance (voice, whistle, flare, etc.) 3. If the victim is not breathing, the rescuer should consider providing two initial rescue breaths. Rescuer will tow the victim to the appropriate extraction point . 4. Once on a suitable platform, resuscitation must be continued with a minimum of interruption and not be discontinued until the victim resumes breathing, is turned over to a higher authority, or is pronounced dead by a physician. 5. The Lead Diver, next senior diver, or ship's captain will take charge of the scene and delegate tasks to other responsible individuals . Other team members, if available on site will be dispatched by the Lead Diver to assist in the rescue efforts. 6. If a gas embolism or decompression sickness is suspected and the victim is breathing, immediately begin prescribed first aid (sup ine position, administer oxygen, fluids (water) if conscious and alert , treat for shock, and kee p under constant observation). Summoning Aid: Miami area 1. Divers in the Miami area should radio US Coast Guard on VHF channel 16 or local EMS by cellular phone (911) and indicate that you have a \"scuba diving emergency and need a recompression chamber\" . 2. Inform the USCG/EMS that you are evacuating the victim to the nearest accessible dock, where that dock is, and they should contact the South Florida Hyperbaric Medical Center 1 800 NO BENDS to activ ate the recompression chamber. 3. Monitor your VHF or keep your cellular phone on and stay in contact with the USCG/EMS for the duration of the emergency. 4. The USCG/EMS may direct you to take the victim somewhere besides t he place you indicated . Cooperate with them. 5. Attempt to contact the RSMAS Diving Safety Office via VHF or cellular phone. 6. If unable to contact USCG on VHF or cellular phone, use VHF marine operator on channel 24 or 25 to place a telephone call to South Florida Hyperbaric Medical Center 1 800 NO Bends or the Dade County Fire Rescue at 911. At Sea on Research Vessels: 1. Divers: a. Immediately advise ship's Master of the situation and request assistance as needed. b. Administer first aid to victim (oxygen, supine position, fluids (water) if conscious and alert, treat for shock, monitor vitals). c. Consult emergency plan for instructions. d. Keep ship's captain comprised of the situation as it progresses. e. Conduct neurological exam on patient, if possible, and record r esults on exam form . 97 2. Ship's Master: a. Contact the Divers Alert Network (DAN) and be specific about the accident: \"this is a scuba diving accident requiring a recompression chamber\" . DAN will provide nearest operati onal chamber info. and will help coordinate transportation. b. Stay in contact with divers and get neurological exam results from them on the patient. c. Give physician at DAN as accurate a description as possible about the condition of the patient. d. Make plans for possible evacuation of patient to chamber, whether it be helicopter evac or steaming to port. b. Obtain important information from the victim, i.e., passport, consent to treat form . 3. Persons/organizations to be notified: a. Victim's family (to be notified by UM authorities) b. DAN (for medical advice, evacuation procedures) c. UM/RSMAS authorities (Diving Safety Officer) d. Recompression chamber On-site Care of Diving Casualty 1. If an asymptomatic emergency is managed at the scene & hospitalization or professional medical attention are not required: a. Provide victim with emergency numbers for diving physician, l ocal medical facility, etc. b. Do not let the victim drive or be alone for the next six hours. c. In the event of a drownin g, the victim must be taken to a hospital as soon as possible for further evaluation by a medical professional. 2. Any person resuscitated at the dive site must be transported to a medical facility for follow up examination/treatment, preferably by a hyperbar ic physician. Additional On- Site Procedures While Awaiting Aid/Transport: 1. Recall all divers in the water, terminate all diving operations, secure equipment, be certain all dive team members are accounted for. 2. Non-involved dive team members shall stand by a nd not interfere with emergency efforts. 3. Diving operations shall not resume until the appropriate emergency equipment and personnel are back at the dive site. 4. Designate team members to control crowds or bystanders, keep non- essential personnel away from th e victim and first aid providers, instruct dive team members not to mingle with bystanders and not to discuss the accident with anyone (especially in a beach/shore operation), do not allow any dive team members to leave until dismissed by the Lead Diver or Diving Safety Officer . In fatal or serious accidents , authorization from local law enforcement officers will be required for dismissal of witnesses. EMERGENCY EVACUATION GUIDELINES General: The following medical evacuation information should be forwarded with the patient . If possible, take time to explain the following steps to the physician or paramedic . Do not assume they understand the reasons why procedures such as administration of oxygen to a diving casualty must be performed . Call the Dive rs Alert Network (919) 684 -9111 (you can also call South Florida Hyperbaric Medical Center 800 -662-3637 (800 NO BENDS)) for medical consultation if doubt exists that the physician/hospital possess the competence to handle a diving accident . 1. Maintain breath ing and heart functions, ensure an open airway . If CPR is being administered, there must be an absolute minimum of interruption during transfer. 2. Keep patient on oxygen and in supine position during transport . 3. Ensure paramedics/physician understand why the patient must be taken to a recompression chamber, and why #2 is important. 98 4. Do not stop giving oxygen to patient unless there is a need to reopen the airway, or patient show signs of oxygen convulsions. 5. Treat for shock (lay patient supine, elevate patient' s legs, keep patient comfortable). 6. Do not give any pain killing drugs. 7. Instruct flight crews to fly as low as possible (below 1000 ft. is preferred). 8. If possible, the dive buddy should also be transported with the victim because he/she may also need recompression and can give valuable information about the dive profile. 9. A complete history of all events leading to the accident should be forwarded with the patient. 10. Victim's dive gear should be properly tagged and sent with the victim or at least set asi de without tampering, especially if the accident was fatal. Evacuation by Air: Each helicopter evacuation presents unique problems . Knowing what to expect and the procedures to follow, however, can save time, effort, and perhaps a life. 1. Request a helicopter with a medic crew and oxygen . 2. Try to establish communications with the helicopter. 3. If possible, maintain a speed of 10- 15 knots into wind about 20 degrees off the port bow . 4. Put all antennas down, if possible, without losing communications. 5. Secure all loose objects on or around the decks because of the strong winds generated by the helicopter. 6. Make sure the patient is ready in advance of the transfer. 7. Signal the pilot when all is ready, using hand signals in daylight and flashlight s ignals at night. 8. Do not secure the trail line, basket, or any cable from the aircraft to the boat . 9. Always let the lifting device (stretcher) touch the boat before handling it, to prevent electric shock. 10. Place a lifejacket on patient and tie them in basket face up. 11. Attach personal information such as name, address, age, next of kin, what happened, medication administered, drug allergies. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS Responsibility: Serious accidents and fatalities often lead to legal actions . Each d iver has a responsibility as a representative of the University, to act in a responsible manner, both for the benefit of the University and him/herself. Guidelines for serious accidents: 1. Contact local law enforcement authorities 2. Be polite but firm r egarding interviews and questions . If approached, simply indicate that information will be made available through the University's Diving Safety Office . Remember that any statement made under stress may later cause considerable problems for members of the dive team including yourself, University, and victim. 3. The Lead Diver should serve as spokesman for the group if necessary . 4. Give only factual information to authorities . Avoid expressing opinions or conclusions under stress. 5. Have each dive team member prepare a detailed written statement of the facts . Do it as soon as possible the day of the accident . 6. The Lead Diver should complete the Accident Report form for the Diving Control Board as soon as possible . 99 EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PHONE NUMBERS FOR THE MIAMI AREA RECOMPRESSION CHAMBERS: At Mercy Hospital (Miami, F L) 1-800-NO BENDS Mercy Hospital Hyperbaric Dept. 305.854.0300 305.854.2466 Mercy Hospital Emergency Room 305.854.4400 Dade County Fire Rescue 911 Diver's Alert Network (DAN) Emergency 1.919.684.9111 Diver's Alert Network (DAN) -Emergency 1.919.684.2948 HOSPITALS: Mercy Hyperbarics Dept. 305.854.0300 UM/Jackson Memorial Hospital Emergency Room 305.585- 1111 AMBULANCE : Dade County Fire Rescue 911 AIR TRANSPORTATION: US Coast Guard, District Operations Off., Miami, F L 305.536.5611 VHF Radio channel 16 USCG Emergency Phone, Miami, F L 305.535.4313 POLICE : General, Miami 911 Key Biscayne police (non- emergency) 305.365.3013 Key Biscayne police (24 hrs.) 305.585.6666 UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI: RSMAS Diving Safety Office 305.421.4107 Rick Riera- Gomez 305.338.1445 Marine Dept. 305.421.4880 100 CARE FOR THE INJURED DIVER Decompression Illness (DCI) which includes a rterial gas embolism (AGE) and decompression sickness (DCS), are the two most frequent serious scuba -related accidents . AGE, also known as air embolism, occurs when bubbles entering the bloodstream through damaged lung tissue obstruct the blood flow to an area of the brain, heart, or sp inal cord . DCS , also known as the \"bends\", is the syndrome of joint pains (the bends), paralysis, numbness, and other symptoms resulting from insufficient decompression or surfacing too rapidly from a dive . If not treated, both conditions can be fatal. A diving accident victim may be any person who has been breathing a compressed gas underwater regardless of depth or time . Gas embolism can occur in as little as four (4) feet of water if one ascends holding his/her breath. Even a well -trained diver may encou nter problems because of respiratory Asthma, broncholithiasis, congenital or acquired cysts, emphysema, fibrosis, tuberculosis, infection and obstructive lung diseases may result in air -trapping in the alveoli during ascent . The expansion of trapped air may be sufficient to rupture air spaces and escaping air may cause emphysema of the lungs, mediastinum or neck. More serious problems of pneumothorax or arterial gas embolism may also result. Decompression sickness can occur in any individual who violates the decompression tables either willingly or unintentionally when surfacing from depths greater than 30 feet . Cases of DCS have also been reported where divers were diving within the no- decompression limits. To insure a successful treatment, instructors, dive masters, paramedics, emergency room personnel, and physicians must be able to recognize the problem and begin the proper treatment while arranging entry into the hyperbaric trauma system. In any situation suggesting a diving accident, the primary question is \"Did the subject breathe compressed gas underwater?\" If the answer is \"yes\", or if the victim is unconscious then the subject must be regarded as a diving accident victim . The treatment procedure must be initiated immediately . This in cludes basic life support, administering oxygen, supine position, and immediate evacuation to the recompression chamber complex. LUNG OVEREXPANSION INJURIES Arterial Gas Embolism (AGE) As a diver surfaces without exhaling, air trapped in the lungs expands and may rupture lung tissue releasing gas bubbles into the circulatory system where they may be distributed to the body tissues . The ascending diver is normally in a vertical position and the bubbles tend to travel upward toward the brain, eventually reaching a small artery blocking circulation . The effects of halting circulation to the brain are critical and require immediate treatment. Symptoms of embolism may be present when the victim reaches the surface or within a few minutes afterwards. CAUSES: Hold ing breath during ascent while breathing compressed air Lung disease causing air trapping 101 Diving with cold, chest congestion Airway obstruction from foreign object in the mouth; gum, etc. SYMPTOMS: Unconsciousness within 5 minutes of surfacing from a di ve Dizziness, staggering Visual disturbances Paralysis Bloody froth from the mouth/nose Respiratory arrest Note : Symptoms usually appear within 15 minutes after surfacing. PREVENTION: Always breathe normally during ascent Get a periodical medical examination by a hyperbaric physician Do not dive with cold or chest congestion Do not chew gum, tobacco, etc. while diving TREATMENT: Supine position Administer 100% oxygen Administer fluids(water), to conscious, alert victim only . Do initial neurological exam Evacuate to recompression chamber/hospital ASAP DO NOT ATTEMPT IN -WATER TREATMENT Pneumothorax Air enters the chest cavity causing lungs to collapse. CAUSES: Same as Gas embolism SYMPTOMS: Shortness of breath Sharp pai n in c hest SIGNS: Rapid shallow breathing Blueness of skin, lips, fingernails Lungs sound different from one side to the other PREVENTION: Same as Gas embolism 102 TREATMENT: ABC's, give O2, treat for shock, Do NOT use recompression without a chest tube . Physician will insert chest tube to with draw air and re -inflate lung Mediastinal Emphysema Air released into tissues surrounding the heart. CAUSES: Same as Gas embolism SYMPTOMS: Faintness Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing PREVENTION: Same as Gas embolism TREATMENT: ABC's Observe for other problems Administer oxygen Treat for shock Seek medical advice from hyperbaric physician Subcutaneous Emphysema Air trapped under skin around neck. CAUSES: Same as AGE SYMPTOMS: Feeling of fullness around neck Change in voice Swelling in neck Crackling sound when skin is pressed PREVENTION: Same as AGE TREATMENT: Check ABC's Call the Diver's Alert Network Administer oxygen Treat for shock Seek medical advice from hyperbaric physician 103 Note : If any doubt about injury being more complicated than just Subcutaneous Emphysema, treat as Gas embolism. DECOMPRESSION SICKNE SS Decompression sickness (bends) is the result of inadequate decompression following a dive . While immediate recompr ession is not usually a matter of life or death as with air embolus, the quicker recompression is initiated, the better the rate and extent of recovery . The body tissues absorb gas in proportion to the surrounding pressure (depth) and as long as the diver remai ns at pressure (depth), the gas present s no problem . If the pressure is released too quickly (surfacing too rapidly or omitting required decompression), the inert gas comes out of solution and forms bubbles in the tissues and blood stream. Mild DCS (USN Classification Type I) Mild symptoms may respond to oxygen treatment at the scene . Fatigue (mild), skin rash, and weakness are considered a minor symptom and may require recompression. If the diver surfaces from a dive and behaves in an unusual manner, appears confused, or has fatigue, weakness or skin rash, he/she may have early symptoms of a diving accident. Immediately place the diver in a position of comfort and administer oxygen. Oxygen treatment often relieves the symptoms or prevents them from getting worse . The injured diver may deny signs and symptoms of having a problem and might refuse oxygen. Good judgment should prevail and the diver should receive treatment . If the symptoms appear relieved after an interval of oxygen treatment, do no t remove the oxygen immediately as the symptoms may recur . The victim should continue to receive 100% oxygen for as long as the supply will last. Severe DCS (USN Classification Type II) Severe symptoms consisting of joint pain, weakness or paralysis, stagg ering, respiratory difficulties or unconsciousness require immediate treatment and evacuation to the nearest appropriate medical facility . CPR will be required if the victim has no pulse or respiration. If a person at any time within 24 hours after a dive shows any severe symptoms, immediately provide the victim with oxygen and place in a position of comfort . Monitor pulse and respiration until evacuation to the recompression chamber has been accomplished. It is important to remember that because these sign s and symptoms can develop hours after diving, the patient may show up in a hospital emergency room or other medical facility in the community . For this reason, it is important for paramedics and physicians to recognize the symptoms and to understand this problem so that the proper procedure can be initiated. It is also extremely important that any person delivering a diving accident patient to a medical facility. CAUSES: Inadequate decompression caused by - Rapid ascent, exceeding 60 ft./minute 104 Omitted de compression stop Ignoring predisposing factors, i.e., obesity, dehydration, cold- arduous dives, flying too soon after diving, over -heating or overexertion after a dive. SYMPTOMS: Joint pain (Type I) Extreme fatigue (Type I) Skin rash (Type I) Paralysis, numbness (Type II) Unconsciousness (Type II) Dizziness, staggering (Type II) Other neurological deficiencies (Type II) Note : Symptoms usually occur within 6 hours after the dive, but can be delayed for up to 24 hours. PREVENTION: Do not dive if dehydrated, hungover, intoxicated, overly fatigued Conservative use of dive tables, including safety stops on ascents. If overweight be even more conservative in planning and conducting dives Avoid exertion and over -heating after a dive, (hot showers, pulling anchor) TREATMENT: Supine position/legs elevated Administer 100% oxygen Administer fluids(water), to conscious, alert victim only . Do initial neurological exam Evacuate to recompression chamber/hospital ASAP DO NOT ATTEMPT IN -WATER TREATMENT HYPERCAPNIA An excess of carbon dioxide is retained in the body. CAUSES: Over -exertion Skip breathing Hyperventilation; improper breathing pattern Loss of air supply SYMPTOMS: Labored or rapid breathing 105 Headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea Unconsciousness PREVENTION: Stop, rest, breathe normally, surface if breathing becomes labored Avoid causes listed above TREATMENT: Give oxygen ABC's, CPR, if required STINGING INJURIES CAUSES: Sponges, Corals, Jellyfish, Man- O-War, Fire Worm SYMPTOMS: Itching, Burning Redness and swelling, welts, (such as with poison ivy) PREVENTION: Avoid marine organisms with stinging potential TREATMENT: Use hot water or vinegar to deactivate nemomatcysts Remove tentacles carefully with forceps Wash the affected area with soap and fresh water and then treat symptoms To combat allergic reactions, use of diphenhydramine is encouraged For severe injuries the victim should seek medical advice BASIC STEPS FOR MANAGING DIVING ACCIDENTS 1. Stop what you are doing . Pause and think before acting . 2. Assess the scene for any hazards or dangers . If the scene is unsafe, try to make the scene safe. If a scene cannot be made safe, do not enter the scene - call 911 immediately and stay away. 3. Find any relevant resources . Depending on the circumstances, thi s could either be finding and collecting necessary resources or simply making a mental note of where relevant resources are. 4. Exposure prote ction - apply personal protective equipment such as gloves. 5. Check the victim for level of responsiveness using the ac ronym AVPU . a. A - Injured diver is aware and oriente d to him/herself, the time, and the location. b. V - Injured diver gives a response when presented with a verbal stimulus. c. P - Injured diver gives a response only when presented with a painful stimulus. d. U - Injured diver is completely unresponsive and shows no mental function. 6. Call EMS (911) . If the injured diver is not A on AVPU scale or if there is any question whether EMS may be needed, call 911. After calling 911, it may be prudent to also call the Diver 's Alert Network. 7. Care for the victim. Care for the victim comes in many forms depending on the situation but always prioritize the diver's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC's/CAB's). If the diver is not conscious, then the first step of care is to look, listen, and feel for breathing and a pulse . If a 106 pulse is present without breathing, rescue breaths are appropriate . If neither pulse nor breathing are present, follow the steps for CPR below : a. Position the injured diver on his/her back. b. Give 30 compressions about 2\" deep on the center of the sternum at a rate of 100- 120 compressions per minute. c. Open victim's airway with head -tilt, chin -lift method. d. Provide two breaths orally, with the MTV100, or with a BVM. e. Continue this pattern of 30 compressions to 2 br eaths for 2 minutes (about 5 sets of 30:2). f. Look, listen, and feel for signs of life every 2 minutes. g. Continue this process as long as possible. 8. For most diving accidents , provide the diver with the highest percentage of oxygen available for as long as it will last . The first choice of oxygen delivery equipment for any injured diver is the MTV100. If the MTV100 is not available, the first choice is the demand inhalator valve . For multiple injured divers, see the recommendations below: a. The diver with the most serious suspected injury should breathe from the MTV100. b. The diver with a less severe suspected injury should breathe from the demand inhalator valve if the diver is breathing hard enough to activate the valve. c. The diver with the least severe suspected injury should breathe from the nonrebreather mask set to a flow rate of 10- 15 liters per minute. d. A non- breathing diver should be given respirations via the MTV100 (first choice), bag valve mask, or oronasal resuscitation mask with supplemental oxygen set to a flow rate of 10-15 liters per minute. 9. Treat for shock by: a. Maintaining the diver's temperature . b. If possible, place the injured diver supine with legs elevated 10- 12\" (if head, neck, or back injury is not suspected) . If this is not p ossible, place diver in position of comfort. c. Provide oxygen. d. Do not administer fluids orally. 10. If the diver is responsive and alert and circumstances permit , conduct a neurological exam once every 15 minutes for the first hour and then every hour thereafter. 107 APPENDIX 8 AAUS STATISTICS COLLECTION CRITERIA AND DEFINITIONS COLLECTION CRITERIA: The \"Dive Time in Minutes\", The Number of Dives Logged\", and the \"Number of Divers Logging Dives \" will be collected for the following categories. Dive Classification Breathing Gas Diving Mode Decompression Planning and Calculation Method Depth Ranges Specialized Environments Incident Types Dive Time in Minutes is defined as the surface -to-surface time including any safety or required decompression stops. A Dive is defined as a descent underwater utiliz ing compressed gas and subsequent ascent/return to the surface with a minimum surface interval of 10 minutes. Dives will not be differentiated as op en water or confined water dives. But open water and confined water dives will be logged and submitted for AAUS statistics classified as either scientific or training/proficiency. A \"Diver Logging a Dive\" is defined as a person who is diving under the aus pices of your s cientific diving organization. Dives logged by divers from another AAUS Organization will be reported with the diver's home organization. Only a diver who has actually logged a dive during the reporting period is counted under this category. Incident(s) that occur during the collection cycle: Only incidents that occurred during, or resulting from, a dive where the diver is breathing a compr essed gas will be submitted to AAUS. DEFINITIONS: Dive Classification : Scientific Dives: Dives that meet the scientific diving exemption as defined in 29 CFR 1910.402. Diving tasks traditionally associated with a specific scientific discipline are considered a scientific dive. Construction and trouble -shooting tasks traditionally associated with commercial diving are not considered a scientific dive. Training and Proficiency Dives: Dives performed as part of a scientific diver -training program, or dives performed in maintenance of a scientific diving certification/authorization. Breathing Gas : Air: Dives where the bottom gas used for the dive is air. Nitrox: Dives where the bottom gas used for the dive is a combination of nitrogen and oxygen percentag es different from those of air. Mixed Gas: Dives where the bottom gas used for the dive is a combination of oxygen, nitrogen, and helium (or other inert gas), or any other breathing gas combination not classified as air or nitrox. 108 Diving Mode : Open Circui t SCUBA : Dives where the breathing gas is inhaled from a self -contained underwater breathing apparatus and all of the exhaled gas leaves the breathing loop. Surface Supplied: Dives where the breathing gas is supplied from the surface by means of a pressuri zed umbilical hose. The umbilical generally consists of a gas supply hose, strength member, pneumofathometer hose, and communication line. The umbilical suppl ies a helmet or full- face mask. The diver may rely on the tender at the surface to monitor the divers' depth, time and diving profile. Hookah: While similar to Surface Supplied in that the breathing gas is supplied from the surface by means of a pressurized hose, the supply hose does not require a strength member, pneumofathometer hose, or communication line. Hookah equipment may be as simple as a long hose attached to a standard scuba cylinder supplying a standard scuba second stage. The diver is responsible for monitoring his/her own depth, time, and diving profile. Rebreathers: Dives wher e the breathing gas is repeatedly recycled in a breathing loop. The breathing loop may be fully closed or semi -closed. Note: A rebreather dive ending in an open circuit bailout is still logged as a rebreather dive. Decompression Planning and Calculation Me thod: Dive Tables Dive Computer PC Based Decompression Software Depth Ranges : Depth rang es for sorting logged dives are: 0-30, 31- 60, 61- 191- 250, 251-300, and 301+. Depths are in feet seawater (when measured in meters: 0 -10, >10- 30, >30 -40, >40- >58- 76, >76- 92, and >92) . A dive is logged to the maximum depth reached during the dive. Note: Only \"The Number of Dives Logged\" and \"The Number of Divers Logging Dives\" will be collected f or this category. Specialized Environments : Required Decompression: Any dive where the diver exceeds the no -decompression limit of the decompression planning method being employed. Overhead Environments: Any dive where the diver does not have direct acce ss to the surface due to a physical obstruction. Blue Water Diving: Openwater diving where the bottom is generally greater than 200 feet deep and requir es the use of multiple -tether s diving techniques. Ice and Polar Diving: Any dive conducted under ice or in polar conditions. Note: An Ice Dive would also be classified as an Overhead Environment dive. Saturation Diving: Excursion dives conducted as part of a saturation mission are to be logged by \"classification\", \"mode\", \"gas\", etc. The \"surface\" for these excursions is defined as leaving and surfacing within the Habitat. Time spent within the Habitat or chamber must not be logged by AAUS. Aquarium: An aquarium is a shallow, confined body of water, which is operated by or under the control of an institution and is used for the purposes of specimen exhibit, education, husbandry, or research (Not a swimming pool) . 109 Incident Types : Hyperbaric: Decompression Sickness, AGE, or other barotrauma requiring recompression therapy. Barotrauma: Barotrauma requiring medi cal attention from a physician or medical facility, but not requiring recompression therapy. Injury: Any non -barotrauma injury occurring during a dive that requires medical attention from a physician or medical facility. Illness: Any illness requiring me dical attention that can be attributed to diving. Near Drowning/ Hypoxia: An incident where a person asphyxiates to the minimum point of unconsciousness during a dive involving a compressed gas. But the person recovers. Hyperoxic/Oxygen Toxicity: An inci dent that can be attributed to the diver being exposed to too high a partial pressure of oxygen. Hypercapnea: An incident that can be attributed to the diver being exposed to an excess of carbon dioxide. Fatality: Any death accruing during a dive or resulting from the diving exposure. Other: An incident that does not fit one of the listed incident types Incident Classification Rating Scale : Minor: Injuries that UM considers being minor in nature. Examples of this classification of incident would include, but not be limited to: Mask squeeze that produced discoloration of the eyes. Lacerations requiring medical attention but not involving moderate or severe bleeding. Other injuries that would not be expected to produce long term adverse effects on the diver's health or diving status. Moderate: Injuries that UM considers being moderate in nature. Examples of this classification would include, but not be limited to: DCS symptoms that resolved with the administration of oxygen, hyperbaric treatment given as a precaution. DCS symptoms resolved with the first hyperbaric treatment. Broken bones. Torn ligaments or cartilage. Concussion. Ear barotrauma requiring surgical repair. Serious: Injuri es that UM considers being serious in nature. Examples of this classification would include, but not be limited to: Arterial Gas Embolism. DCS symptoms requiring multiple hyperbaric treatment. Near drowning. Oxygen Toxicity. Hypercapnea. Spinal injuries. Heart attack. Fatality. 110 APPENDIX 9 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESCUE OF A SUBMERGED UNRESPONSIVE COMPRESSED- GAS DIVER From: S .J. Mitchell et al., Underse a and Hyperbaric Medicine 2012, Vol. 39, "}
