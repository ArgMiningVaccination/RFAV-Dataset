Content: basic principles and requirements Special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements. (1) The pharmacological and toxicological tests must show: a) the potential toxicity of the product and any dangerous or undesirable toxic effects that may occur under the proposed conditions of use in human beings; these should be evaluated in relation to the pathological condition concerned; b) the pharmacological properties of the product, in both qualitative and quantitative relationship to the proposed use in human beings. All results must be reliable and of general applicability. Whenever appropriate, mathematical and statistical procedures shall be used in designing the experimental methods and in evaluating the results. Additionally, it is necessary for clinicians to be given information about the therapeutic and toxicological potential of the product. (2) For biological medicinal products such as immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma, the requirements of thisDirective 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November... ANNEX I PART I Document Generated: 2023-08-1819 Status: EU Directives are being published on this site to aid cross referencing from UK legislation. After IP completion day (31 December 2020 11pm) no further amendments will be applied to this version. Module may have to be adapted for individual products; therefore the testing program carried out shall be justified by the applicant. In establishing the testing program, the following shall be taken into consideration: all tests requiring repeated administration of the product shall be designed to take account of the possible induction of, and interference by, antibodies; examination of reproductive function, of embryo/foetal and peri-natal toxicity, of mutagenic potential and of carcinogenic potential shall be considered. Where constituents other than the active substance(s) are incriminated, validation of their removal may replace the study. (3) The toxicology and pharmaco-kinetics of an excipient used for the first time in the pharmaceutical field shall be investigated. (4) Where there is a possibility of significant degradation during storage of the medicinal product, the toxicology of degradation products must be considered. 4.2.1. Pharmacology Pharmacology study shall follow two distinct lines of approach. \u2014 Firstly, the actions relating to the proposed therapeutic use shall be adequately investigated and described. Where possible, recognised and validated assays, both in vivo and in vitro, shall be used. Novel experimental techniques must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced. The results shall be expressed in quantitative terms using, for example, dose-effect curves, time-effect curves, etc. Wherever possible, comparisons shall be made with data relating to a substance or substances with a similar therapeutic action. \u2014 Secondly, the applicant shall investigate the potential undesirable pharmaco-dynamic effects of the substance on physiological functions. These investigations shall be performed at exposures in the anticipated therapeutic range and above. The experimental techniques, unless they are standard procedures, must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced, and the investigator must establish their validity. Any suspected modification of responses resulting from repeated administration of the substance shall be investigated. For the pharmaco-dynamic medicinal product interaction, tests on combinations of active substances may be prompted either by pharmacological premises or by indications of therapeutic effect. In the first case, the pharmaco-dynamic study shall demonstrate those interactions, which might make the combination of value in therapeutic use. In the second case, where scientific justification for the combination is sought through therapeutic experimentation, the investigation shall determine whether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstrated in animals, and the importance of any collateral effects shall at least be investigated. 4.2.2. Pharmaco-kinetics Pharmaco-kinetics means the study of the fate of the active substance, and its metabolites, within the organism, and covers the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism (bio- transformation) and excretion of these substances. The study of these different phases may be carried mainly by means of physical, chemical or possibly by biological methods, and by observation of the actual pharmaco-dynamic activity of the substance itself.20 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November... ANNEX I PART I Document Generated: 2023-08-18 Status: EU Directives are being published on this site to aid cross referencing from UK legislation. After IP completion day (31 December 2020 11pm) no further amendments will be applied to this version. Information on distribution and elimination shall be necessary in all cases where such data are indispensable to determine the dosage for humans, and in respect of chemo-therapeutic substances (antibiotics, etc.) and substances whose use depends on their non-pharmaco-dynamic effects (e.g. numerous diagnostic agents, etc.). In vitro studies also can be carried out with the advantage of using human material for comparison with animal material (i.e. protein binding, metabolism, drug-drug interaction). Pharmaco-kinetic investigation of all pharmacologically active substances is necessary. In the case of new combinations of known substances, which have been investigated in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be required, if the toxicity tests and therapeutic experimentation justify their omission. The pharmaco-kinetic program shall be design to allow comparison and extrapolation between animal and human. 4.2.3. Toxicology a) Single-dose toxicity A single-dose toxicity test shall mean a qualitative and quantitative study of the toxic reactions, which may result from a single administration of the active substance or substances contained in the medicinal product, in the proportions and physico- chemical state in which they are present in the actual product. The single-dose toxicity test must be carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. b) Repeat-dose toxicity Repeated dose toxicity tests are intended to reveal any physiological and/or anatomo- pathological changes induced by repeated administration of the active substance or combination of active substances under examination, and to determine how these changes are related to dosage. Generally, it is desirable that two tests be performed: one short term, lasting two to four weeks, the other long-term. The duration of the latter shall depend on the conditions of clinical use. Its purpose is to describe potential adverse effects to which attention should be paid in clinical studies. The duration is defined in the relevant guidelines published by the Agency. c) Geno-toxicity The purposes of the study of mutagenic and clastogenic potential is to reveal the changes which a substance may cause in the genetic material of individuals or cells. Mutagenic substances may present a hazard to health since exposure to a mutagen carries the risk of inducing germ-line mutation, with the possibility of inherited disorders, and the risk of somatic mutations including those leading to cancer. These studies are obligatory for any new substance. d) Carcino-genicity Tests to reveal carcinogenic effects shall normally be required: 1. These studies shall be performed for any medicinal product whose expected clinical use is for a prolonged period of a patient's life, either continuously or repeatedly in an intermittent manner.Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November... ANNEX I PART I Document Generated: 2023-08-1821 Status: EU Directives are being published on this site to aid cross referencing from UK legislation. After IP completion day (31 December 2020 11pm) no further amendments will be applied to this version. 2. These studies are recommended for some medicinal products if there is concern about their carcinogenic potential, e.g. from product of the same class or similar structure, or from evidence in repeated dose toxicity studies. 3. Studies with unequivocally geno-toxic compounds are not needed, as they are presumed to be trans-species carcinogens, implying a hazard to humans. If such a medicinal product is intended to be administered chronically to humans a chronic study may be necessary to detect early tumorigenic effects. e) Reproductive and developmental toxicity Investigation of possible impairment of male or female reproductive function as well as harmful effects on progeny shall be performed by appropriate tests. These tests comprise studies of effect on adult male or female reproductive function, studies of the toxic and teratogenic effects at all stages of development from conception to sexual maturity as well as latent effects, when the medicinal product under investigation has been administered to the female during pregnancy. Omission of these tests must be adequately justified. Depending on the indicated use of the medicinal product, additional studies addressing development when administering the medicinal product of the offspring may be warranted. Embryo/foetal toxicity studies shall normally be conducted on two mammalian species, one of which shall be other than a rodent. Peri- and postnatal studies shall be conducted in at least one species. If the metabolism of a medicinal product in particular species is known to be similar to that in man, it is desirable to include this species. It is also desirable that one of the species is the same as in the repeated dose toxicity studies. The state of scientific knowledge at the time when the application is lodged shall be taken into account when determining the study design. f) Local tolerance The purpose of local tolerance studies is to ascertain whether medicinal products (both active substances and excipients) are tolerated at sites in the body, which may come into contact with the medicinal product as a result of its administration in clinical use. The testing strategy shall be such that any mechanical effects of administration or purely physico-chemical actions of the product can be distinguished from toxicological or pharmaco-dynamic ones. Local tolerance testing shall be conducted with the preparation being developed for human use, using the vehicle and/or excipients in treating the control group(s). Positive controls/reference substances shall be included where necessary. The design of local tolerance tests (choice of species, duration, frequency and route of administration, doses) will depend upon the problem to be investigated and the proposed conditions of administration in clinical use. Reversibility of local lesions shall be performed where relevant. Studies in animals can be substituted by validated in vitro tests provided that the test results are of comparable quality and usefulness for the purpose of safety evaluation.22 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November...

After IP completion day (31 December 2020 11pm) no further amendments will be applied to this version. For chemicals applied to the skin (e.g. dermal, rectal, vaginal) the sensitising potential shall be evaluated in at least one of the test systems currently available (the guinea pig assay or the local lymph node assay). 5.

PART II SPECIFIC MARKETING AUTHORISATION DOSSIERS AND REQUIREMENTS Some medicinal products present specific features which are such that all the requirements of the marketing authorisation application dossier as laid down in Part I of this Annex need to be adapted. To take account of these particular situations, an appropriate and adapted presentation of the dossier shall be followed by applicants. 1. WELL-ESTABLISHED MEDICINAL USE For medicinal products the active substance(s) of which has/have a 'well-established medicinal use' as referred to Article 10(1)(a)(ii), with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety, the following specific rules shall apply. The applicant shall submit Modules 1, 2 and 3 as described in part I of this Annex. For Modules 4 and 5, a detailed scientific bibliography shall address non-clinical and clinical characteristics. The following specific rules shall apply in order to demonstrate the well-established medicinal use: a) Factors which have to be taken into account in order to establish a well-established medicinal use of constituents of medicinal products are: \u2014 the time over which a substance has been used, \u2014 quantitative aspects of the use of the substance,28 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November... ANNEX I PART II Document Generated: 2023-08-18 Status: EU Directives are being published on this site to aid cross referencing from UK legislation. After IP completion day (31 December 2020 11pm) no further amendments will be applied to this version. \u2014 the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the published scientific literature) and \u2014 the coherence of scientific assessments. Therefore different periods of time may be necessary for establishing well-established use of different substances. In any case, however, the period of time required for establishing a well established medicinal use of a constituent of a medicinal product must not be less than one decade from the first systematic and documented use of that substance as a medicinal product in the Community. b) The documentation submitted by the applicant should cover all aspects of the safety and/or efficacy assessment and must include or refer to a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre- and post-marketing studies and published scientific literature concerning experience in the form of epidemiological studies and in particular of comparative epidemiological studies. All documentation, both favourable and unfavourable, must be communicated. With respect to the provisions on 'well- established medicinal use ' it is in particular necessary to clarify that 'bibliographic reference ' to other sources of evidence (post marketing studies, epidemiological studies, etc.) and not just data related to tests and trials may serve as a valid proof of safety and efficacy of a product if an application explains and justifies the use of these sources of information satisfactorily. c) Particular attention must be paid to any missing information and justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety and/or efficacy can be supported although some studies are lacking. d) The non-clinical and/or clinical overviews must explain the relevance of any data submitted which concern a product different from the product intended for marketing. A judgement must be made whether the product studied can be considered as similar to the product, for which application for a marketing authorisation has been made in spite of the existing differences. e) Post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue. 2. ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS a) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (i) (essentially similar products) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex provided the applicant has been granted the consent of the holder of the original marketing authorisation to cross refer to the content of his Modules 4 and 5. b) Applications based upon Article 10(1) (a) (iii) (essentially similar products i.e. generics) shall contain the data described in Modules 1, 2 and 3 of Part I of this Annex together with data showing bio-availability and bio-equivalence with the original medicinal product provided the latter is not a biological medicinal product (see Part II, 4 Similar biological medicinal products). For these products the non-clinical/clinical overviews/summaries shall particularly focus on the following elements: \u2014 the grounds for claiming essential similarity; \u2014 a summary of impurities present in batches of the active substance(s) as well as those of the finished medicinal product (and where relevant decomposition products arising during storage) as proposed for use in the product to be marketed together with an evaluation of these impurities;Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November... ANNEX I PART II Document Generated: 2023-08-1829 Status: EU Directives are being published on this site to aid cross referencing from UK legislation. After IP completion day (31 December 2020 11pm) no further amendments will be applied to this version. \u2014 an evaluation of the bio-equivalence studies or a justification why studies were not performed with respect to the guideline on 'Investigation of Bio-availability and Bio- equivalence '; \u2014 an update of published literature relevant to the substance and the present application. It may be acceptable for articles in 'peer review ' journals to be annotated for this purpose; \u2014 every claim in the summary of product characteristics not known from or inferred from the properties of the medicinal product and/or its therapeutic group should be discussed in the non clinical/clinical overviews/summaries and substantiated by published literature and/or additional studies. \u2014 if applicable, additional data in order to demonstrate evidence on the equivalence of safety and efficacy properties of different salts, esters or derivatives of an authorised active substance should be provided by the applicant when he claims essential similarity. 3. ADDITIONAL DATA REQUIRED IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS Where the active substance of an essentially similar medicinal product contains the same therapeutic moiety as the original authorised product associated with a different salt/ester complex/derivative evidence that there is no change in the pharmaco-kinetics of the moiety, pharmaco-dynamics and/or in toxicity which could change the safety/efficacy profile shall be demonstrated. Should this not be the case, this association shall be considered as a new active substance. Where a medicinal product is intended for a different therapeutic use or presented in a different pharmaceutical form or to be administered by different routes or in different doses or with a different posology, the results of appropriate toxicological and pharmacological tests and/or of clinical trials shall be provided. 4. SIMILAR BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS The provisions of Article 10(1)(a) (iii) may not be sufficient in the case of biological medicinal products. If the information required in the case of essentially similar products (generics) does not permit the demonstration of the similar nature of two biological medicinal products, additional data, in particular, the toxicological and clinical profile shall be provided. When a biological medicinal product as defined in Part I, paragraph 3.2 of this Annex, which refers to an original medicinal product having been granted a marketing authorisation in the Community, is submitted for a marketing authorisation by an independent applicant after the expiry of data protection period, the following approach shall be applied. \u2014 Information to be supplied shall not be limited to Modules 1, 2 and 3 (pharmaceutical, chemical and biological data), supplemented with bio-equivalence and bio-availability data. The type and amount of additional data (i.e. toxicological and other non-clinical and appropriate clinical data) shall be determined on a case by case basis in accordance with relevant scientific guidelines. \u2014 Due to the diversity of biological medicinal products, the need for identified studies foreseen in Modules 4 and 5, shall be required by the competent authority, taking into account the specific characteristic of each individual medicinal product. The general principles to be applied are addressed in a guideline taking into account the characteristics of the concerned biological medicinal product published by the Agency. In case the originally authorised medicinal product has more than one indication, the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product claimed to be similar has to be justified or, if necessary, demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications.30 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November...

FIXED COMBINATION MEDICINAL PRODUCTS Applications based upon Article 10 (1) (b) shall relate to new medicinal products made of at least two active substances not previously authorised as a fixed combination medicinal product. For those applications a full dossier (Modules 1 to 5) shall be provided for the fixed combination medicinal product. Where applicable, information regarding the manufacturing sites and the adventitious agents, safety evaluation shall be provided. 6. DOCUMENTATION FOR APPLICATIONS IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES When, as provided for in Article 22, the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because: \u2014 the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or \u2014 in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or \u2014 it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information, marketing authorisation may be granted subject to certain specific obligations. These obligations may include the following: \u2014 the applicant shall complete an identified programme of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which shall form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile, \u2014 the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radio-pharmaceutical, by an authorised person, \u2014 the package leaflet and any medical information shall draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects. 7. MIXED MARKETING AUTHORISATION APPLICATIONS Mixed marketing-authorisation applications shall mean marketing-authorisation application dossiers where Module 4 and/or 5 consists of a combination of reports of limited non-clinical and/or clinical studies carried out by the applicant and of bibliographical references. All other Module(s) are in accordance with the structure described in Part I of this Annex. The competent authority shall accept the proposed format presented by the applicant on a case by case basis.

The stability during use of radio-pharmaceuticals in multi-dose vials shall be documented. Module 4 It is appreciated that toxicity may be associated with a radiation dose. In diagnosis, this is a consequence of the use of radio-pharmaceuticals; in therapy, it is the property desired. The evaluation of safety and efficacy of radio-pharmaceuticals shall, therefore, address requirements for medicinal products and radiation dosimetry aspects. Organ/tissue exposure to radiation shall be documented. Absorbed radiation dose estimates shall be calculated according to a specified, internationally recognised system by a particular route of administration. Module 5 The results of clinical trials shall be provided where applicable otherwise justified in the clinical overviews. 2.2. Radio-pharmaceutical precursors for radio-labelling purposes In the specific case of a radio-pharmaceutical precursor intended solely for radio-labelling purposes, the primary objective shall be to present information which would address the possible consequences of poor radio-labeling efficiency or in vivo dissociation of the radio-labeled conjugate, i.e. questions related to the effects produced in the patient by free radio-nuclide. In addition, it is also necessary to present relevant information relating to occupational hazards, i.e. radiation exposure to hospital staff and to the environment. In particular, the following information where applicable shall be provided: Module 3 The provisions of Module 3 shall apply to the registration of radio-pharmaceutical precursors as define above (indents a) to i)), where applicable. Module 4 Concerning single dose and repeat dose toxicity, the results of studies carried out in conformity with the provisions related to good laboratory practice laid down in Council Directives 87/18/ EEC and 88/320/EEC shall be provided, unless otherwise justified.
