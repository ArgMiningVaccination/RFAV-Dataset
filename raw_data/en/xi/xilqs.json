INTRODUCTI0N Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) includes many practices and products used to promote and maintain health and wellness or treat human illness . \"Patients are using them. Although some healthcare providers specialize in CAM, individuals can buy and use CAM treatments without medical advice or prescriptions . Intercultural exchanges and CAM use have increased worldwide. CONT'D Time and time again, research finds that the majority of the population is using integrative health products, and this rate is much higher for patients with higher socioeconomic status and/or patients who suffer from chronic health conditions,\" says Jessie Hawkins. \"Without guidance from their care providers, patients are left to self- educate through online sources. This results in reduced efficacy at best and injury at worst.\" All therapies were once considered alternative\u2014even antibiotics. We know that there is far more to healing than just applying a chemical compound or mechanical procedure to the human form\u2014 that intrinsic mind and spirit aspect can be a real determining factor in whether or not a patient gets better. TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES IN NIGERIA Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicines Department came into being following the approval by the Head of Service in a letter OHCSF/MSO/72/IV/132 dated 4th April, 2018. The activities of the Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicines Department commenced fully in July 2018 In Nigeria. DEFINITIONS Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM): The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines CAM as \"a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that aren't generally considered part of conventional medicine.\" Sometimes called Western or allopathic medicine, conventional medicine is that practiced by healthcare providers who are medical doctors or nurses etc. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE When a health care provider uses complementary medicine, it's used in conjunction with common Western medicine CAM may complement conventional medicine when they're used together. When such a combination is backed by high-quality evidence, it's known as integrative medicine. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE When the provider uses alternative medicine, it's used in place of common, Western medicine. CAM may be used as an alternative to conventional treatment Both words refer to non- mainstream treatments such as aromatherapy, meditation, massage WHY PATIENTS USE CAM Relieve symptoms Ease treatment side effects Improve quality of life Seem natural and non toxic Comfort and satisfaction from the touch, talk and time Might help control or cure their cancer The Most Commonly Used CAM -Acupuncture, -Reiki -Aromatherapy, -Hypnosis, massage therapy, -Meditation -Therapeutic touch, and -Vitamins/herbal supplements. -Tai Chi. Reiki Reiki is a form of complementary medicine; there's evidence it can reduce daily stress and help with management of some chronic diseases. Reiki is an energy healing technique that involves a Reiki master using gentle hand movements to guide the flow of healthy energy through the body to reduce stress and promote healing. APPLICATIONS OF SOME OF THE CAMS AROMATHERAPY OILS Aromatherapy oils are now used post-op in some hospitals to reduce anxiety and pain after surgery so that patients will require less pain medications. Meditation Meditation has been used in psychiatry through progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and mindfulness meditation to augment the practices of cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectic behavioral therapy. TAI CHI Tai Chi has been shown to improve balance and flexibility for older adults and thereby reducing falls in long-term care and community settings,\" explains Baxter (2018). HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS Herbal supplements such as CBD oil have shown some efficacy in reducing seizures, pain, and anxiety. HYPNOSIS Hypnosis is a treatment that is offered for smoking cessation and obesity treatment. Massage therapy and acupuncture Massage therapy and acupuncture have been demonstrated to be beneficial in addiction treatment STEM CELL They have the potential to repair, restore, replace, and regenerate cells, But unproven stem cell therapies can be particularly unsafe. Attendees at a 2016 FDA public workshop discussed several cases of severe adverse events. One patient became blind due to an injection of stem cells into the eye. Another patient received a spinal cord injection that caused the growth of a spinal tumor. stem cells are the cells that develop into blood, brain, bones, and all of the body's organs. Stem cells have been called everything from cure-alls to miracle treatments. SAFETY CONCERN 1. New products may appear in a health food store without local community understanding or guidelines for proper use. The nurse acquiring knowledge about what's safe and effective presents an ongoing challenge to practitioners everywhere. For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has encouraged national dialogue and policy development to prevent misunderstandings, inappropriate use, and harmful indications SAFETY CONCERN 2 2. Very limited research on the use of herbs and dietary supplements such as St. John's wort, gbogbonse, ciwo Tara, agbo, Echinacea, ginkgo biloba, Stem Cell, glucosamine, chondroitin, and red yeast rice has produced conflicting results. Examples of unsafe herbal supplements include comfrey, which can damage the liver, and licorice root, which in large doses may alter Blood Pressure SAFETY CONCERN 3. Another safety concern is that some patients don't tell their healthcare professional about their CAM therapy or fail to provide a complete list . Consequently, they may experience unexpected interactions with prescribed drugs or treatment failure. They may not disclose CAM therapy because they don't consider these products to be medications or they fear criticism or lack confidence in the healthcare professional's knowledge about CAM REGULATORY ISSUES The FDA approves an over-the-counter (OTC) drug only when it's proven safe and efficacious for treating the indications for which it's marketed. The container must display a prominent standardized label with FDA-required product information and instructions for safe use. In contrast, most herbal products distributed in tablet or capsule form lack similar controls and labels. Patients may assume they're safe because they look like drugs and are often sold at pharmacies. Herbs sold as dietary supplements are subject to alternative regulations, but proof of efficacy or safety isn't required REGULATORY ISSUES CONT... A therapeutic herbal supplement may be composed of a plant or botanical or a portion of a plant's roots, leaves, flowers, or seeds. Although herbal products are purchased OTC, their manufacture and delivery to the consumer differ from that of other OTC drugs that are fully FDA-controlled. According to federal regulations, herbs are considered dietary supplements as defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. Companies are required only to follow good manufacturing practices and to post a label stating that the product hasn't been evaluated by the FDA REGULATORY ISSUES CONT... The NCCAM cautions consumers that a herbal supplement may contain more or less than the labeled amount of its ingredient. It may also contain many unexpected or unknown ingredients, including other plant species, pesticides, metals, or prescription drugs. Although the FDA doesn't routinely screen herbal supplements for these ingredients, if any are reported, the FDA may issue a warning to the manufacturer or in some cases ban the product's sale. REGULATORY ISSUES CONT... In 2006, the U.S. Congress passed Public Law 109-462, known as the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act. This act requires manufacturers, distributors, and importers to self-report any adverse events to the FDA. Events such as related injuries, hospitalizations, or birth defects traceable to a herb or dietary supplement must also be reported. REGULATORY ISSUES CONT...

NURSING CONSIDERATIONS During medication reconciliation, determine whether patients use or intend to use CAM, including herbal supplements. Assess their knowledge of their health status, diseases, and treatments. Identify any potential interactions of drugs and herbal remedies and document them in the medical record, then follow up with the patient and provider as indicated NURSING CONSIDERATIONS Consider a patient's economic constraints and cultural preferences. Help educate patients about how to make informed choices. Evaluate their understanding of the difference between OTC \"drugs\" and \"food supplements,\" such as herbs provided in tablet or capsule form that are unregulated and lack NAFDA approval. Caution patients about the potential for fraudulent advertising, especially on the Internet. Warn patients that advertisers who lack scientific data to support their claims often use testimonials from users. Encourage patients to fully disclose their CAM supplement use to their healthcare providers. NURSING CONSIDERATIONS IN THE USE OF CAM Encourage patients to share, question, and exchange ideas and practices about their healthcare choices. Be prepared to help patients express their beliefs and preferences, identify dependable information, and avoid making uninformed decisions and purchases \"Avoid a one-size-fits-all approach. Like medications, what works for one person may not work for another WHAT NURSES NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CAM Patients are using alternative therapies, and that use is increasing Don't be like your patients and simply look up information about CAM online . If you want to implement it into your practice, it's necessary for you to get some kind of formal education Integrative health is a concept that is rapidly growing and expanding worldwide \"Continuing education in integrative health is one of the best career investments a nurse can make CARING FOR SPECIAL POPULATIONS Older adults. Researchers assessed OTC medication and supplement use from 2005 to 2006 in community-dwelling residents ages 57 to 85. One out of 25 older adults who combined prescription and nonprescription medications was found to be at risk for major drug-drug interactions. Supplements these older adults used included calcium, vitamin D, glucosamine-chondroitin, omega-3 fatty acids, garlic, coenzyme Q, and saw palmetto CONT'D In a national health survey of adults over age 65, herbs were found to be an important factor in self-managed healthcare. Predictors of herbal use included gender, ethnicity, culture, and level of education. Educate older adults about potential drug-drug interactions, including those caused by mixing prescription or OTC drugs and herbs. CONT'D However, they discovered that over half of the CAM users didn't reveal their CAM use to their primary care providers. More research needs to be done to predict which patients are less likely to disclose their use of CAM. Always query older patients about their CAM use. PREGNANT PATIENTS The use of herbal preparations in pregnancy hasn't been directly measured and isn't well understood, but an integrative literature review and meta-analysis from 1995 to 2006 found that pregnant women use a wide variety of OTC drugs and herbal supplements. More research is needed about the use of prescription and OTC drugs during pregnancy, but clinical trials involving pregnant patients raise ethical considerations due to fetal risks, making evaluation difficult. When a medication's safety during pregnancy hasn't been established, a pregnant patient shouldn't use it unless its benefit is clearly greater than any potential fetal risk PEDIATRIC PATIENTS Oral CAM therapy in children also needs further study. Little research supports the efficacy of herbs for chronic diseases such as asthma in pediatric patients. CAM use might be high in children with asthma who have adverse reactions to steroids, which drives their parents to seek CAM. Ask parents if they administer any CAM products or supplements to their children. Advise them to get their pediatric healthcare provider's advice before doing so. SUMMARY Medicine is evolving, as is the state of health. It's critical to explore options and be at the forefront of new therapies It is essential that nurses have knowledge about common CAM and obtain information to elicit use of CAM therapies from the patient history. It's important to help patients get information from reliable sources and to know if a suggested alternative treatment, such as herbal supplements, may interfere with the medications they are currently prescribed or may be detrimental to their health.
