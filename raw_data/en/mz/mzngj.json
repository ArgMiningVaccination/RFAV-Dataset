Alexander Dorr and John Dorr: This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://www.mushroom-revival.com/ in November 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Cordyceps Militaris, Reishi, and Mush-10. The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA's home page at [www.fda.gov.](//www.fda.gov.) Examples of website claims that establish that your products are intended for use as drugs include: The product page for Cordyceps Militaris shows a link titled \"Visit Our Know Your Mushrooms Page for More Info.\" Your \"Know Your Mushrooms\" page for Cordyceps (Cordyceps Militaris) states, under \"Cordyceps may contain anti-viral properties . . . and alleviate respiratory diseases.

As an antihistamine, Reishi provides a relaxing effect to asthmatic symptoms.\" Your \"Know Your Mushrooms\" page for Reishi states, under the \"IMMUNITY\" tab, \"It is often and historically used in protocols for the treatment of cancer due to its revered immunomodulating and tonic qualities.

Studies show that Maitake increases the production of insulin and controls glucose levels, resulting in a decrease in blood sugar levels.\" Under the \"IMMUNE\" tab: \"Maitake's strong immunomodulatory properties, like polysaccharides and beta-glucans, make Maitake highly regarded clinically for cancer and chemotherapies.\" Under the \"MORE INFO\" tab, it states \"***Maitake has traditionally been used in Japan . . . to prevent cancer and high blood pressure.\" your \"Know Your Mushrooms\" page for Shitake (Lentinula 10): Under the \"IMMUNITY\" tab: \"Shiitake has been shown to contain powerful anti-viral, antimicrobial, and anti-candida properties, that help us fight infections.

An important example of Chaga disrupting the assembly of this DNA is in HIV. Betulinic acid, primarily growing in the bark of white birch, is a triterpenoid which possesses these properties and contains anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory constituents.

New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). \"Adequate directions for use\" means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Your products Cordyceps Militaris, Reishi, and Mush-10 are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Cordyceps Militaris, Reishi, and Mush-10 fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)]. The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Lillian C. Aveta, Compliance Officer, 158-15 Liberty Ave., Jamaica, NY 11433.
