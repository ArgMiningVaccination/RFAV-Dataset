Later this year , supporters in England and Wales will be able to become a Dementia Friends Ambassador , which has replaced the role of Dementia Friends Champion. Since 2013, champions have transformed the way the nation thinks, acts and talks about dementia by holding sessions to create millions of Dementia Friends. Dementia Friends Ambassadors will continue this vital work. Their role will now also include raising awareness of everything we do - making sure people know we're here for them and how they can provide support. This will have greater impact for people affected by dementia. In Northern Ireland, the role of Dementia Friendly Community Champion currently remains in place. For more information about Dementia Friends Ambassadors, email dementiafriends@alzheimers.org.uk or call 0300 222 5855. News Councillor Network We've created a new network for local councillors and other elected representatives to make sure they understand the importance of prioritising dementia in their area. Our new Councillor Network will keep local elected representatives updated with the latest information and research about dementia. This will make them understand the role they can play in influencing other decision-makers and how to provide the best advice to their constituents. Make sure your local elected representative knows about our Councillor Network - ask them to email local@alzheimers.org.uk All party group in Northern Ireland Politicians in Northern Ireland have agreed to set up a specialist dementia group following calls from Alzheimer's Society . The first ever All Party Group on Dementia, supported by us, will allow people affected by dementia to keep MLAs informed of the challenges they're facing. The group will also monitor the rollout of the Regional Dementia Care Pathway - a vision for high quality dementia services - and social care reforms.

Cymru conference: T ake control The lived experiences of people affected by dementia in Wales were at the heart of our recent Alzheimer's Society Cymru conference, which focused on diagnosis. With professionals and people with a personal connection to dementia attending, speakers examined how a diagnosis should not define someone, but instead empower them to take control of their lives. There were also presentations and discussions on the importance of a timely diagnosis, using technology to improve diagnosis, and how to improve diagnosis among Black, Asian and other minority ethnic communities.Dementia Friends Ambassadors 5 Joining our fabulous team on the Society's stand at Pride in London this summer (see p20) was such an energising experience! It underlined just how important it is for us to be out there connecting with all communities, so that everyone knows we're here for them. Whatever political dramas continue to unfold, that's where our focus needs to remain - on how to create real change for people affected by dementia, who too often struggle to get the right support at the right time. We don't miss a beat in making sure that national and local decision- makers understand the realities in getting - and paying for - dementia care, and the dire lack of proper support from diagnosis onwards. We're also backing research and innovations that will transform day-to-day life for people with dementia, as well as one day defeating the condition. Of course, the real engine behind all of this is you - people affected by dementia who share their experiences and hopes, and supporters and volunteers who turn brilliant ideas into even better action. A big thank you to each and every one of you! I look forward to every chance to meet more of you, but that's especially true for this autumn's Memory Walk. There are 25 events across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus you can organise your own.

This may relate to physical problems, such as urinary tract infections, as well as making the person feel anxious or embarrassed. It can be challenging for carers too, and is often a factor in deciding that someone needs residential care. Researchers at the University of Southampton have been investigating whether continence care in England has improved since issues with services were reported 10 years ago. Their Society-funded study recruited people through Join Dementia Research to interview them about their experiences. Many were unaware that support services were available, and those who were thought these were still unsatisfactory . Often this was because the products supplied, such as incontinence pads, weren't fit for purpose and not enough were provided. Many professionals also felt they weren't given enough training or resources to effectively support someone who was incontinent. Interviewees had a range of ideas about how to make services better . Listening to people affected by dementia and those who support them is essential to improving continence services. This research provides important evidence about what needs to change.

Longitude technology prize The Society is supporting a multimillion pound prize for new technology to help people with dementia remain independent in their own homes for longer . We've partnered with Innovate UK and the Medical Research Council to launch the new Longitude Prize on Dementia. Delivered by prize experts Challenge Works, it will open in September . For more about the Longitude Prize, see www.longitudeprize.orgSouth Asian communities The need for better support before and after a dementia diagnosis among England's South Asian communities was highlighted in a recent Society- commissioned report. Recommendations from the report's author Karan Jutlla, Dementia Lead at the University of Wolverhampton's Institute of Health, include for there to be dementia link workers to help people navigate services and more resources in South Asian languages.Support following a dementia diagnosis in England is unequal, inconsistent and inadequate. One in five carers say a lack of support has meant that their relative or friend with dementia ended up in A&E. Our recent report, Left to Cope Alone: The unmet support needs after a dementia diagnosis, also found that 61% of people affected by dementia did not feel they had received enough support in the last 12 months. In addition, 54% of family carers reached crisis point in the last year alone, with families having no idea of what support was available. This left people with dementia at risk of going to hospital for avoidable reasons, such as falls or urinary tract infections. We're calling for the introduction of more dementia support workers - specialists in the community who provide the missing link between families and support after a diagnosis.

Kath, who was diagnosed with dementia in December 2021, made the move after fearing that she would become isolated. Kath lives in an apartment at Belong Wigan, where she has her own space as well as support and facilities. She is very happy in her new home and believes that other people with dementia could benefit from a similar move. 9After someone receives a dementia diagnosis, or as their condition progresses, they may need or wish to move to an alternative home. For many with more advanced dementia, a care home or nursing home can be the most appropriate setting. But for Kath Sutherland, who was only diagnosed late last year , an apartment within a care village has proved to be the perfect place. 'I didn't want to be at home by myself - I would have been too isolated,' says 82-year old Kath, who is from Liverpool but now lives in Wigan. 'I think I settled in here straight away really . It's all so lovely , so friendly , and there's so much going on.' Moving out of home and into a care setting is obviously a big transition for anyone, but Kath has embraced her new surroundings. 'The change has been fine - it's part of life,' she says. 'I've accepted it, and I'm loving it here.' Desert drive Kath grew up as one of four siblings in a terraced house in Liverpool. 'I always just enjoyed it there,' she says. 'It was an in-between area - it wasn't posh, but it wasn't rough!' After leaving school, Kath went into bookkeeping, before taking on an accountancy role in the same office. After starting a family with her husband Keith, who worked in printing, she switched to various jobs including shop work and cleaning. Kath had met Keith at a 'dance place' in Liverpool, which she thinks was either the Grafton Ballroom or Liverpool Irish Centre. They were married in 1970 and have two children. 'I loved having children,' she says. 'And when you get older , you realise how lucky you are to have children who can help you out.' Not long after their wedding, Kath and Keith moved to Australia. 'It was the \u00a310 scheme, where they paid for your return air fare as long as you stayed for two years,' explains Kath. 'I'd always enjoyed going there on holiday , and they were asking for printers to go over , so Keith had a job to go to. 'It was lovely weather , beaches - just brilliant. I loved it out there! We crossed over the desert by train. The car was on the back of the train and the train took you so far , then you had to drive. 'I'd rather have stayed over there, but Keith was homesick and desperate to come back after the two years, so I agreed. We didn't ever go back - without the scheme we couldn't afford it.' Challenging times Kath was diagnosed with dementia in December 2021, after she moved to Belong Wigan, a care village in Greater Manchester . 'I remember when I was younger , someone saying, \"You've got a memory like Nellie the Elephant - you never forget anything.\" 'But last year , when I was getting phone calls, I could never remember after putting the phone down. \"What did they say then?\" 'It didn't concern me at first. It was my children who noticed it more than me. 'I then went through a spell where I wasn't well - water infection after water infection. At first, they were saying it was because of the water infections that I was getting confused. Then my husband was diagnosed with dementia and after that my memory just went downhill.' Kath says she's benefitted from dementia medication. Her mum and sisters all had dementia, as does Kath's sister now too. 'I never really thought I'd get dementia, but I also wasn't surprised when it happened, as it's well within my Mum's family ,' says Kath. 'Because of that, I accepted it more. 'I've always got paper and pen next to me for phone calls. But I do forget where I put things at times! 'I tend to laugh dementia off, as it's just part of life to me. You've just got to accept whatever happens.' Independent It was actually Keith who first lived at Belong Wigan, while Kath stayed with her daughter for around six months before also making the Worried about becoming isolated, Kath Sutherland moved from her house to a care village. Gareth Bracken meets a woman with dementia stepping into new surroundings. Home comfort10move. The couple were both at Belong for a while before Keith moved out, and he's now waiting to go into a nursing home in Liverpool, closer to the family . Kath lives in one of the care village's independent living apartments, where she has her own space but can also access staff support, as well as facilities such as a bistro, hair salon and gym. She explains that moving out of the family home was in her best interests. 'It was too big a house for me to stay in, with three gardens to look after , which I couldn't have done,' she says. 'I used to go to a pensioner's club, but that closed down. I'd just have been sitting at home, looking at four walls.' Kath is now thriving at the care village. 'It's great here, I love it!' she says. 'The atmosphere, all the activities that go on, the friends I've made. They pulled me in as soon as I arrived. One of them said, \"Come to see us, cock!\" And that was it. 'I did work in a care home at one time - possibly that's helped me as well.' Kath regularly gets involved in arts, dance and socials. 'There's always something on most days, I'll have a go,' she says. 'It's brought me out of myself more. I was always shy , but I'm a bit more confident now, I think.' Help anybody Kath is visited by her son, daughter and grandchildren every weekend, while she also appreciates the support and assistance on offer from the village's staff. 'I have carers coming into me every morning, that give me my medication, because my son noticed I was trying to take them twice!' she says. 'Someone cleans the place while I'm in the shower , and the reception calls me every morning to check you're alright and tell you what's for lunch. 'I know there's always help if I need it. I can just pick up the phone and call, or press my pendant.' Kath is very happy with her decision to move home, and believes that a similar switch could help others as well. 'Someone I know, who also has dementia, was adamant that they wouldn't go into a care home \"with the TV on all day\". That was their vision of it,' she says. 'But they've just deteriorated, sitting by the window, watching who goes past. I think their life's terrible really .' Kath hopes that sharing her positive experience of moving to a care setting might benefit other people with dementia. 'If my story is going to help people, that's fine,' she says. 'I think that the likes of this place would help anybody .' And as she continues to enjoy her new home, Kath is very much focused on the present, rather than spending too much time thinking about the future. 'I'm that type - whatever happens, happens. What's meant to be, will be,' she says. 'At the moment, I'm quite happy with life.'

When I phone somebody, I forget what I phoned for . I apologise and say I'll phone you back if I remember . I've forgotten how to play some of the games I used to play. My comprehension is not good. I went to a charity meeting recently but couldn't understand what was going on. Things which I used to like on TV , now I don't like. I've also noticed my vocabulary has gone. I can't speak the words I want to speak. There may be something in my mind, but I just can't express it. There was a street party here recently - I didn't want to meet or talk to anybody . I think it's the dementia. Before that, I used to meet with people and talk to them. Regular routine I have a very regular routine and, as long as that goes correctly , I'm not upset at all. I'll get up and do this, do that - breakfast, washing up, reading the Qur'an, writing in my diary . But if anything happens in that routine, if the routine changes, I forget what I was doing. That's what upsets me. Sometimes I'm talking to somebody on the phone and I've got something to ask them, but if my wife interrupts me, I forget what I'm going to ask. I don't like it if I'm reading and somebody comes to the door . If my wife Zohra wasn't here, I'd go mad! Many times I've had to ask her things which before I could do myself. She's got her eye on me all the time. This morning I left the stove on after cooking breakfast. I get frightened when she goes out, because if anything happens to her , I don't know what will happen to me. Perhaps if she wasn't here, I'd have gone very bad, very soon. Improve understanding I'm part of the Time for Dementia programme. I talk with medical students about dementia. They want to know more about me, so I give them as much information as I can provide. Whatever I can offer to help people understand more is good. I'm a retired GP and I remember seeing dementia patients when I was in practice - they usually thought they were depressed. I talk to the students about the workings of medicine, how I used to do my work and diagnose patients. Old things come back to me. I advise them that the patient may be self-conscious about it. Be calm, collected, and give the patient your full attention. I also advise them that they should know more about their patient's family and history . If you know people well, you can catch changes when they come in. This is how a doctor has to be. I think people should know more about dementia. And if people with dementia can help, they should also help.

There were about 300 entries. It's a 101km ride from Bangor to Portaferry and back around the Ards Peninsula, between the Irish Sea and Strangford Lough. We went down the coast side, with a bit of food and water at Portaferry , and then back up the other side. I'd seen a crowd of people doing it before. It was an ambition of mine. I thought if I do it, I'll do it for some good. Alzheimer's Society helps many people, including people of my vintage and older . I decided to raise money for them it because I think it's a very worthwhile charity . Dementia affects everyone, and it is a big deal in my age group. T ough start I'm 74 and I've cycled throughout my life, but it only became a serious hobby a few years ago. I found it awkward getting out of the chair . I was 115kg - not light. I decided I'd do something about it. I had a bike I'd bought in about 1980-something. I started riding a bit more regularly , though it was tough at the start. I've bought a more upmarket bike since then and I joined North Down Cycling Club two years ago. They organise the Bangor Coastal Challenge. I had been practising for the challenge for a few months, and I got a kick out of doing it. I was actually pleasantly surprised with how it went on the day . On the coastal road, you're basically on the shore with the wind blowing. It was tough for maybe 20-30 minutes, but once in-shore it wasn't too bad. I did it in less than 5.5 hours. Blown away I enjoyed the finish. The course climbs a bit before going back down into Bangor , but I did it. The roar at the finish was fantastic, it still makes me feel a bit emotional. I've done a lot in my life - sailing, marathons, public speaking - but that knocked me off my feet a bit. I'm not used to that sort of adulation! I have been blown away by all the support I received and would like to sincerely thank everyone who gave so generously to make this donation possible. I would also like to say a special thank you to all the members of North Down Cycling Club who made this cycle possible and supported me every step of the way . The fundraising total was over \u00a31,550 and I never expected that much, I thought it was brilliant. I'd set a target of \u00a3300 but all the donors blew that out of the water .

I don't want my core identity erased or ignored, I want it front and centre and celebrated, not pathologised. Chris: Well, said! It's a space where we can truly be ourselves. Very often in other meetings, you feel that you can't always talk about your sexuality , but on the advisory group that's what it's all about. Mike: When you're around predominantly heterosexual people, how do you talk about some of the difficulties of being a gay person, which they may or may not be willing to hear? For 20 years, my husband and I could not be affectionate with one another in public, even with family . The social conditioning wasn't there for me to feel good about it. The legacy of that is nurses or other clinicians don't understand us, they've never known us as a couple in a loving relationship. I feel inhibited by that. Can you imagine feeling inhibited at that critical moment of your life together? The group helps to voice those differences, so people understand that. We've been running webinars to generate interest, networks and enquiries. They gave people an opportunity to hear those words, which they wouldn't necessarily get easily elsewhere. Chris: I would describe us as trailblazers. We have set the fire alight and we're making ground. I hope we are setting that trail for younger people to follow behind us. We have started this ball rolling, a huge thing to do, and we want people to get on board and carry on the support. Not take over from us but work with us. My hope is that it will encourage more people to join the advisory group. D\u00e1ith\u00ed: It's not only LGBTQ+, we're also battling ageism and ableism, all of these things, and as the momentum grows, hopefully there will be collaboration there.Chris: There are so many people out there, with so many gifts and talents. We want to use those talents. We need people to come and join us and be a part of this journey . D\u00e1ith\u00ed: We're still glowing in the afterglow of the success of recent webinars. It was a lot of hard work, but we want to really prioritise what's next. People's lives are on the line. Mike: We're a melting pot of ideas and people positively putting things into action. We're actually getting things done. Chris: We haven't got all the time in the world, and I want to do what I can whilst I can. It's no good saying to me, 'Oh, you can do this five years down the line.' I don't know if I'll be here, so we've got that urgency to do things now.

Memory - The clearest stars I have ever seen, in the Cairngorms. Why dementia research? A key player and motivator was observing my grandfather's cognitive decline and how it affected my grandmother in Japan. In my undergraduate studies, I found the immune system to be very interesting (and relevant to my body) and I specialised in immunology and infection. I found out there was a way you could apply our understanding of the immune system to dementia research. And here I am today!How has Alzheimer's Society supported your work? Throughout my PhD, I have been lucky enough to meet up and discuss the project with Barry , Monica and Peter - the Alzheimer's Society Research Network volunteers who are assigned to my project. I attended the Society's Early Career Researcher Retreat this summer to discuss my work with fellow researchers. The travel grant within my studentship also enabled me to attend and present my work at the Alzheimer's Research UK 2022 conference in Brighton. What are you currently working on? What is the role of the antiviral immune system in Alzheimer's disease? This is the question I am trying to answer in my PhD. I am investigating immune molecules that are crucial for controlling a viral infection, to see how they affect the toxic build-up of proteins in the brain that we see occurring in Alzheimer's. In my every day , this means I look after brain cells that we use to model how the disease develops. I use a microscope to monitor the protein aggregation, which gets me some lovely images. What difference do you hope this will make? I hope that this work will explain at least one of the many complex interactions between the immune system and the brain. If we can work out what components of the immune system are detrimental in the disease, this might give us a target and lead us closer to a treatment that slows its progression. In what direction would you like to take your research in future? Many people regularly take anti- inflammatory drugs for a wide range of diseases. I am really interested in understanding the effects of these drugs in our models of Alzheimer's disease. Our hope is that some of these drugs might have a future role to play in reducing the risk or slowing the progression of Alzheimer's.Meet the researcher: Sophie Sanford PhD student at the UK Dementia Research Institute, University of Cambridge. \u00a315.50 could pay for an hour of supporting PhD students to conduct research projects.

Jacqui Keylock I found adult colouring very relaxing. It was something I could do and still be fully alert to anything my late husband got up to. He had young onset frontotemporal dementia and was still fit, and would stack furniture and then climb it etc. I needed something to calm my mind - going day to day , just about coping and some days not coping at all, was relentless. When Hubby had his shutdown periods, which went on for hours or days at a time, it meant I could sit on the bed with him so that if he awoke he felt safe. A new level of calmness, now I can lose myself still in colouring a picture.Janet Palmer , Warwickshire When I was a carer for my mother- in-law, who had dementia, it was very helpful to attend a group so that I could meet other families in the same situation. Protected time with a number of other carers, so that we could share experiences and feelings with each other and with the group facilitator , was really important. It helps you realise that you are not the only person feeling stressed and at a loss, and also that others have felt the same and worked through the issues. The support group was once a week with a charity called Springfield Mind. It is easier to feel close to people (even strangers) when you have a subject such as dementia in common.Susie Mackenzie, North Yorkshire I practise mindfulness - with emotions, this means allowing myself to feel a difficult feeling (anger , sadness, fear) rather than hide or supress it. Not repressing or supressing a difficult emotion means it does not sit in my head or body , with thoughts and feelings feeding off each other and making me feel worse. I cared for my mother when she had vascular dementia. Mindfulness really came in useful when I was dealing with difficult situations with her . For example, she might say something out of anger or frustration, but I learned to use mindfulness to hear a remark, breathe and then respond in a more helpful way instead of snapping back.How I find a bit of peace We ask people about how they keep well, whether they have dementia or not. This issue, we hear about dealing with stress and difficult feelings. Some things that affect your chance of developing dementia are things you can't change, like your age and genes. However , you can keep your mind and body active, enjoy healthier food, not smoke, drink less alcohol, stay in touch with people and deal with any health problems. If you already have dementia, the same things can help you to stay well. Visit www.nhs.uk/livewell for wellness advice for everyone. Live well, stay well 17What's changed most since your diagnosis? Acceptance and determination. First acceptance - I was relieved to know what was wrong, that I wasn't going mad and it wasn't 'the change'. Then determination for it not to stop me living life to the full. I wouldn't have managed this without Alzheimer's Society and their support workers. I don't mind having Alzheimer's and vascular dementia - it doesn't define who I am, it is just a part of me. What would you take to your desert island? A survival book, to keep me busy and alive. It would make the time fun rather than frightening. I don't like being on my own but, if I had to be, then I'd want to be busy . I'd eat, have shelter and warmth... and the fire would keep animals away! How has Alzheimer's Society helped you? They've been helpful in so many ways. If it hadn't been for them, I still wouldn't understand my diagnosis. They went into detail about how it could affect me, and what parts were from which condition. They've provided support for myself and all my loved ones, and we've been able to contact them any time for advice. They've supported me through depression, and my family though fear - they didn't know anything about dementia. If it hadn't been for them, my family would have crumbled. You're given a diagnosis and you're left, especially with young- onset dementia because it's all geared towards older people. In County Durham there's nothing for young-onset dementia. 3NDWG (the 3 Nations Dementia Working Group) has been brilliant too, and I'm trying to set up a young-onset dementia support group for County Durham, with help from Alzheimer's Society . What song or tune sums up your life so far? I Am What I Am, by Gloria Gaynor . It just says everything about my life. It doesn't matter what life deals me, I will adapt, overcome and survive - big, loud and proud! What single thing would improve your quality of life? The way medical personnel are trained in dementia. From diagnosis to medical review, the whole ship and shebang. Medical students get one day's training for dementia, but weeks for other things. Dementia has such a big impact, it's not right. For GPs, there really should be better training, as they're the first point of contact. Especially for young-onset dementia, where it's often confused with menopause, with depression, anxiety and stress, or put down to 'women's problems'. I had to fight for four years for my diagnosis. If you could go back in time, where would you go? I wouldn't. I like me and so I wouldn't go back in case I changed things. I might not be me anymore, or I might not have had my kids. I love my life and my family , I'm proud of my strengths and even my weaknesses. What is your most treasured possession? Apart from my loved ones, my photo albums. I've got pictures from when my grandmother was a child right up to last week. I've started adding text to them with names, dates and little things I remember like 'Uncle George's tickly 'tache'. Even if I can't remember people's names, I'll still be able to enjoy them. I've got nearly 100 years of photos to add text to! It's also a legacy for my kids.

Person living with dementia 21065-DemConnect_DemTogetherAD.indd 121065-DemConnect_DemTogetherAD.indd 1 28/06/2021 17:5428/06/2021 17:54alzheimers.org.uk/getsupport19I started working for Alzheimer's Society here in Guernsey in 2005. At that time, there was very little support on the island for people with dementia or their carers. As well as in Wales, England and Northern Ireland, the Society also works in two crown dependencies - Guernsey and the Isle of Man. A number of things in Guernsey are different compared to the UK. There's no NHS here, and costs can be a barrier to people getting a dementia diagnosis. At \u00a356 to visit the GP , some people think twice. Blood tests incur a charge, then there's another \u00a356 to return to the GP for the results. A short telephone consultation costs more than \u00a340. There's this idea that everyone in the Channel Islands is mega rich, and that's far from the truth! Surprising differences UK relatives of people living with dementia in Guernsey are often surprised by the differences here. Mental health legislation was only recently updated after decades, and we only just introduced lasting powers of attorney this year . There needs to be more investment in dementia care - high quality , person-centred care cannot be provided on a shoestring. Respite care is something that's very lacking here as well. Although people are entitled to four weeks' respite care each year , actually getting it when it suits them and being able to plan around it isn't easy . There are real problems in recruiting and retaining health and social care staff, especially with the dire shortage of affordable housing for them. I'd like to see action taken to address the lack of long-term care choices that are available to people, as well as the inequities in health and social care. More confident It's not all bad though. Waiting times are lower than in the UK, including for memory clinic appointments. When the pandemic hit, our small population and greater travel restrictions meant we only had two relatively short lockdowns, and we supported people with Companion Calls. People were more confident to return to normal activities sooner each time, and there was a high vaccination rate - we got to over 90% of people vaccinated very quickly . Even so, the social isolation as a result of the lockdowns did have a very negative impact on many people's wellbeing.Lovely people I support anyone affected by dementia - the person with the condition as well as carers, family or friends. Some come straight to us, and others are referred by other charities or adult services. I mostly support people one to one. I accompany people on their dementia journey , so they don't feel that they're alone. I provide information about strategies to cope with changes, and how to live as well as possible with the condition. We also run weekly activity and Singing for the Brain groups. I like to take time to really listen to people. Sometimes I might be the first person someone has opened up to about their dementia and how they're feeling, so how are you going to rush that? Why have I worked at the Society for so long? Well, you know you're doing something worthwhile and there's a lot of variety . You know you're making a difference, and it's working with a lot of lovely people - including a great team of volunteers!

Staff at T assee2ltd, a Vodafone partner with stores in Omagh, Newry , Coleraine and Enniskillen, were joined by friends and relatives to trek to the 850-metre summit of Slieve Donard in County Down. Stuart Roberts, Company Owner , said, 'I really enjoyed taking part in the event together with colleagues from our stores, our Digital Sales team and family and friends. 'We were lucky with the weather in what proved to be a challenging but enjoyable day in aid of a fantastic cause which is close to all our hearts. 'I'm really proud that our efforts will help Alzheimer's Society be there for more people affected by dementia and create a lasting change.' Linzi Stewart, Community Fundraiser at the Society , said, 'We are in awe of supporters like Stuart and his team, whose brilliant fundraising efforts enable us to reach more people through our vital support services. 'We are very grateful for their dedication to fundraising for Alzheimer's Society , which ensures that we are able to support those who need it most.'Two amazing supporters in Wales broke records this summer while raising almost \u00a33,000 for us in the Round Britain and Ireland yacht race. Lou Boorman from Pembrokeshire, aged 20, is the youngest skipper ever to take part in the event, while first mate Elin Jones from Wrexham became its youngest female competitor at 19. They sailed for 22 days on White Knight, having chosen to support Alzheimer's Society in memory of three grandparents who had dementia. The gruelling race is held every four years by the Royal Western Yacht Club in Plymouth. Competitors covered 1,800 nautical miles (over 3,300km), stopping at Galway in the west of Ireland, Lerwick in Shetland and Blyth in Northumberland before returning to Plymouth. Elin said, 'It took a few days to sink in that we'd done it and set a record. It felt like a fever dream. It was amazing. It was really good to do it with Lou too, we worked through things together . 'Sailing hasn't really been involved with dementia before and we hope that we can add another sport and community that can get behind it. We are honoured to have fundraised for you.' A proud 50th Alzheimer's Society was overjoyed to join Pride on its return to London in July . Over a million LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay , bisexual, trans, queer plus) people and allies marked the event's 50th anniversary after a two-year hiatus. The Society's stand provided dementia information and visibility at Trafalgar Square, where people celebrated following the parade. Barry Moss, Dementia Adviser , said, 'Members of the LBGTQ+ community can be reluctant to engage with health and social care because of previous treatment and prejudice. 'We understand the unique challenges faced by LGBTQ+ people on their dementia journeys, and when we say , \"We're here for everyone affected by dementia,\" we mean it. 'The atmosphere was infectious, and to see so many smiling faces and people engaging with our volunteers was amazing.' Louise Bates, Dementia Friendly Development Officer , added, 'Everyone who saw us was reminded that Alzheimer's Society is here for them should they ever need us. 'We had life-changing conversations - with sole carers who have never accessed support, with friends looking to support someone through diagnosis, and bringing a new perspective to past memories, giving back a little light that had been lost.' Scaling Donard Making history21Why dementia, why the Society? Over a number of years, I've watched my mum's dementia develop. I saw first-hand how difficult it was for her to get her diagnosis. I also saw that with knowledge came understanding and acceptance, and how small changes have made a big difference to Mum's day-to-day life. Alzheimer's Society puts people like my mother at the heart of everything we do, empowering people with dementia not just to shape, but to lead the change we all want to create in our world. How to fill an unexpected day off? I spend so much of my life surrounded by people and in a 'doing' mode. I might go for a nice walk along the Thames or , even better , drive to a beach. I was brought up minutes from the sea, and I am a great believer in the healing powers of water . Weather permitting, I would spend the time just sitting and being - allowing my thoughts to drift with the water and land as they wish. I then might take in a cheeky afternoon film and meet up with my partner and children for pizza in the evening. This sounds like bliss! Proudest achievement? Without a shadow of a doubt, it has to be adopting my two amazing children. Adoption is complicated, for those who are adopted and for adoptive parents, but it has been the greatest learning journey of my life. I am also proud of the kind of daughter , sister , aunt and friend that I am. I'm definitely not perfect, but I value these relationships and am willing to put in the emotional energy that it takes to form deep connections. Biggest priority for coming months? Leading my team to a place where we can seize opportunities from the greater integration of health and social care. We want to shape the most supportive local pathways for people affected by dementia, and design service models that increase accessibility and deliver great support. More personally , Mum is moving to the next stage on her dementia journey , and we are focused on finding her a wonderful place to live, where she can feel safe, loved and cared for . Similarly , my adult son with autism and learning disability is transitioning from living in a residential college into assisted living. T o be honest, this is all scary stuff!Most important thing learned from a person with dementia? I think the jewel learning for me has to be how very small moments are often the most significant and meaningful in life, and the importance of taking the time to listen beyond the words that people use. Most looking forward to? I am very excited about our 'Help and hope' five-year strategy . With the focus on collaboration and partnership, I believe we can be 'more than the sum of our parts'. We are already trusted partners in delivering services at a national and local level. I am looking forward to develop these relationships even further in co-designing and delivering integrated care to those who need us.Dara de Burca, Director of Operations Spotlight: Dara with her mum.22 Culture and community Photographs: ITV Cymru Wales23I see what support is available to others, and it's really sad that it's not there for Dad,' says Samia Egeh, whose father Ali was diagnosed with vascular dementia around 10 years ago. Ali grew up in Somaliland - an autonomous region of Somalia in the east of Africa - before moving to Cardiff as a teenager , where he still lives. He now prefers to communicate in the Somali language, but Samia says there are no local services that meet his cultural needs. This leaves him cut off from a community - as a part of which, he previously thrived. 'It would be nice if he could benefit from services,' says Samia. 'I think it's unfair that someone who has contributed and paid taxes now can't get anything back.' Samia is calling on those in power to listen to the voices of the communities they serve. 'They've been told over and over , reports have been done - I've taken part in so much stuff, it's exhausting. And we're still not being heard,' she says. 'This is a message for the Welsh Government to put money where their mouth is.' Loving and gentle Ali, now 83, first came to Wales to join a family member who was already in the country . 'My father was from a working class family - his father had quite a hard life,' says Samia. 'Dad came straight into work, washing dishes in restaurants. He had many different jobs, hard jobs, like working in a steelworks.' Ali went to college but not university , as he felt that supporting his family should be the priority . 'He knew they had it tough, so he wanted to help them financially ,' says Samia. 'He used to get paid \u00a321 and told me that he spent seven, saved seven and gave seven to his family .' Samia, who is one of four siblings, describes her father as hardworking, loving and gentle. 'He didn't want us to go through what he went through, so he made sure we had a good life,' she says. A proud man who always liked to look smart, Ali loved walking and nature, as well as playing cards and doing crosswords. He was also very connected to his community and wanted his children to experience a balance of Somali, Welsh and British culture. 'He always promoted us being respectful citizens,' says Samia. 'He really believed in his family , and we're very proud of him.' Losing confidence Around 10 years ago, Ali had two strokes. This led to a CT brain scan and visit from the memory service, and a diagnosis of vascular dementia.Samia Egeh says that a lack of specialist services has left her father cut off from his community. Gareth Bracken speaks to a daughter urging for more to be done. Culture and community 'Quick read Samia Egeh in Cardiff is frustrated at a lack of culturally appropriate services for her father Ali, who has vascular dementia. Ali, now 83, came to Wales from Somaliland as a teenager , and around 10 years ago had two strokes. Ali now prefers to communicate in Somali but has become socially isolated as no dementia services can meet his cultural needs. Samia would like to see a culturally tailored memory caf\u00e9 and is calling on the Welsh Government to fund specialist services. 24 'We'd realised he was getting forgetful, and starting to lose confidence,' says Samia. 'He had always been an outgoing, bubbly person but he started not wanting to see people, because he was embarrassed at forgetting them. 'At first we all just carried on. We were quite ignorant ourselves and didn't know much about dementia or how to deal with it, so we didn't.' Following Ali's diagnosis, Samia improved her understanding of the condition. 'I went on training and even changed jobs to work with older people,' she says. 'I wanted to try and make sure my father had a better quality of life.' However , Samia hasn't been impressed with some of the professional support that Ali and the family have been offered. 'A dementia nurse visited for his medication. That was one visit and then never seen again, which I was quite shocked about,' she says. A package of care, including home visits, was suggested for Ali, but Samia felt that these visits were too short to be of any real benefit to her father . 'He has cultural and religious needs to be met, and certain home comforts that are very crucial, so they would need to be longer visits, even if they weren't as often,' she says. Specialist services Samia is also upset that a lack of culturally appropriate local services has left Ali socially isolated. 'Dad used to really enjoy seeing his friends and people in the community , or even just listening to people speak about what's going on in the community ,' she says. 'He wants to speak Somali and speak about his childhood memories, but there are no tailored services that meet his needs.' This lack of social stimulation and cultural connection has had a negative impact on the whole family . 'It's affected Dad physically and mentally , and means he'll go downhill faster ,' says Samia. 'It's really sad and upsetting that he doesn't go out, and the family don't get any respite either .' Samia feels that much more could be done to improve the situation, by developing specialist services. 'I'd like to see a memory caf\u00e9 with different activities. You could have a luncheon club or do intergenerational work with schools. You could have specialists come in to give tips about food or eating, to help make sure that people's wellness is there. 'Once you build relationships, you can see what the people enjoy and what their needs are. It could even be under the same roof as existing services. 'It would benefit Dad physically , mentally and emotionally . He'd be seeing people and would be happier , with a better quality of life.' See www.bristoldementiawellbeing.org for Bristol Dementia Wellbeing Service's Somali-language film about dementia, produced with the local Somali community. Photograph: ITV Cymru Wales25Reach everybody Samia believes that more should be done to support people like her father . 'Why are people from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic communities being treated differently? We've got the same rights as everybody else. Why don't they come out and reach us?' she says. 'There's a lack of understanding and awareness. Someone like Dad is not recognised or represented - he's totally ignored. Obviously they don't care. I'm quite disgusted, to be honest.' It isn't only her father who Samia is concerned about, but also others who may be in a similar or worse situation. 'I'm sure we're not an isolated case,' she says. 'Mum helps him, and we support him - we've got a system. But what about those who aren't in such a favourable place? I really worry for them. 'At some point dementia is going to affect us all. I want to raise awareness and ensure that the message reaches everybody .' And whether it's in her professional or personal life, Samia will continue to advocate for older people. 'They've done so much,' she says. 'If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't be who we are.'

NHS England has established 42 integrated care systems - partnerships between the NHS, local authorities, voluntary organisations and others - to improve the lives of people in their area, including those affected by dementia. In Northamptonshire, the launch of the Northamptonshire Integrated Care System (NICS) has formalised some existing arrangements while simplifying how organisations work together and make decisions. Alzheimer's Society is part of a large team of organisations and services that are working together to help people stay well, independent and at home for longer . Happy and healthy Giles West, a deputy director at Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, has been leading on establishing the new approach. 'Listening to the experiences of our older people, the greatest gap was the failure to consider the holistic needs of the person and their carers, to understand what mattered to them and what they wanted to achieve,' he says. As part of the integrated care system, groups that offer peer and professional support free of charge have been launched. More of the time of GPs, pharmacists, specialist nurses and others has also been freed up to support people affected by dementia. Each area of Northamptonshire has a designated Age Well team, made up of professionals with different areas of expertise, including dementia support workers from Alzheimer's Society . Services such as befriending and a memory hub that offers activities are also available. 'We focused on how we could help our older population feel happy , healthy , and able to maintain their independence, by bringing staff from across different organisations to work collectively for the person,' says Giles. 'We will continue to listen, adapt and innovate, to help people live their best lives as they age.' Support and strategies Being part of NICS has allowed the Society to support people who wouldn't have contacted us previously , explains Diane Better together Health and care services are working in new partnerships to improve support for people affected by dementia. Gareth Bracken explores the benefits of this approach in Northamptonshire. Quick read Health and care services in England are working in new partnerships to improve support for people affected by dementia. One of these integrated care systems is in Northamptonshire, where Alzheimer's Society works with others to provide better support. Suzanne Whatling, Dementia Support Worker , liaises with other organisations to decide who is best placed to support a particular person. Angela Locicero, whose dad has dementia, received helpful advice and support from the Society after being referred by Age UK.For personalised information and advice, call our Dementia Connect support line on 0333 150 3456, or for Welsh speakers call 03300 947 400. Giles West27Jenkins, our Dementia Connect Local Services Manager for Northamptonshire. 'Dementia support from Alzheimer's Society in Northamptonshire has been minimal over the last few years, and this new way of integrated working is now embedding dementia support in the heart of services,' she says. 'This means more people have the opportunity to receive dementia support, information and advice than ever before.' The outcomes so far have been positive. 'We're increasing dementia awareness and knowledge in GP practices, which is good for people pre- and post-diagnosis, and we're giving people support and strategies to prevent further escalation,' she says. Best outcomes So how does this Society support work in practice? Suzanne Whatling is a Dementia Support Worker who operates as a link worker in one of the Age Well teams. 'People with dementia are referred to us from all angles - the GP , a district nursing team, a social prescribing service,' she explains. Suzanne provides both remote and face-to-face support, including joint visits with other professionals from the Age Well team. This can cover anything from assessments for minor equipment in the home to questions about respite care and end of life. 'I visited a carer a couple of weeks ago to support with strategies for coping with a person's incontinence,' she says. 'I've managed to get another person with dementia into a community group, and am trying to organise a befriending visit for him.' Suzanne is also involved when a person with dementia has their case reviewed, to try and stop them declining and having to go into hospital. 'I'll be there with the likes of Age UK, Northamptonshire Carers, and the adult social services team, and we'll agree which of us is best placed to support,' she says. For Suzanne, the collaboration with other organisations has been very positive. 'I was at a local authority for 25 years and joint working was very poor , but this is at the forefront and is amazing to be part of,' she says. 'Previously , the physical side of things could get disregarded because someone has dementia, but now we're working holistically . 'People want to do it and want to achieve the best outcomes for their patients.' Full extent Angela Locicero received support from Age UK about daycare options for her dad, who was diagnosed with dementia in 2014. They also referred her to the Society , to see what other support could be offered, and the family was visited by Charlotte Murray , Dementia Support Worker . 'Charlotte came to Dad's home and gave us good insight about dementia,' says Angela. 'She went through behaviour changes, how to keep him safe, and advice about eating and swallowing. Things that we didn't really know, even after eight years. 'It's good to know the full extent of what can happen later down the line, then we can help Dad the best we can.' Angela was impressed with the joined-up working and support that this approach was able to provide. 'It all linked together quite nicely ,' she says. 'It's just a very good service.'

Our shared ambition was to make London the first dementia-friendly capital city in the world. This includes making sure that people affected by dementia can access all that the capital has to offer . Last May , in partnership with the Society , the Mayor launched the world's first Dementia Friendly Venues Charter for cultural public venues at the Museum of London. T aking action The Dementia Friendly Venues Charter was developed through consultation with people affected by dementia as well as a range of arts and cultural organisations - museums, theatres, galleries, libraries and others. The charter sets out the kinds of things that make a venue more accessible for people with dementia and anyone supporting them. This can include sensory tours, inclusive performances and relaxed sessions, clear signage, designated chill out zones and staff training. 'Organisations are now taking practical action to transform cultural venues for people living with dementia and their carers,' says Justine Simons, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries. 'Since its launch, 120 venues have signed up to the charter , to ensure those living with dementia can make the most of the city's cultural attractions, including City Hall, Hackney Empire and William Morris Gallery .' T o share what's worked the best and inspire new ideas, organisations signing up to the charter also become part of a Dementia Friendly Arts and Culture Network, led by the Museum of London. They can access guidance, materials, advice and support from Alzheimer's Society too. We've also helped develop an accreditation process to recognise achievements and maintain standards. 'Dementia-friendly arts and cultural venues are crucial to ensuring people affected by dementia can still explore and enjoy a range of experiences across London,' says Hannah Ward, Regional Public Affairs and Campaigns Officer at the Society . 'By signing up to the charter , Just the ticket Arts and cultural venues in London are committing to becoming more dementia friendly. Gareth Bracken reports on making cultural life more accessible. Quick read Cultural venues across London are committing to becoming more accessible by signing up to the Dementia Friendly Venues charter . Launched by the Mayor of London and Alzheimer's Society, the charter outlines how venues can become more dementia friendly. The Museum of London has improved its signage and trained staff and volunteers to better understand dementia. Ronald Amanze, who has vascular dementia, would like to see the charter replicated across the country. See www.london.gov.uk/dfvc for more about the Dementia Friendly Venues Charter . Photographs: Museum of London29venues are showing a commitment to making their exhibitions, events and activities accessible for all.' Safe and comfortable Seiwa Cunningham is Programme Manager for Memories of London - a programme of events and activities for people with dementia. It's delivered by the Museum of London, one of the venues accredited by the charter . 'We want people to be able to access our space knowing that it's safe and comfortable,' says Seiwa. 'We've improved our signage, and our staff and volunteers wear Dementia Friends badges. We can turn down audio-visual elements for people with dementia, and we're trying to create a dementia-friendly time slot and develop quiet spaces.' The museum's staff and volunteers also complete regular training to maintain their skills and awareness. 'It's important our staff know that dementia can bring out unexpected behaviour in a person,' says Seiwa. 'So, if that happens, they're not surprised and are confident to assist people.' During the pandemic, the Museum of London developed an online programme, including creative exercises and a live singalong. Seiwa has now decided to reinstate these. 'It's actually something quite crucial within the charter - you need to keep creating online content,' she says. 'People shouldn't be denied engagement just because they can't get out.' Seiwa hopes that the museum's work, and the charter in general, will help to raise awareness of dementia and its impact on people's lives. 'A lot of people think it's just a cognitive condition - that's the be all and end all. But there's a lot of other issues, like mobility and heightened sensory needs,' she says. 'When people campaign about an issue, it's often something that they've come to because they've been affected by it. We have to make it so that you don't have to be affected by dementia before you think of people who are.'More sensitive Ronald Amanze, who lives with vascular dementia, welcomes the charter , which he would like to see replicated across the country . 'I think dementia-friendly cultural venues are very important,' he says. 'Art has been the vehicle that enables me to communicate. When I get tangled with my words and can't express myself, I tend to communicate my feelings in poems. 'But I've had experiences in libraries where it was very difficult and unpleasant. Many of the problems were down to them not understanding me. People would perceive me as a problem, but they should have been more sensitive that my behaviour might have been down to health issues.' Ronald recently appeared in a film at the Museum of London Docklands, which detailed how the venue seeks to be accessible for people living with dementia. 'I have been working for a while now with Alzheimer's Society , Deepness Dementia Radio and other organisations to ensure that the rich cultural diversity of the UK is represented in planning and resources for people with dementia,' he says. 'This is particularly important for London, which is recognised as not only a key cultural platform in the world but also one of the most culturally diverse cities.'

Try something new Got something to say?32We visited a group of people living with dementia in Wakefield that meets regularly to discuss topics and share their opinions. The group heard about My Life TV , a streaming service that's been specially designed for people with dementia, and talked about what they like to watch on TV . Then they tried out some virtual reality (VR) viewers to immerse themselves in reminiscence films from The Wayback. My Life TV and The Wayback are both available through our online shop at shop.alzheimers.org.uk My Life TV My Life TV is a video on demand service that's been created for people with dementia to feel stimulated and connected to the world. It offers a mix of programmes for reminiscence, as well as a range of other interactive content. This includes specially created quizzes, chair exercises, poetry and Singing for the Brain sessions. There are no ads, and you can watch it on a smart TV , computer or mobile device for \u00a33.99 a month, which you can cancel at any time. After hearing about My Life TV , the group discussed their favourite types of television programmes. T ed said, 'I enjoy watching old films about the 60s, especially in London where I worked then. The old films like The Lavender Hill Mob - I don't want the violence that you get these days. 'I enjoy looking, seeing no cars parked on the street and that sort of thing. London used to empty at the weekend. My wife was pregnant at the time and we used to go to Regents Park - it's nice to reminisce.' Ian said, 'I watch motor sports, the news, documentaries. Soaps definitely not! They're so unreal, I gave up on those years ago.' Keith said he's enjoying a documentary presented by Brian Cox about the universe at the moment. He said, 'I like history a lot, programmes where they're going back through wars, going to places where things that happened in the war were notable.' Claire, from our online shop, said, 'I think you'll be delighted by My Life TV when you have a go!' The Wayback The Wayback have produced 360\u00b0 films of the Queen's coronation in 1953 and England's 1966 World Cup victory . Using a viewer attached to a smartphone, you can feel completely immersed in these events, looking wherever you want to explore. Consumer panel People with dementia try out some immersive virtual reality films and tell us what they'd like from a TV service. Reminiscence films33 With each film, there are different sections that place you in the middle of what's going on. For example, the coronation film features scenes in a living room and kitchen before heading out to a street party . Using the viewer , Keith said, 'If I look up I can see the sky , and over there I can see a bloke cleaning a car! Up that way , there's a whole body of people at a long table on the street.' When Sandra looked around the coronation scenes, she was immediately prompted to share her own memories of that time. Ian, who has a great deal of video production experience himself, said, 'It's a great mechanism to stimulate your brain and help you to recall history . 'That's very useful, and very often going over memories can be quite helpful in affecting and impacting mood.' The group agreed that it would usually be best for someone to set it up for the person with dementia beforehand. This involves downloading an app and films onto a smartphone, and constructing the viewer from a fold-out piece of card. But once this is done, it's simply a matter of looking through it. Josie said, 'It's like looking at old photos,' and several other group members added, 'But better!' We've arranged a special package with The Wayback that provides unlimited access to coronation and World Cup films for \u00a364.99, including a free viewer , with 20% donated to the Society .

Caroline Branney , who manages our Dementia Knowledge Centre, says, 'On this occasion, Montefiore has chosen to base her story around a woman in her 60s who runs a village shop in rural England. 'We gradually get to know Marigold, her family and friends. Montefiore introduces them and their lives in a natural but absorbing way , so that we can imagine what life must be like for them. 'There are various subplots about her daughters and other members of the community . These include romance and amusing stories about pets, gossip and neighbours.' Ann Bird in West Midland says, 'This book is a wonderful read, I could not put it down. It's very poignant.' Health worries Caroline says, 'Slowly , the author introduces Marigold and her lifestyle, then her memory lapses, tiredness and confusion. 'At first Marigold keeps her health problems and worries to herself, but we are party to some particular incidents which signal that possibly there is something seriously wrong. 'At the same time, we empathise with her and her circle of friends and family as they too become aware that Marigold has difficulties.' Ann says, 'The characters come to life on every page - I laughed and cried with them and felt all their emotions. 'It was lovely to see it from all sides and how they came together on this journey .' Refreshing ideas Caroline says, 'Without giving too much of the plot away , the story is entertaining but also provides refreshing ideas about taking opportunities, appreciating people and family relationships. 'I think the portrayal of dementia and how it affects individuals and communities is realistic overall, covering topics such as denial, stigma, diagnosis, support and conflicting priorities. 'When one of Marigold's daughters states that dementia isn't a disease - which is true of dementia in itself - part of me wanted the book to go on to explain that dementia is caused by diseases that affect the brain. However , it is a novel and not a factsheet, I suppose! 'We learn how adult daughters might feel about a parent who needs extra attention and may not be able to continue in their care-giving role. We understand more about how a partner of someone with dementia might feel when faced with a changing relationship, and of course we also find out how Marigold herself responds and reacts to her changing situation. 'There is plenty of humour as well as some sadness and reflection on life and on taking the kind of decisions which will be familiar to anyone with lived experience.' Ann sums up, 'It's a must-read.' Enduring love Caroline says, 'Whether this is a typical account of what can happen is up to the reader to decide. Based on my knowledge, many of the descriptions and events seem feasible. 'I think the most important message is that everyone is different, and everyone with dementia is also different. So, although Marigold reacts in a certain way , this will not be the case for everyone. 'Montefiore says that, above all, the book is \"about enduring love, the kind of love that survives whatever obstacles are put in its way\". 'Certainly , this novel conjures up a lovely family and community so that we warm to many of the characters, particularly to Marigold, who is such a popular and well-loved part of their lives.'

They're also more likely to get dementia at a younger age. However , the right support can help people with learning disabilities to live well with dementia too. Different ways Just as dementia affects people in different ways, so does having a learning disability . The type of care and support that your uncle needs will depend on how both these conditions affect him - now and in the future. If your uncle has a very mild learning disability , you might find that the support he needs is not that different to that needed by anyone who has dementia. If his learning disability has more of an impact on his day- to-day life, you'll already have strategies or approaches that you use to support him. As his dementia develops, you'll need to find ways to adapt these. Activities and routines Your uncle will have his own ways of communicating and carrying out daily tasks and activities. Try to support him to continue doing these as long as possible. Perhaps he likes to make his own meals but can't now remember every step. Can he still do it with someone else's help, or by referring to a clear list of steps? With the right support and adaptations in place, your uncle could carry on doing many things that he enjoys. Routines are often important for people with dementia as well as people with learning disabilities. Creating or keeping familiar , regular routines could be helpful, though be flexible about adapting these when necessary . Understanding It may help to tell the people around your uncle about how he prefers to communicate, and that he might have difficulties with certain things. Any memory problems will get worse as his dementia progresses, and he might need longer to process and understand what is being said. He may also begin to have incorrect beliefs about people or situations, or begin to do things that are out of character . Continued change It's important to keep checking for any changes in your uncle's health, behaviour or daily living skills. This is because the support your uncle needs will change as his dementia progresses. Some people with learning disabilities find that their dementia gets worse more quickly than it would for other people. However , this can also be because people with learning disabilities are often diagnosed later , when their dementia is more advanced.Learning disability'My uncle has a learning disability and I support him when he needs it.

However , even in the later stage of dementia, sensory activities could be a good way to make a connection with someone. Our sense of smell can be very powerful. As well as bringing pleasure, some smells, like lavender , may help to soothe symptoms of dementia, such as sleeplessness and agitation. Evocative smells Scent can also be very evocative and a great tool for reminiscence, especially if you find smells that have a particular meaning for that person. These could relate to their upbringing or social life, like cooking aromas or someone's perfume. They could be natural smells like a plant that grew nearby , or smells from local industries - for example, of farmyards or breweries. Think about what they did at work and in their free time. If they did carpentry , the smell of sawdust may have strong associations for them. Scents can also remind the person of holidays and happy occasions. For someone who enjoyed religious ceremonies, the smell of incense might be soothing. Home and away Perhaps you could take the person to visit places to enjoy the smells there. If they liked gardening, take them to a community garden. Or , if certain cooking smells remind them of home, try a restaurant or market stall where that food is made. There may also be ways to bring smells to the person. Scented flowers or herb pots are a great way of bringing natural smells indoors. There are also kits that use scent for reminiscence.

I know some are for kids but it requires very little dexterity to dip a brush and cover the surface, which reveals a pretty picture. 'There are a lot of sets available to buy and some aren't very suitable for adults, but there are some companies which make reusable sets designed for people with dementia. 'I bought a set called \"classic vehicles\". It just has an outline and you \"colour it in\" with water and it reveals a classic car , bus, plane etc. I bought a bunch online and sent to the residential home to use for an activity . 'Dad didn't used to paint, but he's not good with anything fiddly , and he did used to like making things, so it seemed a good idea.' WJG adds, 'Play music! I lost my interest in art (probably because of atrophy to my parietal lobes) and got it back through listening to the music of my youth - the Beatles and the Stones.'

Ask to be shown around - I asked if I could just sit in the lounge where the residents were, to get an idea of what it is like. 'I described my mother's routine and general needs and behaviours, and asked the manager how her needs would be met. 'I asked what activities would be available and how they actively encourage participation. 'I asked to see the menus available and how flexible they are to meeting my mother's cultural and dietary needs. 'During my visit, I spoke to some of the carers. 'Visiting her regularly reassured her that I wasn't abandoning her , and also helped keep an eye on how she was.' Rehana 'If it's with a care home, make unannounced visits, describe your loved one on a bad day and let the home know about any special diet. Ask about activities and notice how staff and residents interact. 'If you've chosen a home, arrange your loved one's room in the way that you think they would like it. Try to get them in for a few visits first, use \"love lies\" when you need to, be very discreet - do not say goodbye and the home will distract your loved one.' MaNaAk 'When I first left her , I snuck off. I rang the day after to check she was fine. I was going to see her and was told you can but try not to, as it's respite for you not her , so I stayed away . 'I visit when I can - she's safe, she's well and she's being looked after .' Fusilier274 'Book the respite before you book your own holiday or event. I found it almost impossible to find respite that was bookable.' Jessbow 'Consider day respite too. We paid for Mummy to go to a care home during the day a few days a week to give my dad a break. 'We had to pay for this, as the council won't fund and there was no suitable day care option locally . Daddy got a break and Mummy was able to get to know the staff at the care home she eventually became a full-time resident at. 'Not all homes are familiar with this, but they will usually do it, as it is money for them and they don't necessarily need a room if the person with dementia attends during the day only .' Helly68 'What I find useful is to take any breaks from my wife as respite. When she sleeps for few hours, I sit down and relax. 'Right now, she has been in her room for two hours and it's a respite for me. Whenever one of our children comes for an afternoon, I go out and enjoy myself.
