Myofascial Release \"I went to see Laraba following a recommendation from my GP after two major ankle surgeries. I had several scars, including a very deep one on my calf muscle, and various aches and pains from almost two years on and off crutches, as well as physio and mobility issues. Laraba's Myofascial Release Therapy was a lifesaver. It helped minimize the scarring and balance the rest of my body -- something I didn't think possible before. Thank you!\" - K :: Lawyer \"Laraba's treatment has made a huge difference to a very painful knee. Due to an old skiing injury my knee stability is weak, so I do a lot of cycling. This has caused my hamstring to be very tight, and it's difficult to straighten my leg. In just one session, Laraba's Myofascial Release treatment has given me unbelievable movement and reduced the pain.\" - L :: Teacher \"Laraba has magic hands and an amazing ability to work on injuries you have long forgotten about that still give you grief. The work she has done on my fascia has been beneficial, both physically and mentally / emotionally. The release, in all senses, that Myofascial Release Therapy brings is worth experiencing.\" - C :: Coldwater Swimmer \"Since 2013, I have been benefitting, physiologically and psychologically, from Laraba's therapies. Her caring and friendly demeanour is authentic, and her knowledge of the of the mind-body connection, and the many techniques to apply, have resulted in a shifts towards healing and well-being.

Highly recommended!\" - R :: Clothing Designer \"I feel very fortunate to have been referred to Laraba about 10 years ago, when I had severe neck and shoulder issues due to accidents. She is very thorough, investigating and treating other areas of my body that were also causing my pain.

I continue to have treatments to help maintain my suppleness - and because it feels great!\" - B :: Counselling Psychologist \"I'm an avid athlete who finds peace through movement and who often pushes her body to its limits with a variety of sports. Laraba has been on my recovery team for more than 5 years. She puts her heart into her work and does a fantastic job with muscle recovery and pain. She's also helped me recover from various injuries with her targeted joint, fascia and muscle work. I can't recommend her highly enough.

Working with Laraba is an investment in yourself -- and your self will thank you!\" - R :: Entrepreneur \"I have been consulting Laraba for issues related to lower-back pain and a probable pectoral tear.

Thank you, Laraba!\" - D :: Manager, Geneva-based international organization \"I have been a client of Laraba's for a relatively short time but can highly recommend her as a very professional and knowledgeable therapist.
