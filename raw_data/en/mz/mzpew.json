Osteo Awesome to powerfully replenish the nutrients that aging and developing bones need!* Did you know that our bones are completely replaced every 10 years? Insane, right? Our bodies work in amazing ways! Over time, the older tissue is removed and replaced with new tissue to keep our bones fresh and strong. By the time we hit our late thirties, though, more bone tissue is being removed than regenerated, so they slowly weaken and become more fragile. It takes a surplus of nutrients to remodel the infrastructure of our bodies. Therefore, it takes a bone health supplement that's rich in bone-building nutrients like [calcium](https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product-category/vitamins-and-minerals/calcium/) to help preserve substantial bone regeneration. This is where Lively Vitamin Co. Osteo Awesome shines \u2014 it is loaded with the best minerals and vitamins for bone strength and durability! Here's what makes up this awesome blend of nutrients: - Calcium is crucial to bone structure, and we need plenty of it!

This dynamic duo allows for better absorption of calcium into the bloodstream.* - Vitamin K2 (MK-4), like vitamin D3, increases the absorption of calcium. Plus, it's one of the top [vitamins for bone strength](https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product-category/health-concerns/bone-health-supplements/)as it encourages healthy bone metabolism and helps calcium bind to bones for effective regeneration.* - Melatonin is an antioxidant that improves your sleep and your skeleton! Research studies have a lot to say about melatonin for bone health: less bone resorption (loss of bone mass), increased bone mass, greater collagen production, and stronger cartilage.* - Boron assists in maintaining healthy calcium levels and bone mineral density by increasing free testosterone within the body.* - Silica is another powerful nutrient that makes this one of the best supplements for bone strength as it encourages the natural production of bone cells.* - Strontium citrate reinforces bone health for individuals that may experience frequent breaks and bone weakness. It's an easily absorbed nutrient that also helps slow the degeneration of bones with age.* - Magnesium glycinate works in tandem with calcium to maintain strength and durability for long-lasting bone health!* There are plenty of supplements for healthy bones on the market, so what makes Osteo Awesome the best?
