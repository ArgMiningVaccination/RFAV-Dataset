The first issue of Aerospace Medicine and Biology was published in July 1964. Accession numbers cited in this issue are: STAR (N-10000 Series) N91 -15123 - N91-16987 IAA (A-10000 Series) ' A91-20489 - A91-24168 In its subject coverage, Aerospace Medicine and Biology concentrates on the biological, physiological, psychological, and environmental effects to which humans are subjected during and following simu- lated or actual flight in the Earth's atmosphere or in interplanetary space. References describing similar effects on biological organisms of lower order are also included. Such related topics as sanitary problems, pharmacology, toxicology, safety and survival, life support systems, exobiology, and person- nel factors receive appropriate attention. Applied research receives the most emphasis, but references to fundamental studies and theoretical principles related to experimental development also qualify for inclusion. Each entry in the publication consists of a standard bibliographic citation accompanied in most cases by an abstract. The listing of the entries is arranged by STAR categories 5,1 through 55, the Life, Sciences division. The citations include the original accession numbers from the respective announce- ment journals. Seven indexes\u2014subject, personal author, corporate source, foreign technology, contract, report number, and accession number\u2014are included. A cumulative index for 1991 will be published in early 1992. information on availability of documents listed, addresses of organizations, and NTIS price schedules are located at the back of this issue.TABLE OF CONTENTS Page Category 51 Life Sciences (General) 77 Category 52 Aerospace Medicine 82 Includes physiological factors; biological effects of radiation; and effects of weightlessness on man and animals.

Of particular interest is the possibility that a subject may be able to ignore an inaccurate sensory modality in favor of one or more other sensory modalities which do provide accurate orientation reference information. This process is referred as sensory selection. This proposal will attempt to quantify subject's sensory selection abilities and determine if this ability confers some immunity to the development of motion sickness symptoms.

Research supported by CNES and DRET. refs Copyright The applicability of the rat tail suspension model to studies of the effect of spaceflight on rat bone cells was investigated by comparing the histomorphometric effects of a 7-day male rats with those of 7-day-long tail suspension. The rats were injected with demethylchtortetracycline on the first day o1 experiments to label the calcifying tissues. Results of macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the rat tibiae indicated that the mechanism of bone loss due to microgravity in space are not entirely identical to that due to tail suspension on earth.

Research supported by SRON. refs Copyright Epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces rapid rounding of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. This process is dependent upon temperature and EGF concentration. To investigate the possible influence of gravity variations on EGF-induced cell rounding of A431 cells, experiments were performed using a fast-rotating clinostat and centrifuge, thereby simulating microgravity and higher gravity values, respectively. It was demonstrated that simulated microgravity conditions enhance EGF-induced cell rounding significantly, whereas hypergravity values do not show significant effects on this process. These results suggest that simulated microgravity modulates growth factor-induced signal transduction.

Research supported by SRON. refs CopyrightEpidermal growth factor (EGF) activates a well characterized signal transduction system in human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, which leads to rapid and transient expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene. In order to investigate the influence of altered gravity on EGF-induced signal transduction, the EGF-induced c-fos expression was studied under simulated hypo- and hypergravity conditions. In this report, it is shown that EGF-induced fos expression is decreased under simulated hypogravity conditions, while hypergravity has a stimulatory effect on EGF-induced fos expression. These results show that the EGF-activated signal transduction system is influenced by gravity, and that gravity exerts its effects already in the early phases of the signal transduction cascade.

Research supported by NAF. refs Copyright' Inotropic and chronotropic responses to the beta-agonist, isoprenaline (ISO) were studied with a transducer located in the left ventricle and a catheter placed in the left femoral artery in anesthesized rats at 1 and 30 bar. The hemodynamic control values were equal in both series. During ISO infusion, the chronotropy increased equally (34 percent) at 1 and 30 bar.. The inotropy increased by 38 percent during ISO infusion at 1 bar. Increased inotropy (44 percent), and unchanged chronotropy were found during compression to 30 bar. The ISO evoked inotropic responses in absolute values were greater at 30 bar than at 1 bar. Nevertheless, an equal relative increase in inotropy was found during ISO infusion at 30 bar compared to 1 bar. The cardiac oxygen consumption was estimated to be 65 percent higher at 30 bar during ISO infusion compared to that at 1 bar. Author- A91-20558 ALTERED BAROREFLEX FUNCTION AFTER TAIL SUSPENSION IN THE CONSCIOUS RAT BARBARA L. BRIZZEE (Tulane University, New Orleans, LA) and BENJIMEN R. WALKER (New Mexico, University, Albuquerque) Journal of Applied Physiology (ISSN 0161-7567), vol. 69, Dec. 1990, p. 2091-2096. refs (Contract NIH-HL-42778) Copyright The effect of simulated weightlessness on the baroreceptor reflex (BRR) sensitivity was investigated using chronically instrumented rats subjected to tail suspension (1 week of 30-deg head-down tilt). The BRR sensitivity was assessed by administration of a series of intravenous bolus doses of phenylephrine (0.50, 0.75, 1.25, 2.00, and 2.50 microgram/kg). In addition, the effect of intravenous administration of a specific antagonist to V2-vasopressinergic receptors, d(CH2)5(D-lle2, Ile4)-arginine vasopressin, on the BRR sensitivity was examined. It was found that BRR sensitivity decreased significantly on day 7 of tail suspension. However, the BRR sensitivity was not significantly altered by the administration of the V2 antagonist either before tail suspension or after the release.

TISCHLER (Arizona, University, Tucson) Journal of Applied Physiology (ISSN 0161-7567), vol. 69, Dec. 1990, p. 2113-2119. refs (Contract NAG2-384; NIH-RR-05675) Copyright The effect of unweighting on the response of the soleus- muscle carbohydrate metabolism to a beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol) was investigated in rats that were subjected to three days of tail-cast suspension. It was found that isoproterenol promoted glycogen degradation in soleus from suspended rats to a higher degree than in weighted soleus from control rats, and had no effect in unweighted digitorum longus. However, isoproterenol did not have a greater inhibitory effect on the net uptake of tritium-labeled 2-deoxy-glucose by the unweighted soleus and that isoproterenol inhibited hexose phosphorylation less in the unweighted than in the control muscle.

Research supported by the Southern Regional Education Board. refs (Contract NAG2-386; NASA ORDER A-21996-C) Copyright The effects of a 7-day spaceflight (SF), 7- and 14-day-long whole body suspension (WBS), and 7-day-long recovery on the muscle weight and the morphology of the soleus and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) of rats were investigated. It was found that the effect of 7-day-long SF and WBS were highly comparable for both the soleus and the EDL, although the soleus muscle from SF rats showed greater cross-sectional area reduction than that from WBS rats. With a longer duration of WBS, there was a continued reduction in cross-sectional fast-twitch fiber area. Muscle plasticity, in terms of fiber and capillary responses, showed differences in responses of the two types of muscles, indicating that antigravity posture muscles are highly susceptible to unloading.

A NONLINEAR MODEL OF THE PHASIC DYNAMICS OF MUSCLE ACTIVATION BLAKE HANNAFORD (Washington, University, Seattle) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering (ISSN 0018-9294), vol. 37, Nov. 1990, p. 1067-1075. Research supported by NASA, refs ^ Copyright A phasic excitation-activation (PEXA) model is presented of the process of motoneuron excitation and the resultant activation and force development of a motor unit. The model input is an amount of depolarizing current (as when injected with an intracellular electrode), and the model output is muscle force. The model includes dynamics and nonlinearities similar to phenomena discovered experimentally by others: the firing rate response of motoneurons to steps of depolarizing current and the catch-like enhancement of force produced by overlapping motor neuron action potentials. The parameter values used in this model are derived from experimentally measured data and are expressed in physical units. Model predictions extend to published data beyond those used in generating the model parameter values. I.E. A91-22050 MECHANISMS OF SIMULTANEOUS INCREASE OF HEAT AND COLD RESISTANCE IN RATS [O MEKHANIZMAKH ODNOVREMENNOGO Aug. 1990, p. 1078-1083. In Russian, refs Copyright The effect of daily exposures of rats adapted to warm (daily periods of 4 h at 38 C) and cold (80-min periods at -4 C), environments to alternating periods of warm (38 C, 4 hr) and cold (-7 C to 2 C, 16 hr) environments on the resistance of these animals to cold and heat was investigated. It was found that, in rats preadapted to a warm environment, three months of warm-cold treatment resulted in increased resistance to both cold and heat; this was due to an increased heat exchange through evaporative salivation and heat generation. The thermogenesis of these rats was higher than that of rats adapted to a cold environment. This is considered to be due to a smaller influence of thyroid glands in heat-adapted rats, compared to cold-adapted rats, and to an increased role of the sympatho-adrenal system. I.S. A91-22105 ULTRASTRUCTURE OF p. In Russian, refs Copyright This monograph discusses the nature of adaptive subcellular structural changes that occurred in liver cells of mice of three genetic types in response to mechanical stress (violent shaking) of different intensity, rhythm, and duration. Consideration is also given to changes caused in liver cellular organelles by injections of 'adaptive' hormones, such as glucagon, adrenaline, and hydrocortisone, and to the effect of acute stress on the structural changes of liver cells caused by injections of CCI4. Particular attention is given to the influence of the genetic background on the adaptive response of the animal's liver cells to a CCI4 injection. I.S.

Experiments with small animals have been conducted concerning these changes in the Cosmos series space missions. The increase of corticosterone in plasma is followed by the activation of enzymes involved in the amino-acid metabolism in rat livers. After a 2-6-day recovery period, the plasma corticosterone concentration and the level of liver enzymes returned to control levels. O.C.

A water immersion facility for simulated weightlesness was employed, with a control room to simulate the payload operational control center. The effects of reduced laboratory facilities, delay of communication between researchers and operators, and of several experiments being performed simultaneously by a single operator are evaluated. Three days of experiments with rotating operators (medical doctors without special expertise in physiological research) were conducted. ECG, blood pressure, echocardiograph, laser Doppler skin blood flowmetry, and blood sampling data were monitored. The quality of the data is assessed, as well as the effectiveness of the interaction between participants.

MURPHY (North Carolina, University, Chapel Hill) Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine (ISSN 0095-6562), vol. 62, Feb. 1991, p. 116-122. Research supported by NIH. refs Copyright Two alternative methods for quantifying impedance cardiac output were assessed for the accuracy and reliability by comparing the cardiac output values derived for six anesthesized dogs with simultaneous thermodilution measures. In the experiment, the values of the component dZ/dt(max) of the Kubicek (1966) equation were quantified relative to dZ/dt = 0 baseline or relative to the dZ/dt B-point and were entered into the Kubicek equation to generate two cardiac ouput measures designated as impedance-A and impedance-B, respectively. Alterations in cardiac output were produced by intravenously administering isoproterenol, phenylephrine, or nitroprusside. The correlations of impedance output with thermodilution (periodic 10-ml-vol injections of ice-cold saline) were found to be higher for the impedance-A method than for the impedance-B method, supporting the use of the dZ/dt(max) value relative to dZ/dt = 0 (rather than relative to the dZ/dt B-point) in the Kubicek stroke volume equation.

SIMULATIONS OF BIOMOLECULAR DYNAMICS Final Report, 15 Jun. 1987 - 14 Feb. 1990 1990 3 p (Contract DE-FG02-87ER-60543) (DE91-001977; DOE/ER-60543/3) Avail: NTIS HC/MF A01 The basic objective of the research supported by the Department of Energy grant has been to increase our understanding of and predictive ability for macromolecular systems (proteins, nucleic acids, etc.) of biological interest. For this purpose a wide range of large-scale simulations were made. They are concerned with equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena on time scales of up to a nanosecond for isolated macromolecules and macromolecules in solution. As a result of such simulations, a fundamental increase in our knowledge of the dynamical and thermodynamic properties and functions of such macromolecules, as well as more complex assemblies of biological interest has been achieved. Of particular interest are simulations of protein folding and the prediction of structural and thermodynamic changes in proteins and protein-liganded interactions induced by site-directed mutagenesis. Recent advances in computational techniques, including simulation methods for free energy changes, have been used for determining how to modify existing proteins to introduce altered properties. A molecular dynamics simulation method has been used for determining the contributions of individual amino acid residues and solvent molecules to free energy changes in proteins. A method was developed for protein secondary structure prediction based a neural network and molecular dynamics simulations were used to calculate in incoherent neutron scattering spectra of myoglobin.

NORRIS and MALA RAGHAVAN (Chicago Univ., IL.) 1990 12 p Presented at the 8th International Conference on Photochemical Conversion and Storage of Solar Energy, Palermo, Italy, 15-20 1990 (Contract W-31-109-ENG-38) (DE91-004449; CONF-900785-1) Avail: NTIS Some of the possible implications of the photochemistry of photosynthesis for artificial systems are presented. A major aspect of this paper involves the special conditions required to prevent the undesirable charge recombination via-the excited triplet state 7951 LIFE SCIENCES (GENERAL) of the primary donor. If a multi-jump model is operative in the primary events of photosynthesis, then artificial model systems are relatively easy to synthesize. Such systems prevent back reactions via a series of downhill chemical reactions. Each downhill step in energy results in an increase in charge separation distance. The annihilation reactions, even to the less energetic triplet state, involve intermediate states uphill in energy and consequently are greatly diminished. However, if superexchange is a correct explanation of photosynthesis, then model systems have not been developed that properly mimic the natural process. In particular, the triplet back reaction can occur due to the lack of any thermal activation barrier. In nature this downhill back reaction appears to be prevented by carefully balancing the energetics using four molecules in the electron transport system. If this is the case, artificial photosynthesis would also require fine tuning of the coupling and energetics with three or four molecules making duplication more difficult to achieve.

One way to begin a search for an understanding of health effects of radiation is through the development of phenomenological models of the response. Many models have been presented and tested in the slowly evolving process of characterizing cellular response. A range of models covering different endpoints and phenomena has developed in parallel. Many of these models employ similar assumptions about some underlying processes while differing about the nature of others. An attempt is made to organize many of the models into groups with similar features and to compare the consequences of those features with the actual experimental observations. It is assumed that by showing that some assumptions are inconsistent with experimental observations, the job of devising and testing mechanistic models can be simplified. DOE N91-15669 Tel-Aviv Univ.

Dr. Bing Jap has crystallized PhoE pore-forming protein (porin) from the outer membrane of escherichia coli (E. coli) into monolayer crystals. The findings of this research and those of Jap (1988, 1989) have determined these crystals to be highly ordered, yielding structural information to a resolution of better than 2.8 angstroms. The task of this thesis has been to collect and process the electron diffraction patterns necessary to generate a complete three-dimensional set of high resolution structure factor amplitudes of PhoE porin. Fourier processing of these amplitudes when combined with the corresponding phase data is expected to yield the three- dimensional structure of PhoE porin at better than 3.5 angstroms resolution.

During discussions, three general mass spectrometric approaches to the determination of DNA sequence were considered: (1) the mass spectrometric detection of isotopic labels from DNA sequencing mixtures separated using gel electrophoresis; (2) the direct mass spectrometric analysis from direct ionization of unfractionated sequencing mixtures where the measured mass of the constituents functions to identify and order the base sequence (replacing separation by gel electrophoresis); and (3) an approach in which a single highly charged molecular ion of a large DNA segment produced is rapidly sequenced in an ion cyclotron resonance ion trap. The consensus of the workshop was that, on the basis of the new developments, mass spectrometry has the potential to provide the substantial increases in sequencing speed required for the Human Genome Program.

THE ROTATING SPECTROMETER: NEW BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR CELL SEPARATIONS DAVID A. NOEVER (Universities Space Research Association, Huntsville AL.) and HELEN C. MATSOS Nov. 1990 14 studies, called the rotating spectrometer, separates previously inseparable cell cultures. The rotating spectrometer is intended for use in pharmacological studies which require fractional splitting of heterogeneous cell cultures based on cell morphology and swimming behavior. As a method to separate and concentrate cells in free solution, the rotating method requires active organism participation and can effectively split the large class of organisms known to form spontaneous patterns. Examples include the biochemical star, an organism called Tetrahymena pyriformis. Following focusing in a rotated frame, the separation is accomplished using different radial dependencies of concentrated algal and protozoan species. The focusing itself appears as concentric rings and arises from the coupling between swimming direction and Coriolis forces. A dense cut is taken at varying radii and extraction is replenished at an inlet. Unlike standard separation and concentrating techniques such as filtration or centrifugation, the instrument is able to separate motile from immotile fractions. For a single pass, typical split efficiencies can reach 200 to 300 percent compared to the inlet concentration. Author N91-15674*# National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

MATSOS Nov. 1990 19 vitro' for monitoring cadmium, one of the most lethal bivalent heavy metals, can detect biologically active levels. The effects of cadmium tend to concentrate in protozoa far above natural levels and therein begin transferring through. freshwater food chains to animals and humans. In a small sample volume (approximately 5 ml) the method uses the toxic response to the protozoa, Tetrahymena pyriformis, to cadmium. The assay relies on macroscopic bioconvective patterns to measure the toxic response, giving a sensitivity better than 1 micro-g/1 and a toxicity threshold to 7 micro-g/1 for Cd(2+). Cadmium hinders pattern, formation in a dose-dependent manner. Arrested organism growth arises from slowed division and mutation to non-dividing classes. Unlike previous efforts, this method can be performed in a shallow flow device and does not require electronic or chemical analyses to monitor toxicity.

Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) was suggested as a tool for the biomedical sciences shortly after its invention, but few attempts to use its sensitivity in such research have been reported. We have examined some of the strengths and limitations of the technique and find that AMS has a sensitivity advantage over decay-counting for the long-lived radioisotopes and for shorter-lived, common radiotracers. The advantage can be translated into the use of much smaller sample sizes and much lower radioisotope concentrations, both of which present new opportunities for biochemical tracing and human research. New approaches to separation and preparation of the material to be assayed for radiotracers will be developed to take advantage of the sensitivity and specificity. Most biochemical laboratories have used radioactive isotopes as tracers and their facilities have been contaminated with unacceptably high levels of these tracers. Careful protocols and/or new facilities are required to prevent contamination of the AMS samples. DOE N91-16539# Southwest Research Inst., San Antonio, TX.

NELSON 31 Jul. 1990 24 p were accomplished: (1) It was determined that sensory responsiveness of primary somatosensory (SI) cortical neurons to vibratory stimuli is quantitatively different depending upon whether monkeys make wrist movements in response to the stimuli or withhold movement. (2) For a special class of SI neurons, it was determined that activity occurring before movement is comprised of a reactivation of the neuron's sensor response and 8151 LIFE SCIENCES (GENERAL) a presumably centrally generated component. (3) It was determined that sensory responsiveness and premovement activity are elevated when behavioral conditions are unpredictable as compared to when they are predictable. (4) It was determined that human subjects can acquire a positional target by wrist movements more quickly if vibratory go-cues are presented in addition to the illumination of a visual signal lamp. The neurophysiological experiments suggest that the responsiveness of SI neurons is profoundly affected by behavioral conditions and an animal's expectation of correct performance. The human psychophysical experiments suggest that the addition of vibratory go-cues to control systems may have benefits without seeming to degrade performance.

NICHOLSON Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine (ISSN 0095-6562), vol. 62, Jan. 1991, p. 3-13. Research supported by the Civil Aviation Authority and British Airways, PLC. refs Copyright Sleep and circadian rhythms of aircrew were studied during a 7-d polar schedule operated between London and Tokyo. Sleep, rectal temperature, and subjective alertness were recorded for 2 d before departure during the schedule, and for 10 d after the return. Changes in sleep during the early part of the trip were due to sleep loss on the outward journey, but later these changes were related to the displacement of the circadian rhythm. The acrophases of the circadian rhythms of temperature were delayed by the outward journey, and amplitudes were reduced throughout the trip. During the return, aircrew reported high levels of tiredness which persisted until the second recovery night. Though the amounts of sleep obtained during the schedule were satisfactory for the aircrew as a group, some crewmembers experienced difficulties. Realignment of circadian rhythms was attained by an advance of the circadian phase in eight aircrew and by a delay in three, and resynchronization was achieved in all cases within 6 d.

The number of T lymphocytes was found to be higher than the baseline value, yet its rhythmicity was maintained after eastward flight with an 8-h time difference. The number of OKB2(+) as well as Leu11(+) cells were suppressed after the flight. The change in the number of T lymphocytes occurred due to the increased number of OKT4(+) lymphocytes. There was no correlation between the number of OKT4( + ) lymphocytes and the plasma cortisol level. These data showed that the number of helper/inducer T lymphocytes, B cells, and natural killer cells were affected by the physical conditions experienced after the flight. The changes in T lymphocytes were independent of those of plasma cortisol levels.

Four PSL-LBNP tests were conducted on the same time of day, separated by at least 72 hr, and using the same protocol, and five PSL-LBNP tests were conducted using protocols that varied in stage duration but not in pressure profile. Results showed that PSL-LBNP testing is a repeatable quantifiable stressor and that the heart rate and blood pressure responses to PSL-LBNP are independent of stage duration. It was also found that, when comparing protocols with different stage duration, the maximum negative pressure tolerated may be the best index of PSL-LBNP tolerance. I.S.

The first (control) group had a standard 16-min exposure in a drum rotating at 60 deg/sec, with no preexposure. The second (incremental exposure) group had two separated 4-min preexposure periods, at 15 deg/min and 30 deg/min, immediately prior to the standard 16-min exposure. The third (abrupt exposure) group had the same preexposure but with the second rotation at 60 deg/min, followed by the standard exposure. It was found that subjects in the incremental exposure group had significantly fewer motion sickness symptoms during the standard rotation period than did the subjects in the other two groups. I.S.

The present study sought to assess its impact in an operational setting. During a monthly wing safety meeting, 88 B-1B and B-52H crewmembers completed the 'B-1B Airsickness Research File' questionnaire. The questionnaire responses were analyzed using ANOVA, Chi-square median tests, and multiple regression analyses. The percent of flights in which airsickness was experienced was found to be a function of crew position but not of aircraft type or the interaction of crew position and aircraft type. The degree of in-flight incapacitation experienced, however, was significantly predicted by the combination of crew position, aircraft type, and the amount of experience flying in bombers. Pilots reported the least amount of incapacitation, as did crewmembers who flew the B-1 B and crewmembers with less bomber experience. Airsickness was reported to be a frequent occurrence among non-pilots in both aircraft. Experienced crewmembers were more likely to report an impact on their duties.

The diagnosis and management of DCS is frequently a source of confusion. Although the majority of cases are manifested by joint or limb pains (Type I DCS), patients may present with a wide array of symptoms, such as neurologic deficits, headache, fatigue, nausea, and respiratory difficulty. A thorough knowledge of the differential diagnosis and a strong index of suspicion are crucial to the proper management of DCS. Presented herein are two cases of altitude-related DCS which were confused initially with a viral syndrome. A discussion of the symptoms of DCS is included.

Journal of Applied Physiology (ISSN 0161-7567), vol. 69, Dec. 1990, p. 2072-2077. refs Copyright The effect of a dopamine antagonist metoclopramide on the responses of the various components of the renin-angiotensin system to acute hypoxemia was investigated. In the experiment, human subjects were monitored for 60 min while breathing air, then during 60 min of exposures to a hypoxic gas mixture (12 percent O2-88 percent N2), followed by another 45 min of air breathing. Metoclopramide was injected (10 mg dose) 30 min after the start of the exposure to hypoxic mixture. In the control experiment, preceding the hypoxia experiment by two weeks, the same subjects were injected metoclopramide (90 min after the start of the experiment) but were exposed to air only. It was found that, during hypoxemia, the release of aldosterone induced by metoclopramide was significantly smaller than in the control experiment. This decrease was associated with a slight increase of the immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor and with a decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels, without any change in immunoreactive blood angiotensin I.

Torque was measured at a specific knee angle during isokinetic concentric or eccentric actions at velocities between 0.17 and 3.66 rad/s and during isometric actions. It is shown that, with artificial activation, the relative changes in both eccentric and concentric torque were greater as the speed increased; the speed-torque relationship was independed of the extent of activation and was similar to that of an isolated muscle. On the other hand, activation by the central nervous system during maximal effort depended on the speed and the type of muscle action performed. I.S.

USVA. refs (Contract NAS9-16044; NAG9-297; NAG2-408; Copyright The mechanism of orthostatic intolerance observed in endurance-trained athletes was investigated by measuring progressive changes in the maximal oxygen uptake (during exercises on a bicycle ergometer), the maximal leg vasodilator capacity, the carotid barpreflex function, and the tolerance to LBNP in subjects of high, medium, and low fit conditions. Results provide suggestive evidence that highly fit endurance-trained athletes may have diminished tolerance to orthostatic stress compared with moderately fit or sedentary controls. However, the aerobic capacity data suggest that this phenomenon is not a simple linear function of fitness per se, but depends on a complex -interaction among multiple parameters of cardiovascular regulation, only some of which may be affected by fitness. Of these, the maximal calf vascular conductance is an important factor. Athletes had larger maximal vascular conductance than nonathletes, while baroreflex function appeared to be unrelated to fitness or exercise training. I.S.

GEORGE TROXLER (Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX) Aeromedical and Training Digest, vol. 5, Jan. 1991, 3 P. Copyright A unique aspect of aerospace medicine is its interdisciplinary nature, i.e., the aviation physiologist must obtain information from a number of professional and academic areas and then apply it. Coronary artery disease, adult onset diabetes, hypertension, and obesity (as a contributing factor) are diseases that have been successfully treated by diet especially in their early stages. Epidemiologic evidence has shown an association between diet and morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease, and there has been strong observational evidence that diet can affect both coronary lesion progression and formation of new lesions. This is important for flight crews to keep in mind as the alternative to dietary therapy for these diseases is often long term medication with possible side effects and therefore a shortened flying career.

Research supported by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, refs Copyright Pulsatile flow of blood through a rigid tube has been studied under the influence of body acceleration. With the help of finite Hankel and Laplace transforms, analytic expressions for axial velocity, fluid acceleration, wall shear and instantaneous volume flow rate have been obtained. The amplitude of the instantaneous volume flow rate, for flows with body acceleration, is shown to decrease sharply as the tube radius decreases (from aorta to arteriole). This variation of amplitude is very slow for flows with no body acceleration. Another interesting result is that the maximum of the axial velocity and fluid acceleration shifts from the tube axis to the vicinity of the tube wall as the tube diameter increases. The variation of the amplitude of wall shear with tube diameter (aorta to coronary) is less for flows with body acceleration than for flows with no body acceleration. The phase lag .between pressure gradient and flow rate changes sharply with tube diameter in narrow tubes, and it varies asymptotically in wide tubes.

Results have been obtained which suggest that acute fluid replacement prior to reentry may not reverse the impaired baroreflex associated with postflight hypotension. It is also noted that one bout of maximal exercise increased baroreflex sensitivity and buffer capacity through 24 hrs post exercise; these baroreflex changes were the opposite of those following head-down bedrest. Contributions-of reduced blood volume and impaired CCB function to orthostatic hypotension following microgravity appear to be separate and additive, so that maximal exercise and fluid replacement could be a potent countermeasure against postflight hypotension.

No difference was observed in the plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and cyclic GMP changes among the pre-HDT, HOT, and post-HDT infusion experiments. Urine flow, sodium excretion, andurinary cyclic GMP excretion were significantly increased. These data suggest that HOT does not induce major alterations in the regulation of an acute saline infusion and plasma ANP does not play a major role in the diuretic/natriuretic effects of volume loading.

Immersion led to reductions of the plasma level of norepinephrine and the vasopressive and antidiuretic hormones, while markedly increasing vasodepressive and diuretic hormones. The suppressive effect on sympathetic nervous activity appears to be age-dependent, being less pronounced in elderly than in youthful subjects. The suppressive effect plays an important role in the maintenance of hemodynamic homeostasis under weightlessness, to compensate for the cephalad fluid shift. O.C.

Active sinusoidal head oscillation was the stimulus for VOR tests with vision (WOR), with eyes shaded (VOR-ES), and VOR suppression (VOR-S). Eye movements were recorded by electrooculography and head position by a potentiometer. No pathological nystagmus or other abnormal eye movements were seen. No significant in-llight changes were seen in the gain, phase shift or waveform of VVOR, VOR-ES or VOR-S. Statistically significant increases in saccadic latency and decreases in saccadic velocity were seen, with no change in saccadic accuracy. Preflight differences between SMS susceptible and nonsusceptible subjects were noted only in VOR-S, with less complete suppression in susceptible subjects, a finding also seen in flight. During flight, VVOR gain was significantly increased in three nonaffected subjects. Saccades of SMS-affected subjects showed increased latency and velocity and decreased accuracy compared to saccades of unaffected subjects.

A horizontal luminous line was seen by the subjects in a headfixed goggle device. During the hypergravic phases of parabolic flight the luminous line seemed to rotate into and during the hypogravic phase against the direction of static head tilt. Ocular counterrotation and activity of the neck-position receptors cannot explain these subjective rotations. It is concluded that information from the otolith system, converging with visual information within the brain, dislocated the headfixed visual target line. While the retinal image of the luminous line remains unchanged, loading and unloading the otoliths in parabolic flight changes the sensation of self tilt into object tilt, hereby subjectively rotating visual targets such as the luminous line.

The slow-phase velocity (SPV) of the caloric nystagmus was found to increase with rising g-value, while microgravity conditions induced an exponential decay. The nystagmus entirely disappeared in microgravity, but SPV decay showed a specific time constant. Because of thesimilarities between the characteristics observed in both SPV decays and their associated time constants, it is suggested that a common working mechanism of cupular stimulation may be at work. The present results support the Barany (1907) convection theory with respect to the endolymph stimulatory properties following the caloric test. O.C.

Such alterations may have important effects on health during flight and during a recovery period after return to earth. Body fluid and electrolytes are lost, and blood levels of several hormones that control metabolism are altered during space flight. Increased serum calcium may lead to an increased risk of renal stone formation during flight, and altered drug metabolism could influence the efficacy of therapeutic agents. Orthostatic intolerance and an increased risk of fracturing weakened bones are concerns at 8652 AEROSPACE MEDICINE landing.

The results obtained suggest that, in the comparatively short period of about nine days of space habitation, the sympathoadrenal system was somewhat activated, thereby indicating a mildly stressful influence's exertion by the initial phase of spaceflight. Such a short mission did not, by comparison with a long-term one, powerfully activate the sympathoadrenal system during the process of readaptation to earth gravity. While weightlessness is not a stressful factor in this system's activation, it sensitizes responsiveness during readapta- tion to earth gravity. O.C.

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of body position on the VO2 kinetics as determined by means of the PRBS technique. Nine healthy male volunteers performed bicycle ergometer exercises in both upright and supine positions. No significant changes were seen in normalized gains and phase shifts of the power-V'O2-relationship.

The subjects were maintained on a controlled metabolic diet for 7 d before the study, during 14 d of ambulatory control, 28 d of horizontal bedrest, and 14 d of ambulant recovery. Fluid compartments were measured on control days 1 and 9, bed rest days 2, 14, and 28, and recovery days 7 and 14. By day 2 of bed rest, plasma volume and extracellular volume (ECV) decreased significantly by an average 209 and 533 ml, respectively. Red cell volume and total body water (TBW) decreased more slowly, with average losses of 128 and 1316 ml, respectively, after 28 d of bed rest. Early in the bed rest, TBW loss was mostly from the ECV. Thereafter, the TBW deficit was derived from the intracellular compartment, which decreased an average of 838 ml after 28 d. These results suggest losses from all fluid compartments during bed rest, with no evidence of restoration of ECV after 1-2 weeks.

Research supported by the U.S. Navy, refs Copyright Cold air exposure stimulates a rise in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and plasma norepinephrine (NE). The specific contribution of the beta-adrenergic receptor to this pressor response is unknown. Therefore, 12 normal men were pretreated with placebo or a bradycardia-inducing amount of propranolol prior to exposing them to either 25 C or 4 C air. At 25 C, propranolol pretreatment lowered heart rate and MAP. When changes in MAP were compared after their respective 30-min exposure at 25 C and 4 C, the cold elevated MAP by 18.4 + or - 1.5 mm Hg in subjects pretreated with propranolol compared with 13.0 + or - 2.5 mm Hg in subjects pretreated with placebo. Fingertip skin temperature measured at 4 C, 9.5 + or - 0.8 C in propranolol-pretreated subjects was lower than the 11.1 + or - 0.7 C with that of placebo group. Plasma NE increased equally during cold exposure with- both placebo and propranolol pretreatment. It is concluded that the beta receptor plays a minor role in generating the pressor response to cold air. Therefore, the effectiveness of acute administrations of propranolol for maintaining normotension in subjects exposed to cold environments may be attenuated.

Multiple regression analyses yielded a four-variable model in which gradual onset run (GOR) relaxed-G tolerance was inversely correlated with height and directly correlated with age, weight, and diastolic blood pressure. Although the four-variable model was able to predict more of the variation in G tolerance than any single variable, neither method showed a correlation (r) of greater than 0.35 with GOR relaxed or straining G tolerance. No subject variable was significantly different between the pilot groups that 8852 AEROSPACE MEDICINE did and did not experience G-induced loss of consciousness. It is concluded that prediction of G tolerance during centrifuge HGT is unreliable using anthropometric and physiologic variables. The anti-G straining maneuver remains the major determinant of an individual's G tolerance. Author A91-23514 LOCOMOTION AND MOTION SICKNESS DURING HORIZONTALLY AND al. Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine (ISSN 0095-6562), vol. 62, Feb. 1991, p. 136-140. refs Copyright Locomotion and motion sickness during reversed vision were studied in ten normal subjects and a patient with bilateral labyrinthine loss. Whereas horizontal reversal produced moderate to severe gait disturbances as well as motion sickness in all normal subjects, vertical reversal failed to induce such symptoms. The patient, being free of motion sickness during both reversals, could not walk straight during horizontal reversal. The difference in the strength of sensory mismatch between both directions seemed to result from a difference in the role of vision for spatial orientation which is produced by the proprioceptive as well as otolithic inputs of gravity.

Twenty-six subjects were tested in a rotating sphere at a speed of 45 deg/s, resulting in vertical yaw, horizontal roll, or pitch vection. Coincidently, subjects pitched, rolled, or yawed their heads (0.5 Hz, 20 deg). It was found that yaw vection combined with pitch or roll head movements significantly increased MS, while pitch vection with any type of head movement, or head and scene rotation about the same axis significantly reduced MS. When the head was kept stationary, pitch vection was most stressful for MS, followed by roll vection, then yaw vection, although yaw vection was the strongest sensation of self-rotation.

In experiments, a zero-order pursuit tracking task was first performed with and without direct visual control of the hand, followed by an experiment in which an imaginary target linked to the hand was tracked using the same experimental setup. It was found that, when hand was, out of sight, the hand vibration significantly altered the eye and hand tracking performances, but that the effect was less pronounced when the hand was placed in the visual field. The results suggest that the eye and the handtracking systems are synchronized by a common mechanism and that direct visual control of the hand can partially compensate for the performance alteration caused by hand vibration.

Recent studies in this institution indicate, however, that the time-course behavior patterns of these ST/T configurational 'abnormalities' after exercise are different from those reflecting myocardial ischemia due to epicardial CAD. Time-course analysis increases the predictive value of exercise testing and has dramatically decreased the number of asymptomatic aircrew being subjected to coronary arteriography. Routine exercise electrocardiography provides a reliable, cost-effective means of detecting aircrew with CAD and a baseline for comparison at subsequent examination.

Research supported by the American Society for Engineering Education, refs (Contract NGT-60002) Copyright An accepted method for measuring the responsiveness of the carotid-cardiac baroreflex to arterial pressure changes is to artificially stimulate the baroreceptors in the neck with a pressurized neck chamber. Nine physiological responses to this type of stimulation are quantified and used as indicators of the baroreflex response function. Thirty male humans between the ages of 27 and 46 underwent the carotid-cardiac baroreflex'test. The data for the nine response parameters were analyzed by principle component factor analysis. The results indicated that 92.5 percent of the total variance across all nine parameters could be explained in four dimensions. The first two dimensions reflected location points for R-R interval and carotid distending pressure, respectively. The third factor was composed of measures reflecting the gain (responsiveness) of the reflex. The fourth dimension was the ratio of baseline R-R interval to the maximal R-R interval response during simulated hypertension. The data suggest that the analysis of all nine baroreflex parameters is likely to be redundant and researchers should account for these redundancies either in their analyses or conclusions.

Thesis DORON EZRA Aug. 1988 88 p In HEBREW; ENGLISH summary (ITN-90-85039) Copyright Avail: Tel-Aviv Univ., Exact Sciences Library, Ramat Aviv 69778, Israel The aim was to develop an algorithm to classify chromosomes more effectively and simply than the currently available Karotype systems some of which achieve 90 percent success in identification. 8952 AEROSPACE MEDICINE Small computers are to be used. Working assumptions were: input must be uniform regarding the supplying laboratory and the type of test (blood, amniotic fluid, etc.); the classification must be based on the system's own study and analysis of the data; the system must include apparatus for automatic measurement of the properties used in classification; the algorithm must be partly based on statistical analysis of the data. The chosen algorithm uses a 2-phase classification process. The first phase groups 24 chromosome types according to chromosome length and centromer position. The second phase uses the density profile to describe the chromosome internal structure and complete the classification within the main groups. A clustering algorithm was used for the first phase. An algorithm which uses several weighting functions to analyze the density profile was used for the second phase. A final classification algorithm was used which uses the multivariate normal density function model. The algorithms were applied to a KARYOTEC 100 system, developed by Amcor Electronics. Tests were run on data from 31 normal cells, taken for testing amniotic fluid and which contained 1135 chromosomes. The results confirmed expectations. The classification achieved an overall 88 percent success level, and was almost 100 percent successful in the separation of chromosomes into main groups. ISA N91-15676 Tel-Aviv Univ. (Israel).

Thesis ABRAHAM BLAU Jan. 1989 131 p In HEBREW; ENGLISH summary (ITN-90-85060) Copyright Avail: Tel Aviv Univ., Exact Sciences Library, Ramat Aviv 69978, Israel Evoked potentials are biological potentials set up in the body in response to an external stimulus. Methods, to average out the background noise in measurements of evoked potentials were studied and developed. The study of weighting algorithms, which inversely relate measurement weighting to the measured noise level, comprised theoretical background, case studies and simulation. Weighting methods were found to be generally effective, especially when the noise power varied during the experiment. Study of the development of a noise filter, based on a priori knowledge of the noise and signal spectra included a critical review of the available literature and the development of a new algorithm, based on A Posteriori Optimal Filtering (APOF). The optimal filter calculation uses estimations of the signal and noise autocorrelations. Guidelines adopted for APOF development included: minimal a priori assumptions; the possibility of on-line use of the method; and a desired waiting period of no more than a few seconds, for the estimated evoked potential value. Evaluation of APOF performance was based on laboratory measurements and simulated data; it was compared with the average method and with A Posteriori Wiener Filtering (APWF), which operates in the frequency domain. The main conclusions were: that the APOF estimator is better than the average estimator in most cases; that APOF is a little better than APWF; that APOF performance falls off with increasing number of measurements, owing to the assumption that the signal is a stationary process; and that APOF can be easily generalized to include the case of non-stationary processes. A time-varying optimal filter in the time domain is suggested as a method for improving the performance of APOF in the case of non-stationary evoked potentials.

Noninvasive techniques suitable for studies of the structure and function of human visual cortex include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission (ERFs). The primary challenge faced by noninvasive functional measures is to optimize the spatial and temporal resolution of the measurement and analytic techniques in order to effectively characterize the spatial and temporal variations in patterns of neuronal activity. In this paper we review the use of neuromagnetic techniques for this purpose. DOE N91-15681# Los Alamos National Lab., NM. Complex Systems Group.

The evolution of ' the neural activity in these circuits depends on their present state as well as on their past states, due to finite propagation time of neural activity along the feedback loop. These systems are often seen to undergo a change from a quiescent state characterized by low level fluctuations to an oscillatory state. We discuss the problem of analyzing this transition using techniques from nonlinear dynamics and stochastic processes. Our main goal is to characterize the nonlinearities which enable autonomous oscillations to occur and to uncover the properties of the noise sources these circuits interact with. The concepts are illustrated on the human pupil light reflex (PLR) which has been studied both theoretically and experimentally using this approach.

Two portions of the investigation, the 'sled' and 'dome' functional objectives, involved recording the torsional motion of human subject's eyes. In the SL-1 sled and dome experiments, preflight and postflight ocular torsion was recorded on 35 mm film using a Nikon motor driven camera (2.6 frames/sec). The film was to be analyzed by measuring the motion of contact lens landmarks using a Hermes senior film scanner. However, an inflight failure of the dome experiment camera flash unit led the crew to utilize the Spacelab video camera as an alternative contingency method for imaging the eye in this FO. A suitable method for analysis of the video data was developed. Results of the analysis are presented. Author N91-15683# Technion - Israel Inst. of Tech., Haifa. Inst. of Biomedical Engineering.

ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE VOLUMETRY IN THE CIRCULATION Ph.D. Thesis - 1988 Abstract Only JOHN CAMPBELL WOODARD 1 Jun. 1990 3 p Avail: Issuing Activity The measurement of changes in blood volume is examined using electrical resistance techniques. The utility of such cardiovascular measurements was assessed for use with implantable devices. Intracardiac measurements were made in both greyhound dogs and human volunteers with an 8-electrode catheter which was also used for intravascular resistance measurements. Transcardiac resistance of greyhound hearts was obtained from epicardial electrodes used with implantable defibrillators. These in-vivo experiments were supplemented with in-vitro investigations using canine tissues and computer simulation, to determine the geometric factors influencing the performance of the conductance catheter and the magnitude of changes in tissue resistivity under various conditions. Good transduction of ventricular volume change was obtained from the multi-electrode catheter in the right ventricle under a variety of interventions. However anatomical factors, principally the location of the tricuspid valve, limited the proportion of the ventricle that could be effectively transduced and necessitated careful positioning of the catheter to obtain accept- able volume transduction. Computer simulation and in-vitro measurements showed that the radial position of the catheter in a vessel of constant cross-section could result in errors in volume measurement, and that this error could be minimized by a large separation of the current-injecting electrodes. Transcardiac resistance was found to be unrelated to ventricular volume changes, but was strongly associated with the level of coordinated mechanical activity of the heart. Both transcardiac resistance and volume measurements from a right ventricular catheter appear suitable for detection of ventricular fibrillation. Although volume transduction using a right ventricular catheter is subject to error during arrhythmias, this technique could be used for rate-regulation of an artificial pacemaker.

NAKAGAWARA Sep. 1990 CSCL 06/4 Federal Aviation Regulations permit the routine use of contact lenses by civilian pilots to satisfy the distant visual acuity requirements for obtaining medical certificates. Specific information identifying the prevalence of both defective distant vision and contact lenses in the civil airman population is required to guide future medical certification decisions, policy changes, and education safety programs for aviation personnel. A descriptive, retrospective epidemiologic study was performed of active airmen by 5-year intervals for a 20-year period (1967 to 1987) using FAA databases and publications. The percentage of airmen who use contact lenses 9152 AEROSPACE MEDICINE quadrupled during the study period. When stratified by class of medical certificate and age, the prevalence rates for airmen with first-class medical certificates and older airmen showed the largest increases. The increasing use of contact lenses and the variety of design, materials, and applications which may be employed by the pilot population mandate ongoing review for adverse changes and safety consequences.

GLAISTER In AGARD, Safety Network to Detect Performance Degradation and Pilot Incapacitation 4 p Sep. 1990 Copyright Avail: NTIS HC/MF A06; Non-NATO Nationals requests available only from AGARD/Scientific Publications Executive G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) is a common eventand has led to the loss of many aircraft and aircrew. While most body systems are ultimately affected, the final common path for its initiation is an inadequate supply of oxygen to the brain. Thus, a measure of cerebral oxygen sufficiency could provide a specific monitor for incipient G-LOC and serve either as a warning to the pilot or as a trigger for an autorecovery system. Multiwavelength near IR spectrophotometry permits the noninvasive in vivo measurement of the oxygen content of blood within the cerebral microcirculation, and also of the oxygen status of cytochrome-c oxidase within the brain cells. This technique was validated in human subjects during exposure to hypoxia; in presyncope induced by lower body negative pressure; and during +G sub z induced loss of consciousness. As well as providing an important new tool for acceleration research, the technique has the potential to be developed into an inflight monitor for aircrew.

One transcranial Doppler pulse device was developed specifically to function in a centrifuge and another for use in a Mirage 2000, causing limitations to respect the secure environment required by use in flight. During a study conducted for the evaluation of acceleration tolerance of 9 subjects at +8 Gz, the transcranial Doppler device showed the existence in 23 instances of a relationship between velocimetric signal reduction of an average cerebral arterial circulation and the decrease of the field of view; in 9 instances, this relationship was not observed,- and in 1 case a weak decrease of the Doppler signal was followed by LOG. The detection and analysis of LOG in flight of many physiological and flight factors will cause the release of automatic safety procedures by the onboard computer. This necessitates the development of new and complex procedures. In this case, the-best treatment for LOG consist of being put in a preventive position thanks to new anti-G protection (inclined seat, positive pressure respiration, anti-G pants for the lower body).

Subjects were tested on various paper-and-pencil aiming and tapping tasks during both normal and varied gravity in flight. It was found that changes in g level caused directional errors in the z body axis (the gravity axis), the arm aiming too high under Og and too low under 2g. The standard deviation also increased for both vertical and lateral movements in the mid-frontal plane. Both variable and directional errors were greater under Og than 2g. In an unpaced reciprocal tapping task subjects tended to increase their error rate rather than their movement time, but showed a non-significant trend towards slower speeds under Og for all movement orientations. Larger variable errors or slower speeds were probably due to the difficulty of re-organizing a motor skill in an unfamiliar force environment, combined with anchorage difficulties under Og.

ALI TAALEBINEZHAAD Mar. 1990 22 In motion vision, the problem is to find, from a sequence of time varying images, the relative rotational and translational velocities between a viewer and an environment as well as the shape of objects in the environment. This paper introduces a direct method called fixation for solving the general motion vision problem. This method results in a constraint equation between translational and rotational velocities that in combination with the brightness-change constraint equation solves the general motion vision problem, arbitrary motion with respect to an arbitrary rigid environment. Avoiding correspondence and optical flow was the motive behind the direct methods because both solving the correspondence problem and computing the optical flow reliably have proven to be rather difficult and computationally expensive. Recent direct motion vision methods, which directly use the image brightness information such as temporal and spatial brightness gradients directly, have used the brightness-change constraint equation for solving the motion vision problem in special cases such as known depth, pure translation or known rotation, pure rotation, planar world and quadratic patches. In contrast to these solutions, the fixation method does not put such severe restrictions on the motion or the environment. GRA N91-15686# Air Force Human Resources Lab., Brooks AFB, TX.

SHORT TERM RETENTION OF TEMPORAL SEQUENCE, SPATIAL LOCATION, AND ITEM MAGNITUDE INFORMATION M.S. Thesis - Colorado Univ.

Theoretically motivated analyses reveal that rapid and reliable storage and retrieval of information in Long Term Memory (LTM) appears to be a key general characteristic experts' information processing, and that acquired memory skills enable experts to use LTM efficiently to reduce the constraints that limited working memory capacity imposes upon performance in complex tasks. The studies also document the efficient information processing strategies on cognitive skill acquisition and expert performance. GRA N91-16550# Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore, MD.

CALDWELL, JR. and H: D. JONES In AGARD, Safety Network to Detect Performance Degradation and Pilot Incapacitation 10 p Sep. 1990 Copyright Avail: NTIS HC/MF A06; Non-NATO Nationals requests available only from AGARD/Scientific Publications Executive The requirement for aviators to operate under stressful circumstances raises concerns over both safety and effectiveness. Although appropriate countermeasures for stress induced performance deteriorations are available, the implementation of these countermeasures require that commanders know the time course and extent of the problem. For this reason, the U.S. Army has focused research on the practical assessment of helicopter pilot degradation using flight performance assessments which combine enhanced automation and objectivity with optimized data analysis procedures. Recently, the sensitivity, accuracy, and consistency of these assessment systems were demonstrated while studying the effects of atropine sulfate on aviator performance. Both simulator and helicopter systems detected atropine related performance problems across a variety of aircraft control parameters. Also, analysis of combined simulator and helicopter data showed remarkable consistency of effects across the two flight platforms. This verification of performance measurement using computerized schemes in both simulator and aircraft has substantiated a feasible methodology, and has helped the concept development of better assessment devices.

COBLENTZ, R. MOLLARD, PH. GABON, J. P. FOUILLOT, and VINCENT CARMIGNIANI (Direction Generate de I'Avialion Civile, Paris, France ) In AGARD, Safety Network to Detect Performance Degradation and Pilot Incapacitation 17 p Sep. 1990 In FRENCH Copyright Avail: NTIS HC/MF A06; Non-NATO Nationals requests available only from AGARD/Scientific Publications Executive The various states of alertness and performance during thecourse of monotonous activity has been demonstrated by many authors. In transport aviation, the monotony often found associated with the cycle of irregular work and timeshift is important. The interaction of these factors contribute to the amplification of a drop in performance and vigilance. After a study of pilot behavior during long range flight, a project was started. The objeciive was to identify phases of hypovigilance and to evaluate the repercussions on pilot performance. The method used rest deprivation as an objective evaluation of physiological levels of pilot alertness together with an analysis of different activities of electroencephalogram (EEG), electro-oculagram (EOC), and electrocardiogram (ECG) during flight. The cardiac frequency and driving wrist activity were both recorded during flight and periods of rest. The driving wrist activity allows the acquisition of data on the activity-rest cycles of pilots. The observation of activity and of crew task is made simultaneously in this recording using a coded grid. Eight long range transmeridian flights, north-south was used during the first stage of protocol completion. The first results show large variations in the EEG spectra and in the frequency of eye movements. The alternation of phases during which the pilots show elevated vigilance with drowsiness were seen in each crew member. The deprivation of sleep during stopover show repercussions on pilot behavior. In particular, the lowest vigilance appear most pronounced during flight following a night with sleep deprivation, especially if the flight is during the next day. Transl. by E.R.

COMPUTER AIDED PHYSIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE FUNCTIONAL STATE OF PILOTS DURING SIMULATED FLIGHT KURT OFFENLOCH and GISELA ZAHNER In AGARD, Safety Network to Detect Performance Degradation and Pilot Incapacitation 9 p Sep. 1990 Sponsored by Dornier G.m.b.H. from Publications Executive Multichannel (polygraphic) analysis of cardiovascular and neurophysiological parameters provides very sensitive indicators of the functional state of subjects such as pilots during real or simulated flight missions which thus can be objectively assessed. In 6 pilots flying a fighter jet simulator with ALPHA JET dynamic characteristics without self motion, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, four channel electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) were continuously recorded during a rest-activity-rest sequence for 60 min. The activities consisted of tracking another plane flying ahead of the piloted plane with four different degrees of difficulty. The analysis of the data, especially those of the EEG by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), revealed task dependent, and in the case of EEG, topographically different cortical activities depending upon whether sensory and/or motor systems were involved. The physiological measures thus obtained can serve as an objective criterion to assess the functional state of pilots and may serve as part of an automatic safety network not only in the event of sudden loss of consciousness but also in cases of lowered cases of pilot vigilance due to fatigue.

BOY In AGARD, Safety Network to Detect Performance Degradation and Pilot Incapacitation 6 p Sep. 1990 Copyright Avail: NTIS HC/MF A06; Non-NATO Nationals requests available only from AGARD/Scientific Publications Executive An artificial intelligence approach is presented to detecting performance degradation and pilot incapacitation. The motivations are discussed for Intelligent Assistant Systems in such situations. The problem of constructing procedures is shown to be a very critical issue. In particular, keeping procedural experience in both design and operation is critical. It is suggested what artificial 9554 MAN/SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SUPPORT intelligence can offer in this direction, and the concept of Integrated Human-Machine Intelligence is presented. Some crucial problems induced by this approach are discussed in detail. Finally, the various roles are analyzed that would be shared by both the pilot and the intelligent assistant system.

BELIAVIN (RAF, Institute of Aviation Medicine, Farnborough, England) Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine (ISSN 0095-6562), vol. 62, Jan. 1991, p. 67-74. refs Copyright Traditionally, the number of aircrew helmet size rolls has been determined using head length and breadth for specified percentile ranges of a target population. Helmet mounted display technology will require taking the third dimension (pupil-vertex height) into account. Using data from 'An Anthropometric Survey of 2000 Royal Air Force Aircrew, 1970/1971', the three head dimensions of length, breadth, and pupil-vertex height were plotted for each subject. A minimum number of helmet sizes was calculated to achieve a reasonable quality of fit. The 93.5 percent of subjects grouped around the population mean was the largest fraction which had a reasonable quality of fit while using nine sizes. Attempts to fit a larger percentage would require either a large increase in the number of sizes or a relaxing of fitting quality.

Copyright Approaches to the problem of gravity-induced loss of conciousness (GLOC) connected with the increasing demand for fighter aircraft agility are considered. The USAF's leading anti-GLOC program is 'Combat Edge', an assisted positive-pressure breathing system. When the system detects increasing gravity forces it pressures air into the pilot's lungs through a modified mask that automatically tightens the mask straps. The F-16's, which have experienced most of the GLOC losses in the USAF, are to be fully equipped in 1992, as will the F-15 fighters. An added improvement to this system is the flight-control activated anti-g valve that is designed to interface with the MIL-STD-1553B databus, so that it responds when the pilot commands high g through the flight control system, rather than reacting to the movement of the aircraft. Development is continuing on a loss-of-consciousness monitoring system, which would trigger an automatic recovery system and prevent the aircraft from crashing. R.E.P.

Thesis DAVID PRUTCHI Dec. 1988 189 p (ITN-91-85068) Avail: Tel-Aviv Univ., Exact Sciences Library, Ramat Aviv 69978, Israel The aim is to develop a method, instrument, and techniques to measure and analyze the dynamic contact stress distribution between the human body and a supporting flexible cushion. Conductive silicon elastomers formed the sensing material in transducer elements developed and evaluated as local contact stress measurement transducers. The three different sensors whose static and time dependent properties were measured were: Graphite loaded conductive foam; the commercially manufactured Force Sensing Resistor, based on variations of mechanical contact between a conductive elastomer and a metallic electrode; and the Contact Geometric Modulation Transducer (CGMT), based on the pressure induced change in contact area between a V-shaped conductive elastomer string and comb-like contact electrodes. The last type was developed to overcome some limitations of the other two. The sensors were used in the form of a matrix array, in flexible printed circuit boards, designed to form thin, flexible, high resolution pressure sensing mats which can comply with the interface between a human body and a supporting cushion. A new technique was developed to analyze the data yielded by the measurement of the contact pressures. This technique is based on the time domain to frequency domain transformation of the data collected at every location, and was implemented through the use of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm; it presents the results in the form of spectral components of the contact stresses. This data analysis method provides the basis of a technique for designing and evaluating composite cushioning systems, intended to protect the human body from vibration and impact loads. Further. biomechanical applications are proposed, e.g., the study and prevention of decubitus ulcer formation; and the design of work chairs.

IMPORTANCE OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS IN INDUSTRIAL WASTE TREATMENT POTENTIAL APPLICATION TO THE SPACE STATION NATHANIEL REVIS and GEORGE HOLDSWORTH In NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center, Space Station Freedom Toxic and Reactive Materials Handling 19 p Jul. 1990 Avail: NTIS HC/MF A99 CSCL 06/11 In addition to having applications for waste management issues on planet Earth, microbial systems have application in reducing waste volumes aboard spacecraft. A candidate for such an application is the space station. Many of the planned experiments generate aqueous waste. To recycle air and water the contaminants from previous experiments must be removed before the air and water can be used for other experiments. This can be achieved using microorganisms in a bioreactor. Potential bioreactors (inorganics, organics, and etchants) are discussed. Current technologies that may be applied to waste treatment are described. Examples of how biological systems may be used in treating waste on the space station. B.G.

HUMAN FACTORS DESIGN GUIDANCE DURING THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PHASE OF SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT: A METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH Final Technical Report, Aug. 1985 - Sep. 1989 LAWRENCE S. FINEGOLD and MICHAEL T. LAWLESS Jun. 1990 14 process limitations inhibit the most effective use of human factors data in the design of complex man-machine systems. These limitations are described and a possible methodological solution is offered that incorporates human factors issues into the conceptual phase of system design. A current Air Force weapon system is reviewed historically and an application of the methodology to this system is reported. The methodological approach uses subject matter experts to assess various human performance issues on hypothetical systems through mental imagery. In-depth research was required to fully describe the hypothetical systems so that conceptualized operations could be. conducted. Lessons learned are presented.

GLOC is not a new problem, it has been around for over 70 years. Because of the emergence of high performance aircraft such as the F-16 and F-15 and the fact that these aircraft can perform beyond the acceleration tolerance limits of the human, GLOC has become the U.S. Tactical Air Force's second most serious human factors problem, second only to spatial disorientation. To date, there exists no monitoring system in USAF aircraft to detect when a pilot has become incapacitated due to GLOC. The incorporation of high G onset training and a special centrifuge training facility will help reduce, but not eliminate, the GLOC problem. The current status is presented of a LOG detection and recovery system being developed. Author N91-16557# Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Arlington, VA. Tactical Technology Office. FRAMEWORK FOR AN EFFICIENT TWO FILTER GLOC MONITOR DENNIS K. MCBRIDE and ELIZABETH A. DAVIES (Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, MD.) In AGARD; Safety Network to Detect Performance Degradation and Pilot Incapacitation 7 p Sep. 1990 Copyright Avail: NTIS HC/MF A06; Non-NATO Nationals requests available onjy from AGARD/Scientific Publications Executive A multiple filter Gravitational Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) design framework was derived. The framework recognizes the computational limitations of current and modified airborne avionics suites. The sequential gating approach minimizes load on supporting computer resources. As context and symptoms dictate, however, appropriate processing is applied. The framework is introduced as a provocative statement of design constraints inherent in 1970's jet architectures. The simplicity of design and implementation minimizes software engineering requirements, and holds hardware/interface development to but one requisite innovation; a helmet integrated, ICS capable earplug that would serve as a blood velocity, Doppler sensing and transdusing agent. .

Data already exists from specialist labs which show a reliable increase in the DC levels of brain activity with increasing workloads. In order to optimize workloads, the objective of future missions are predicted and analyzed. Following this detailed task analysis, timeline analysis and attentional demand analysis are used to identify the extent to which particular cognitive channels, e.g., visual, auditory, and psychomotor are being used at any one time. In parallel with this analysis, evoked response techniques are developed from the lab studies towards man mountable apparatus for in-flight use. This requires the development of .low noise electrically isolated DC amplifiers of high dynamic range design to obtain physiological data from the man with the minimum of operator support. An aim is to provide a high degree of perceived realism in lab tasks including the accomplishment of secondary tasks. Author N91-16563# Man-Made Systems Corp., Ellicott City, MD. DEVELOPMENT OF A TEST-BED FOR REAL-TIME MONITORING OF PILOT MENTAL STATUS RICHARD L. HORST, DAN T. SMITH, and JOHN K. NEBEL (Advanced Resource Development Corp., Columbia, MD.) In AGARD, Safety Network to Detect Performance Degradation and Pilot Incapacitation 9 p Sep. 1990 Copyright Avail: NTIS HC/MF A06; Non-NATO Nationals requests available only from AGARD/Scientific Publications Executive The real time determination of pilot mental and physical status is a critical feature of the workload monitoring and Mindware subsystems that have been envisioned for future jet aircraft. Recent lab and simulator studies, using retrospective data analyses, have suggested the value of various behavioral and physiological indices for reflecting task performance. Software algorithms - were developed to derive some of these measures in real time and to develop a test bed in which to explore the efficacy of these measures for inferring operationally relevant changes in pilot status. The project showed the feasibility and usefulness of the approach. Data processing algorithms were developed for characterizing and integrating physiological indices based on heart rate and heart rate variability, eye blinks, and single trial, scalp recorded event related potentials. These physiological measures were obtained concurrently with behavioral measures as subjects performed a PC based, aviation simulation task. The data processing algorithms were implemented in a distributed processing configuration, using multiple personal computers, with the derived measures being integrated by a decision maker multiprocessor.

FINNERTY, GOULD GIBBONS, JR., MATTHEW SCHROEDER, LISA COPLAND, and TANYA SWIDERSKI Sep. CSCL 07/2 Laboratory studies were carried out to determine the feasibility of removing certain toxic gases from a vehicle atmosphere. Both nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO) were studied in the concentration range 200 to 2000 parts per million (ppm). Only non-toxic agents were considered for removal of these gases. The most efficient scrubbing agents found were: water, diammonium phosphate and Monnex with NO2, MAP (mono- ammonium phosphate) and alum with NO. Unfortunately, no single powder showed promise of removing both the toxic gases. The presence of a base (sodium bicarbonate) in the water mist did not enhance the removal of NO2 from the atmosphere.

WHOLE BODY CLEANSING AGENT Patent Application STEVEN E. LENTSCH, inventor (to NASA) (ECO-Labs., Cleveland, OH.) 29 May 1990 15 p relates to a human cleansing agent particularly suitable for use in long duration spaceflight and a method of bathing with the agent. The agent of the subject invention is in the form of a paste having a pH of 5.0 to 7.9 which comprises an acyltaurate, a skin conditioner, a hair conditioner, and a preservative. More .specifically, it includes sodium N-coconut acid-N-methyl taurate, in combination with soybean lecithin, polyquaternium 16, and formalin. This particular combination satisfies the following objectives: (1) that it be usable with a minimum amount of water per shower (approximately 1 gallon); (2) that it be easily separated from the water for purposes of water reclamation; (3) that it be pH compatible with skin and hair; (4) that it rinse well in deionized water; (5) that it be mild to skin and eyes; (6) that it effectively clean both skin and hair; (7) that it be suitable for use in zero gravity; and (8) that it provide ease of combing of wet and dry hair. The method of the invention includes the steps of wetting the skin and hair with a small quantity of water, lathering the skin with the paste, rinsing the lather from the skin and hair with a small quantity of water to produce a rinse water containing the cleansing agent, defoaming the rinse water, and supplying the defoamed rinse water to a water reclamation unit for recycling the water. The novelty of the invention appears to lie in the particular formulation of the cleansing agent and its method of use which provide optimal results under the given constraints and objectives.

KINNEY, ed. and BEVERLY MESSICK HUEY, ed. National Academy Press 1990 73 p Workshop held in Washington, DC, 22 Oct. 1990 on Human Factors organized the Workshop on Application Principles for Multicolored Displays to examine a subset of problems associated with the current use of color in displays. Multicolored displays are used in a variety of civilian and military systems, and the rapid expansion of the field has technical developments from diverse fields. A great number of complex, interacting factors determine the effectiveness of a color display system. Although many of these factors characterize visual displays in general, many others are specifically related to the production and use of color. The .latter include both human visual perceptual factors and color display hardware characteristics that cannot reasonably .be treated in isolation. There is substantial evidence that people prefer color. The significantly higher sales of color television sets and color photographic film and the almost exclusive production of motion pictures in color are examples of the preference. Since color will probably be used, even demanded, in displays, whether essential or not, a high priority should be given to employing it effectively, even though multicolored displays are not necessary or advantageous for all applications.

A comparison, in terms of search times and mental image of the mission pattern, was made between an air picture in which the own and enemy aircraft coupled in the mission have the same color, and one in which those elements of a mission pattern shows that the mental image with color coding is richer than with line coding. The number of recalled missions is about 10 percent higher. There is no difference in the spatial accuracy for the two types of presentation. The search time (about 3 sec) is the same in the two conditions. The subjects strongly preferred color coding. The comments of the subjects indicate that the air picture is more organized.

Two clothing layers were taken into account in the model. The model is based on a network and calculates the temperatures in both layers, the microclimate, and the heat flow from skin and clothing. For the experimental verification only the dry heat flow was measured by wrapping the subjects in plastic foil. Wind and movement decrease clothing temperature and insulation. Measured and calculated temperatures agree very well. In an experiment where the subjects wore absorbing, reflecting, and transmitting garments' while walking, the radiation properties were determined; the mean difference between measured and calculated temperatures and heat flows was 1.2 C and 2.2 W, respectively.

The key requirements for the design of an orbital habitat were reviewed, such as atmospheric pressure, temperature, radiation and gravity levels. The human factors such as life cycle, ergonomy and psychological needs were examined. A common approach for these three cases may be to use as much available hardware in each step of the scenario as possible. The implementation of the habitation systems offers the possibility to work in an evolutionary way, starting with the EMSI Columbus based hardware.

At least one copy of nearly every NASA and NASA-sponsored publication, either in printed or microfiche format, is received and retained by the 51 regional depositories. A list of the regional GPO libraries, arranged alphabetically by state, appears on the inside back cover. These libraries are not sales outlets. A local library can contact a Regional Depository to help locate specific reports, or direct contact may be made by an individual.
