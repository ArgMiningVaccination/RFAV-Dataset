To deliver on that commitment and meet immediate needs, we are requesting $11.7 billion for security and eco nomic assistance for the first quarter of FY 2023, as well as $2 billion to help address the impacts Putin's war has had on domestic energy supply and reduce energy costs in the future. To date, roughly three -quarters of the direct military and budgetary s upport that Congress previously provided for Ukraine has been disbursed or committed, with even more expected by the end of the fiscal year. As we said at the time, those resources were intended to last through September. We have rallied the world to suppo rt the people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and we cannot allow that support to Ukraine to run dry. The people of Ukraine have inspired the world, and the Administration remains committed to supporting the Ukrainian people as they continue to s tand resolute and display extraordinary courage in the face of Russia's full -scale invasion. The table below provides more detail on the breakdown of the Administration's request. Department Funding (billions) Purpose and Description: Defense $7.2 $4.5 billion f or equipment for Ukraine , replenishment of Department of Defense stocks , and $2.7 billion for continued military, intelligence , and other defense support State and USAID $4.5 For direct budget support to Ukraine to support the continuity o f government Energy $2.0 $1.5 billion for uranium to fuel U.S. nuclear reactors to offset a potential decrease in Russian supplies and $500 million for modernizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to reduce domestic energy costs and ensure sustainable acce ss to energy resources Total: $13.7 billion The request also includes $3.6 billion in additional Section 506 Presidential Drawdown Authority . COVID -19 Our COVID -19 response efforts continue to require additional funding. In March, we requested that Congress provide supplemental COVID -19 funding and repeatedly warned that without congressional action, we would be forced to make difficult trade -offs and pull existing funding from critical efforts to meet the most pressing needs. That is precisely what has happened. For example, the lack of additional funding has prevented us from adequately replenishing our national stockpile of at -home tests, forced us to suspend sending free tests to Americans, and leaves our domestic testing capacity d iminished for a potential fall surge. While we have made tremendous progress in our ability to protect against and treat COVID -19, we must stay on our front foot. Doing so requires additional resources, which is why today we are updating our previous fundi ng request. The updated request is for $22.4 billion to meet immediate short -term domestic needs, including testing; accelerate the research and development of next - generation vaccines and therapeutics; prepare for future variants; and support the global r esponse to COVID -19. This funding is vital to our ability to protect and build on the progress we've made. The table below provides more detail on the breakdown of the Administration's request. COVID -19 Department Funding (billions) Purpose and Description: HHS $7.1 To procure additional vaccines effective against variants, monoclonal antibodies and pre -exposure prophylaxis for immune -compromised people, personal protective equipment for the Strategic National Stockpile, funding to cover the cost of administration of v accines for the uninsured and underinsured during the upcoming campaign, and provide other services, including improved access to treatment for people with Long COVID HHS $2.0 To continue critical testing programs, including free community testing at phar macies and sustainment of testing capacity , and capability to distribute free tests to households HHS $8.0 To accelerate critical research and development activities for next -generation COVID vaccines and therapeutics HHS $1.3 To support ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials for adult and pediatric vaccines and for surveillance and lab capacity to detect emerging variants Subtotal, HHS: $18.4 State and USAID $4.0 To support shots in arms , therapeutics and diagnostics, and preparedness and response capacity internationally Total, COVID : $22.4 Monkeypox We strongly urge Congress to provide critical resources to bolster our efforts to fight monkeypox. From the outset of the current outbreak, the Administration has pulled every lever to stop the spread of the virus, including depleting significant reserves from our national stockpile to make over 1.1 million vials of vaccine available to states and cities across the country. While we have accelerated the distribution of hundreds of thousands of vaccines, made testing more available, and expanded access to tens of thousands of courses of treatment to reach the highest -risk population, we cannot let up until we end the current outbreak a nd are prepared for future monkeypox or smallpox outbreaks. To continue meeting the fast -evolving threat of monkeypox, successfully end the current outbreak, and prepare for any future outbreaks, we're asking Congress for $3.9 billion to help ensure ready access to vaccinations, testing, treatment, and operational support for the American people, as well as $600 million to do our part to combat the spread globally. This funding will also help ensure the United States is at the front of the line for the best tools to fight any possible future outbreak. The table below provides more detail on the breakdown of the Administration's request. Monkeypox Department Funding (billions) Purpose and Description: HHS $1.6 For vaccine and therapeutic procurement, expanding domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity , and related operations HHS $0.9 To support public health activities including testing capacity , vaccine administration, and surveillance and epidemiology studies, and to provide support to states , localities , and STI clinics on the front lines HHS $1.2 To provide testing , treatment , and vaccination services , including through Ryan White clinics and community health centers HHS $0.2 For high -priority research and development, including to test vaccine effectiveness in special populations and develop rapid tests Subtotal, HHS: $3.9 State and USAID $0.6 To support vaccine readiness, diagnostics, treatments, and country preparedness a nd response, including community outreach and risk communication Total, Monkeypox : $4.5 Natural Disasters The Administration is committed to helping impacted states, Tribes, and Territories recover from recent extreme weather events and natural disasters. We need additional funding that supports the people of Kentucky as they recover and rebuild from recent flooding, as well as communities that have remaining unmet recovery needs as they rebuild from major disasters, including those in Ca lifornia, Louisiana, and Texas. The request also includes funding to address wildfires, droughts, floods, extreme heat, and to increase electric grid resilience. The table below provides more detail on the breakdown of the Administration's request. Natural Disasters Department Funding (billions) Purpose and Description: Homeland Security $2.9 To ensure FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund has sufficient funding to address disaster costs expected to materialize in FY 2022 and FY2023 Agriculture $1.5 To provide direct payments to farmers that experienced crop or livestock losses due to natural disasters like drought and wildfires Housing and Urban Development $1.4 For Community Development Block Grant \u2014Disaster Recovery funding to addr ess the remaining unmet disaster recovery needs for major disaster s during 2021 , including disasters in California, Louisiana, and Texas Energy $0.15 To provide funding to state, local government, and Tribes to increase the resilience of the electric grid , including power outages, through funding for planning and support, conducting rapid risk assessments, and implementing risk mitigation measure to accelerate utilities' response time and ability to protect publi c health and safety HHS $0.5 To provide additional funding for LIHEAP to help mitigate the impacts of extreme heat and support heating needs in the winter season Army Corps $0.05 To provide support for drought planning and response "}
