A prime-boost regimen (administration of two doses) is recommended to induce an adequate and sustained immune response. Most of these vaccines follow a homologous regimen (the same type of vaccine as priming and booster doses). However, there is a growing interest in a heterologous prime-boost vaccination regimen to potentially help address concerns posed by fluctuating vaccine supplies, serious adverse effects (anaphylaxis and thromboembolic episodes following adenovirus-based vaccines), new emerging virulent strains, inadequate immune response in immunocompromised individuals, and waning immunity. Various studies have demonstrated that heterologous prime-boost vaccination may induce comparable or higher antibody (spike protein) titers and a similar reactogenicity profile to the homologous prime-boost regimen. Based on these considerations, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidance supporting the \"mix-and-match\" heterologous boost COVID-19 vaccine strategy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-07-20", "cleaned_text": "Fortunately, multiple safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are now available for public use due to the collaborative effort of the scientific community, the federal government, and pharmaceutical companies. [2](#B2-idr-14-00057), [3](#B3-idr-14-00057)]. In addition, various potential vaccine candidates are under investigation. As of October 2021, there are 107 vaccines in clinical trials on humans (of which 41 have reached the final stages of testing) and at least 75 preclinical vaccines under investigation on animals [ [4](#B4-idr-14-00057)]. [5](#B5-idr-14-00057), [6](#B6-idr-14-00057), [7](#B7-idr-14-00057)]. The primary objective of any immunization regimen is to induce an adequate, long-lasting effect against the pathogen (SARS-CoV-2 virus). Most of these approved vaccines follow a homologous prime-boost regimen (the same type of vaccine is administered as both the priming and booster dose). However, there is growing international interest in the heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine schedule to potentially help address concerns posed by fluctuating vaccine supplies, serious adverse effects (to individuals primed with ChAdOx1 vaccine), new emerging virulent strains, and waning immunity, by providing a robust immune response with a safe reactogenicity profile [ [8](#B8-idr-14-00057), [9](#B9-idr-14-00057), [10](#B10-idr-14-00057), [11](#B11-idr-14-00057), [12](#B12-idr-14-00057), [13](#B13-idr-14-00057)]. Some preliminary findings from COVID-19 vaccine studies and other non-COVID-19 vaccines suggest that a heterologous prime-boost regimen can be more immunogenic than these prime-boost combinations have progressed to clinical trials with promising results. For instance, in studies conducted on vaccines against the Ebola virus, heterologous vaccination produced a robust and sustained elevation of specific immunity without producing any vaccine-related serious adverse events [ [26](#B26-idr-14-00057), [27](#B27-idr-14-00057), [28](#B28-idr-14-00057)]. Importantly, in many vaccines, the heterologous prime-boost is more immunogenic than the homologous prime-boost regimen, although the exact mechanism behind this is not well understood [ [14](#B14-idr-14-00057), [15](#B15-idr-14-00057), [16](#B16-idr-14-00057), [29](#B29-idr-14-00057), [30](#B30-idr-14-00057)]. Some studies have suggested that priming with a DNA-based vaccine may improve the avidity of the antibody response to a protein-based vaccine [ [31](#B31-idr-14-00057), [32](#B32-idr-14-00057)]. It is hypothesized that in vivo production of antigens by DNA or mRNA-based vaccines may lead to the production of memory B cells specific for the conformational domains of the antigen [ [5](#B5-idr-14-00057)]. Supportive evidence was reported by Vaine et al. in a rabbit model [ [33](#B33-idr-14-00057)]. They demonstrated the presence of conformational sensitive antibodies following priming by a DNA-based vaccine (for in vivo delivery of HIV-1 gp120 antigen). [13](#B13-idr-14-00057)]. Findings from selected studies are summarized in 1](#idr-14-00057-t001). [37](#B37-idr-14-00057), [38](#B38-idr-14-00057), [39](#B39-idr-14-00057)]. Due to this life-threatening side-effect, health authorities were forced to modify immunization guidelines, including administration of the heterologous vaccine booster BNT162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech) in people who had received ChAdOx1-S as the primary dose [ [22](#B22-idr-14-00057)]. Data from animal studies on COVID-19 vaccine heterologous prime-boost have shown robust immune response with increased SARS-CoV-2 IgG specific titers with neutralization ability and a robust T-helper-1-type response on either ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2 as prime or booster doses [ [22](#B22-idr-14-00057), [40](#B40-idr-14-00057)]. Human data on COVID-19 heterologous prime-boost are trickling in following the adoption of heterologous regimens in the US and several European countries. 2.1. Sputnik V [5](#B5-idr-14-00057), [41](#B41-idr-14-00057), [42](#B42-idr-14-00057), [43](#B43-idr-14-00057)]. [34](#B34-idr-14-00057)]. Interim results from the phase 3 trial showed 91.6% efficacy against COVID-19 infection with a good safety profile in a large cohort (21,977 adults: vaccine group (n = 16,501), placebo group (n = 5476)). The most common adverse events were flu-like illness, injection site reactions, headache, and asthenia. Most of the reported adverse events (7485 (94.0%)) were grade 1; 451 (5.66%) were grade 2, and 30 (0.38%) were grade 3. In total, 68 participants (45 in the vaccine group; 23 in the placebo group) reported serious adverse events. However, none of the serious adverse events were associated with vaccination, which was confirmed by the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) [ [34](#B34-idr-14-00057), [35](#B35-idr-14-00057)]. [44](#B44-idr-14-00057), [45](#B45-idr-14-00057)]. 2.2. ChAdOx1-S (Prime) and BNT162b2 (Booster) Regimen [10](#B10-idr-14-00057)]. For instance, the British government recommends individuals under 40 years of age should receive a COVID-19 vaccine other than the Janssen vaccine. In addition, countries are now recommending that individuals who have been primed with an adenovirus vector-based vaccine should receive an alternative vaccine as their second booster dose. As a result, many people have received a heterologous prime-boost vaccination with ChAdOx1 as a primer and mRNA vaccines such as the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) [22](#B22-idr-14-00057), [31](#B31-idr-14-00057), [46](#B46-idr-14-00057), [47](#B47-idr-14-00057), [48](#B48-idr-14-00057), [49](#B49-idr-14-00057)]. Early results from some studies suggest that a ChAdOx1 (prime), BNT162b2 (booster) regimen may induce a robust immunological response with a tolerable and BNT162b2 administration varied between 8 to 12 weeks (8 to 9 weeks for 411 (61%) and between 10 to 12 weeks for 263 (39%) participants). They noted that most of the adverse events were mild (n = 1210 (68%)) or moderate (n = 530 (30%)), with injection site pain (n = 395 (88%)), induration (n = 159 (35%)), headache (n = 199 (44%)), and myalgia (n = 194 (43%)) as the most reported adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported [ [10](#B10-idr-14-00057)]. In the analysis of humoral immune response (titer of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S) in the vaccine group (on day 0 and day 14 after dose two), the GMT of antibody titers increased from 71\u00b746 BAU/mL at baseline (day 0 after dose two) to 7756\u00b768 BAU/mL at day 14 (p < 0.0001)). In the analysis of cellular immune response (IFN- secretion upon SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S restimulation in culture), all participants in the vaccine group (on day 14 after dose two) had significantly higher levels of IFN- (GMT of 521.22 pg/mL) compared with the [30](#B30-idr-14-00057)]. However, such comparative studies are limited to COVID-19 vaccines. In an observational study by Schmidt et al. on 96 adults, the heterologous vaccine regimen induced spike-protein-specific IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and spike-protein-specific CD4+ T cells, the levels of which were significantly higher than after homologous vector vaccine boost (n = 55), and higher or comparable in magnitude to homologous mRNA vaccine regimens (n = 62). In addition, spike-protein-specific CD8+ T cell levels after heterologous vaccination were significantly higher than after both homologous regimens [ [52](#B52-idr-14-00057)]. Similar findings have been seen in larger nationwide cohort studies, which also noted a similar vaccine efficacy (protection) against SARS-CoV-2 infection after heterologous ChAdOx1/mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine prime-boost (79-88%) compared COVID-19 prime-boost (80-90%) [ [53](#B53-idr-14-00057), [54](#B54-idr-14-00057)]. [12](#B12-idr-14-00057)]. While interpreting these findings, it is also important to note that these data were obtained in participants aged 50 years and older, and reactogenicity in the older age group might be higher than in the younger age group [ [55](#B55-idr-14-00057), [56](#B56-idr-14-00057)]. The author also suggested that prophylactic use of paracetamol after immunization may help mitigate these vaccine-related side-effects on data) that both heterologous regimens increased antibody titers 6.2-76-times compared to a 4.2-20-times increase after a homologous regimen. They also noted a similar reactogenicity profile between the groups with site pain, malaise, headache, and myalgia as the most common side effects noted after booster administration. 3. Heterologous Prime-Boost: Where It Might Help [58](#B58-idr-14-00057)]. The use of heterologous booster vaccines with similar reactogenic and immunogenic profiles may help simplify the logistical bottleneck of the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain (fluctuating vaccine supplies). A shortage of vaccine supply might result in delayed administration of the second dose. Therefore, this heterologous prime-boost strategy can help the vulnerable population, especially in low-income countries, get fully vaccinated [ [52](#B52-idr-14-00057), [59](#B59-idr-14-00057)]. [51](#B51-idr-14-00057)]. In a study on 40 transplant recipients, Schmidt et al. reported that heterologous vaccination (ChAdOx1 and mRNA-based) led to higher antibody and CD4 T-cell response compared to a homologous regimen of mRNA-based (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine.
