Medical Drive Salt Lake City, Utah 84132 Same-Day Dermatology is a clinic offered daily at the [University of Utah Hospital](/locations/hospital). You will be seen by a board-certified dermatologist who specializes in urgent care dermatology on the same day you call to schedule an appointment. In order to limit waiting, we ask that you make an appointment before your visit by calling 801-581-2955. Some of the conditions we treat include the following: - bleeding moles, - blisters, - genital sores, - oral sores, - rashes, and - other conditions. Our clinic is the first and only in Utah to offer urgent, same-day appointments for skin care needs. Why Same-Day Dermatology? Skin diseases are complex and can be difficult to diagnose and treat. It's important to choose a dermatologist who has expertise in treating [skin conditions](/dermatology/conditions) so you don't have inappropriate treatments, unnecessary prescriptions, and unwanted or unnecessary side effects. At our same-day dermatology clinic, our specialists offer immediate, same-day care for patients who have the most difficult skin problems. Having a dermatologist evaluate your skin condition early often leads to an earlier diagnosis, the most effective treatment, and better outcomes. Find a Dermatologist Near You Reasons to Visit a Same-Day Dermatology Clinic You may want to make an appointment with our same-day dermatology clinic for the following reasons: Rash From Medications Medications (even over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen) are a common cause of rashes. A dermatologist can help you determine which medications are most likely causing a rash. However, a rash may also be a sign of organ issues in your liver or kidneys. We will be able to identify those types of rashes as well. If you are in the midst of chemotherapy or taking a long-term medication for your mental health, a dermatology visit will sometimes reassure you that a medication doesn't need to be changed. Possible Melanoma [Melanoma](/huntsmancancerinstitute/skin-cancer/melanoma) is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Recognizing it early can dramatically change your health prognosis. Especially since it's possible for melanoma to spread to your organs. If you have a suspicious spot (lesion) on your skin that looks like a melanoma, we will evaluate it immediately and perform a biopsy (take a tissue sample) of it during the same visit, if needed. Blisters Blisters on your skin or your mucosa (such as inside of your mouth or on your genitals) can be caused by many things, including - infections, - medications, and [autoimmune skin diseases](/dermatology/services/autoimmune-skin-diseases)(the result of when your immune system attacks your skin). Our dermatologists have the unique knowledge and experience needed to evaluate blisters. If left untreated, blistering diseases could have dangerous and even life-threatening consequences. Skin Pain When your skin hurts, it is important to learn the cause. The most common causes of skin pain are: - skin infections (like shingles, herpes and impetigo), - abscesses (boils), - or inflamed cysts. All of these conditions will be treated during your appointment. This eliminates the need to visit the emergency room. However, there are dangerous, rare skin diseases (such as [toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome](/burn-center/conditions-treatment/epidermal-necrolysis-syndrome-stevens-johnson-syndrome)) that can cause the skin to shed. This is extremely painful and may lead to in-hospital care. New Rashes If a rash is causing you to lose sleep or miss school or work, it is important to be seen right away. Although not a complete list, some rashes we see are: - hives, - allergic reactions to plants and chemicals, - perioral dermatitis (skin inflammation around your mouth), - fungal and yeast infections, and - rashes from viruses. Long-Term Skin Condition Flare-Ups For eczema or psoriasis flare-ups that aren't responding to your usual treatments, a skin specialist in our same-day dermatology clinic will provide an emergency treatment to get you back on track. We will also collaborate with your regular dermatologist or primary care provider to help continue your care. How to Make an Appointment Please call 801-581-2955 to schedule an appointment.

Life-Threatening Conditions If you have a life-threatening condition, please call 911 or go to the nearest [emergency room](/locations/hospital/emergency-room). The same-day dermatology serves patients whose main health problem is a skin condition.
