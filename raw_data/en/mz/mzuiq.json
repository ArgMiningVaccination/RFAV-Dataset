These \"senescent\" cells have reached a point \u2014 due to damage, stress or just time \u2014 when they stop dividing, but don't die. While senescent cells typically make up only a small fraction of the overall cell population, they accounted for up [to 36 percent of cells](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00481.x)in some organs in aging mice, one study showed. And they don't just sit there quietly. Senescent cells can release a slew of compounds that create a toxic, inflamed environment that primes tissues for chronic illness. Senescent cells have been linked to diabetes, stroke, osteoporosis and several other conditions of aging. These noxious cells, along with the idea that getting rid of them could mitigate chronic illnesses and the discomforts of aging, are getting serious attention. The U.S. National Institutes of Health is investing $125 million in a new research effort, called SenNet, that aims [to identify and map senescent cells](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-program-map-rare-type-non-dividing-cells-implicated-human-health-disease)in the human body as well as in mice over the natural lifespan. And the National Institute on Aging has put up more than $3 million over four years for the [Translational Geroscience Network](https://www.gerosciencenetwork.org/)multicenter team led by Kirkland that is running preliminary clinical trials of potential antiaging treatments. Drugs that kill senescent cells \u2014 called senolytics \u2014 are among the top candidates. Small-scale trials of these are already underway in people with conditions including Alzheimer's, osteoarthritis and kidney disease. \"It's an emerging and incredibly exciting, and maybe even game-changing, area,\" says John Varga, chief of rheumatology at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, who isn't part of the Translational Geroscience Network.
