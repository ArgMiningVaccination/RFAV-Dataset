On 28 September 1995, the Berlin Museum of Ethnology in Berlin-Dahlen opened an exhibition entitled \"Chinese Medicine in Historical Objects and Images.\" Including more than 1,100 items from the ninth through the twentieth centuries, this exhibition displays objects associated with the practice of traditional Chinese medicine. All objects come from the private collection of Paul Unschuld of Munich. The centerpiece of the exhibit is an original Chinese apothecary's shop from the early nineteenth century, surrounded by the many types of instruments and containers used to prepare and dispense drugs. Also shown are instruments used by Chinese physicians to diagnose and treat illnesses, items explaining the close link between Chinese health care and religion, as well as rare examples of medical subjects in Chinese art. A large part of the exhibit was devoted to Chinese medical literature, with an emphasis on private manuscripts and illustrated books. An illustrated catalogue by Paul U. Unschuld was published by Prestel Publishing Company, Munich. After nine months in Berlin, the exhibition will travel to several other German cities and, possibly, abroad. [End Page 119] Brazil.
