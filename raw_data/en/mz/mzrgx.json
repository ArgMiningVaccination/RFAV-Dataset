We use gentle cleansers that have been used for hundreds of years to clean out dirt, oil + buildup while leaving your natural oils intact to nourish and protect your scalp microbiome and hair like it is meant to. It's selecting herbs to use in an herbal hair rinse, or an Apple cider vinegar rinse to infuse essential vitamins and minerals to your follicles for optimal scalp health. Or herbs that have a high mucilage (moisturizing) element to hydrate dry brittle hair. It's important to note that almost all conventional products have silicones in them which buildup on the hair and scalp over time causing a number of issues like dry hair and hair loss. Hair healing is the reversal of that. Once your hair is rid of the toxic buildup then you heal it with natural products that actually hydrate your strands, not suffocate them! Things like aloe, cold pressed oils and hydrosols are a couple key ingredients we use to bring life back to tired hair. You get to have fun with this and create rituals for yourself for fun self care days. It's also about carving out that time to be with yourself and take care of your body. Hair is directly connected to our life force within us which makes it a direct reflection of our internal health, by taking care of your body your taking care of your hair!!
