Religion and spirituality have been linked to improved health outcomes in other medical fields. Our scoping review aimed to examine the available literature for evidence of the impact of spirituality on burns, complex wounds, and critical care to shed more light on the relationship between spirituality and the conditions treated by multidisciplinary burn center teams. We performed three systematic reviews to examine the relationship between spirituality and these conditions. Searches were performed using MeSH terms utilizing four databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus). A systematic and independent title/abstract screening was carried out by two independent reviewers and a full-text review was followed. Our review demonstrated a clear lack of overlap between study outcomes and lack of objective spirituality measurements. Most articles primarily focused on psychological outcomes, such as stress or mental health, instead of objective measures such as wound size or scar formation. We found a trend toward better psychological outcomes in patients with more spirituality, either pre-existing or interventional. To increase comparability and uniformity of outcomes, future studies would benefit from utilizing standardized spiritual assessment tools and objective wound metrics.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-02-24", "cleaned_text": "Spiritual Healing: A Triple Scoping Review of the Impact of Spirituality on Burn Injuries, Wounds, and Critical Care [https://doi.org/10.3390/ebj3010016](https://doi.org/10.3390/ebj3010016) [Psychosocial Aspects of Burn Care, from Religion and spirituality have been recognized as significant contributing factors to health by numerous studies [ [1](#B1-ebj-03-00016)], with empirical evidence suggesting that people with higher levels of spirituality have lower levels of depression, improved quality of life, and higher pain tolerance [ [2](#B2-ebj-03-00016)]. [3](#B3-ebj-03-00016)]. Religion is often viewed as more institutionalized, involves accountability, and is deeply rooted in tradition while spirituality is more personal and requires fewer obligations. Spirituality is an individual's attempt to finding meaning in life and a sense of involvement with transcendence [ [4](#B4-ebj-03-00016)]. [5](#B5-ebj-03-00016)]. The specialized burn center teams that treat these injuries are also skilled to treat other complex non-burn wounds. There is substantial evidence that psychological stress adversely affects the immune system. Any form and level of stress can have significant consequences for wound healing [ [6](#B6-ebj-03-00016)], and empirical evidence shows that wound healing may take significantly longer for individuals who are stressed [ [7](#B7-ebj-03-00016)]. Additionally, delayed healing is associated with elevated anxiety and depression [ [8](#B8-ebj-03-00016)]. Considering the substantial level of evidence showing that negative psychological and emotional states have detrimental impacts on the process of wound healing and immune recovery, we aimed to understand the role that spirituality plays in mitigating these deleterious repercussions. 2. Materials and Methods [http://www.prisma-statement.org/Extensions/ScopingReviews](http://www.prisma-statement.org/Extensions/ScopingReviews)) (accessed on 23 February 2022), and we did not register our search protocol before this publication. We performed three systematic reviews to examine the relationship between spirituality and each of the three injury classes: burns, wounds, and critical care. The intention was to prepare reports first from each of the three systematic reviews separately and then synthesize findings altogether. However, due to the limited literature regarding this specific topic area, there was insufficient empirical data available for quantitative synthesis. As such, we report the studies' findings from the individual systematic reviews as the authors have published them and synthesized them based on how spirituality was determined and what outcome was assessed. 2.1. Eligibility Criteria [Table 1](#ebj-03-00016-t001)). Spirituality services had to be provided for these patients; we did not limit spirituality to religion\u2014any study that aimed to assess spirituality, religious or otherwise, along with the above-mentioned concepts was deemed eligible for review. No comparisons were made between the three observation groups due to the limited quantitative evidence available. We observed the different surgical procedures, the type and size of the injuries sustained, and the different reasons for critical care services. Outcomes measured were length of stay, injury location, hospital-acquired complications, mortality. Study designs considered were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials, retrospective studies, observational studies, prospective studies, case-control studies, cohort studies, and surveys. There was no predetermined length of participant follow-up. Studies were excluded if they were not in English; were published before the year 2000; were review articles without new academic contribution, non-reviewed peer literature, case reports, editorial articles, unavailable full-text; or patient death occurred before hospital admission. 2.2. Information Sources [Supplementary Material S1](#app1-ebj-03-00016). A list of references for relevant articles was compiled and hand-searched to identify additional applicable studies. All references were imported into Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) reference management software for proper data extraction and removal of duplicate articles. 2.3. Selection of Sources and Evidence 2.4. Synthesis of Results 2.5. Analysis Discrepancies 3. Results 3.1. Selection of Sources of Evidence 3.1.1. Spirituality and Burn Wounds [Figure 1](#ebj-03-00016-f001)a). The 10 studies involved 1080 burn patients and were published between 2002 and 2020. The studies included prospective and retrospective cohort research designs along with clinical trials and case series. 3.1.2. Spirituality and Non-Burn Wounds [Figure 1](#ebj-03-00016-f001)b). The two studies involved 51 patients with non-burn wounds and were published between 2004 and 2020. The studies contained retrospective research only. 3.1.3. Spirituality and Critical Care [Figure 1](#ebj-03-00016-f001)c). The two studies involved 125 patients treated in the intensive care unit from non-wound and non-burn conditions which were published between 2017 and 2019. The studies included both prospective and retrospective research designs. 3.2. Combined Study Outcomes 3.2.1. Spirituality and Burn Wounds [Table 2](#ebj-03-00016-t002)). Additionally, most studies observed how spirituality impacts psychological and psychosocial recovery from burn injuries, rather than objective wound recovery metrics such was epithelization, wound size, discoloration, or scar formation. Two case series with similar spirituality assessments that focused on belief in a higher power or religious affiliation that was present before or after injury found improved resilience in patients with spiritual orientation [ [9](#B9-ebj-03-00016), [10](#B10-ebj-03-00016)]. The improved resilience was noted to allow patients' better coping abilities with their post-injury lives. Providing a similar assessment, Ajoudani and colleagues found improved post-traumatic growth with patients that had a higher spirituality score [ [11](#B11-ebj-03-00016)]. We encountered two studies that assessed the relationship between spirituality and pain in burn patients. Dauber and colleagues performed a survey study with spirituality defined as a belief in \"God\" or practicing yoga which was correlated to improved pain. Similarly, Keivan and colleagues performed a RCT with controlled spiritual care sessions which resulted in improved pain scores and better reported pain control [ [12](#B12-ebj-03-00016), [13](#B13-ebj-03-00016)]. Nasiri and colleagues also reported reduced anxiety for these patients, a similar finding to those of Jibeen and colleagues who reported less psychological distress for patients with a higher Spiritual Transcendence Index [ [14](#B14-ebj-03-00016), [15](#B15-ebj-03-00016)]. Yoga was also mentioned as a form of spirituality that resulted in improved quality of life, self-esteem, and body image by two studies [ [16](#B16-ebj-03-00016), [17](#B17-ebj-03-00016)]. Hultman and colleagues found that patients with worse injury characteristics, such as higher %TBSA, a greater number of hospital-acquired complications, or a longer hospital stay, required significantly more chaplain visits but also found slightly lower, yet not statistically significant, mortality for patients with a religious affiliation [ [18](#B18-ebj-03-00016)]. 3.2.2. Spirituality and Non-Burn Wounds [19](#B19-ebj-03-00016)]. A second study assessed the relationship between spirituality and religiosity and coping with sports injuries, which were defined as any injury sustained during physical activity that impaired said activity [ [20](#B20-ebj-03-00016)]. Consistent with the findings of studies involving burns, religiosity and spirituality were noted to have a positive impact on coping efforts and injury management. 3.2.3. Spirituality and Critical Care [21](#B21-ebj-03-00016)]. While the direct relationship between spirituality and patient status was not directly assessed in their study, Swinton et al. reported on the importance of spirituality for the clinicians and family members [ [22](#B22-ebj-03-00016)]. 4. Discussion [23](#B23-ebj-03-00016)]. From a historical perspective, this relationship to religion holds true but the definition of spirituality has evolved in recent times [ [24](#B24-ebj-03-00016)]. In 2012, the International Consensus Conference defined spirituality as \"a dynamic and intrinsic aspect of humanity through which persons seek ultimate meaning, purpose, and transcendence, and experience relationship to self, family, others, community, society, nature, and the significant or sacred\" [ [25](#B25-ebj-03-00016)]. In medicine, spirituality or spiritual intervention have no clear definition, which carries a limitation for this review and future studies. Spirituality has been critically assessed in medical literature, particularly in the fields of oncology and palliative care [ [26](#B26-ebj-03-00016), [27](#B27-ebj-03-00016)]. However, there is a lack of appropriate literature that examines the relationship between spirituality to burn injuries, non-burn wounds, and critical care. We set out to analyze the impact of spirituality on burn wound healing. [28](#B28-ebj-03-00016), [29](#B29-ebj-03-00016), [30](#B30-ebj-03-00016)]. One paper suggested five potential mechanisms behind the salutogenic impact of faith on healing: \"behavioral/conative\"\u2014faith as a facilitator for healthy behavior; \"interpersonal\"\u2014faith as for support systems; \"cognitive\"\u2014establishing a mental framework; \"affective\"\u2014provoking soothing emotions to combat stress; \"psychophysiological\"\u2014providing a hopeful future to allow the current burden to be tolerated [ [31](#B31-ebj-03-00016)]. In our review, we also found an illustrative case report that suggested nurses integrate spirituality into their treatment of patients to provide more holistic care in the intensive care unit [ [32](#B32-ebj-03-00016)]. Though these theories and approaches may not demonstrate any direct evidence of the influence of spirituality on objective burn or wound outcomes, we see that spirituality improves psychological stress, which may potentially alleviate negative impacts of stress on the immune response. [12](#B12-ebj-03-00016), [16](#B16-ebj-03-00016), [17](#B17-ebj-03-00016)]. However, a RCT on surgical breast cancer patients reported significantly improved quantitative clinical outcomes in patients practicing yoga [ [33](#B33-ebj-03-00016)]. Though the literature defines yoga as a spiritual practice, yoga requires some level of physical fitness and activity. As such, it is impossible to differentiate if the improved outcomes in this reported study are due to spiritual or physical exercises. [34](#B34-ebj-03-00016), [35](#B35-ebj-03-00016)]. It has been suggested that spirituality can help patients manage their recovery more effectively [ [36](#B36-ebj-03-00016), [37](#B37-ebj-03-00016)], and our results from this scoping review support a beneficial relationship between spirituality and, at the very least, the psychological symptoms associated with burn injuries.
