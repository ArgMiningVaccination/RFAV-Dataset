It provides an overview only. It is not intended to be a complete description or to replace reading the statute and regulations or seeking advice from a lawyer. Amendments may be made to the legislation or to the regulations after the publication of this guide; therefore, it is important to refer to the most recent official version of the legislation which can be found on the Nova Scotia government website. What the Health Protection Act is / does The Health Protection Act provides the legal framework enabling public health officials to protect the public and to prevent, detect, manage, and contain health threats without unduly interfering with civil rights and liberties deals with notifiable diseases or conditions, communicable diseases, health hazards, public health emergencies, and food safety lays out the duties and responsibilities of public health officials and of the ministers responsible is consistent with the health protection aspects of public health legislation in other provinces and territories accords sufficient weight to ethical values especially individual liberty, protection of the public from harm, reciprocity, and privacy and confidentiality of health information. What the Health Protection Act does not do The Health Protection Act does not deal with health promotion or other public health functions provide a structure for the public health system cover all health hazards. There are many hazards to human health including occupational health and safety issues that are dealt with by other government departments including federal departments and agencies in addition to the provincial Department of Health Page 4 of 24 Layout of the Act Table 1 shows the format and content of the Health Protection Act (HPA). The main points in the act will be briefly described. Table 1 Format and Content of the Health Protection Act Part Content Section Introduction Name of the Act Purpose Definitions 1 to 3 Part 1 Diseases and Health Hazards Definitions 4 Administration 5 to 17 Health Hazards 18 to 30 Notifiable Diseases or Conditions 31 Communicable Diseases 32 to 52 Public Health Emergencies 53 to 57 Power to Enter 58 to 64 General 65 to 74 Part II Food Safety 75 to 105 Part III General 106 to 119 Regulations At the time of proclamation of the act, there are some new and some existing regulations in force. More will be written so it is important to refer to an appropriate up-to-date source for the latest information. The regulations provide more detail and some of them are referred to, where appropriate, in this guide. Page 5 of 24 CONTENT OF THE HEALTH PROTECTION ACT AND REGULATIONS Introduction (Sections 1 to 3) The formal name of the legislation is \"An Act to Provide for the Protection of Health\". However, the less cumbersome name, the Health Protection Act (HPA), is used for easier reference. Section (2) of the HPA makes a statement emphasizing the balance between individual rights and the public good. Restrictions on private rights and freedoms aris ing as a result of the exercise of any power under this Act shall be no greater than are reasonably required, considering all of the circumstances, to respond to a health hazard, notifiable disease or condition, communicable disease or public health emergency. Definitions appear in various parts of the act. Only select definitions are referred to in this guide, such as \"health hazard\" and \"premises\". Page 6 of 24 Part 1: Diseases and Health Hazards Part 1 of the act falls under the Minister of Health, while the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries is responsible for Part 2. Definitions The term \" institution \" includes a broad range of facilities such as a hospital, child-caring facility, a day care, a school, a correctional facility and a youth custody facility. Of special note, it also includes any place where supervisory or personal care is provided to individuals for compensation. The term \" personal services facility \" is used to describe a place where a tattooist, a barber or hairdresser, a cosmetologist, esthetician, pedicurist, or a person doing body piercing carry out their business. A public health emergency exists when a threat to health is serious and imminent. This threat is related to either a dangerous disease or a health hazard. An example would be a SARS outbreak. Administration Minister of Health The Minister of Health must do a number of things under the act, while other things may be done at the discretion of the minister. The Minister must do the following: appoint staff such as medical officers of health (including the Chief and Deputy Chief), and designate public health nurses and public health inspectors and decide what qualifications, skills, and standards these staff must meet designate these staff with specific authority under the act publish guidelines, standards, and targets for health protection programs and require district health authorities to comply provide an annual report to the legislature on health protection issues report to the legislature on the response to a public health emergency, if one were to occur In addition to the things that the Minister must do as noted above, he or she may also: provide direction to the Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) or to District Health Authorities (DHAs) or institutions regarding notifiable diseases and health hazards enter into agreements with other jurisdictions and organizations establish appropriate public health laboratory services provide a publicly funded immunization pr ogram, including deciding which vaccines and which individuals will be included in the program declare a public health emergency upon the recommendation of the CMOH (see public health emergency section for more details) make recommendations to the Minister responsible for the Emergency Measures Act on issues around public health emergencies that should be included in emergency measures plans required under the act Order a general immunization program in the pr ovince or any part of the province where a public health emergency has been declared for the purpose of preventing the spread of communicable disease. Page 7 of 24 Medical Officers of Health (MOH) The Chief Medical Officer, the Deputy Chief Medica l Officer and medical officers are physicians specifically trained in public health. They have considerable responsibility and authority under the act and are accountable to the Minister. They are commonly known as medical officers of health. Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) The Chief Medical Officer of Health receives direction from the Minister of Health and has the following responsibilities under the act: directs and monitors the work of the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health and medical officers of health carries out epidemiological investigations related to communicable diseases, notifiable diseases, and health hazards develops a surveillance plan for notifiable diseases and conditions develops a communication plan provides the means so that an individual can take specific action to protect the health of the public, which they could not otherwise afford to do orders the control of vectors, which are responsible for transmitting communicable diseases can delegate his or her powers, duties, and functions to other public health staff such as the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, a medical officer, a public health nurse, or a public health inspector Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health (DCMOH) has the power of the Chief Medical Officer of Health when the Chief Medical Officer of Health is not available Medical Officer of Health (MOH) directs the public health nurse and public health inspector when they are assisting him or her in enforcing the act and regulations assesses risks to the health of the public, may investigate potential risks to public health and take steps to decrease or eliminate the risk take reasonable action to protect public health anywhere in the province where there may be a risk, including issuing public advisor ies or bulletins - the medical officer of health must inform the Minister or the Deputy Minister either before taking action or as soon as possible after taking action Information MOHs require a broad range of information in order to investigate/assess and prevent risks to public health. A MOH may access or order data or records from all possible sources including other government departments, other levels of government, NGOs, hospitals, and Canadian Blood Services. The information received by a MOH or a public health nurse or a public health inspector in the course of their work in its broadest sense must be carefully safeguarded. The Confidentiality Regulations provide detail related to how the confidentiality of information is to be maintained. They define business and personal information and make it clear that the MOH must keep personal and business information that they receive by authority of the act in a secure location with access only by the MOH or staff authorized by the MOH. Page 8 of 24 There are some of exceptions to the points noted above: The CMOH may share information with other jurisdictions or parties when it is necessary to fulfill his or her duties. However, the Confidentiality Regulations require the CMOH to enter into an agreement with the other party so that the information is not further disclosed without the consent of the CMOH. A MOH may publicly release the identity of a person with a communicable disease as a last resort to protect public health. Information may be provided in court, etc., if the Minister directs. Where ordered by a Supreme Court Judge in a public inquiry Health Hazards A health hazard is defined as follows. It includes physical hazards such as substances, radiation, noise, vibration, and heat as well as the condition of premises. It also includes a broad range of hazards such as some plants, animals, and organisms (e.g., bacteria and viruses). In addition, an activity, such as tattooing, could be classified as a hazard if not conducted according to standards. The term \"health hazard\" has purposefully been left non-specific in order to cover a broad range of threats to health, both those currently known as well as those yet unknown. The HPA lays out how health hazards are dealt with in a generic way. The Health Hazard Regulations provide more detail. The contents of both the act and regulations are described below. In addition, there is regulation-making power for dealing with health hazards in specific settings, such as swimming pools and tattoo parlours. The act allows for some specific health hazards to be made reportable to the MOH. The MOH can ask for reports in writing and may require the person who is felt to be responsible for a potential health hazard to provide information as part of the investigation that the MOH carries out. After reviewing the report and other information, the MOH may decide that a health hazard does not exist. The reporting person will be informed of this decision. If the MOH feels a health hazard or potential health hazard exists, he or she may conduct a risk assessment. This will be followed up with a management plan and a communication plan. If the issue is one in which another government department or jurisdiction has authority, then the MOH will refer the matter to the appropriate authority. If the MOH believes that a health hazard exists and an order is necessary to deal with the health hazard, he or she may make an order. The order may be made against a person who owns or occupies a premises, or appears to be responsible for a health hazard. It is important to note that voluntary compliance is pursued before an order is written. Orders may be wide ranging. Examples may include; ordering a premise vacated, removing a health hazard, or regulating the use of a premise. The action given in the order must be necessary to decrease the effect of or eliminate the health hazard. Page 9 of 24 If a health hazard exists and the management pl an is not being followed, then the MOH can write an order that contains specific instructions or requirements for dealing with the health hazard. If the order is not carried out the MOH can make arrangements to have the terms of the order carried out and may recover the costs from the person responsible. A public health inspector has the same authority as a MOH to issue an order if a serious health hazard is identified and an order is necessary to deal with it and a MOH cannot be reached for direction. The order must be for the minimum action required to deal with the threat to public health and the MOH must be notified as soon as possible. Any order may be appealed to the Minister within 10 days. The Minister's decision can then be appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Notifiable Diseases or Conditions The Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Conditons Regulation lists the specific diseases or conditions that must be reported to a MOH. These include communicable diseases such as measles dangerous diseases, which are a subset of communicable diseases and include Ebola, Lassa fever, Plague, Smallpox, SARS, Tuberculosis, other viral hemorrhagic fevers, and influenza virus of pandemic potential conditions that are of public health importance, such as vaccine-associated adverse events There are several different groups of people who are required to report cases of notifiable disease to the MOH. The belief that a person may have a notifiable disease may come about either through examining the patient, a lab test, a biopsy or autopsy. Persons required to report include physicians registered nurses medical laboratory technologists principal of a public school or operator of a private school administrator of an institution including Day Cares, universities and community colleges employees of Canadian Blood Services In addition, physicians, registered nurses, or adminis trators of institutions are required to report any situation in which a disease is occurring more frequently than would normally be expected or in a rare or unusual form. This is designed to detect outbreaks and emerging infectious diseases. A physician signing a death certificate is also required to report if the person who died had a notifiable disease or condition when they died. In addition, the Deputy Registrar General under the Vital Statistics Act is required to report when a death certificate indicates that the deceased person had a notifiable disease or condition at the time of death. Page 10 of 24 The reporter must provide the demographic, cl inical, personal, and epidemiological details required by the MOH. All the details around reporting are contained in the Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Conditons Regulations and the Nova Scotia Surveillance Guidelines for Notifiable Diseases and Conditions. The report is made to the MOH who is assigned to the area where the reporting person works. The MOH may request copies of class lists, absen tee reports, daily logs, etc., from schools and day cares. There are specific requirements for testing and reporting of HIV infection. These are outlined in the Reporting Requirements for HIV Positive Persons Regulations. These regulations also refer to several guidelines. See Appendix B for the list of guidance documents. Communicable Diseases This section describes how a medical officer of health deals with communicable diseases. The MOH receives reports of either a notifiable disease or a condition reporting requirement or a report of something unusual. He or she must investigate these reports and take steps to control the disease and protect the public health using the Nova Scotia Communicable Disease Manual for guidance. The Chief Medical Officer of Health approves this manual. Meanwhile, the physician reporting a communicable disease must take steps to prevent transmission of the disease while the MOH receives the report and starts the investigation. In addition, if a patient with a communicable disease is non-compliant with treatment, then his or her physician must report this the MOH. As part of his or her investigation, the MOH may require a person associated with spreading a communicable disease to provide information on his or her activities. The MOH may also require anyone with knowledge of the situation to provide information on the suspected sources of the disease and on people who may have been exposed, i.e., contacts. In specific situations if a MOH's recommendations are not followed and a MOH believes that there is a case of a communicable disease or a risk of an outbreak the situation presents a risk to public health and action is required to decrease the risk to the public Then the MOH can write an order requiring a person to: be examined by a physician go into isolation or quarantine place himself under the care and treatment of a physician take steps so as not to expose others to infection including staying away from work or school If the person fails to comply, the MOH may apply to the provincial court. The judge can order the person to be isolated, quarantined, examined, or treated. Police may be called upon to assist if required. A person can be detained for up to four months and then a further order is required. An order can be appealed to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal. Page 11 of 24 If an individual who fails to comply with an order of the MOH is suffering from a dangerous disease and is a significant and imminent threat to public health, the MOH can apprehend and detain the individual for 72 hours while a court order is being sought. The MOH can also write an order that may require other actions such as cleaning and disinfecting premises, destroying something that is associated with a risk of disease transmission, or closing a premise. The MOH may also direct a school principal, a day care administrator and other institutional administrators to refuse a person who has a case of a communicable disease or who has been in contact with a communicable disease from attending the facility. A MOH can also prohibit public gatherings if necessary to prevent transmission of a communicable disease. If a possible outbreak is identified, the MOH must investigate and take steps to manage the outbreak. This may include advising others of the necessary measures required to prevent further illness. As part of the investigation process, the MOH may require a laboratory to transmit specimens to a public health laboratory for further analysis. To prevent communicable disease, the Minister can order an immunization program. The MOH also directs the handling of the body of a person who died of a dangerous disease to protect others from infection. In general, no body can be disinterred, transported, and reburied without the permission of the Attorney General or the MOH. Burial regulations (in development) and the document entitled Guidance for Handling Human Remains with Communicable Diseases will provide more information for funeral directors and public health officials on this topic. Public Health Emergency In the act, a public health emergency is defined as an imminent and serious threat to public health that is posed by a dangerous disease or health hazard. It is important to note that under the act a dangerous disease includes: Ebola Lassa fever Plague Smallpox Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Tuberculosis Or any other communicable disease designated as a dangerous disease under the regulations, e.g., influenza virus of pandemic potential The Chief Medical Officer of Health is responsible to assess whether or not a public health emergency exists. If he or she believes a public health emergency exists and that special measures are required to respond to the public health emergency, then the CMOH recommends to the Minister that a public health emergency be declared in all of the province or only part of Page 12 of 24 the province. This declaration then allows the CMOH to implement special measures. These measures might include (but are not limited to): implementing an immunization program; note that there is no ability to implement mandatory immunization in Nova Scotia even in a public health emergency setting priorities for which individuals or groups should receive active and passive immunizing agents (i.e. vaccines and immune globulins), drugs, medical supplies or equipment closing a public place such as a school or other place where the public gathers limiting access to certain parts of the province evacuating people from a certain part of the province installing facilities or other relevant construction work including sanitary facilities procuring first right, at a reasonable cost, to active and passive immunizing agents, drugs, medical supplies, equipment from any organization or corporation and confiscating the items if needed from wholesalers, District Health Authorities, and pharmacies, physicians, institutions, etc. In addition to the above list, the CMOH can take any other measure he or she reasonably believes is necessary. When the CMOH believes the public health emergency is over, he or she advises the Minister who then declares it over. The Minister may order that a premise be used as an isolation or quarantine facility. If the owner does not co-operate, a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia can order that a peace officer ensure the premise is in the possession of the Minister or his or her designate. When the Minister no longer requires the premise, he or she will ensure it is cleansed and disinfected and restored to the same state as before he or she took possession. The owner will be compensated. The Minister can assist individuals with the cost of complying with special measures required during a public health emergency. During a public health emergency, a MOH may do what is reasonably required to deal with the public health emergency. This includes entering a dwelling without a warrant (See also Power of Entry section). Note that the Minister may make recommendations to the Minister responsible for the Emergency Measures Act about public health issues that should be included in emergency measures plans required under the act. Power to Enter To investigate potential health hazards and communicable diseases and to administer or determine compliance with the act or regulations, a MOH may need to enter a premise or a dwelling. Note the distinction between a premise and a dwelling . A premise includes lands, structures, and conveyances but does not include a dw elling, which is where people live. Page 13 of 24 Entering a premise A MOH can enter a premise at any reasonable time. Once inside he or she can do a number of things such as inspect, examine, analyze, test, take samples, collect information, take pictures, use machinery, excavate, etc. He or she can also require a person to provide information, or records including personal information, personal health information and proprietary or business information. If the owner or occupier of the premises is not co-operative or cannot be located, the MOH can seek a warrant from a justice of the peace who can consider the request even if the owner isn't present or has not received notice of the request. The justice of the peace can then issue a warrant so that the necessary actions can occur. The warrant can be carried out by the MOH, public health inspector, public health nurse, or any person acting under the direction of the MOH. They can call upon police officers to assist them. Entering a dwelling A MOH may enter and inspect a dwelling with the consent of the owner or occupier of the dwelling. If entry is refused, the owner is absent, or the dwelling is unoccupied, the MOH may seek a warrant in the same manner as for a premises. During a public health emergency A MOH may enter a dwelling without a warrant and take such action as he or she believes necessary to deal with a public health emergency. Role of the public health inspector A public health inspector has the same power as a MOH: to enter premises (other than a dwelling) at a reasonable time enter a dwelling with permission carry out a number of functions such as inspection, examination etc. apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant act under a warrant In a public health emergency, the public health inspector also has the same power as a MOH, if the MOH has authorized the public health inspector or the public health inspector believes the action is necessary and he cannot locate a MOH to enter and inspect premises and dwellings at any time without a warrant take such actions as he believes necessary to prevent, control or deal with a public health emergency Role of the public health nurse Note that a public health nurse does not have all the powers of a public health inspector. A public health nurse has the same power as a MOH to enter any premises other than a dwelling at a reasonable time in order to inspect, investigate, examine, test, analyze, or inquire enter a dwelling with consent require any person to provide personal information including personal health information or business information or to produce records or documents copy the information or take it to copy and retain as evidence Page 14 of 24 Assistance A MOH, public health nurse, or public health inspector can ask a police officer for assistance if required. General This part of the act deals with some specific legal issues including: designation and certificates from an analyst penalties for offences under the act prohibiting the sale of vaccines and immune globulins that are provided free of charge regulation-making powers Page 15 of 24 Part II: Food Safety Part ll of the Health Protection Act deals with food safety. This part is the responsibility of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries rather than the Minister of Health. The Minister has the authority to delegate the responsibility for food safety activities to an Administrator and inspectors. The Administrator must hold a Certified Public Health Inspector designation from the Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors. The Administrator is responsible for issuing permits and also has the authority to suspend or revoke a food establishment permit. There are typically four conditions under which the Administrator may revoke or suspend a permit. These are: a. Past conduct of the applicant gives reason that the future operation of a food establishment wouldn't be in adherence to the regulation. b. The applicant does not or will not have the proper facility and equipment needed to operate a food establishment. c. The applicant is not complying or can not comply with the regulations. d. The operation of the food establishment is or will be a risk to human health. The Administrator will work very closely with the MOH if a food related health hazard exists or may exist. Any applicant has the right of appeal to the Minister if the Administrator refuses to grant a permit or has suspended or revoked a permit. The Administrator may designate classes of food establishments that require permits. Typical classes are for restaurants, grocery stores, temporary food services events and mobile food establishments. This Part also identifies that food establishments must be constructed and maintained so that no conditions exist that may put human health at risk. The Act also requires that food establishments have appropriate maintenance, cleaning and sanitation programs to prevent contamination. These are specific regulations concerning the sale of food, requiring that unwholesome, stale or decayed food cannot be sold and, if found, that an inspector may seize and destroy foodstuff. This part also makes it illegal for any person with a disease previously identified in the Act and regulations to work in the specific aspect of the food industry. The remainder of this Part addresses administration procedures and processes including the power of entry granted to inspectors and the Administrator, as well as the ability of the government to make many types of regulations respecting the sale and production of food. Page 16 of 24 SUMMARY The Health Protection Act provides Nova Scotians with contemporary public health legislation. It is designed to protect the health of the public while at the same time safeguarding individual rights. The legislation allows public health officials to deal with the known threats to public health and has sufficient flexibility to protect against emerging issues. There is also comprehensive regulation making power.
