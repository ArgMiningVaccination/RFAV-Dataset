Just outside of Winchester, in Twyford, is the Dove Clinic for Integrated Medicine, which has been treating patients with chronic and life threatening illness since 2000. And there is a link between some of the supplements which the Dove Clinic recommends and supplements which are beneficial to athletes. The Dove Clinic doctors use supplements which provide support to the immune system. One of these supplements, ImmiFlex, was the subject of a recent study which investigated the effects of respiratory infections in marathon runners . The study into Wellmune, the 1,3 1,6 beta glucan which is the key ingredient in ImmiFlex, was presented at the American College of Sports Medicine in May of this year. The double-blinded study involved 182 runners who completed the 2011 Livestrong Marathon in Austin, Texas. The participants included 96 men and 86 women with an average age of 34 and an average finish time of 4:00 hours. Participants were given either 250 mg/day of Wellmune soluble, Wellmune dispersible, or a rice flour placebo to take for four weeks following the marathon. Subjects taking Wellmune soluble experienced a 45% reduction in the number of days that they reported both general health problems and URTI symptoms while subjects consuming Wellmune dispersible reported 34% fewer days of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) symptoms, for an average reduction of 40%. These results were statistically significant compared to placebo (p<0.05). \"The study confirms previous clinical research showing that Wellmune WGP's support of the immune system has real health benefits for individuals under physical stress,\" said Rich Mueller, chief executive officer of Biothera, the manufacturer of Wellmune WGP. \"This applies to both elite athletes as well as recreational athletes.\" Continuing the athletic theme, another of the supplements utilized by the clinic to achieve a better PH balance for the body, Basica (in its Sports format), has also been the subject of study for athletes. A 2002 study (Oopik et al) concluded that better performance in a 5km race was achieved by the citrate group when compared to the placebo group.

The use of certain fruit kernels in the treatment of serious ailments, even cancer goes back to the Emperor herbalist Shen Nung in the 28th century BC and \"Bitter almond water\" features in the writings of the physicians of ancient Egypt, Arabia, Rome and Greece and others, who all used preparations made from the seeds of bitter almonds, apricots and peaches. The Hunzas are a cancer-free society in the Himalayas who are known to consume up to 40 kernels as a snack!. They are also regarded as some of the healthiest people in the world. Ernst Krebs PhD, an American biochemist proposed that cancer was a deficiency disease and he identified a missing substance as amygdalin, found in bitter almonds, apricot and peach seeds. As a toxin, amygdalin is in the Class 1 and 2, therefore virtually non-toxic, whereas chemotherapy is in Class 6 - super toxic. Other virtually cancer-free peoples are the Hopi and Navajo tribes who also have an amygdalin rich diet. Naturelle UK imports these apricot kernels direct from the Himalayas, where they grow at altitudes of at least 6,000 ft; no pesticides or fertilisers are used. The fruit is first dried, then the kernels are broken open and the seeds removed. The harvesting and preparation of these apricot seeds brings much needed added income to the local villagers. It is recommended that you take 5-7 seeds spread over a day and more for those suffering from serious conditions, building up the quantity slowly.

I met Sarah at a health event in 2010 where she encouraged me to try her creams. At first I was sceptical. As a Kinesiology practitioner I muscle test for the correct solutions for my clients health issues, if the body doesn't want it, the item won't test. To my surprise the creams tested positively. I bought 18 creams that day and I immediately started to use them in my clinic; my clients loved them. I also recommend that my students add them into their practice, as they simply and effectively balance the electro-magnetic energy fields of the body...\" Claire Snowdon-Darling AAMET ABNLP Cert Ask Health Practitioner and Kinesiology Lecturer With Claire's encouragement, Sarah developed a professional test kit of all the creams, which makes it easy to muscle test clients.

The range is the result of 30 years of research into honey. The researchers discovered that bees feeding on plants with medicinal properties would produce a honey containing healing benefits. Furthermore they realized that when a bee process' nectar into honey the active ingredients present in the feed are intensified, making them more effective and readily absorbed by the body. Each variety of 'functional honey' in the LifeMel range is designed to help different conditions, and is made by feeding bees a specific and unique blend of medicinal plants and herbs. The active ingredients of these powerful botanicals then enter the honey the bees produce, resulting in tailored natural supplements containing the combined health benefits of the individual herbs. There are currently six varieties of these unique beehive supplements available in the UK, including the world famous LifeMel. LifeMel Designed to help boost and support immunity before, during and after chemotherapy. LifeMel is 100% natural and has been shown in a significant percentage of people to improve low white blood cell count. It is produced by honeybees in Israel, which are fed on a specific diet including selected herbs such as Siberian Ginseng, Cats Claw & Echinacea. GastroMel Eases the symptoms of digestive discomfort including IBS, indigestion and stomach aches. GastroMel is also believed to have a natural antibiotic effect which kills the bad helicobacter pylori bacteria which cause stomach ulcers and gastritis - and a higher level of the good bacteria is maintained. GastroMel also contains propolis, the strongest antiseptic found in nature which is believed to help release tight muscles caused by nervous bowels, effectively relieving constipation. The herbs in the feed for the GastroMel bees include Alfalfa, Bay Leaf, Sage, Angelica, Hydrangea and Indian Fig. EnergyMel Designed to boost and maintain energy levels. Gives an all-round boost to those of us leading busy, stressful lives, helping to improve resilience and stamina and prevent fatigue. Also beneficial for people recovering from illness as it helps support and speed up the healing process. The botanicals in the feed for the EnergyMel bees include Panax Ginseng, Broadleaf Plantain (Soldier's Herb), Siberian Ginseng, Scabwort and American Spikenard. RelaxMel Helps to balance the body, stabilise sleep patterns and ease the mind. The bees are fed a special diet of powerful herbs and produce a honey product which incorporates the active ingredients from these herbs which then act to balance the body, calm and balance the nervous system, stabilise sleep patterns and ease the mind of worries and tension. The herbs in the feed for the RelaxMel bees include Passion Flower, Lavender, Oats, Agnus castus and Golden hop. LadyMel Day and LadyMel Night Helps to soothe menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes during the night and day. The bees are fed a diet of healing botanicals designed to soothe the whole spectrum of unpleasant menopausal symptoms - the active ingredients of the plants then enter the honey they produce which combat, amongst other symptoms, hot flushes, restlessness and unease as well as acting to balance hormone levels. The herbs in the feed for the LadyMel bees include Alfalfa, Red Clover, Agnus Castus, German Chamomille, Siberian Ginseng, Peppermint, Purple Passionflower and Common Hop.

Mikao Usui was a devout Buddhist and Master in Martial Arts and was believed to be an allopathic doctor. Reiki was originally devised by him to heal oneself and only after much practice and meditations were you able to heal others. Christine Johnston. Reiki has within its vibrations different bands of resonance. When you reach level 3 in Usui based Reiki you have been attuned to the first vibrational frequency of the Reiki Ray energy. Higher vibrational Reiki frequencies have been discovered and we now describe these in Lightarian Reiki. There are many different styles of Reiki today, many channelled by Reiki Masters, such as Karuna, Shamanic, Tera Mai, etc. Currently Lightarian Reiki frequencies are open to all Reiki Masters. The delivery system for Reiki healing energies is a combination of the basic vibration level of the energy being delivered and the ability of the channel (healer) to handle that level of energy. The quality and clarity of the teacher/practitioner's thoughts and intentions determine one's ability to be an effective channel for the healing energies. Developing this clarity as a 'conduit for energies' is a crucial step along the way towards mastering the use of energies as a Reiki practitioner. As you raise your vibration through Lightarian Reiki and tap into higher and higher aspects of the Reiki energy spectrum\u00b8 you naturally become a clearer and better channel for the Buddhic healing energies. Usui based Reiki is the vibrational frequency base (First band) that initially 'plugs' you into and connects you to the broader spectrum of Reiki Ray energies. After you are attuned to the Usui levels and work with those energies for a while, you may feel compelled to move beyond this introductory stage.** Lightarian Reiki is a system of attunements, each taking you to a higher vibrational level. The first attunement, the Buddhist Boost, brings an Usui Master up to the vibratory level required to start the 'Lightarian Reiki' series of attunements; however this is not necessary for Karuna Reiki Masters as they have already received this band of energy. Lightarian Reiki levels I and II are received in the same attunement, as they occupy the same vibrational frequency band and you also learn the majority of the principles and philosophy of Lightarian Reiki. 30 days are given between each attunement allowing for full integration into one's own energy make up. Levels III and IV are then given in separate attunements, with levels V and VI combined into one further attunement. Throughout this series of attunements a student will deepen their relationship with Ascended Master Buddha, opening to his love and guidance. ** taken from the Lightarian Reiki Handbook Further Information Please contact Christine Johnston via [cjele@easynet.co.uk](mailto:cjele@easynet.co.uk) or John Chate via [johnchate@hotmail.com](mailto:johnchate@hotmail.com) [www.lightarian.com](http://www.lightarian.com/) Elena's Nature Collection Elena's Nature Collection is celebrating 25 years of successfully helping people who may also be prone to eczema or psoriasis.

Further Information Please contact Elena's Nature Collection Ltd Passive Motion Continuous Passive Motion [CPM] equipment has been used by Osteopaths in treating backs since the 1970s, reducing inflammation and easing pain by encouraging the flow of synovial fluid between the discs, supplying nutrients and oxygen to the tissues, and helping to expel toxins that arise from inflammation. CPM utilizes oscillatory motion in a way that mirrors techniques in therapies such as Shiatsu, Trager and the harmonic hands-on work of Osteopaths themselves. These manual techniques aim at releasing tension and inducing relaxation. Research has shown that the high incidence of back pain can be largely attributed to a chronic inability to relax, physically and/or mentally; a rocking motion is known to help synchronize brain waves and calm the nervous system. The Japanese devised a simple machine 20 years ago aimed at replicating this harmonic motion. Designed for home use and focused more on the concept of energy stimulation than the specific back care aspects targeted by the West's sophisticated CPM equipment, these became hugely popular consumer items in Japan and elsewhere in the Far East. The original Japanese model had a relatively fast speed of 145 beats per minute (RPM), and was later marketed in the West under the trade name \"Chi Machine\". Ironically its Western distributors emphasized this high speed as being crucial to the perceived benefits, failing to realize how useful the concept was in relation to back care. The FlexxiCore Passive Exerciser was introduced 10 years ago with the aim of combining the stimulating features of the Japanese devices with a better capacity for providing back care, postural realignment and tension release. The user is lying down, allowing muscles to relax with minimal resistance. All that is required is for the user to 'let go' mentally to the rhythmic sideways motion - easier said than done at higher speeds. Built with a heavy-duty motor that provides a smooth ride and precisely adjustable speeds (including a gentle starting speed of just 80 RPM), the FlexxiCore is suitable for users of all ages and fitness levels. This adaptability has encouraged health professionals in many disciplines to use it with clients, and a series of trials [reported in Positive Health issues [125](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/exercise-and-fitness/benefits-of-the-flexxicore-passive-exerciser-practitioner-trials), [141](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/exercise-and-fitness/clinical-relief-with-use-of-the-flexxicore-exerciser) & [177](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/exercise-and-fitness/supervised-use-of-the-flexxicore-passive-exerciser-in-a-clinic-context)] resulted in a portfolio of case studies demonstrating a diverse range of conditions that respond well to treatment. Whilst the original CPM equipment is practice-based and expensive, the beauty of the FlexxiCore is that the therapeutic benefits are accessible - in terms of price, portability and storage - to ordinary users as well as professionals.
