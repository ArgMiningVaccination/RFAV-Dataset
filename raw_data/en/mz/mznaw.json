With the Lava Stones kept close to your ears, and your ears being so close to your nasal passages, you will smell your oils ALL DAY! Every time you turn your head, put you hair behind your ear, turn a corner, open a door, sit down, stand up, give a hug... you name it, you will smell it! Black lava stones are hand cut, ground and hand wire wrapped to create these unique essential oil diffuser earrings. Available in silver, gold and rose gold and as always hypoallergenic for safe use! These can be used with any essential oils. Simply drop and rub your favorite essential oil onto the stone and enjoy the pleasant aroma for up to a week or more! Due to the nature of our handmade products and naturally occurring substances, no two volcanic lava stones are identical. We match our earrings as closely to \"perfect\" as possible, but please note they will never look identical. "}
