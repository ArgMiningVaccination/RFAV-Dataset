Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. ADJUVANTS to improve the immune response to antigens not provide immunity Not all vaccines use adjuvants , ex : Lived vaccine may cause local & systemic reactions more frequently compared with nonadjuvanted vaccines Aluminum salts : used safely in the United States since the 1930s and remains widely in use vaccines that contain subunit antigens of a cell (eg, hepatitis B vaccine) or toxoids (eg, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids) Redbook 32th adjuvants emulsions : adjuvanted influenza vaccine Deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A & saponin in a liposomal formulation : recombinant zoster vaccine Cytosine-phosphate-guanine Heplisav-B Redbook 32th AAP, 2021-2014 STABILIZERS to help ensure that vaccine potency is not affected by adverse conditions such as heat and abnormal pH during the vaccine manufacturing process or during transport and storage Sugars: lactose or sucrose in H influenzas type b vaccines Amino acids: glycine or monosodium salt of glutamic acid in live attenuated influenza vaccine Proteins : gelatin in MMR , varicella vaccine and some AAP, 2021-2014 PRESERVATIVES multidose vials of vaccines as a safety measure to prevent the growth of microorganisms thimerosal, formaldehyde, and phenol derivatives ANTIBIOTICS As a class of preservatives used during the vaccine manufacturing process to inhibit bacterial growth >> trace amounts can remain in the final product neomycin, gentamicin, and polymyxin B Redbook 32th edition, AAP, 2021-2014 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Common vaccine adverse reactions usually are mild to moderate in severity , no permanent sequelae ocal inflammation after administration of either DTaP, Td, or Tdap vaccines, Fever and rash 1 to 2 weeks after administration of MMR or MMRV vaccines Redbook 32th edition, AAP, 2021-2014 Type of reaction Local vs Systemic reaction Immediate vs Non immediated IgE vs Non IgE Mediated Reactions Immunoglobulin E-Mediated Reactions Estimates of true immediate reactions to vaccines range from 1 in 50 000 doses the DTP vaccine to 0.5 - 1 reaction per million doses for other vaccines Predominantly systemic reaction Start within an hour from vaccination (from a few minutes to 4 hr) John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020 wide range of symptoms affecting the skin and the respiratory and cardiovascular systems Dermatologic: urticaria, flushing, angioedema, pruritus Respiratory: rhinoconjunctivitis (red, watery, itchy eyes, stuffy, runny, itchy nose, sneezing), upper airway edema (change in voice, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, stridor) bronchospasm/asthma (cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tachycardia, palpitations, light-headedness, loss of consciousness (Hypotension or loss of consciousness with pallor and bradycardia is more likely to be related to a vasovagal reaction) Gastrointestinal: cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Anaphylaxis after vaccination : rates adapted from NcNeil et al., 2016. Brighton Collaboration case definition Nilsson L, Vaccination and allergy: EAACI position paper, practical aspects. Pediatric Allergy and Immunology. 2017 Gelatin Animal protein : bovine or porcine origin Stabilizing agent : added to Live & inactivated vaccines gelatin-containing vaccines : MMR , rabies, varicella vaccines, and also earlier in Japanese encephalitis and influenza vaccines A new Japanese encephalitis vaccine does not contain gelatin Gelatin is also a source of alpha-gal McNeil , Vaccine-associated hypersensitivity. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 2018 Nilsson L, Vaccination and allergy: EAACI position paper, practical aspects. Pediatric Allergy and Immunology. 2017 Gelatin and alpha-gal allergy In the southeastern United States, galactose-a-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) sensitivity has emerged as a cause of red meat allergy that is causally linked to bites from the lone star tick Alpha-gal sensitivity often presents with delayed anaphylaxis (3-6 hours) after ingestion of red meat, with lesser degrees of reactivity to milk and gelatin A recent report identified vaccine-induced anaphylaxis associated with alphagal allergy in a 63- year-old patient after receiving varicella zoster virus immunization Gelatin and alpha-gal allergy Stone Jr, Cosby A., et al. , The journal of allergy and clinical immunology. In practice ,2019 Gelatin Negative history of allergy to the ingestion of gelatin >> may not exclude an allergic reaction to gelatin injected with the vaccine Incidence of gelatin allergy among vaccine recipients suffering anaphylactic reactions has been higher in Japan Strong association between gelatin allergy and HLA -DR9 (unique to Asians) John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Children with Gelatin allergy (ingestion) * administer a gelatin-free alternative vaccine if available * Skin testing with gelatin-containing vaccine should be performed prior to vaccination Positive : administered in graded doses under observation Negative : vaccine will be given in the usual manner + observe for at least 30 minutes Zudaire, ,Anales de Pediatr\u00eda (English Edition) 2015 John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Egg Ovalbumin Vaccines cultured in chicken embryo fibroblasts have lower concentrations of egg protein than cultured in embryonic eggs Measles and mumps vaccines Yellow fever vaccine Influenzae vaccine Contamination by culture media in the preparation of vaccines Nilsson L, Vaccination and allergy: EAACI position paper, practical aspects. Pediatric Allergy and Immunology. 2017 MMR vaccine not contain egg proteins capable of triggering an allergic reaction all children ( include anaphylaxis reaction ) : routinely vaccinated Yellow fever vaccine Egg-allergic children, including those who have had anaphylaxis, were successfully vaccinated with yellow fever vaccines with no serious adverse events reported may contain significant amounts of egg proteins evaluated by an allergist or pediatric allergist Negative : usual manner Positive : graded doses in a hospital setting Children with Egg allergy Zudaire, ,Anales de Pediatr\u00eda (English Edition) 2015 Children with Egg allergy Influenzae vaccine may contain traces of ovalbumin Egg allergy: CDC & Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Mild egg allergy : receive any licensed and recommended age-appropriate flu vaccine & no longer need to be observed for 30 minutes Severe egg allergy : under the supervision of a health care provider who is capable of recognizing and managing serious allergic conditions Zudaire, ,Anales de Pediatr\u00eda (English Edition) 2015 Milk Milk proteins : used as growth media in DTaP and Tdap vaccines contain trace (nanogram) quantities of bovine casein rarely cause anaphylaxis Many children with milk allergy tolerate the DTaP and Tdap vaccines Standard practice for DTaP vaccination for all children (including who with milk allergy) is recommended Caution is advised >> administering booster doses in highly sensitive children with milk allergy Some additional observation after vaccination in those with very high levels of milk sensitivity Michael M. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2018 Milk However, should a milk allergic patient suffer an allergic reaction to one of DTaP and Tdap vaccines, the possibility of milk protein contaminating the vaccine should be considered Cholera and tetanus-containing vaccines and perhaps pneumococcal conjugate, oral typhoid, and some conjugated Hib type b and meningococcal vaccines could also contain miniscule amounts of milk protein John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( known as baker's or brewer's yeast ) Residual yeast protein : viral proteins grown in S. cerevisiae Vaccines contain yeast protein, including hepatitis B vaccines (up to 25 mg per dose) and human papillomavirus vaccines (<7 mcg per 0.5 mL dose) Smaller amounts of residual yeast protein : Cholera , pneumococcal conjugate, oral typhoid, and some meningococcal vaccines Very rarely be caused by allergy to S. cerevisiae 1% to 2% of subjects had anti-yeast IgE antibodies before immunization >> no significant rise in IgE after receiving HBV vaccine John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Yeast Yeast associated anaphylaxis after administration of HBV vaccine in sensitized patients appears to be a rare event If the patient has a history of immediate-type allergy to baker's or brewer's yeast and a positive skin test or serum-specific IgE response to S. cerevisiae >> an appropriate precaution is skin testing with yeast containing vaccines Positive : administered in graded doses under observation Negative : vaccine will be given in the usual manner + observe for at least 30 minutes John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Latex Dry natural rubber (DNR) latex /synthetic rubber Vaccine vial stoppers or syringe plunger tips Difficult to elute latex allergen from these molded rubber products Flexible latex products Gloves and balloons from Latex allergen can be easily eluted Allergic reactions to vaccines caused by latex in the packaging are exceedingly rare John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Dreskin et al. World Allergy Organization Journal 2016 Latex Latex allergic patients using non-latex gloves for the injection vaccinated in a latex-free environment prepared to treat unusual allergic conditions and reactions History of latex-precipitated anaphylaxis receive vaccines from vials with nonlatex stoppers Available preparation has a latex stopper >> remove stopper & drawn up directly from the vial without passing the needle through the stopper Available vaccine contains latex in the packaging , Ex : prefilled syringe >> vaccine can still be administered, but the patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes afterward John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020 Dreskin et al. World Allergy Organization Journal 2016 Dextran Used as a medium nutrient or as a stabilizer Implicated in allergic reactions to a particular brand of MMR vaccine previously used in Italy and Brazil The reactions were related to the presence of IgG antibodies to dextran the mechanism was hypothesized to be complement activation and anaphylatoxin release This brand of vaccine has been withdrawn from the market Sampath, Vanitha, et al. \"Vaccines and Allergic reactions: the past, the current COVID19 pandemic, and future perspectives.\" Allergy (2021). Non immunoglobulin E-Mediated Reactions Generally local and confined to the site of infection Minor, self-limited side effects pain, warmth, tenderness, swelling, and erythema Inflammatory respond Develop hour - day after vaccination John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Non immunoglobulin E-Mediated Reactions Mild local reactions : non-specific inflammation due to the injection itself & injection of foreign material Large local reactions : 24- 72 hours after vaccine administration 1/4 of the children , after a fifth dose of DTaP vaccine in four- to five-year-olds secondary to T-cell infiltration are often associated with prolonged and very effective immunity Chronic subcutaneous nodules with itching and eczema : Nonspecific inflammation or irritant reactions usually induced by adjuvants, such as aluminum Serum sickness : Reported after human diploid cell rabies vaccine Onset of symptoms from 2 to 21 days after vaccine administration Arthralgia, fever, and malaise, and urticaria has been a prominent feature. Non immunoglobulin E-Mediated Reactions Thimerosal Additive : bactericidal agent associated with contact allergy and rarely with systemic allergic reactions 50% mercury by weight ( mercury is neurotoxic) Thimerosal has decreased dramatically due to theoretical concerns about cumulative mercury exposure in children Sampath, Vanitha, et al. \"Vaccines and Allergic reactions: the past, the current COVID19 pandemic, and future perspectives.\" Allergy (2021). Thimerosal All vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger in the United States are available in formulations that do not contain thimerosal Some multidose vials of inactivated influenza vaccines contain thimerosal Patch testing can be performed for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis, but this is not helpful in relation to vaccination Contact sensitivity : not a contraindication to receiving vaccines containing them Sampath, Vanitha, et al. \"Vaccines and Allergic reactions: the past, the current COVID19 pandemic, and future perspectives.\" Allergy (2021). Formaldehyde & beta-propiolactone (BPL) used to inactivate viruses during the production of vaccines BPL : BPL altered human albumin contained in the HDCV >> develop an immune complex-like reaction in the 2-21 days that follow BPL to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 : SinoPharm, Sinovac Formaldehyde : reported to aggravate eczematous dermatitis following hepatitis B vaccination Formaldehyde-specific contact dermatitis had also been reported following formaldehyde- containing influenza vaccine hypothesized : introduction of carbonyl groups on antigens by formaldehyde in vaccines profoundly affects its immunogenicity Sampath, Vanitha, et al. \"Vaccines and Allergic reactions: the past, the current COVID19 pandemic, and future perspectives.\" Allergy (2021). Aluminum most common adjuvants used in vaccines Aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate may cause formation of persistent nodules palpable at the injection site Antimicrobials Gentamycin, tetracycline, neomycin, streptomycin, and polymyxin B are used during the production process for vaccines most of these antimicrobials are removed during the purification process, trace amounts may be present in some vaccines antimicrobial agents can cause contact or rarely systemic hypersensitivity reactions trace amounts present in vaccines have not been well documented Dreskin et al. World Allergy Organization Journal (2016) 9:32 retrospective study suspected vaccination granulomas referred to the department of pediatric dermatology in CHI, Crumlin between 2010 and 2018 review medical records including laboratory & radiological investigations Kelly, Eimear, et al, Acta Paediatrica , 2020 Thirteen cases were identified Most presentation : 9 Children >> intense pruritus at the vaccination site Most findings : palpable nodules and lichenification AI Patch testing: Eight of nine children in the series patch tested >> positive Follow-up interview : median symptom duration was 12 (range: 3-120) months 2 Children : Reported recurrence of the lesions on subsequent vaccination Biopsy : nodular lymphoid infiltrate of the al, Acta Paediatrica , 2020 Report Etiology : remains unknown Cumulative aluminum exposure & repeated administration of Al adsorbed vaccines & young age have been cited as risk factor 10 of the children in this series had received three doses of the DTaP- IPV/HiB vaccine prior to symptom onset Contact allergy to Al has been demonstrated in 85%-95% following the development of persistently itchy nodular granulomatous reactions to Al- adsorbed vaccines Kelly, Eimear, et al, Acta Paediatrica , 2020 Non-IgE-mediated Reactions : Specific Vaccines DTP - Seizures, encephalopathy, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (HHE), inconsolable crying - incidence >> conversion from whole-cell to acellular pertussis vaccines - Encephalopathy reactions are a contraindication to further pertussis vaccination Polio OPV : vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) Rotavirus - Intussusception : risk is far outweighed by the benefits of vaccination John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Non-IgE-mediated Reactions : Specific Vaccines Vaccine Reaction Tetanus Arthus reactions : - Intervals shorter than 10 years >> associated with increased rates of Arthus reactions Varicella - Varicella-like lesions (the 4% disease (YEL-AND) vaccine-associated viscerotropic John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Non-IgE-mediated Reactions : Specific Vaccines Vaccine Reaction Influenzae Febrile seizures - simultaneously with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine Narcolepsy : particular brand of an H1N1 influenza vaccine MMR Transient rashes (5%) fever 7 to 12 days after administration (15%) -> increased risk of febrile seizures Thrombocytopenia within 2 months of vaccination MMRV Double risk of febrile seizures only for the first dose of the vaccines Rubella Transient arthralgia due to direct infection of the joints by the virus (15% of adult female vaccine recipients) John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020.

SKIN TESTING WITH VACCINES AND VACCINE CONSTITUENTS Dreskin SC, ICON: allergic reactions to vaccines. World Allergy Organ J. 2016 Vaccine skin tests may cause false (or clinically irrelevant) positive reactions. Thus if skin testing gives a positive reaction, also perform on normal control subjects Vaccine component skin tests Prick tests with commercial extracts of egg, milk, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast Prick test with sugared gelatin (e.g., Jell-O): dissolve 1 teaspoon of gelatin powder in 5 mL of normal saline. Vaccines that contain gelatin Prick test with latex: soak 2 fingers of latex glove or a toy balloon in 5 mL of normal saline Vitro assays for specific IgE antibody to egg, gelatin, latex, milk, and yeast also are commercially available as an alternative or complement to skin testing Approach to a Suspected Immunoglobulin E- Mediated Reaction to a Vaccine John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. History of severe reaction & positive vaccine skin test & fewer than the recommended number of doses already received >> consider measuring level of IgG antibodies to immunizing agent If the measured level is associated with protection from disease, consider withholding additional doses, although magnitude and duration of immunity may be less than if all doses received Pre- immunization testing and immunization in patients who had a suspected previous allergic reaction to a vaccine Nilsson L, Vaccination and allergy: EAACI position paper, practical aspects. Pediatric Allergy and Immunology. 2017 Controversies Regarding Long-term Consequences Of Vaccination Atopy: BCG vaccine : unlikely to be associated with protection against the risk of allergic sensitization and disease DTP & measles vaccine : not increase the risk of allergic disease Overall, the bulk of the evidence >> refute the idea that immunization causes atopy Autism : MMR vaccine , Thimerosal No relationship between MMR vaccine and autism & thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism Autoimmune Diseases : Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, optic neuritis, and transverse myelitis \"evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship.\" John M. Kelso. Middleton 9th edition. 2020. Population-specific considerations for vaccination Population Considerations Healthy (A) Follow routine guidelines/schedule for vaccination. (B) Monitor mRNA vaccine recipients for 15-30 minutes per local guidelines History of food allergies Egg: Proceed with vaccination under supervision. Yeast: Seek allergist evaluation prior to Hepatitis A, B, HPV, DTaP, Meningococcal, Pneumococcal vaccines. Gelatin: Seek allergist evaluation prior to MMR, Zoster, Influenza, Rabies, Yellow fever, Typhoid vaccines. History of immunosuppression (A) Defer live vaccination. (B) Administer vaccine prior to immunosuppression if possible. History of vaccine, drug, or antibiotic allergy (A) Refer to allergist. (B) Identify specific components that may be similar in other vaccines. (C) Graded administration of vaccine/drug after discussion of risks and benefit Summary Mild adverse reactions : self-limited , common Serious complications : rare Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated : related to the immunizing agent , protein constituent >> Skin testing may be helpful Non-IgE-mediated : associated with specific vaccines and may preclude further doses "}
