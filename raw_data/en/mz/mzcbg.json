When the commissary asked her if she knew why she had been called, she responded that she presumed they wanted to know about Beatriz de los \u00c1ngeles, a Mexican Indian woman, who was said to have enchanted and murdered a man named Diego Vellido. Three years earlier, Vellido had told Archuleta that he had a special friendship with Do\u00f1a Beatriz de los \u00c1ngeles. After she gave birth to a baby who died, Vellido beat her up. In retribution, de los \u00c1ngeles gave him a morsel in a pot of milk that caused him to fall ill. Distressed, Vellido demanded that she help him feel better. She prepared a remedy for him, and although he felt better momentarily, he eventually died. De los \u00c1ngeles had a grown daughter named Juana de la Cruz, who\u2014according to Archuleta\u2014also had a lover, Hernando Marquez Sambrano. He was said to have hit de la Cruz out of jealousy and she in turn enchanted him, causing his death. Archuleta's testimony came a few days after all the citizens of the region had been ordered to attend a public ceremony at the Church of San Miguel in Santa F\u00e9. During the ceremony, Fray Esteb\u00e1n de Perea was inaugurated as the Official Commissary of the Inquisition for the region of New Mexico, and Fray Andr\u00e9s Gutierres read an auto de f\u00e9, a document listing all the practices that diverged from Catholicism and that were punishable by the Inquisition. The crimes listed included the use of peyote and other medicinal herbs, engagement in witchcraft and sorcery, practicing Judaism, Lutheranism and other European religions, ownership of prohibited books, blasphemy and bigamy. Anyone guilty of these transgressions should confess before the tribunal, and anyone who knew of anyone else who was guilty should denounce what they knew. I learned about these events when I was researching the involvement of women in healing practices in New Spain during the 17th century. I was interested in exploring the participation of Indigenous women in the maintenance of the physical and emotional wellbeing of New Spanish society during the colonial period. I also wanted to know whether Indigenous beliefs challenged the establishment of Catholicism, and to what extent they shaped the religious imagination of colonial settlers in this context. As I was searching for historical evidence, I came across a body of documents from a tribunal of the Inquisition in New Mexico dated between 1626 and 1632. This was my first encounter with 17th Century Spanish paleography\u2014the type of script used back in the 1630's\u2014, but with the assistance of a historic dictionary, I was able to decipher the text within a few days. The frequency with which accounts of heartbreak, betrayal, and acts of physical violence committed against women appeared in the Inquisitorial record was notable, but more outstanding was the level of impunity enjoyed by the men who harmed women. The story of how Diego Vellido battered Beatriz de los \u00c1ngeles was told as as tangential detail to a broader narrative that demonized Beatriz for seeking to avenge him. When speaking of their own experiences, witnesses used explicit words such the events that led them or those they were accusing to seek revenge against their spouses. In other cases, witnesses spoke of fear of abandonment. In short, all throughout the Inquisitorial record, legal documents from divorce trials and documentation of marital disputes revealed how many women accused their husbands of giving them la mala vida, \"a 'bad life.\" Accounts of infidelity and abandonment, of consistent failure to provide financial support for their wives and children, and of physical and sexual violence reveal a painful and complex panorama for women in the colonial world. Devoid of institutional avenues to defend themselves, colonial women settlers counted on Indigenous women and their knowledge about the natural world to procure different magical remedies, which they hoped would help them solve their marital problems. Such was the case of Petronilla de Zamora, a 33-year-old woman who appeared before the Inquisition the same day as Mar\u00eda de Archuleta. Petronilla de Zamora told the Inquisitors that since her parents married her off at the tender age of eleven and her husband mistreated her, she had to seek advice from one of her servants, an Indian woman, who gave her an herb and told her to chew it and spread it over the doors through which her husband entered. In doing so, her husband would stop mistreating her and would love her well. Zamora put this advice into practice but since it was not fruitful, she threw the herb away. In contrast to Archuleta, who was summoned by the Inquisition, Zamora appeared voluntarily and claimed that she was there to ease her guilty consience as she had just come to the realization that she had committed a grave transgression against the Church. Mar\u00eda de Archuleta and Petronilla de Zamora were two of the nine individuals who appeared before the tribunal less than a week after the Inquisition was officially established in New Mexico. They confessed having used roots, herbs and remedies for different purposes, and denounced those of their neighbors who had done the same. All of them accused Beatriz de los \u00c1ngeles and her daughter Juana de la Cruz of murdering their lovers and of engaging in practices that fell under the category of witchcraft and superstition. The number of witnesses who recounted these types of stories increased over the course of the following months. By November 1631, a total of fifty people had testified before the tribunal. Some of them were summoned while others appeared voluntarily. The Inquisition aimed to ensure the proper practice of Catholicism by policing the intellectual, social, sexual and spiritual worlds of Europeans, criollos, mestizos, mulattos, and Africans. The tribunal of the Holy Office was officially established in New Spain in January 1569 after King Phillip II issued a mandate in Spain. A year and a half later, in August 1570, the King removed Indigenous individuals from the jurisdiction of the Holy Office, which by that time oversaw the spiritual matters of all of New Spain, including the territories of modern-day Philippines, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Indians from different communities continued to be persecuted and coerced into converting to Christianity by different religious and political bodies, but after 1571 the Inquisition did not persecute or punish Indigenous individuals for their heterodoxy. Yet, in their efforts to maintain a Catholic religious order, Inquisitors tracked down Indigenous beliefs and practices that breached daily life, and punished Europeans, criollos, mestizos, mulattos and Africans who engaged with them. The documents I worked with in this investigation do not provide sufficient evidence to unearth the stories of Indigenous women who lived in colonial New Mexico, but they provide some insight into how the Indigenous worldview permeated the worldview of Catholic Europeans, criollos, mestizos, mulattos and Africans. These documents also suggest that women from multiple racial backgrounds and social classes formed networks of solidarity that were sustained by the transmission of Indigenous knowledge. The declaration of Juana S\u00e1nchez, a 35-year-old mulatta who testified on June 22, 1631, exemplifies what these networks were about. The Inquisition summoned S\u00e1nchez one Sunday morning, a day after other women\u2014 including her own sister\u2014had denounced her. During the interrogation, they asked her whether she knew anything about anyone using herbs or roots to recover the affection of their spouses. S\u00e1nchez responded that a few years ago she reached out to a Tewa woman from the village of San Juan and asked her for an herb to make her husband stop mistreating her. S\u00e1nchez' husband was being unfaithful and had battered her on repeated occasions, so she wanted to retaliate. The Tewa woman gave S\u00e1nchez a yellow root and two grains of corn and told her to grind the root and rub the paste onto her husband's chest. This way her husband would stop being unfaithful and his heart would return to him. S\u00e1nchez did so. Then she gave the same advice to her sister and to another woman named Beatriz de Pedraza whose husbands were mistreating them. Beatriz de Pedraza was Spanish or criolla, and Juana's sister was mulatta. Both women had testified the day before, and the S\u00e1nchez testimony corroborated what they had told the Inquisitors. The Tewa woman who provided S\u00e1nchez with this remedy was probably a descendant of Tanos (Tewa) Indians, one of the many groups who had lived in and around the area for thousands of years. Up to the Spanish conquest, the area was called Kua' p'o-oge or O'gha Po'oge, \"The Place,\" in two Tewa dialects from Ohikay Owingeh and Santa Clara. When the Spaniards arrived, there were about 60,000 to 80,000 inhabitants in approximately 100 communities scattered along the Rio Grande, and to the west beyond the border with present day Arizona. Each group was predominantly autonomous and multiple languages were spoken in the area. To the Spanish settlers, the adobe-styled multi-storied dwelling places where the locals lived looked like Spanish pueblos (\"towns\"), so they decided to call the local peoples of the area Pueblo Indians. By 1631, the area's racial and cultural landscape had shifted. The number of independent Indigenous communities had been significantly reduced due to illness and colonization. People from multiple racial backgrounds intermarried, producing children who did not fit into previous racial categories thereby complicating racial hierarchies. And when Europeans, criollos, mestizos, mulattos and Africans migrated to New Mexico from other parts of New Spain, Mexican Indians from different backgrounds, such as Beatriz de los \u00c1ngeles and her daughter Juana de la Cruz came along bringing with them practices and beliefs from their own communities. In fact, several of the people that Esteb\u00e1n de Perea interrogated during his investigation confessed that they used remedies made of peyote, a mind-altering cactus that had been sacred to Mexican Indians for hundreds of years. The idea that the remedy that S\u00e1nchez used on her husband would make his heart return resonates with a specific aspect of the pre-Hispanic worldview of Pueblo Indians. American historian Ram\u00f3n Gutierrez has argued that in pre-Hispanic times, a common belief among the inhabitants of the Rio Grande area was that the well-being of their communities depended on the physical and psychological health of their members. The strength of human beings was believed to reside in their hearts, so sorcerers caused people to fall ill by shooting objects into their bodies and draining their hearts out. Healers helped those who were ill to gain back their hearts by sucking out the objects shot into them by the sorcerer. (When Jesus Came the Corn Mothers Went Away, 1991.) By the time Juana S\u00e1nchez testified before the Inquisition, pre-Hispanic beliefs about illness and well-being had been shaped in a myriad of ways, but her declaration proves that certain themes from spiritual world of local peoples colored the imagination of those who settled in colonial New Mexico. Colonial New Mexico was a world full of contradictions. Christians engaged in non-Catholic practices but also attended mass on a regular basis. They seemed to fear the wrath of God but also experimented with herbs and roots that they believed were magical. Violence against women was common, but so were instances of retaliation. Women created alliances and helped each other, but they also denounced their relatives and neighbors before the authorities. This was a complex society where individuals were full of emotion and passion. Many of the women represented in this body of documents went beyond the servile conformity that was expected of them by daring to engage with forms of knowledge that were foreign to them. In doing so, they seem to have gained a sense of agency and control over their situation even if momentarily. While it is impossible to prove the veracity of the events accounted for in these declarations, the Inquisitorial record suggests that Indigenous beliefs and practices permeated multiple aspects of daily life in colonial New Mexico offering an avenue for non-Indigenous women to retaliate against spousal violence. And while settlers disrupted the world of local peoples with their arrival, the process of transformation was not unidirectional. In their attempts to control the people and the land, their intellectual and imaginative worlds were also vastly transformed.
