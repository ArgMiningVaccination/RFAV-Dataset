This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the lavender oil inhalation on the pain resulting from the pentavalent vaccination. Methods: This clinical trial consisted of two groups: the lavender oil group with 42 infants and the placebo group with 57 infants. The healthy infants without congenital abnormalities in need of pentavalent vaccine also participated in our study. The infants started the lavender oil or placebo aromatherapy one minute before injection. The pain was assessed three times, using the Neonatal Infant pain Scale (NIPS): before vaccination, 15 s, and 5 min after vaccination. Also, the duration of crying was measured in both groups. Results: At baseline, the two groups were similar in relation to the NIPS scores. While, after 5 minutes, the NIPS score was significantly lower in the lavender group. Based on the repeated measures analysis, the NIPS score changed over time totally. However, the two groups were significantly different in relation to the NIPS score over time. The duration of crying was 75.47 (60.675) second in the lavender group and 105.22 (75.739) s in the control group. The statistical test showed a significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: A low concentration of the lavender oil inhalation can reduce the pain and improve soothing in the infants with the pentavalent vaccine injection.
