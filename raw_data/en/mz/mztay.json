Notes: All data are based on approved petitions during the fiscal year. Petitions approved in a fiscal year may be filed in previous fiscal years. Per USCIS best practices, units of less than 10 beneficiaries are masked so as to limit the possibility of the de-anonymization of data. \"D\" represents data withheld to protect privacy. While some company names may appear multiple times, USCIS does not combine companies even where the names are the same because in all cases the employer tax identification numbers are different. Missing Education means the education field is not captured by the USCIS electronic data storage system. Average salary is based on data reported by the petitioner in the petition and may include part-time employment. Because USCIS data systems do not include hours worked, we are unable to identify salaries earned from part-time employment. In lieu of the required degree a beneficiary may qualify based on a combination of education, training, and/or progressively responsible experience in the specialty that is equivalent to the completion of such a degree, and recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively responsible positions directly related to the specialty. The letter H replaces the value in the total column where one could deduce the value of D. Employers without tax identification numbers in our system were excluded.
