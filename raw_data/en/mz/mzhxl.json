Up to a third don't respond to several attempts at treatment. Eating Disorder Anorexia, Bulimia, Binge Eating Disturbed eating is one of the most lethal psychiatric disorders that can be managed with proper treatment.

Schizophrenia & Psychosis Schizophrenia, Hallucinations, Delusions, Paranoia Seeking psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia and psychotic and disturbed thinking is daunting for most people. Our goal is to make this process as easy, helpful, and educational as possible.
