The country hopes to roll out five different vaccines \u2014 up to 22 million doses total \u2014 in the future, provided they are proven safe and effective by regulators. So far, three vaccine producers have reported their vaccines are effective via press release, but regulators will assess the data further. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has applications from two producers. It will make a decision on a [vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer by December 29](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-regulator-coronavirus-vaccine-decision-will-come-by-late-december/), and on another from Moderna by January 12. The announcement \u2014 which comes a day after Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said distribution will start January 5 \u2014 lays out six groups, vaccinated over three phases, in order of priority. During the first phase, a very limited amount of vaccines will be available to residents and staff of care homes and health care professionals. 600,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab will go to 300,000 people, since two doses are necessary per person. Under the second phase, when more vaccines with easier storage requirements are ready, people over 65; at-risk patients between 45 and 65; and people with essential social and/or economic functions will get their dose. The last phase of the plan, targeting other at-risk patients and the rest of the adult population, can start when there's a sufficient supply of vaccines available. Still, it's likely that the majority of citizens won't get the jab before the summer, warned Dirk Ramaeckers, the head of the Belgian vaccination task force. The five vaccines that the country will purchase are from AstraZeneca/Oxford; Johnson & Johnson; Pfizer/BioNTech; CureVac; and Moderna, all following deals inked by the European Commission. Belgium doesn't appear to have purchased a sixth vaccine, developed by Sanofi, that also has an initial contract with the Commission, [according to the Belgian medicines agency](https://www.afmps.be/fr/humain/medicaments/medicaments/covid_19/vaccins). CLARIFICATION: This article was updated on December 7 to clarify that the five vaccines are yet to receive regulatory approval in the EU. "}
