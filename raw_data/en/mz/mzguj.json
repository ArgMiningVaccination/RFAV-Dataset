This project has resulted in the development of a [WA Alterations and Additions Protocol for Energy Efficiency (the protocol)](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/wa_alterations_additions_protocol_for_energy_efficiency_10_nov_2014.pdf). [The Protocol](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/alterations-additions-protocol-for-energy-efficiency-final_2.pdf) is an alternative solution that satisfies the Building Code of Australia's energy efficiency requirements for alterations and additions in Class 1 and Class 10 buildings. The resources below will be needed for calculations and verifying compliance. Resources - [HERS & SERVICE Compliance Report & DATASHEET](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/1hersandserviceoct_2014.xlsx) - 20 October 2014 [HERS & SERVICE Compliance Report & DATASHEET](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/1hersandservice.xlsx) - 9 October 2014 Provides a report and automates calculations needed to verify building work compliance with the HERS and SERVICES options of the protocol. - [EP & SERVICES Compliance Report & DATASHEETS](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/glazingcalc_2013_voltwo_excel2010_v2-04_wa_altsadds_ep_v25_jun_2015.xlsx) - 25 June 2015 [EP & SERVICES Compliance Report & DATASHEETS](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2glazingcalcmay15.xlsx) - May 2015 [EP & SERVICES Compliance Report & DATASHEETS ](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2glazingcalcfeb15.xlsx)- 13 February 2015 [EP & SERVICES Compliance Report & DATASHEETS](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2glazingcalc.xlsx) - 9 October 2014 Provides a report and automates calculations needed to verify building work compliance with the EP and SERVICES options of the protocol. - [EP Lite DATASHEET](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/3eplitefeb15.xlsx) - 7 February 2015 [EP Lite DATASHEET](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/3eplite.xlsx) - 28 May 2014 When the EP option is used and the building work is done on more than one storey, this calculator can be used to verify glazing and air movement compliance for additional storeys. - [Ceiling Penetration & Artificial lighting CALCULATOR](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/inspen_artlight_calc_v25_jun_2015.xlsx) - 25 June 2015 [Ceiling Penetration & Artificial lighting CALCULATOR](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/4ceiling_0.xlsx) - 28 May 2014 For both the HERS and EP Compliance Reports, the percentage of uninsulated ceiling area and artificial lighting wattage are nominated as a maximum allowance. This calculator can be used to check that the nominated maximum allowances are not exceeded. Notes - Resources are provided in Excel 2010.This file will open in Excel 2007, Excel 2013 and MacExcel 2010. - EP & SERVICES and EP Lite resources have been added to the \"worksheet\" of a WA-only version of the ABCB Glazing Calculator so that glazing and air movement calculations can be automated. - [The protocol](/sites/default/files/atoms/files/alterations-additions-protocol-for-energy-efficiency-final_2.pdf) and the four resources will be updated regularly. Ensure that you are using the latest version by checking the date on the document.
