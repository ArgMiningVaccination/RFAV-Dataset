Health technology assessment of the different dialysis modalities in Norway. Report from Kunnskapssenteret no.1 9-2013. Oslo: Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, 2013. Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services summarizes and disseminates evidence concerning the effect of treatments, methods, and interventions in health services, in addition to monitoring health service quality. Our goal is to support good decision making in order to provide patients in Norway with the best possible care. The Knowledge Centre is organized under The Norweg ian Directorate of Health, but is scientifically and professionally independent. The Centre has no authority to develop health policy or responsibility to implement policies. We would like to thank all contributors for their expertise in this project. Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services assumes final responsibility for the content of this report.

Title: Health technology assessment of the different dialysis modalities in Norway -------------------------------------- Type of publication: Health technology assessment Health technology assess- ment (HTA) is a multidisci- plinary process that summa-rizes information about the medical, social, economic and ethical issues related to the use of a health technol- ogy in a systematic, trans-parent, unbiased, robust manner. Its aim is to inform the development of safe, effective health policies that are patient focused and that seek to achieve best value. -------------------------------------- Doesn't answer everything: - Excludes studies that fall outside of the inclusion criteria - No recommendations -------------------------------------- Publisher: Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services -------------------------------------- Updated: August 2013. 3 Executive summary Executive summary Background About 11 % of the Norwegian population has chronic kidney disease (CKD). Some of these persons develop end-st age renal failure with the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). The number of dialysis patients in Norway has increased from 241 in 1990 to 1240 in 2012. With the expected demographic development of increased numbers of elderly people, pe ople with high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes, one can anticipate a further increase in the number of people with chronic renal failure in need of RRT in the future. Generally, there are two different types of dialysis: hemodialysis (HD) and peritone- al dialysis (PD). In Norway hemodialysis pe rformed in hospitals (satellites included) is the most frequently used modality (84. 2%), whereas peritoneal dialysis at home makes up for 15.8%. Only 11 patients (0.8 %) received hemodialysis at home by the end of 2012 (1). Upon a request from The Norwegian Direct orate of Health we performed a Health Technology Assessment comparing efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of the dif- ferent dialysis modalities in Norway. This request has its background in \"The Nor- wegian action plan for the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease\" (2011-2015)\". With the increasing number of dialysis patients expected, there is a need to compare both cost-effectiveness and safety data for the different dialysis modalities used in Norway today. Objective Our objective was to perform a Health Te chnology Assessment comparing efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of the differe nt dialysis modalities 1) Hemodialysis car- ried out in hospital, 2) self-care hemodialysi s in hospital, 3) hemodialysis in satellite units (nursing home, local medical centre), 4) hemodialysis at home and 5) perito- neal dialysis at home for patients above 18 years with end-stage renal failure requir- 4 Executive summary ing dialysis in Norway. Our outcomes were mortality, complications that require special measures and quality of life. Method We performed a systematic literature sear ch for systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials and controlled observat ional studies to find information about mortality, complications that require special measures and quality of life for the specified dialysis modalities. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was as- sessed by GRADE. We performed a cost-utility analysis (CUA) where relevant costs were expressed in 2012 Norwegian kroner (NOK), and effects were expressed in quality-adjusted life- years (QALYs). The analysis was carried out from both a societal and healthcare per-spective. In order to assess the cost-effectiveness of different dialysis modalities, a decision analytic model was developed in TreeAge pro \u00ae 2012. The model is of the Markov type, in which a cohort of patients is follo wed over a given period of time. A Markov model was considered appropriate as end stage renal failure (ESRF) is a chronic condition requiring continuous treatment. The results were expressed as mean increm ental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and mean incremental net health benefit. Uncertainties in model para meters were handled by pe rforming one-way (tornado diagram) and probabilistic se nsitivity analyses, designed as a Monte Carlo simula- tion, with 1000 iterations. Results In this HTA we have systematically revi ewed and summarized the clinical results from 18 publications report ing results from two randomiz ed controlled studies and 17 observational studies. We have further performed an economic evaluation to examine the relative cost-effectiveness in a Norwegian setting of different dialysis modalities from both healthcare and societal perspectives in patients with end stage renal disease. Clinical findings Of 21 possible comparisons only six had published data. For the comparisons with published data an d low quality of the evidence, we found: no significant differences in mortality, in quality of life or in infections significantly fewer hosp italisation days per patient per year in the hemodialysis hospital group versus the peritoneal at home dialysis group 5 Executive summary Economic evaluation From a healthcare perspective: Hemodi alysis at home was more effective and less costly (the dominant modality) rela tive to hemodialysis at hospital and hemodialysis in satellite. He modialysis at home was more costly and more effective than self-care hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis although the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER; NOK 1,651,099 and NOK 4,344,526, respectively) were clearly above the suggested threshold for cost- effectiveness of NOK 588,000 per QALY gained. From a societal perspective: Hemodi at home dominated all other in hospital, self-care hemodialysis and hemodialysis in satellite). Hemodialysis at home was more costly and more effective relative to peritoneal dialysis, but the ICER (NOK 2,657,211) was above the suggested threshold. The results of our sensitivity analysis sh owed that cost data had the greatest impact on the results' uncertainty. Discussion Most of our documentation re garding effectiveness of th e different dialysis modali- ties came from controlled observational studies. Since observational studies lack randomization they are normally deemed to have a greater potential for varying patient characteristics across groups at baseline. We have therefore only assessed studies where the groups did not differ sign ificantly in comorbid ity at baseline. For this HTA we were asked specifically to focus on th e type of dialysis performed and the delivery location. Consequently, we could not examine differences in dialysis frequency, dialysis adequacy, residual functi on or dialysis equipment, all of which could possibly have influenced our results. Lack of data comparing different hemodialys is modalities (with regard to treatment location) was the most important limitation of this study. This limitation was rele- vant to all parameters, i.e. effect, complications, qu ality of life and costs. Little research exists examining the costs of different dialysis modalities in Norway, making it difficult to obtain reliable co st information for the different modalities, particularly home and satellite, and with regard to geographical conditions and ex- isting infrastructure in di fferent regions. Although we have tried to conduct our analyses based on best available data, and have incorporated uncertainty around cost estimates in the sensitivity analysis, th e cost estimates need to be treated with some caution. 6 Executive summary In several cases, efficacy parameters used in the mode l are based on meta-analyses with no significant results. In health econom ic evaluation it is a common practice to include no significant differences since effe ct estimates from cl inical studies them- selves are considered to be the most likely outcome, and because it is assumed that the probability distributions represent the actual uncertainty. Conclusion In our model analyses all dialysis modaliti es were almost equally effective. When effects are combined with cost, hemodial ysis at home was the most cost-effective alternative among the hemodialysis modaliti es. Peritoneal dialysis was the least ex- pensive and hence the most cost-effective alternative compared to all antall dialyse-pasienter i Norge fordoblet.

Some of these pers ons develop end-stage renal failure with the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Renal transplantation is a common treatment (1), but not all patients with a ne ed for RRT can get a graft. At the end of 2012, 4448 persons (886.5 persons per million residents) received RRT in Norway, 1240 of those were on chronic dialysis, an d more than 50% of those who got chronic dialysis in 2012, were considered not suitab le for transplantation; i.e. 649 persons (1).

The number of dialysis patients in Norway has increased from 241 in 1990 to 1240 in 2012 (1). With the expected demographic development, with increased number of elderly people, people with high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases and/or di- abetes, one can anticipate an increase in the number of people with chronic renal failure in need of RRT in the future (1;5). Generally, there are two different types of dialysis: hemodialysis (HD) and peritone- al dialysis (PD). In hemodialysis circ ulating blood is filtered through a semiper- meable membrane in a machine which removes waste products and water from the blood. In peritoneal dialysis the patient' s own peritoneal membrane inside the ab- dominal cavity is used as the dialysis me mbrane (5). Hemodialysis can be performed in hospitals, different medical institutions or at home, whereas peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a home based dialysis. Hemodialys is is usually performed 3-5 hours 3 times a week (5), whereas PD at home is contin uously performed with change of fluid 4 times per 24 hours (CAPD) or by use of a machine that exchanges the fluid during the night (APD) (5). In Norway hemodialysis performed in hospit als (satellites includ ed) is the most fre- quently used modality (84.2%), whereas PD at home makes up for 15.8%. Only 11 patients (0.8%) received HD at home by th e end of 2012 (1). The choice of dialysis modality depends on patients comorbidity, suitability for renal transplantation and for those on the waiting list, expe cted time to transplantation. All counties, except one, have a central re nal unit and some have two, further some counties have satellite units run in close contact with the central unit. There is only one transplant centre in Norway at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet. Pre- transplant work-up, as well as post-transplant follow-up beyond 10 weeks, is han- dled by the county-centres. To compare efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the different dialysis modalities for patients with end-stage renal failure requ iring dialysis in Norway, The Norwegian 22 Background Directorate of Health requested The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services (NOKC) for a health technology assessment (HTA). Th is request has its background in \"Handlingsplan for forebygging og behandling av kronisk nyresyk- dom/The action plan for prevention and tr eatment of chronic kidney disease (2011- 2015)\" (5). This plan aims that patients with chronic kidney disease should be offered good and individual renal replacement therapy, inde pendent of residence, socioeconomic sit- uation and ethnicity, and fu rthermore that the traveling distance between home and dialysis centre should not be more than one hour. With the increasing number of dialysis patients expected, there is a need to compare both cost-effectiveness- and safety data fo r the different dialysis modalities used in Norway today. Introduction to health technology assessment (HTA) The basis of an HTA is a systematic review and evaluation of scientific literature on efficacy and safety of different therapeutic interventions or diagnostics. The HTA may also include economic evaluations and a discussion regarding ethical, social, legal and organizational aspects dependin g on the question under evaluation. This HTA consists of data from a systematic review summarizing efficacy and safety data and an economic model-based evaluation relevant for the Norwegian set- ting. Introduction to Economic Evaluations of Health Care Programmes The basic task of any econom ic evaluation is to identify, measure and compare costs and consequences of the alternatives under consideration in an incremental analy-sis\u2014one in which the differences in costs are compared with differences in conse- quences (6). Hence, results of economic evaluations can be expressed as an incre- mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), whic h is defined by the following equation: Because the health care sector, like society in general, is restricted by scarce re- sources and budget constraints, economic evaluations are important tools for deci- sion makers facing questions of how to pr ioritize treatments and maximize health benefits using scarce resources. For an ec onomic evaluation to be meaningful in a decision making process, the ICER must be judged with regard to a ceiling ratio that EC Effect EffectCost CostICER comparator on interventicomparator on interventi 23 Background reflects the decision maker's maximum will ingness to pay (WTP) for a health gain. The decision rule for an economic evaluation can therefore be expressed as where equals WTP, and means that if the ICER of an intervention is below the ceil- ing ratio, introducing the intervention repr esents good value for money. Because the ICER has poor statistical properties, ICERs are often rearranged to express either incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) or incremental net health benefit (INHB), which yields the following decision rules related to INMB or INHB. INMB: E - C > 0 INHB: E - (C/) > 0 An intervention can in other words be consid ered cost-effective if it yields a positive INHB or INMB. Economic evaluations are often based on de cision models (such as decision trees, Markov models, etc.) that calculate results based on various input parameters in the model. Because there are always uncertainties related to the values of these parame-ters, sensitivity analysis is an important fe ature of any economic evaluation based on a decision model framework. In short, se nsitivity analysis illustrates how much the results vary when model para meters are changed. Sensitivity analyses can be per- formed in many ways, with one-way or tw o-way sensitivity analysis being common approaches. These entail changing, respectively, one or two model-parameters at a time while all of the other model-parameters are held constant in order to determine how much impact the variation in these parameters has on the results. One-way sen- sitivity analyses are often presented as to rnado-diagrams, which identify and illus- trate the model-parameters that have the highest impact on the results. Another important kind of sens itivity analysis is referred to as probabilistic sensitivi- ty analysis (PSA). The advantage of PSA is that it makes it possible to take the uncer- tainties of all of the model-parameters into account simultaneously. The basic ap- proach in PSA is to assign appropriat e probability distributions to the model- parameters, which makes it possible to replace the \"fixed\" values of the parameters with values generated by random draws from the distributions. Doing this repeated- ly, with a specified number of iterations, makes it possible to estimate the probabili- ties that alternative interventions are cost-e ffective subject to different ceiling values of WTP. The calculation is based on the alternative that renders the highest values of NMB or NHB. Results from PSAs are often presented as scatter plots, which show point estimates of the ICER for all iterations in the cost-effectiveness plane, and also EC 24 Background as cost-effectiveness acceptab ility curves (CEACs), which show the probability of the alternatives being cost-effective subject to changing values of WTP. Another result from PSA is the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). This is a number that indicates the value to society of having more accurate information about the decision, given a WTP. If EVPI fo r a given population seems large, it might be of interest to determine for which parame ters it would be most useful to obtain additional data. Expected value of perfec t information for parameters is a more time-consuming analysis that can help determine for which single parameters or groups of parameters it is most co st-effective to conduct new research. In short, making a model probabilistic mean s that it is possible to estimate the un- certainty associated with a decision to im plement alternative interventions, and also provides a possibility of estimating the value of collecting additional information from new research. Priority setting criteria According to Norwegian policy documents (7;8 ), a treatment should be prioritized if the following criteria are met: The disease is severe: A disease is considered severe to the degree that it causes pain and discomfort, loss of physical, psyc hological and social function and if it limits the individual in his or her daily activities. Severity is also evaluated according to the risk increase the disease entails in terms of death, disability and discomfort, if treatment is postponed. The treatment is effective: The patient should be expected to benefit from treatment in terms of longevity or improv ed quality of life of certain duration. The treatment effectiveness should also be well documented. The treatment is cost-effective: The additional costs of the treatment should be reasonable compared to the additional benefits. The policy documents mentioned above give no guidance as to what constitutes a \"reasonable\" relationship be tween costs and effectiveness for a given health inter- vention. The Directorate of Health, howe ver, has recommended a preliminary esti- mate of NOK 500 000 per statistical life ye ar in full health (9;10). This value was based on Norwegian price levels in 2005, and translates to 588 000 for 2012 (9). However, there is no consensus regarding th is threshold value, nor has it been sub- ject to a political process and can therefor e be regarded as nothing more than a ten- tative suggestion. 25 Clinical evaluation - Methods Clinical evaluation - Methods Literature search Research librarian Ingrid Harboe planned and executed all systematic searches in collaboration with the project group. The strategy included both subject headings (MeSH, Emtree) and text words. Searches were limited to systematic reviews (SR) and controlled studies, both in the time peri od from 1995 to the date for the search. The reason for choosing 1995 as the starti ng point was that erythropoietin was in- troduced about that time (for more info rmation about erythrop oietin see Glossary and abbreviations). The searches for SRs and controlled studies were performed separately. The complete search strategies are listed in appendix 1. We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Library; CDSR, DARE, Central, HTA, NHS EED Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD); DARE, HTA, NHS EED Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1946 to present EMBASE (Ovid) 1980 to present We checked the reference lists in systematic reviews that we reviewed in full text, and performed manual searches in the following websites: INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment), Clinical Evidence, ISI Web of Knowledge, NHS Evidence, AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's), SBU Health Technolo- gy Assessment ), Dacehta, Finohta/ THL (National Institute for Health and Wel- fare), CADTH (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health ), AHTA (Adelaide Health Technology Assessment ), NIHR (National Institute for Health Research), and NICE (National Institute for Heal th and Care Excellence). Inclusion criteria Population Patients above 18 years with end-stage renal failure, inde- pendent of comorbidity, who need dialysis treatment, either as life-time treatment or while waiting for kidney transplantation 26 Clinical evaluation - Methods Interventions Hemodialysis carried out in hospital Self-care hemodialysis carried out in hospital Hemodialysis carried out in satellite unit Hemodialysis carried out in the patient's home Peritoneal dialysis (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritone al dialysis (APD)) carried out at home after training in hospital Comparator: Dependent on available data we intended to compare all interventions with the alternative interventions. Outcomes: Mortality Quality of life (QoL) Complications that requ ire special measures ( i.e. hospitalisation, antibiotic treatment) Study design: Systematic reviews Randomized controlled trials Controlled observational studies Languages: No limitations in languages during the search, but we only included articles in English, articles with English abstract or articles in Scandinavian. Selection of articles Two reviewers independently inspected all citations generated by the search in order to identify potentially relevant articles base d on title and/or abstract. Full text publi- cations were obtained for articles appearing to meet the inclusion criteria or in cases where sufficient information was not availa ble to make a decision. Two persons in- dependently assessed whether the article was relevant or not according to our list of inclusion criteria. Disagreements were reso lved by discussion or by consulting a third reviewer. Articles meeting the pre-defined inclusion crit eria were assessed for risk of bias (11). All assessments were performed and agreed upon by two researchers. In addition to assessing risk of bias, we al so performed a close inspection of baseline characteristics in the different treatment groups included in the studies. To be certain that the estimates of efficacy or sa fety reflected the delivered treatments, and not different prognostic features of the pa tients, we examined the baseline data of patients included in the studies. If diffe rences in comorbidity between groups were reported or detected by our own analysis; or if no description of the patients comorbidity were reported, descriptive information about the study will only be presented in an Appendix. If however the article provided analyses that adjusted for this difference, the study will be included in our analyses and our assessments. This 27 Clinical evaluation - Methods means that the studies presented in the Appendix had either no comorbidity data reported or had adjustments that did not fulfil our study aim. Data analysis One reviewer extracted data from the included articles and another reviewer checked these results for accuracy. We extrac ted data as they were presented in the included publications. When data were presented in several ways, we chose to report data in our preferred order: hazard ratio (HR), relative risk (RR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Where both unadjusted and adjusted data were available, we preferred adjusted data if adjustments seemed reasonable. When possible we performed meta-analyses using a random effects model. Forest plots are presented in the results section. Sometimes, when we found it helpful, we also pre- sented outcome data from a single study in forest plots. In cases where both events and patients at risk were available from the publications for all studies for a specific outcome, RRs were calculated using the Mantel-Haenzel approach in Review Manager. When the data regarding the same outcome were re- ported in different ways in the included publ ications, we re-calculated to log risk ra- tios and standard error, and the common RR was calculated using inverse variance in Review Manager. Footnotes in the forest plots provide details about the original data. Grading the quality of evidence Two persons assessed the overall document ation for each outcome by using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation, www.gradeworkinggroup.org ). In the GRADE system outcome documentation from observational studies starts at low quality and outcome documentation from ran- domized controlled trials starts at high. Th e method involves an evaluation of study type, study quality/risk of bias, consistenc y between trials, directness (how similar the population, intervention, and outcomes are between the trials and the objectives of this report) and precision of the estimates. For the observational studies it is pos- sible to rate up the quality of evidence. The three primary reasons for rating up are: 1) a large magnitude of effect exists; 2) there is a dose-response gradient, and 3) all plausible confounders or other biases incr ease our confidence in the estimated ef- fect. Finally the overall quality will be ca tegorized as high, moderate, low or very low. 28 Clinical evaluation - Methods GRADE gives the following definition of the different classes of evidence: Grade Definition High We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect Moderate We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different Low Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect Very low We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect 29 Clinical evaluation - Results Clinical evaluation - Results Result of the literature search The literature searches were done in Ma y 2012, and updated in August 2013, see Appendix 1 for details. We searched bo th for systematic reviews/HTAs and con- trolled studies. We identified 109 systematic reviews/HTAs of which 24 were re- viewed in full text. None fulfilled our incl usion criteria upon cl oser inspection. We identified 4346 controlled studies, of which 157 titles were found to be potentially relevant and full text copies were reviewed. Of those we included 33 studies. We also performed a manual search in the referenc e lists of included systematic reviews and websites of sister HTA agencies (the website searches were done in April 2012), identifying two controlled studies. Finally, 35 publicatio ns met our pre-specified in- clusion criteria. A full list of the excluded studies and the reason for the exclusion is given in Appendix 2. However, 17 of the included 35 publications either reported insufficient details or lacked data about patient comorbidities. Accordingly we only present descriptive information for these studies in Appendix 3. Ultimately, 18 publications constitute the documentation and are summarized in this report. These publications report re- sults from two randomized controlled studies and 17 observational studies (Figure 3). 30 Clinical evaluation - Results Figure 3 Flowchart of identification of documentation. Ongoing studies In August 2013 we searched WHO Internat ional Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (ICTRP) and Clinical Trials .gov to search for ongoing studies.

The 17 observational studies included ten retrospective cohort studies, three prospective cohort studies and four cross-sectional studies. The arti cles were published betwee n 1999 to 2012 with study periods from 1994 to 2008. The studie s were performed in the USA (5), The Netherlands (2), Spain (2), Canada (2 ) and Denmark (1), England and Wales (1), France (1), Greece (1), China (1), Mexico ( 1), Malaysia (1) and Singapore (1). The two RCTs included 34 and 38 patients respectively, while patient totals ranged from 28 to 1238 in the observational studies. Duration of follow-up was 4-86 months. Population All patients included were above 18 year s of age and had end stage renal disease requiring dialysis. The mean age of the patients in the studies ranged from 41 to 79, and the percent males in the studies ranged from 26 to 73 % (13 of the 19 studies had more than 50 % men). The compared patient groups in the studies we have used for outcome assessment had no significant differences in baseline comorbidity. Intervention/controls Of 21 possible comparisons, only six had da ta usable for our analyses. Figure 2 below shows the possible comparisons and ou tcomes reported for the specific comparisons. Outcomes in bold are those where the patient groups had no significant difference in comorbidity, or with analysis that adjusted for this. Those are presented in the following pages. Outcomes in brackets are from studies that either had no comorbidity data reported, or had adjustments that did not fulfil our study aim. Information from such studies is only presented descript ively in the Appendix 3. The comparison with most data was perito neal dialysis (PD) versus hemodialysis in hospital (HD hospital). Peritoneal dialysis was done at home. Peritoneal dialysis can be of two types, either as continuous am bulatory peritoneal di alysis (CAPD) or as automated peritoneal dialysis. When we co mpared PD versus HD we did not specify if the peritoneal dialysis were given as CAPD or APD. The reason for this is that most of these studies did no t specify the type of perito neal dialysis used. However, two studies (14;24) had as aim to compare APD versus CAPD. The frequency of dialysis for hemodialysis varied between the studies from 3 times per week to 5-7 times per week. 32 Clinical evaluation - Results HD hospital HD self care hospital HD satellite HD home CAPD home APD home PD home HD hospital HD self care hospital No data HD satellite Complications (1 study ) QoL (1 study) [ Mortality] No data HD home [ Mortality] No data Mortality (3 studies) Complications (2 studies) [ Mortality] CAPD home No data No data No data No data APD home No data No data No data No data Mortality (1 study) Complications (2 studies) QoL (1 study) [ Mortality, complications] PD home Mortality (7 studies) Complications (4 studies) QoL (3 studies) [Mortality, Complication, QoL)] No data Mortality (1 study) Complications (2 studies) [ Mortality, QoL] Complications (1 study) QoL (1 study) [ Mortality] No data No data Figure 4 Site comparisons with documentation.

QoL= quality of life Outcomes Mortality was reported in 11 of the studies we assessed. It was reported as events (12;13;24;26), hazard ratios (18;19;27), relative risk (17), Kaplan Meier survival (16) and percent survival (21). One publication gave no data, bu t only reported that there was no significant difference in mortality (25). Complications that require special measures were reported in ten studies. Complications were reported as hospit al days (12;16;20;22;25;26), hospital 33 Clinical evaluation - Results admissions, including different reasons for admissions (12;13;16;18;20;22;25;28), infections, including different types of infections (14;16;24;2 6), cardiovascular events (16), cerebrovascular accidents (16) and septic arthritis (16). Complications were reported in different ways in the publications. Quality of life was reported in five publicatio ns. The tools used were SF-36 (The Short Form (36) Health Survey) mental component (19;22;23;29), SF-36 physical component (19;22;23;29), KDQL (Kidney Di sease Quality of Life) (15;22), EuroQoL (European Quality of Life) (22). Quality of life was measured as mean difference \u00b1 standard differences. Risk of bias for the in cluded publications We assessed the risk of bias for the included RCTs to be unclear for Bro et al. 1999 (14) and high for Korevaar et al. 2003 (19). The reason for the high risk of bias for Korevaar was that the stud y was planned statistically to include 100 patients; however, it was stopped after three year s due to recruiting problems (only 38 patients randomised). Bro because it was not described if the outcomes assments were blinded. We assessed all of the observ ational studies to have relative high risk of bias, mainly due to lack of randomizat ion. Our asessments are shown in Table 1 below.

PD home versus HD hospital Description of the included studies We included nine studies (12;16;17;19;21;23;25;26;29) for the comparison of pa- tients receiving PD at home versus patients receiving HD in hospital. An overview of the studies is presented in Table 2. Details on patient characteristics at baseline can be seen in Appendix 4, Table I. We report results for mortality, complications and quality of life. Seven of the eight studies reported mortality data, four stud ies reported data on complications and three studies reported da ta on quality of life. Peritoneal dialysis was performed at home in all of the studies. Four studies specified the treatment as continuous ambulatory peritone al dialysis (CAPD) (16;19;23;25). 35 Clinical evaluation - Results Three additional studies had patient groups that were significant different in comorbidity. The studies had used adjusted analysis, but the adjustments used did not fulfil our study aim. Further informat ion about these studies, and about seven studies that lacked comorbidity data altogether, is presented in Appendix 3.

We found no signifi- cant difference in mortality between the patients receiving PD at home and patients receiving HD in hospital (Figure 5). The re lative risk in the RCT was 0.28 (0.06 to 1.22) while a meta-analysis of observationa l studies resulted in RR 1.11 (0.59 to 2.10). One additional observational study also reported no significant difference in survival between the groups (25). For the observational studies it was possible to do sensitivity an alyses for different treatment durations. Neither showed a si gnificant difference in mortality between the patient groups (Figure 5).

The quality of the evidence for mortality For the RCT we evaluated the documentatio n for mortality for the comparison PD versus HD hospital to be of low quality (Table 3). For the observational studies we evaluated the total documentation for all the studies for mortality to be of very low quality (Table 3). The reasons for downgrading the quality for mortality are shown in the footnotes to Table 3.

The analyses did not find any significant differences in mortality between the pa- tients in the PD and the HD hospital gr oups. The result are based on an RCT for which we assessed the mortality document ation quality to be low, and a meta- analysis of five observational studies fo r which we assessed the mortality documen- tation to be very low. Whether the results are due to poor study designs or true ob- servations are for further studies to elucidate. Complications that require special measures Four studies reported results on complica tions that require special measures. Com- plications were reported as hospital da ys (12;16;25;26) or as hospital admissions (12;16;25). Forest plots for these outcomes are presented in Figure 6. Patients in the HD hospital group had significantly fewer hospital days admitted per patient per year than in the PD group: RR 1.13 (1.04 to 1.23); whereas there was no significant difference between the groups for hospital admissions per patient per year; RR 0.89 (0.50-1.55).

However, with no outcomes in common, meta-analyses were not feasible. The analyses showed significant difference between the groups in favour of the PD patients for cardiovascular events including arrhythmias (RR 0.17 (0.07- 0.38), p<0.0001) and for all acute coronary sy ndromes (RR 0.03 (0 - 0.54), p=0.02). For dialysis modality related infections th ere was a significant difference in favour of the HD hospit al patients; RR 137.36 (8.46-2228.93), p=0.0005. For all of the other reported complications there were no significant difference between the patient groups. The quality of the evidence for complications We evaluated the documentatio n for hospital days admitted per patient per year to be low. All of the other outcomes for comp lications were evaluated as very low (Ta- ble 4). The reasons for downgrading the quality for mortality are shown in the foot-notes to Table 4.

What do the results mean? We found significant fewer hospital days per patient per year in the HD hospital group than in the PD group. The results are based on documentation from four ob- servational studies. We assessed the quality of the documentation to be low. This means that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. We found a significant difference in favour of the HD hospital patients for dialysis modality related infections. The result is based on documentation from one observa- tional study where we assessed the quality of the documentation to be very low. This means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimate. There were significantly fewer PD patients than HD hospital patients that developed cardio-vascular events including arrhythmias and acute coronary syndromes. The result is based on documentation from one observational study (the same as above) where we assessed the quality of the documentation to be very low. This means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimate. For all of the other reported complications (hospital admissions, infections, cerebro- vascular accidents (infarct and hemorrhages ), dialysis modality access dysfunctions, pneumonia and septic arthritis) we found no significant difference between the pa- tient groups. The results for hospital admi ssions per patients pe r year are based on documentation from three observational st udies, whereas the documentation for all the other outcomes came from one observat ional study. For all these outcomes we assessed the documentation to be very low. This means that we have very little con- fidence in the effect estimate. Quality of life Three studies reported on quality of life (19;23;29), one RCT (19) and two observational studies. Quality of life was measured as mean quality-adjusted life years (QALY) or the physical and mental components of the SF -36. All were meas- ured as mean difference \u00b1SD. The different outcomes, length of the studies and the results of the comparison fo r each outcome are shown in Table 5 for two of the stud- ies (19;23). Neither of the two showed si gnificant differences between the groups. The third study (29) could not be included in our analysis since it only reported p-values, 0.098 and 0.009 (higher in the PD patients than in the HD hospital pa- tients) respectively for physical functioning and mental health. 43 Clinical evaluation - Results The quality of the evidence for quality of life For the RCT we evaluated the documentation for quality of life (QALY scores) to be low. For the cross-sectional study the docume ntation for quality of life (SF-36 physi- cal and mental component) was evaluated to be very low (Table 5). The reasons for downgrading the quality for quality of life are shown in the footnotes to table 5.

We evaluated the document ation for quality of life from the RCT to be of low quality. This was a small study with 38 patients that was stopped prematurely due to recruiting problems. This means that our confidence in the ef- fect estimate is limited. The results from the cross-sectional study were based on documentation with very low quality and henc e we have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The third study (29)- that was not included in our analysis since it only reported p-values -showed significan t higher scores for mental health in the PD patients than in the HD hospital patients . Due to lack of data we were not able to perform GRADE for this outcome. HD satellite versus HD hospital Description of the included studies Only one study (22) met our inclusion crit eria and reported comparable treatment groups for the comparison of HD delivered in a satellite unit compared to HD deliv- ered in a hospital. An overview of the study is presented in Table 6. Details on pa- tient characteristics at baseline can be seen in Appendix 4, Table II. Two additional studies lacked informatio n about comorbidity. Information related to these studies is presented in Appendix 3.

Complications that require special measures Roderick et al. 2005 (22) reported data regarding five different complications. They reported a significant differen ce in favour of HD satellite for patients hospitalised, RR 0.80 (0.67-0.95), p= 0.01. We further analysed the reported documentation and found a significant difference also for infect ions, again in favour of HD satellite; RR 0.55 (0.32-0.96), p=0.03. For hospitalisation due to cardiac or vascular causes we analysed the reported data and found a bord erline significant diffe rence in favour of HD satellite, RR 0.53 (0.28 to 1.01), p=0.05. Results are shown in Table 7. The forest plot showing our analyses can be seen in Appendix 7, Figure I. The length of stay in 45 Clinical evaluation - Results hospital was reported as mean\u00b1SD per pati ents. There was no significant difference between the groups for this outcome; SD -1 .10 (-2.60 to 0.40), p=0.15 (Table 7). The quality of the evidence for complications that require special measures We evaluated the documentation for all of th e complication outcomes as very low. The different outcomes and the reasons for downgrading the quality for those are shown in the footno tes to Table 7. Summary of findings for complicati ons that require special measures for HD satellite versus HD hospital Table 7 below gives a summary of the compar ative risks, the relative effects and the quality of the documentation for the reported complications.

GRADE suggests that the threshold for \"appreciable benefit\" or \"appreciable harm\" that should be considered for downgrading is a relative risk reduction (RRR) or relative risk increase (RRI) greater than 25%. 46 Clinical evaluation - Results HD= hemodialysis. For more details see the GRADE evidence profile (Appendix 6). What do the results mean? All the results for complications were based up on data from one observational study. There were significant fewer patients hosp italised and fewer in fections in the HD satellite group than in the HD hospital gr oup. For hospitalisation due to cardiac or vascular causes there was a borderline significant difference in favour of HD satellite group. There was no significant difference between the groups for days per patient in hospital. We assessed all of the documentation for the complications to be of very low quality, hence we have very little confidence in these effect estimates. Quality of life Roderick et al. 2005 (22) measured quality of li fe using EQ-5D utilities, SF-36 phys- ical and mental summary score) and by KDQL KDQL was reported as pooled (combined) es timate of mean satisfaction score, the difference was 7.50 (1.33 to 13.67). The scor e was significantly higher in the HD sat- ellite group. The number of patients included in any of the 11 items for KDQL varied from 70-334 for the satellite group and from 80-281 for the hospital group. The SF-36 mental score was significant lowe r in the HD satellite group. Quality of life measured withSF-36 physical score and EQ-5D show no significant differences between the patient groups. Results are presented in Table 8. The quality of the evidence for quality of life We evaluated the documentation for all of the quality of life outcomes as very low. The different outcomes and the reasons for downgrading the quality for those are shown in the footnotes to Table 8.

All the results for quality of life were based upon data from one observational study. The score for KDQL was significant higher in the HD satellite group than in the HD hospital group. Whereas the SF-36 mental score was significant lower in the HD sat-ellite group than in the HD hospital grou p. Quality of life measured with SF-36 physical score and EQ-5D show no signif icant differences between the patient groups. We assessed all of the documentatio n for quality of life to be of very low quality. This means that we have very litt le confidence in these effect estimates. PD home versus HD satellite Description of the included studies Two studies (13;28) met our inclusion crit eria and reported comparable treatment groups for the comparison of PD performed at home compared to HD delivered in a satellite unit. An overview of the studies is presented in Table 9. Details on patient characteristics at baseline can be seen in Appendix 4, Table III. Two additional studies had patient groups with significant differenence in comorbidity. One of these had no adjusted analysis and the other had used adjustments that did not fulfil our study aim. Further information about these 48 Clinical evaluation - Results studies, and about one study that lacked co morbidity data altogether, is presented in Appendix 3.

Johansen et al. 2009 (18) described two studies: nocturnal HD at home and short daily HD at home, each compared with its own matched group treated with conventional HD in a satellite unit. Weinhandl et al. 2012 (27) compared daily home HD with thrice-weekly HD in-center (satellite). An overview of the studies is presented in Ta ble 12.

Efficacy results for APD home versus CAPD home Mortality Only Sanchez et al . 2008 (24) reported data regardin g mortality. Patients survival at 1, 2 and 3 years was reported (Table 19). We calculated this as mortality and pre- sented our results as a forest plot (Appendix 7, figure II). Estima tes favour APD at all time points, this was significant after 1 (RR 0.48 (0.30-0.77), p=0.002) and 3 years (RR 0.69 (0.54-0.86), p= 0.001), and border line significant after 2 years (RR 0.74 (0.55-1.00), p=0.05). The quality of the evidence for mortality We assessed the documentation for mortalit y to be very low.

What do the results mean? The documentation for mortality came one ob servational study, and we assessed the quality of this outcome to be very low. Henc e, we have very little confidence in the effect estimate. Complications that require special measures Complications in the form of different infection types were reported in both the in- cluded studies (14;24). Peritonitis was re ported in both the included RCT and the observational study. Due to different study designs these were not pooled in a meta- analysis. Results favoured APD, but this was only significant in the observational study (Table 20 and Appendix 7, figure III) The relative risks were 0.54 (0.06-5.24), p= 0.60 and 0.46 (0.34-0.63), p<0.00001) respectively for the RCT (14) and the ob-servational study (24). Bro et al. 1999 (14) also reported on exit site infection (RR 1.08 (0.08-15.46), p=0.95) and tunnel infection (RR 3.23 (0.14-72.46), p=0.46). Neither showed statistically significant resu lts (Table 20). The forest plot of our analyses can be seen in Appendix 7, figure IV. 62 Clinical evaluation - Results The quality of the evidence for complications that require special measures We assessed the documentation for peritoni tis, exit-site infect ion and tunnel infec- tion from the RCT (14) to be low. The do cumentation for peritonitis from the obser- vational study was assessed by us as very low. The reasons for downgrading the quality are shown in the footnotes to table 20.

Our analysis of the observational study (24) showed significantly fewer cases of peri- tonitis in the APD group. None of the comparisons of infect ions (peritonitis, exit site infection and tunnel infection) from th e RCT (14) showed any significant differ- ences. We assessed the documentation for the outcomes peritonitis, exit-site infec-tion and tunnel infection from the RCT to be of low quality. Ho wever, this RCT (14) was a very small study with only 34 patients , hence it is very li kely that further re- search could give different results. The documentation for peritonitis from the ob- servational study we assessed to be of very low quality, hence we have very little con- fidence in this effect estimate. Quality of life Bro et al . 1999 (14) reported quality of life meas ured by SF-36, but only in a figure. According to the article there was no difference in the changes of scores from start to end of study between patients treated with APD and CAPD. The quality of the evidence for quality of life We assessed the documentation for quality of life from the RCT to be very low. The reasons for downgrading the quality are shown in the footnotes to table 21.

The documentation of quality of life came from one RCT (14), and we assessed this documentation to be of very low quality, henc e we have very little confidence in this effect estimate. Overall summary of the clinical results Mortality We found no significant difference in mortality for the comparison PD home versus HD hospital and the comparison HD home versus HD satelitte. The quality of the documentation was low. Other comparisons (HD satellite versus PD home and APD versus CAPD) had very low documentation quality for mortality. Complications We found significantly fewer hospitalisat ion days per patients per year for the patients in the HD hospital group than in the PD home group. The quality of the documentation was low. We found no significant difference in diffe rent types of infections (peritonitis, exit site infection and tunnel infectio n for the patients in the APD versus CAPD groups. The quality of the documentation was low. All other comparisons (HD satellite vs HD hospital, HD home versus HD satellite, HD satellite versus PD home, HD home versus PD home) had very low documentation quality for complications. Quality of life We found no significant difference in quality of life for the the patients in the PD home and the HD hospital groups. The quality of the documentation was low. All other comparisons (HD satellite vs HD hospital, HD home versus PD home, APD versus CAPD) had very low docume ntation quality for this outcome. 65 Economic evaluation-Methods Economic evaluation-Methods General We performed a cost-utility analysis (CUA) where relevant costs were expressed in 2012 Norwegian kroner (NOK), and effects were expressed in quality-adjusted life- years (QALYs). The analysis was carried out from both a societal and healthcare per- spective (more detail about the costs incl uded in the model from different perspec- tives is discussed later in this report; se e page 74). Both costs and effects were dis- counted using an annual discount rate of 4% in accordance with Norwegian econom- ic guidelines (9;30). The results were expressed as mean increm ental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and mean incremental net health benefit from 1000 runs of the model in base-case. In the absence of an explicit threshold value for cost-effective interventions in Norway, we assumed the value (NOK 588,000 per QALY gained) recommended by the Nor- wegian Directory of Health as a be st possible temporary estimate (9). Uncertainties in model para meters were handled by pe rforming one-way (tornado diagram) and probabilistic se nsitivity analyses, designed as a Monte Carlo simula- tion, with 1000 iterations. Model structure In order to assess the cost-effectiveness of different dialysis modalities, a decision analytic model was developed in TreeAge pro \u00ae 2012. The model is of the Markov type, in which a cohort of patients is follo wed over a given period of time. A Markov model was considered appropriate as end stage renal failure (ESRF) is a chronic condition requiring continuous treatment. The model assumes that patients with severe renal failure begin in one of the dialysis modalities: hospital hemodialysis (HD hosp ital), self-care hemodialysis carried out hospital (HD selfcare), satellite hemodialysis (HD satellite), home hemodialysis (HD home) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Th ree states, HD home, HD satellite, and PD, include a stabilization and training pe riod in the hospital. Transplantation is included in the model to present all of the possible modalities affording renal re- 66 Economic evaluation-Methods placement therapy for ESRF patients, but only as absorbing state. Once an individu- al makes a transition into the absorbing st ate, no further incurred costs are included in the analysis. Based on the Norwegian renal re gistry annual reports, median time from start of re- nal replacement therapy until death is 33-42 months (31). A 5-year time horizon was therefore used to assess the clinical and economic outcomes associated with each treatment strategy. The cycle length of the model was one year, meaning that any transitions between different states could happen only once per year. Patients could be in only one of the pre-defined states at any time. Upon completion of each cycle patients could, depending on transition pr obabilities, transfer to another state or remain in the same state until death or th e end of the simulation. In addition, pa- tients could experience complication events during each health state. Each state and event is associated with specific outcomes and costs. A graphical representation of the model is shown in Figure 11 and Appendix 8. Figure 11. Model structure (transplantation and death were included in the model only as \"absorbing\" states) HD: APD: automated peritoneal dialysis Patients with severe renal failure HD (Hospital, Selfcare, Satellite, Home)PD (CAPD, APD) Transplantation Death 67 Economic evaluation-Methods Model Parameters The sources and methods used to derive model parameters ar e described below: Probabilities The probability of transferring to another state or remaining in the same state was estimated based on Norwegian epidemiological data and clinical efficacy estimates. The transition probabilities, i.e. the probability of starting on one modality and switching to another, are presented in Table 22. All of the base-line probabilities were based on data from the Norwegian renal registry (Personal communication by dr. med. Torbj\u00f8rn Leivestad (32)) over a 5-year time horizon, i.e. a cohort of patients who started dialysis in 2007 and were followed for 5 years. The registry data was di- vided into HD, PD and transplant patients . The mortality probability for dialysis pa- tients was not separated based on different dialysis modalities. The probability of mortality from each modality was therefore calculated by multiplying the annual probabilities of death for Norwegian dialysis pa tients by the estimate of relative risks of death from our systematic review. As previously noted, transplantation was as- sumed to be an absorbing state in the mode l. All probabilities were incorporated in- to the model as beta distributions. Table 22. Annual transfer probabilities base d on Norwegian rena l registry (32) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 PD to HD 0.05 0.14 0.09 0.11 0.10 0 HD to PD 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.01 0 0 Dialyse- Transplant 0.07 0.13 0.12 0.09 0.08 0.07 Dialyse-death 0.10 0.14 0.19 0.23 0.21 0.25 HD: hemodialysis; PD: peritoneal dialysis Clinical efficacy parameters in the model Clinical efficacy data for the model was derived from our systematic review of the literature as presented earlier in this report (Figure 5 and Figure 9). The relative risks were added to the model as probabilit y distributions. We used log-normal dis- tributions, according to the methodology de scribed by Briggs and co-authors (33). Standard errors for the log- normal distributions were calculated based on confi- dence intervals for efficacy estimates. The estimates related to the calculation of dis- tributions for efficacy parameters used in the model are presented in Table 23. 68 Economic evaluation-Methods Table 23.

In addition, we found an observational stud y that reported the ra te of PD mortality compared with HD satellite, for which we assessed the quality of documentation as very low (see Table 10). Howe ver, to evaluate the relative effectiveness of different dialysis modalities, we should use a commo n comparator in the model. Therefore, we assumed that there is no difference in mortality between the HD hospital and HD satellite and the estimate of relative risks of death presented in Table 23 was used in the model. Costs An annual cost per patient associated with the treatment modalities was calculated for each health state in the model. Our primary analysis was carried out from a healthcare perspective, i.e. only direct costs were calculated. In addition, we pre- sented the results from a soci etal perspective, including direct health care costs as well as indirect costs related to dialysis treatment. We have attempted to identify and appreciate the differences between the treatment options and less emphasis on common elements. Direct costs Direct costs for dialysis care include costs associated with pers onnel (physicians, nurses and other involved personnel), medici nes, supplies, laboratory tests, compli- cations of the dialysis, training, as we ll as other costs borne by hospitals ( e.g. costs associated with telemedicine communicatio n for satellite units, capital and infra- structure costs) and transport cost. All costs were measured in 2012 Norweg ian kroner (NOK). Gamma distributions were applied for all cost parameters, with variation limited to 30% of the base-case value. Personnel costs The costs of personnel involved in dialysis treatment were calculated based on esti- mates of staff time per dialysis session fo r different treatment modalities. For peri- toneal dialysis and HD home, the calculatio n was based on the time required for ini- 69 Economic evaluation-Methods tiation of treatment, training of patien t for the procedure, consultation and out- patient visits. The mean cost per hour was estimated base d on the average healthcare staff salary per month from Stat istics Norway (34) mu ltiplied by 1.4 to account for social expenses (35). The costs of personnel involved in dialysis treat- ment are presented in Table 24 and Appendix 9. Table 24.

The costs associated with additional training for nurses in the satellite unit were es- timated based on costs reported by Bjorvatn (37). The estimated cost in 2012 for ad- ditional training for nurses in the satellite unit was NOK 12,000 per patient per year. Costs of dialysis supplies Costs of dialysis supplies for HD hospital were obtained from a Norwegian study based on data from three major hospitals in Norway (36). The costs were updated to 2012 costs. We assumed that the cost of consumable supplies for satellite and HD self-care was the same as the related costs for HD hospital. Costs of dialysis supplies for HD home were based on the price list pr ovided by Oslo University Hospital (per- sonal communication by head of dialysi s department dr. med Aud-E Stenehjem). We estimated the consumable supplies cost s for PD based on data from two suppli- 70 Economic evaluation-Methods ers of PD consumables in Norway (Baxter and Gambro/Vingmed). The consumable costs for APD are more expensive than for CAPD. We estimated the costs for PD based on the assumption that 60% of PD pa tients use CAPD (32). The costs of dialy- sis supplies included in our model are presented in Table 25.

HD home patients us e different consumable supplies during the training period at the hospital (6 weeks) whic h the mean costs per week were estimated to be 10,140 per patient. Medication costs Drug costs were calculated based on maxi mum pharmacy retail prices (AUP) from Norwegian Medicines Agency (38). Drug do ses were estimated based on treatment guidelines and expert opinion. In our analysis, we have only included costs associat- 71 Economic evaluation-Methods ed with those medications for which consid erable differences in use were reported for HD versus PD patients (based on data obtained from the Norwegian renal regis- try). The probabilities of drug consumption were incorporated as beta distributions in the model. In addition, we included th e cost associated with anti coagulation during hemodialy- sis (HD) therapy, and treatment of iron deficiency anemia (as different drugs and administration methods used for treatment of HD and PD patients) in our analysis. We assumed identical drug costs for all HD modalities. Medication costs are pre- sented in Table 26.

We assumed 5-20% of HD hospital patients required parenteral nutrition (based on expert opinion, HD self-care and HD home patients needed less parenteral nutrition (5%-10%)). Laboratory test costs Annual laboratory test costs were calculated separately for HD and PD patients based on the standard blood tests for dialysis patients and the price lists provided by Oslo University Hospital (personal communi cation by head of dialysis department, dr. med Aud-E Stenehjem).

Oslo university hospital (personal communi cation by dialysis department dr. med Aud-E Stenehjem) HD: hemodialysis; PD: peritoneal dialysis Complications costs Based on our expert group's opinion, we have included two types of complications that require special measures in our model: infections and cardiovascular event. We included peritonitis, as the most common complication, and sepsis for peritoneal dialysis, while for hemodialysis infections (access-related infect ions and sepsis) and cardiovascular events were included in th e analysis. Probabilities of the occurrence of these events were estimated based on data from the Norwegian renal registry (32). The registry reported the occurrence rate of the events at either end of the year (2011) or time of death, considering 220 patients on PD and 998 on HD (40). All rates were transformed into transition probabilities for use in the model. 74 Economic evaluation-Methods Table 28: Complications rate in No rway based on data from the Norwegian renal regis- try (32) Complications Occurrence rate Peritonitis-PD 0.44 Sepsis-PD 0.05 Sepsis-HD 0.11 Access related infections-HD 0.07 Cardiovascular events (percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI)) a 0.05 PD: peritoneal dialysis; HD: hemodialysis a Due to lack of adequate information, we have only included percutaneous coronary inter- ventions as cardiovascular complications in the analysis. Probability of access-related hospitalisatio n and cardiovascular events were adjusted according to different dialysis modalities by multiplying the prob abilities taken from Norwegian renal registry by the relative risks of these events from our systematic review (Table 29 and 30).

We assumed patients received inpatient care for an average of 7-10 days per infection (expert opinion). Th e cost of cardiovascular events were cal- culated based on a Norwegian study (42). For cardiovascular events, we included the costs of two most common in terventions related to corona ry artery surgery (acute myocardial infection (AMI) and angina) in our analysis (43;44). The costs of treating septicemia were also estimated based on a Norwegian study (Wisl\u00f8ff et al. 2006(45)).

The reduction in quality of life associated with complications is addressed in the next section. Capital costs Costs related to equipment (investment co mmodities) were estimated based on data from three major hospitals in Norway (3 6). Costs associated with water system, computers, ECG machine, infusion pump, blood pressure measure, warming plate and the other equipment ( e.g. TV, beds furniture, weights iv -rack, etc) were included in the analysis. An equivalent annual cost was calculated for equipment items over 77 Economic evaluation-Methods relevant life-spans for the items, using a 4% discount rate. The lifetime for the water system and the other equipment were set at 10 and 5 years, respectively. Capital costs associated with home HD treatment were estimated for using the NxStage ma- chine, which requires less installation an d reconstruction than standard hemodialy- sis machines (see Table 32). Table 32: Capital costs per patient per year Costs per patient per year (NOK) HD (hospital, self-care, satellite HD) a 44,838 HD home b 5,000 PD a 6,208 HD: hemodialysis; peritoneal dialysis a Ref.

Personal communication by head of dialysis department at Oslo university hospital; dr. med Aud-E Stenehjem Infrastructure costs Infrastructure costs, i.e. administration costs/overhead costs, were calculated based on the costs reported by Nyhus and co-a uthors (36) and the estimates from communica tion by Kjell Nordaune; de- partment). The infrastructure costs for HD PD were estimated to be approxi- mately NOK 6570 and NOK 550 per patient per month, respectively. Due to uncer- tainly around the estimations, we varied ov erhead costs in the pr obabilistic sensitivi- ty analysis. We used a gamma distribution with a standard error of 780.66 for HD and 75.06 for PD. For HD home, we assumed the same overhead cost as PD (15 visits to the hospital per year 1). Further, HD home patients were treated at the hospital in the training period (about 6 weeks). Overhead costs for HD satellite were estimated based on data reported by Bjorvatn (37). The costs were updated to 2012 prices (approximate- ly NOK 8,553 per patient per month wi th a standard error of 1,309). 1 Some patients need more than one visit per month plus training period for PD patients 78 Economic evaluation-Methods Telemedicine We included in our analysis the cost related to installation of telemedicine equip- ment for satellite units based on the costs reported by Bjorvatn (37). We calculated the cost based on the assumption of a 5-ye ar lifetime for the telemedicine equipment and a discount rate of 4% per year. These costs were updated to 2012 costs (approx- imately NOK 11,000 -13,000 per patient, annually). Line rental for broadband was assumed to be NOK 12,000- NOK 18,000 per patient, annually. Transport costs The average distance traveled to the unit (hospital or satellite unit) was calculated based on data obtained from dialysis cent ers across the country. The average travel cost per mile ( 10 km) was estimated to be NOK 330 (personnel communication with \"Pasientreiser Telemark & Vestfold \"). It was assumed that the average number of hospital visits/treatments per year is 156 for HD hospital and HD satellite patients, and 15 for PD and HD home patients (incl. visiting a nephrologist and initial train- ing). Moreover, we have estimated travel cost associated with initial of treatment (PD, HD home and HD satellite) and treatment of complications. Table 33 summa- rizes the information related to travel costs.

Assuming one physici an visit per month, the costs estimated 79 Economic evaluation-Methods were NOK 500. The costs rela ted to physician travel (one visit per month) and nurs- es travel (attending internal training; 3 times per year) were assumed to be approx- imately NOK 7,200 and NOK 3,600 per year based on costs reported by Bjorvatn (37). Home care A Norwegian study has shown th at about 30-40% of PD patients required home care assistance related to the treatment ( e.g. fluid exchange) (46). We also assumed that 10% -20% of HD home patients might require home care help. The estimated cost of one nurse visit (assumed one hour) was NOK 700 (47;48). Indirect costs We conducted our analyses from a \"limited\" societal perspective in order to present an estimate of costs that may be bo rne by patients and their families ( i.e. value of lost time due to travel). Costs linked to productivity loss were not included in our analysis, as elderly patients account for an increasing fraction of patients on renal replacement therapy (49). The reported average age of the patient undergoing dialy- sis in Norway during the last 5 years is approximately 62 years (31). Moreover, the result of a cohort study among Norwegian di alysis patient indicated that none of the patients was working; two-thirds of patients were retired and the remaining one-third was receiving a disability pension bene fit (50). Therefore, only the value of lei- sure time for patients and value of lost time for any accompanying people were in- cluded in the analysis. Value of leisure time lost to travel was es timated by multiplying lost leisure time (4- 8 hours) by the annual number of treatments and the national average hourly wage rate (approximately NOK 245 per hour) (50). For patients undergoing dialysis in the hospital (both HD hospital and HD self-c are) and satellite unit, we assumed one working-day (7.5 hours) as lost leisure time per treatment. For patients undergoing treatment at home (HD home and PD), the estimated average number of hospital visiting days per year was 15 and the leis ure time loss was assumed to be one work- ing-day at each visit. In addition, based on the a ssumption that 10% -50% of patients were accompanied by another person when visiting the medica l center (hospital or satellite unit), we calculated the value of leisure time for the companions as shown in Table 34. We also assumed that companions did not participate in the labor market, therefore on- ly the value of leisure time for companio ns has been included in the analysis. In our analysis from the societal perspect ive, we have deducted value-added tax and other transfer payments to the government from the included direct costs. We summarize the cost informatio n described above in Table 34. 80 Economic evaluation-Methods Table 34 : Summary of costs per patient per year fo r the dialysis modalities considered in the base-case analysis (NOK) HD hospital HD self-care HD satellite HD home PD Direct costs Personnel Physician Telemedicine e 0 0 0 0 Home care 0 0 0 27,405 89,425 Transport costs 227,310 f 227,310 f 165,700 f 160,000 f g 110,000 f g Staff travel 0 0 10,800 0 0 Indirect costs Value of leisure time; pa-tient 287,330 287,330 287,330 hemodialysis; PD: peritoneal dialysis a Incl. additional training for nurses 81 Economic evaluation-Methods b Initial cost c Incl. parenteral nutrition costs for HD patients (5%-20%) d HD home patients were treated at the hospital in the training period (about 6 weeks) which infrastructure costs were estimated to be NOK 8,540 (initial cost) e Incl. costs associated with line rental for broadband and telemedicine equipment f Travel cost associated with complications and initial of treatment were presented in Table 33 g We assumed that PD patients and HD home patients visit the hospital 12-15 times per year h Value of loss time because of travel during training period (6 weeks) was calculated to be NOK44,200 (initial cost). i We assumed that 30% -50% of patients were accompanied by another person when visiting the medical center. j We assumed that 10% -30% of patients were accompanied by another person when visiting the medical center. Health-related Quality of Life The systematic search described in the clin ical methods section re turned no articles reporting quality of life outcomes measur ed with instruments considered appropri- ate for cost-utility analyses (preference-based, health-relat ed quality of life instru- ments). Many of the studies reported SF-36 quality of life scores, but did not provide the necessary information to convert these measures into EQ-5D utility scores. We searched further in Embase and Medline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses that reported quality of life for dialysis patients based on EQ-5D, 15D, SF-6D, TTO or SG utilities and found two relevant me ta-analyses (51;52). Neither analysis re- vealed significant differences in mean util ity scores of HD and PD patients, regard- less of the utility instrument used. There was also little indication that quality of life for hemodialysis patients varied significantl y with regard to treatment setting (hos- pital, satellite, self-care in hospital or home). For consistency, and acknowledging that di fferent utility instru ments will yield dif- ferent results, we focused on values base d on EQ-5D, the most commonly used in- strument. We examined all studies underlyi ng the meta-analyses that reported EQ- 5D values as the quality of life outcome. The literature search results highlighted the lack of good quality utility-related quality of life data for different dialysis modali- ties. Given the lack of good quality data on heal th-related quality of life, we relied on a Swedish matched-case study (53) that reported EQ-5D values. Because neither me- ta-analysis found significant quality of life differences based on dialysis type or treatment setting and to avoid bias in favour of one of the modali ties, we applied the standard error-adjusted mean of the HD and PD EQ-5D utilities reported in a Swe- dish study as the single QALY weight of 0. 64 (0.34-0.75) for all types of dialysis in the model. This estimate was compatible wi th the results reported by Liem and co- authors (51) of a meta-analysis of quality of life results measured using the EQ-5D instrument. We assumed that all patients we re in the same underlying health state on entering the model. 82 Economic evaluation-Methods Sennf\u00e4lt and co-authors also reported a QALY weight for kidney transplant patients (0.86; 0.81-0.92), and an estimated value fo r utility losses associated with episodes of infection (0.02 per year under the assump tion of five, 2-week infection episodes annually), which are included in our model (53). Because of the lack of quality of life data for dialysis patients experiencing complica- tions associated with cardiovascular even ts, utility losses associated with these events were estimated using the best availa ble data, a Norwegian study of stroke pa- tients from 2011 (54). We assumed that the reduction in utility resulting from com-plication events would last 2 weeks (b ased on expert opinion and (53)). Beta distributions were used for all utility values used in the model. The mean values and standard errors of the utility (QALY) weights used in our model are presented in the Table 35. Table 35: Quality of life data (base-case) QALY weight SE Method of elicitation Sources Patients on dialysis 0,54 0,105 EQ-5D Sennf\u00e4lt et al. 2002 (53) Patients with kidney trans- plant 0.86 0.028 EQ-5D Sennf\u00e4lt et al. 2002 (53) Infection et al. 2001 (53) (54) AMI: Acute myocardial infarction Although the literature review mostly show ed no significant differences between di- alysis modalities, studies have noted that qual ity of life tended to be higher for pa- tients treated in satellite units or treated at home. We therefore performed scenario analyses to test the assumpti on of the potentially higher quality of life associated with treatment at home or in satellite unit. These estimates were based on EQ-5D values reported by de Witt (56). The scores for satellite and hospital HD were 0.81 (SE: 0.05) and 0.66 (SE: 0.04), respectively. The same study also reported a utility value of 0.81 (SE: 0.03) for PD. We assu med HD home would be assigned the same 83 Economic evaluation-Methods QALY weight as HD satellite (57;58), and that HD self-care had the same utility as HD hospital. 84 Economic evaluation - Results Economic evaluation - Results The prevalence of chronic renal failure and, thus, the need for dialysis is constantly growing. Given the limited capacity of existing dialysis units and the expected in- crease in demand for dialysis, it is essentia l to examine the feasibility of relying more heavily on outpatient treatment modalities, particularly because there appear to be few modality-related differences in treatment outcomes. In addition, the recent de- velopment of a portable home hemodialysi s machine could allow patients to move freely and lead normal lives. Based on this background, the main objective of the economic evaluation was to compare the effectiveness and costs of HD home, the most effective strategy, with the other dialysis modalities from both a societal and healthcare perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness estimates Health care perspective The results of the cost-effect iveness analysis from a healthcare perspective are pre- sented in Table 36. This ta ble provides information on the incremental cost and in- cremental effectiveness of HD home comp ared with the other dialysis modalities. The gain in utility from HD home compared with the other modalities was not sub- stantial and the difference in effectiveness is mostly caused by the increase in sur- vival of HD home compared with the other modalities. Over a five-year time horizon, HD home dominated both HD hospital and HD satel- lite, i.e. it was both more effective and less co stly. HD home in comparison with HD self-care and PD was more costly and mo re effective, with incremental cost- effectiveness ratios of NOK 1,651,099 an d NOK 4,344,526, respectively. The ICERs were clearly above the suggest ed threshold for cost-effect iveness of NOK 588,000. 85 Economic evaluation - Results Table 36: Results of the base-case cost-effectiveness analyses from a healthcare perspec- tive (discounted); HD home versus HD hospital , HD satellite, HD self-care and PD: peritoneal dialysis Societal perspective Table 37 illustrates the results of the base-c ase analysis from a societal perspective. From a societal perspective and during the considered time horizon, HD home dom- inated the other hemodialysis methods, i.e. HD hospital, HD satellite and HD self- care, (both less costly and more effective). HD home also was more effective and at the same time, more costly relative to PD . The incremental cost per effect for HD home compared with PD was estimated at NOK 2,657,211 which is again clearly above the suggested threshol d value of NOK 588,000. Total costs (NOK) Results Table 37: Results of the base-case cost-effectiveness analyses from a societal perspective (discounted); HD home compared with Hospital, Satellite, Self-care Hemodialysis PD: peritoneal dialysis Sensitivity analyses Healthcare perspective We performed Monte Carlo simulations with 1 000 draws from the input distribu- tions for both perspectives (healthcare an d societal perspective). Results of the simulations are presented as scatterplots in the cost-effectiveness plane and as cost- effectiveness acceptabilit y curves (Figure 12-15). The incremental cost-effectiveness scatterp lot and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve from a healthcare perspective are show n in Figure 12 and 13. In Figure 12, HD home is the origin, and the dotted line presents one possible threshold for cost- effectiveness (WTP), here set at NOK 5 88,000 per QALY gained. In Table 38, we have presented the percentages of simulations that are in each quadrant of the plot and also below and above the WTP-line. Th e simulated ICERs for HD hospital and HD satellite were mostly located in upper left quadrant; i.e. they are dominated by HD home (47% and 68%, respectively). At the same time, the simulated ICERs for HD self-care HD and PD were mostly located in lower left quadrant below the WTP- line (66% and 88%, respectively). Total costs Figure 12.

EVPPI analyses were performed with 100x100 iterations. The EVPPI of different groups of parame- ters (costs, efficacy, QALYs and probabilities) are presented in Figure 16. EVPPI was highest for cost data for all valu es of WTP, which indicates that the cost parameters have the greatest impact on de cision uncertainty. These results suggest that if new research is to be undertaken, additional information on cost parameters would contribute most to reducing the un certainty surrounding the decision about which treatment modality is most HD Selfcare HD 91 Economic evaluation - Results Figure 16.

Each parameter estimate was varied, individually, within reasonable bounds in order to investigate the impact on the results. We performed one-way sensitivity analyses separately for each comparison (HD home compared with the other dialysis modalities). Co mmonly the results were most sensitive to changes in distance per trip for different dialysis modali ties, the mortality rates, cost of dialysis supplies, number of dialysis sessions per w eek, personnel cost (healthcare staff sala- ry per month and standard number of working hours), travel cost per mile, overhead cost, and choice of discounted rate.

The top 10 variables in tornado diagram of hemodialysis hospital compared with hemodialysis home Scenario analyses As previously noted in this report, we coul d not identify good qu ality utility data and because neither meta-analysis found significant quality of life differences based on dialysis type or treatment setting, we applied a single QALY weight based on the best available data in base-case analyses. Howeve r, some studies observe that quality of life tended to be higher for patients treated in satellite units or treated at home. We performed scenario analyses to test the assu mption of a potentially higher quality of life associated with treatment at home or in satellite unit. The correction factor had a very small effect on the results as treatment at home (PD and HD home) already was more cost-effective than the other dialysi s modalities. However, HD satellite would experience increased costs and effectivene ss relative to HD hospital from both a healthcare and societal perspective), with cost-effectiveness ratios of NOK 967,600 and NOK 725,700 per QALY gained, respecti vely, which is still above the suggested willingness to pay of NOK 5 88,000. The conclusi on remained the same as in the original analysis. 93 Discussion In this HTA we have systematically revi ewed and summarized 18 studies examining adult patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) performed at different locations, specifically, hospital, ho me, satellite units or self-care in hospital. We focused on the impact on mortality, co mplications that require special measures (i.e. hospitalisation and antibiotic treatment) and quality of life. We have further performed an economic evaluation to examine the relative cost-effectiveness in a Norwegian setting of di fferent dialysis modalities (HD hospital, HD self-care carried out in hospital, HD sa tellite, HD home and peritoneal dialysis) from both healthcare and societal perspectives in patients with end stage renal dis-ease. Summary of results Clinical We found no significant differences in mortality (PD home versus HD hospital, and for HD home versus HD satelitte); quality of life (PD home versus HD hospital) or in infections between the two types of peritoneal dialysis. The quality of the documentation was low. We found significantly fewer hospitalis ation days per patients per year in the HD hospital group than in the PD group. The quality of the documentation was low. All other comparisons had very low documentation quality. Of 21 possible comparisons only six had published data. The efficacy outcome used in the economic evaluation was mortality. Although the result showed no significant difference, there was a trend in favour of HD home. Economic evaluation From a healthcare perspective: HD home was the dominant strategy relative to HD hospital and HD satellite (more effective and less costly). HD home 94 was more costly and more effective th an HD self-care and PD although the incremental 1, 651,099 and NOK 4,344,526, respectively) were clearly above the suggested threshold for cost- effectiveness of NOK 588,000 per QALY gained. From a societal perspective: HD ho me dominated all other hemodialysis modalities (i.e. HD hospital, HD self -care and HD satellite). HD home was more costly and more effective relative to PD, but the IC ER (NOK 2,657,211) was above the sugg ested threshold. The results of our sensitivity analysis sh owed that cost data had the greatest impact on the results' uncertainty. Quality of documentation/model The quality of the efficacy and safety documentation was assessed using GRADE. This tool helps us to systemat ically assess issues that may have an impact on our confidence in the accuracy of the estimates/results. As we only identified two small RCTs and used observational studies for ou r review, several issues lower our confi- dence in the estimates of effect. We assessed the documentations from the two RCTs to be of low quality. The documentation from the observational studies had low and very low quality. In the GRADE system outcome documentation from observational studies starts at low quality. Our cost-effectiveness analysis showed that there is some uncertainty around the estimates. Most of the decision uncertainty arises as a result of uncertainty in the cost data, making it most reasonable to conduct further research on these parame- ters. Strengths and weaknesses of this report A strength of this HTA report is the use of a systematic literature search to identity all relevant articles. Furthe r, data extraction, quality assessment and data-analyses were all done by one person and controlled by another to redu ce the likelihood that important information was overlooked. The strongest limitation is the low quality of the research docume ntation. Thus there is an uncertainty in the estimated effects, both whether observed differences are real or whether no differences is due to poorly designed studies. Most of our documentation re garding effectiveness of th e different dialysis modali- ties came from observationa l studies. Because observational studies are not based on 95 randomizing patients to different groups an d hence, lack a random distribution of known and unknown factors among the groups , they are normally deemed to have a greater potential for differing patient charac teristics across groups at baseline. We have however only assessed studies that ei ther reported that groups did not differ significantly in comorbidity at baseline or provided enough baseline details for us to conduct tests for those differences. Differences in comorbidity at baseline could have influenced the results of comparisons of di fferent dialysis modalities. The testing we have done to ensure no significant differe nce in comorbidity at baseline for the com- pared groups is therefore pivotal. Had this information been lacking, we would not have been able to distinguish differences reflecting different study group character- istics from differences reflecting the different interventions. We limited our literature search to studies performed after 1995 because erythropoi- etin was introduced about that time. This shift in treatment may have had a clinical impact on the estimates of effect so focusing on this treatment regimen helps to en-sure that the included studies are more comparable to current treatment. Comparison of different dialysis modalities , as we have done, has both strengths and weaknesses. The strengths may be that such information is needed. The number of people with end stage renal disease has be en increasing in recent years and is ex- pected to increase in the future (5;59) . Knowledge of the advantages and disad- vantages of different types of dialysis and pl aces of delivery may help to ensure bet- ter organization of care in the future and may aid in making better choices about the appropriate treatment for each patient. Today most dialysis is hemodialysis in ho spitals (40). There is an ongoing discus- sion, possibly reflecting the wishes of both patients and health authorities, about moving (or shifting) dialysis treatment from hospital/satellite to home (5;60). The thought is that this would be more conven ient for the patient and less expensive for the community. The decision/recommendat ion to shift dialyses from hospital and/or from satellites to home should be based on documentation that ensures effi- cacy, safety and cost-effectiveness. A study like ours is designed to examine if this is the case. However, in the ca ses in which individual patients are not suited for one type of dialysis, it should be possible fo r patients and their physicians to choose a suitable dialysis modality based on each pa tient's clinical status, preferences and ge- ographic limitations. For this HTA we were asked sp ecifically to focus on the type of dialysis and the de- livery location. Consequently, we coul d not examine differences in dialysis frequency, dialysis adequacy, residual functi on or dialysis equipment, all of which could have influenced our results. However, the examined outcomes (mortality, 96 complications that require sp ecial measures and quality of life) were all important (final outcomes) for the patient. When comparing efficacy and safety we normally prefer to use data from random- ized controlled trials. However, we found on ly found 2 RCTs (14;19) out of our 4336 abstracts, which may be an indication that randomized controlled trials may not the be the most appropriate desi gn for studying different ty pes of dialysis. The reason for this could be both the strong wish fr om the patient for a specific treatment as well as the routines of the health professionals. The recruitment problems in Ko-revaar et al. 2003 (19) provide some support for this possibility. While we were una- ble to include many RCTs in our HTA, we have included 16 controlled observational studies with numbers of patients ranging from 28-11,238. Observational studies are recognized as a better mirror of real life effectiveness. Another weakness in our HTA is the quality of the documentation. This was low for six outcomes, but for the majority of outc omes the quality was very low. A natural explanation for this is that most of th e documentation came from observational studies that start at low quality when using GRADE, and as soon as we had one rea-son to downgrade in GRADE the quality fell to very low. According to GRADE we have limited confidence in the effect estimates of low quality. However, since it has been shown to be very difficult to perform randomized controlled trials for this type of patients, we believe that our results from observational studies with low quality are, in practice, the best possible we can obtain for this type of treatment. Limitations of the health economic model To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evalua tes the relative costs and effects of all dialysis modalities from both the healthcare and societal perspec- tive. It does, however, have a number of important limitations. Any simulation model is a si mplification of real life. Moreover, although we have tried to find the most robust and best evidence available, the data used in the model have limitations. Therefore limitations a ssociated with the input data and the sim- plifications of our health economic model should be considered when interpreting the results. Lack of data comparing different hemodialys is modalities (with regard to treatment setting) was the most important limitation of this study. This limi tation was relevant to all parameters, i.e. effect, quality of life and costs. 97 Little research exists examining the costs of different dialysis modalities in Norway, making it difficult to obtain reliable co st information for the different modalities, particularly home and satellite, and with regard to geographical conditions and ex- isting infrastructure in diffe rent regions. We discuss below specific ways in which the cost assumptions we used in the model may be less than ideal. Although we have tried to conduct our analysis based on best available data, and have incorporated uncertainty around cost estimates in the sensitivity analysis, the cost estimates need to be treated with some caution. HD home and HD satellite units may requir e more skilled nurses than a hospital unit to compensate for the limited clinical staff. We did not include the costs of more skilled nurses or training of additional nurses in our analysis. Lacking specific data, we assumed that the cost of consumable supplies was the same for HD hospital, HD satellite and HD se lf-care. It is possible, however, that the cost of supplies varies across settings. The level of staffing for each modality may vary in different regions. Satellite care staffing, for example, could vary between th at found in standard hospital units and that found in minimal care facilities. Thus, the variation in care level can have an impact on costs and cost-effectiveness estimates. For HD home, we included the costs relate d to use of the new generation of home HD machine. Based on clinicians' opinio ns, these new machines can improve use and reduce both complication rates and th e costs associated with installation and reconstruction. Travel costs were difficult to assess becaus e different portions are borne by patients, hospitals and public health care system. Unfortunately, none of the Norwegian Re- gional Health Authorities had a system that specifically registered travel costs relat- ed to dialysis treatment. Our analysis is therefore based on information obtained from dialysis centers across the country ab out the average distance travelled to hos- pital or satellite units. Based on expert opinion, we included in our analysis only costs for treatment of ma- jor complications, that is, those requiring special measures and ho spitalisation. This included costs related to treatment of peri tonitis for peritoneal dialysis, and access related infections and percutaneous coro nary interventions (AMI and angina) for hemodialysis. Costs related to more mi nor complications were not included. 98 We did not include the costs related to loss of production in our analysis as we as- sumed that most dialysis patients are of re tirement age. However, we believe that including the cost of lost pr oduction may improve the cost-effectiveness for patients who are treated at home. We performed a systematic literature search to identify the best possible evidence on utilities for our model. The search did not identify any single study or combination of studies reporting the utility values measured by a common in strument for all types of dialysis. Lacking good-quality utility data (preference-based health related quality of life data) for our study population, we applied a single QALY weight for all types of dialysis, based on a non-randomized Swedish study, which attempted to control for case-mix between PD and HD patients (53) . However, because one could imagine that home or satellite dialysis patients might experience a higher quality of life than hospital hemodialysis patients, we performed scenario analysis to test of the implica- tion of a potentially higher quality of life associated with these modalities. The cor- rection factor, however, had a very small e ffect on the results and the conclusion in terms of cost-effectiveness was unchanged. As mentioned earlier, effect estimates used in the model were mostly based on ob- servational studies with low or very low quality of the evidence. Therefore, the effi-cacy estimates are associated with uncertainty. In several cases, efficacy parameters used in the model are based on meta-analyses with no significant results. In this analysi s we have used efficacy estimates whether or not the meta-analysis is statistically significant. In health economic evaluation it is a common practice to include no signif icant differences because, effect estimates themselves are considered to be the most likely outcome, and because it is assumed that the probability distributions represent the actual uncertainty. Our results compared to other HTAs or economic evaluations Efficacy and safety We can compare our results with publications from 2003 from Great Britain (58) and from 2006 from Denmark (60).The fo llowing site compar isons are possible: PD versus HD hospital We found no significant difference in mort ality between the groups. This we found both in one RCT (19) where we assessed the qual ity of the mortality documentation as low, and our meta-analysis of five obse rvational studies (12;16;17;21;26) where we assessed the mortality documentation as ve ry low. The Danish MTV has also studied 99 this comparison. They concluded that the RCT did not have sufficient power to con- clude (38 patients). In our GRADE assessme nt we have also downgraded Limitation in Design by 1 to reflect this fact. The Danish MTV included several observational studies that show conflicting results. Four American studies ( 44;61-63) all showed that HD patients had longer survival than PD patients. Other (non-American) stud- ies concluded the opposite, that PD patients had better survival than HD patients, at least for the first time after start of dialysis (64-67). We used none of these studies in our assessment. The reasons for exclusions were either treatment period (before 1995) or th at the localization for HD was not known. For more details see Appendix 2, Table III. It is noteworthy that none of the five ob- servational studies (12;16;17;21;26) that we included were included in the Danish MTV. The reason for this is that three of those (12;16;21) were published after 2006, i.e. after their literature search; Vigneau et al. 2000 (26) is written in French (they only included studies in English and Scandi navian languages). It is unclear why they did not includ Jager et al. 2001 (17), an article reporting the Dutch NECOSAD I study. Our contact with the authors reveal ed that the hemodialysis was done in hos- pital. Number of hospital days We found significant fewer hospital days in the HD group than in the PD group. This is in agreement with findings reported in the Danish MTV (over a five year period the PD patients are hospitalized 10 days more than the HD patients). They based their results on a Danish re gister from 1990-2003 (68). HD home versus HD satellite We found no significant differences between the groups in mortality as well as hos- pitalisation due to vascular access and hosp italisation due to congestive heart fail- ure. The quality of these outcomes was very low. The HTA from 2003 from Great Britain (58) conducted similar comparisons to those in our HTA. They found that HD home was generally modestly better than HD satellite for survival and hospitalisation. For mortality they used nine studies (69-77). All had treatment period before 1995 and were therefore excluded in our analysis. We have included Johansen et al. 2009 (18) and Weinhandl et al. 2012 (27), which were not in cluded in the British HTA be- cause they stopped their literature search in 2001. For hospitalisation they used two studies (78;79), which we considered but excluded. We excluded Mohr since that had cost as the main focus (they also looked at quality of life, but we excluded due to time before 1995 and because the locati on for HD was not known). We excluded 100 Bremer because of a treatment period before 1995. We have included Johansen et al. 2009 (18); this was not included in their HTA, since they stopped their literature search in 2001. Health economics We identified one HTA report that examined the cost effectiveness of dialysis in dif- ferent treatment settings in the UK, but it was limited to comparisons of hospital, home and satellite treatment among hemodialysis patients (58). Economic modeling indicated that home hemodialysis dominate d hospital hemodialysis, that is, it was less costly and more effective in terms of qu ality-adjusted life years. Relative to sat- ellite treatment, home hemodialysis provided additional QALY benefits at a modest additional cost, \u00a32215 and \u00a33914, respective ly at 5- and 10-year follow-up. However, we should mention that the costs of dialysi s in different countries are difficult to compare because of different price systems and dialysis funding policies. Additional-ly, the defined patient groups ( e.g. age, comorbidity, etc.) differed between studies. We also found an HTA report from Denmar k (60). Their review of the literature showed no significant differences in life expectancy between the various dialysis methods. Thus, their health economic evalua tion was limited to cost considerations, where the expected development in numbers and distribution of dialysis patients were simulated over a 10-year period. The results showed that it would be cost- saving for the healthcare sector if the prop ortion receiving outpatient treatment rose from 30% to 40-45%. Implications for practice Our clinical results indicated no significant differences between the groups for mortality and quality of life (PD versus HD hospital) and for infections (APD versus CAPD, but significantly fewer hospitalisation days per pati ents per year in the HD hospital group than in the PD group. The quality of the documentation was low. It is therefore not possible to be certain which dialysis modalities should be preferred from an efficacy and safety point of view. The result of our health economic analysi s showed, however, that home dialysis mo- dalities (PD and HD home) were the most co st-effective choices for dialysis patients, especially from the societal perspective. If home dialysis is not possible, it should be possible for patients and their physicians to choose a suitable dialysis modality based on each patient's clinical status and preferences. 101 Conclusion All five dialysis modalities were almost equally effective in our analysis. When ef- fects are combined with cost, hemodialysis at home was the most cost-effective al- ternative among the hemodialysis options. Peritoneal dialysis was the least expen- sive and hence the most cost-effective alte rnative compared to all hemodialysis mo- dalities. Need for further research We acknowledge that performi ng randomized controlled studies in this population is difficult, but urge trialists to do their best to match study groups as well as possi- ble and describe possible confounders. There is considerable uncertainty around the cost estimates. Therefore, it is most reasonable to conduct further prospective studies on the costs associated with dif- ferent dialysis modalities in Norway. 102 References 1. The Norwegian Renal Registry.

The Provision of Dialysis Services in Rural and Remote populations in Newfoundland and Labrador. Not according to our PICO, but we checked 3 of the primary studies from this: (Greneche 2005: not relevant due to design; Walsh 2005: no control group and Lee 2002: not our outcome) From Dacetha: Sundhedsstyrelsen, 2 SR: Mowatt 2004: Our search included Mowatt 2004, this we have excluded of reasons given above in table 1. Jacobs 1995: Our search did not include this. We have checked and found that the study period here was before 1995, ie out. 3 original studies comparing mor- talitet between CHD and HHD: Mailoux LU 1996 (this is not in our interest since the study period from 1970 through 1993) Woods 1996 (this we had in our search, but we have excluded since treatment period from 1986-87) Arkouche 1999 (this we had in our search, but we have excluded since treatment period from 1974-97) Center HD vs selfcare HD in center Here they found no literature.

Later we found that the patient groups in this study differ sig- nificantly in comorbidity between groups, and hence we have only mention this in our Appendix. Vonesh 2004: this we did not have, we have checked, this is not of our interest due to unk own localization. Fenton 1997: This we had in our search, excluded due to treatment period 1990-94. Schaubel 1998: This we did not have in our search. Have checked, exclude due to treatment period 1990-95 Collins 1999: This we did not have in our search. Have checked, exclude due to treatment period 1994-96 and localization not stated Heaf 2002: This is a Danish register study from 1990-99. This we have excluded both since we do not know the site(s) for HD. ie: we exclude the Danish MTV, since we either had already their studies, or their studies were not of our interest, except for one study (Jaar) that we have added as an manual searched article in our HTA. 135 Appendix 3- Studies not assessed d ue to either lack of comorbidity data or significant difference in comorbidity data between the pa- tient groups Author, year/ study type Number of patients (total in study) Outcome(s) Lack of comorbidity Data Significant difference in comorbidity Comments PD versus HD hospital Bayoumi, 2010 (80) 200 QoL X No adjustment for comorbidity in analyses.
