However, some anti-inflammatory supplements may work better than others. Inflammation is the body's response to irritation, infection, and injury. Short term inflammation protects the body, while chronic inflammation can lead to long term pain and damage, such as in arthritis. Anti-inflammatory medications help fight pain and chronic [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279298/) In this article, we describe some of the most effective anti-inflammatory supplements that people may wish to try, depending on the cause of their inflammation. [Omega-3 fatty acids](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35914448/) These supplements may help fight several types of inflammation, including vascular inflammation. Vascular inflammation is a significant risk factor for [heart disease](/articles/237191.php) and [heart attack](/articles/151444.php). Like many prescription anti-inflammatory medications, omega-3 fatty acids and fish oil may increase the risk of bleeding. People with bleeding disorders and those taking blood thinners should not use this supplement. [Curcumin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34378053/) [ginger](/articles/265990.php) family. [Multiple studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8572027/) There are a few studies that showed curcumin alone was as than the NSAID diclofenac. Although it is safe to take curcumin with low doses of NSAIDs, higher doses may increase the risk of bleeding. Curcumin also increases the risk of bleeding in people taking blood thinners and those with bleeding disorders. [S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e)](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/complementary-therapies/supplements-and-vitamins/supplements-for-arthritis) is a substance that the body creates naturally. It [plays an important role](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00056.2014) in the epigenetic regulation of genes. Epigenetic factors affect gene expression and behavior, turning some genes on or off and changing the effect of others. [Doctors sometimes recommend SAM-e](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00056.2014) to manage symptoms of [depression](/kc/depression-causes-symptoms-treatments-8933), osteoarthritis, and certain liver conditions, as inflammation may play a role in each of these. [Some clinical trials](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/complementary-therapies/supplements-and-vitamins/supplements-for-arthritis) have suggested that SAM-e may help relieve the pain and inflammation associated with various types of [arthritis](/articles/7621.php) \u2014 sometimes as well as NSAIDs can. [The right dosage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/s-adenosylmethionine) depends on the condition a person has. SAM-e may interact with a wide range of drugs, so people must not take it without first consulting a doctor. Some research suggests that zinc is a potent anti-inflammatory that may support the immune system and reduce several markers of inflammation. According to a [2017 paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28353636/) [including cancer](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/8416763/). Several studies have suggested that supplementing with zinc may reduce infection rates by approximately [66%](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2014.00014/full) among elderly participants. The r [ecommended daily intake](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/) Zinc may interact with [calcium](/articles/248958.php), diuretics, and certain [antibiotics](/articles/10278.php), so people must talk to a healthcare provider before trying this supplement. [Doctors have long suspected](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6675604/) [green tea](/articles/269538.php) may fight inflammation, because people who live in regions that consume more green tea have lower rates of inflammation-related illnesses. Research suggests that green tea may inhibit the production of certain inflammatory chemicals. It may also help [slow cartilage loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33126483/) However, help [reduce cartilage loss](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/complementary-therapies/supplements-and-vitamins/supplements-for-arthritis) and reverse autoimmune symptoms. Per the Arthritis Foundation, it is a fast acting supplement that may help with osteoarthritis pain in just 7 days. The usual dosage is an extract containing 30-40% boswellic acids, which a person takes in [250-500 mg doses two to three times per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563692/) [may increase its potency](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29316908/) Frankincense is typically safe, with few side effects. However, some people report stomach pain and gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea. Capsaicin is the ingredient that gives hot peppers their heat. Substance P is a pain transmitter produced by the body. Capsaicin [temporarily reduces substance P](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6273101/) It is typically available as a topical cream or patch and some research suggests that capsaicin may help with both [nerve and muscular pain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6272969/) Capsaicin can irritate the skin and eyes, so it is essential to wash the hands thoroughly after use. Cat's claw comes from various uncaria plants, including Uncaria tomentosa and Uncaria guianensis. Research suggests that cat's claw may reduce various forms of inflammation. It is [especially effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548323/) [Although cat's claw is generally safe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3011108/) [lupus](/info/lupus/). It may also cause nausea, though an older animal study suggested that it may have a protective effect against gut inflammation induced by the NSAID indomethacin. Anti-inflammatory supplements do not work for everyone. In almost all cases, these supplements take time to reverse inflammation. So, people who need immediate pain relief may want to try other options, either in addition to or instead of anti-inflammatory supplements. Some options include: - Over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatory drugs: such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and [aspirin](/articles/161255.php)can help with inflammation-related pain. They may also reduce the swelling of a recent injury. - Prescription anti-inflammatory drugs: A wide range of prescription medications can help with inflammation and pain. For a more long-term solution, another option is to try an [anti-inflammatory diet](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/foods-that-fight-inflammation). Some people focus on eating foods that reduce inflammation, while others avoid those that may trigger inflammation. Below are some frequently asked questions regarding natural anti-inflammatories. What is the strongest natural anti-inflammatory? Several supplements have natural anti-inflammatory properties, including omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin, S-adenosylmethionine, and zinc. The efficacy of these supplements can vary depending on a person's health and the underlying cause of inflammation. Which vitamin is the most anti-inflammatory? As part of a nutritionally-balanced diet, vitamins A, D, and E, can all have potent anti-inflammatory properties. What can I take daily to reduce inflammation? Daily supplements, including omega-3 fish oil, curcumin, zinc, green tea extract, and S-adenosylmethionine, may all help reduce inflammation. Always talk with a medical professional before taking new supplements to check for possible interactions. Natural anti-inflammatory supplements can help the body fight pain and inflammation. They may even prevent some of the long term complications of chronic inflammation, such as cancer. Before trying a new anti-inflammatory treatment, even a natural one, it is important to consult a doctor. Natural remedies are often potent medicine that can cause side effects and interact with other drugs. When they work, however, they may reduce the need to take prescription or OTC medications. "}
