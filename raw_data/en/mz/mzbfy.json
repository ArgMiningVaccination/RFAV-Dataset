Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in some of your body's most vital functions. In addition to supporting skin health and your immune system, vitamin C also works as an antioxidant that protects your cells against potential damage ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional) Vitamin C deficiency is rare in developed countries, but inadequate intake of the vitamin can lead to symptoms like dry skin, achy joints, bleeding gums, and poor wound healing ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional) If you smoke, have kidney disease, take certain medications, or consume a very limited diet, you may be at an increased risk for vitamin C deficiency ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499877/) Vitamin C can be found in a variety of whole, plant-based foods like citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries, and broccoli ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/) Obtaining nutrients from whole foods is the preferred approach, but if you have difficulty meeting your nutrition needs for any reason, you may need to take a supplement. The supplements on this list were chosen based on quality, manufacturing standards, usability, and price.

Thanks to its antioxidant properties, it has been found to have several benefits, particularly for skin and immune health. Found concentrated in the skin, vitamin C boosts collagen production and helps protect from UV damage ( [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805671/) The most commonly known benefit of vitamin C, though, is for immune health, particularly as it relates to the common cold. Some research has found that supplementing with vitamin C can shorten the duration of a cold and may help prevent and treat other infections, such as tetanus and pneumonia. But more human studies are needed ( [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28353648/) Additionally, a systematic review found that vitamin C supplementation was effective in lowering blood pressure in people with hypertension ( [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32080138/) Preliminary research also suggests that vitamin C has anticancer properties and that a high dose supplement could potentially be used as an alternative treatment in people with cancer ( [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30967651/) [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33278349/) [8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33182353/) Other research has been investigating the use of vitamin C supplementation in people with stress-related disorders, such as depression and anxiety, because it has been shown to help improve mood. However, more research is still needed overall ( [9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32745879/) When shopping for a [vitamin C supplement](/nutrition/vitamin-c-benefits), you'll want to consider quality, dose, and price. You'll also want to decide on the form of supplement you're interested in, such as chewable tablets or a powder. Quality Evaluate whether a brand is reputable by exploring its ingredient sourcing and looking for companies that abide by the current Good Manufacturing Processes established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To ensure that a product contains what it says it does, it's best to look for one that's tested by a third-party organization, such as [United States Pharmacopeia (USP)](https://www.usp.org/), [Consumer Lab](https://www.consumerlab.com/), or [NSF International](https://www.nsf.org/). Finally, it's also worth looking at the ingredient list and choosing a product that's free of artificial additives or preservatives. Similarly, if you're trying to limit your intake of added sugar, you'll want to avoid sweetened supplements. Dose A very important consideration is the [dosage](/nutrition/how-much-vitamin-c-should-i-take-daily), since vitamin C supplements come in a wide range of doses. For most healthy men and women, it's recommended to consume 90 mg and 75 mg of vitamin C per day, respectively ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/) However, some people may benefit from a higher dosage of vitamin C. If this is the case, it may be more economical and convenient to find a concentrated supplement. This way you won't be stuck taking multiple servings of a lower dose option. Generally, high doses of 1,000 mg or above are unnecessary and could contribute to unwanted side effects. Consume high doses only if your doctor recommends doing so ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/) Price Some professional-grade brands can be expensive, but keep in mind that a higher price doesn't necessarily mean a better product. There are plenty of high quality options available at various price points. Form Vitamin C supplements are available in several forms, including: - liquids - chewable tablets - swallowable pills - powders If you prefer to take a pill, you'll want to check out encapsulated vitamin C supplements. However, if you don't like swallowing pills or want to mix the supplement into beverages, you'll want to purchase a liquid or powdered product. A note on price General price ranges with dollar signs ($-$$$) are indicated below. One dollar sign means the product is rather affordable, whereas three dollar signs indicate a higher price range. Generally, prices range from $0.02-$1.48 per serving, or $14-$35.60 per container, though this may vary depending on where you shop. Gummies and liquid formulations generally have a slightly higher price per serving than tablets or powders. Note that serving sizes vary by product.

Some of the most common reported side effects include ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499877/) - headaches - flushed skin - nausea - vomiting Consuming high doses above 1,000 mg per day of vitamin C for prolonged periods may also increase your risk for [kidney stones](/health/kidney-disease/vitamin-c-and-kidney-health) ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499877/) In one large study, taking 1,000 mg of vitamin C per day was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing kidney stones in men ( [15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26463139/) Always consult your doctor prior to adding any nutritional supplement to your routine. Should you take vitamin C daily? If you're eating a balanced diet rich in nutritious ingredients, like fruits and vegetables, taking a vitamin C supplement likely isn't necessary. However, taking a vitamin C supplement daily may be beneficial for people who are at [risk of deficiency](/nutrition/vitamin-c-deficiency-symptoms), including people who ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional) - smoke - have health conditions that decrease their absorption of vitamin C - follow restrictive diets that may not provide enough vitamin C How much vitamin C should adults and children take? The recommended daily amount of vitamin C for adults is 90 mg for men, 75 mg for women, and up to 120 mg for people who are pregnant or nursing. However, certain medical conditions may require that you take much higher doses ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional) Children have lower vitamin C requirements, ranging from 25-75 mg per day, depending on their age. However, healthcare professionals generally do not advise giving children a vitamin C supplement unless their pediatrician has recommended it. Note that the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for vitamin C for men and women ages 19 years and older is 2,000 mg. That said, some people experience side effects with frequent and prolonged intake of 1,000 mg per day ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499877/) [15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26463139/) Meanwhile, the UL for children ranges from 400-1,800 mg, depending on their age. Daily intakes at or below these amounts are unlikely to result in any negative health effects ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional) What is the best form of vitamin C to take? Though most vitamin C supplements come in the form of ascorbic acid, several other types are also available. Mineral ascorbates, such as sodium ascorbate or calcium ascorbate, are less acidic and may be preferable by people who experience digestive side effects when taking regular ascorbic acid. However, there is limited research on whether these forms are actually more well-tolerated ( [16](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-C/supplemental-forms)). Meanwhile, liposomal vitamin C is a form encapsulated in liposomes, a small vesicle made from cholesterol or other phospholipids. These supplements can help increase the absorption of vitamin C, but they are also often more expensive ( [14](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32901526/) [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4915787/) Some supplements also combine vitamin C with other flavonoids, such as citrus extract. While some research suggests that this could boost vitamin C absorption, other studies have turned up mixed results ( [16](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-C/supplemental-forms)). Can vitamin C hurt your kidneys? Excess vitamin C is excreted from the body through urine in the form of [oxalate](/nutrition/oxalate-good-or-bad), which is an organic acid ( [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946963/) High amounts of oxalate can build up in your kidneys, which can increase the risk of kidney stone formation ( [19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30566003/) For this reason, people who are prone to kidney stones are advised not to take high dose vitamin C supplements ( [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946963/) What is the best natural food source of vitamin C? Vitamin C is found naturally in many fruits and vegetables, such as ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499877/) - red and green peppers - oranges - strawberries - broccoli - grapefruit - kiwis - tomatoes However, some cooking and storing methods can reduced the vitamin C content of these foods, so it's a good idea to opt for raw or steamed fruits and vegetables when possible ( [1](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499877/) Useful supplement shopping guides Check out these two articles to help make supplement shopping a breeze: Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that plays a diverse role in keeping your body healthy. Although vitamin C deficiency is rare in developed countries, it can cause serious health concerns that, if left untreated, could be fatal. If you have trouble getting enough vitamin C from your diet, supplements are a great option. They come in a variety of physical forms, dosages, and price points. Always consult a healthcare professional prior to adding any new supplements to your health and wellness regimen. "}
