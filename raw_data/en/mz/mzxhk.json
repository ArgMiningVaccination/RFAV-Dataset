[You can find part I here](https://notenoughspoons.blog/how-do-you-know-its-endo/). Looking back, there are a few things I should have realized when I had my first laparoscopic surgery. Like how the doctor said that \"it's just outpatient surgery, you'll heal quickly and can go back to work in a couple days\"... ...but that didn't include how you use your abdominal muscles for literally every movement, you'll bleed like a heavy period because she messed with your reproductive organs, and there was a chance she was taking an organ out of you (which, she did). The first fun part of laparoscopic surgery was practically being kicked out of the hospital - no help changing, no liquids, no food. I had to ask for post-surgical instructions, but they did remember the wheelchair. I would have been completely unprepared if it weren't for Nancy's Nook. I'll put these links right at the top, because if you're having laparoscopic surgery then you must prepare: I was weak from an insufficient diet for the previous year, and my teacher husband unfortunately couldn't take off work. My mom came and helped one day, and a friend came to help another day. So I did survive, but it wasn't easy. I slept in a recliner for awhile, and in bed on my side after that. David had to help me get out of bed until I could use my abdomen just enough to push up with my arms. During nighttime bathroom visits I had to wake him up or hope I didn't hurt myself practically falling out of bed. I had bone broth, I cooked all my veggies, I made smoothies, and I started working only a few days later. I was a freelancer at the time, so I was able to be really flexible. Even a month after surgery, I had to be careful what I ate or bowel movements caused far too much pain. Three months after my surgery, I finally felt like I had enough energy to leave the house by myself. Finally, about six months after surgery, I felt like myself. I didn't have to be careful of tender wounds. But time wasn't the only thing that helped me heal. Surgery is the gold standard of care for endometriosis, but it is only step one. I am still learning this lesson. The problem is that it takes time and money to tackle this. One thing at a time... Read more: One surgery to rule them all... First, I decided to commit to being vegetarian, and practically vegan really. Once in awhile I bake with eggs, and I sometimes sweeten my tea with honey. But if you don't like meat or fish and can't eat dairy, what's left that isn't vegan anyway? A month after surgery, I found a naturopath in San Antonio to visit. While surgery is the gold standard, taking care of your health naturally is an important step for pain management and overall health. I was able to do a free phone consultation with the naturopath and found that, while not listed on her website, she has worked with people who have endometriosis or something similar (like fibromylagia and PCOS). She would work within my budget as best as possible and recommended diet changes, supplements, and acupuncture. We could also look into a [DUTCH test](https://dutchtest.com/) for hormones and homeopathic remedies. My nautropath was \u2014 is \u2014 willing to work with me over time, as my body changes. I went to meet her and tried acupuncture. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it's only when my next period comes that I feel the effects with a less painful cycle. From the start, we were testing. Her diet recommendations included: - Gluten free - lots of research suggests many women with endometriosis do better on a gluten free diet and experience less pain - Organic, whole foods diet - Omega 3 fatty acids, including fatty fish (salmon, herring, anchovies), nuts, seeds, flax oil, chia seeds, walnuts - Fermented foods for GI health \u2014 kombucha, kimchi, sauerkraut, kefir (careful with dairy), olives, pickles - Variety of colorful fruits and vegetables \u2014 eat the rainbow! - No/low sugar and simple \u2014 try to keep sugar less than 20mg per meal of snacks - Avoid: trans fats, alcohol, caffeine, processed foods as much as possible - Iron rich foods Since I was essentially starting my diet from scratch, I started here. What do I feel like eating, and how can I use this list to feel full and healthy? I learned how to cook a LOT of new things, but that's another post. My naturopath also had lifestyle recommendations: - Yoga, meditation, acupuncture, pelvic therapy, abdominal massage [Castor oil packs](https://www.healthline.com/health/castor-oil-pack#how-to-make-one)twice weekly to help move toxins into the bowel and decrease inflammation. Does some of this seem weird? Yes. But what I have learned in the last few years is that regular doctors don't listen and can make things worse. Meanwhile, my naturopath has immensely reduced my daily pain, fixed a rash a doctor made worse, and healed an ankle pain I'd had for months with a few sessions of acupuncture. Just because it's new to me doesn't mean it isn't important. I trust this woman, and she works with me. She always says to tell her if something doesn't work so we can try something else. I don't do acupuncture as often as I'd like, but it helps. I'm a weepy, angry mess the rest of the day, but it does decrease my pain. When I tell her what's bothering me, she sticks me with needles to help decrease it. Luckily, I already practice yoga and have been working on meditation (personally, I love the [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) app). While I hadn't been to the yoga studio ( [they are great](https://www.lokayogastudio.com/), if you're in SA, check them out!) as often because of all the pain I had been having, I had enough skills to practice safely on my own. The castor oil packs gave me minimal relief for all the trouble, so I have since stopped using those. The final piece of the puzzle (for now) was supplements. Look, you can go to any store and get vitamins. But if you work with a naturopath or doctor to determine what you need, and get high-quality supplements, you will get better results. I know this for a fact. Both on purpose and on accident. I have taken a full bottle of some of these vitamins then purposely paused for a week when they ran out. But the inflammation, anxiety, and pain all increased. So I resumed taking them. Then there was the time I was too depressed/anxious to order refills for four supplements. And the aftermath included literally curling in a ball with my cat in a dark room and crying. Never again. I'm not sharing my full list of supplements here for numerous reasons. But know that Vitamins A, B, C, D and E are included. Plus a few to help with specific hormone imbalances due to endometriosis, Turmeric with [Curcumin](https://nancysnookendo.com/curcumins-effect-on-endometriosis/) to help with inflammation, and high-quality probiotics for gut health. She also included 1 TBS flax oil 1-2 times a day or 1 TBS of flax seeds daily to help with hormone balance. This works great in a smoothie! While some supplements I took only for a few months, most I still take daily. If I miss a dose or two, I'm usually okay. In general, my supplements and diet support each other. I think this is important. If you eat pizza and burgers every day, supplements won't fix you. And sometimes a healthy diet just isn't enough. A holistic approach to your health, however, makes a huge difference. After all of this, my body felt a little better! Except when it didn't. There are times when I'll eat something I shouldn't and I'm in pain later. Or I forget to order my supplements. Or I just have a bad cycle. Sometimes though, other strange things have happened. My in-laws have a pool in their backyard, and every summer we're there to swim on the weekends. One week I used whatever sunscreen they had with no problems, as I usually do. But the next week I broke out in a rash. Same sunscreen. Same body parts. Over the next few weeks, I tried all the sunscreens they owned, one at a time. I even bought a sensitive skin sunscreen \u2014 but I broke out in a rash with that too. Before I gave up and determined to swim in long sleeves and leggings, I researched natural, non-toxic/chemical-free sunscreens. I hesitated, but, in the end, even a [natural sunscreen](https://gimmethegoodstuff.org/safe-product-guides/sunscreen/) is less expensive than a wet suit. I've tried a few kinds now, and I never break out. In fact, I don't tend to get sunburned anymore. [Badger](https://www.badgerbalm.com/collections/mineral-sunscreen) is great, as are [Alba Botanica](https://www.albabotanica.com/products/category/sun/) and [Goddess Garden](https://www.goddessgarden.com/store/#daily). Because of this, I've also begun switching out everything else I use on my body, and even some cleaning products. When your body changes week-to-week, it seems like a must. You can save money by finishing what you have now and buying a natural product when you're ready for more face wash, shampoo, cleaning spray, etc. There was one more odd thing that I didn't think mattered at first. In fact, it took me a year and a half to try to fix it. I'm still waiting, but that too is another post. We went to a march the summer of 2020. It was June 27 \u2014 I remember because that's our anniversary. The Saharan dust cloud was hitting us that day, but I'd never had breathing problems before. In the aftermath of [George Floyd being kille](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/us-george-floyd-protests-saturday/index.html) [d](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/us-george-floyd-protests-saturday/index.html) [, attending a march](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/us-george-floyd-protests-saturday/index.html) seemed important. And it was, but I had no idea that later that day I would feel like I couldn't catch my breath. And that now two years later I'd still be feeling the effects as the breathlessness came more frequently. That sometimes all I can do is lie down on my back with my feet elevated to breathe properly. But first, I had to deal with the increasing pain again and the knowledge that I did still have endometriosis all over my uterus. In fact, maybe this was happening because I had [thoracic endo](https://nancysnookendo.com/thoracic-endometriosis/) too? I really don't know. Once I was ready, I called a surgeon. This time, I followed the advice on Nancy's "}
