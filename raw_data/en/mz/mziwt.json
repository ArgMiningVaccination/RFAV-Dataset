She's always had a love for people and a desire to help in some way. This desire later took her to Vatterott where she graduated from their Medical Assistant program. She went on to have a variety of jobs that all helped to shape and grow her in some way, and yet each left her craving something more. Crystal said, \"Chiropractic care has been an interest of mine for many years, and I just love the Docs here!\" Bring that all together, and she truly believes she's found her home at EFC. When Crystal isn't at work, you'll typically find her cycling down the highways, reading, or spending time with loved ones. "}
