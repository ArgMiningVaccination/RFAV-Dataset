By supporting balanced cortisol and a healthy stress response, Cortisol Manager also promotes relaxation to support restful sleep.* THE ROLE OF CORTISOL IN TIMES OF STRESS Cortisol is a hormone produced in the adrenal cortex that is released during times of stress. Variations in cortisol secretion can indicate how well the body is coping with stress. Cortisol homeostasis is typically characterized by peak secretion during the early morning hours with a gradual decline throughout the day. Because of its central role as a key stress hormone, cortisol is often thought of as a bridge between stress and its health impact. WITH HERBAL INGREDIENTS The ingredients in Cortisol Manager help support a balanced, adaptive cortisol response to stress.* Cortisol Manager contains a stress-reducing of Sensoril\u00ae brand ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and L-theanine.* A Magnolia officinalis) and epimedium (Epimedium koreanum), as well as phosphatidylserine from soy lecithin are included in Cortisol Manager. A 2008 placebo-controlled clinical trial showed that Sensoril\u00ae ashwagandha significantly reduced serum cortisol levels and helped manage stress compared to placebo, in subjects experiencing higher levels of stress.*1 The ingredients in Cortisol Manager help support relaxation to promote restful sleep.* They also help stabilize the stress hormone cortisol to further support a healthy stress response.* REFERENCES - Auddy B et al.

INTERACTIONS FAQS A: While some individuals do take Cortisol Manager\u00ae during the day, caution should be used as it will cause you to relax and drowsiness may occur. A: While the ingredients do have a modulating effect, the small scale study shows a rather significant reduction in cortisol levels. Therefore, we would not recommend Cortisol Manager\u00ae for someone with low cortisol. A: The source of the phosphatidylserine in Cortisol Manager\u00ae is vegetable glycerin. The glycerin, in turn, is derived from a highly purified, refined soybean oil, which contains no allergenic proteins. A: Yes. Cortisol Manager contains phosphatidylserine sourced from soy. If your patients require a non-soy formula, you may want to consider standalone soy-free phosphatidylserine. A: Though typically used within the early-stage of the stress response, Cortisol Manager can be used in the mid and late stages - particularly within the mid-stage when additional energy and stress support is needed.* The HPA Optimization program highlights key nutrient support that is appropriate for the mid and late stages, such as the adaptogenic herbal combination of HPA Adapt, for mid-stage, and CortiVive for late stage, which supports healthy cortisol production and healthy adrenal cortex function. A: No, not when used properly. Research has shown that ashwagandha offers safe and effective support for the body during times of stress.* Unfortunately, there are some sources indicating that all plants of the Solanaceae or nightshade family (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and ashwagandha, included) should be avoided because of their potential to reduce immune system function. However, many of these same plants and herbs have been used as food staples and medicines for thousands of years. These compounds, found in green part of the vegetables, may cause adverse effects in humans when taken at unrealistically high levels.
