Utilizing muscle testing, whole food nutrition, supplementation, and gentle chiropractic care, Dr. Maxfield and Becca Potter thoroughly assess and address health problems. We do this in two main ways: Muscle testing (or applied kinesiology) is an assessment technique that offers incredible accuracy. This process helps determine the root cause of any condition, as well as the right program to correct it. Our staff can test you against a number of stressors, including heavy metals, chemicals, food allergens, fungus, and bacteria. From there, we will use our findings to create your customized treatment plan. All our protocols are natural and non-invasive, but they also require discipline on the patient's part to achieve the best possible results. Chiropractic care is what we use to address the structural balance of the body. The nervous system is the 'master control' of the entire body. If there are any issues in the nervous system, like misalignments, pain, or inflammation, your systems and organs are directly affected. Not only does an adjustment bring your body back into alignment, reverse injuries, and prevent many surgeries, but you'll also feel the effects it has on your sleep patterns, hormones, digestion, stress levels, mental clarity, and more. We work hard to educate patients about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and understanding the reasons behind their health issues. We don't use medicine or surgery to cover up symptoms. Instead, we do everything naturally to support the body and allow it to function as it was intended. At Tennessee Alternative Medicine, it's our pleasure to discern what's causing the problem, and to help in whatever capacity we can. \"We strive to create a peaceful, healing environment for anyone pursuing a healthier lifestyle. Through education and support, we hope the quality of our patients' lives improves establishing a new legacy of healthy living.\" By cleaning out the body (detoxing) and providing it with great nutrients and additional supplementation, it is amazing how quickly a person can feel better. Many conditions that people develop are from different stressors, which can be physical, environmental, or emotional. At the office we concentrate on checking and managing the physical and chemical/environmental stressors. Chemical stressors that we specialize in testing for are heavy metals, chemicals, food allergies, viruses, parasites, bacteria, fungus, or even large scars that can affect your nervous system. Many of these could be triggering your health problem. We can help you achieve your health goals and reach optimal health!
