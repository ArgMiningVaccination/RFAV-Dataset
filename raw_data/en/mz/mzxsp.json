Is Water Birth Right for You? Alternatives to Water Birth During a water birth, a pregnant person can experience labor and delivery in a tub of warm water. A water birth can be at home, in a birthing center, or in a hospital that accommodates a water birth. Pregnant people who desire a birth without medication or epidurals sometimes choose water birth because it can in some situations provide a gentle experience says Ami Burns, a Chicago-based childbirth educator and writer and owner of Birth Talk. \"They find being submerged in a tub provides more comfort during contractions than being on land.\" But that doesn't mean water births are 100% pain-free either. In fact, labor pains are just as present in the water birth pools as they are anywhere else, but the environment tends to be more relaxing and soothing says David Ghozland, MD, an OB-GYN practicing in Santa Monica, California. Water births also come with a host of risks and potential complications, some of which can be serious. These range from infection and meconium aspiration to drowning. To clear common misconceptions, here's everything parents-to-be need to know about giving birth in water. Water Birth Pros and Cons When it comes to water birth, there are mixed reviews on its safety and whether or not it should be used as a pain reduction tool in labor or as a mode of delivery. For instance, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises against water births, given a lack of available data on the topic. They indicate that while immersion during the first stage of labor has benefits, there is insufficient evidence on the benefits and risks during the second and third stages of labor and delivery. Therefore, the ACOG advises that while laboring in water during the first stage of labor may be fine, birth should occur on land, not in water. By contrast, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American College of Nurse-Midwives support water births in certain situations. They also indicate that people who have an uncomplicated labor and delivery (and an uncomplicated pregnancy) have comparable maternal and neonatal outcomes whether or not they give birth in water. They feel pregnant people should be given the opportunity to remain immersed during labor as long as their health care provider feels it is safe. To make your own decision, keep reading for a closer look at the pros and cons of water birth. Pros of Water Birth Cons of Water Birth Helps ease pain Increases risk of Infection Reduces need for meds Poses risk of inhaling meconium Lessens risk of tearing Tears to umbilical cord can occur Shortens labor Poses risk of drowning Benefits of water birth explained Laboring in water, particularly during the first stage of labor, has become increasingly common. Choosing a water birth, or even just spending the first part of your labor in water, allows you to enjoy the advantages of being in a deep tub of warmth. Here are some potential benefits of water births. Helps ease pain: Some of the purported benefits of water birth include decreased pain and complications during delivery, thanks to the relaxing of the muscles and tissue and the buoyancy of the water, says Amber Ford Cottrell, a doula who practices in New York City. \"For [pregnant people] who are skeptical about water births, I always ask if they have ever taken a hot bath to relieve terrible menstrual cramps. That is usually the aha moment for most of them.\" Reduces need for medications: Barbara Harper, RN, founder of Waterbirth International, and Michelle Collins, CNM, an assistant professor of nursing at the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, explain there is a chemical and hormonal response during water births that impacts oxytocin and helps regulate the intensity of the contractions. As the body becomes buoyant more oxytocin is released and more pain-inhibiting endorphins flood the brain which could result in less need for medications. Lessens risk of tearing: What's more, Harper and Collins say water causes the perineum to become more relaxed, which can reduce the severity of vaginal tearing. In fact, one study compared 397 water births with 2,025 land births. It found that both birthing practices were equally safe and that those in the water group sustained fewer first and second-degree tears. Land births and water births also had comparable postpartum hemorrhage rates and neonatal intensive care admissions. Shortens labor: Researchers in one study found that water plays a role in shortening the duration of labor in all three stages. They note that this could be related to activity in the water, more relaxed muscles, and psychological factors. Additionally, another study concluded that not only are water births safe, but they are actually associated with better outcomes than land births. 10 Labor and Delivery Support Tips for Partners Water birth risks and complications explained For the most part, water births themselves are not significantly more dangerous than birth out of water, but when they take place at home\u2014and most of them do\u2014there is an increased risk. That's because there's usually no immediate emergency medical help with home water births. Here are some important water birth risks to know. Meconium aspiration: This medical term means a baby has had its first bowel movement before birth and inhales the contaminated amniotic fluid, which causes respiratory problems. Extra precautions have to be taken when the first bowel movement occurs prior to delivery and it may be difficult to clear the baby's airway with a water birth. There also is a risk of pneumonia, which is caused by meconium aspiration, fecal contamination, and bacteria from tub water. Drowning: Where there is water, there is a risk of drowning. An older review lists drowning and near-drowning, as well as asphyxiation as risks of possible water birth complications. The baby could possibly stay underwater too long and their lungs could fill up with water. In a medical environment with a water birth, your delivery team would help prevent this by placing the baby's head above water so they can get enough oxygen to breathe as soon as they are born. Umbilical cord tears: During a water birth, a baby is usually brought quickly to the surface, head first. This swift movement will enable them to start breathing as soon as possible, but there's a risk that the umbilical cord may snap. A snapped umbilical cord can be life-threatening because the fetus can bleed freely until it is stopped, says Patrick Weix, MD, PhD, an OB-GYN practicing in Irving, Texas. Additionally, short umbilical cords can tether the fetus underwater or tear, leading to fetal blood loss. Infection for baby: Water birth means sitting, pushing, and delivering in a tub\u2014which often includes feces in the tub. A baby born in that environment could possibly swallow the contaminated water, increasing their risk of infection. The likelihood of an infection is unknown but there is no way to make the water contaminant-free, says Dr. Francis. That's because the tub becomes contaminated with vaginal and rectal flora the minute a pregnant person sits in the tub, even if the water is sterile. Infection for parent: Depending on how long your own water has been broken and how long you are using water during labor, there is also a risk of infection in the uterus. For instance, most hospital guidelines stipulate that once someone's water has broken, the risk of infection rises significantly and the ACOG recommends delivery within 24 hours. Giving birth in the water at home increases the risk that you may not know fully when your water has broken and you may introduce bacteria to the water. Baby Dive Reflex Babies are genetically and physiologically programmed to take their first breaths of air, not water, within seconds of their head being delivered. They do have a \"dive reflex\" that instinctively closes their airway and prevents them from breathing in water, but a few scenarios may still cause them to inhale water: They are startled during birth. The head is brought to the surface before the rest of the body; this overrides the dive reflex. Their oxygen supply from the placenta is affected in some way. 'Freebirth' Is on the Rise But There Are Huge Risks Who Should Not Have a Water Birth? Aside from any rules surrounding the place you plan to give birth, there are other conditions a pregnant person will most likely need to meet to qualify for a water birth. There are certain circumstances in which someone should not choose water birth. Marra Francis, MD, a gynecologist practicing in San Antonio, specifies that people with group B strep-positive cultures, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, macrosomia, intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity, and an unproven pelvis should not have a water birth. Here are some additional scenarios that may disqualify you from having a water birth: You have a high-risk pregnancy.You have high blood pressure.You go into labor earlier than expected (under 37 weeks gestation).Your baby is breech.You are older than 35 years old.You are having more than one baby. \"High-risk conditions or complications in labor often necessitate continuous fetal monitoring or immediate intervention, which is better accomplished outside of the water,\" explains Edwin Huang, MD, an OB-GYN practicing in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Of course, always talk to your health care provider to understand the full risks and reality of your choices. Water birth is a very personal decision, one that requires much thought and research\u2014because there's more to water birth than the tub. Stages of Labor and Delivery: What to Expect When You Give Birth Is Water Birth Right for You? Knowing whether or not a water birth is right for you will depend on your unique situation and is a decision best made in collaboration with your health care provider. Together you can decide if you meet the criteria necessary for a water birth. If, after weighing the pros and cons, you want to try water birth, you will need to make a plan for where your water birth will take place. You also should consider what to do in the event of an emergency, particularly if you live far from a medical facility and plan to attempt water birth at home. \"Anyone thinking about delivering at home needs to think through the worst-case scenario for the ultimate safety of their baby and themselves,\" says Sharon Mikol, MD, an OB-GYN practicing in Cleveland, Ohio. Where to have a water birth When it comes to water birth, you have the option of at home, in a birth center, or at a hospital. Choosing a water birth in a hospital setting allows you access to state-of-the-art medical care if needed in an emergency. That said, not all hospitals are set up for or even allow laboring in water. For this reason, a number of water births happen at home or stand-alone birthing centers. Water birth centers are equipped with IVs, oxygen, medication, and infant resuscitation equipment, so if need be, emergency care can be started if transport to the hospital is needed. Even though birthing centers are not as common as hospitals, a quick search for \"water birth centers near me\" will give some results. The American Association of Birth Centers can also help you find a birth center in close proximity to you. The key is to make sure you meet the qualifications for a water birth and that you have a backup plan in place should your situation change. Alternatives to Water Birth If you are interested in how to reduce the need for pain medications during your baby's birth, but either do not qualify for a water birth or are concerned about the risks to your unborn baby, there are other things you can try to reduce your pain levels and shorten your labor. Here are a few things to consider (and discuss) with your health care provider: Experiment with water therapy such as a hot showerHave a birth partner, friend, or family member use massageTry acupressureUse a birthing ballExplore relaxation techniques or meditationMove around, walk, pace, squat, rock, sway, or dance Use warm compresses Practice breathing techniquesTry essential oils or aromatherapyPlay soothing music Updated by Lambeth Hochwald Was this page helpful?
