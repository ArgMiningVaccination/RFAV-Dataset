"cleaned_text": "all right isn't this wonderful it's nikki thomas in the afternoon kblx family we have another informative exciting conversation today and i'm sure you've been hearing it on the radio together we heal and it sounds amazing that's because it is amazing and we've got more of your questions answered today because we have an expert in the building she is dr navina baba from the san francisco department of public health how are you today i'm really i'm well thank you so much for asking it's my pleasure to be here i love it that we have a doctor in the house because all the questions that we have about covid about the vaccine it's so interesting it's an ongoing dialogue that's happening right now that's so important and the together we heal campaign is doing an excellent job of doing just that bringing the community together uh in an effort to heal and to provide the information and the resources that we need right now so tell us more about the together we heal campaign and how how it all began yeah i'm excellent um introduction about the together we heal campaign so the campaign is really an awareness campaign it was born out of the community and has really been community driven and led which makes it so exciting um it's an awareness campaign um that talks about how you know people within the community are protecting themselves and each other and their families and their community members all the actions that they're taking um and you know at the beginning of the pandemic this was included getting testing um and ensuring you know that they were masking and socially distancing and that continues and it's evolved to you know as vaccines have enrolled to getting vaccinated so um it it really highlights the unsung heroes the frontline people that are doing this work um and all of us in fact um in our in the ways that we are protecting each other um so it's a tribute to that it's a reminder of you know all that we've been through and where we've come and where we're going um so it's it's a campaign um that is actually it is centered on our communities that have been most impacted by cobit which includes our black african-american communities and our communities of color i love the idea of putting some extra on coming together at this time because it's one of the loneliest times because we could have a whole another conversation about how lonely it is to um speak to all the things that we've been through you know the lockdown the isolation the stay home the are there going to be enough supplies for me so the word together is just very powerful right now um so how is san francisco ensuring that equity plays a role in the distribution of the vaccines yeah you know one of the things that um again um the fact that you know that the the pandemic has really impacted our communities of color we were very intentional in how we rolled out vaccine um and we worked with our healthcare partners as well as our community partners to ensure that there was um access low barrier access to vaccine um and so our mass vaccine vaccination sites we intentionally set them up in more the southeast quadrant of the city so the market um city college and then also um and moscone um and south of market um all again very intentional that we wanted to make sure that the communities that were hardest hit by cobit also had first priority access to vaccine additionally um we've done a lot of neighborhood community um events um with our community-based partners to ensure that that um you know if people don't want to go to a big center that they have you know maybe a small local area that they would feel more comfortable going to um they have access to they can ask questions um and then obviously i'm partnering with the medical community because people really do trust their doctors um and want to get that one-on-one and so ensuring that vaccines um could be made available in healthcare systems as well okay so doctor i'm going to hit you with a bunch of the hardcore vaccine questions these are always my favorite because at a time like this it's like folks want like some definite answers and they want to make sure that they've got the facts straight so does the vaccine contain the live covet 19 virus what are the ingredients found in the vaccines and can these ingredients be found in other vaccinations medicines are things we use in our day-to-day lives so for the first question um none of the vaccines contain lime virus in fact none of the vaccines contain the entire virus almost all the vaccines have been developed from a piece of the virus that your immune system is able to respond to um so how i like to um think about this is what the what the vaccines do is it gives you a recipe to um for your body to defend yourself against cobia um and so if you think about it kind of as an analogy if the first time you've ever eaten cake and it's probably um you know many years for a lot of us but if you just think back to that moment if you thought well gee i want to make that that you had no recipe think about all the things that you would have to try to do right you have to try to figure out well it tastes a bit sweet so i should bring some buy some sugar and if you you know bought it or if you ate a chocolate cake you'd think oh maybe there should be some chocolate but most of us would probably have a disaster of a cake without a recipe right but and it's the same with the virus um the first time your body sees the virus it may not know what to do and it may um the virus may overwhelm it and that's why we get a lot of bad um outcomes from cobit but if we can give your body the road map of how to protect itself just like we need a recipe to make a cake um you will have a much better outcome in fact these vaccines are so effective that um you know the majority people don't get disease at all and the minority that do it's very mild disease so um that that is just one explanation and what we give you is one ingredient to um ensure that your body can protect itself against the vaccine so no lie vaccine and just one small ingredient that is taken from the virus but it's not live um and then in terms of the um actual what's in the vaccine um you're right that there are things in the vaccine but they're um there are inactive ingredients that allow um the vaccine to be viable um in terms of being able to get into your body um but these are all things that are found in normal everyday foods and medicines so most of us are exposed to these ingredient active ingredients on a regular basis um and they don't pose any harm unless there's one specific case if you have a specific allergic reaction to one of these ingredients it might cause harm but that allergic reaction is very rare wow i think i think the analogy about the cake was the best answer that i've heard in this entire pandemic oh uh seriously that's something that i was in the dark about and as you answered the question i was like oh wow everything made sense because we were seeing so many um stories at the beginning of the pandemic about the virus overwhelming the body and you know as we go along it just makes sense that you know the explanation that you just gave us it just it made everything make sense in my head that it's just excellent wow okay so what resources would you recommend for someone wanting to educate themselves and make an informed decision on getting vaccinated because that's what we're all trying to do right now yes um and i think there's a couple different resources i can point to um one is you know the cdc has guidelines the california department of public health has guidelines and our own um you know government um sf.gov has a lot of great resources um so i would say um those are all good places that to find good information and correct information the other thing that i would say is if you are listening to this and you've gotten vaccinated you are like one of the best people to talk about vaccine and why you got vaccinated to your loved ones um to your neighbors to your community if um you made that decision and what kind of compelled you to make that decision and why you felt it was the right decision to you because it is those one-on-one conversations that really um help to get the right facts out there um we also know that people trust their doctor and we are making um you know doctors available at our vaccine sites to answer questions so if you do have questions um and you're in san francisco we can definitely accommodate that but um i always think um the people that have gotten vaccinated and the choices of why they've decided to are one of the most powerful tools we have so i would really encourage you if you have questions to talk to somebody that's gotten vaccinated um or talk to your doctor and if you have been vaccinated to kind of spread the word amazing amazing i'm so glad that we get together for conversations like this because they really really allow us to feel empowered and also shift into a decision one way or the other um again there's so much information that we get i mean our phones are great technology but at the same time it can lead us down all these different rabbit holes and you just don't know which way to turn sometimes so this has been an amazing conversation and again i i feel like the weight has been lifted and now i see the light and everything is just coming together in in the brain right now so if you want more information you can go to sf.gov and all the things that we've talked about there's resources there's information so that you can make an empowered decision uh nobody likes to feel like somebody's making decisions for them um that's the other thing so again when we say together we heal it's not just a one option thing it is hey we're coming together for conversations and for information and to clear the air and to get uh the proper information um to everyone who wants and needs it dr navina baba san francisco department of public health thank you so much for this you don't even know it's almost like i feel like i i'm we're on facebook live and i'm in church too i feel like i'm in church because i'm like preach says preach this is amazing awesomeness again sf.gov kblx family for more information and for more resources together we heal i could not have said that better doctor navina baba thank you so much for your time today oh my pleasure thank you so much nikki take care thank you "}
