Young children are much more likely than adults to have adverse drug reactions, so giving your child prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medication - even \"natural\" or \"herbal\" medicine - is serious business. If your child [vomits](/health/conditions/vomiting-in-toddlers-and-children_11395) or develops a [rash](/health/conditions/visual-guide-to-childrens-rashes-and-skin-conditions_10332129) after taking medication, call the doctor. Also, be sure to save the number for Poison Control (800/222-1222) in your phone. Sometimes parents or caregivers find open bottles of medication near a child, and it's hard to tell whether any has been eaten. Call for help even if you're unsure. If your child has a severe reaction to a medication (becomes unconscious, has trouble breathing, or is having seizures), call 911 for emergency help right away. Don't take the time to call Poison Control or your child's doctor.

Here are some medicines not to give your child. Note that for a few of these medications, guidance varies for older kids. Read on to learn the details. Aspirin Never give your child aspirin or any medication containing aspirin unless their doctor instructs you to do so. Aspirin can make a child susceptible to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal illness. Don't assume that the children's medicines found in drugstores are aspirin free. Aspirin is sometimes listed as \"salicylate\" or \"acetylsalicylic acid,\" so read labels carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you're not sure whether a product contains aspirin. For [fever](/health/illness-and-infection/fever-and-your-baby-or-child_84) and other discomfort, ask your child's doctor about giving [acetaminophen or ibuprofen](/health/medicine-and-first-aid/whats-the-difference-between-acetaminophen-and-ibuprofen_12376). Unless your child's doctor specifically recommends you to: Advertisement | page continues below - Don't give [acetaminophen](/health/medicine-and-first-aid/acetaminophen-tylenol-dosage-chart_11886) to a baby younger than 3 months. - Don't give [ibuprofen](/health/medicine-and-first-aid/ibuprofen-dosage-chart_10334443) to a baby younger than 6 months. - Don't give your child acetaminophen if they have liver disease (talk with their doctor about an alternative). - Don't give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen if they're also taking other OTC medicines. - Don't give your child ibuprofen (without first talking with their doctor) if they're [dehydrated](/health/medicine-and-first-aid/dehydration-in-babies_11527) or vomiting or have [asthma](/health/conditions/asthma-in-babies-and-children_74), kidney problems, [an ulcer](/health/conditions/ulcers-in-children_1391377), or another long-term illness. Cold medicine The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) doesn't recommend OTC cough or [cold medicines for children](/health/illness-and-infection/age-by-age-guide-to-kids-fever-cough-and-cold-medicine_10315565) under age 6. Studies show that these medications don't actually alleviate symptoms in kids this age and can be harmful, especially if a child mistakenly gets more than the recommended dose. In addition to drowsiness or sleeplessness, [upset stomach](/health/conditions/stomach-ache-in-babies-and-toddlers_11529), and a rash or [hives](/health/conditions/hives-in-toddlers_11438), a child can suffer serious side effects from these medications, such as rapid heart rate, convulsions, and even death. Every year, thousands of children across the nation end up in the emergency room after swallowing too much cough and cold medicine. Some pediatricians advise against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to any child up to age 12 (especially if the child has an underlying medical condition) because of these risks and the lack of data proving these medications are effective in children. Another concern is that your child could accidentally receive a double dose of these drugs if you give them a separate fever reducer in addition to the cough and cold medication. (OTC cold and cough products usually also contain pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.) If you decide to give your child an OTC cold and cough medicine, read the label carefully to make sure they don't end up getting more acetaminophen or ibuprofen than they should. If your child is miserable with a [cold](/health/illness-and-infection/colds-in-toddlers_11417), you may want to try using a humidifier or other [home remedies.](/health/illness-and-infection/safe-home-remedies-for-your-childs-cough-cold-or-flu_10014077) You can also ask your child's doctor for ideas to help them feel better. Anti-nausea medication Don't give your child a prescription or OTC antinausea medication unless the doctor specifically recommends it. Most bouts of vomiting are pretty short-lived, and kids usually handle them just fine without medicine. Also, antinausea medications may have side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, impaired coordination, headache, dry mucus membranes, constipation, blurred vision, heart palpitations, and decreased urine output. Still, your child's doctor may recommend one - based on your child's age and needs - if your child is in danger of dehydration from vomiting, or if they suffer from [motion sickness](/health/medicine-and-first-aid/motion-sickness_1744740) that doesn't respond to non-medication treatments, for example. If your child's vomiting and begins to get dehydrated, contact their doctor for advice about what to do. Also talk with your child's doctor if your child routinely becomes nauseated (while traveling, for example). Adult medication Giving your child a smaller dose of medicine meant for an adult is dangerous. Some medications aren't appropriate for children in any amount. Always use the dispenser packaged with a medicine, and if the label doesn't list the dose that corresponds to your child's age and weight, don't give them that medication. Medication prescribed for another person or condition You may feel lucky when you have some leftover medication from another illness and it matches what the doctor's just prescribed for your child. But prescription drugs intended for other people (like a sibling) may not work or may even be dangerous when given to your child. The same goes if the medication was given to your child for a different illness or condition. If your child's doctor recommended you give your child diphenhydramine (Benadryl) to reduce the symptoms of an allergic reaction, for example, don't give it to your child at a later date to help them sleep (because you noted it made them sleepy). Only give your child medicine prescribed for them and their specific condition. Anything expired Toss out medicines, prescription and OTC alike, as soon as they expire. Also get rid of discolored or crumbly medicines - basically anything that doesn't look the way it did when you first bought it. After the use-by date, medications may no longer be effective and can even be harmful. In general, it's not a good idea to flush old drugs down the toilet because they may contaminate groundwater and end up in the drinking water supply. However, a few drugs are so potentially harmful to children, pets, and others that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends flushing them down the toilet rather than putting them in the trash. If you're not sure how to handle your unwanted medications, ask your pharmacist, visit the [FDA's information pageOpens a new window](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/safe-disposal-medicines/disposal-unused-medicines-what-you-should-know) on this topic, or read our article on [how to dispose of expired medicine safely.](/health/medicine-and-first-aid/how-to-dispose-of-medicine_10334444) Syrup of ipecac Never use syrup of ipecac. If you or any of your child's caregivers - such as grandparents or other relatives - have syrup of ipecac in the house, dispose of it right away. Syrup of ipecac causes vomiting, and parents used to be encouraged to keep some on hand in case of poisoning. But doctors no longer recommend syrup of ipecac - and it's no longer available for OTC or prescription use - because there's no evidence that vomiting helps treat poisoning. And vomiting after swallowing poison can actually be harmful - if the poison contains an acid that can damage the upper gastrointestinal tract or airway, for example. The best way to prevent accidental poisoning is to keep potentially harmful substances locked up and out of sight. Chewables Chewable tablets or other kinds of medicine in tablet form are a choking hazard for babies and toddlers. Kids as old as 2 or 3 may choke on the tablet, so keep an eye on younger children while they're taking chewable medicine. Most 4-year-olds can handle chewable tablets, especially the kind that dissolve quickly. If you're worried about choking, ask the doctor or a pharmacist if it's okay to crush the tablet first and put it in a spoonful of soft food, like yogurt or applesauce. (Make sure your child eats the entire spoonful to get the complete dose of medicine.) Teething creams and gels If your child is miserable while [teething](/health/teething-and-tooth-care/teething-signs-and-symptoms_10357437), you may be tempted to turn to an OTC teething cream or gel. But these contain unsafe ingredients and give only a little relief for a short period of time. Many of these products contain benzocaine, a local anesthetic. It can lead to serious side effects, such as methemoglobinemia, in which the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen is greatly reduced. Teething creams and gels can also numb the back of the throat, interfering with your baby's ability to swallow. Because they wash out of a drooling baby's mouth quickly, they're not much help for teething pain, either. Instead of medications, give your [baby teething toys](/baby-products/bath-time/best-teething-toys_40008480), cold washcloths, or other safe solutions to [ease teething pain](/health/teething-and-tooth-care/parents-say-teething-solutions_11957). Tips for medication safety - Carefully administer the correct dose. Use the dispenser that comes with the medication, and give your child the exact amount as directed on the label or by the pharmacist or doctor. - Find out whether the medication should be given with or without food. If it says to take on an empty stomach, give it to your child one hour before or two hours after a meal. - If your child misses a dose of medication, don't give them two doses to catch up. - Check the packaging on OTC medications for tampering. The package shouldn't be torn or cut. Check the expiration date, too. - Make sure you keep all medications out of the reach of children. Keep safety caps locked. - Don't encourage your child to take medications by telling them it's candy or tastes good. When giving medicine to your child, getting the proper dose down isn't always easy.
