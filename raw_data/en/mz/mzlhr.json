Alternative medicine and health behaviorsRoughly one in ten French people [see an alternative medicine practitioner](/statistics/1111598/frequency-of-alternative-medicine-consultations-in-france/)ten times a year, and half have already [consulted an osteopath](/statistics/1101949/medicine-non-conventional-consultation-personal/)at least once in their lifetime. The [reasons for resorting to alternative medicine](/statistics/1101928/medicine-non-conventional-perception-france-consultation-reason/)are manifold and range from a desire to complement conventional treatments to a complete rejection of traditional medicine. The main [reasons for not relying on alternative medicine](/statistics/1101825/reasons-not-to-turn-to-alternative-medicine-in-france/)are the absence of need and the cost of such treatments. Also, 24 percent of French people have already [questioned a doctor's diagnosis](/statistics/1101886/medicine-conventional-perception-france-doubt-question-alternative/)based on the advice of an alternative medicine practitioner and [stopped taking a treatment prescribed by a doctor](/statistics/1101910/medicine-non-conventional-perception-france-replacement-treatment/), replacing it with alternative medicine instead.

These are alternative medicine types officially recognized by the French Medical Council (CNOM). Osteopathy is a technique that aims to detect and treat functional disorders through physically manipulating muscle tissue and bones. According to a [survey](/statistics/1113767/osteopathy-benefits-for-the-health-france/), around 85 percent of French people believe in the health benefits of this practice. The [second most popular type of alternative medicine](/statistics/1102019/homeopathy-perception-in-france/), homeopathy, is based on the pseudoscientific belief that it is possible to treat a patient by very strongly diluting substances that, if concentrated, would cause symptoms similar to those being experienced. France is notably the home to [Boiron](https://statista.com/study/73062/boiron/), the world leader in homeopathic products. After a long debate, the French government announced in 2019 that French social security will gradually stop reimbursing patients for homeopathic treatment until 2021. The French National Authority for Health (HAS) concluded that homeopathic medicines were of insufficient efficacy to justify reimbursement. Despite this decision, only 11 percent of French people think that [beneficiaries of alternative treatments should cover "}
