Such areas of growth include the abdomen on the ovaries and fallopian tube as well as the bladder, bowel, vagina, cervix, and the area betw een the vagina and rectum. The misplaced tissue builds up, breaks down, and sheds like the tissue that lines the uterus during menstrual cycles. However, the misplaced tissue has no way of exiting the body which results in internal bleeding, inflammation, bowel problems, infertility, scar tissue formation, and adhesions. Symptoms Infertility Fatigue Painful urination before periods Painful bowel movements during periods Pain with sex Pain before and during periods due to severe cramping, heavy menstrual flow, and periods lasting > 7 days Diarrhea Constipation Nausea Prevalence About 1 in 10 women in the U.S. have endometriosis. About 176 million women world wide have endometriosis. Symptoms usually occur during reproductive age (12 -60 years old) but most women are often undiagnosed. Source: endofound.org 4 Overview of Endometriosis Causes There is no identified cause for endometriosis. Theories related to genetics suggest that it may be carried in genes so some families may be more predisposed to it than others. Another theory has found it to be present at fetal development and activated du ring puberty. A retrograde menstruation theory suggests that menstrual tissue can back up into the fallopian tube, implant in the abdomen, and grow which can lead to the development of endometriosis. Lastly, there has been a link between the body's inflamm atory response and endometriosis but the mechanism behind this theory is not well understood. Treatment To confirm diagnosis, a laparoscopy is performed which will show the location, size, and extent of the growths. The gold standard for treatment is laparoscopic excision surgery to remove the growths. However, there is no cure for endometriosis.

Vegetables 4-5 svg/day Fruits 1-2 svg/day Healthy cold -pressed oils (Extra virgin, canola flaxseed, nut - based oils), 2-4 svg/day Fish, seafood 3-5 if necessary) 3-5 Low -fat Dairy (Dairy -free if necessary) 3 Alcohol , caffeine & sweets 1-2 svg/week 6 Vegetables: How much? 4-5 servings per day minimum (one serving = 2 cups salad greens, \u00bd cup vegetables cooked) Healthy Sources: Dark leafy greens (spinach, collard greens, kale, Swiss card), cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, bok choy, cauliflower), carrots, beets, onion, peas, squashes, washed raw salad greens Why? Vegetables are rich in flavonoids and carotenoids with antioxidant and anti -inflammatory properties. Ai m for a plate that's colorful in vegetables to get a wide variety of vitamins, including A, E, and C as studies have shown these vitamins to be lower in endometriosis patients. Fruits: How much? 1-2 servings per day (one serving = 1 medium size piece of fruit, \u00bd cup chopped fruit, \u00bc cup dried fruit) Healthy Sources: Raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, peaches, nectarines, oranges, pink grapefruit, red grapes, plums, pomegranates, blackberries, cherries, apples, and pears all have lower glycemic index. Why? Fruits are rich in flavonoids and carotenoids with antioxidant and anti -inflammatory properties. Aim for variety in color to get a wide variety of nutrients , including A, E, and C. When possible, choose organic for reduced pesticide residue that ha ve been associated with hormone imbalances. Fish and Seafood How much? 3-5 servings per week (one serving = 4 oz. of fish or seafood) Healthy Sources: Wild Alaskan salmon, herring, sardines, and black cod Why? Fish is rich in Omega -3s which are anti -inflammatory. Choose higher fat, deep -sea fish as they have greater intakes of Omega -3s. Lean Meat, Poultry, Eggs How much? 3-5 servings per week (one serving = 3 oz. of poultry or skinless meat) Healthy Sources: High quality skinless poultry, turkey, grass -fed lean meats, free -range eggs Why? Lean meats are lower in saturated fat to better control cholesterol levels. 7 Beans and Legumes How much? 2-4 servings per week (one serving = \u00bd cup cooked beans or legumes) Healthy Sources: Black beans, chickpeas, black -eyed peas, and lentils Why? Beans are rich in folic acid, magnesium, and potassium and soluble fiber. They are a low -glycemic -load food s to stabilize blood sugars. Red Meat How much? 1-2 servings per week (one serving = 3 oz. of cooked meat) Sources: Beef, steak, pork , veal Why? Limit these types of foods as red meats are shown to be pro - inflammatory and cause hormone imbalances. Choose grass -fed or organic meats. Cold -Pressed Vegetable O ils How much? 2-4 servings a day (one serving= 1 teaspoon of oil) Healthy Sources: Extra virgin olive oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, flaxseed oils, nut -based oils Why? Oils are high in Omega -3s and antioxidants which are anti - inflammatory. They are also rich in monounsaturated fats that raise good cholesterol (HDLs) and lower bad cholesterol (LDLs). Expelled cold -pressed oil is best since it is not chemically treated and heated at lower tempe ratures to extract the oil. When cooking with oil, use lower temperatures as higher temperatures increases the production of trans fat. Where to use? Drizzle cold -pressed oils on salads, over vegetables for roastin g or saut\u00e9ing, or even popcorn! Mix organ ic butter with a cold - pressed oil for a healthier spread. Nuts and Seeds How much? 1-2 servings a day (one serving = 2 walnuts, 1 tablespoon of flaxseed, 1 oz. of avocado, 1 tbsp . of peanut Healthy s, ground flaxseed, pecans, hemp seeds, avocado, natural peanut butter, chia seeds Why? Nuts and seeds are high in Omega -3s which are anti - inflammatory. They are excellent sources of B -vitamins in addition to phosphorous. 8 Whole Grains How much? 3-5 servings a day (one serving = \u00bd cup cooked grains) Healthy Sources: Brown rice, basmati rice, rice, buckwheat, quinoa, oats , gluten -free noodles or pasta Why? Whole grains have added B -vitamins with added fiber to promote a healthy digestive tract and reduce spikes in blood sugar that promote inflammation. Low -fat Dairy or Dairy Alternatives How much? 3 servings a day (1 ounc e of cheese, 8 ounce serving of milk /dairy -free milk , 1 cup of yogurt) Healthy Sources: Low -fat cheese s (Swiss, mozzarella, parmesan), fat - free yogurt, cottage cheese, skim or 1% milk . You can find dairy -free options of these foods as healthy dairy alternatives. Why? Vitamin D has been shown to reduce pro -inflammatory cytokines that contribute to possible inflammation associated with endometriosis. Choose organic dairy products to reduce the amount of hormones added to your foods. Alcohol, Caffeine, Processed Foods, and Sweets How much? 1-2 servings per w eek, sparingly Sources: Processed foods, fried foods, fast -food, caffeine in sodas or sugary sweetened beverages, alcohol Why? These types of foods have no nutritional value and added sugar which can prevent other vital nutrients from being absorbed. Caffeine and alcohol have been thought to impair ovarian function, aggravate PMS symptoms, and negatively affect infertility. Sweet s are pro - inflammatory and should be limited. What to eat instead? Healthier sweet substitutes can include small servings of dark chocolate, dried fruit, f rozen yogurt, and fruit sorbet. Water How much? 8-8 oz. glasses of water, half a gallon (64 oz.) Sources: Pure water, or drinks that are mostl y water , such as tea or sparkling water with lemon. Why? Water is vital for overall proper functioning of the body and removes metabolic waste products . 9 Organic or not? Research has shown that pesticides like organochlorines , organophosphates, bipyridines have been associated with decreased antioxidant capacity of fruits and vegetables. In addition, organochlorines have been shown to negatively affect hormonal pathways. VS. Foods on the \"Dirty Dozen\" list have the greatest amount of pesticides while foods on the \"Clean Fifteen\" list have the least amount. In order to consume a wide variety of fruits and vegetables for optimal nutrition, choose organic produce when purchasing fruits and vegetables from the Dirty Dozen list to reduce pesticide exposure. 10 Hidden Hormones in Your Food Dairy and meat products have added hormones that may be linked with hormone imbalances in patients with endometriosis. However, the nutrients from these food s, such as protein, Vitamin D, calcium, and iron are important components of a well -balanced diet. To reduce the amount of hormones in your foods, choose organic milk or dairy -free milk and grass -fed beef. What constitutes organic? Below are the USDA organic regulations: Managed without antibiotics, added growth hormones, mammalian or avian byproducts, or other prohibited feed ingredients (e.g., urea, manure, or arsenic compounds) Livestock that is allowed year -round access to the outdoors for grazing Raised on certified organic land Fed 100% certified organic feed Managed in a way that conserves natural resources and biodiversity 11 Which fats are the most anti -inflammatory? Flaxseed has the highest Omega -3 concentration followed by canola and soybean oil. The goal is to consume and use fats that have lower saturated fat and a higher Omega -3 to Omega -6 ratio to reduce rates of inflammation associated with endometriosis. 12 Omegas by the Mouthful Check out the foods listed below to see which are the best sources of Omega -3s to help reduce inflammation. Foods with a longer red line have larger amounts of Omega -3s. Fish has a greater amount of Omega -3s compared to other sources of meat. The goal is to co nsume a variety of seafood and add in lean lamb, grass -fed beef, and skinless white meat chicken as good protein sources with larger amounts of Omega -3s and lower fat intake. 0% 50% 100%Lamb, leanVenisonLamb, grass fed, YolkChicken, dark met, with skinBeef, lean, grain-fed Percentage of Omega -6s vs. Omega -3s Assorted Meat & Protein Foods Omega 6 Omega 3 DHA or EPA 0% 50% 100%Flounder or of Omega -6s vs. Omega -3s Assorted Fish and Seafood Omega 6 Omega 3 DHA or EPA 13 Omega 3 Supplementation Past research has shown that Omega 3 supplementation in the form of EPA & DHA can improve rates of fertility and reduce oxidative stress as a cause of inflammation. Omega -3 supplementation is increasingly being prescribed to patients with endometriosis. Discuss with your doctor if this is right for you. A feasibility study was conducted on different fish oil supplements to compare their costs and benefits. The ProOmega liquid f orm is the best deal as it will last the longest for a tot al of 48 days compared to the others that range from 20 -30 days. Most expensive 14 Elimination Diet and Endometriosis To help manage painful symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and cramping that can be associated with endometriosis, certain foods can be eliminated fro m the diet that worsen these symptoms. Research has shown that a gluten free diet can lead to dramatic pelvic pain reduction in women suffering with endometriosis. These may include: 1. Dairy contains a sugar called lactose that may be difficult for some women to breakdown and digest , causing cramping, diarrhea, and pain . 2. Gluten is a protein found in grains and wheat products which has been shown to cause diarrhea, abdominal pai n, and bloating in women with gluten sensitivity. Gluten can cause malabso rption of vitamins and minerals that regulate hormones. Gluten, also can cause inflammation and induce autoimmune reactions that attack hormones and hormone receptors. 3. Added sugars in processed foods , such as packaged or prepared foods , soft drinks an d baked goods , can increase inflammation. If you experience any of these symptoms, you may be a great candidate for the Endo Elimination Diet. Discuss with your doctor and dietitian to make the best plan for your health moving forward. 15 The Endo Elimination Diet The goal of an elimination diet is to remove all foods that could be linked to making your symptoms worse . There are two phases in an elimination diet. 1. Phase 1 - Elimination: Over the course of 2 weeks, you will remove all dairy, gluten, and added sugars and consume only the foods approved on pages 4 -5. 2. Phase 2 - Challenge: Over the course of 4 weeks, you will slowly reintroduce these foods back into the diet. You will track your symptoms and discuss them with your doctor and dietitian to see which foods your body can tolerate. How to be successful at following this diet? 1. Learn more about endometriosis before starting the Endo Diet. These books have been recommended by the Endometriosis Association as great reads to provide a more co mprehensive overview of endometriosis.

Interpret your results: Look at the symptoms recorded in your journal . What foods triggered your symptoms and in what amounts? What foods were safe for you to eat? Discuss with your dietitian about how to evaluate your symptoms moving forward. Change your diet: Avoid foods that trigger your symptoms during the challenge phases. Focus on consuming a well balanced diet without triggering your symptoms. 25 The Basics of a Healthy, Well Balanced Diet Since there is no specified cause for endometriosis, it is important to adhere to a diet that focuses on variety and balance for optimal nutrition. The focus should be on consuming a diet balanced in all five groups, including fruits, vegetables, dairy, protein, and grains. Aim for half of your plate to be filled with a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. These are high in vitamins and antioxidants to reduce inflammation. Make half your grains whole grains. Vary your protein by adding in plant -based protein like beans and legumes to lower red meat consumption. Look for food and drink sources that are lower in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars. Choose low -fat or fat -free dai ry. Incorporate healthy fats like Omega 3's found in avocado, fish, nuts, and olive oil to reduce inflammation. Get active at least 30 minutes a day which has been shown to reduce ovarian stimulation and estrogen production. 26 References /Webs ites Endometriosis (2016).
