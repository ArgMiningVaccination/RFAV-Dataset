Listener Q&A My Recommended Teeth Care Tactics...37:20 Harrison from Australia asks: I was listening to your recent [Vice Debunked podcast](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/lifestyle-podcasts/vice-article-wellness/) and was particularly interested in the topic of activated charcoal in toothpaste. I've recently taken a deep dive into holistic dental care, using only sea salts, sodium bicarbonate and essential oils to keep my mouth hygiene and health strong. I'd like to know what your oral care routine looks like, and what are your thoughts on fluoride, calcium carbonate, artificial sweeteners like Xylitol, and just toothpaste ingredients in general. In my response, I recommend: [Holistic Dental Care: The Complete Guide to Healthy Vitamin D/K [EWG Database for choosing a toothpaste](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) How To Biohack Night Shift Work...55:10 Melissa from Ontario asks: I work on call with very unpredictable and sometimes long hours. A few times a month, I work overnight. Because of the nature of my work, I can't predict which nights I'll be working overnight in advance. I've been devoting 5-6 days per week to crossfit training for the last 2+ years. While I'm trying to make progress with fat loss and muscle gain, I understand that lack of sleep and irregular sleep hinders these goals. I've also heard it can cause cancer in some people. I was wondering if you can provide some insight as to how I can minimize the damage of my chosen profession on my overall health. In my response, I recommend: [Podcast #229 on limiting damage from night shift work](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/biohacking-podcasts/229-how-to-legally-boost-hematocrit-limit-the-damage-from-night-shift-work-the-dangers-of-vasectomies/) [Re-Timer](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/re-timer)(code: BGF30 for $30 off of for 20% off) for a Longevity Remedy](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/ben-recommends/sleep/doc-parsleys-sleep-remedy-natural-sleep-powder/) [CBD](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/ben-recommends/brain/water-soluble-hemp-extract/) Natural Remedies For Prolonged Periods...01:08 Mike in Graham, WA asks: My fianc\u00e9 seems to suffer unusually long periods of menstruation. Her periods typically last for 7 days and longer, and they are often very painful. She is strong-willed and skeptical of doctors, thus she has resisted the urgings of myself and her close friends to see a doctor about this issue. Do you have any insight on natural ways to treat this issue, and how I can best support her in making the right decision for her long-term health?
