To Weigh Over-The-Counter Sale Of Contraceptive Pills ](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/fda-contraception-pill-hra-pharma.html) More than 60 years after the approval of oral contraceptives revolutionized women's sexual health, the Food and Drug Administration has received its first application to supply a birth control pill over the counter \u2014 just as the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v.

A Paris-based company, HRA Pharma, announced on Monday that it asked the F.D.A. to authorize its pill, which is available by prescription, for over-the-counter-sales in the United States. Cadence Health, another pill manufacturer that has been in close dialogue with the F.D.A. about switching its pill to over-the-counter status, said it hopes to move closer to submitting an application in the coming year.

[ The Wall Street Journal: Doctors Struggle With State Abortion Restrictions At Odds With Federal Law ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/doctors-struggle-with-state-abortion-restrictions-at-odds-with-federal-law-11657445400) Doctors and hospitals are rushing to reconcile laws in their states barring abortion with a federal law that may require the procedure as part of emergency treatment. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, laws have taken effect, or soon will, in several states that prohibit abortions except when necessary to save a pregnant women's life. Yet under federal law, doctors and hospitals may need to perform the procedure in other medical emergencies, such as for women at risk of kidney failure from an infection.

Other litigation is proceeding in more politically mixed states, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina, which all have pending cases that could create state constitutional protections for abortion. Courts could play a decisive roll in all three states, which have Democratic governors and Republican-led legislatures and have in recent years been unable to enact significant laws either protecting or restricting abortion.

BA.2.75 is making its way across India and about 10 other countries, including the U.S., where a third case was detected last week. Meanwhile, a new strain of BA.5 has materialized, but its effect is still unclear. [ AP: New Coronavirus Mutant Raises Concerns In India And Beyond ](https://apnews.com/article/covid-science-health-india-united-states-e461b0c0db39707aab884378c24292ae) The quickly changing coronavirus has spawned yet another super contagious omicron mutant that's worrying scientists as it gains ground in India and pops up in numerous other countries, including the United States. Scientists say the variant - called BA.2.75 - may be able to spread rapidly and get around immunity from vaccines and previous infection. It's unclear whether it could cause more serious disease than other omicron variants, including the globally prominent BA.5.

The city recorded 69 new infections for Sunday, the most since late May and up from 57 the day before. Cases have increased abruptly after a period of little to no trace of the virus, where officials declared victory over Covid and praised their handling of a crisis that left China's most global city locked down for two months in May and June.

These days, due a number of factors, the reverse is true: It's considerably less lethal, but more exponentially transmissible.

The latest omicron offshoot, BA.5, has quickly become dominant in the United States, and thanks to its elusiveness when encountering the human immune system, is driving a wave of cases across the country.

Yet treatments for the post-viral illness known as long Covid, which is afflicting millions, are nowhere close to being developed.
