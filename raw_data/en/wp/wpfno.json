Recent newspaper articles report: Pilgrims stream to the house of an unconscious girlnamed Audrey Santo, said to be \"a mystic and a victimsoul who takes on the suffering of people who ask her tointercede with God\" ( New York Times ,30August 1998). \"Jews Discover the Allure of Healing through Faith\" (Jewish Advocate ,9-15 March 2001 ). A \"run on votive candles back in New England yesterday when word filtered north [from Red Sox spring trainingin Florida] that Nomar Garciaparra's right wrist was beingplaced soft cast\" ( Boston Globe ,1March 2001 ). The papers in this volume represent a first effort at compiling information on the extent and diversi-ty of religious healing in the Boston area. Themajority of the papers were written by Harvard stu-dents, based on the ethnographic fieldwork thatthey conducted during the academic year2000-2001 . For the most part, students were encour- aged to explore communities or phenomena inwhich they expressed particular interest. We havealso included papers by the senior scholars (LindaBarnes and Susan Sered) who worked with the stu-dents. We plan to publish a second edition of thisvolume, to include papers written by students asso-ciated with Boston University's Healing LandscapeProject. These additional papers will fill out thematerial in the present volume through a focus onAfrican descent communities in the neighborhoodsserved by the Boston Medical Center. Religion and Healing The interface of religion and healing takes manyforms in twenty-first-century America: there is nosingle \"mainstream\" or \"normative\" set of religioushealing practices and beliefs that has spreadthroughout cities such as Boston. The healing prac-tices and beliefs described in this volume are rootedin particular religious traditions, many of whichoriginated outside of the United States or during historical periods very different from our contem-porary setting. These traditions represent a widevariety of ritual approaches and diverse understand-ings of what it means to heal or be healed. In selecting communities and events to explore in the context of this project, we were sensitive to theabsence of a consensus in American society regard-ing the meaning, or even the parameters, of both\"religion\" and \"healing.\" Opting for the sometimeschaotic richness of casting our net too wide ratherthan for the ethnocentric dangers of adopting arigid definition of religious healing, we included inour study events, beliefs, and situations described bymembers of particular religious communities as\"Jewish/ Christian/ Muslim/ Buddhist healing\" andprayers, practices, and rituals that, to us, \"lookedlike\" a religiously informed healing event. For contemporary Americans, religion can encompass phenomena and experiences rangingfrom a personal sense of spirituality, faith in aDivine Being, or adherence to a set of ethical tenets,to identification with a community within whichone celebrates holidays or life-cycle events. Factorsthat complicate current American understandingsof religion include: recent large-scale arrivals in theUnited States of immigrant groups from non-European and non-Christian countries; the swiftand concurrent rise of New Age spirituality and ofvarious forms of religious fundamentalism;America's ongoing enchantment with scientificadvances, such as cloning and the search for extra-terrestrial life; and enduring disputes regardingboundaries between church and state. Healing is an equally complex and contested word in the United States today. Healing can mean thedirect, unequivocal, and scientifically measurablecure of physical illnesses; healing can mean copingwith, or coming to terms with, or learning to livewith that which one cannot change (including phys-ical illness and emotional trauma); it can refer todeveloping a sense of wholeness\u2014emotional, social, Introduction Susan Sered2/ Religious H ealing in B oston spiritual, or physical; and it can sig nify the p rocess ofrepairing o ne's relationship w ith Go d.For some, the o nly valid heale rs are physicians w ith d egrees from accredited me dical sc hools;for othe othe rs,healing is f ound c tive me the lf.
