Learn about our Medical Review Board Print Are there herbs for memory that can improve brain health and prevent memory loss? A number of herbs and spices may help improve your brain health, and some of them may be already sitting in your fridge or pantry. Several of these herbs and spices have been studied for their effects on Alzheimer's disease, while others have been tested for their overall effects on cognition (i.e. the mental action or process involved in thinking, understanding, learning, and remembering). Here's a look at some of the herbs and spices found to benefit the brain in scientific studies. Feel Good Foods: The Diet-Brain Connection 1 Sage Schon & Probst / Picture Press / Getty Images Sage is an herb for memory that has a number of brain benefits. A spice known for its pungent scent, sage might also improve cognition and aid in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, a research review published in 2017, suggests sage contains compounds that may be beneficial for cognitive and neurological function. Try adding sage to butternut squash, roasted chicken, turkey, tomato sauce, or in a white bean soup. Sage can also be consumed in tea form. 2 Turmeric Westend61 / Getty Images Turmeric is a spice long used in Ayurveda. It contains a compound called curcumin, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (two factors that may benefit brain health and overall health). According to a review published in 2010, preliminary research suggests that turmeric may boost brain health and stave off Alzheimer's disease by clearing the brain of beta-amyloid (a protein fragment). The buildup of beta-amyloid is known to form Alzheimer's-related brain plaques. In addition, turmeric may shield brain health by inhibiting the breakdown of nerve cells in the brain. Turmeric is a key ingredient in curry powder, which typically also includes such spices as coriander and cumin. To increase your intake of turmeric, try adding curry powder or turmeric to stir-fries, soups, and vegetable dishes. Include a couple of dashes of black pepper to enhance the absorption of turmeric. 3 Ginkgo Biloba Achim Sass / Getty Images Long used as a treatment for dementia, ginkgo biloba is a commonly taken remedy in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and well known for its benefits. It's thought that ginkgo biloba might help improve cognitive function in part by stimulating circulation and promoting blood flow to the brain. Although research on ginkgo biloba has yielded mixed results, there's some evidence that this herb may enhance cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment. Furthermore, a research review published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease in 2015 suggests that a ginkgo biloba extract called EGb761 may be especially helpful in slowing decline in cognition among patients experiencing neuropsychiatric symptoms in addition to cognitive impairment and dementia. A core feature of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms include depression and other non-cognitive disturbances. Ginkgo Biloba Benefits, Uses, Side Effects 4 Ashwagandha Vaithinathan Muthuramann / StockFood Creative / Getty Images Another Ayurvedic herb, ashwagandha has been found to inhibit the formation of beta-amyloid plaques in preliminary research, according to a review study published in 2010. What's more, the review says preliminary studies have indicated that ashwagandha may benefit the brain by reducing oxidative stress (a factor that may contribute to the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease). 5 Ginseng AbbieImages / Getty Images Ginseng is one of the best herbs for memory due to its potential ability to prevent memory loss and reduce age-related memory declines. One of the most popular plants in herbal medicine, ginseng contains anti-inflammatory chemicals called ginsenosides. According to a review published in 2018, scientists have observed that ginsenosides may help reduce brain levels of beta-amyloid in preliminary lab studies. 6 Gotu Kola Ottmar Diez / Photodisc / Getty Images In alternative medicine systems such as Ayurveda and TCM, Gotu kola has long been used to improve mental clarity. Findings from animal-based research suggest that this herb may also help the brain by fighting oxidative stress. In a preliminary study published in Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology & Physiology in 2003, for instance, tests on rats demonstrated that gotu kola may inhibit Alzheimer's-associated oxidative stress and improve cognitive function. 7 Lemon Balm Ottmar Diez / StockFood Creative / Getty Images An herb often taken in tea form and frequently used to ease anxiety and insomnia, lemon balm may help improve cognitive function. Some research suggests that this may be a great herb for memory loss. For a study published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry in 2003, 42 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease took either a placebo or lemon balm extract for four months. At the end of the study, those given lemon balm showed a significantly greater improvement in cognitive function (compared to those given the placebo). Should You Use Herbs for Memory and Brain Health? While certain herbs and spices may have beneficial effects on your brain, no natural remedy should be used as a substitute for standard care in the treatment of a condition affecting brain health. It is important to note that while adding herbs and spices in the small amounts used in cooking can be healthy and beneficial, using them in larger amounts should not be considered better. Taking herbs and spices in a more concentrated form, as found in supplements, carries more risk of adverse side effects. Seizures have been reported in children taking sage supplements; cheilitis in adults. Concentrated (supplement) forms of turmeric, ginseng, and ginkgo have a blood-thinning effect thereby increasing the risk of bleeding, especially in people taking other blood thinners or anticoagulants. Ginseng can cause changes in blood pressure (higher or lower), interacts with many medications, and can cause a severe allergic reaction or liver damage in rare cases. Gotu Kola has been linked to damage to the liver in rare instances. There is no FDA regulation of the content and purity of supplements. One study found that over 20% of Ayuvedic supplements were contaminated by heavy metals like lead, mercury, or arsenic. A Word From Verywell Herbs for memory should be used as an adjunct to other health practices. If you take herbs for memory loss in the form of supplements, you should always talk to your doctor first. Frequently Asked Questions What can I take naturally to improve my memory? In addition to herbs for memory, there are also supplements that may have memory-boosting benefits. B vitamins, l-theanine, and omega-3 fatty acids are a few examples. Healthy lifestyle changes such as getting regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, and maintaining an active social life are other changes that can have a positive impact on brain health and memory as you age. What herb is good for memory loss? Herbs that may help with memory loss include ginseng, ginkgo biloba, ashwagandha, tumeric, and sage. What herb stimulates Ginkgo biloba is one of the most well-researched herbs for memory that can potentially stimulate cognitive function and prevent memory loss. 10 Sources Verywell Mind uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
