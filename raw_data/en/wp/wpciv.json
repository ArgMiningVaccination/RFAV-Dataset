Our acupuncturist will then insert typically between 5 and 20 small acupuncture needles into specific points on the head, arms, hands, legs, feet, or back. The needles are very thin and our acupuncturists are skilled in their technique, so this is a generally painless process. The needles will stay in for typically 15-30 minutes, depending on the treatment goals. Research has shown that acupuncture increases endorphins in the brain and most patients report feeling very relaxed during the duration of the session; many people even fall asleep! The practitioner will then carefully remove and dispose of the needles at the end of the session. Many patients describe feelings of tranquility and subtle improvements in their energy and mood immediately following their sessions. Patients frequently report symptom improvement in the days and weeks following each acupuncture treatment. "}
