T he vaccine is currently free to pharmacies ; therefore , we will only be reimbursing for administration. For the administration fee, Montana Healthcare Programs will follow the Medicare estab lished rates. Some of the billing requirements are similar to those for other vaccines, but there are distinct differences in some of the fields required for submission. Please read all instructions carefully. Failure to enter all fields appropriately w ill result in a denied claim. The following NCPDP fields are required for Montana Healthcare Programs to properly reimburse for the vaccine and the administration fee: 42\u00d8- DK (Submission Clarification Code (SCC) ) - For two-dose vaccines, submit a 02 for the first vaccine and a 06 for the second vaccine. Do not enter a SCC for single dose vaccines. 439-E4 (Reason for Service Code) - Submit AD (Additional Drug Needed). 438-E3 (Incentive Amount Submitted) - For submitting your usual and customary vaccine administration fee. The reimbursement rates above will be applied regardless of amount entered. 44\u00d8- E5 (DUR Professional Service Code) - Submit MA (Medication Administration). Submit the correct vaccine unit, which is often less than 1.0 mL. Bill each vaccine dose for a 1 -day supply. Reasons claims may deny include: Missing any of the required fields above. SCC does not match dose given. First vaccine doesn't match second vaccine (i.e. , Moderna given as first dose, Pfizer given as second dose). Billing wrong units (i.e. , Moderna 0.5 mL; Pfizer 0.3 mL). Billing wrong days-supply. Billing second dose before it is due (i.e. , 21 days for Pfizer ; 28 days for Moderna). For pharmacies who have already begun administering COVID -19 vaccines, claims may be back billed to the date the vaccine was administered.
