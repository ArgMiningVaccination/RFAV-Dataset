Immunization is less protective against milder Omicron infection, and protection against infection may be briefer for children 5- to-11. More data on vaccine effectiveness in pediatric populations is expected to follow over the coming weeks to months. There are no changes to recommendations or operations, currently. 34Booster Vaccines are Safe Among Persons Aged 12- to-17 years 35MMWR (3/1/22): Safety Monitoring of COVID -19 Vaccine Booster Doses Among Persons Aged 12- 17 Years -United States, December 9, 2021 -February and VaccinesUpdated review of national COVID -19 vaccine safety data Reactions after booster vaccination were mild to moderate and transient The frequency of reported local and systemic reactions were similar after the booster dose and second dose.
