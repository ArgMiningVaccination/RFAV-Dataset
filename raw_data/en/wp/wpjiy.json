CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 1 Table of Contents Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? ................................ ................................ ..................... 3 The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavi rus disease 19 (COVID -19). Identifying the infectious dose for humans by any exposure route is critical to diagnostics, decontamination, and model development . Animal studies are a plausible surrogate. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? ................................ ...................... 4 SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily betw een humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Undetected cases play a major role in transmission. Identifying the contribution of asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic transmission is important for implementing control measures. Additionally, the relative contribution of different infection sources - fomites, droplets, aerosols, and potentially feces - are unknown. Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ................................ ......................... 5 SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mamma l host before infecting humans . The identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. To date, ferrets, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. Cats can transmit infection to other cats. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Several animal models have been developed to recreate human -like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures . Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? .......................... 6 The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. While the incubation period is well -characterized, less is known about how long individuals are infectious before, during, and after symptoms. Additionally, the possibility of reinfection warrants more research. Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? ................................ ................................ ... 7 Most COVID -19 cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group. Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. Current modeling suggests the overall case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID -19 is approximately 2.4%,17 but varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. Evidence suggests that African Americans are at elevated risk of severe symptoms . Additional data on vulnerable subpopulations is needed. Children of all ages are susceptible to COVID -19,84 though generally show milder55, 145 or no symptoms . The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities and case definitions vary by location. Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ................................ ........ 8 Infected patients show productive immune responses, however , more data is needed. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinf ected with SARS -CoV-2. Understanding the duration of protective immunity is limited by small sample sizes . Animal models are plausible surrogates. Additional research to quantify the risk of reinfection after weeks, months, and years is needed. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? .................... 9 Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests ar e relatively accurate. Confirmed cases are still underreported. Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 2 In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though robust estimates of false positive/ negative rates are still lacking. The efficacy of serological testing should be confirmed. Pharmaceutical Interventions - Are there effective treatments? Vaccines? ................................ ................................ ............ 10 Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.100, 151 Over 3324 clinical trials are ongoing, bu t results are prelimina ry.65,28 Convalescent sera is being tested at multiple sites across the US.152 Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and animal trials. No preliminary results are available. In gene ral, the efficacy of various therapeutic options for COVID -19 is unknown, though clinical trial results are beginning to be released. Non -pharmaceutical Interventions - Are public health control measures effective at reducin g spread? ................................ .11 Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. The effect of relaxing control measures is unknown, and research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. As US states have implemented differing cont rol measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? ................................ ................................ ......... 12 SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditi ons. If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. Additional testing on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogate viruses, is needed to support initial estimates of stability. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? ................................ .......................... 13 Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Methods for decontaminating N95 mask s have been approved by the FDA under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Additional decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply, are needed. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? ................................ ................................ ................................ ....... 14 The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Most PPE recommendations have not been m ade on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare worker is critical due to the ir high rates of infection. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ................................ ................................ ................ 15 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of S ARS-CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. Geno mics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? ................................ ................................ .................. 16 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitution s and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity, though modeling work is attempting to identify possible changes. Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression in patients) is needed. CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 3 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19). Work using SARS -CoV-2 A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV-2 infected cynomolgus macaques via combination intratracheal exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).185 Macaques did not exhibit clinical symptoms , but virus was shed from the nose and throat.185 Rhesus macaques are effectively infected with SARS -CoV-2 via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a of approximately 700,000 PFU (106 TCID 50).81,82 Rhesus macaques infected with -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate disease observed in the majority of human cases.157 Ferrets infected with 316,000 TCID 50 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disease. Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferr ets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contact . Direct contact is required to transfer infection between ferrets.118 Syrian Golden Hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU via the intranasal route closely resemble human respiratory infection. Uninfected hamsters in close contact with infected hamsters show symptoms within 4 days of exposure.51 Domestic cats exposed to 100 ,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route developed severe pathological symptoms including lesions in the nose, throat, and lungs.197 Juvenile cats exhibited more severe symptoms than subadults .197 Relat ed Coronaviruses The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS) in mice is estimated to be between 67 -540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).78, 80 Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to doses of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) virus between 100 and 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.13, 66, 131, 246 What do we need to know? Identifying the infectious dose for humans by any exposure route is critical to diagnostics, decontamination, and model development . Animal studies are a plausible surrogate.

How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Pandemic COVID -19 has caused 1,945,055 infections and 121,897 deaths112 in at least 185 countries and territories (as of 4/14/2020).42, 192, 226 In the US there are 584,073 confirmed SARS -CoV-2 cases across all 50 US states, with 23,709 deaths (as of 4/ 14/2020) .112 Sustained community transmission of COVID -19 is occurring in the US.26 High -quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1 .148, 169, 182, 233, 245 SARS -CoV-2 is believed to spread through close contact and droplet transmission,46 with fomite transmission likely113 99 but unconfirme d.225 Aerosolized virus has been detected in COVID -19 patient rooms, with particle sizes within the human respirable range (0. 25 - 2.5 m).141 Extensive contamination of patient rooms indicates the potential for airborne transmission, though to date infectious virus has not been isolated from ae rosol samples.189 Limited evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation in the absence of cough, howe ver more work is needed.7, 189 11, 130 SARS -CoV-2 is present in infected patient saliva,207 lower respiratory sputum,215 and feces.135 Up to 67% of patients with asymptomatic infection may still show CT evidence of pneumonia .216 Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. SARS -CoV-2 replicates in the upper respiratory tract (e.g., throat), and infectious virus is detectable in throat and lung tissue for at least 8 days .228 Pre-symptomatic248 or asymptomatic21 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2; between 12%85 and 23%140 of infections may be caused by asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic transmission. Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days pri or to symptom onset.219 Severe cases are more likely to transmit disease , and most new infections are within households of infected patients.146 Undetected cases play a major role in transmission. Models suggest up to 86% of early COVID-19 cases in China were undetected, and these infections were the source for 79% of reported cases.133 Models estimate that the true number of cases may be approximately 11 times greater than the reported number of cases in the UK,241 and between 5 and 10 times greater than the reported number of cases in the US.114 What do we need to know? Identifying the contribution of asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic transmission is important for implementing control measures. Additionally, the relative contribution of different infection sources - fomites, droplets, aerosols, and potentially feces - are unknown. Capability of SARS -CoV-2 to be transmitted by contact with fomites (phones, doorknobs, surfaces, clothing, etc.) - see also Experimental Stability Superspreading capacity needs to be refined . Updated person to person transmission rates (e.g., R 0) as control measures take effect. What is the underreporting rate?110 Can individuals become re -infected with SARS -CoV-2? What is the difference in transmissibility among count ries? Is the R 0 estimate higher in healthcare or long -term care facilities? How effective are social distancing measures? When will infections peak in various cities and countries? CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 5 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Host Range - How many species does it infect ? Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans . The identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,251 with a suggested bat origin.5,67, 251 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,48 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.27, 69, 236, 243 Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 genomes suggests that a non -bat intermediate species is responsible for the beginning of the outbreak.184 The identity of the intermediate host remains unknown.134, 137 -138 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples collected several years ago.123 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor -binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS -CoV-1,231 potentially explaining its high transmissibility . The same work suggests that differences between SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV-1 Spike proteins may limit the therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatments.231 Modeling of SARS -CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 proteins suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can bind and infect human, bat, civet, monkey and swine cells.213 Receptor binding is not the only feature of coronaviruses that facilitate cell entry, however , changes in proteolytic cleavage of Spike protein can also affect animal host range.153 To date, ferrets, hamsters, cats, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. Cats can transmit infection to other cats. It is unknown whether these animals can transmit infection to humans. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamster s, primates and ferrets may be susceptible to infection.51, 118 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100,000 PFU via the intranasal route), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.197 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 showed limited evidence of infection, producing anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies but no clinical symptoms.197 Wild cats (tigers)218 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.150, 244 Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS -CoV-2 (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens, 100,000 PFU for pigs, all via intranasal route).197 There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 infects livestock.109 What do we need to know? Several animal models have been developed to recreate human -like illness, though to date they have been infected with high dose exposures . Lower dose studies may better replicate human disease acquisition . What is the intermediate host(s)? What are the mutations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human infection and transmission? What other animals can SARS -CoV-2 infect (e.g., pet dogs, potential wildlife reservoirs)? Can infected animals transmit to humans (e.g., pet cats, pet dogs to humans)? CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 6 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Incubation period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? The majority of individuals develop symptoms within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. The best current estimate of the COVID -19 incubation period is 5.1 days, wi th 99% of individuals exhibiting symptoms within 14 days of exposure.126 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.126 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.21, 50, 100, 203, 248 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic ,46, 186, 203, 248 and asymptomati c individuals can have similar amounts of virus in their nose and throat as symptomatic individuals .253 Infectious period is unknown, but possibly up to 10 -14 days .10, 133, 192 On average, there are approximately 485 to 7.5132 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain. Most hospitalized individuals are admitted within 8 -14 days of symptom onset.250 What do we need to know? While the incubation period is well -characterized, less is known about how long individuals are infectious before, during, and after symptoms. Additionally, the possibility of reinfection warrants more research. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the disease? Are individuals infectious after hospital discharge and clinical recovery, or are positive PCR tests only detecting non -infectious virus? Can individuals become re -infected after recovery? If so, how long after? CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 7 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID-19) Clinical presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? What do we know? Most COVID -19 cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group. Older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. The majority of COVID -19 cases are mild (81%, N = 44,000 cases) .203 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% overall, but only 44% - 52% present with fever initially18, 100 ), cough (6 7.7%100), fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, and reduced lymphocy te count.47, 54, 107 Headache53 is uncommon. Diarrhea ma y be uncommon,107, 132 though lack of appetite may be an early symptom.167 Complications include acute respirato ry distress (ARDS ), 17-29% of hospitalized patients,58, 107 leading to death in 4 -15% of cases58, 107, 214 ), pneumonia,166 cardiac injury (20%198), secondary infection, kidney failure, arrhythmia, sepsis, and shock.100, 107, 214, 250 Most deaths are caused by respiratory failure or respiratory failure combined with myocardial (heart) damag e.187 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe,100, 203 and approximately 5% of patients are admitted to the ICU.100, 203 Loss of taste and smell appears in 5 -30% of patients who test positiv e, however ~18% of individuals who test negative also report this symptom. More work is needed.20,96,63 Several studies suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is not transmitted from mother to child during birth,57, 59, 191, 240 however larger studie s are needed. Ocular symptoms such as conjunctivitis have been seen in severe COVID -19 cases.235 Current modeling suggests the overall case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID -19 is approximately 2.4% ,17 but varies substantially by patient age and underlying comorbidities. The CFR depends on comorbidities . Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.203, 250 The CFR increases with age : individuals >60 are at higher risk of death,203, 250 and >60% of confirmed fatalities have been male.203 In the US, 34% of hospitalizations have been individuals younger than 44 years old.8 Variation in the CFR between countries may be due to demographics, testing criteria, and how COVID -19 related deaths are defined.162 Evidence suggests that African Americans are at elevat ed risk of severe symptoms . Additional data on vulnerable subpopulations is needed . A review of US COVID -19 patients revealed that African Americans are disproportionately represented in hospitalized populations (comprising 33% of hospitalized patients compared to only 18% of the base study population).95 Additional research highlighting potentially vulnerable subpopulations is needed. Children of all ages are susceptible to COVID -19,84 though generally show milder55, 145 or no symptoms . Up to 28% of children may be asymptomatic.172 Severe symptoms in children are possible,139 and infant deaths have been recorded.35, 145 What do we need to know? The true case fatality rate is unknown, as the exact number of cases is uncertain. Testing priorities and case definitions vary by location . How long does it take for infected individuals to recover outside of a healthcare setting? Are reductions in CFR over time (e.g., China) an indication of better treatment, less overcrowding, or both? Are pregnant women at greater risk of complications during labor?136 How prevalent is loss of smell, loss of taste and gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID -19 patients? CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 8 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, however more data is needed. In a limited study (n=9), hospitalized patients shed high levels of infectious virus for 7 -days via the nasal - pharyngeal route , 50% of patients seroconverted within 7 days, and all patients by 14 days. Seroconversion did not correlate with lower viral load .228 In a larger study (n=175), most patients developed neutralizing antibodies within 10 -15 days after disease onset. Elderly patients had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than younger patients.232 Based on one patient, a productive immune response is generated and sustained for at least 7 days.204 Previous studies on coronavirus i mmunity suggest that neutralizing antibody may wane after several years . 36, 234 More data are needed. A small subset of COVID -19 patients in China (8%) did not develo p a serological response to infection , and the potential for reinfection in these patients is unknown.232 Interestingly, the majority of patients that failed to develop a quantifiable immune response were < 40 years old. Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Experimentally infected macaques were not capable of being reinfected after their primary infection r esolved.23 According to the WHO, there is no evidence of re -infection with SARS -CoV-2 after recovery.125 Patients can test positive via PCR for up to 37 days after symptoms appear ,250 and after recovery and hospital discharge.124 The ability of these individuals to infect others is unknown. What do we need to know? Understanding the duration of protective immunity is limited by small sample sizes . Animal models are plausible surrogates. Additional research to quantify the risk of reinfection after weeks, months, and years is needed. How long does the immune response last? Is there evidence of waning immunity? Can humans become reinfected? Are patients who test positive weeks after discha rge from hospital capable of transmitting infection? How does the patient immune response vary by age?

When during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis relies on identifying the genetic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests are relatively accurate. Confirmed cases are still underreported. US CDC has expanded patient testing criteria to in clude symptomatic patients at clinician discretion.25 PCR protocols and primers have been widely shared inter nationally.41, 71, 132, 196, 222, 227 PCR-based diagnostic assays are unable to differentiate betw een active and inactive virus. Broad testing in Iceland suggests that ~50% of those who test positive are symptom -free at the time of testing .19 155 A combination of pharyngeal (throat) RT -PCR and chest tomography are the most effective diagnostic criteria (correctly diagnose 91.9% of infections).179 A single throat swab detects 78.2% of infections , and duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.179 Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective as diagnostic specimens than sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ,215 although recent evidenc e suggests this may not always be the case.228 More work is needed. RT-PCR tests can identify asymptomatic cases . The SARS -CoV-2 infection was identified in 2/114 individuals cleared by clinical assessment.106 Combination RT -PCR and serology (antibody) testing may increase the ability to diag nose patients with mild symptoms, or identify patients at higher risk of severe disease.247 The FDA released an Emergency Use Authorization enabling laboratories to develop and use tests in-house for patient diagnosis.93 Updated tests from the US CDC are available to states.41, 46 Multiple rapid or real -time test kits have been produced by universities and industry, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology,74 BGI,29 Cepheid212, Abbot,91 and Mesa Biotech.30 The US CDC is developing serological tests to determine what proportion of the population has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2.116 A rapid antibody test by Cellex is now authorized by the FDA .105, 221 Home tests are being developed ; however none are FDA approved, nor are they useable as a diagnostic .158-159, 168 Machine learning tools are being developed to predict severe and fatal COVID -19 cases based on CT scans.199 Interleukin -6 levels of >80 pg/mL were associated with respiratory failure in a small study (n=41).102 More work is needed . Validated serological (antibody) assays are being developed to help det ermine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Researchers have tested a variety of enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to determine their sensitivity and specificity to SARS -CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses . Results show high specificity, though sa mple sizes for SARS -CoV-2 patients were small.161 In one German town, serological testing has been used to identify the percent of the population already exposed to SARS -CoV-2 (14%), which can assist in public health response planning.177 What do we need to know? In general, PCR tests appear to be sensitive and specific, though robust estimates of false positive/negative rates are still lacking. The efficacy of serological testing should be confirmed. False positive/negative rates for tests Eclipse phase of infecti on (time between infection and detectable disease) in an individual With limited testing in many locations, how accurate are clinical diagnoses compared to genetic tests? How effective are different swab specimens as diagnostic samples? How many serologica l tests need to be done to obtain an accurate picture of underlying exposure?

Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.100, 151 Over 3324 clinical trials are ongoing, but results are prelim inary .65,28 Convalescent sera is being tested at multiple sites across the US.152 WHO is tracking >50 potential vaccines ,68 and has begun two global clinical trials: Solidarity and Discovery 121that include remdesivir, and ritonavir/lopinavir and int erferon -beta.121 Limited, preliminary evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy of favipiravir,56 tocilizumab,237 intravenous immunoglobulin,38 and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin.97, 142 Additional work including sufficiently powere d clinical trials are necessary to confirm therapeutic efficacy of any of these compounds. Limited, preliminary evidence shows mixed efficacy of chloroquine alone,3 and no efficacy from combinat ion ritonavir and lopinavir.37 Additional work is necessary to confirm these results. Favipiravir has been approved to treat COVID -19 in China.1 Antibody based therapeutics are planned to start clinical trials in 3 -5 months.64, 89, 202 Teams across the USA are testing passive antibody therapy (convalescent serum39) to patients (FDA Investigational New Drug approval).92 In a small trial (5 patients) ,195 convalescent sera administration was followed by clinical improvement.195 Corticosteroids are commonly given to COVID -19 patients250 at risk of ARDS,238 but their use is not recommended by the US CDC.43 Laboratory testing identified 17 repurposed drugs and remdesivir -like nucleoside inhibitors194 with significant antiviral activity, however more research is needed to confirm efficacy.220 Additional clinical trials involving anti -inflammatory drugs are recruiting patients (interleukin -6 inhibitors, sarilumab2 and tocilizumab9). A blood -cleaning device has been approved by the FDA under Emergency Use Authorization to filter cytokines from severely ill COVID -19 patient s.154 For patients with ARDS, prone positioning (placing patients on their stomachs and sides rather than their backs ) may aid oxygenation and reduce mortality.22, 101 Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and animal trials. No preliminary results are available. Multiple entities are working to produce a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine,14 including HHS/NIH/NIAID,103, and Johnson and Johnson.115 Moderna has begun phase 1 clinical vaccine trials.183 What do we need to know? In general, the efficacy of various therapeutic options for COVID -19 is unknown, though clinical trial results are beginning to be released. Is GS -5734 (remdesivir) effective in vivo (already used in clinical trials under Emergency Use Authorization)?193 Is the GLS -5000 MERS vaccine242 cross -reactive against SARS -CoV-2? Efficacy of antibody treatments developed for SARS72, 201 and MERS49 What is the efficacy of various MERS and SARS Phase I/II vaccines and other therapeutics? Are viral replicase inhibitors such as b eta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine effective against SARS -CoV-2?24 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 11 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Non -pharmaceutical Interventions - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? What do we know? Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing movement, and modeling shows evidence that they reduce transmission. Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong73 and reduced spread in China.119, 143 Modeling demonstrates that multifaceted restrictions and quarantines in China reduced the R 0 of SARS -CoV-2 from greater than 3 to less than 1 between Januar y 23rd and February 5th.165 Models indicate that a combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are required to effectively limit transmission.94 Preliminary modeling results from Japan suggest that school closure s alone were not sufficient to limit COVID -19 spread, though the school closures in question only applied to students between 6 and 18 years of age.111 Globally, there is some evidence that implementing social distancing measures has reduced the amount individuals travel, though the data are bas ed on planned rather than actual trips.149 Restrictive lockdowns in China are estimated to have reduced disease transmission within only a few days.252 Non-pharmaceutical interventions in China did not reduce transmission equally across all groups; transmission rates in younger individuals, particularl y infants, as well as hospital workers continued to increase even while overall transmission rates declined.165 The effect of relaxing control measures is unknown , and research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. Modeling suggests that premature lifting of social distancing measures will substantially increase the number of local COVID -19 cases in Wuhan, China.170 Similarly, forecasts in the US estimate a resumption of exponential case growth if social distancing measures are r elaxed.75 In the UK, modelers are assessing the efficacy of rolling interventions, whereby social distancing measures are put into place every few weeks to keep healthcare demand below a critical point.241 A modeling study using Chinese data estimate d the impact of relaxing social distancing measures after an initial reduction in disease transmission. Results suggest that if R 0 is allowed to rise above 1, tightening controls may not be enough to keep transmission low; rather, additional effort would be needed to drive R 0 below 1 again, suggesting that carefully balancing control measures to maintain R 0 below 1 would be more efficient than allowing R 0 to increase again in the first place.127 Robust contact tracing and case finding may be needed to control COVID -19 in the US, but would require additional staff and resources to conduct effectively.217 What do we need to know? As different US states have implemented differing control measures at various times, a comprehensive analysis of social distancing efficacy has not yet been conducted. How many cases in the US have been averted due to social distancing restrictions? How long does it take for various non-pharmaceutical interventions to show effects? What are effective surrogate measures of social distancing efficacy (e.g., reduction in travel, contact, traffic, etc .)? What are plausible options for relaxing social distancing and other intervention meas ures without resulting in a resurgence of COVID -19 cases? CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 12 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. If aerosolized intentionally, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. SARS -CoV-2 Data SARS -CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces for between 3 days (21 -23\u00b0C, 40% RH)210 and 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65%RH). Infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask af ter 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH). 61 SARS -CoV-2 has an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23oC and 65% RH).210 SARS -CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70oC), but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4oC).61, 176 SARS -CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days after cabins were vacated . The infectiousness of this material is not known.156 Surrogate Coronavirus data : Studies suggest that other coronaviruses can survive on non -porous surfaces up to 9 -10 days (MHV, SARS -CoV) ,40, 52 and porous surfaces for up to 3 -5 days (SARS -CoV)87 in air conditioned env ironments (20-25oC, 40 -50% RH). Coronavirus survival tends to be higher at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity (RH),40, 52, 174, 211 though infectious virus can persist on surfaces for several days in typical office or hospital conditions .211 SARS can persist with trace infectivity for up to 28 days at refrigerated temperatures (4oC) on surfaces.40 No strong evid ence exists showing reduction in transmission with seasonal increase in temperature and humidity.147 One hour after aerosolization approxi mately 63% of airborne MERS virus remained viable in a simulated office environment (25oC, 75% RH) .171 Porous hospital materials, including paper and cotton cloth, maintain infectious SARS -CoV for a shorter time than non -porous material.122 What do we need to know? Additional testing on SARS -CoV-2, as opposed to surrogate viruses, is needed to support initial estimates of stability. Stability of SARS -CoV-2 in aerosol, droplets, and other matrices (mucus/sputum, feces) Particle size distribution (e.g., droplet, large droplet and true aerosol distribution) Duration of SARS -CoV-2 infectivity via fomites and surface (contact hazard) Stability of SARS -CoV-2 on PPE (e.g., Tyvek, nitrile, etc.) CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 13 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Decontamination - What are effecti ve methods to kill the agent in the environment? What do we know? Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. SARS -CoV-2 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.120 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective against live virus in lab tests.60 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.163 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but solutions were not tested on live virus.12 Other Coronaviruses Chlorine -based224 and ethanol -based70 solutions are recommended. Heat treatment (56oC) is sufficient to kill coronaviruses,174, 249 though effectiveness depends partly on protein in the sample.174 70% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite (0.02% radiation and CCV).188 Ethanol -based biocides effectively disinfect coronaviruses dried on surfaces, including ethanol containing gels similar to hand sanitizer.108, 229 Surface spray disinfectants such as Mikrobac, Dismozon, and Korsolex are effective at reducing infectivity of the closely related SARS -CoV after 30 minutes of contact.173 Coronaviruses may b e resistant to thermal inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.205, 206 Coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.86 Methods for decontaminating N95 masks have been approved by the FDA under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Hydrogen peroxide vapor can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.181 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.90 The FDA has issued a n Emergency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating 10 N95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals.32 What do we need to know? Additional decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply, are needed. What is the minimal contact time for disinfectants? Does contamination with human fluids/waste alter disinfectant efficacy profiles? How effective is air filtration at reducing transmission in healthcare, airplanes and public spaces? Are landfills and wastewater treatment plants effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2? Is heat or UV decontamination effective to clean N95 respirators and other types of PPE for multi - use? CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 14 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) PPE - What PPE is effective, and who shou ld be using it? What do we know? The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses (over 1,000203) demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, a nd infection control.190 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers appears high, with up to 20% of healthcare workers in Lombardy, Italy becoming infected.178 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield) .\"44 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve as well as gloves.223 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those dealing with possible aerosols .224 Additional protection, such as a Powered Air Pu rifying Respirator (PAPR) with a full hood, should be considered for high -risk procedures (i.e., intubation, ventilation) .34 Particular attention should be paid to the potential for transmission via exhaled air during supportive respiratory procedures.99 There is evidence both for141 and against163 the detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA via air sampling in patient rooms and other hospital areas . Research at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has provided initial estimates of PPE needs in the US: 7.8 billion gloves, 668 million gowns, 360 million surgical masks, and 136 million N95 or similar respirators.208 Masks may be effective at slowing transmission . Surgical face masks, respirators and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals (with or without symptoms) to other individuals .128, 209, 77 More work is needed. On 4/3/2020, t he US CDC recommend ed wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain .45 The efficacy of homemade PPE, made with T -shirt s, bandanas, or similar materials, is less than standard PPE, but may offer some protection if no other options are available.62, 76, 180 What do we need to know? Most PPE recommendations have not been made on SARS -CoV-2 data, and comparative efficacy of different PPE for different tasks (e.g., intubation) is unknown. Identification of efficacious PPE for healthcare worker s is critical due to their high rates of infection. What is the importance of aerosol transmission? What is the effective distance of spread via droplet or aerosol? How effective are barriers such as N95 respirators or surgical masks? What is the appropriate PPE for first responders? Airport screeners? What are proper procedures for reducing spread and transmission rates in medical facilities? How effective are homemade masks at reducing transmission? CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 15 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Genomic analysis places SARS -CoV-2 into the beta -coronavirus clade, with close relationship to bat coronaviruses. The SARS -CoV-2 virus is distinct from SARS -CoV-1 and MERS viruses.83 Genomic analysis sugg ests that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human -derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.15, 251 Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non - human animal host prior to zoonoti c transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"15 Both scenario s are consistent with the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Some SARS -CoV-2 gen omic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses ,230 and data suggests that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses .137, 138 Additional research is needed. Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,15 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"15 Work with other coronaviruses have indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition motif.79 What do we need to know? Identifying the intermediate species between bats and humans would aid in reducing potential spillover from a natural source. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate species? Are there closely related circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS -CoV-2? CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 16 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates substitutions and mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mutations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity , though modeling work is attempting to identify possible changes . There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to De cember 2019 . Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.16, 27, 175 The mutation rate of SARS -CoV-2 is estimated to be similar to other RNA viruses (e.g., SARS, Ebola, Zika), and is currently calculated to be 1.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year (N = 116 genomes).104 Pangolin coronaviruses are closely related to both SARS -CoV-2 and closely related bat coronaviruses . Phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, bu t is closely related to pangolin coronavirus.137-138 The SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein , which mediates entry into host cells and is the major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein .144 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat144 and pangolin138 coronavirus es. Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 sequences from Singapore has identified a large nucleotide (382 bp) deletion in ORF -8.200 The effect of this deletion on transmission or virulence is unknown. A recent report of virus mutations within patients ne eds more research.117 Additional analysis of data suggests that the results may be due to experimental methods.98, 239 Structural modeling suggests that specific changes in the genetic sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike Protein may enhance binding of the virus to human ACE2 receptors.164 More specifically, changes to two residues (Q493 and N501) are linked with improving the stability of the virus -receptor binding complex.164 What do we need to know? Research linking genetic changes to differences in phenotype (e.g., transmissibility, virulence, progression in patients) is needed. Are there similar genomic differen ces in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus? If so, do they differ in virulence? CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 4/14/2020 17 Table 1.
