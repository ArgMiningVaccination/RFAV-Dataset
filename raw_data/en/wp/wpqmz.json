Not Applicable It is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the Research (R) Instructions in the [SF424 (R&R) Application Guide](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=12000), except where instructed to do otherwise (in this FOA or in a Notice from [NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/)). Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the FOA) is required and strictly enforced. Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in [Section IV](#_Section_IV._Application_1). When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions. Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review. There are several options available to submit your application through Grants.gov to NIH and Department of Health and Human Services partners. You must use one of these submission options to access the application forms for this opportunity. Purpose The purpose of this funding opportunity is to reduce health disparities through the development and translation of appropriate medical technologies.The NIH defines health disparities as differences in the incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health outcomes that exist among specific population groups. These population groups include racial and ethnic minorities (African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other U.S. Pacific Islanders, as well as subpopulations of all of these racial/ethnic groups), socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, sexual and gender minorities, and medically underserved populations including individuals residing in rural and urban areas (see [https://www.nimhd/nih.gov/about/overview/](https://www.nimhd/nih.gov/about/overview/)). This program seeks advances in medical technologies to reduce health disparities associated [with diseases, illnesses, and conditions of public health importance.] This announcement encourages applications to develop medical devices, imaging systems, robotic systems, biomaterial interfaces, synthetic biological systems, mathematical and modeling solutions, and other technologies to address the healthcare needs of populations that experience health disparities. Proposed medical technologies must have the following basic characteristics: effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and easily accessible to those who need them. Responsive grant applications will involve a formal collaboration with a healthcare organization (including tribal health organizations) or public health agency serving one or more populations that experience health disparities. Background There continues to be an alarming disproportionate burden of illness among minority and other populations that experience health disparities. Overcoming persistent disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes remains a foremost critical challenge. To meet this challenge, the NIH is committed to supporting a wide range of research, aimed at the development innovative medical technologies to reduce, and eventually eliminate, health disparities. Research Objectives and Scope The primary objective of this funding opportunity is to encourage the development and translation of medical technologies, new or existing, that can have a significant impact on healthcare access and health outcomes for populations that experience health disparities. Several barriers to access and adopt such technologies have been identified and are described below. Applications submitted to this funding opportunity should address one or more of these barriers in developing technologies that will impact health disparities. Examples include, but are not limited to: Technologies of interest may be new or may be adaptations of existing technologies that have been redesigned to overcome one or more disparity-related barriers. To be effective, a technology must provide an improvement over the current quality of care for a health disparity population. The technology must also be affordable to the local hospital, community health center, primary care physician, or individual patient in need. For a medical technology to be adopted by a health disparity population, the technology development must be amenable to the population's cultural beliefs and social customs. Acceptance of the technology by the population is critical to the successful delivery of quality healthcare. To be physically delivered to those in need, a technology must be developed within the specifications of the operating environment of the end-user. The technology must be able to function given the existing resources and expertise within populations that experience health disparities. [The impact of the technology should be defined using the most appropriate metrics, such as morbidity, mortality, time, efficiency, costs, etc. ]A non-inclusive list of appropriate medical technologies that might achieve the objectives of this initiative may be found below: Responsive grant applications must involve a formal collaboration with one or more of the following: NIBIB Statement of Interest The NIBIB supports technology development and translation of new or redesigned medical technologies that can have a significant impact on healthcare access and health outcomes for health disparate populations. NIBIB funding of clinical trials will be in accordance with [NOT-EB-21-005](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-eb-21-005.html) \"NIBIB Guidance for Support of Clinical Trial Applications\". NIBIB will only support applications proposing early-stage clinical trials through Phase I, first-in-human, safety, feasibility, or other small clinical trials that inform the early-stage technology development in the submitted application. NIBIB will not support applications proposing Phase II, III, IV or pivotal clinical trials, or trials in which the primary outcome is efficacy, effectiveness, or a post-market concern.Also, mechanistic trials are not supported unless the primary focus of the project is on technology development. NIMHD Statement of Interest The mission of the NIMHD is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. NIMHD supports the study of many aspects of minority health and health disparities\u2014 from biological and population sciences to clinical, behavioral, and translational research, as well as research on health care services, health systems and workforce development. NIMHD focuses on the full continuum of causes of health disparities and the interrelation of these causes. Projects must include a focus on one or more of the following NIH-designated populations that experience health disparities in the United States: African Americans, Latinos/Hispanics, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, less privileged socioeconomic groups, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). Comparison groups/populations may also be included as appropriate for the research questions posed. NIMHD encourages projects that use approaches encompassing multiple domains of influence (e.g., biological, behavioral, sociocultural, environmental, physical environment, health system) and multiple levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, family, peer group, community, societal) to understand and address health disparities (see the NIMHD Research Framework, [https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework.html), for more information). NIMHD will not support animal studies under this FOA. Other Objectives Grantees should plan to take NIBIB's Concept to Clinic Commercializing Innovative (C3i) Education Program ( [https://www.nibib.nih.gov/research-funding/concept-clinic-commercializing-innovation-c3i-program/education](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/research-funding/concept-clinic-commercializing-innovation-c3i-program/education)) in their second or third year of funding. This is a 10-week virtual course offered over the summer months that is designed to provide medical innovators with an educational foundation of business frameworks and tools to assess the opportunity to translate an idea from the lab (concept) to the market (clinic). This FOA requires a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) as part of the application (see Section IV). Applicants are strongly encouraged to read the FOA instructions carefully and view the available [PEDP guidance material](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/plan-enhancing-diverse-perspectives-pedp).

A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official. Recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions](#_5._Funding_Restrictions). Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/part_ii_subpart_b.htm) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain \"applicable clinical trials\" on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm) Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm](//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm) and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). 2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159), including of note, but not limited to: If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions. Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html). HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 and 2 CFR Part 200.206 \"Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\" This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. Not Applicable Data Management and Sharing Note: The NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing is effective for due dates on or after January 25, 2023. Consistent with the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the Data Management and Sharing requirements as outlined in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.2.3_sharing_research_resources.htm#Data). Upon the approval of a Data Management and Sharing Plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described. 3. Reporting When multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the [Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm) annually and financial statements as required in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement.](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.4.1_reporting.htm) A final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.6_closeout.htm). NIH FOAs outline intended research goals and objectives. Post award, NIH will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the RPPR, as described at 45 CFR Part 75.301 and 2 CFR Part 200.301. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All recipients of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available.
