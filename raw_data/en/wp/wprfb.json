We studied the dynamics of innate cell responses in blood using a preclinical model of non-human primates immunized with a live attenuated vaccinia virus, Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), and mass cytometry.

Its route of administration is also crucial, likely by influencing the early innate response, and systemic inflammation, and the vaccine biodistribution. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.", "sitename": "Biorxiv", "date": "2021-10-26", "cleaned_text": "ABSTRACT Innate immunity modulates adaptive immunity and defines the magnitude, quality, and longevity of antigen-specific T- and B- cell immune memory.
