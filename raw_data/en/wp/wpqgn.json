It has been practiced in Asia for more than 2,000 years and has been adapted over the last few hundred years in Europe and the Americas. With acupuncture, sterile, single-use, very fine needles (often as thin as a single hair) are inserted into specific points on the body that are known to alleviate pain and treat various mental and emotional conditions. Nothing is injected into the body when the needles are inserted. There is often minimal or no pain. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, by stimulating acupuncture points, the flow of energy within the body is harmonized and health can be restored. The primary goal of acupuncture therapy is to restore the body's balance. Conventional medicine refers to this balance as homeostasis. Imbalances are common and can occur in one or more body systems. TCM associates these systems with organ names, such as liver, kidney, lung and pericardium, whereas conventional medicine refers to these as the circulatory, nervous, musculoskeletal and endocrine systems. The mechanism underlying acupuncture's effects are being explored and potentially include mediating autonomic nervous system signals. To make an appointment, call us at 949-824-7000. Since acupuncture enhances the body's natural healing processes, it is known to be useful for many conditions. Acupuncture may be given once, several times or more depending on a patient's condition. By reducing inflammation, promoting healing and enhancing immune response, acupuncture is best known for treating pain. Other examples of conditions that are treated by acupuncture are: | | - Arthritis - Asthma - Chemotherapy side effects - Constipation/diarrhea - Digestive disorders - Headaches/migraines | | - Nausea - Neck/back pain - PMS/painful periods - Sciatica - Shoulder pain Our acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine services include: - Acupuncture or electroacupuncture: Acupuncture uses small needles inserted into specific acupoints on the body to treat various conditions. Electroacupuncture is a variation of acupuncture where a small electrical current is passed between pairs of acupuncture needles, augmenting the use of regular acupuncture. A recent study by Samueli Institute researchers has shown that repetitive electroacupuncture releases a kind of natural opioid that lowers blood pressure. The results suggest this therapy may be effective in treating clinical hypertension with few, if any, side effects. - Tai chi: Our classes are taught by UCI Professor Shin Lin, PhD, who has expertise in the practice and research underlying health effects of tai chi. A Chinese martial art practiced for its health benefits, tai chi has been called meditation in motion.
