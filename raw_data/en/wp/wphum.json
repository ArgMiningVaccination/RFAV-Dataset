A favorite of laypeople and professionals alike, the book sold more than a million copies and solidified the author's reputation as one of the world's foremost authorities on medicinal plants. In The Green Pharmacy Guide to Healing Foods, Dr. Duke turns to the broader and even more popular subject of food as medicine, drawing on more than thirty years of research to identify the most powerful healing foods on earth. Whether he is revealing how to beat high cholesterol with blueberries, combat hot flashes with black beans, bash blood sugar spikes with almonds, or help relieve agonizing back pain with pineapple, Dr. Duke's food remedies help treat and prevent the whole gamut of health concerns, from minor (such as sunburn and the common cold) to more serious (like arthritis and diabetes). Dr. Duke has assigned a rating to each remedy, according to his evaluation of the available scientific studies and anecdotal reports. Many of the healing foods recommended here are proving so effective that they may outperform popular pharmaceuticals\u2014minus the risk (and cost). Dr. James A. Duke, PhD, Ethnobotanist, PhD in Botany (UNC, Chapel Hill; Phi Beta Kappa; Distinguished Alumnus), served 3 years with Missouri Botanical Garden, 7 years with Battelle Memorial Institute in Panama, Colombia and Columbus Ohio, as an ecologist; and 27 years as economic botanist, with USDA in Beltsville, Md, On Sept. 30, 1995, he retired from the USDA. Before retiring, Dr. Duke brought his ethnobotanical and phytochemical database online at USDA (http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/). It is now, in Duke's retirement, one of the most frequently consulted areas of the USDA website. Duke serves as distinguished herbal lecturer with the Tai Sophia Healing Institute, Laurel MD. He has written more than 30 books on medicinal plants. This book was a real page turner for me, much more so than his original \"Green Pharmacy\" book on herbs. Who knew that ginger, garlic, chamomile, cinnamon, licorice, and turmeric had such potent healing powers? I'd love to see James Duke and his wife publish a \"farm-aceuticals\" cookbook! I read this after reading The Green Pharmacy Guide to Healing Herbs, so there is a bit of redundancy in it, but it was very interesting to read how different foods have different ways of helping your body to heal. I was glad to see I was already eating what was recommended, but I still jotted down some notes for products to look into eating more of, etc. I recommend this book to people who are interested in nutrition, healthly lifestlyes, etc. It was a good, easy, informative read. I am really into herbs, but it is nice to know that diet can do so much before drugs or herbs or both have be turned to. Granted sometimes something extra beyond diet is needed to kickstart problems into retraction, but diet can take care of most of the rest and this books helps that to be reinforced for me. Overall a good guide if you are into this sort of thing. One little quibble - it needs a better editor. A few spelling mistakes and a couple of other funny mistakes all which should have been caught show up. More of an encyclopedia or reference book, but I had no problems reading it cover to cover. "}
