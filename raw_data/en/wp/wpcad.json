[Dr. Bessheen Baker](/blog/author/dr-bessheen-baker/)- Founder and Owner of Herbs Etc. Background of Homeopathy Homeopathy is derived from the Greek words meaning \"similar,\" and \"suffering,\" this is the pathology of homeopathic health problems. The like cures like principle that homeopathy operates on has been used empirically for more than 200 years and widely acknowledged as significant by an increasing number of research publications. Homeopathic remedies stimulate the body's physiological reactions that restore health naturally with low risk. Why use Homeopathic Solutions? Homeopathy is the second most widely used system of treatment in the world. Its growth in popularity in the United States has been around 25 to 50 percent a year throughout the last decade. This success is fueled by several factors: - Homeopathy is extremely effective. When the correct remedy is taken, results can be rapid, complete and permanent. - Homeopathy is completely safe. Even babies and pregnant women can use homeopathy without the danger of side effects. Homeopathic remedies can also be taken alongside other medication without producing unwanted side effects. - Homeopathy is natural. Homeopathic remedies are normally based on natural ingredients. - Homeopathy works in harmony with your immune system, unlike some conventional medicines which suppress the immune system. (For example, cough medicines suppress the cough reflex, which is your body's attempt to clear the lungs). - Homeopathic remedies are not addictive\u2014once relief is felt, you should stop taking them.
