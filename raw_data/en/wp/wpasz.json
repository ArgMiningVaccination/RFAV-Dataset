Fiber helps to add bulk to the stool, making it easier to pass. If you are not getting enough fiber in your diet, naturopathy can help by recommending foods that are high in fiber or supplements that can help increase your intake. Other common causes of Chronic Constipation include stress, dehydration, and certain medications. Naturopathy can address all of these issues with a variety of different treatments. Treatments for Chronic Constipation Massage Constipation is a common problem that many people experience at some point in their lives. While there are many over-the-counter remedies available, massage can be an effective and natural way to relieve constipation. Massage helps to stimulate the bowels, facilitating movement and relieving constipation. In addition, it is also a relaxing and stress-relieving treatment that can improve your overall wellbeing. If you suffer from chronic constipation, consider giving massages a try - you may be surprised by how helpful it can be. Drink Lots of Water If you suffer from chronic constipation, adding more water to your daily diet could help improve your symptoms. Water helps to soften stools and makes them easier to pass, which can relieve the discomfort of chronic constipation. Drinking plenty of fluids also helps keep the colon hydrated and healthy, which is important for regularity. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water per day, but more if needed. If you find that drinking plain water is not enough, add fruit juices or herbal teas to your diet to increase your fluid intake. Exercise It's no secret that exercise is good for you. It keeps your body healthy and helps you stay in shape. But did you know that it can also help relieve chronic constipation? Exercise helps get your blood flowing and your bowels moving.
