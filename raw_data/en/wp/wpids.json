Whether the publication contains news items and articles of opinion of a general character separate from discussions concerning candidates and public af fairs; 4. How widely the publication is circulated or is otherwise made available to the public in comparison to a tar geted audience for potential campaign purposes; 5. Whether the publication discusses all candidates for a particular election or otherwise gives all candidates equal space; and 6.

Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code sections 237.3 and 234.6, the Department of Human Services proposes to amend Chapter 1 12, \"Licensing and Regulation of Child Foster Care Facilities,\" Chapter 1 13, \"Licensing and Regulation of Foster Family Homes,\" Chapter 1 17, \"Foster Parent T raining,\" Chapter 156, \"Payments for Foster Care and Foster Parent T raining,\" Chapter 200, \"Adoption Services,\" and Chapter 202, \"Foster Care Services,\" Iowa Administrative Code. The proposed amendments update provisions for foster family home licensing and training and for foster care and adoption services to: Reflect the Department' s current contracting arrangements and procedures. Incorporate changes to comply with federal law and regulations and support the Department' s position for federal Child and Family Service Reviews. Incorporate changes suggested by Department staf f and stakeholders. Insert numbering to comply with current standards for administrative rules. The amendments to Chapter 1 12 would: Clarify application provisions for foster care licenses for both foster family and group care. Extend the time limit for a decision on an initial foster family home license application from 90 days to 140 days if the applicant must complete the 30-hour preservice training course or to 120 days if the course is waived. The Department' s experience is that current requirements for training and for national criminal record checks often cannot be completed within 90 days of the application date. Provide that the Department shall not act on a family' s reapplication for licensing if the family' s license has been denied or revoked within the last 12 months. Add refusal of the foster family to engage as a resource to the foster child' s birth parents as grounds for denial of a renewal application. Clarify that mandatory child abuse reporter training must be approved by the Iowa Department of Public Health. Clarify that a foster family' s training documentation shall be submitted to the Department' s statewide contractor for the recruitment and retention of resource (foster and adoptive) families. Update or ganizational terminology . The amendments to Chapter 1 13 would: Rescind definitions of unused terms and add new definitions. Add an overview of the steps in the licensing process, including a list of forms and documentation that the applicant family must submit. Allow waiver of any licensing standard that can be waived without a negative impact on the safety or well-being of the foster child. Public Law 1 10-351, the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, requires this waiver provision. (The Department will not have the authority to waive standards set in state or federal law .) Add more physical requirements for bedrooms used by foster children and for family sleeping arrangements. Prohibit smoking in the foster family home or vehicle when foster children are present, based on a recommendation from the Department' s Child Death Review T eam. Require foster parent applicants to make a visual inspection for lead-paint hazards and apply interim controls to mitigate any potential hazard identified. This provision is required by 2008 Iowa Acts, chapter 1 187, section 35. 2176 NOTICES IAB 4/8/09 HUMAN SER VICES DEP AR TMENT[441](cont'd) Add a minimum temperature requirement for bedrooms and prohibit use of kerosene heaters or gas-fired space heaters in the foster family home. W aive the water -testing requirement after a family has made alternative arrangements for safe water for three consecutive years. Require each floor where foster children would sleep to have a working smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector as well as a window exit that meets specified dimensions. Add safety requirements related to combustion hazards, safety plans, medications and poisonous substances, weapons and firearms, transporting and supervising foster children, and pets or outdoor animals with which a foster child may come into contact. Move foster parent training standards to Chapter 1 17, except for a summary list of requirements. Require the foster family to actively ensure that the foster child stays connected to the child' s kin, culture, and community as required in the child' s case permanency plan. Require that records about the foster child be provided to the supervising agency or to the child' s parent or guardian when the child leaves the placement. Allow the licensing worker discretion to request an updated health report from the foster family . Set a minimum age requirement of 21 and make minor changes to the requirements for the personal characteristics of the foster parents. Clarify the scope of assessment and the timing for the required unannounced visit, which is now made by the recruitment and retention contractor . Deficiencies found will be referred to the Department' s licensing worker for joint planning with the foster family on improvement. Clarify the requirements on working with the foster child' s school and consulting with the child' s parents about participation in the child' s culture and religion. Clarify the requirements on training and discipline of foster children and provide that if the child' s treatment plan includes the use of restraints, the foster parents shall receive training in the safe and appropriate use of restraints. Add requirements for alternative care during a foster parent' s emer gency absence and reporting absences and other changes of circumstances that could af fect the health, safety or welfare of a foster child in the family' s care. The amendments to Chapter 1 17 would: Incorporate the training requirements previously included in Chapter 1 13. Require approval of the area social work administrator or designee for a preservice training session to an individual family instead of a group. Clarify that the Department' s recruitment and retention contractor is responsible for providing orientation and managing preservice training. Clarify requirements for approval and crediting of in-service training, including designating a training cycle that is of fset from the licensing period, so that license renewal will not be delayed when the foster parent needs to complete the annual training requirement. Require training in medication management, CPR, first aid, and child abuse reporting during the first year of licensing. The Child Death Review T eam has recommended that training in first aid and CPR be mandatory . Require completion of the course \"Caring for Children W ith HIV\" before placement of an HIV -infected child with the family . Incorporate the rules on training stipends and trainer fees that were previously in Chapter 156. The amendments to Chapter 156 would: Change the chapter title to reflect the removal of foster parent training provisions. Remove unused definitions and update definitions to remove obsolete references and terminology . Provide for recovery of overpayments made to a foster family . Require a foster family that provides child care to be registered pursuant to 441\u2014Chapter 1 10 and prohibit the family from displacing the foster child to another child care facility . Clarify provisions for payment in a preadoptive placement. Update language on the contracts required for provider payment. The amendments to Chapter 200 would: IAB 4/8/09 NOTICES 2177 HUMAN SER VICES DEP AR TMENT[441](cont'd) Amend and add definitions and update form references. Clarify the role of the recruitment and retention contractor in doing adoptive home studies, preparing families for adoption, and providing support to adoptive families. Clarify the role of the Department adoption worker in preplacement and postplacement services. Rescind rules on the methods of service provision, fees for services, and international adoptions. Since the Department will accept applications for adoption only for special needs children, fees do not apply . International adoptions are handled through private child-placing agencies. The amendments to Chapter 202 would: Update the definition of \"foster care\" to match the definition in Chapter 156. Add new definitions of \"family safety , risk, and permanency service,\" \"foster family adoption,\" \"resource family ,\" and \"social history .\" Require a genogram of the child' s family as part of the assessment of the need for foster care placement. Add requirements on record checks for relatives who may accept placement of the child. Prohibit placement of a child who has asthma or other respiratory disease in a foster family home where any member of the household smokes. Add requirements for furnishing information to the foster care provider which were previously included in Chapter 1 13. Require monthly visits by the caseworker to the child' s parents. Clarify the provision of services to children in foster family placement. Other than the licensing waivers mentioned above, these amendments do not provide for waivers in specified situations. Requests for the waiver of any rule may be submitted under the Department' s general rule on exceptions at 441\u20141.8(17A,217).

Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code sections 17A.4, 476.1, and 476.2, the Utilities Board (Board) gives notice that on March 12, 2009, the Board issued an order in Docket No. RMU-2009-0002, I n r e : N o t i fi c a t i o n R e q u i r e m e n t s f o r C e r t i fi c a t e d L o c a l E x c h a n g e C o m p a n i e s [ 1 9 9 I A C 2 2 . 2 ( 9 ) ] , \"Order Commencing Rule Making,\" that proposes a new subrule that establishes notification requirements specifically for certificated local exchange carriers when loss of service to customers meets certain criteria. The Board is proposing the new subrule based upon its experience since the adoption of the existing notification requirements in March 2008. In those requirements, the Board adopted notification standards for all communications companies, including wireless communications companies, that mirrored the notification requirements of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Over the past year , in most cases the Board has not received immediate notification of events during which there has been a significant loss of communications service to customers. Notification of these events has often come hours or even days after the service disruption began, and in some cases service had already been restored. The primary reasons for the lack of timely notice is that reporting did not occur until the outage had met the FCC threshold for number of lost call minutes or notification was not made at the same time that it was sent to the FCC. In the proposed new subrule, the Board establishes standards for notification that should provide more timely notice of outages. T imely notice of significant outages is needed to meet the Board' s responsibility to keep local and state emer gency management agencies and the Governor ' s of fice informed of these events. The order commencing rule making can be found using the Board' s electronic filing system (EFS) W eb site at h t t p : / / e f s . i o w a . g o v . Pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.4(1)\"a\" and \"b,\" any interested person may file a written statement of position pertaining to the proposed amendment.

Instructions for making an electronic filing can be found on the EFS W eb site at h t t p : / / e f s . i o w a . g o v . Any person who does not have access to the Internet may file comments on paper pursuant to 199 IAC 14.4(5). An original and ten copies of paper comments shall be filed.

All paper communications should be directed to the Executive Secretary , Utilities Board, 350 Maple Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50319-0069.

Persons with disabilities who require assistive services or devices to observe or participate should contact the Utilities Board at (515)281-5256 at least five days in advance of the scheduled date to request that appropriate arrangements be made. This amendment is intended to implement Iowa Code sections 17A.4, 476.1, and 476.2. The following amendment is proposed. Adopt the following n e w subrule 22.2(9) : 22.2(9) for certificated local exchange carriers. Certificated local exchange carriers shall notify the board as soon as practical and within at least two hours after the carrier learns of an outage that meets the criteria in this subrule by calling the board duty of ficer at 515-745-2332 or by sending an electronic message to the duty of ficer at 2254 NOTICES IAB 4/8/09 UTILITIES DIVISION[199](cont'd) I U B D u t y O f fi c e r @ i u b . s t a t e . i a . u s .

IAB 4/8/09 FILED EMERGENCY 2255 ARC 7709B ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT , IOW A DEP AR TMENT OF [261] Adopted and Filed Emergency Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code sections 15.105 and 15.106, the Department of Economic Development adopts new Chapter 27, \"Neighborhood Stabilization Program,\" Iowa Administrative Code. These rules are intended to implement the newly authorized Neighborhood Stabilization Program through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds were authorized by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 as an adjunct to the Community Development Block Grant Program. The rules describe eligibility requirements, establish application review and approval procedures, and describe fund allocation. The IDED Board adopted the rules on March 19, 2009. In compliance with Iowa Code section 17A.4(3), the Department finds that notice and public participation are impracticable and contrary to the public interest because the federal regulations governing the program require that all funding be obligated within 18 months. In order to meet this deadline, communities will need to begin their activities as soon as possible. In most cases, the activities will entail acquiring property , rehabilitating the property , and reselling it. These activities are dif ficult to accomplish in a short period of time. The Department finds, pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.5(2)\"b\"(2) that the normal ef fective date of these rules should be waived and the rules be made ef fective upon filing with the Administrative Rules Coordinator on March 20, 2009. These rules confer a benefit on the public by providing financial assistance for the repair and redevelopment of properties within the recipient communities. These rules are also published herein under Notice of Intended Action as ARC 7710B to allow for public comment. These rules became ef fective on March 20, 2009. These rules are intended to implement Iowa Code sections 15.108(1 1) and 15.109 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The following amendment is adopted.

ARC 7667B HUMAN SER VICES DEP AR TMENT [441] Adopted and Filed Emergency Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code section 249A.4, the Department of Human Services amends Chapter 92, \"IowaCare,\" Iowa Administrative Code. This amendment reflects the annual update in IowaCare premiums as required by Iowa Code section 249J.8. Premiums are recalculated annually based on changes in federal poverty income guidelines published each year by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. By law , the monthly IAB 4/8/09 FILED EMERGENCY 2261 HUMAN SER VICES DEP AR TMENT[441](cont'd) premium shall not exceed one-twelfth of 5 percent of the member ' s annual family income. Members whose family income is less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level pay no premium. These recalculations have resulted in a premium increase of $2, $3 or $4 per month. The new premium amounts will be applied to new applications and renewal applications. A member ' s premium does not change during the member ' s approved enrollment period. Because the income thresholds for each level also change due to the new poverty income guidelines, the premium may be moved to a lower level at renewal if the member ' s income remains unchanged. This amendment does not provide for waivers in specified situations because all households should be subject to the same sliding-scale premiums. Requests for the waiver of any rule may be submitted under the Department' s general rule on exceptions at 441\u20141.8(17A,217). The Council on Human Services adopted this amendment on March 1 1, 2009. In compliance with Iowa Code section 17A.4(3), the Department finds that notice and public participation are unnecessary because this amendment simply reflects the implementation of an existing methodology that is already adopted in statute and rules. The Department also finds that this amendment confers a benefit by avoiding confusion about the application of the rule. The amounts cited in 441\u2014paragraph 92.7(1)\"a\" of the Iowa Administrative Code conform to the updated amounts that took ef fect April 1, 2009, based on paragraph 92.7(1)\"b.\" Therefore, this amendment is filed pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.5(2)\"b\"(2), and the normal ef fective date of the amendment is waived. This amendment became ef fective April 1, 2009. This amendment is intended to implement Iowa Code section 249J.8. The following amendment is adopted. Amend paragraph 92.7(1)\"a\" as follows: a. The monthly premium amount is based on the household' s countable monthly income as a percentage of the federal poverty level for a household of that size. Ef fective April 1, 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 , premium amounts based on this percentage are as follows: When the household' s income is at or below: Each member ' s premium amount is: 100% of federal poverty level $ 0 1 10% of federal poverty level $ 4 3 $ 4 5 120% of federal poverty level $ 4 7 $ 4 9 130% of federal poverty level $ 5 2 $ 5 4 140% of federal poverty level $ 5 6 $ 5 8 150% of federal poverty level $ 6 0 $ 6 3 160% of federal poverty level $ 6 4 $ 6 7 170% of federal poverty level $ 6 9 $ 7 2 180% of federal poverty level $ 7 3 $ 7 6 190% of federal poverty level $ 7 7 $ 8 1 200% of federal poverty level $ 8 2 $ S N OTE : For replacement pages for IAC, see IAC Supplement 4/8/09. 2262 FILED EMERGENCY IAB 4/8/09 ARC 7700B IOW A FINANCE AUTHORITY [265] Adopted and Filed Emergency Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code sections 17A.3(1)\"b\" and 16.5(1)\"r ,\" the Iowa Finance Authority hereby amends Chapter 12, \"Low-Income Housing T ax Credits,\" Iowa Administrative Code. These amendments update and replace the current Low Income T ax Credit Program Compliance Monitoring Manual with an updated compliance monitoring manual, which is incorporated by reference in rule 265\u201412.3(16).

The Authority is also simultaneously publishing a Notice of Intended Action as ARC 7701B herein. The purpose of the Notice is to solicit comment on these amendments. The Authority finds that adoption of these amendments confers a benefit on developers and prospective tenants of low-income housing, in that the rules ease and speed the administration of an important program that facilitates the development and maintenance of decent, af fordable housing. The Authority finds that these amendments should be implemented as soon as feasible in order to implement the beneficial aspects of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and to ensure timely compliance with all applicable requirements of state and federal law .

This amendment adopts by reference changes to IAC 561\u2014Chapter 8 (Natural Resources Department). The amendments to 561\u2014Chapter 8 change the threshold amount for which the Department of Natural Resources must seek approval from the Natural Resource Commission for public improvement projects and make other small modifications to align the bidding requirements with Iowa Code chapter 26. The thresholds are in line with changes to Iowa Code chapter 26. Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin on January 28, 2009, as ARC 7535B .

ARC 7680B NA TURAL RESOURCE COMMISSION [571] Adopted and Filed Emergency After Notice Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code subsection 455A.5(6), the Natural Resource Commission hereby rescinds Chapter 78, \"Ginseng Harvesting and Sale,\" Iowa Administrative Code, and adopts a new Chapter 78 with the same title. The new chapter better defines wild and cultivated ginseng, green and dry ginseng, and those persons permitted to harvest and sell ginseng, and prohibits the harvesting or planting of ginseng on state-owned 2264 FILED EMERGENCY IAB 4/8/09 NA TURAL RESOURCE COMMISSION[571](cont'd) and state-managed lands. The new chapter also clarifies the fees char ged for permits issued under these rules, the restrictions and prohibitions for harvesting wild ginseng, and the record-keeping and reporting requirements related to ginseng transactions. Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin on January 14, 2009, as ARC 7498B . The Department held a public hearing utilizing the Iowa Communications Network (ICN) on February 4, 2009, at 6 p.m. The Department utilized 1 1 locations around the state, with particular emphasis in those areas where ginseng harvesting and dealing are most prevalent. The Department received 26 comments, some positive and some negative. Most of the 10 positive comments praised the Department' s ef forts to protect the resource. The negative comments included concerns about the prohibition against legal harvest on state lands, the Department' s not providing a program for seed distribution, and the requirement that harvesters carry out the tops of the plants when harvesting. In addition to grammatical corrections and minor clarifications that have been made since the Notice, the Department has made the following changes to the rules: 1. Used the biologically correct term \"rhizome\" when appropriate and defined \"root\" to include a rhizome; 2. Modified the definitions of the dif ferent types of ginseng in response to comments received by the United States Fish and W ildlife Service, the entity responsible for the oversight of the Convention on International T rade in Endangered Species of W ild Fauna and Flora; 3. Made an exception to the harvest prohibitions in subrule 78.5(1) to allow commercial plant nurseries to maintain ginseng plants throughout the year; provided for a second type of dealer license, as described in paragraph 78.6(2)\"c,\" that allows Iowa resident dealers transacting in less than five pounds of dry-weight ginseng per license year to pay a diminished fee for their licenses; and modified the license year for dealers in paragraph 78.6(2)\"d\" to be consistent with other dates in the rule; 4. Provided a recommended method to collect seeds from plants when wild ginseng is harvested and replanted pursuant to subrule 78.12(1); 5. Changed planting requirements in subrule 78.12(2) from two inches to one inch; removed suspension and modification from rule 571\u201478.17(456A) as actions the Department could take against violators; and clarified that reciprocity restrictions are only applicable to those states that allow for the harvest, cultivation and dealing of ginseng but do not extend those privileges to Iowa residents. Pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.5(2)\"b\"(2), these rules became ef fective April 1, 2009. The license year for ginseng dealers in the state is April 1 to March 31 of the following year . Therefore, the emer gency adoption is necessary in order to ensure that the regulations are in place for the entire license year , as opposed to having the regulated community bound to two separate sets of regulations for one license year . This amendment is intended to implement Iowa Code section 456A.24(1 1). This amendment became ef fective April 1, 2009. The following amendment is adopted.

These amendments change the threshold amount for which the Department of Natural Resources may approve public improvement projects and make other small modifications to align the bidding requirements with Iowa Code chapter 26. The thresholds established in this rule making are in line with changes to Iowa Code chapter 26. Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin on January 28, 2009, as ARC 7534B . The Department received no comments on the amendments. Since publication of the Notice, two changes have been made to subrule 8.4(1). As a result of concerns raised by members of the Natural Resource Commission, the second sentence in subrule 8.4(1) now reads as follows: \"All contracts for public improvements in excess of $50,000 shall be approved by the director and the appropriate commission.\" That amount had been set at $100,000 rather than $50,000 in the Notice. Additionally , to improve clarity , the phrase \"less than $25,000\" in the last sentence of subrule 8.4(1) has been changed to \"for amounts of $25,000 or less.\" The Department finds that the adoption of these amendments will provide a benefit to individuals and companies that bid on public improvement projects by virtue of an expedited process.

In 2008, new Chapter 50, which describes the purpose and responsibilities of the State Dental Director and the Oral Health Bureau, was Adopted and Filed and published in the July 30, 2008, Iowa Administrative Bulletin as ARC 7023B , to become ef fective September 3, 2008. At its meeting held on 2274 FILED EMERGENCY IAB 4/8/09 PUBLIC HEAL TH DEP AR TMENT[641](cont'd) August 12, 2008, the Administrative Rules Review Committee voted to delay the ef fective date of these rules for 70 days to allow for additional discussion and review at the Committee' s September 9, 2008, meeting. The Committee imposed the 70-day delay over questions about the possibility of nondental professionals' performing dental treatment under these rules. Committee members requested that the Department meet with stakeholders and work to resolve these questions. Following additional review at the Committee' s October 14, 2008, meeting, the Committee voted to impose a legislative session delay on the definition of the term \"dental home,\" as published in rule 641\u201450.2(135). The ef fect of that action was to delay the ef fective date of the definition of \"dental home\" until the adjournment of the regular 2009 Session of the General Assembly . The remaining provisions of Chapter 50 (as published in ARC 7023B ) went into ef fect on November 12, 2008, upon the expiration of the 70-day delay . The Department and stakeholders have agreed to a revised definition of \"dental home.\" In compliance with Iowa Code section 17A.4(3), the Department finds that notice and public participation are unnecessary because the amendment is the result of public participation from the original filing that had been delayed. The Department also finds, pursuant to Iowa Code section 17A.5(2)\"b\"(2), that the normal ef fective date of the amendment should be waived and this amendment should be made ef fective April 15, 2009, as it confers a benefit on the public to have the agreed-upon definition ef fective prior to the end of the 2009 Session of the General Assembly when the original definition would become ef fective. The State Board of Health adopted this amendment on March 1 1, 2009. This amendment will become ef fective on April 15, 2009.

ARC 7687B NA TURAL RESOURCE COMMISSION [571] Adopted and Filed Pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code subsection 455A.5(6), the Natural Resource Commission hereby amends Chapter 94, \"Nonresident Deer Hunting,\" Iowa Administrative Code. Chapter 94 gives the regulations for nonresident deer hunting and includes season dates, bag limits, possession limits, shooting hours, areas open to hunting, licensing procedures, means and methods of taking, and transportation and reporting requirements. The amendment to subrule 94.6(2) adds 1,000 licenses to the quota for optional antlerless-only licenses. This change should allow more does to be taken in counties where the doe harvest needs to be increased to meet the Department' s goals. The change should also allow more former residents to return and hunt with their families and traditional groups. The amendment to subrule 94.7(6) revises the paragraph that requires hunters during the shotgun seasons to use hunter orange on blinds. This change makes the requirements the same for both residents and nonresidents during the regular gun season. The amendment to rule 571\u201494.12(481A) allows nonresidents to obtain antlerless-only licenses for the January antlerless season. These licenses will come from the resident quota in those counties where the resident quota has not filled and will go on sale to nonresidents on January 1 1. All regulations that apply to resident hunters during the January season will apply to nonresident hunters as well. This change will allow more does to be taken in those counties where the doe harvest needs to be increased to meet the Department' s goals. Notice of Intended Action was published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin on January 14, 2009, as ARC 7500B . A public hearing was held on February 13, 2009. No comments were received. Since the Notice was published, one change has been made in rule 571\u201494.12(481A). The date that the January antlerless-only licenses go on sale to nonresidents was changed from January 3 to January 1 1 so that nonresidents will not be able to buy these licenses until after the resident late muzzleloader season ends on January 10. These amendments are intended to implement Iowa Code sections 481A.38, 481A.39, 481A.48, 483A.1 and 483A.8. These amendments shall become ef fective May 13, 2009.

No more than 6,000 any-deer licenses and 6,000 mandatory antlerless-only licenses will be issued for all methods of take combined, for the entire state. Of the 6,000 any-deer and 6,000 mandatory antlerless-only licenses, no more than 35 percent in any zone can be bow licenses.
