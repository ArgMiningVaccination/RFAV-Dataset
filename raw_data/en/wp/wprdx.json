This is my daughter, Sadie, aka Miss 11, and Saturday was her birthday. Miss 11's birth story is an excellent example of balance between lifestyle health and the use of allopathic medicine. While 8 months pregnant with Sadie, a routine ultrasound found a small mass in Sadie's abdomen. It was determined to be a cyst. But where this cyst was growing was the mystery. The mid-wife practice I was going to in a local health care system made me an appointment with the high risk pregnancy practice at Albany Medical Center. We went to that appointment and the doctors immediately admitted me to the hospital. I was confused and scared but did what they recommended. During my day and a half in the hospital, I was taken for an MRI to see if they could definitively figure out where this 2 cm cyst was in Sadie's abdomen. The hospital stay was an awful experience. I was woken every few hours. I had to lay in a bed that really hurt my tailbone area and the food was the exact opposite of what a pregnant mother should eat...I pretty much drank coffee for this entire stay. I had a candid conversation with a nurse and explained to her that I couldn't possibly take care of myself the way a pregnant woman should, in that environment. She advocated on my behalf and in just a few hours I had my discharge papers. After the appointment at Albany Medical, I was unwelcome at my mid-wife practice, not by the mid-wives per say, but by the healthcare system in which it resides. They wouldn't even do a simple stress test for me. Even when Albany Medical called them directly, the answer was no. I was now what they deemed to be \"high risk.\".... So, I would have to continue to drive 200 miles round trip to seek pre-natal care. So back to the high risk pregnancy clinic...The doctors were able to determine that the cyst was not life threatening, but they were not able to figure out exactly what organ the cyst was on. They were concerned that the cyst might be on the bowel, because that would require emergency surgery right after birth. After the first failed attempt at inducing, I had to strongly advocate for myself and was able to go home after an exhausting 48 hours of no sleep, lots of dilation checks and other painful medical interventions. I was only able to do this because I had amazing nurses that gave me advice and could see me for healthy me instead of seeing me for the high risk category I was put in. After failed inducing number 2, I was able to have a candid conversation with a doctor. I was seeking her advice because my objective was to avoid a C-section. I knew that the baby would more than likely need to have surgery and I wanted to ensure I could take care of her and not have to deal with my own recovery too. This doctor told me exactly what to do and what to say in order to get my desired outcome. Well, inducing number 3 was a success! My water broke in the middle of the night and by early afternoon the next day I was fully dilated and ready to give birth. BUT...when receiving an epidural, the baby's heartbeat greatly slowed on the monitor. Immediately a swarm of at least 10 nurses and doctors filed into my room. They all took their positions and went to work. One rolled me onto my side while another shook my belly. I don't remember exactly what else went on, but what I remember the most of was a feeling of calm and protection. I knew that even if I had to be wheeled to the OR for an emergency C-section everything would be okay. I knew this buzzing swarm of nurses and doctors would save our lives, if it came to that. But it didn't. I gave birth in the middle of the afternoon to Sadie Grace McKown. She had an ultrasound that afternoon and it was determined that the cyst was indeed on her left ovary, but that it had pretty much engulfed the ovary so it was no flopped over to the right. They performed surgery her second day of life and everything went so well and we had just a 6 day stay in the NICU. One of the NICU nurses was quite impressed with the deep yellow color of my milk. She said it looked like Sunny-D. :) I'm quite convinced that without the developments in allopathic medicine, even a hundred years ago there might have been a very different outcome. Pathology of the cyst and ovary showed that necrosis had set in and the surgeon said that typically the next step is gangrene. Without the ability to localize and treat the problem, she likely would not have lived. I am also quite convinced that without my lifestyle health practice, I likely would not have been able to have a vaginal birth. It's possible that the first induction would have taken and Sadie would have been born a few weeks premature. She may not have been able to breeze through surgery so easily. The NICU nurses prepped us that Sadie would be intubated when she came back from surgery. But that wasn't the case, she was very strong and healthy and came back to the NICU nurse exactly as she left. The nurses were so pleasantly surprised. And we might not have been able to leave the NICU after just 6 days. So even though I was kicked out of my mid-wife practice during my 8th month of pregnancy, I was very thankful for the staff and our care at Albany Medical. There happened to be a senior resident who was on shift during all 3 induces. He actually delivered Sadie. So with Dr. Kittle's presence, we did end up with a sense of familiarity. I remember a few days after surgery, we ran into one of the OR nurses in the lobby of the hospital and she stopped us to check up on Sadie. It turned out we got to be cared for by an excellent group of medical professionals. I'm so thankful and grateful. And I did my part well, as well. I didn't lay the entire responsibility for the outcome on them. I did my part by taking care of my body through lifestyle health. I gave the docs and nurses a pallet with which they could easily and successfully do their jobs. An ideal balance between allopathic medicine and lifestyle health. "}
