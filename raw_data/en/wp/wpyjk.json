They were of the view that \"a healthy body ensures a healthy mind\". People were advised by their rulers to build their homes in healthy areas away from swamps, drains and marshes to prevent diseases such as malaria. - Metadata: [xml](https://hcommons.org/deposits/download/hc:28519/descMetadata/xml/) - Published as: - Journal article Show details - Publisher: - SAHkartell - Pub.
