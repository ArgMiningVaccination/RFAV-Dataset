Items are listed by Department, then by bill number. 1 New Business San Francisco Animal Care and Control & Office of the City Administrator Presenter: Angela Yip AB 595 (Essayi): Animal shelters: 72 -hour public notice: euthanasia: study Recommended Position: Oppose The March 21 revisions require 72 -hour public notice before the euthanasia of any animal except in cases of irremediable suffering, newborns without maternal care, and dogs with a documented history of vicious/dangerous b ehavior. It imposes criminal penalties for violations. The bill would create new requirements on Animal Care and Control agencies, and it is an unfunded mandate. Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing Presenter: Dylan Schneider AB 441 (Haney ): Earned Income Tax Credit: young child tax credit: foster youth tax credit: periodic payments Recommended Position: Support AB 441 would allow Californians to receive advance monthly payments of their CalEITC, Young Child Tax Credit, and Foster Youth Tax Credit, if the combined value of the credits is $1,000 or greater. SB 37 (Caballero): Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities Housing Stability Act Recommended Position: Support SB 37 would establish a multi -year Rent Stabilization Fund to provide a mix of shallow and deep subsidies to help older adults and people with disabilities afford fair market rate rent and transition to permanent housing assistance programs, including federally funded subsidies like the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. SB 37 would also encourage the Department of Housing and Community Development to fund and work with a variety of community -based organizations who provide housing and services to older adults and people with disabilities. SB 657 (Caballero): Homelessness services staff training Recommended Position: Support SB 657 would require the Interagency Council on Homelessness (\"council\") to coordinate with the California continuums of care and the area agencies on aging to partner in their shared regions to provide gerontological training for homelessness services staff, to ensure that homelessness service providers are well trained and well equipped to assist vulnerable older adults with accessing resources to gain a permanent housing solution. 2 Department of Public Health Presenter: Max Gara AB 608 (Schiavo ): Medi-Cal: Comprehensive Perinatal Services Recommended Position: Support AB 608 ensures more Californians have a healthy start to life by extending the Comprehensive Perinatal Services Program for Medi -Cal members to one year postpartum. The bill also allows perinatal health workers to provide preventive services outside of a clinic. AB 1057 (Weber ): California Home Visiting Program Recommended Position: Support The California Home Visiting Program (CHVP) is a voluntary program created by the State Department of Public Health to support pregnant people and parents with young children who live in communities that face greater risks and barriers to achieving positive maternal and child health outcomes. AB 1057 would boost the reach and impact of CHVP by giving additional flexibility to local health jurisdictions to administer Home Visiting Programs that address the unique needs of their communities and better provide support to families who need it most. Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector Presenter: Michelle Lau SB 618 (Rubio): End Debt Trap Act Recommended Position: Support This bill would eliminate the collection and accrual of interest on child support debt owed to the government for public assistance repayment. San Francisco Human Services Agency Presenter: Rod Finetti AB 366 (Petrie -Norris): County human services agencies: workforce development Recommended Position: Support AB 366 by Assembly Member Petrie -Norris would provide funding and resources, as well as reduce barriers, to address significant workforce shortages in county human services programs. AB 386 (Nguyen): California Right to Financial Privacy Act Recommended Position: Support This bill would improve the capability of Adult Protective Services (APS) to fulfill its obligation to protect seniors and disabled adults from the growing threat of financial a buse. AB 605 (Arambula): CalFresh Fruit and Vegetable Supplemental Benefits Expansion Program Recommended Position: Support AB 605 (Arambula) would expand the number and geographic diversity of retailers offering fruit and vegetable supplemental benefits to CalFresh. 3 San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Presenter: Katie Angotti AB 361 (Ward): Vehicles: video imaging of bicycle lane parking violations Recommended Position: Support This bill authorizes a local agency to use automated forward- facing parking control devices on city owned enforcement vehicles to cite vehicles parked in a bike lane. San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency & Department on the Status of Women Presenter: Katie Angotti SB 434 (Min): Transit operators: street harassment survey Recommended Position: Support This bill requires the top ten public transit operators, including the SFMTA, upon appropriation of funds by the Legislature to collect and publish survey data and conduct outreach activities for the purpose of informing their efforts to improve the safety of riders and reduce street harassment on public transit. The bill requires transit operators, by December 31, 2024, to publish the survey data on their websites and inform the Governor and the Legis lature. San Francisco Public Utilities Commission Presenter: Scott Ammon SB 83 (Wiener): Public utilities: electrical distribution grid: interconnection Recommended Position: Support This bill would require electrical corporations to interconnect development projects to the electrical distribution grid within eight weeks of a project receiving a \"Green Tag\" from a governmental agency. Issuance of a Green Tag would confirm that all prerequisite work and approvals necessary for interconnection of a development project to the grid have been completed and received by the project applicant. The bill would require electrical corporations to compensate project applicants in the event that the electrical corporation fails to interconnect the project to the grid within the eight week timeline. The bill would also require electrical corporations to provide an annual report to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on the number of interconnection applications received within the previous 12 months and the time period for interconnecting these projects to the grid. The SFPUC recommends a support position for SB 83. Presenter: Rebecca Peacock SB 778 (Ochoa Bogh): Excavations: subsurface installations Recommended Position: Oppose unless amended This bill wo uld remove the exemption for nonpressurized sewer lines and storm drains from California' s Dig Safe Law. It also makes other changes, such as revising requirements around notification of operators, use of vacuum equipment, and processes regarding discrepan cies in excavation area delineation. 4 Environment Department Presenter: Kyle Wehner AB 496 (Friedman): Cosmetic safety Recommended Position: Support This bill prohibits the sale in California of cosmetic products containing any one of 26 carcinogens, reproductive toxins, and endocrine disruptors beginning January 1, 2025. AB 1290 (Rivas): Eliminating Problematic Plastics Act Recommended Position: Support This bill would prohibit in California the manufacture, sale, or distribution of opaque or pigmented polyethylene terephthalate bottles, and plastic packaging containing certain chemicals, pigments, or additives beginning January 1, 2026. SB 253 (Wiener): Corporate Climate Data Accountability Act Recommended Position: Support This bill would require large companies doing business in California to publicly disclose their Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This bill will hold businesses accountable for the entire lifecycle of their operational impacts and contributions to climate change. SB 261 (Stern): Climate -Related Risk Disclosure Act Recommended Position: Support This bill would require large companies doing business in California to publicly report their climate -related financial risk. This bill would ensure that financial institutio ns and businesses are taking the necessary steps to mitigate and adapt to global climate impacts. SB 511 (Blakespear): Greenhouse gas emissions inventories Recommended Position: Support The bill would instruct the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to publish greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory data for municipalities on a publicly accessible database to help simplify climate action planning for municipalities in California. This legislation would help shift municipal resources away from time - consuming GHG accounting activities and toward impactful, consistent, and standardized implementation of climate programs. SB 707 (Newman ): Responsible Textile Recovery Act of 2023 Recommended Position: Support SB 707 creates a statewide textile repair and recycling extended producer responsibility program to reduce the increasing volume of unusable textiles in landfills. 5 Department of Early Childhood Presenter: Graham Dobson AB 244 (Wilson): Specialized Inclusivity Training for Child Care Staff Grant Program Recommended Position: Support This bill would establish the Specialized Inclusivity Training for Child Care Staff Grant Program to fund staff training on including children with disabilities and improve access to child care for children with disabilities in California. AB 596 (Reyes): Child Care Rate Reform and Suspension of Family Fees Recommended Position: Support AB 596 will help early learning and childcare providers and families by transitioning providers to a single cost based reimbursement rate, suspending family fees until an equitable sliding scale for family fees is established, and funding providers using an enrollment based contract earning mechanism. This is a companion bill to SB 380 (Reyes). SB 380 (Limon): Child care: statewide pilot policies: individualized county childcare subsidy plans. Recommended Position: Support SB 380 will help early learning and childcare providers and families by transitioning providers to a single cost based reimbursement rate, suspending family fees until an equitable sliding scale for family fees is established, and funding providers using an enrollment based contract earning mechanism. This is a companion bill to AB 596 (Limon). SB 635 (Menjivar): Early Education scree nings Recommended Position: Support SB 635 would provide tens of thousands of children with access to early childhood developmental screening and other appropriate developmental screenings. It would also ensure that children ages 0 -5 who need additional services after screening are referred for further assessment and intervention at no cost to the parent. Department of Children Youth and Their Families Presenter: Jasmine Dawson SB 274 (Skinner): Suspensions and Expulsions: Willful Defiance Recommended Position: Support Senate Bill 274 would remove disrupting school activities and willful defiance from being on the list of acts for which a pupil, regardless of their grade enrollment, may be suspended or recommended for expulsion. Additionally, this bill will remove the ability to suspend or expel pupils who are truant, tardy, or otherwise absent from school activities. DCYF would support this bill fully based on the research confirming students of color, homeless, with disabilities, in foster care, and/or LGBTQIA+ are more likely to be suspended for behavior deemed to be willfully defiant. 6 SB 287 (Skinner): Features that harm child users: civil penalty Recommended Position: Support Senate Bill 287 would prohibit social media platforms from using a design, algorithm, or feature that the platform knows, or with the exercise of reasonable care should have known causes child users increased risk of harm, including addiction to the social media platform. DCYF would fully support this bill fully because we recog nize that these algorithms can cause harm and increase risk in a number of ways, for example by promoting eating disorders or offering information on how to die by suicide. We also support that this bill lifts up the California Age -Appropriate Design Code Act which states that a business that provides an online service, product, or feature likely to be accessed by children to comply with specified requirements, including a requirement to configure all default privacy settings offered by the online service, product, or feature to the settings that offer a high level of privacy, as prescribed, and is required of a business. This requires new online services, products, or features that are offered to the public, complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment for any online service, product, or feature likely to be accessed by children and maintain documentation of this assessment if the online service, product, or feature is likely to be accessed by children. SB 333 (Cortese): Homeless Pupils: California Success , Opportunity, and Academic Resilience (SOAR) Guaranteed Income Program Recommended Position: Support Senate Bill 333 would require the State Department of Social Services to establish the California Success, Opportunity, and Academic Resilience (SOAR) Guaranteed Income Program. This program would award public school pupils who are in the 12th grade and are homeless children or youths, a guaranteed income of $1,000 each month for 5 months from April 1, 2025, to August 1, 2025. DCYF would support this bill fully based on the needs of who we would consider a priority population with greater needs, homeless youth, and because youth will receive a guaranteed based income of $1,000 for five months and funds would not be considered income for public social service programs or other purposes and would not negatively impact the award recipient's eligibility for future public social service programs. Department on the Status of Women Presenter: Alea Brown -Hoffmeister AB 254 (Bauer -Kahan): Confidentiality of Medical Information Act: reproductive or sexual health application information Recommended Position: Support Assemblymember Bauer -Kahan introduced AB 254 , which ensures the privacy and security of individuals' information when they opt to use apps and websites that provide reproductive and sexual health services. AB 576 (Weber): Medi- Cal: reimbursement for abortion Recommended Position: Support AB 576 ens ures that patients that rely on Medi-Cal can access medication abortion in line with up -to-date clinical guidelines and peer- reviewed scientific evidence. 7 AB 598 (Wicks): Sexual health education and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention educatio n: school climate and safety: California Healthy Kids Survey Recommended Position: Support AB 598, introduced by Assemblymember Wicks requires school districts, including those in the City and County of San Francisco, to participate in the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) and include a module on sexual and reproductive health care as one of the core survey modules. AB 710 (Schiavo): State Department of Public Health: pregnancy care and abortion services awareness campaign Recommended Position: Support This bill will launch a public information campaign to provide women with accurate information regarding access to abortion care at crisis pregnancy centers. AB 1194 (Carrillo): California Privacy Rights Act Of 2020: Exemptions: Abortion Services Recommended Position: Support This bill will ensure that businesses can not use exemptions under the Consumer Privacy Rights Act to share information about a consumer accessing, procuring, or searching for services regarding contraception, pregnancy care, and per inatal care, including abortion services. SB 36 (Skinner): Out-of-state criminal charges: prosecution related to abortion, contraception, reproductive care, and gender -affirming care Recommended Position: Support The new legislation by Senator Skinner builds on those landmark laws by barring California judges from directing bounty hunters or bail agents and making it illegal for bounty hunters and bail agents, to apprehend people who fled criminal prosecution or imprisonment for providing, receiving or supporting an abortion or gender- affirming care. Bounty hunters and bail agents who violate the new statute would be guilty of a misdemeanor and face up to a year in jail and forfeiture of their license to operate in California . SB 345 (Skinner): Health care services: legally protected health care activities Recommended Position: Support SB 345 expands legal protections for health care professionals providing reproductive health services as well as gender -affirming care, contraception, and abortions for out-of-state patients. Specifically, this bill will protect health care providers from suspension, license revocation, and other related disciplinary actions by a California medical licensing board, due to their performance of legally protected health car e services regardless of where these services were performed. Additionally, health care providers will be further protected from civil suits or criminal prosecution by non -California jurisdictions due to their performance of health care services, including abortions. 8 V.

Items are listed by Department, then by bill number. New Business San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Presenter: Katie Angotti ACA 1 (Aguiar- Curry): Local government financing: affordable housing and public infrastructure: voter approval Recommended Position: Support and seek amendment This measure would reduce the voter threshold from two -thirds to 55% for a city, county, or special district to approve a bond measure that funds the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of public infrastructure, affordable housing, or permanent supportive housing. SFMTA and the City has taken a support position on similar bills in the past. Public Comment: No Public Comment Motion to Support and Seek Amendments to ACA 1: Sarah Owens Seconded by: Preston Kilgore Approved: 7-0 AB 1221 (Chen): Parking Meters Recommended Position: Support This bill removes the provision in the Vehicle Code that prohibits local authorities from requiring payment of parking meters fees by a mobile device. If passed, local authorities may require payment of parking fees by a mobile device but are not required to. In practice, if this bill were to pass, cities can keep all of their parking meters, they could offer a combination of parking meters and pay by mobile device parking spots, or they can offer pay by mobile device only. Public Comment: No Public Comment Motion to Support A B 1221 : Eric Manke Seconded by: Luis 663 (Haney): Pharmacy: Mobile Units Recommended Position: Sponsor The recently passed SB 872 (Dodd) allows local jurisdictions to operate mobile 13 pharmacies that provides prescription medication within their city or county, including to persons experiencing homelessness, but does not allow any controlled substances to be dispensed from these mobile units. AB 663 would allow mobile pharmacies authorized under SB 872 to carry and dispense controlled substances used for the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Public Comment: No Public Comment Motion to S ponsor AB 663 : Sarah Owens Seconded prophylaxis Recommended Position: Support Senate Bill 339 will improve access to Pre -exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP ), the preventative HIV medication, by extending the length of time for which pharmacies may provide PrEP without a prescription, and by requiring health plans to cover the costs of pharmacists' time in preparing PrEP. Public Comment: No Public Comment Motion to Support SB 339 : Eric Manke Seconded by: Preston Kilgore Approved: 7-0 Department of Presenter: Kyle Wehner AB 660 (Irwin): Food Labeling: Quality Dates, Safety Dates, and Sell by Dates Recommended Position: Support AB 660 requires the use of clearer standards for food product labels, which have been voluntary for the past five years. These product labels include \"best if used by\" and \"best if used or frozen by\" to indicate the quality date of a product, and \"use by\" and \"use by or freeze by\" to indicate a product's safety. To reduce confusion resulting from labels intended for food retailers, AB 660 also prohibits the use of the term \"sell by\" in consumer labeling. Coded or machine readable \"sell by\" dates would remain available to retailers for inventory control. This bill would go into effect on January 1, 2025, and would provide a year for manufacturers to update their labels. The Environment Department is working to achieve the City and County of San Francisco's goal to cut food waste in half by 2030, and AB 660 would support this effort by helping to reduce household food waste. Public Comment: No Public Comment Motion to Support AB 660: Holly Lung Seconded by: Kelly Groth Approved: 7-0 Dobson AB 1352 (Bonta): Child care: statewide pilot policies: individualized county 14 childcare subsidy plans Recommended Position: Support Senate Bill 701 (Migden), passed on September 8, 2005, authorized the San Francisco Child Care Individualized County Subsidy Plan, a county child care subsidy plan specifically tailored to the needs and goals of the local early education community. The Individualized Child Care Subsidy Program (also known as the 'Pilot') was conceived as a means to explore solutions to the problems that the state's \"one -size-fits-all\" child care and development subsidy system presents, especially in higher cost counties. Without any additional funds allocated to the county, the Pilot seeks to demonstrate the effects of limited local control and flexibility in the administration of California Department of Education (CDE) and California Department of Social Services (CDSS) contracted funding and stakeholder efficiency to meet the goals of local increased family self -sufficiency, continuity of care for children and to stabilize a fragile early care and education infrastructure. San Francisco has utilized greater flexibility through the pilot program to meet local early education needs. Examples include 24 -month eligibility for child care/early education for eligible families, increased family income eligibility ceilings, the ability to facilitate funding transfers from under earning agencies to programs able to serve more children and over earn their contracts. San Mateo was another original Pilot county, and there are now eleven additional pilot counties, for a total of thirteen in the state. These counties have all received approval for the implementation of an individualized child care subsidy pilot. The majority of these pilots are due to sunset in June 2023, with the consequence being that counties will lose flexibility in the management of state child care and early education subsidy funds and the ability to request any further policy changes. Public Comment: No Pub lic Comment Motion to Support AB 1352 : Kelly Groth Seconded by: Preston Kilgore Approved: 7-0 Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector Presenter: Michelle Lau SB 474 (Becker): The Basic, Affordable Supplies for Incarcerated Californians (BASICs) Act Recommended Position: Support This bill alleviates cost pressures for incarcerated people and their families by eliminating price markups on items purchased in California's prison canteen stores. Public Comment: No Public Comment Motion to Support SB 474 : Eric Manke Seconded by: Kelly Groth Approved: AB 881 (Ting): Be The Jury CA Recommended Position: Support Be The Jury CA would raise juror pay in criminal cases from $15 to $100 per 15 day for low- to -moderate -income jurors. This bill would ensure that all Californians have access to a jury of their peers as promised by the U.S. Constitution. Public Comment: No Public Comment Motion to Table AB 881 : Sarah Owens Seconded by: Preston Kilgore Approved: 7-0 SB 343 (Skinner): Child Support Recommend ed Position: Support The bill would require the Department of Child Support Services and Judicial Council to conform with federal rule changes, resulting in improved capacity for non-custodial parents to pay their child support orders and maximize assistance to custodial parents and their children. Public Comment: No Public Comment Motion to Support SB 343 : Sarah Owens Seconded by: Eric Manke Approved: 7-0 AB 1186 (Bonta): The (Realizing Equity while Promoting Accountability and Impactful Relief) REPAIR Act Recommended Position: Support This bill will provide crime survivors with more equitable, timely, and stable compensation while setting youth who have caused harm on a more meaningful path towards accountability. Public Comment: No Public Comm ent Motion to Support AB 1186 : Eric Manke Seconded by: Preston Kilgore Approved: 7-0 San Francisco Human Services Agency Presenter: Susie Smith SB 408 (Ashby): Foster youth with complex needs Recommended Position: Support SB 408 would establish programs and services to support foster youth and youth at risk of foster care with significant trauma and complex needs. This investment is needed to ensure no youth are left behind in California's continuing effort to implement Continuum of Care Reform (CCR). Public Comment: No Public Comment Motion to Support SB 408 : Sarah Owens Seconded by: Holly Lung Approved: 7-0 V.

YES NO N/A AB 595 Asm. Essayi, District 63, Republican Animal shelters: 72-hour public notice: euthanasia: study Recommended Position SPONSOR SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended \u00d7OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB595, \"Bowie's Law\" Summary: The March 21 revisions require 72-hour public notice before the euthanasia of any animal except in cases of irremediable suffering, newborns without maternal care, and dogs with a documented history of vicious/dangerous behavior. It imposes criminal penalties for violations. The bill would create new requirements on Animal Care and Control agencies, and it is an unfunded mandate. Background/Analysis Existing law declares that it is the policy of the state that no adoptable animal should be euthanized if it can be adopted into a suitable home. Existing law also declares that it is the policy of the state that no treatable animal should be euthanized. As described above, this bill would impose a 72- hour notice requirement before euthanasia except in very specific circumstances, and would add requirements - including reporting requirements - to existing Animal Care and Control agencies. No funds for staff or programming are identified as part of this bill. Challenge San Francisco is an extremely successful shelter, sustaining a liv e release rate of more than 90% for dogs and cats since 2017. We take in roughly 10,000 animals annually. We assess the behavior and medical condition of every animal we receive to determine if it can be successfully adopted from our shelter. If our assessment shows that the animal needs more support than we can provide, we reach out to our network of more than 125 adoption partners. We receive animals who are dangerous and cannot safely be released to the public but there is no documented history of this behavior. In San Francisco, the average length of stay for dogs is approximately 10 days. For cats it's closer to 17 days. Adding a 72- hour hold period would further block a perilously full pipeline and exacerbate our overcrowding problem. 18 Solution/Recommended Proposal We recommend opposing this bill. There are no amendments that would improve the outcome for San Francisco. Departments Impacted & Why San Francisco Animal Care & Control Fiscal Impact In San Francisco at the SFACC, the average length of stay for dogs is approximately 10 days. For cats it's closer to 17 days. Adding a 72- hour hold period would further block a perilously full pipeline and exacerbate our overcrowding problem. Support / Opposition Teamsters and CalAnimals both opposed. 19State Legislation Committee Proposal Form This form should be used to submit legislative proposals for consideration by the State Legislation Committee.

Background/Analysis California has been a national leader in providing life -changing cash assistance for hard -working families through sma rt and targeted tax -credit programs. California's refundable tax credits, including CalEITC, Young Child Tax Credit, and Former Foster Youth Tax Credit increase economic well-being by putting more than $1 billion back into the pockets of millions of low -income Californians each year. They are also powerful tools for increasing racial equity in the state: 3 in 4 eligible Californians are people of color. The impact of these programs would be deepened by paying out tax credits monthly, as they're earned, instead of only once a year. In 2021, the federal government temporarily expanded the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and provided half of the credit as advance monthly payments over six months. Nearly 62 million children in 38 million families across the United States received financial relief, which was overwhelmingly used to pay for food, rent, child care, and other necessities for their children. Monthly CTC payments helped families pay bills, including to prevent utility shutoffs and evictions or foreclosures . They also reduced food insufficiency among families with kids by 24% and improvements were significant among Black and Latinx families, who experience the highest rates of food hardships. While the expansion of the federal CTC in 2021 drove an unprecedented 46% drop in child poverty, research from Columbia University shows monthly payments cut poverty by 30% more each month than the same amount made annually, because of their income stabilizing effects. 20 Challenge In California, 30% of households experience income volatility, and one in three Bay Area residents consistently run out of money before the end of each month, which makes it harder for families to pay bills, afford basics like groceries, or stay in their homes. Nationwide, income volatility disproportionately affects Black, Latinx, and families with low incomes, compounding the effects of institutional and systemic racism and furthering threatening the economic well- being of Californians of color. Income volatility threatens housing security. California faces a severe affordability crisis: over 75% of extremely low -income households are paying more than half of their income on rent each month. Unexpected financial crises (like a medical bill or job loss) are among the most common causes of homelessness, and recent research has even pinpointed the sharp dips in earnings and increased payday loan inquiries that precede evictions. Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 441 would increase income stability by pr oviding tax credits as advance payments on a monthly basis instead of as an annual lump sum, helping families more easily meet their needs as they come up throughout the year. AB 441 maximizes the impact of California's existing tax credit programs, which provide millions of dollars to low -income working people across the state every year. Homelessness prevention programs show that a cushion of even just a few hundred dollars a month can make the difference between staying housed or being evicted. That reliable monthly income can help households avoid evictions and their harmful effects, including less earnings and higher debt for years afterward. Monthly payments reduce income shocks and increase economic security. Monthly payments help families keep up with regular expenses, like food, housing and bills. Monthly payments reduce vulnerability to risky financial products like payday loans. Monthly payments help tax credits cut monthly poverty more than if paid in a lump sum. AB 441 would authorize the Franchise Tax Board to provide monthly payments to tax filers who are eligible for $1,000 or greater in combined tax credits from the CalEITC, young Child Tax Credit, and Foster Youth Tax Credit. This bill will Protect taxpayer s and the state from overpayments o Advance monthly payments will be equal to 80% of the estimated total credit amount; the other 20% of the credits will be available upon tax filing. Streamline the process for taxpayers o Payments will be paid by direct deposit where possible, or by check or debit card if not. o Recipients will have the ability to opt out of payments and make any changes affecting their eligibility for the credits on myFTB at any time. Protect taxpayers federal and state benefits o Advanced monthly payments will not be implemented until federal law is clear that monthly payments will not impact eligibility for federal benefits. o Franchise Tax Board will request any federal agency waivers that are necessary to protect taxpayers' federal means -tested benefits. 21 o Monthly payment of tax credits will not be counted as regular income for the purpose of determining any means -tested state benefits.

Caballero , District 14, Democrat Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities Housing Stability Act Recommended Position SPONSOR SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary SB 37 would establish a multi- year Rent Stabilization Fund to provide a mix of shallow and deep subsidies to help older adults and people with disabilities afford fair market rate rent and transition to permanent housing assistance programs, including federally funded subsidies like the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. SB 37 would also encourage the Department of Housing and Community Development to fund and work with a variety of community -based organizations who provide housing and services to older adults and people with disabilities. Background/Analysis Governor Newsom released California's Master Plan for Aging (MPA) in January 2021, calling on California to develop housing solutions to prevent and end homelessness among older adults and other at -risk populations. Two years later, the need for bold intervention to stop the surge of older adult homelessness is more urgent than ever. By investing state funds into a rental assistance program targeted to severely rent -burdened and other precariously housed older adults and persons with disabilities, we can keep people in the housing they already have, and get people into housing that meets their needs. A targeted rent stabilization program is the top housing recommendation of the MPA Impact Committee, DACLAC and was endorsed by more than 70 organizations that supported AB 2547 in the last legislative session. Challenge The rent affordability crisis is hitting older and disabled adults living on fixed incomes especially hard because they can't just work to make ends meet. Older Californians are facing sever housing cost burdens, with roughly 8 out of 10 extremely low -inco me older renters paying more than half of their income for rent. Caught in the vice between inadequate income and rapidly rising rents, older adults have become the fastest growing age group experiencing homelessness in California, with 45% of California's homeless individuals now age 50 and older, many of whom have become unhoused for the first time after age 50. Over 56,000 Californians age 55 and older accessed homeless services in2 021. People with disabilities, who are far more likely to live in pov erty, make up about 43% of those experiencing homelessness. This risk of homelessness particularly impacts 23 African American/Black households, who are over five times more likely to become homeless than Californians as a whole. Solution/Recommended Propos al Create a targeted housing stabilization program that will prevent and solve homelessness for many of thousands of older adult and people living with disabilities through the following unique approach: Through a competitive grant process administered by the Housing and Community Development Department, fund housing subsidies that meet the specific needs of eligible households. Targeting prevention resources to those most at risk of homelessness using evidence - informed predictive factors. Ensuring that people receiving subsidies through this program will eventually transition to longer -term federally -funded subsidies through preference in federal turn -over vouchers. Leverage funding strategies that have worked locally, such as partnering with landlords, public housing authorities, local aging and disability providers, and area agencies on aging. Ensuring that the allocation of funds represents geographic diversity and promotes equity. Departments Impacted & Why Department of Homelessness & Supportive Housing that provides housing interventions to prevent and end homelessness and additional resources are needed for this population. Department of Disability and Aging Services that provides support services to the population who would be served by this gra nt program. San Francisco Housing Authority that administers federal permanent housing subsidies like Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. Fiscal Impact Provide a new source of funding for much needed rental subsidies for this population. Would likely require the City to fund the support serves needed to ensure program participants can be successful in the rental subsidies. Administrative and implementation costs to HSH and/or DAS.

Background/Analysis Governor Newsom released California's Master Plan for Aging (MPA) in January 2021, calling on California to develop housing solutions to prevent and end homelessness among older adults and other at -risk populations. SB -657 is one of the 11 bills that Justice in Aging has identified as furthering the Master Plan for Agency's goal this legislative session. This bill add language to Section 8257.25 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, relating to homelessness, that currently establishes: The California Department of Aging in the California Health and Human Services agency and requires the Department to designate and work with area agencies on aging to work for the interest of older Californians; Establishes that federally defined continuums of care are eligible for specified State grants and programs; Required the creation of the Interagency Council on Homelessness for specific purposes, including to create partnerships among various entities. Challenge Caught in the vice between inadequate income and rapidly rising rents, older adults have become the fastest growing age group experiencing homelessness in California, with 45% of 25 California's homeless individuals now age 50 and older, many of whom have become unhoused for the first time after age 50. Over 56,000 Californians age 55 and older accessed homeless services in 2021. This risk of homelessness particularly impacts African American/Black households, who are over five times more likely to become homeless than Californians as a whole. Solution/Rec ommended Proposal Homeless services staff, especially those working in shelter and prevention services are an important component in addressing California's homelessness crisis, yet the majority of the supportive staff are not trained in the issues and concerns of older adults. Staff training on older adult issues, how to access an individual's independence to manage daily living activities, and knowledge of regional services and resources is needed to better assist a more vulnerable population experien cing homelessness. By requiring the Interagency Council on Homelessness and regional Continuums of Care (CoC's) to create and provide geriatric training to homeless service staff, staff will be better prepared to support the unique needs of older adults experiencing homelessness. Departments Impacted & Why Department of Homelessness & Supportive Housing funds homeless services in San Francisco and has the Local Homelessness Coordinating Board (LHCB), San Franciso's Continuum of Care as an advising body. Department of Disability and Aging Services in the Human Services Agency has partnerships with HSH to support older adults experiencing homelessness and works closely with area agencies on aging. Fiscal Impact The bill would be implemented contingent on an appropriation for those purposes in the budget act.

Schiavo, District 40, Democrat Medi -Cal: Comprehensive Perinatal Services Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 608 ensures more Californian s have a healthy start to life by extending the C omprehensive Perinatal Services Program for Medi -Cal members to one year postpartum . The bill also allows perinatal health workers to provide preventive services outside of a clinic . Background/Analysis In San Francisco , a persistent and consistent pattern emerges when examining birth data by race and ethnicity. Socio -economic hardships, pregnancy complications and barriers to prenatal care remain significantly higher for Black/African American and Pacific Islander women, despite small improvements over the past decade. For example, Black/African American (22%) birthing people were significantly more likely to report prenatal depression than White (9%) birthing people. One of the programs provided under Medi- Cal t hat aims to address these inequities, and improve overall birth and post -partum outcomes, is the Comprehensive Perinatal Services Program (CPSP). The CPSP is a program under Medi- Cal that provides a wide range of culturally competent services to pregnant people, from conception to 60 days after delivery. In addition to standard obstetric services, women receive enhanced services in the areas of nutrition, psychosocial, and health education. These services are provided in clinical settings by multidisciplinary team s that also include Comprehensive Perinatal Health Workers (CPHW). In San Francisco, there are 16 providers who provide services under the program, and in 2021, 1,500 births were covered under Medi -Cal. Challenge Comprehensive health and social services, especially when provided by CPHW s, are important for promot ing primary prevention of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). ACEs are potentially traumatic events that occur while we are young. A significant body of research has shown that the more ACEs one is exposed to as a child, the greater one's health risks are as an adult. The primary prevention strategy for ACEs is to address the source by creating a stable, safe, and nurturing relationships and environments for children, starting before birth. Perinatal health 27 workers such as CPHWs help screen for behavioral and physical health issues, promote preventive healthcare, and support stronger parent -child bonds. While current law provides full- scope Medi -Cal benefits for pregnant individuals for a full calendar year after birth, it does not include perinatal services, which are covered only 60 -days post pregnancy. A 2020 Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) report found only one in four children covered by Medi -Cal received developmental screenings or child well visits in the first 15 months. Given that many ACEs and negative impacts of postpartum depression may not manifest until well after childbirth, the 60- day window of CPSP leaves a gap in support that can significantly impact a child's development and future. Further, perinatal health workers are restricted to providing services only within clinics, and therefor e are not able meet individuals where they reside and feel most comfortable receiving care. These factors can collectively work to prevent pregnant and post -partum persons from receiving important health and social services. Solution/ Recommended Proposal AB 608 would expand the Comprehensive Perinatal Services Program by: Requiring Medi -Cal to cover Comprehensive Perinatal Services for the full calendar year following pregnancy. Requiring DHCS to seek federal approval for coverage of in -home visits of perinatal health workers to beneficiaries of CPSP. By expanding the duration and location that CPSP services can be provided and covered under Medi -Cal, this bill would allow San Francisco's CPSP providers to better support the needs of pregnant and postpartum people , such as mental health care , lactation support, parenting support and other social determinant of health needs that occur during the 365 days post pregnancy . Further, a llowing CPSP services to be provided in -home by perinatal health workers would provide additional support to pregnant and postpartum people who participate in public health nurse home visiting programs. The addition of CPHWs to home visiting teams will expand the current limited workforce and provide support for referral assessments to programs before issues in home es calate . Departments Impacted & Why DPH will have to: (1) provide training and technical assistance to CPSP providers on administering the new benefits to patients. (2) p rovide training & technical assistance to programs that will be working with perinatal health workers for in- home CPSP services. Fiscal Impact This bill will allow CPSP providers (in DPH and outside of DPH) to receive additional revenue for providing services for the duration of the 12 -month extension.

Weber , District 79, Democrat California Home Visiting Program Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary The California Home Visiting Program (CHVP) is a voluntary program created by the State Department of Public Health to support pregnant people and parents with young children who live in communities that face greater risks and barriers to achieving positive maternal and child health outcomes. AB 105 7 would boost the reach and impact of CHVP by giving additional flexibility to local health jurisdictions to administer Home Visiting Programs that address the unique needs of their communities and better provide support to families who need it most. Background/Analysis In San Francisco , a persistent and consistent pattern emerges when examining birth data by race and ethnicity. Socio -economic hardships, pregnancy complications, and barriers to prenatal care remain significantly higher for Black/African American and Pacific Islander women despite small improvements over the past decade. For example, Black/African American birthing people were significantly more likely to report prenatal depression (22%) than white birthing people (9%). The California Home Visiting Program (CHVP) aims to address these disparities by supporting pregnant people and parents with young children who live in communities that face greater risks and barriers to achieving positive maternal and child health outcome s. CHVP is designed to support preventative intervention s by focusing on positive parenting and child development for families who are at risk for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as neglect, abuse, child maltreatment, mental health related issues, or other potentially traumatic experiences. San Francisco Department of Public Health's Maternal Child Adolescent Health Division oversees one of the county's local CHVP programs , the Nurse -Family Partnership (NFP) Program. The NFP program is for women who are pregnant with their first child who enroll in their first or second trimester (less than 28 weeks) . The program provides nursing care in client homes and in the community , through the child's second birthday . Additionally, San Francisco, in collaboration with Napa and Sonoma Counties , has launched a new program funded by a CHVP grant, Trauma Informed A pproach in Public Health Nursing (TIA -PHN). TIA -PHN is based on ACEs 29 research and trauma informed principles, and aims to incorpo rate a trauma- informed approach into traditional maternal and child home visiting programs for clients who do not have access to or do not meet NFP criteria . This program launched in 2021, and funding has been extended through FY 2026 Public health nurses (PHNs) in th ese programs buil d therapeutic relationships with clients who have experienced trauma and/or have underlying physical and mental health challenges. These programs provide physical assessment, linkages to medical, dental, behavioral health, and community resources, education regarding childbirth, parenting, safety in the home and community, nutrition, maternal role development, child development, and more. Because the home visitors are nurses, they are uniquely able to support clients with complex needs and provide both physical assessment as well as referrals, linkages and emotional support. Challenge Maternal mental health disorders (MMHDs) are the most common complication during the perinatal period, which often goes both u ndetected and untreated. MMHDs are even more prevalent for birthing people of color with rates that are often as high as 20 percent for African American and Latino women. These high rates are often attributed to a lack of awareness and stigma of mental health issues within their respective communities, higher levels of stress, and other socio- economic factors. Currently, mental health support can be difficult to access for our clients, and our programs have record long waitlists with PHNs unable to serve all the need. Further, state rules limit the type s of home visiting models counties can implement to address these needs . Solution/ Recommended Proposal AB 1057 would require the California Department of Public Health to allow local health departments (LHDs) additional flexibility in administering the California Home Visiting Program (CHVP). Specifically this bill would: Allow local health departments the flexibility to use any other federally approve d home visiting model. Permit local health departments the opportunity to supplement home visiting with mental health supports and training. Allow local health jurisdictions to submit an alternative public health nursing model that prioritizes the unique needs of individuals in that jurisdiction (e.g., Trauma Informed A pproach in PHN ). Mental health needs are high for our client s, those who care for them, and our PHN staff. This bill would allow our PHN home visiting programs to embed mental health clinicians to provide direct therapy via home visits to clients who are unable to obtain or access other community resources . These same clinicians would also carry a caseload of PHNs for whom they would provide mental health support given the secondary trauma impacts they experience. SFDPH h as piloted the provision of mental health consultation for PHNs for the last 5 years which has increased staff resilience and team morale, has improved the ability of our PHNs to provide therapeutic support for clients, and has decreased burnout. Further, this bill would allow the current pilot program to continue after the initial three- year grant , by expanding the allowable public health nursing models that local jurisdictions can implement on a non -pilot basis. Departments Impacted & Why No other departments would be impacted. 30 Fiscal Impact California u ses federal and general fund to operate the CHVP .

Rubio , District 22, Democrat End the Debt Trap Act Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would eliminate the collection and accrual of interest on child support debt owed to the government for public assistance repayment . Background/Analysis For over 40 years, California has required parents who receive public assistance to repay the state by intercepting their child support payments . When parents cannot afford to pay, their debt to the state grows rapidly because of California 's high interest rates on child support debt t o the government. California's 10% interest rate is one of the highest in the country, with only seven other states joining California in charging 10% or more. Meanwhile, s ixteen states -including Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolin a, South Dakota, and Utah- charge no interest at all . California's interest rate - higher than in Mississippi and Texas - quickly inflates debt to levels that are nearly impossible to repay. In California, a parent with $15,000 in debt, the average amount owed, could pay $50 every two weeks for 30 years and they'd actually owe more than when they started, since the interest owed exceeds their annual payments. Someone making the same payments in 1 of the 16 states that charge no interest would have nearly paid off their debt in 12 years. As a result, today low -income parents owe over $6.5 billion in unpaid child support debt to the state. While Governor Newsom and the Legislature have committed to ending the state interception of child support to repay public benefits by 2025, parents who are already in debt , and who have accrued substantial interest on this debt, require debt relief due to this unjust and inequitable public assistance repayment practice, which is fueled by this extreme interest rate. Challenge California 's 10% interest on government -owed debt traps low -income parents in insurmountable debt. The State's own research shows that 95% percent of child support debt owed to the government is uncollectible since it is owed by very low -income parents who simply cannot pay 32 it. Many of these parents are elderly or disabled, living only on Social Security. Eliminating the interest rate is also a crucial racial and economic equity issue we must address because child support debt disproportionately impacts families of color. By imposing 10% interest on government owed debt, California undermines the economic stability of low -income families, increases the debt to unsustainable levels, and exacerbates racial inequity and the racial wealth gap. It also furthers a legacy of extracting wealth from Black families, which is why the state's reparations task force recommends eliminating the annual interest rate charged for past due child support. Solution/ Recommended Proposal Eliminating the collection and ac crual of interest rate on child support debt owed to the government will build on groundbreaking reforms brought by Governor Newsom and the California Legislature . Because federal law does not require that interest be charged on government- owed child support debt, California can end the collection and accrual of interest without federal action. This action will free up low -income parents' ability to support themselves and their children. This bill would not impact the child support debt or inter est rate that is owed to the custodial parent. Departments Impacted & Why No impact to City and County of San Francisco departments.

Petrie -Norris, District 73, Democrat County human services agencies: workforce development Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 366 by Assembly Member Petrie -Norris would provide funding and resources, as well as reduce barriers, to address significant workforce shortages in county human services programs. Background/Analysis County human service agencies are facing critical staffing shortages across all program areas. Competition for staff is fierce both within the county (across programs and services as well as the private sector) and across county lines. Rapid turnover of county staff undermines the quality of services provided to consumers of county programs, impedes progress for improving county practices, and potentially can result in fiscal sanctions in some situations (i.e. federal Child and Family Service Reviews in CWS). Last year, after strong advocacy by CWDA and our co -sponsor NASW, the State Budget provided $30 million General Fund to expand slots in schools of social work to increase the pool of Master's level social workers. While this is a necessary first step, there will be several years before the new MSW's enter the workforce, and this aspect of staffing needs only accounts f for part of the county -level staffing shortages. Solution/Recommended Proposal For counties that use the state -administered Merit System for job applicants (not SF), require that Merit use alternate minimum qualifications for any county that has a 20% or greater vacancy rate. Establish a \"Building Diversity in Human Service Workforc e Program\" as an opt -in grant program administered by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS). This would be a two -year program and priority would be given to counties that demonstrate a commitment to building diversity in their programs by recruiting and supporting persons from underserved and/or over- represented communities. The grant program will help 34fund county programs for three potential tracks: o High school to career track o College to career track to Community to career track. Estimate d costs: $30 million Require CDSS to work with counties and the California Social Work Education Center (CalSWEC), to establish a Title IV -E stipend program in rural counties for community college students who have an interest in public child welfare work. This will allow the state and counties to leverage the 75 percent federal match for training leading to state or local agency employment, which is not limited to pursuit of a bachelor's or master's level education.

Nguyen, District 10, Democrat California Right to Financial Privacy Act Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would improve the capability of Adult Protective Services (APS) to fulfill its obligation to protect seniors and disabled adults from the growing threat of financial abuse. Background/Analysis County APS Departments are responsible for investigating alleged incidences of abuse of older and dependent adults, including financial abuse. This role is expanding with the population that APS serves, which has grown and changed significantly since the program's inception. By 2030, one in five Californians will be age 65 or older \u2014 double what the over -65 population is today. Many of these individuals will also be disabled, cognitively impaired, or facing housing instability. County APS programs struggle to address an evolving landscape of abuse and neglect, including an increase of financial abuse and scams targeting this growing population. As of 2021, California ranks first nationally in total monetary losses, and third in per -capita monetary losses, ex perienced by victims of elder financial abuse. 1 County APS investigators are granted access to certain financial records of an alleged victim under current law. However, a law enforcement agency, district attorney or special agent of the Department of Just ice must first certify that a crime report has been filed before APS can access the information of a potential victim of abuse. This typically requires APS, once notified of alleged financial abuse from a mandated reporter, to file a police report prior to submitting a request to a bank or financial institution for access to an individual's financial records Challenge The requirement to file a police report to access records that are necessary to substantiate reports of financial abuse is a barrier to APS in conducting an effective investigation. Even when 1 2021 DOJ Elder Fraud Report: https://www.justice.gov/file/1523276/download 36 APS has reasonable suspicion of abuse, a police report must first be filed to proceed further with the investigation. This requirement makes it more difficult to protect older and dependent adults in a timely manner. No comparable requirement exists for the other types of abuse APS is tasked with investigating. Count y APS investigators experience further restrictions that impede their ability to protect victims. Once an APS investigator has been granted access, they are restricted to only financial records dating from a period of 30 days before and after the date of a ny alleged illegal activity (60 days total). Limiting access to such a narrow window of time makes it significantly harder for APS to identify normal spending habits of the alleged victim, which is necessary to identify abnormal and potentially illegal act ivity. Additionally, APS is severely limited in the types of financial information that they can access. APS is excluded from accessing information that counties have identified as potentially critical to uncovering financial abuse and scams. This includes information related to newly issued cards, changes of addresses and information regarding trusts or Power of Attorney. Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 386 is intended to address the challenges posed by these tight restrictions. This bill will assist APS in effectively investigating allegations of abuse by: 1) amending the law to allow an APS report of abuse to suffice as a certification that a crime report has been filed that involves financial abuse; 2) extending the period for which APS can request records to 90 days prior and 90 days following the alleged illegal act, and; 3) expanding the types of items APS can request from a bank or financial institution to include information regarding newly issued cards, changes of addresses and information rega rding trusts or Power of Attorney. The changes included in this bill will better ensure that APS is able to meet the needs of the growing population of older and dependent adults and uncover incidences of financial abuse. In better protecting victims from identity theft and abuse, this bill ultimately improves victims' privacy from those who would do them harm.

Arambula, District 31, Democrat CalFresh Fruit and Vegetable Supplemental Benefits Expansion Program Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 605 (Arambula) would expand the number and geographic diversity of retailers offering fruit and vegetable supplemental benefits to CalFresh. Background/Analysis This February, the California Department of Social Services went live with the CalFresh Fruit and Vegetable EBT Pilot Program1, which provides CalFresh households with up to $60/month in additional food assistance when they buy California -grown fresh fruits and vegetables with their EBT cards. Because this program is integrated into the state's EBT system, it is poised to scale at more retail locations and reach many more people quickly. This comes at an important time: more than five million CalFresh participants are facing a hunger cliff - due to both high food inflation and a drop in their benefits because of the end of federal \"emergency allotments.\" Since March 2020, all CalFresh recipients have received the maximum CalFresh benefit available for their household size, regardless of other income (e.g. earnings, SS I, etc.). The policy also set a minimum monthly benefit amount of $95 per month. Beginning in this month, individuals and families on CalFresh are no longer receiving this extra monthly payment; in addition, the minimum benefit level will return to $23 per month. As we shared in a memo to the Board, HSA estimates that approximately 70,000 CalFresh households \u2014 more than 96,000 San Franciscans \u2014 will lose a total $11.5M per month. The average decrease in CalFresh will be $160/month; San Francisco individuals and families on CalFresh will lose between $95 1 https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/13/Press%20Releases/2023/CDSS- -Veg-EBT -Pilot -Project.pdf 38 and $517 per month. The neighborhoods with the largest share of CalFresh recipients are the Tenderloin, Excelsior, Bayview Hunters Point, and Visitacion Valley. This February, the California Department of Social Services went live with the CalFresh Fruit and Vegetable EBT Pilot Program2, which provides CalFresh households with up to $60/month in additional food assistance when they buy California -grown fresh fruits and vegetables with their EBT cards. Because this program is integrated into the state's EBT system, it is poised to scale at more retail locations and reach many more people quickly - and could help blunt some of the pain of the benefits cliff. However, the pilot is slated to end and run out of funds this December, without legislative and budgetary action. In addition to helping reduce hunger, Fruit and Vegetable Supplemental Benefits also benefit California farmers who grow the vast majority of produce sold in grocery stores (and all the prod uce sold at certified California farmers' markets). Challenge Even before the pandemic and soaring food costs, one in four San Franciscans were at risk of hunger. The inflationary pressures and the ongoing fallout of the recession particularly among the lowest income residents has only exacerbated this crisis. San Francisco residents are not alone. Californians with low income across the state can't make ends meet. As of early 2022, one of every ten adults in California reported that they struggled to consistently put enough food on their table. 3 This very high rate of food insecurity exists even with the CalFresh program providing food assistance to between 4 -5 million Californians.4 According to a recent statewide survey , three in four Californians with low or moderate income worried about running out of food in the past year. And three in five actually did run out of food. 5 Research demonstrates that current CalFresh benefits alone do not provide enough money for families to meet the USDA's nutrition and dietary guidelines for fruits and vegetables. 6 Federal SNAP emergency allotments have provided, in total, $500 million dollars in food assistance each month to Californians. That translates into an average drop in CalFresh benefits of roughly $200/month per household 7. CalFresh households' purchasing patterns often don't reflect the foods they need, want, or find culturally appropriate. Shopping decisions are shaped mostly by high prices and limited access, which restricts their choices. 8 2 https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/13/Press%20Releases/2023/CDSS- News -release- California -Fruit -Veg-EBT -Pilot -Project.pdf 3 US Census Bureau, Household Pulse Survey, \"Food Scarcity - Week 41 (December 29, 2021 - January 10, 2022)\":https://www.census.gov/data- tools/demo/hhp/#/?measures=FOODSCARCE&periodSelector=41&s_state=00006 4 CalFresh Data Dashboard, CalFresh Persons - Mont hly Participation (as Nov 2021): https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/data - portal/research al., \"The Affordability of MyPlate: An Analysis of SNAP Benefits and the Actual Cost of Eating According to the DietaryGuidelines\", Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, V ol. 49, Issue 8 (September 2017), 623 - 631. 7 Kuang, Jeanne. \"'No Light at the Other End': Impending Loss of Pandemic CalFresh Boosts Could Trigger Hunger Spike.\" CalMatters, February 9, 2023. https://calmatters.org/california -divide/2023/02/calfresh- emergency -allotments -ending/ . 8 Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \"More Adequate SNAP Benefits Would Help Millions of Participants Better Food,\" July2021: https://www.cbpp.org/research/food- assistance/more -adequate- snap-benefits-would- help- millions -of-participants- better 39 Among Californians with low income, 29 percent report that they can only sometimes find affordable fruits and vegetables in their neighborhood and 3 percent report they never can.9 Enforcing payment of child support by parents who are financially struggling generally serves to make reunification with their children harder to achieve and can further destabilize the family. Research shows that for every $100 child welfare- involved parents pay, their child's duration in care lengthens for 6.6 months. The effects are especially pronounced for families of color, who are significantly over - represented in California's child welfare system. Solution/Recommended Proposal Expanding CalFresh Fruit and Vegetable Supplemental Benefits to be available to hundreds of thousands of households across the state will, in the short -term, help families aff ord the foods they need to stay healthy and help alleviate some of the economic strain they are facing with SNAP emergency allotments ending. In the long -term, it will position the program to become permanently available to CalFresh families throughout California. Research shows that existing, similar programs - including Double Up Food Bucks, M\u00e1s Fresco, Market Match, and others - reduce hunger, improve health, and increase revenue for agricultural communities. 10 It is a \"win- win-win\" that reduces hunger, improves public health, and boosts California's agricultural economy. Departments Impacted & Why N/A Fiscal Impact There is an accompanying budget proposal to request a one -time allocation of $93.75 million to be spent over 2 years. The funds would be used by the state to: 1. Expand the program to 1 -2 large grocery chains with broad geographic reach in California. 2. Expand the program to additional smaller independently owned and operated grocery stores and chains. 3. Expand the program to additional farmers' m arkets and other farm -direct sites. 4. Contract with one or more firms to develop at least two technology solutions to make it easier for farmers markets and corner stores to offer supplemental benefits. 96% of the funds requested in this proposal will go directly into the pockets of CalFresh participants to buy food.

Ward, D istrict 78, Democrat Vehicles: video imaging of bicycle lane parking violations Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill authorizes a local agency to use automated forward- facing parking control devices on city owned enforcement vehicles to cite vehicles parked in a bike lane. Background/Analysis From 2017 through 2021 there have been approximately 2,000 bicycle collisions involving vehicles in San Francisco and between 1 and 3 lives lost each year over that same period. SFMTA's vision is to make bicycling a part of everyday life and underpinning this vision are four key goals: 1. Improve the safety and connectivity of San Francisco's Bike Network 2. Make bicycling a more convenient transportation option through amenities like better bike parking and an expanded bike sharing system 3. Use outreach and education to increase bicycle ridership, especially in underserved populations 4. Plan and deliver projects that make bicycling, and other non -private auto modes, the preferred way of getting around Bike lanes provide a dedicated space for cyclists that make cyclists feel safe. As of May 2022, San Francisco installed 463.7 miles of bike lanes and 121 protected miles. While counted bike volumes dropped substantially in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID, counted bike volumes in 2022 are the highest since 2019. SFMTA invests significant resources to plan and implement bike lanes in order to increase cyclis t safety. When a motorist parks in the bike lane, it undermines this work and creates a dangerous environment for cyclists, causing them to s werve into the traffic lane. Challenge Currently, the only tool cities have to discourage drivers from stopping in bike lanes are tickets issued by our parking control officers. In order for parking control officers to issue a ticket, they must witness the 41 offense, approach the vehicle in violation to record the vehicle's VIN number and affix the citation onto the vehicle. There are many instances of parking in bikes lanes in San Francisco on any given day and the SFMTA has a limited number of parking control officers. Issuing this kind of ticket takes time due the requirement for the ticket to include the violating vehicle's VIN and to attach it to the vehicle. This limits the parking control officer's ability to issue more citations. Further, the driver of the vehicle in violation may be waiting in the parked car and drive away if they see a parking control officer 's vehicle. Finally, there are instances of parking control officers being assaulted while issuing a ticket. Solution/Recommended Proposal This bill would authorize cities to use existing technology to make it easier and safer to enforce parking in bike lane violations. Similar to the forward- facing cameras that SFMTA uses to enforce violations of stopping in a transit only lane, this bill would allow cities to install forwar d-facing cameras onto city owned enforcement vehicles to capture violations of parking in bike lanes. This bill would allow cities to review those images and sen d a violation in the mail. By removing the requirement to affix the ticket on the vehicle and record the vehicle VIN number, SFMTA parking control officers would be able to issue more tickets for parking in a bike lane which would disincentivize this dangerous driving behavior. In addition, SFMTA's parking control officers would be less exposed to potent ial assaults since they can remain in their vehicle when recording a violation. The bill authorizes a pilot program until Jan 1, 2030 . The devices would only capture parking violations and not capture images of other streets users. T he bill requires the local agency to include in their program options to reduce or waive the payment of a parking penalty for indigent persons. Only warning notices can be issue d for the first 60 days of the program and the agency must make a public announcement and provide the public with information about the program before it begins . A designated employee of the local agency must review the video images to determine whether a parking violation occu rred. Tickets are civil penalties and the bill provides for a process to contest the ticket. For privacy purposes, the bill limits the public's right of access to the images captured by an automated parking control device installed on city -owned or district -owned parking enforcement vehicles. Local agencies that implement such a program must provide to the transportation, privacy, and judiciary committees of the Legislature an evaluation report of the enforcement system's effectiveness, impact on privacy, impact on traffic outcomes, cost to imp lement, change in citations issued, and generation of revenue, no later than December 31, 2029. Departments Impacted & Why SFMTA would be the only department impacted. Fiscal Impact This bill does not require local agencies to do anything. However, if passed and SFMTA choose s to install cameras for bike lane enforcement, the SFMTA would pay for the camera equipment and processing fees.

Min, District 37, Democrat Transit operators: street harassment survey Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill requires the top ten public transit operators, including the SFMTA, upon appropriation of funds by the Legislature to collect and publish survey data and conduct outreach activities for the purpose of informing their efforts to improve the safety of riders and reduce street harassment on public transit. The bill requires transit operators, by December 31, 2024, to publish the survey data on their websites and inform the Governor and the Legis lature. Background/Analysis Last year, the Legislature approved SB 1161 (Min, Chapter 318, Statutes of 2022), which requires the Mineta Transportation Institute (MTI) to develop a standard survey for transit operators to use to gather data related to str eet harassment. The survey includes specific demographic information and information regarding a riders' experiences with safety while waiting at transit stops and riding the transit system. SB 434 takes the next step by requiring the top 10 transit operat ors in the state, by December 31, 2024, to gather and publish data about riders and their experiences with street harassment on their systems. As part of the survey process, operators would be required to conduct outreach activities with specific subpopulations of riders who are traditionally underrepresented, such as women, non - English speakers, LGBTQ+, and people with disabilities. Transit operators would be able to utilize the survey developed by MTI, add additional questions or use their own survey. This bill is very much in line with work that is currently underway by the SFMTA's Safety Equity Initiative. The aim of the Safety Equity Initiative is to reduce and eventually eliminate gender -based harassment and violence on SFMTA's Muni lines. As part of the initiative, the SFMTA has expanded the ways in which people can report gender -based harassment incidents to help us understand the scope of the problem better, identify possible improvements and track progress. 43 Additionally, if a transit operator has collected the data or conducted the outreach activities required by the bill in the last five years, they are deemed to have met the requirements of the bill. This takes into account the work of systems like SFMTA. Finally, transit operators would be required to publish on their website all survey data collected, expect any personally identifiable data. They must also inform the Governor and the Legislature when the data is published. Challenge California's public transit systems provide a crucial service to local communities. Unfortunately, studies show that many women (trans and cisgender) and other vulnerable communities experience harassment while using these services. Women and other vulnerable communities are often unable to access public transit safely due to street harassment, which can include unwanted sexual and racialized comments and slurs, whistling, leering, and other intimidating actions. According to a 2019 statewide study by the University of California San Diego Center on Gender Equity and Health, 77 percent of women experience sexual harassment in a public space, including 29 percent on mass transit. Solution/Recommended Proposal SB 434 seeks to increase safety for public transit riders by requirin g the 10 largest transit providers to collect and publish survey data on demographic information and information regarding a riders' experiences with safety while waiting at transit stops and riding the transit system, and conduct outreach activities with subpopulations of riders who are underrepresented in surveys and impacted by street harassment. The bill requires transit operators, by December 31, 2024, to publish the survey data on their websites and inform the Governor and the Legislature.

Wiener, District 11, Democrat Public utilities: electrical distribution grid: interconnection Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would require electrical corporations to interconnect development projects to the electrical distribution grid within eight weeks of a project receiving a \"Green Tag\" from a governmental agency. Issuance of a Green Tag would confirm that all prerequisite work and approvals necessary for interconnection of a development project to the grid have been completed and received by the project applicant. The bill would require electrical corporations to compensate project applicants in the event th at the electrical corporation fails to interconnect the project to the grid within the eight week timeline. The bill would also require electrical corporations to provide an annual report to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on the number of interconnection applications received within the previous 12 months and the time period for interconnecting these projects to the gr id. The SFPUC recommends a support position for SB 83. Background/Analysis The investor -owned utilities' (IOUs) conduct distribution grid planning with considerations for customer load interconnections in the context of general rate cases, where distribution investments for traditional maintenance, service area expansion, reliability, resiliency, and safety are proposed by the IOUs and authorized by the CPUC . The IOUs' distribution grid planning to support distributed energy resource expansion occurs in the High Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Future Grid proceeding, R.21-06-017. The existing policy concerning electric grid upgrades due to increased new and permanent customer load is set forth in two Electric Tariff Rules - Rule 15 (Distribution Line Extensions) and Rule 16 (Service Line Extensions). Tariff Rule 15 generally pertains to grid equipment used by multiple customers (e.g. a transformer serving multiple homes). Rule 16 generally pertains to network equipment used by only one customer. Currently, there is no public interconnection queue for applications under the Wholesale Access Distribution Tariff (WDT), Rule 15, and Rule 16, nor are the IOUs held to any timelines to interconnect these customers . 46 Challenge Retail and wholesale customers have experienced long service extension interconnection delays, arbitrary requests for additional and/or unnecessary information, and/or increased project costs due to equipment upgrades dictated by IOUs. Load interconnection delays continue to h ave significant repercussions for California residents and businesses. For example, affordable housing, medical facilities, and public projects have been especially vulnerable to load interconnection delays. Solution/ Recommended Proposal The SFPUC recomme nds a support position for SB 83. Departments Impacted & Why This bill would help mitigate delays experienced by City projects attempting to interconnect to PG&E's electrical distribution grid in San Francisco. The SFPUC operates San Francisco's publicly - owned utility for electric service, Hetch Hetchy Power. Wholesale customers with applications to receive electric service from Hetch Hetchy Power must rely on PG&E's wholesale transmission and distribution services per PG&E's tariffs, which are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Since FERC has no set requirements for its regulated entities to make interconnection queues public, the SFPUC has little visibility as to where its new customer s' applications stand in PG&E's interconnection queue. PG&E also lacks set timelines for key portions of the interconnection process which can lead to significant or indefinite delays. Since October 2018, the SFPUC has provided quarterly reports to the Board of Supervisors which have identified 136 projects , including a combined 519 units of affordable housing, that have experienced delays. Fiscal Impact The total cost impact (i.e. additional project costs and loss of revenue to the City of San Francisco) of the interconnection delays reported to the Board of Supervisors since October 2018 is over $28 million.1 Support / Opposition N/A- Bill analysis is currently pending . 1 San Francisco Public Utilities Commission's Quarterly Report to the Board of Supervisors on the Status of Applications to PG&E for Electric Service.

Ochoa Bogh , District 23, Republican Excavations: subsurface installations Recommended Position SPONSOR SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE X OPPOSE unless AMENDED Summary This bill would remove the exemption for non pressurized sewer lines and storm drains from California's Dig Safe Law. It also makes other changes, such as revising requirements around notification of operators, use of vacuum equipment, and processes regarding discrepancies in excavation area delineation. The SFPUC recommends an oppose unless amended position for SB 778. Background/Analysis The Dig Safe Law of 2016 regulates excavations around underground infrastructure, including pipelines, conduits, ducts, wires, and other structures (except nonpressurized sewer lines and storm drains). Under this law, excavators must comply with requirements to properly mark the area to be excavated (delineation) and notify appropriate regional notification centers and opera tors of subsurface installations. The SFPUC's Wastewater Enterprise currently complies with this law by marking its pressurized sewage pipelines, structures, electrical conduits and ductbanks, and chemical and hydraulic lines related to the sewer systems. Challenge Our primary concern with the bill is the removal of the exemption for nonpressurized lines and storm drains. The current practice of not marking non pressurized lines has not caused any significant issues for the SFPUC or public safety. These lines are often buried much deeper than other utilities and therefore are less likely to be struck. San Francisco has approximately 2,000 miles of sewer mains and laterals, and the potential benefit of marking these lines does not outweigh the additional cost this would impose on our ratepayers due to the need to hire multiple new staff to perform this marking. Solution/ Recommended Proposal The SFPUC recommends an oppose position unless the exemption for nonpressurized sewer lines and storm drains in Government Code Section 4216(s) is reinstated. 48 Departments Impacted & Why The SFPUC's Wastewater Enterprise will be significantly impacted by the requirement to mark nonpressurized sewer lines , laterals , and storm drain lines . Any other City agencies that are utility owners or representatives that marks subsurface installations will be affected by other changes to this legislation. This may include the Department of Public Works and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. We have consulted both of these departments and they do no t have concerns with this proposed Oppose Unless Amended position. Fiscal Impact If SB 778 becomes law, the SFPUC will need to hire more full- time employees (FTE) to fulfill this work. A t least five FTEs would need to be created, based on the number of FTEs who do this work for our Water Enterprise. If the bill is interpreted in a way that requires us to mark lateral sewers (which are owned by the property owner), we would likely need at least double this amount for 10 FTEs total.

Friedman , District 44, Democrat Cosmetic safety Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill prohibits the sale in California of cosmetic products containing any one of 26 carcinogens, reproductive toxins, and endocrine disruptors beginning January 1, 2025. Background/Analysis Cosmetics sold in California and the United States are largely unregulated. Notwithstanding California's recent prohibition o f 13 chemicals, few ingredients are restricted from use in cosmetics , and regulators have limited authority to guarantee products' safety. While the Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 bans the sale of harmful cosmetics , the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not conduct safety testing or review products to ensure that cosmetic s are safe before go ing out to market. Instead, federal law relies on manufactures to verify their products ' safety and allows the FDA to recall products found to pose serious health risks to consumers . Congress recently grant ed the FDA the authority to review company safety records under limited circumstances but did not direct the FDA to review chemicals of concern. Under California law, the Sherman Act classifies cosmetics containing poisonous o r toxic substances as misbranded, prohibiting them from sale in our state. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) oversees the Sherman Act's misbranded cosmetics ban but has not developed regulation to enforce it. The Safe Cosmetics Program , which is also run by CDPH , requires cosmetics manufacturers to report the pre sence of any Prop. 65 -listed chemical - known to cause cancer, birth defects or reproductive harm - in a cosmetic product sold in California. Based on these reports, 613 cosmetics companies in California have sold over 75,000 beauty and personal care produ cts containing chemicals linked to cancers, birth defects , or reproductive harm since 2009 alone . Because cosmetics are regularly washed off after use, their environmental risks are particularly alarming . More than 80 nations have ban ned or restricted the use o f hundreds of cosmetic ingredients. The European Union and the Association of Southe ast Asian Nations have prohibited or greatly 50 restricted the use of almost 1 ,400 chemicals in cosmetics. Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Japan have similarly banned or restricted numerous chemicals that remain common in American cosmetics . Major retailers such as Credo Beauty , CVS, Rite Aid, and Target have developed their own lists of chemicals prohibited in their cosmetic products. Challen ge Due to lac k of regulation and strong government oversight, consumers in California cannot easily discern whether their cosmetics and personal care products are free of toxic ingredients. Workers in hair and nail salons are particularly vulnerable because they interact with these chemicals throughout their workday. San Franciscans deserve greater protections against exposure to harmful chemicals in the products they rely on every day. Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 496 pro hibits the sale in California of cosmetic products containing any one of 26 highly toxic chemicals, all of which the European Union has banned from use in cosmetics sold in its member nations.

Rivas, District 43 , Democrat Eliminating Problematic Plastics Act Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would prohibit in California the manufactur e, sale, or distribution of opaque or pigmented polyethylene terephthalate bottles, and plastic packaging contain ing certain chemicals, pigments, or additives beginning January 1, 2026. Background/Analysis Certain plastic packaging materials and additives can make plastic difficult to recycle and pose risks to human and environmental health . These materials and additives include per- (PETG), and certain pigments. The Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act, which affects single -use packaging and plastic food service ware , requires producers to reduce their amount covered plastic material. The law also requires producers to ensure that covered material offered for sale or distribution in California is recyclable or compost able by 2032. Existing California law prohibits the use of PFAS in food packaging and requires manufacturer s to use the least toxic alternative when replacing regulated PFAS in food packaging . Challenge San Francisco aims to reduce waste generation by 15% and disposal to landfill by 50% by 2030 (from a 2015 baseline). San Francisco has long implemented leading programs to collect and recycle as much plastics as possible. However, plastics that are difficult or impossible to recycle contin ue to proliferate. I n recent years , recycling markets have become increasingly restrictive with respect to plastics containing certain chemicals and additives, many of which are harmful to human health throughout their lifecycle. Solution/Recommended Prop osal This bill would phase out the use of select chemicals , pigments, and additives in plastic beginning in 2026.

Wiener, District 11, Democrat Corporate Climate Data Accountability Act Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would require large companies doing business in California to publicly disclose their S cope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This bill will hold businesses accountable for the entire lifecycle of their operational impacts and contributions to climate change. Background/Analysis SB 253 would require covered companies to submit annual GHG emissions inventory reports to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which the 2006 California Global Warming Solutions Act tasks with the regulation, verification, and monitoring of statewide greenhouse gas emissions. CARB will publish the information online and work with the University of California to analyze and compare that information to the state's climate and emissions reduction goals. Covered companies include American privately held or publicly traded corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships doing business in California with annual revenues of $1 billion dollars or more. An estimated 5,000 companies would be required report their annual scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissi ons. Reporting requirements would not begin until 2026, which would allow covered companies time to develop internal capacity, staffing, and data collection practices needed to meet these requirements. Reporting standards would closely follow the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard . SB 253 was introduced as one of three bills that making up the Climate Accountability Package , which also includes SB 252 (the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act) and SB 261 ( the Climate -Related Financial Risk Act). (The San Francisco Board of Supervisors previously adopted a resolution support ing SB 252 in February). Challenge While there has been some success in voluntary emissions reporting by Fortune 500 companies, one area of the proposed framework has been largely unreported : Also known as downstream emissions, Scope 3 emissions do not derive from a company's owned or controlled assets, but rather from their supply and value chains. According to analys es from UC Berkeley's Cool Climate Network and similar groups, Scope 3 emissio ns comprise the single largest category of a company's emissions . When 54identified , they can provide valuable insight into a company or industry's climate impacts. Without this information, it is impossible to accurately discern a company's total carbon foo tprint. This bill addresses this gap by requiring reporting on Scope 3 emissions in addition to Scope 1 (direct operational emissions) and Scope 2 (emissions from energy purchases). Solution/Recommended Proposal The Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act would strengthen and expand the state's emissions reduction targets developed in the 2006 California Global Warming Solutions Act by integrating large businesses and corporations directly into the state's GHG emissions inventory and planning efforts. Additionally, this bill aligns with upcoming SEC reporting requirements for publicly traded companies by expanding reporting requirements to privately held companies , effectively tripling the number of covered companies.

Stern, District 27, Democrat Climate- Related Risk Disclosure Act Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would require large companies doing business in California to publicly report their climate -related financial risk. This bill would ensure that financial institutions and businesses are taking the necessary steps to mitigate and adapt to global climate impacts . Background/Analysis This bill would cover American corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships doing business in California, including privately held or publicly traded corporations , with annual revenues greater than $500 million . This bill would require compa nies to report on their climate -related financial risk. Companies in the insurance industry would be exempted from this law . The reporting framework would follow widely used and accepted standards developed by the International Task Force on Climate -Relate d Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In addition, these companies would also be required to develop and implement measures to reduce, mitigate, or adapt to the risks identified through the reporting process. All covered companies would be required to publish their climate -related risk disclosures online and submit a copy to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which the 2006 California Global Warming Solutions Act tasks with the regulation, verification, and monitoring of statewide greenhouse gas emissio ns. An advisory group will be formed to analyze the reported information and study the issues financial institutions and businesses face in adapting to climate change. The first of these reports would be due by December 31, 2024. SB 261 was introduced as one of three bills mak ing up the Climate Accountability Package , which also includes SB 252 ( the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act ) and SB 253 (the Climate Corporate Accountability Act). (The San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution supporting SB 2 52 in February .) Challenge Climate change presents serious risks to the economic health of the entire state, including companies from all industry sectors. These risks include supply chain disruptions , negative impacts on employee health and safety, damage and loss of capital and financial investments, and reduced consumer demand. Because of these threats, California requires a system that promotes risk preparedness and support s 56accountability, measurement, and action. Standardized, reliable, and mand atory climate risk disclosures will promote stability and economic resilience. San Francisco is a prominent business and financial hub with a long history of attracting business headquarters and regional offices. Under this bill, numerous companies with offices in San Francisco will be required to disclose their financial risk. This information will alert local leaders and the public to the challenges that climate change presents and inform locally tailored solutions to attract more business and sustain a robust economy. Solution/Recommended Proposal The Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act would build upon the 2006 California Global Warming Solutions Act by addressing risks specific to businesses and the economy at large. Additionally, this bill aligns with upcoming SEC reporting requirements for publicly traded companies by expanding reporting requirements to privately held companies, which comprise nearly 80% of the businesses covered by this bill. SB 261 will help companies, lawmakers , and the public understand, prepare for, and take action to protect the economy from short - and long -term climate risks.

Blakespear , District 38, Democrat Greenhouse gas emissions inventories Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary The bill would instruct the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to publish greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory data for municipalities on a publicly accessible database to help simplify climate action planning for municipalities in California . This legislation would help shift municipal resources away from time -consuming GHG accounting activities and toward impactful, consistent, and standardized implementation of climate programs. Background/Analysis GHG inventories are important and informative analyses that quantify emissions from a given entity, in this case local governments. These inventories help communities develop GHG emissions benchmark s, monitor progress , and allow analyzis of emissions trends over time. In 2006, California passed the landmark Global Warming Solutions Act, which mandated a statewide GHG emissions reduction of 15% by 2020. In 2016 the legislature passed SB 32, which mandated a target of 40% GHG emissions reductions by 2030 (from a 1990 baseline). Challenge San Francisco has been at the forefront of climate action planning and GHG emissions reporting for almost 20 years. San Francisco adopted its first Climate Action Plan in 2004, followed by significant updates in 2012 and 2021, and calculated its first majo r, communitywide GHG inventory in 2012. In addition, San Francisco has tracked department -level GHG inventories since 2008. However, many municipalities in California lack the resources to adopt climate actions or GHG inventories. Staffing shortages, high turnover, and the lack of adequate and necessary data can thwart municipalities' attempts to develop such systems. Data accessibility is particularly critical to the success of climate programs in drafting and implementing strong and reliable GHG emission s inventories. Solution/Recommended Proposal SB 511 would require CARB to develop and share GHG inventories and data with municipalities beginning in 2025. This bill would benefit the state and the climate movement because it eases the burden o f preparing GHG inventories for municipalities. It would create a standardized and centralized repository , including emissions data , calculation tools, and other best practices. SB 511 is a critical tool for 58policy makers and the public to understand the state's pr ogress in meeting its climate commitments. It also decreases the outsize d burden that small communities face when developing climate action plans. Departments Impacted & Why San Francisco Environment Department is responsible for preparing the communitywide GHG inventory for the C ity and County of San Francisco . Many other departments, including SFPUC, SFMTA, SFCTA, contribute data to this effort . The methodology proposed by SB 511 mirrors the methodology currently used to conduct San Francisco's annual communitywide GHG inventory ( ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Version 1.2 ). Fiscal Impact SB 511 is expected to save San Francisco Environment Department funding that could be reallocated toward other goals, including decarbonization in environmental justice communities and other programs developed under the 2021 Climate Action Plan.

Newman , District 29, Democrat Responsible Textile Recovery Act of 2023 Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary SB 707 creates a statewide textile repair and recycling extended producer responsibility program to reduce the increasing volume of unusable textiles in landfills. Background/Analysis SB 707 would require producers of textiles and textile articles to design and fund an extended producer responsibility program to collect, repair, and recycle these items. The program would use California's network of thrift and secondhand businesses to collect unwanted textiles for sorting and recycling, with textiles that can be reused or repaired being sorted for those purposes. The bill would have strong oversight by state regulators and a robust education and outreach requirement to ensure that consumers know how to access the program. Reducing textile waste is important to San Francisco, which has two zero waste climate action commitments to reduce disposal to landfill by 50% by 2023 and two to reduce waste generation by 15% by 2030 . Household -generated textile waste is among the fastest -growing material waste streams in our city and in California. San Francisco alone sends nearly 20,000 tons of textiles to landfill annually. To meet our zero waste climate commitments , we must recover textiles from our landfill stream. Challenge Despite our attempts to identify recycling markets since 201 7, there are still no widespread and viable textile recycling markets available for California jurisdictions. In addition, our donation centers are overflowing with unusable textiles as residents struggle to find ways to properly dispose of clothing, fabrics, and bedding. In one year alone , we received over 40 inquiries from community members regarding how to donate, recycle, repair, or dispose of te xtiles . Solution/Recommended Proposal This policy would reduce the number of textiles San Francisco sends to landfill, expand access to textile recycling and repair markets , and alleviate costs for donation centers as the public's main way of ridding of t heir textiles. 60 Departments Impacted & Why No departments are affected by this mandate. The Environment Department may need to report to CalRecycle if legislation passes. Fiscal Impact The f iscal impact of this bill in San Francisco is unknown. However, this bill would reduce the number of textiles going to landfill, therefore reducing disposal costs .

Wilson , District 11, Democrat Specialized Inclusivity Training for Child Care Staff Grant Program Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill would establish the Specialized Inclusivity Training for Child Care Staff Grant Program to fund staff training on including children with disabilities and improve access to child care for children with disabilities in California. Background/Analysis Decades of research have established that inclusive child care programs that serve children with and without exceptional needs are higher quality and have better outcomes for all children. The quality of practices in inclusive classrooms is highly dependent on professional development . Training on inclusion has a large impact on the overall program and has shown positive outcomes. Staff with training are more comfortable and confident providing accommodations and have more positive thoughts about inclusion. When early educators are trained to include children with and without exceptional needs, organizations are more likely to openly welcome children with varying abilities. Inclusion -specific education is the biggest factor in predicting whether programs are inclusive. If the director, provider, or teacher has some exceptional needs/inclusion related training, the program is more likely to have children with exceptional needs enrolled . Challenge According to the most recent data from the National Survey on Children's Health, 1 in 5 children have a mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral disorder. Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to ensure that eligible children with exceptional needs are given equal access to child care and development programs. A child with exceptional needs must never be turned away from a n early education/preschool center or Family Child Care program based on assumptions about the severity of the needs or how much assistance and /or accommodations they may need. Despite legal obligations, parents of children with exceptional needs are more likely to have difficulty with child care arrangements . Early education programs are often hesitant to include children with exceptional needs because they feel inadequate to meet the child's needs. Special needs knowledge, awareness, and skills should be components of ongoing professional development provided within child care and 62 development programs. The reality is that adults working with children are often not given the information or tools to implement inclusion effectively . The pandemic has added to the struggle, with staffing shortages placing additional stress on an already ov erwhelmed system. Solution/Recommended Proposa l Establishing the Specialized Inclusivity Training for Child Care Staff Grant Program to fund staff training on including children with disabilities and improve access to child care for children with disabilities in California. Departments Impacted & Why Department of Early Childhood (DEC): DEC has heard from San Francisco providers about the need for more training, professional development and support regarding including children with exceptional nee ds in their centers and FCC homes. DEC's city- supported Early Learning SF (ELS) network prioritizes serving DEC priority populations, including children with exceptional needs . As DEC leverages state funding and policies, state impacts to these agencies can influence DEC funding and policy decisions. Fiscal Impact There is potential fiscal impact to funding from DEC as a result of changes to state supported early educator programs . DEC currently supports access to early educator training and professional development , including inclus ivity and best practices for serving children with exceptional needs . Additional state support could enhance/replace this local funding and enable DEC to divert support for other essential resources for the early educator workforce .

Reyes , District 47, Democrat Child Care Rate Reform and Suspension of Family Fees Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 596 will help early learning and childcare providers and families by transitioning providers to a single cost based reimbursement rate, suspending family fees until an equitable sliding scale for family fees is established, and funding providers using an enrollment based contract earning mechanism. This is a companion bill to SB 3 80 (Limon ). Background/Analysis Without affordable and available child care, parents cannot work. Throughout the state , and in San Francisco, there are empty early childhood classrooms because providers cannot hire teachers to staff them. In California, Family Child Care (FCC) homes have been forced to close due to a lack of sufficient funding. These are funded child care spaces that will not be utilized because of the antiquated state cost model , despite a huge need for child care. Families , particularly the most marginalized, are left to make increasingly difficult choices. California has been subsidizing the true cost of child care by paying the early learning and child care workforce low wages and expecting families to pay high family fees for subsidized child care programs . Early educators are some of the lowest paid workers across the country and many have left the profession to find better paying careers. While San Francisco is implementing initiatives to combat these issues, such as our ECE Workforce Compensation Initiative and providing funding to enhance inadequate s tate reimbursement rates, i t is essential that California stabilize the child care sector and reduce costs to low -income families. Challenge Currently, California uses two methodologies for determining reimbursement rates for early learning and care services - the Regional Market Rate (RMR) and the Standard Reimbursement Rate (SRR). The RMR is based on regional cost surveys for licensed providers, including voucher - based programs , and the SRR is based in statute for Title 5 providers for programs with direct state contract s. The SRR does not account for geographic costs and neither rate structure accounts for the actual cost of providing care to children. Efforts to move to one single reimbursement rate structure have not been realized. AB 131 required the State and Child Care Providers United (CCPU) to establish a committee to develop recommendations for a single reimbursement rate structure by November 2022. AB 131 also required the California Department of Social Services 64 (CDSS) and the California Department of Education (CDE) to establish a working group to assess the existing quality standards for child care and development and preschool programs and the methodology for establishing reimbursement rates for those programs. In addition to recommending implementation of a single rate structure for publicly -funded childcare in California, the Rate and Quality Workgroup also recommended increasing affordability by making adjustments to family fee requirements and to the method in which subsidized contr actors earn their contract. In 2022, the State waived family fees for another year. However, the waiver is set to expire in June 2023 and families will begin receiving a monthly bill of up to $595 at the start of July 2023 unless family fees are suspended for state and federally -funded programs. With limited disposable income, working families struggle to pay high fees and are forced to make difficult decisions about their basic needs. Solution/Recommended Proposa l AB 596 will require CDSS to apply to the federal Health and Human Services Agency to amend the State's current Child Care and Development Fund State Plan to change reimbursement rates by using an alternative methodology to include a cost -based model consistent with the recommendations of the CDS S-led Rate and Quality Workgroup report and the CCPU committee . It also considers the true cost of providing care by considering current statutory and regulatory requirements, staff salaries, training, supplies, ratios, enrollment levels, facilities, and family engagement. The bill will require that this methodology be updated regularly to account for rising costs in care. Additionally, it will require CDE and CDSS to suspend family fees until an equitable sliding scale for the payment of family fees is established. Finally, AB 596 requires that providers are paid based on the number of children enrolled in their programs instead of attendance. Departments Impacted & Why Department of Early Childhood (DEC): The majority of the Family Child Care and center -based programs that are part of DEC's city -supported Early Learning SF (ELS) network also provide state subsidized spaces through the state programs impacted by this bill. They serve the highest percentage of DEC priority populations. As DEC leverages state funding and policies, state impacts to these agencies can influence DEC funding and policy decisions. Fiscal Impact There is potential fiscal impact to funding from DEC as a result of changes to state reimbursement rates .

Menjivar , District 20, Democrat Early Education and Child care: developmental screenings Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary SB 635 would provide tens of thousands of children with access to early childhood developmental screening and other appropriate developmental screenings. It would also ensure that children ages 0 -5 who need additional services after screening are referred for further assessment and intervention at no cost to the parent. Background/Analysis The Department of Developmental Services (DDS) oversees the services and support to over 400,000 individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. The Early Start Program provides for the delivery of these services to infants and toddlers at risk of having developmental disabilities. Eligibility for these services and support are determined by the Regiona l Center (RC) system which coordinate community -based services through service coordinators. Child care and home visits are existing services received by tens of thousands of children and families throughout California. State -subsidized p rograms such as Alternative Payment, General Child Care, CalWORKS, Family Child Care Home Education Network (FCCHEN), and California State Preschool are provided in local communities and have established relationships with the children and families they serve. They are in a unique position to support families in accessing early screening services for their children and make referrals to developmental and trauma services. These services assist families in supporting the growth and development of their childr en through early identification and referral services. These services are critical in helping children reach their full potential to thrive in school and life . There is a need for a clear pathway for eligible families to access services through existing se rvices and relationships in their home language, accessible locations, and during convenient hours. Challenge Many children with developmental delays or behavior concerns are not identified as early as possible, delaying their access to help in social and educational settings. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), in the United States, about 1 in 6 children aged 3 to 17 have one or more developmental or behavioral disabilities such as autism, a learning disorder, or 68 attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, many children with developmental disabilities are not identified until they are in school, by which time significant delays might have occurred and opportunities for treatment may have been missed. A 2023 Report by the Early Childhood Technical Center found that racial and economic disparities also occur in access to early intervention, screening, identification, and referral. In the past year 36% of families above low income reported that their child had received a screening in comparison to 27.2% of low income families . Black and African American families have the lowest screening and respo nse rate due to affordability and insurance issues. Research shows that early intervention treatment services can greatly improve a child's development. Services can include a variety of options based on a child's need, but many parents aren't aware of whe re to access support or figure out what steps to take to support their child's development. Solution/Recommended Proposa l California has the opportunity to reach tens of thousands of children, who are currently being served in either subsidized child care programs and through home visiting support services by providing each child in these programs the opportunity to be screened for development and trauma concerns. SB 635 would direct all state subsidized child care programs (Alternative Payment, Genera l Child Care, CalWORKS, and FCCHEN, California State Preschool) and home visiting programs to screen all children, following family consent, with an Ages and Stages screening (for children 0 -5) and other appropriate developmental screenings ; direct the California Departments of Education (CDE) and Social Services (CDSS) to set up a centralized billing point to draw down Federal Funding to pay the subsidized child care programs for providing the screening ; and d irect CDE and CDSS to work with the Department of Health Care Services, the Department of Developmental Services, and the Office of the Surgeon General to establish processes to ensure identified children are receiving needed intervention services in a timely manner and in their home language. Departm ents Impacted & Why Department of Early Childhood (DEC ): The majority of the Family Child Care and center -based programs that are part of DEC's city- supported Early Learning SF (ELS) network also provide state subsidized spaces through the state programs impacted by this bill. They serve the highest percentage of DEC priority populations. As DEC leverages state funding and policies, state impacts to these agencies can influence DEC funding and policy decisions. Fiscal Impact There is p otential fiscal impa ct to funding from DEC as a result of changes to state subsidized child care . DEC currently supports access to Ages and Stages developmental screenings for ELS programs . Additional state support could enhance/ replace this local funding and enable DEC to divert support for other essential resources for young children and their families.

Skinner , District 9, Democrat Suspensions and Expulsions: Willful Defiance Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary Senate Bill 274 would remove disrupting school activities and willful defiance from being on the list of acts for which a pupil, regardless of their grade enrollment, may be suspended or recommended for expulsion. Additionally, this bill will remove the ability to suspend or expel pupils who are truant, tardy, or otherwise absent from school activities. DCYF would support this bill fully based on the research confirming students of color, homeless, with disabilities, in foster care, and/or LGBTQIA+ are more likely to be suspended for behavior deemed to be willfully defiant. Background/Analysis Under the existing law, pupils cannot be suspended or recommended for expulsion, unless the superintendent of the school district or the principal of the school determines that the pupil has committed a specific act, which includes disrupting school activities or being willfully defiant. Additionally, under the existing law, until July 1, 2025, pupil's grades 6 to 8 cannot be suspended for disrupting school activities or willful defiance. This includes charter schools. Finally, under existing law, the intent of the legislature is that alternatives to suspension or expulsion may be imposed against a pupil who is truant, tardy, or otherwise absent from school activities. However, it does mean that under current law, suspension or expulsion for pupils who are truant or tardy is still an option. Challenge With the current law of allowing schools to suspend or expel pupils based on disrupting school activities or being willfully defiant, there is an opening for more students of color, homeless, with disabilities , in foster care, and/or LGBTQIA+ to be suspended or expelled based on subjective behavior deemed to be willfully defiant or disruptive. Additionally, with the current law, while alternatives to suspension and expulsion is the intent of the Legislature for truant or tardy students, alternative efforts may not always be taken. This problem impacts the children of San Francisco because students of color, homeless, with disabilities, in foster care, and/or LGBTQIA+ in San Francisco can be impacted by the subjectivity of how staff respond to students disrupting school activities, being willfully defiant, and being tardy or truant. 70 Solution/Recommended Proposal The solution that this bill is proposing is to remove disrupting school activities and willful defiance from the list of acts for which a student, regardless of their grade, may be suspended or expelled. This bill would also extend the prohibition of suspension that expires on July 1, 2025, based on those acts within charter schools to be indefinite for all grades. Finally, this bill will prohibit a suspension or expulsion from being imposed on students that are tardy or truant. This solution will positively impact the children of San Francisco as it will remove subjectivity for how school staff can respond to students disrupting school activities, being willfully defiant, and being tardy or truant. Departments Impacted & Why San Francisco Unified School District's policy is already consistent with the main intent of this bill. There is already a policy in place that prohibits suspension or expulsion based solely on the basis of disruptive or willfully defiant behavior. SB 274 would codify the policy that SFUSD already has in place. The impact would require SFUSD to review the current policy and ensure that it is in compliance with the language in SB 274.

Skinner , District 9, Democrat Features that harm child users: civil penalty Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary Senate Bill 287 would prohibit social media platform s from using a design, algorithm, or feature that the platform knows, or with the exercise of reasonable care should have known causes child users increased risk of harm, including addiction to the social media platform. DCYF would fully support this bill fully because we recognize that these algorithms can cause harm and increase risk in a number of ways , for example by promoting eating disorders or offering information on how to die by suicide. We also support that this bill lifts up the California Age - App ropriate Design Code Act which states that a business that provides an online service, product, or feature likely to be accessed by children to comply with specified requirements, including a requirement to configure all default privacy settings offered by the online service, product, or feature to the settings that offer a high level of privacy, as prescribed, and is required of a business. This r equires new online services, products, or features that are offered to the public, complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment for any online service, product, or feature likely to be accessed by children and maintain documentation of this assessment if the online service, product, or feature is likely to be accessed by children. Background/Analysis Under the Ca lifornia Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, businesses cannot sell personal information of a consumer if the business knows the consumer is under 16 years of age and/or does not have parental consent. Under the California Age -Appropriate Design Code Act, beginn ing July 1, 2024, businesses that have online services and products likely to be accessed by children will need to have default settings offering a high level of privacy. Social media platforms, which have a lot of children using the platform, currently ha ve an algorithm that can collect data off users which can lead to addiction of the social media platform or cause an increased risk of harm for the user. This bill prohibits social media platforms from using a design or algorithm which can cause children t o have an increased risk of harm and addiction . 72 Challenge The problem that this bill is trying to solve is preventing social media platforms from using a design, algorithm, or features that the platform knows, or should reasonably know, causes an increased risk of harm to child users, such as content that facilitates the purchase of fentanyl, developing an eating disorder, causing an addiction to the social media platform, and other forms of increased risk of harm. Many children in San Francisco use social media platforms, which means that based on the platform's design, algorithm, or features children in San Francisco might be exposed to various content which can increase their risk to harm or addiction. This bill will help prevent that increase ri sk for San Francisco children. Solution/Recommended Proposal The solution that this bill is proposing is to have the social media platforms institute and maintain a program of quarterly audits of its design, algorithms and features to detect designs, algorithms, and features that have the potential to cause and contribute to the increased risk of harm for children. Social media platforms have 30 days after completion of the audit to apply corrections to the design, algorithm, or feature that poses an increased risk of harm to children. This bill would subject a social media platform that knowingly and willfully violates the provisions with a fine not exceeding $250,000 per violation. Through the regular audits that this bill is proposing, it will help San Francisco children avoid seeing content that increases their risk of harm.

Cortese , District 15, Democrat Homeless Pupils: California Success, Opportunity, and Academic Resili ence (SOAR) Guaranteed Income Program Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary Senate Bill 333 would require the State Department of Social Services to establish the California Success, Opportunity, and Academic Resilience (SOAR) Guaranteed Income Program. This program would award public school pupils who are in the 12th grade and are homeless children or youths, a guaranteed income of $1,000 each month for 5 months from April 1, 2025, to August 1, 2025. DCYF would support this bill fully based on the needs of who we would consider a priority population with greater needs, homeless youth, and because youth will receive a guaranteed based income of $1,000 for five months and funds would not be considered income for public social service programs or other purposes and would not negatively impact the award recipient's eligibility for future public social service programs . Background/Analysis There are existing laws that establish various public social services programs to provide eligible recipients with certain benefits, such as the CalWORKs program, CalFresh program, and Medi- Cal. These programs can provide additional services to eligible recipients. The existing law also allows for the e stablishment of various programs to aid homeless youth, including, homeless youth emergency service pilot projects and the Runaway Youth and Families in Crisis Projects. These laws show that there is a necessity and pathway for adding additional support, specifically for homeless children and youth. Challenge The problem that this bill is trying to solve is to provide additional financial support for homeless children and youth who are in 12th grade at a public high school for 5 months between April1, 2025 to August 1, 2025. This would impact the children and youth of San Francisco as there is a houseless population of children and youth in the city. San Francisco children and youth feel the impact of this problem due to how expensive housing is in the area. There potentially are some 12 th grade public school homeless children and youth who would benefit from this problem being addressed by this bill. 74 Solution/Recommended Proposal The solution that this bill is proposing is to have the California State Department of Social Services to establish the California Success, Opportunity, and Academic Resilience (SOAR) Guaranteed Income Program which will provide homeless 12 th graders who attend public schools a guaranteed income of $1,000 a month for 5 months. Having this added financial support for 5 months, offered along with other established public social service programs, can help homeless 12 th grades in San Francisco. Additionally, this bill would ensure that for tax year starting on January 1, 2025, the i ncome received from this program would not be included in gross income for personal income taxes which means that the homeless 12th graders in San Francisco would not have an additional tax burden due to this program. Departments Impacted & Why San Francisco Unified School District would be impacted because they would have to form or work with a local educational agency liaison to identify eligible participants for the purposes of assisting the State Department of Social Services in distributing entitled a wards. Department of Children, Youth, and their Families would be impacted because they might be the department that would have to take on the additional duties of a local educational agency liaison or have a state -mandated local program. Fiscal Impact The California Constitution requires the states to reimburse local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by the state. This bill will provide reimbursement if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by t he state.

Bauer -Kahan, D istrict 16, Democrat Confidentiality of Medical Information Act: reproductive or sexual health application information Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary Assemblymember Bauer -Kahan introduced AB 2 54, which ensures the privacy and security of individuals' information when they opt to use apps and websites that provide reproductive and sexual health services. Background/Analysis Reproductive and sexual health information is particularly sensitive given the criminalization of almost any form of ending a pregnancy since the overturn of Roe v. Wade . Apps and websites that explicitly market themselves as providing menstrual and pregnancy tracking are creating an expectation of healthcare and the associated privacy of information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides consumers with important privacy rights and protections with respect to their health information, including important controls over how their health information is used and disclosed by health plans and health care providers. Ensuring strong privacy protections is critical to maintaining individuals' trust in their health care providers and willingness to obtain needed health care services, and these protections are especially important where very sensitive information is concerned, such as mental health and reproductive health information. Challenge The current lack of protection for sensitive information collected by menstrual tracking apps and other digital services leaves individuals vulnerable to criminalization and predatory advertising based on their reproductive health choices. This legislation is critically needed as some states have already moved to criminalize abortion and gender -affirming healthcare, putting millions of people at risk. In addition to the legal risks, the information sharing can result in users being tracked across the internet with ads about this sensitive information. This predatory advertising can be incredibly stigmatizing and dissuades people from getting care. AB 254 extends the privacy safeguards of the CA Confidential Medical Information Act (CMIA) to digital services that offer sexual and reproductive healthcare, offering a vital layer of protection for this sensitive information. The consequences of this vulnerable data falling into the wrong hands 76 are dire, and AB 254 prevents this from happening by creating a secure and continuous data protection across all health platforms. Solution/Recommended Proposal AB 254 revises the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) to include reproductive or sexual health application information into the definition of medical information. It also d eems a business that offers a reproductive or sexual health digital service to a consumer for the purpose of allowing the individual to manage the individual's information, or for the individual's diagnosis, treatment, or management of a medical condition, to be a provider of health care, as specified.

Weber , District 79 , Democrat Medi -Cal: reimbursement for abortion Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 576 e nsures patients that rely on Medi- Cal can access medication abortion in line with up- to- date clinical guidelines and peer -reviewed scientific evidence. Background/Analysis Existing law : Establishes the Medi- Cal program, which is administered by the Stat e Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low -income individuals receive health care services. The Medi -Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions; Provides that abortion is a covered benefit under Medi -Cal; and Authorizes reimbursement for specified medications used to terminate a pregnancy through the 70th day from the first day of the recipient's last menstrual period. Challenge Medication abortion is widely used and proven to be safe and effective, but with more and more states criminalizing reproductive health care providers and patients, access to this FDA - approved treatment and other services is being further restricted every day. In fact, a major national pharmacy chain recently said it would end the distribution of abortion medication not only in states where it is now illegal, but also in some states where it remains lawful, following a pressure campaign by anti -abortion attorneys general in those states. AB 576, will ensure that access to medication abortion is protected, and that the type of medication abortion a woman is prescribed is not determined by income but science. 78 Solution/ Recommended Proposal This bill would require the department to fully reimburse providers for the provision of medication to terminate a pregnancy that aligns with clinical guidelines, evidence -based research, and the discretion of the provider. This bill would require the department, by March 1, 2024, to review and update Medi -Cal coverage policies for medication abortion to align with current evidence -based clinical guidelines. After the initial review, the bill would require the department to update its Medi- Cal coverage policies for medication abortion as needed to align with evidence -based clinica l guidelines. The bill would require the department to allow flexibility for providers to exercise their clinical judgment when services are performed in a manner that aligns with one or more evidence- based clinical guidelines.

Wicks , Assembly District 14, Democrat Sexual health education and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention education: school climate and safety: California Healthy Kids Survey Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary AB 598 , introduced by Assembly member Wicks r equires school districts , including those in the City and County of San Francisco, to participate in the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) and include a module on sexual and reproductive health care as one of the core survey modules. Background/Analysis Existing law, the California Healthy Youth Act, requires school districts to ensure that all pupils in grades 7 to 12, inclusive, receive comprehensive sexual health education and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention education, as specified. Under the act, this ins truction includes, among other things, information about local resources related to sexual and reproductive health, pregnancy prevention and care, and assistance with sexual assault and intimate partner violence, and information about pregnancy, including parenting, adoption, and abortion, as provided. This bill would revise the information included in this instruction related to local resources and abortion, as specified, and would require that pupils receive a physical or digital resource detailing certain local resources upon completion of the applicable instruction. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state -mandated local program. Challenge Following the Dobbs decision in 2022, it is critical that studen ts in California, including in the City and County of San Francisco, are taught about reproductive and sexual health care. Assemblymember Wicks' bill expands California's sexual reproductive education requirements to ensure young people have knowledge, and know where to, and how to receive abortion care along with contraception care and all the other care that our young people deserve to know about it. 80 The bill also ensures that California school districts are required to administer the California Healthy Survey test that includes a test around reproductive care and contraceptive care in that healthy survey so that policymakers and educators can have data around what our young people are experiencing and how they understand these issues, and how they can create the appropriate curriculum for students moving forward. Solution/Recommended Proposal Existing law authorizes anonymous, voluntary, and confidential research and evaluation tools to measure pupils' health behaviors and risks, including tests, questionnaires, and surveys containing age-appropriate questions about the pupil's attitudes concerning or practices relating to sex, to be administered to any pupil in grades 7 to 12, inclusive. The California Healthy Kids Survey is an anonymous, confidential survey of school climate and safety, student wellness, and youth resiliency. This bill would require the State Department of Education to ensure the California Healthy Kids Survey includes questions about sexual and reproductive health care as a core survey module for pupils in grades 7, 9, and 11. The bill would require each school district serving pupils in any of grades 5, 7, 9, or 11 to administer the California Healthy Kids Survey to pupils in the applicable grades, as provided. By imposing new requirements on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state -mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts fo r certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Schiavo, District 40, Democrat State Department of Public Health: pregnancy care and abortion services awareness campaign Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill will launch a public information campaign to provide women with accurate information regarding access to abortion care at crisis pregnancy centers. Background/Analysis Existing law: Provides for the licensure and regulation of clinics and health facilities, including, but not limited to, primary care and specialty clinics, by the State Department of Public Health (DPH) . DPH is also responsible for the statewide administration of various programs and policies relating to personal health, including maternal, child, and adolescent health. Requires DPH to develop a coordinated state strategy for addressing the health -related needs of women, including implementation of goals and objectives for women's health, as specified. Challenge Crisis pregnancy centers (CPC) engage in purposefully manipulative and deceptive practices that spread misinformation on sexual health and abortion. CPCs have also been shown to delay access to medically legitimate prenatal and abortion care, which negatively impacts maternal health. This bill will ensure that women seeking reproductive health care receive accurate information and the misinformation of these CPC's is actively combated. Solution/ Recommended Proposal This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation relating to crisis pregnancy centers. DPH would be required to conduct an awareness campaign to communicate with local health departments, health care providers, and the public regarding facilities that provide health care services, including, but not limited to, primary care and specialty clinics. The awareness campaign would include information about the services the facilities offer, and the activities of the department, relating to pregnancy care and abortion. 82 Additionally, t he awareness campaign would provide outreach to, among others, health care professional associations and societies and health care employers.

Carrillo , District 52, Democrat California Privacy Rights Act Of 2020: Exemptions: Abortion Services Recommended Position SPONSOR X SUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary This bill will e nsure that businesses can not use exemptions under the Consumer Privacy Rights Act to share information about a consumer accessing, procuring, or searching for services regarding contraception, pregnancy care, and perinatal care, including abortion services. Background/Analysis Under Existing law , the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA), grants a consumer various rights with respect to personal information that is collected or sold by a business , including the right to require the business to delete personal information about the consumer unless those obligations restrict a business' s ability to, among other things, comply with federal, state, or local laws or comply with a court order or subpoena to provide information, or cooperate with a government agency request for emergency access to a consumer's personal information if a natural person is at risk or danger of death or serious physical injury, as provided. Challenge Following the fall of Roe, states across the country have enact ed laws restrict ing access to reproductive health services, and in some instances , enact ed complete bans on abortion services . Health care providers, patients , and /or third parties assisting in the procurement of an abortion, are increasingly at risk for incurring civil and/ or criminal penaltie s. Unfortunately, it is becoming more and more apparent, that those in opposition to abortion access are able to employ new ways to penalize individuals seeking abortion and reproductive health services, regardless of whether they are located in a state th at restricts access. Solution/ Recommended Proposal This bill will ensure that consumer information related to reproductive health and abortion services remains private by preventing businesses from maintaining and potentially sharing that information with third parties . When a consumer 's personal information contains information related to accessing, procuring, or searching for services regarding contraception, pregnancy care, and perinatal care, including, 84 but not limited to, abortion services, this bill would require business es to comply with the obligations imposed by the CPR A. Specifically, this bill would make it clear that a consumer accessing, procuring, or searching for abortion services does not constitute a natural person being at risk or danger of death or serious physical injury.

Newsom signed AB 1242 by Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer -Kahan, D- Orinda and SB 107 by Senator Scott Wiener, D -San Francisco, as well as other laws that made California a sanctuary state for abortion services and gender -affirming care. In addition, in the November election, California voters passed a constitutional ame ndment, guaranteeing the right to abortion and contraception. SB 36 would strengthen California's \"Safe Haven\" laws by expanding protections for people who have come to California, including the City and County of San Francisco, to avoid criminal prosecut ion or imprisonment related to that state's criminalization of abortion or gender -affirming care. The bill would also ensure that benefits such as food and housing assistance would not be denied to individuals who left another state and traveled to California for purposes described above but would otherwise be eligible for such benefits. Challenge Since the anti- abortion majority of the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, at least 13 states now have laws on the books making it a felony to re ceive or perform an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In addition, four states have enacted laws or regulations banning gender -affirming care, and 15 additional states are considering legislation to do so, according to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation. 86 Solution/Recommended Proposal The purpose of this bill is to: 1) Prohibit a magistrate from issuing a warrant for the arrest of a bail fugitive whose alleged offense or conviction is for the violation of another state's laws that criminalize abortion, contraception, reproductive care, or gender -affirming care that is otherwise lawful under the laws of this state, regardless of the individual's location; 2) State that it is a misdemeanor for a bail fugitive recovery agent or bail bondsm an to take into custody a bail fugitive whose alleged offense or conviction is for the violation of another state's laws that criminalize abortion, contraception, reproductive care, or genderaffirming care that is otherwise lawful under the laws of this st ate and makes them ineligible for a license to operate in California; 3) Prohibit a state or local law enforcement agency from providing information or assistance to specified entities regarding legally protected health care activity, which includes abortion, contraception, reproductive care, or gender- affirming care that is otherwise lawful under the laws of this state; and, 4) State that a person who is fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody and confinement after conviction, for the above -described acts, is not ineligible for the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program, regardless of the recipient's location.

Skinner, District 9, Democrat Health care services: legally protected health care activities Recommended Position SPONSOR XSUPPORT SUPPORT if amended OPPOSE OTHER & Describe Summary SB 345 expands legal protections for health care professionals providing reproductive health services as well as gender -affirming care, contraception , and abortions for out -of-state patients . Specifically, this bill will protect health care providers from suspension, license revocation, and other related disciplinary actions by a California medical licensing board, due to their performance of legally protected healt h care services regardless of where these services were performed. Additionally, health care providers will be further protected from civil suits or criminal prosecution by non -California jurisdictions due to their performance of health care services, including abortions. Background/Analysis As numerous states across the country continue to criminalize abortion services , and enact significant restriction s on other reproductive health services, California is moving to enact additional legislative s afeguards to protect access to abortion services , as well as provide enhanced protections for health care providers , ensuring that both health care providers, and people seeking reproductive health services, including abortion, are provided with additional criminal and civil protections . Existing Law : (1) Provides for the licensure and regulation of various categories of medical professionals by boards within the Department of Consumer Affairs, including, among others, the Medical Board of California and the Dental Board of California. Existing law makes specified actions by licensed health care providers unprofessional conduct and, in certain cases, a criminal offense. (2) Pursuant to the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, a health care provider , health care service plan, contractor, or corporation are generally prohibit ed from sharing, selling, using for marketing, or otherwise using medical information for a purpose not necessary to provide health care services to the patient. Various obligati ons are imposed 88 on businesses with respect to protecting consumer privacy and information, including requiring certain disclosures to consumers regarding a consumer's rights under the act. (3) Establishes that a law of another state that authorizes a pe rson to bring a civil action against a person or entity that engages in certain activities relating to obtaining or performing an abortion is deemed contrary to CA public policy pursuant to the Reproductive Privacy Act . Application of an out -of-state law described above to a case or controversy in state court or enforcing or satisfying a civil judgment under the out -of- state law is prohibited . (4) Judgment creditor is permitted to apply for the entry of a judgment based on a sister state judgment by filing an application with a superior court and requires the court clerk to enter a judgment based on the application. C ourts are required to grant a stay enforcement of such a judgment under specified circumstances. (5) Murder is defined as the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought. An exemption exists for a person who commits an act that results in the death of a fetus under specific circumstances, including if the act is solicited, aided, abetted, or consented to by the mother of the fetus. (6) Governor must recognize a demand for extradition of a person if the demand meets specified requirements. A magistrate is required, upon the filing of a verified complaint, to issue a warrant directed to any peace officer commanding the officer to apprehend an individual in this state who is convicted, or has violated the terms of bail, probation, or parole, or who is charged with a crime, in another state and who is believed to be in this state. (7) State or local law enforcement agency or officer is prohibited from knowingly arresting or knowingly participating in the arrest of any person for performing, supporting, or aiding in the performance of an abortion or for obtaining an abortion, if the abortion is lawful in this state. Existing law prohibits a state or local public agency from cooperating with or providing information to an individual or agency from another state or a federal law enforcement agency , as specified, regarding a lawful abortion. (8) Terms like \"unborn children\" and \"unborn persons\" are used in various contexts, including, among others, defining low -risk pregnancy conditions for determining the scope of authorization of a certificate to practice nurse -midwifery, defining active labor for health facility licensing provisions, and defining spouse for California State Teachers' Retirement System benefits. (9) The term \"unborn persons\" is used i n various contexts, including naming unknown defendants in real property actions, allowing a court to appoint a guardian ad litem to advocate for inadequa tely represented interests in probate proceedings, allowing a guardian ad litem to give consent on behalf of a beneficiary who lacks legal capacity, and providing an exception for requiring a personal representative to file an account of the distributions of a decedent's estate. Challenge Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, patients are being forced to travel long distances \u2014 often over 500 miles \u2014 to access abortion care in a clinic. Offering medication abortion, which has been shown 89 to be safe and effective, would make it more convenient and accessible to more people . Additionally, by providing enhanced legal protections, this bill would allow California clinicians to help patients in other states who need medication abortion care. While medication abortion is widely used and proven to be safe and effective, more and more states are criminalizing reproductive health care providers and patients, access to this FDA - approved treatment with other services being further restricted every day. Con traception and medication for gender -affirming care are also under attack. Under SB345, someone who has traveled to or resides in Texas could contact a California medical provider and be prescribed abortion medication or contraception. Similarly, a California -based pharmacy would be able to ship the medication to Texas, and both the health care provider and the pharmacy would receive protections, as long as they are in California, from criminal and civil actions initiated in Texas. The same would be true in the case of a person in Florida who contacts a California health care provider for gender -affirming care and a California pharmacy ships the medication. Other states, such as Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Maryland and Vermont are proposing or passing similar laws that expand the ability of medical providers to provide care to patients, regardless of the patient's location. Solution/ Recommended Proposal SB 345 will ensure that California health care practitioners are able to provide essential reproductive and gender -affirming care that is legal in California, regardless of their patient's geographic location, knowing that California is doing everything it can to protect them against the draconian laws of other states. SB 345 w ill expand California's landmark protections in both reproductive health care and gender - affirming care by allowing California health care providers to: Prescribe and dispense medications for abortion and contraception that are safe to patients regardless of where the patient is located ; Provide gender -affirming care and deliver that care regardless of where the patient is located ; and Bring suit in California against anyone who interferes with the health care provider's right to provide care tha t is legal in California. SB 345 would also prohibit any state or local official or contractor from co -operating with any out - of- state investigation into health care that is legally protected in California, including reproductive and gender -affirming care. It would also prevent the extradition of anyone who is in California for receiving or providing legally protected care if the care was initiated in California.
