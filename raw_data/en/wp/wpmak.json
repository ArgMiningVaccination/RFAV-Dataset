Schermerhorn, MD 114 Index 1164 bidmc.org/surgery From the Chair Innovation and discovery occur at the interface of disciplines - where diverse viewpoints interact, problems are examined from different perspectives, and ideas germinate into new solutions to intractable clinical problems. The Department of Surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) is committed to fostering innovation and discovery, by providing a research environment that nurtures intellectual diversity, embraces individual freedom, encourages flexibility, and promotes spontaneity and originality. By embracing these values, we are able to further our mission to develop more effective approaches for the promotion of health, the prevention of illness, and the treatment of disease. The 2018 issue of our Surgery Research Report highlights research that spans from bench to bedside. Our robust research platform has nearly $20 million in funding from the NIH and other federal sources, major philanthropic organizations, and private industry. We conduct laboratory-based investigations that define the molecular basis of disease; develop novel surgical approaches, tools, and devices; and evaluate the effectiveness of clinical interventions on large populations of patients. We also carry out studies that shed light on disparities in the delivery of surgical care or access to treatment for our most vulnerable citizens. This research has international impact. Our faculty and residents have published hundreds of papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Many of our faculty also serve as editors and reviewers for high-impact journals such as JAMA, The New England Journal of Medicine, and Nature - among others. They participate in leading medical and scientific organizations. We are also committed to training and mentoring the next generation of surgeon-investigators - master-surgeons who will change the practice of medicine. We offer both exceptional clinical training in surgery and novel educational opportunities that promote innovative problem finding and problem solving. The individuals whose research is highlighted in this report represent the very best of our department and the medical center. They are dedicated to fulfilling our mission, of serving our communities, improving health through innovation and discovery, and preparing future leaders in American medicine. Elliot L. Chaikof, MD, PhD Johnson and Johnson Professor of Surgery Chair, Department of Surgery Surgeon-in-Chief 5 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportIntroduction In addition to delivering outstanding patient care, translational and clinical research constitutes one of the cornerstones and missions of the Department of Surgery. Research programs in Surgery at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) are focused in five thematic areas - Cancer Biology, Innate and Adaptive Immunity, Regenerative Medicine, Nutrition and Metabolism, and Health Services Research. Important cross cutting platforms include the Center for Drug Discovery, the Harvard Surgical Program in Innovation (SPIN), Surgical Informatics, and the FIRST ( Facilitating Innovative Research and Surgical Trials) program, which supports clinical research and surgical trials. All divisions and nearly all faculty have active translational or clinical research programs. In FY17, over 40 faculty had research programs with dedicated research space, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and surgical residents, as well as research nurses and clinical coordinators. Many of these programs include undergraduates and medical students pursuing research electives and fellowships. Our clinical research initiatives range from clinical trials focused on the development and assessment of new drugs and surgical technology, to health services research focused on the development of effective clinical decision tools, addressing challenges in health inequities and global health, and the novel applications of machine learning and recent innovations in the field of data science. Our faculty are principal investigators of more than 250 open clinical research protocols. Collectively, the common thread that weaves through all of these research projects is the drive to advance scientific discovery and foster the translation of research into clinical practice to improve the health and wellbeing of our patients. In the process, the department has expanded its clinical research mentorship program for faculty, research fellows, and surgical residents. Preparing future leaders in American surgery, who excel as master clinicians, own a question, and embrace the notion of life-long scholarship, remains a core mission of the department. Leadership Research programs in the Department of Surgery are led by Richard R. Cummings, PhD, Vice Chair for Basic and Translational Research, James Rodrigue, PhD, Vice Chair for Clinical Research, and Raul Guzman, MD, Vice Chair for Resident Research. Dr. Cummings is Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, Director of the NIH-funded National Center for Functional Glycomics, and Director of the Harvard Medical School Center for Glycoscience, all based in the department. In addition, he serves as Associate Director of our Center for Drug Discovery and Translational Research. Dr. Rodrigue is Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School and oversees the FIRST program, the Faculty Clinician-Investigator Mentorship Program, and the Clinical Scholarship Program. He also serves as Chair of the Academic Promotions Committee in the Department of Surgery. Dr. Guzman is Associate Professor of Surgery in the Division of Vascular Surgery and an NIH-funded investigator. He oversees resident pre-research advising, resident research mentorship and career development, and our resident and fellow research community. Overview of Surgical Research October 1, 2016 - September 30, 20176 bidmc.org/surgeryResearch Funding The Department of Surgery holds numerous federal awards from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). Grants included a total of 43 federally funded grants and 73 non-federal awards. In addition, the Department faculty were Principle Investigators of two NIH T32 and one NIH T35 training grants. Total research funding was more than $19.3 million dollars in FY17 (Figure 1) with a broad distribution of awards among our divisions (Figure 2).

T32 Training Grants The Department of Surgery continues its longstanding NIH Training Grant in Vascular Biology and Surgery (PI: Frank LoGerfo, MD) and an NIH T35-funded program directed at providing research opportunities for medical students. In addition, we hold an NIH-funded T32 training grant in Inflammation and Trauma (PI: Wolfgang Junger, PhD). Surgical faculty are also participating mentors in the GI Surgery Research Training Grant, which is a joint NIH-funded T32 training grant among the three Harvard Medical School teaching hospitals. Surgical Residents, Post-doctoral Fellows, and Research Clinical Scholarship Program The Clinical Scholarship Program pairs first-year surgery residents with a faculty member who provides mentorship and guidance required for the development of the skills and tools necessary to conduct clinical investigations. Residents are also provided with a one month period for focused advanced study in clinical trial and research design related to their project area in the latter portion of their internship year. Directed by James Rodrigue, PhD, the core objective of the Clinical Scholarship Program is to provide residents with a robust foundation for scholarship early in training and accelerate their development as future leaders in American Surgery. The program also allows residents to develop a mentorship relationship with additional faculty in the department in order to explore potential areas of clinical interest. Within the structure of the Clinical Scholarship Program, residents meet regularly with research mentor(s), participate in research meetings, receive informal and formal feedback from faculty on project proposals, and are provided with focused reading and self-study material. They also attend presentations including topics such as clinical study design, biostatistics, communicating research, ethics, regulatory issues, and grant writing. Residents are expected to prepare, submit, and present their research at the annual Department of Surgery George H. Clowes Surgery Research Day, and at the annual Harvard Medical School Surgery Research Day, as well as submit abstracts for presentations at national and international conferences, and manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Unlike many viral infections, these viruses are not eradicated from the host, but become dormant in the host's tissues for their lifetime. During periods of immune compromise or stress, these viruses can reactivate. It is understood that herpes family viral reactivation is pathologic in immunocompromised people, such as transplant recipients or AIDS patients. My laboratory has been focused on defining the impact that these persistent viral infections have on immune competent hosts. During the past 20 years, we and others have confirmed that these viruses can reactivate during critical illness. Of the family, cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation has been associated with worsened outcomes. My laboratory spent our early years of funding defining mechanisms by which CMV reactivation might be triggered using murine models to test our hypotheses. This transitioned to understanding the consequences of such reactivations; specifically how CMV reactivation might harm an immune competent host. We identified the lungs as a potential target for CMV reactivation, and showed that reactivation is associated with lung injury during bacterial sepsis, something that we named CMV-ALI (cytomegalovirus associated acute lung injury). Clinical outcomes support this hypothesis, with roughly doubled durations of mechanical ventilation required for patients with CMV reactivation. Perhaps most importantly, our work showed that such reactivation events (and their attendant lung injury) can be prevented by antiviral prophylaxis. These results have been foundational to several clinical trials (two completed, one ongoing) that are beginning to corroborate these experimental observations. Our current focus is to try to understand the mechanism of CMV-ALI. CMV infection/ latency makes a lasting imprint in the immunity of its host, leaving CMV-latent hosts with exaggerated immune potential in their lungs. This means that when they encounter bacterial infections (like pneumonia or sepsis) they are more prone to inflammation and lung injury. We are currently evaluating different immune cell populations to understand their individual contributions to CMV-ALI. Our most recent work, done in collaboration with Drs. Carl Hauser, Michael Yaffe, Leo Otterbein, and the HALO group at BIDMC, suggests that neutrophils may play a pivotal role in these exaggerated immune responses. Because we have a robust understanding of CMV biology, and have an animal model, we have been fortunate to develop numerous collaborations with colleagues in overlapping fields. We are currently supported for work with Dr. Antonio Chiocca's group at Brigham and Women's Hospital, studying the interactions between CMV and glioblastoma. Our current results have confirmed a contributory role of CMV to progression of this deadly brain tumor. More importantly, we are defining mechanistic pathways that should lead to novel therapies. We have also begun early collaborations with Dr. Richard Cummings at BIDMC to understand how CMV infection impacts cellular protein glycosylation.29 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-17 Named Chair of Strategic Planning Committee for Surgical Infection Society Invited Lectures: Cost and Consequences of Surgical Infections; 36th Annual Meeting Surgical Infection Society, May 18, 2016 Impact of Latent Herpesviruses on Host Immunity; 14th Annual Advances in Inflammation Research, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence RI, October 6, 2016 Catheter associated blood stream infections: The quest for zero; American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress, San Diego CA, October 24, 2017 Geriatric Injuries: Are rib fractures lethal in the elderly?

Our laboratory is a world leader in investigating the role of intracellular DAMPs derived from mitochondria. Our original work on this subject was published in Nature (March 4, 2010). It has been widely cited as a groundbreaking conceptual advance in sepsis and inflammation research, and has been cited more than 1,000 times. The known mitochondrial DAMPs include mitochondrial DNA, formyl peptides, and some of the mitochondrial lipids. Our recent work has shown that mitochondrial formyl peptides act as potent DAMPs. They circulate in plasma after injury where they activate innate immune cells while simultaneously causing heterologous suppression of cell-surface G-protein coupled receptors for critically important chemoattractants like chemokines and leukotrienes. Mitochondrial DNA is also a potent agonist that targets toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and we have found that it is also a potent activator of neutrophil (PMN) extracellular traps (\"NETs\"). Signaling downstream from this receptor, however, may result in tolerance and so plays a critical role in suppression of immune function after injury. Formyl peptides (FPs) derived from mitochondria are potent chemoattractants. As such, they are critically important activators of immune responses to damaged tissue, including phagocytic wound debridement and thus the initiation of healing. On the other hand, these molecules compete for the immune system's \"attention\" in systemically injured patients. In work presented at the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) we showed that innate responses to FPs released by injury render the host susceptible to infection by suppressing PMN surveillance of the lung after bacterial inoculation. In further work, we have now shown that only five of the 13 native mitochondrial FPs are active at the formyl peptide receptors. Having participated in the development of novel antagonists for the human and mouse formal peptide receptors (FPRs) we are doing studies that use this information to create tools for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Our current work, therefore, centers on modulating inflammation in a way that balances the need for inflammation after injury as an initiator of tissue repair and the susceptibility to infection that systemic inflammation incurs. Molecular aspects of these problems that we study (and which participants can become expert in) include neutrophil signaling, chemokine biology (intracellular calcium flux signaling), the regulation of endothelial permeability in SIRS, and the study of neutrophil NETs. Current investigations and collaborations with external organizations include studies investigating formyl peptide DAMPs in the plasma of trauma and septic patients as well as patients with cancer. We are also studying small peptides that inhibit the formyl peptide receptor family. Current collaborations within the institution include work with my longtime colleague Kiyoshi Itagaki, PhD, and the labs of Leo Otterbein, PhD, and Wolfgang Junger, PhD. Last year, our work on these critical innate immune mechanisms became the foundation of a large Department of Defense focused project award. This programmatic award addresses the role of DAMPs in creating susceptibility of wounded war-fighters to infection. Our multi-PI grant includes work with the laboratories of Leo Otterbein, PhD, Michael Yaffe, MD, PhD, Simon Robson, MD, PhD, James Lederer, PhD, and Danny Talmor, MD. All these are powerhouse on the Longwood campus and have grouped together as the Harvard-Longwood (\"HALO\") consortium for translational biology. This collaborative program uses computational biology to address the interactive rolls of DAMPs like formyl peptides, mitochondrial DNA, heme, (ATP adenosine), reactive oxygen intermediates, complement, with the changing physical-chemical environment of the lung over time to result in altered innate immune cellular phenotypes. These are then permissive of healthcare-acquired pneumonia.31 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-17 Served as Medical Director of Trauma Services, BIDMC Achieved re-verification of BIDMC as an ACS Level 1 Trauma Center Founded the Harvard Longwood (HALO) consortium for translational inflammation biology Distinguished Service Medal for contributions to Military Medicine by the Armed Forces of Columbia Elected Founding Councilor for Clinical Studies, International Association for the Study of Danger Signaling Visiting Professorships and Invited Presentations: Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research Seminars in Basic Science, Danger Signaling After Tissue Injury, Cambridge, MA Plenary lecture, Mitochondrial DAMPS and inflammation, American Transplant Society, Frontiers in Inflammation Relevant to Transplantation Plenary lecture, The biology of surgical site infections, the Surgical Infection Society, Palm Beach, FL Plenary presentation, Application of exogenous PMN to the airway rescues bacterial overgrowth initiated by trauma DAMPs, The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, Waikoloa, HI Invited lecture, Crush injury: Mitochondria matter, The Society of Critical Care Medicine, Critical Care Congress, Honolulu, HI Presidential address, Ownership, The Western Trauma Association, Snowbird, UT AAST Webinar, Danger signaling: An important new principle in trauma and surgical injury Plenary presentation, A subset of five human mitochondrial formyl peptides mimic bacterial peptides and functionally deactivate human neutrophils (PMN), Western Trauma Association, Whistler, BC Scott R.

Under normal circumstances, the released ATP regulates chemotaxis and proliferation of immune cells through autocrine feedback mechanisms that involve ATP and adenosine receptors. These purinergic signaling mechanisms regulate calcium influx and other downstream signaling pathways that are required for proper function of neutrophils and T lymphocytes. However, severe injuries, burns, and infections can cause the release of ATP from inflamed and damaged tissues. This systemic ATP interferes with the autocrine purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate immune cell responses. This results in immune dysfunction that causes clinical complications such as multiple organ failure, immunosuppression, and sepsis. The focus of this laboratory has been to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to these complications. Our work has revealed a complex network of metabolic pathways that regulate ATP release and the purinergic signaling mechanisms that control immune cell functions. This network involves mitochondria that produce the ATP that fuels purinergic signaling. Thus, mitochondria are the link between the metabolic and calcium signaling events and the purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate immune cell functions. We found that mitochondrial function in T cells is reduced in critical care patients and that impaired mitochondrial ATP production is directly correlated with the severity of sepsis. Our studies suggest that pharmacological targeting of purinergic signaling is a promising new approach to restore immune competence in critical care and trauma patients. 33 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.

We study specific signaling pathways in the cell that respond to stress, DNA damage, and inflammatory cytokines, and use experimental and computational tools to understand and how these pathways are biochemically wired, and how the outputs of these pathways are integrated at the molecular and systems level to control the subsequent fate of the stressed and damaged cells. We are particularly interested in cross-talk between (1) stress, inflammation and immune function after trauma, (2) stress, inflammation, innate immune function and cancer, and (3) targeting stress, DNA damage, and cell cycle control pathways for cancer treatment. Our lab has a longstanding interest in inventing new technologies to address these questions including novel proteomic methods, high-throughput signaling assays and peptide library screens, RNAi screens using high-content imaging, and novel computational/ bioinformatics methods, together with more traditional techniques from cell biology, physical biochemistry, structural biology, and mouse genetics. Signaling pathways and networks that control the DNA damage response, cell cycle progression and cancer When cells encounter stress or injury such as DNA damage, they activate complex signaling networks that regulate their ability to recover, repair the damage, and return to a homeostatic equilibrium. These networks must integrate a wide variety of signals from inside and outside the cell, transduced through protein kinase and lipid signaling pathways, to ultimately control cell cycle arrest or progression, coordinately regulate specific patterns of gene expression, and/or initiate senescence or cell death. Mutations in, or dysfunction of, protein kinase signaling pathways that normally respond to DNA damage, for example, play critical roles in tumor development and progression, while intentional targeting of these pathways can enhance the ability of commonly used DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiation to cure cancer. We have been attacking this research area along two fronts: 1) characterizing the molecular details of the DNA damage response with a focus on protein kinases, phospho-binding domains, RNA-binding proteins, and epigenetic modulation of chromatin at the site of damage, and 2) examining whether cross-talk between various signaling pathways and the DNA damage-response can be pharmacologically manipulated to enhance the response of tumors to DNA damaging agents alone, or in combination with immunotherapy. We showed, for example, that p53-defective tumor cells become dependent on signaling through the stress-activated p38-MK2 pathway to resist killing by chemotherapy, and have now created a variety of standard and novel conditional MK2 knock-out mice, as well as nanoparticles delivering MK2-targeted RNAi and CRISPR, to target this pathway in vivo in several cancer models. We are continuing to explore the roles of the MK2 pathway in a variety of cancer-relevant phenotypes, as well as performing CRISPR-based screens to look for new modifiers of the DNA damage response that can be therapeutically targeted. This work has led to a new focus on the role of RNA-binding proteins as critical integrators of stress and DNA damage response pathways in the cell. Finally, we discovered the phenomenon of 'dynamic network re-wiring,' in which tumor cell treatment with a specific schedule of signaling pathway inhibitors and DNA-damaging chemotherapy can be used to dramatically enhance cell killing in a subset of triple-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. We are now trialing this approach in human PDX models of TNBC, in collaboration with Dr. Gerburg Wulf (Hematology-Oncology, BIDMC), as well as extending that work into colon, head and neck, and prostate cancer models.35 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.Signaling pathways and networks that control cytokine responses and inflammation Misregulation of cytokine feedback loops, along with inappropriate activation of the blood clotting cascade causes dysregulation of cell signaling pathways in innate immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages), resulting in tissue damage and multiple organ failure following trauma or sepsis. Our research is focused on understanding the role of the p38-MK2 pathway in cytokine control and innate immune function, and on cross-talk between cytokines, clotting factors, and neutrophil NADPH oxidase-derived ROS in tissue damage, coagulopathy, and inflammation, using biochemistry, cell biology, and mouse knock-out/knock-in models. We recently discovered a particularly important link between abnormal blood clotting and the complement pathway cytokine C5a which causes excessive production of extracellular ROS and organ damage by neutrophils after traumatic injury.

Ginsburg Associate Professor of Surgery Chief, Cardiac Surgery RESEARCH FOCUS The Valve Research Group primarily investigates the dynamic behavior of heart valves in both normal and pathologic states. Heart valves are complex 3-dimensional (3D) structures that undergo dynamic changes during the cardiac cycle. Investigating this behavior is of critical importance in understanding the pathophysiology of and devising management strategies for valvular disease. Together with Dr. Feroze Mahmood and a multidisciplinary Valve Research Group, normal and abnormal size, shape, and geometric parameters pertaining to the mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valves are being researched. In addition, we are studying the impact different surgical interventions (e.g., aortic valve replacement and mitral annuloplasty) have on native valve function and surrounding anatomy. To accomplish this, we analyze 3D echocardiographic data using commercially available software, including Philips Qlab and TomTec Image Arena. These software programs enable us to dynamically track and measure anatomical changes in a clinically feasible fashion. We are currently in the process of extending similar analyses to normal and pathologic tricuspid valves, leading to a more robust understanding of tricuspid valve behavior. Investigations are also underway to investigate the in vivo effects of different annuloplasty devices on dynamic valve motion and geometry. These data and analyses hold significant potential in furthering the evidence base for valve repair strategies and surgical decision- making toward achieving the best outcomes. The multidisciplinary Valve Research Group is involved with multiple national and international universities, engaged in devising new methods of interrogating valvular structures using 3D echocardiography. We are continuing our collaboration with Cardiology and Vascular and Endovascular Surgery on multiple projects including clinical trials, which include the following: Multi-Center Experience with the Rapid Deployment EDWARDS INTUITY Valve System For Aortic Valve ReplaceMent (TRANSFORM Trial, Protocol Number 2011-02): The purpose of this clinical investigation is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the investigational EDWARDS INTUITY Valve System in subjects with aortic stenosis or stenosis-insufficiency requiring replacement of the native aortic valve.

Studies completed so far have shown promising results. The results of one study demonstrate that left-ventricular outflow tract area is signicantly underestimated by two-dimensional (2D) measurements when compared with 3D data. This underestimation of the LVOT area with 2D echocardiography potentially overestimates the degree of aortic stenosis (AS). Such errors in assessing disease severity can have important clinical consequences vis-\u00e0-vis the decision to operate vs. not operate. In another study, we report that the implantation of prosthetic valves in the aortic position is associated with changes in dynamic mitral annular geometry. Earlier, our understanding of the effects of aortic valve replacement was limited to geometric analyses of mitral annular conformation at a single point in the cardiac cycle (end-systole). We have also successfully demonstrated the use of 3D echocardiography in analyzing mitral valve geometry in patients with functional mitral valve regurgitation (FMR). Previously, the understanding of annular dynamics in FMR was largely limited to information derived from animal models. The Valve Research Group has been recognized and granted the status of hospital \"core laboratory\" for 3D printing establishing a state-of-the-art 3D printing laboratory. Additionally multiple echocardiography simulators serve as a dedicated simulation laboratory.SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Mahmood F, Matyal R, echocar - diographic Cardiothorac Anesth KR.

We are particularly interested in complex regulatory aspects that go beyond homeostasis and the hypothalamus. It is now established that the interplay between brain regions related to reward processing and those that support complex aspects of cognition, such as executive functions, play a critical role in human eating behavior and obesity. This emerging neuro - cognitive model can help identify new targets to accelerate the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for obesity. Our research combines nutrition, psychology and clinical measures with cutting-edge noninvasive cognitive neuroscience tools, such as computerized testing, functional neuroimaging and neurotechnologies. Our laboratory has two main goals. First, we want to understand the neurocognitive basis of human nutrition, eating behavior and obesity. Second, we want to develop innovative applications and tools derived from this research for quantitative assessment, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Ongoing research includes: Development of new methodologies to study the neurocognitive basis of human eating behavior The study of human eating behavior has typically relied on self-report measures and the use of restricted experimental settings that do not capture the complexity of food choices and the situational component that we face when confronted with food. We are developing a methodological platform to simultaneously monitor and evaluate neural, cognitive, and behavioral measures during a meal conducted in a semi-naturalistic setting. This method integrates electroencephalography and portable eye-tracking together with behavioral and nutritional assessments. Potential applications include precision phenotyping of individuals and early evaluation of interventions. Additionally, we have developed a programmable computerized meal table with capabilities to sense and display information during the course of a meal. This novel tool fills a gap in the field as it allows experimental manipulation of the meal with an unprecedented level of possibilities. In addition to meal-related methodologies, we have also developed computerized tests to assess cognitive domains related to food. These tasks are being used by local, national, and international research teams. Application of noninvasive neuromodulation for obesity therapeutics We continue to conduct research studies examining the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients with obesity. Following the report of weight loss with anodal tDCS over the left prefrontal cortex (Gluck, Alonso-Alonso et al. Obesity 2015) we have continued working in the same direction to try to replicate and extend the findings. Interest for the use of tDCS in obesity has grown substantially in the past two years and, as a result, we have established a network of international research collaborations in this area to conduct clinical trials to accelerate and scale data collection. Ongoing studies are exploring new targets, such as the role of prefronto-cerebellar connections in appetite, the effects of lateral occipital region in food-specific attention, and genetic influences in the response to tDCS. Look AHEAD Extension trial I am a Co-Investigator of the NIH-NIDDK Look AHEAD Extension trial, responsible for the BIDMC portion of the Boston site.

Callery, MD, FACS Professor of Surgery Chief, General Surgery RESEARCH FOCUS Clinical outcomes research in pancreaticobiliary surgery Our group's work focuses on outcomes research in high-acuity pancreaticobiliary surgery. Fueled by a robust clinical practice that focuses on treatment of pancreatic malignancies, cystic lesions, pancreatitis, and complex biliary conditions in a multidisciplinary setting, we perform more than 200 major pancreaticobiliary operations per year. A prospective database of more than 4,000 operations and 750 pancreatic resections has been developed and maintained from this practice, providing the substrate for our investigations. Areas of emphasis are the development and critical analysis of clinical pathways and other systems initiatives for optimal patient care. Separate investigations are centered on technical and perioperative management aspects of surgical care for diseases of the pancreas and biliary tree. We have also explored the impact of surgical complications associated with pancreatic operations, especially the Whipple procedure. We continue to assess and develop metrics for quality assessment in high acuity surgery especially as aligned with quality of life measures and risk mitigation strategies. Additional recent efforts have included investigations into readmission after pancreatectomy with goals of understanding how and why they occur, and when and when not readmissions can be avoided. Our original description of the Fistula Risk Score (FRS) for pancreatectomy has been embraced worldwide for daily clinical use. As part of a national and international pancreatectomy research consortium, we have participated in its validation nationally and internationally, and proud of its validation at many high-volume pancreatic surgery centers across the USA. Our consortium also has evaluated the FRS in terms of economic impact, quality and detailed manners of risk mitigation. Other outcomes studies over the last year have involved the investigation of the relationship between pancreatectomy for cancer, complications, and initiation/completion of adjuvant therapy, and the analysis of outcomes for patients undergoing palliative surgery in the setting of pancreatic cancer. Work is also ongoing to develop, employ, and evaluate a patient-education tool to provide additional and improved information to patients upon discharge after pancreatectomy. The effectiveness of this tool will be evaluated via patient- satisfaction surveys and readmission rate/cause assessment.43 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION I have taught medical students, residents, and fellow physicians in many settings for over 20 years.

Hagen, PhD Associate Professor of Surgery Associate Vice-Chair for Research RESEARCH GROUP Lay-Hong Ang, PhD Tyler Caron, DVM Aniket Gad, MS Salih Karahan Yue Li, PhD Lena Liu Kathleen Scott, DVM Kyle Smith Suzanne WhiteRESEARCH FOCUS The focus of my laboratory is to understand how barrier dysfunction facilitates gastric cancer development during Helicobacter pylori infection. We approach our work by studying the details of gastric barrier function in general, and its disruption during infection and cancer development using genetic, advanced microscopy, and genomic approaches. Our aims have two important goals: one is to understand basic science principles and the other is translational. Although the stomach expresses a specific subset of claudin molecules, which are proteins that confer barrier properties to epithelial cells at the tight junction, it highly expresses one particular claudin, claudin-18 (CLDN18). CLDN18 is a cation-specific tight junction protein that is transcriptionally down-regulated in H. pylori infection in mice as well as in human patients with gastric cancer. Because CLDN18 protein and its gene, CLDN18, are attenuated in disease, we made CLDN18 knockout mice to study its role in mucosal barrier function in general and in gastric cancer pathogenesis in particular. Our recent work demonstrates that CLDN18: 1) is not tight junction associated but is rather a basolateral membrane protein (Figure 1). This work was done using super-resolution microscopy techniques by Dr. Ang; 2) is an important signaling molecule that regulates gastric homeostasis; and 3) is a potent tumor suppressor in the stomach. We recently demonstrated that knockout of CLDN18 promotes rapid gastric cancer development. Due to these results, we created two gastric cell-specific conditional knockout mouse lines to genetically dissect the role of CLDN18 in gastric tumorigenesis. We complement the animal studies with in vitro work using primary cultured gastric epithelial cells that contain nearly pure parietal or chief cells, or gastric organoids. We have work in progress to evaluate the role of cytokines in down-regulation of CLDN18 using the reductionist models, with the hypothesis that interleukin-1beta down- regulates CLDN18, leading to gastric cancer development (Figure 2). With collaborators, we also use human pathology samples from gastritis through gastric cancer to evaluate gene-expression patterns for novel biomarkers related to CLDN18 that may inform patient management, drive biomarker development for early screening, and/or uncover therapeutic opportunities for novel drug development targeting gastric cancer. A second project in the lab involves a close collaboration with Dr. David Cohen, Chief of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Weil Cornell in New York, to study the role of thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1) in hepatic steatosis/NAFDL. We became involved with this project due to our expertise in microscopy, specifically in correlative light (LM) and electron (EM) microscopy. Using adipocytes in culture, we have shown that Them1 associates with glycogen. As metabolism is stimulated, PKC activation via a distinct pathway changes the localization of Them1/glycogen. We are currently working to understand the physiological consequences of the Them1/glycogen interaction and rearrangement after stimulation. For this project, we have been using the new High Pressure Freezer, transfecting cells and expressing EGFP for confocal (LM) and APEXII for EM, and have been using the biotin-labeling technique with APEXII to determine in vivo binding partners for Them1. FIGURE 1: CLDN18 is not tight junction associated, but is rather a basolateral membrane protein.

Using group video trainers, we demonstrated for the first time in Surgery that intense skills training improved operative performance. Computer trainers which provided immediate feedback further improved trainees' ability to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Other simulators included novel models for laparoscopic hernia repair, common bile duct exploration, and ultrasound-guided breast biopsy. Studies demonstrated error with sleep deprivation among post-call surgical residents. Furthermore, programs for medical students suggest the benefit from early exposure to simulation. Simulation/Education There are six ongoing R01 NIH-funded collaborative projects among the Center for Modeling, Simulation and Imaging in Medicine (CeMSIM), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), the Carl J. Shapiro Simulation and Skills Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), and Tufts University: Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skills Trainer (VBLaST) is a virtual reality trainer that replicates the FLS tasks for skills training. In this project, a specialized interface with haptic feedback was to replicate the FLS box for the VBLaST. Validation studies are conducted at the Carl J. Shapiro Simulation and Skills Center. Virtual Natural Orifice Transluminal EndoScopic Surgery (VR-NOTES) simulator provides a training and testing platform for both transgastric and transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy. Currently the VR-NOTES simulator has virtual organ models through which a fly-through simulation can be done along the predetermined path for a transgastric approach. A haptic interface with a realistic flexible endoscope is being developed to interact with the VR-NOTES simulator. Generation (Gen) 2 Cognitive Simulator seeks to create a Star Trek hallodeck experience by creating an environment as close to real surgery as possible, including the operating room environment, devices, avatars, and room noises, making the training very realistic. Virtual Electrosurgery Trainer (VEST) is an ongoing project that includes basic modules to teach ways to avoid patient injury during an electrosurgery procedure. The VEST can simulate insulation failure, capacitive and direct coupling. An interface with two ports for trocar and tool placement whose motion are captured by optical and gyroscope sensors was built to interface the VEST for testing. Virtual Airway Simulation Trainer (VAST) develops a simulator to teach difficult airway as might be encountered in an obese patient. Critcothroidotomy is also taught. Virtual Endoluminal Surgery Simulator (VESS) is used to teach advanced therapeutic endoscopy for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Other funding from the CRICO-RMF has supported our project, FUSE: Catalysts and barriers to implementation and quality initiative in the OR. We studied the adoption of the SAGES Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy in an online educational curriculum. Bariatric Surgery My research also focuses on the clinical outcomes. In collaboration with Christina Wee, MD, MPH (Department of Medicine, BIDMC) we have a large database from which we have published this year on the following topics: expectations for weight loss and willingness to accept risk, quality of life among obese patients, obesity-related stigmata and functional status, patient factors associated with undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and high-risk alcohol use after weight loss surgery. This research is funded by the NIH. In collaboration with Brown University we are funded by the NIH to better understand how we can use technology to help our bariatric surgery patients with lifestyle changes. In addition, I am PI for an NIH study, Ecological momentary assessment of behavioral and psychosocial predictors of weight loss following bariatric surgery.

In addition, we have utilized national large databases as well. Areas of emphasis are investigation into the transition from inpatient to post-discharge care, readmission rates, and prediction of post-discharge needs. Based on earlier work, we developed a discharge informational tool for patients and we are currently evaluating its utility after pancreatectomy. Recent efforts have focused on investigation of the means by which patients process information about their pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment options, with a goal of improving patient understanding of, and contribution to, their care. We have assessed the readability, accuracy, and suitability of available online information on pancreatic cancer, the communication between the care team and patients and families, and the use of health literacy assessments. We are now investigating the relationship between designated language and time to definitive treatment. We are currently developing a process to assess health literacy and cultural expectations in patients with new pancreas cancer diagnoses, in order to evaluate the impact of these factors on patient progression to care. Surgical education research Our surgical education research effort includes the study of factors influencing in-training exam scores, including the impact of a modified style of curriculum delivery. Other recent efforts have included: a study of resident confidence after completion of an intern-level practical skills curriculum, and the development of a structured face-to-face clinical assessment for interns. In addition, with support from a Shapiro Institute grant, we developed and evaluated a curriculum on the learning environment and mistreatment. Currently, we are working to modify this curriculum for the faculty. Additionally, we are involved in the development of a multicenter study of the impact of a curriculum on cultural dexterity, for which NIH funding is pending.49 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 Chair, Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (AHPBA) Education and Training Committee, as of 2016 Certificate, Applied Biostatistics, Harvard Catalyst: Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center, 2017 Editorial Board member, Journal of Surgical Education, as of 2017 Promoted to Associate Professor of Surgery, 2017SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Watkins AA, Bliss LA, Cameron DB, Tseng TS.

My laboratory has focused on evaluating the efficacy and safety of several bioactive natural compounds on the growth, progression, and metastasis of certain types of cancer in both in vitro and in vivo model systems, and investigating the mechanisms of action of these bioactive components. Since cancer stem cells are recognized to be responsible for drug resistance and metastasis of cancer, our special effort has been in identifying bioactive components for targeting cancer stem cells. Additionally, we have investigated the effects of bioactive components on blood glucose management, alleviation of chronic kidney disease, and prevention of autism. In the past year, my laboratory has focused on the following projects. Tanshinones as potent anti-cancer and anti-cancer stem cell agents by targeting Aurora A and B kinases Our studies have shown that tanshinones, which anti-proliferation and anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewal activities against several types of cancer cell lines. Further investigations showed that, among these tanshinones, T1 had the most potent activities and inhibited the growth of prostate tumors and lung tumors in animal models, with minimal side effects. Further mechanism studies demonstrated that downregulation of Aurora A and B kinases was an important mechanism shared by all three tanshinones. To further improve the anti-cancer activities of bioactive agents with additive and/or synergistic combination, our studies showed that the combination between CT and T1 or T2A had synergistic effect against prostate cancer in part via downregulation of aurora kinases, whereas the combination of T1 and T2A had an antagonistic effect associated with upregulation of aurora kinases. Our other studies also showed that T1 and resveratrol combination had a synergistic effect on inhibiting prostate cancer, in part via downregulation expression of aurora A and c-myc in a combined manner. We are in the processing to verify the efficacy of these synergistic combination regimens in clinically relevant animal models of cancer. Bioactive components delay the development and progression of chronic kidney injury by inhibiting inflammation We have also studied the effects of bioactive components, activated lactic acid (ALA), and a soy germ extract (SGE), on chronic kidney disease in vitro and in vivo. Both ALA and SGE showed anti-inflammatory and oxidative stress-suppressing activities in kidney cell models in vitro. Further in vivo study also showed the preventive efficacy of ALA or SGE on an adenine-induced chronic kidney injury animal model by inhibiting inflammation and reducing toxicity in the kidney that was associated with modulating inflammation biomarkers in blood and kidney samples. Additionally, these bioactive components had minimal side effect in vivo, supporting that these bioactive components may warrant further investigation for potential clinical application. Anti-inflammatory effect of bioactive components for prevention of autism In this research project, we have successfully established the iPSC-differentiated neuronal and astrocitic cell models for identifying active components and for mechanism studies. Our studies showed that autistic iPSC-derived astrocytes had significantly increased inflammation levels, compared with that of the normal controls. Using this novel cell model, we have identified several candidate bioactive agents that showed potent anti-inflammation activities in astrocytes. We are in the process of further verifying the in vivo efficacy to elucidate mechanisms of action of bioactive agents.51 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Wang S, Shen P, Zhou J, Lu Y.

Stackhouse, MD Kathrin Stavenhagen, PhD Xiaodong Sun, PhD Mohui Wei, PhD Junwei Zeng, PhDRESEARCH FOCUS A key quest of my research during the past 35 years has been to understand the structure and function of glycoconjugates in cell adhesion and signaling, studying the molecular and biochemical functions of surface and secreted glycoproteins in normal biological processes and disease. We study the molecular nature and specificity of protein-glycan interactions and their roles in biology, and how glycans are recognized by glycan-binding proteins (GBPs). My laboratory has been instrumental in developing new technologies in glycoscience, discovering novel functions of glycans in immune recognition and modulation, viral (influenza), parasitic (helminth) and bacterial infections, cell adhesion, selectin biology and leukocyte trafficking, new enzymes and molecular chaperones that regulate protein glycosylation, and educating students in the field of glycoscience. Early work in our laboratory established the identities and specificities of many glycosyltransferases and glycan-binding proteins and plant lectins. In our translational studies, we are exploring glycoimmunology, and the roles of adaptive and innate immune responses to pathogens, as well as human diseases that are both heritable and acquired, and which involve altered glycosylation. We have developed novel techniques in the field for glycan analysis and for exploring the structure/function relationships of glycans, using genetic/molecular approaches, biophysical and biochemical strategies, and multiple glycan microarray and glycan bead strategies. We are also developing semi-synthetic methods for making glycoconjugates and for isolating, characterizing, and derivatizing glycans. Such technologies are revolutionary and are growing at a rapid pace; thus, I expect such microarray (and flow cytometry-based arrays) to be a major contributor to the field of glycoscience going forward. I hold numerous patents in the field of glycoscience. My laboratory is the headquarters of the National Center for Functional Glycomics (NCFG), of which I am the Director, and the Protein-Glycan Interaction Resource of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), of which I am the Chair, and offers glycan microarray services to hundreds of laboratories worldwide. We also have a strong effort in promoting and developing bioinformatics and databases related to glycoscience. My laboratory and the NCFG moved to Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in the fall of 2015, where I have founded and was appointed Director of the new Harvard Medical School Center for Glycoscience. My research goals are centered on identifying the structures, functions and biosynthesis of complex glycoconjugates in a variety of normal and pathologic biological processes.

My laboratory has studied the optimal integration of molecular simulations into the generation of bioactive molecules. In collaboration with investigators at Harvard Medical School, we have applied this research methodology for the discovery of novel inhibitors of the protein- protein interaction (PPI) between interleukin (IL)-18 and its (collaborator: Dr. Bruce Zetter, Boston Children's Hospital), the cell cycle modulators as cytotoxic agents in drug resistant cancer cells (collaborator: Dr. Barbara Wegiel, BIDMC), the (collaborator: Dr. Elliot Chaikof, BIDMC). IL-18 plays a significant role in driving the inflammatory processes responsible for the development of intimal hyperplasia (IH). Via molecular simulation and in silico screening, we recently identified small molecule compounds that inhibit IL-18 signaling with low micromolar potency. Preliminary data suggest the small molecules elicit IL-18 antagonistic activity by inhibiting the PPI between IL-18 and its receptor. We are actively engaged in the characterization and improvement of the novel inhibitors. Overly activated mast cells are implicated in the pathology of a number of diseases, including diabetic neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcer. Mast cell activation and the release of a spectrum of proinflammatory mediators are controlled by calcium channels. We have synthesized a new class of calcium channel blockers that effectively inhibit channel function and mast cell degranulation. We have demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of diabetic wound healing and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In the ACL project, we showed that ACL inhibitors reduced the population of the cancer stem-like cells (CSC) in a lung cancer cell line (A549) and an engineered breast cell line. The ACL inhibitors also inhibited the tumorigenesis in 3D in vitro tumorsphere assays. Research by others has recently showed a role of ACL in directing the polarization of the M2 phenotype macrophages that in the tumor microenvironment promote cancer immune escape. Our hypothesis is that inhibition of ACL might offer a unique approach to eradicate cancer cells by simultaneously reducing CSC and immune suppression in tumors. We are currently characterizing novel ATP-competitive ACL inhibitors that interrupt the rate-limiting step of the enzymatic reaction. IDO and TDO are promising drug targets in immuno-oncology. Via in silico screen of compound library, we have identified IDO or TDO selective inhibitors that belong to different chemical scaffolds from all the reported inhibitors. The in vitro activity of the initial screening hits in biochemical assays is improved by conducting lead optimization studies. CLKs are a class of kinases that regulate the alternative splicing of messenger RNA and are considered attractive drug targets for cancer as well as neurodegenerative disorders. We have discovered a class of benzimidazoles as highly selectively CLK inhibitors that inhibited cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Structure-activity relationship study is currently one focus of our research.55 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 We have successfully established a number of collaborative research programs that are supported by extramural funding provided by a federal agency or by other sources. Our research has started to bear fruit in a number of dimensions. In addition to the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge (including eight peer-reviewed publications), one major objective of our center is to promote technological and therapeutic innovations that address highly unmet patients needs. One of the technologies invented in our laboratory was licensed by a venture capital firm, which formed the cornerstone platform technology in a biotech startup focusing on the discovery and development of novel anticancer and anti-inflammatory therapies. Further, we are in active discussions for multiple funding or licensing opportunities to advance our innovations toward improving patient care. Thus far, we have filed four U.S. provisional patent applications, and have planned to submit multiple additional applications, based on the inventions from our center: Substance P, Mast Cell Degranulation Inhibitors and Peripheral Neuropathy.

In addition, we also provided internship opportunities for high school graduates who would enter colleges for higher education in basic and biological science. On numerous occasions, I have provided technical expertise to research fellows from collaborators' laboratories, guided their study designs, and made impactful influence in their scientific development and professional careers. I am inspired by the success of the talented fellows and motivated to transform the center to become a platform of excellence for training and biomedical innovation.SELECTED RESEARCH SUPPORT Development of Small Molecule Inhibitors of IL-18 to Prevent Intimal Hyperplasia; Pradhan- Nabzdyk, Targeting activated mast cells Joslin DRC F&P Award, 2015-2019; PhD)56 bidmc.org/surgery Jeffrey Arle, MD, PhD Associate Professor of Surgery Associate Chief, Neurosurgery RESEARCH GROUP Kristen Carlson LZ Mei, MS Jay Shils, PhDRESEARCH FOCUS Our research efforts have focused on computational modeling of neural stimulation and circuitry related to devices and therapies used in neuromodulation. These therapies include deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), motor cortex stimulation (MCS), and other related aspects of neural processing. Modeling has included circuitry models of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease and the DBS electrode in a discrete solution, M1 and S1 regions of cortex with cortico-thalamic processing, three-dimensional modeling of the activating function and fibers of passage, and patterns of stimulation and power in tremor control. More recently, we have focused on mechanisms of action to treat chronic pain using high frequency and burst type spinal cord stimulation as well as work showing how computational models of neural circuitry can be used to help streamline new drug development in major depressive disorder. We have also worked on a new analysis of theoretical changes in information processing in axons of passage through regions using deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease and other disorders. Our work has been presented this past year at the International Neuromodulation Society meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland, the Neuromodulation Society of New Zealand and Australia in Adelaide, Australia, the International Society of Intraoperative Neurophysiology in Seoul, South Korea, the North American Neuromodulation Society meeting in Las Vegas, NV, and the Spine Intervention Society meeting in San Francisco, CA. In these recent efforts, we have further developed and refined our hypothesis on how high frequency stimulation systems modulate axons, both in suppressing or blocking them as well as in stimulating them. We continue to examine the fundamental mechanisms of neuromodulation therapies, an area of rapidly developing technology and innovation.

We have accumulated one of the largest experiences with flow diverter technology in the world and have been able to add substantially to understanding of the safety and efficacy of this device. Our publications in peer reviewed literature, which number about 25 this past year, are a reflection of this growing practice. Anticoagulation regimens For endovascular techniques, we have investigated the type of anticoagulation needed to enhance the safety of device delivery. We examined data from our own institution as well as a number of collaborative multi-institutional studies in an attempt to refine the antiplatelet agent regimens and radiographic follow-up for these individuals. We have documented that almost 30% of patients who are non-responders to Clopidogrel warrant treatment with Ticagrelor. By altering these patients' antiplatelet regimen, stroke rates can be reduced dramatically when using intravascular flow diversion. Management of Dural AV Fistulas We have developed significant expertise in the management of both cranial and spinal dural AV fistulas. As part of this effort, we have introduced a new classification system for cavernous carotid fistulas based on venous drainage to guide treatment and prognosis. Subarachnoid hemorrhage We have also hypothesized that anti-angiogenic factors, such as soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and soluble transforming growth factor co-receptor endoglin, are important contributors to the pathophysiology of delayed cerebral ischemia. Analysis of CSF from subarachnoid hemorrhage patients seems to confirm this hypothesis. The findings were published in World Neursourgery. Aneurysm Recanalization Stratification Scale We have developed the Stratification Scale, which uses accessible predictors including aneurysm- specific factors (size, rupture, and intraluminal thrombosis) and treatment-related features (treatment modality and immediate angiographic result) to predict retreatment risk after endovascular therapy. Technological and Other Scientific Innovations In collaboration with Conor Walsh, PhD, at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Dr. Thomas designed a hand-held, portable cranial drilling device that can be used with any diameter drill bit to create holes in the skull without endangering underlying brain tissue. The drill will make it safer for neurosurgeons to penetrate the skull for smaller probes such as intracranial pressure monitors. It will allow healthcare professionals in allied specialties, such as trauma surgery, to place intracranial monitors safely. This project received the 2011 Excellence in Medical Device Design Award from SEAS. Basic Science In the laboratory, in collaboration with Christiane Ferran, MD, PhD, Dr. Thomas has been exploring the hypothesis that some of the limitations surrounding neural stem cell 59 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.transplantation can be overcome by the addition of periventricular endothelial cells (PvEC) from the embryonic brain. This novel concept is the outgrowth of several recent studies in the area of angiogenesis and neurogenesis, where it is postulated that PvECs migrate in the embryonic brain in a similar manner to neurons, and have a reciprocal relationship in the development of neuronal networks and the vasculature that supports them. Dr. Thomas' project involves characterizing the molecular interactions between neural precursor cells and embryonic derived mouse brain periventricular endothelial cells to show enhanced bidirectional effects on neurogenesis and vasculogenesis. This understanding will inform the optimal conditions for transplanting an appropriate combination of these cells within a mouse focal ischemia model. Publications have resulted from this collaboration, with more in the process.

Surgical Techniques Endoscopic visualization of the peripheral retina and ciliary body is a valuable tool in vitreoretinal surgery. We are currently conducting two retrospective case series to evaluate the use of endoscopy in (1) ciliary body membrane peeling for patients with ocular hypotony and (2) pars plana vitrectomy with retinal detachments complicated by severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Our data suggest that while use of the endoscope increases surgical duration, endoscopic vitreoretinal visualization aids in therapeutic and preventative maneuvers, and limits the use of additional intraoperative supplies. Hypotony is a relatively common postoperative complication for which treatment, either by pharmacologic or surgical means, remains challenging. Our preliminary data suggest that endoscopy-assisted ciliary body membrane peeling has favorable effects in increasing intraocular pressure and stabilizing visual acuity in eyes with chronic hypotony after surgical retinal detachment repair. We have also identified several factors that are correlated with favorable visual and anatomical prognosis following ciliary body membrane peeling. Vitreomacular Traction: Treatment and Imaging strong vitreous and retina cause tugging of the retina as the vitreous contracts, resulting in distortion of the neurosensory retina, which can lead to vision loss. We conducted a retrospective case series to compare all available treatment options for patients diagnosed with VMT. We also performed a meta-analysis of published literature to assess the rate of VMT resolution among patients who received one of three options: a control injection of saline, intravitreal ocriplasmin (IVO), vitreolysis (PV, the intravitreal injection of an expansile gas with intermittent face down positioning). Our case series confirmed that pars plana vitrectomy has the highest efficacy in treating VMT, as compared with the other nonsurgical options. Both our case series and meta-analysis showed that PV had a higher rate of VMT resolution compared with IVO at Day 28 post- treatment. We also published a case report describing a patient with resistant VMT successfully treated with an intravitreal injection of a lower dose of ocriplasmin and a residual intravitreal gas bubble from pneumatic vitreolysis. Our report showed the efficacy of combining the mechanical forces of PV with the enzymatic fibrinolytic activity available in a lower dose of ocriplasmin to treat resistant VMT cases, non-invasively. We have also conducted a study to investigate the value of imaging via spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in predicting changes in acuity following successful treatment for VMT. Our results show that recovery of the cone outer segment tips (COST) line and inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) line defects as observed by SD-OCT is positively correlated with visual acuity improvement after successful VMT treatment.61 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 Presentations In May 2017, our research team attended the annual meeting for the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) in Baltimore. We presented our work on endoscopy-assisted retinectomy for complex retinal detachments as well as our findings regarding the capacity of SD-OCT to predict visual outcomes following surgery for VMT. In 2017, I also presented our findings on macular hole formation following pneumatic vitreolysis for vitreomacular traction at the Retina Society and the Macula Society. Ongoing Projects Consistent with our interest in studying novel treatments for vitreomacular traction (VMT), we are currently investigating the efficacy of pneumatic vitreolysis (PV) for symptomatic VMT in eyes with and without macular holes. In our current case series, we have found that PV successfully released VMT in all eyes with early or full thickness macular holes (FTMH). However, MH closure was not achieved in any eyes with full thickness MH following PV alone. Our preliminary analysis suggests that foveal thinning is a risk factor for the development of FTMH and that PV alone may be ineffective in treating cases of VMT associated with FTMH. We have continued to utilize our database of nearly 20 years of clinical and surgical data from the BIDMC retina service to compare treatments and study outcomes and predictive factors for various retinal conditions. We are currently conducting a retrospective comparison of outcomes following different types of retinal detachment repair, including pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckle with and without vitrectomy, and pneumatic retinopexy. We are also examining long-term visual and anatomical outcomes of choroidal detachment repair in a small case series. In addition, we are investigating the association between the condition of the posterior vitreous, classified as one of five stages, and postoperative measures following vitrectomy for ocular complications associated with diabetes.SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Yu G, Sun P, Van Zyl T, Tandias R, Arroyo JG.

Bouffard, MD Edsel Ing, MDRESEARCH FOCUS My research in 2016-2017 focused on investigating newer non-invasive tests for giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is the most common vasculitis of the elderly and causes irreversible blindness in up to 20 percent of patients. GCA can be a diagnostic conundrum when it presents in an atypical or occult fashion. There is no highly specific biomarker for GCA to date. Blood tests for inflammation have limited sensitivity, and \"seronegative\" GCA can occur in up to 4 percent of patients. The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for GCA are not diagnostic criteria. Although TABx is an invasive and time-consuming test, most authorities feel that it remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of GCA. Although the most common complication of GCA is visual loss, most clinical prediction algorithms for GCA do not incorporate an ocular blood flow measurement. Possible methods to assess reduction in blood flow in GCA include fluorescein angiography, oculoplethysmography, dynamic contour tonometry, and OCT greater than 20 seconds on fluorescein angiography is suggestive but not specific for GCA. In patients with GCA, Dr. Thomas Bosley (Johns Hopkins University) showed there is reduced ocular pulse amplitude with his pneumo-oculoplethysmography (OPG) technique. OPG is a cumbersome technique that is rarely performed nowadays. Pascal Dynamic contour tonometry was popularized for glaucoma over the last decade. Dynamic contour tonometry (DCT) provides a digital readout of intraocular pressure as well as an estimation of the ocular pulse amplitude (OPA). The OPA is the difference in intraocular pressure during the cardiac cycle, and represents the pulsatile wave front produced by the varying amount of choroidal blood flow between systole and diastole. The DCT painlessly estimates the OPA and ocular blood flow in 7 seconds. In collaboration with a group at the University of Toronto, we hypothesized that the DCT OPA would be reduced in patients with positive TABx compared with negative TABx. All patients undergoing TABx for suspected GCA were included in this prospective, multicenter study. On univariate logistic regression, only the average ocular pulse amplitude and platelet count showed a statistically significant difference between the biopsy groups. Age, CRP, biopsy length, and jaw claudication did not show a statistically significant difference on univariate logistic regression. We found OPA to be inversely related to the risk of GCA and to be a statistically significant predictor of positive TABx; we concluded that it can be incorporated as part of a prediction rule for GCA (Figure 1). In addition, our project \"Oculomotor Assessment as a Potential Biomarker for Huntington's Disease,\" for which I am collaborating with Dr. Wasim Malik (Massachusetts General Hospital) and Dr. Samuel Frank (BIDMC), was funded by the Huntington's Disease Society of America. The major goals of this project are to develop a novel eye-movement based paradigm for assessment, diagnosis and progression monitoring of Huntington's disease (HD), using a convenient and portable eye-tracking system, and to develop a novel quantitative biomarker for early diagnosis of HD, leading to better detection, improved clinical management, and therapy development for this disease.

In collaboration with Dr. John V. Frangioni (BIDMC), we are using two imaging modalities: Fluorescence-Assisted Resection and Exploration (FLARE) system and Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI). We have successfully translated this technology from large animal models to first-in-human clinical trials. Moreover, by virtue of our results using these technologies and with the collaboration of Dr. Hak Soo Choi (Massachusetts General Hospital), we want to advance in the knowledge of vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) by combining immunohistochemically techniques with our well-developed NIR technologies in order to detect early signs of graft rejection. We are working to develop small and large animal protocols to start our research in this field for reconstructive surgery. Finally, our clinical research group is examining outcomes and patient satisfaction after breast cancer and reconstructive surgery. Using a large institutional database at BIDMC, as well as national databases from the ACS-NSQIP, we have been able to explore risk factors that lead to complications. In addition, we have been able to understand the relationships between type of reconstruction and patient satisfaction. Most recently, we have been examining patient access, health literacy, and readability of online resources for plastic surgery as well as metrics related with plastic surgeons academic output. Near infrared imaging systems Our most recent studies have focused on using the FLARE system to examine perfusion and thrombosis in microsurgery. Using a fluorophore such as indocyanine green, we can identify areas of occlusion and thrombosis within the vasculature. This enables us to resect and repair vessels and identify reestablished perfusion with the FLARE system. This allows assessment of real-time perfusion characteristics and image guidance during surgery. We also are examining near infrared imaging using different fluorophores in transplant rejection models. In a separate face transplantation model, we are using SFDI to identify perfusion characteristics by targeting tissue constituents (such as hemoglobin). Through the use of this imaging system, we can examine oxygenation of our face transplantation models over a large field of view. In conjunction with surface profilometry, we can provide gradient maps of three-dimensionally complex reconstructive flaps with a single capture snapshot for guidance in the operating room and during surgery. We have successfully translated this technology for use in a clinical trial in patients undergoing breast reconstruction. Patient access and health literacy in plastic and reconstructive surgery Our clinical outcomes research team has extensively examined the area of health literacy and patient access. The AMA and NIH guidelines are for patient-directed health literature to be written at a sixth grade level. Unfortunately, most patient resources are well above this level. Our group has examined online patient resources and their readability for patients not only in the English-speaking population but also in the Spanish-speaking population. Finally, our group is also designing new patient materials at appropriate reading levels to evaluate their use in patient education.

Egeler, MD Anna Rose Johnson, BA, MPH Masoud Malyar, MD Abbas Peymani, MDRESEARCH FOCUS Over the past year, my focus continues to be both basic and clinical research across a spectrum of disciplines in plastic and reconstructive surgery. These are collaborative projects utilizing the expertise and experiences of scientists, engineers, and clinicians. Our main collaborators include: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Tufts University, Massachusetts General Hospital/Wellman Center for Photomedicine, and Boston Children's Hospital. Electrochemical activation and inhibition of neuromuscular systems with modulation of ion concentrations using ion-selective membranes This project is a collaborative effort with MIT since 2008. Our pilot data was published in Nature Materials on October 2011. The primary focus of our work is the development of an electrochemical nerve stimulation and blocking method via local modulation of ion concentrations at the peripheral nerve surface using a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device. Our goal is to fabricate innovative neuroprosthetic devices that can reduce the threshold for nerve stimulation to aid in paralysis/paresis and/or block nerve firing to reduce pain for conditions such as facial nerve paralysis, chronic pain, and nerve dysfunction syndromes. Use of silk-based orthopedic devices to modulate healing This project is a collaborative effort with scientists and engineers at Tufts University in which we are developing degradable silk protein-based orthopedic devices (screws and plates). Our pilot data was published in Nature Communications on March 2014. These devices may be able to provide immediate surgical stabilization for orthopedic repair, promote active repair, and reduce infections by releasing therapeutics, and also be fully degrading, avoiding the need for future surgeries for removal. Use of novel oxygen-sensing paint-on liquid bandage for tissue oxygenation monitoring This project is a collaborative effort with the Wellman Center for Photomedicine/ Massachusetts General Hospital in which we are developing a novel oxygen- sensing paint-on liquid bandage (see Figure 1) for use in perioperative tissue oxygenation monitoring following microvascular free tissue reconstruction. Our pilot animal model data was published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery on July 2017, and we have since conducted a first in-human trial. This technology may be able to address limitations of the gold standard in tissue oxygenation monitoring. It has potential to improve flap failure rates by providing timely and accurate data to guide decision-making. 3D printing in plastic surgery We have been also focused on other applications of 3D printing, e.g. 3D printed surgical tools for use in plastic surgery either through customized implants or surgical planning. Potential applications in regards to our other basic science research include the use of 3D printing for production of silk screws and plates. Outcomes research in plastic surgery We also have an active clinical research group examining outcomes, techniques, and patient satisfaction following reconstructive and aesthetic plastic surgery procedures, including the head and neck, breast, and abdominal areas. Using large institutional databases at BIDMC, as well as national databases from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), we have been able to explore risk factors that lead to complications, trends over time, healthcare disparities, and cost analysis.

Indocyanine Green Angiography Use in Breast Reconstruction: A National Analysis of Outcomes and Cost in 110,320 Assistant Professor of Surgery Director of Lymphatic Surgery RESEARCH FOCUS Over the last several years, my clinical and basic science research has primarily been focused on the surgical prevention and treatment of lymphedema. In addition, our clinical research group has recently been studying (1) the potential applications of integrative medicine in the care of the plastic surgery patient and (2) the impact of ergonomics on a surgeon's well- being. Surgical Prevention and Treatment of Lymphedema Over the past year, in the midst of building a comprehensive clinical program in the surgical management of lymphedema, our group has worked in parallel to construct a complementary research program. Working closely with the FIRST team, we developed a robust quality improvement database that is capable of tracking patients and their outcomes longitudinally. Similarly, we have launched a unique biorepository that now houses healthy and diseased lymphatic tissue. Working closely with Dr. Timothy Padera at the Steele Laboratories at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), we are developing protocols for further tissue investigation. In the laboratory, we have worked to develop the first animal model to investigate the physiology of preventing lymphedema surgically at the time of lymphadenectomy. Specifically, working in collaboration with Dr. Hak Soo Choi, Gordon Center for Imaging at MGH, we are utilizing unique lymphatic specific dyes to report real-time changes in lymphatic flow from an extremity. In doing so, we have demonstrated a 47% increase in lymphatic flow out of an extremity if a surgical lymphatic bypass is performed at the time of the lymphadenectomy. Integrative Medicine and Plastic Surgery Our clinical outcomes team has previously demonstrated that a high percentage of patients presenting to plastic surgery clinics have already demonstrated an interest and utilized integrative or complementary techniques within one year of presentation to our service. More recently, in collaboration with Dr. Gloria Yeh, Director of Research at the Cheng-Tsui Integrated Health Center at BIDMC, we have been evaluating which natural products and mind-body techniques demonstrate high level evidence for efficacy in the peri- operative management of the plastic surgery patient. Most recently, working in collaboration with Dr. Yeh and Dr. Weidong Lu at the Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, we have been awarded a Pilot Grant from the Osher Institute to prospectively study the biologic changes of acupuncture on patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema. We began enrolling patients in March, 2018. Surgical Ergonomics Over the past year, our clinical research team, in collaboration with Dr. Jack Dennerlein at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, has studied and published on the significantly higher rate of work related musculoskeletal disorders in surgeons compared to the general population. We simultaneously evaluated the current state of ergonomic education provided to residents in surgical training, highlighting the need for the development of a more robust educational model.RESEARCH GROUP Andres Doval, MD Sherise Epstein, MPH Aaron Fleishman, MPH Anna Rose Johnson, MPH Leo Magrini, BS Claire Rosenwasser, MS Qing Ruan, MD Bao Tran, MD (A) FLARE image of a lymphaticovenous bypass in the swine groin prior to hind limb lymphatic injection with fluorophore.

My main research field is diabetes and its complications, with the main emphasis on wound healing and cardiovascular disease. Approximately 90 percent of my effort is dedicated to research, 5 percent for teaching and an additional 5 percent for administrative and other relevant professional activities. Translational research is a major part of my research activities. My work mainly focuses on the interaction between neuropathy and microvascular disease in the development of diabetic foot ulceration and the subsequent impairment of wound healing. This work has been supported by the NIH and nonprofit organizations. I collaborate with investigators from various departments at BIDMC, and investigators from other institutions, such as Brigham and Women's Hospital, to conduct additional translational research. I conduct investigator-initiated research studies that examine the effects of various FDA-approved medications on cardiovascular function. These studies, although funded by industry, have been conceived, designed, and executed by my unit and focus on possible new mechanisms through which these medications exert their beneficial effects. I have also served as the lead investigator and lead author in industry sponsored multicenter trials that investigated the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions for the management of diabetic foot ulceration. I also run my own basic research laboratory that mainly explores the findings of this translational research and tries to identify mechanisms underlying the observed results. My laboratory works closely with other laboratories in BIDMC and is funded by NIH grants. I also collaborate with Dr. David Mooney's laboratory at the Wyss Institute and Harvard Engineering School and Dr. Jonathan Garlick's at Tufts Medical School. The main aim of our collaboration is the development of new wound-healing products. This collaboration has resulted in NIH funding of our grant applications. The results of my research have been published in prestigious medical journals, including Lancet, Diabetes, and Circulation. My work, according to Google Scholar as of December 2017, has resulted in more than 17,200 citations an h-index of 67 and i10-index of 149. I have also been the Director of the Rongxiang Xu, MD, Center for Regenerative Therapeutics since its establishment in December 2015. The center was established after a generous donation from the National Rongxiang Xu Foundation and its mission is to further advance the treatment of patients throughout the world with chronic wounds, burns, and other conditions resulting from a failure of tissue repair and regeneration. As part of its mission, the Center provides resources for the conduction of collaborative bench-to-bedside research with investigators worldwide, as well as the education of physicians and scientists internationally.

A method was first developed to allow for the production of an off-the-shelf product that could be manufactured in terms of hundreds of bandages within the span of a few days. Once we had established our method for the production of bandages, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were used to test the feasibility of these bandages as a delivery vehicle. We next optimized the isolation in vitro expansion and polarization of primary mouse monocytes. Next, we investigated whether the primary cells could be loaded and polarized into the bandages (see Figure 1). Finally, in our fist pilot in vivo experiment, bandages loaded with cells were used to cover dorsal wounds in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The wound closure calculations from the experiment show a clear effect of the macrophages in wound healing, especially the M1 phenotype (see Figure 2). We are currently in the process of analyzing all the histology data and are planning for a larger scale experiment with higher number of mice and using the diabetic db/db model. In other research, we are testing the ability of biomaterials that sequentially release factors to first recruit and then direct the M2 phenotype to enhance healing in diabetic, neuropathic rodent wounds. In the final year of the grant, we plan to complete the remaining animal experiments that will provide all necessary data that will allow us to prove or reject our primary hypothesis regarding the role of M2 macrophages. In addition, we will investigate whether our biomaterials can successfully improve impaired diabetic wound healing.SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Bai S, Nagai M, Koerner SK, Veves A, Sun L.

Clowes Distinguished Professor of Surgery Vice Chair, Research RESEARCH FOCUS My research is focused on clinical studies related to endocrine surgery. Recent studies involved different aspects of the follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer (FVPTC). In one project, we determined the relationship between follicular adenoma and FVPTC and found that increasing numbers of tumors diagnosed as FVPTC were accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in cases signed out as follicular adenoma. The study, published in Surgery (2016;159:1396-1406), suggests that patients with tumors diagnosed as FVPTC may sometimes be subjected to unnecessarily extensive surgical treatment and radioiodine treatment. In another project, the influence of thyroid hormones on cervical brown adipose tissue (BAT) was examined. The study is important because BAT activation by thyroid hormones may protect from obesity, insulin resistance/diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. The study was a feasibility investigation to determine the possibility of using BAT obtained during neck surgery (thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy) to examine the regulation of BAT activity and was published in THYROID (2016;27:1-10). We are presently performing studies testing whether certain features of \"suspicious for cancer\" cytology combined with features of preoperative thyroid ultrasound may make it possible to differentiate between invasive FVPTC and Non-Invasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features (NIFTP) This would make it possible to recommend less aggressive surgery in many patients with cytology being \"suspicious for cancer.\" Although NIFTP can be managed as a non-malignant tumor, invasive FVPTC continues to be considered a malignant tumor. We recently performed genetic analysis of an invasive FVPTC in a patient with an aggressive variant of invasive FVPTC. A 47-year-old man presented with a metastasis to his right iliac bone as the initial manifestation of a 1.6 cm invasive FVPTC (Figures 1 and 2). The patient underwent total thyroidectomy but despite additional aggressive treatment, the disease progressed, resulting in the patient's demise. Next-generation sequencing of the primary tumor using a pan-cancer targeted mutation and gene fusion panel revealed NRAS Q61K mutation and no other oncogenic alterations, suggesting that an isolated RAS mutation in invasive FVPTC may be associated with aggressive clinical behavior, challenging the prevailing concept that thyroid neoplasms with isolated RAS mutations are associated with favorable clinical behavior. The patient was reported in Int J Surg Case Rep (2017;38:1-5). A study was recently initiated to determine the role of different preoperative imaging tests (ultrasound, Sestamibi scanning, and four-dimensional CT, 4D-CT) in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. In particular, we will investigate the results of 4D-CT, a novel modality of preoperative imaging in patients with hyperparathyroidism. Ongoing studies are based on a prospective database in the Section of Endocrine Surgery that has been active for about 15 years and contains information from more than 6,000 patients.

James, MD, MS Assistant Professor of Surgery Section Chief, Endocrine Surgery Associate Surgery Clerkship Director, BIDMCSurgical Oncology RESEARCH GROUP Courtney Barrows, MD Janeil Belle, MD Ryan Graham, BS David Haggstrom, MD Lava Timsina, PhDRESEARCH FOCUS Over the past several decades there has been a substantial increase in the diagnosis and treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer. This rise has largely been attributed to increased detection of nonaggressive and nonlethal thyroid cancers. It has been suggested that this rise has resulted in an epidemic of overtreatment of thyroid cancer. My research has focused on population-level analysis of thyroid cancer incidence and the clinical and economic implications of this rapid rise. Effect of healthcare expansion on the treatment of thyroid cancer In 2006, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts passed a health care reform law which expanded health insurance for government-subsidized, self-pay, and uninsured individuals in the state. I hypothesized that as a result of healthcare expansion, there would be an increase in the rate of thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer related to increased access to care. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used data from the State Inpatient Databases (SID) for Massachusetts and six control states. Using difference-in-difference models, we were able to show a startling 26 percent increase in the treatment of thyroid cancer as a direct result of this healthcare reform. These results were published this year in JAMA Surgery (2017;152(8):734-740) and was widely cited in Medscape, Science Newsline, and Ecancer, among others. Economic impact of a diagnosis of thyroid cancer Cancer care expenditure in the United States continues to rise yearly and is projected to surpass $150 billion by 2020. Although thyroid cancer has a generally high survival rate, it is associated with a potential long term financial and psychological impact, which has not previously been rigorously studied. We aimed to evaluate the comparative prevalence of financial and psychological hardship among U.S. thyroid cancer and non-thyroid cancer survivors. In an ongoing evaluation using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), we have found that thyroid cancer survivors experience a significantly higher level of both material and psychological financial hardship compared to non-thyroid cancer survivors. These findings suggest that financial hardship may be under-recognized in the medical community and warrants further investigation into the etiology behind the financial burden associated with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Treatment patterns in thyroid cancer Over the past 15 years, there has been a growing body of literature suggesting a rising incidence of thyroid cancer without a rise in mortality. As a result, there has been a shift in guidelines to offer less aggressive surgical intervention. These recommendations have come as multiple studies have shown that patients with thyroid cancer may have a similar prognosis when undergoing less aggressive surgical intervention such thyroid lobectomy. Our group hypothesized that despite evidence of equivalent survival with less aggressive treatment, patients are still undergoing aggressive surgeries for the treatment of thyroid cancer regardless of the size of the cancer. We are currently evaluating these treatment patterns and have shown in preliminary research that the trends in treatment patterns over the past 15 years, have not changed.77 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 Elected to the Editorial Board of the Journal of Surgical Research Elected to the Program Committee for the Academic Surgical Congress Appointed Associate Surgery Clerkship Director, BIDMC Invited Presentations An update in international trends in incidence rates of thyroid cancer from 1973-2007, Academic Surgical Congress Surgical outcomes in pediatric Graves' disease, Academic Surgical Congress An estimate of economic and psychological hardship among thyroid cancer survivors, American College of Surgeons 25 years of therapy for papillary thyroid cancer, American Thyroid Association TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION I have developed an endocrine surgery teaching series for residents rotating on the endocrine surgery service.

The goal is to derive best practices, determine optimal processes, and improve quality of care in the management of patients with breast cancer. The program integrates health services research, including the use of large internal and national cancer databases, to critically appraise clinical results and patient reported outcomes. Outcomes include traditional clinical metrics in breast cancer (e.g. survival, complications, local recurrence), as well as patient well-being, satisfaction, functional status, and impact on the healthcare system. The results then \"translate\" into practice and policy by working with clinicians, professional societies, patients, payers, and purchasers of healthcare. Outcomes research seeks to understand the end results of particular health care practices and interventions. By linking the care people get to the outcomes they experience, outcomes research has become the key to developing better ways to monitor and improve the quality of care.79 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 National Cancer Database research awards Invited podium presentations at multiple national surgical research meetings Peer-reviewed publications in surgical journals TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION Our research fellow completed a Master of Science in Epidemiology Degree Program, a 42.5 credit program with the goal of training clinicians with the quantitative skills needed for a clinical research career. Research training is provided through a series of required and elective courses. In addition, students in this program are required to complete a research thesis under the joint supervision of a local research advisor and a member of the faculty of the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Our research team receives formal mentoring in the areas of clinical outcomes research, quantitative and qualitative methods, designing high-level observational studies, assessing validity, working with clinical registries, managing and analyzing large datasets, mixed methods research, implementation science, manuscript preparation, grant writing skills, and academic career development. Our Clinical Scholarship Program pairs all first-year categorical general surgery residents with a faculty research mentor who guides the residents throughout the year as they acquire the skills to develop and implement a clinical research project.

Through this analysis, we hope to delineate best care practices through refined patient selection methods and improved medical, endoscopic, and surgical techniques. In the last year, we have partnered with the laboratory of Richard Cummings, PhD, to expand the scope of our research to include examination of the pathogenesis of this entity\u2014specifically the potential role of glycan-binding proteins involved in immune regulation and TBM. A better understanding of this pathway and its relation to TBM could potentially lead to the development of novel therapies. Additionally, we are currently evaluating the acoustical features of cough and respiratory sounds in patients with symptomatic, severe, diffuse TBM. By recording these features, we hope to define a unique acoustic signature and eventually investigate its diagnostic utility. I have been investigating novel methods of staging lung cancer utilizing near-infrared imaging technology. I am the site PI for the \"A Phase 2, Single dose, Open-Label, Exploratory Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of OTL38 Injection for Intraoperative Imaging of Folate Receptor Positive Lung Nodules.\" Patients enrolled in the study are administered a single dose of OTL38, a folate analog ligand conjugated with an indole cyanine-like green dye. During their procedure as indicated by standard of care, an imaging system equipped with near-infrared technology is used to aid in malignancy detection. We were the first in this study to enroll and plan to continue through 2018. In vivo evaluation of a pulmonary nodule: (a) without endoscopic imaging system; (b) detection of pulmonary nodule using endoscopic imaging system in a patient infused with OTL-38 prior to procedure; (c) back table analysis of excised pulmonary nodule without imaging system; and (d) analysis of the same nodule utilizing imaging system in near- infrared imaging model.a b c d85 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 The significance and management of excessive dynamic airway collapse: A pro/con debate, American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Annual Conference, Toronto, ON, 2017 Parenchymal-sparing approaches to lung metastases, Invited speaker and tumor board panelist, World Congress of Interventional Oncology annual meeting, Boston, MA, 2017 Technical aspects of tracheobronchoplasty for tracheobronchomalacia, Invited operative training session, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 2017 What's new for TBM 2017, Guest speaker, Tri-State Egg Harbor, WI, Complex airway surgery: Tracheobronchoplasty, Grand Rounds, Department of Anesthesia, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 2017 Advanced open esophageal and tracheal procedures, Course director, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Annual Meeting, STS University Course, Houston, TX, 2017 Finding the right job and transitioning to practice, Course director, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Annual Meeting, Residents Symposium, Houston, TX, 2017 Outstanding Filipino-American Physician Award, Philippine Medical Association of New England, 2017 GK 50 Honoree, List of Boston's 50 Most Influential People of Color in Healthcare & Life Sciences, Calette Phillips Communications, Neighborhood Health Plan and Partners Healthcare, 2017 Boston's Top Doctors, Thoracic and Cardiac Surgery, Castle Connolly and Boston Magazine, 2016 and 2017 While participating in the EMPROVE and LIBERATE Trials, the Interventional Pulmonary team identified a subgroup of patients for which endobronchial lung volume reduction by way of intrabronchial valves (IBVs) was not an option due to incomplete interlobar fissures. In 2016-2017, in collaboration with Spiration, Inc., we successfully showed complete targeted lobar collapse through a minimally invasive surgical stapling technique to complete interlobar fissures followed by IBV placement in both ex-vivo and live animal models. In 2018, we plan to transition this research to a pivotal human clinical trial in hopes of helping patients who would otherwise not be candidates for such treatment.SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Castillo-Angeles M, Watkins AA, Acosta L, SP, Atkins KM, Kent TS.

Our research areas include: Emphysema Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Multicenter Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of the IBV\u00ae Valve System for the Single Lobe Treatment of Severe Emphysema (EMPROVE). We are evaluating the improvement of lung function after treatment with the IBV\u00ae Valve System compared to medical management. Benefits of the IBV to patients may include: Reduction in lung volume Improvement in pulmonary function and quality of life Lung Function Improvement after Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction with Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves (EBV) Used in Treatment of Emphysema (LIBERATE). This is a phase 3, multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled study with EBV treatment. Benefits to patients may include: Improvement in lung function Increased exercise tolerance Prolonged air leaks Safety and Effectiveness of the Spiration Valve System in Air Leaks, Valves against Standard Therapy (VAST). We are evaluating the treatment with the Spiration Valve System (SVS) as compared to standard chest tube drainage management and other standard-of-care interventions in this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study. Benefits to the patients may include: Reduction in air leak resolution time and overall hospital stay Lung cancer diagnostics Evaluation of the ArchimedesTM System for Transparenchymal Nodules Access 2 (EAST 2). The purpose of this study is to continue evaluating the safety and performance of an updated version of the LungPoint System (called the ArchimedesTM System) for aiding the physician in guiding endoscopic tools to pulmonary nodule(s) located more distally in parenchymal tissue. Benefits of this system may include: Higher yield rate than existing bronchoscopic biopsy modalities Patient access to a minimally invasive bronchoscopic approach to the diagnosis of lung cancer A Multi-Center Trial of the ProLung TestTM (Transthoracic Bioconductance Measurement) as an Adjunct to CT Chest Scans for the Risk Stratification of Patients with Pulmonary Lesions Suspicious for Lung Cancer. This study aims to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the ProLung Test in the risk stratification of patients with pulmonary lesions identified by CT that are suspicious for lung cancer. Tracheobronchomalacia Our division maintains the largest tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) registry in the United States, which has enabled us to develop current guidelines for medical, endoscopic, and surgical therapy.

Rodrigue, PhD Paul Vanderlaan, MD Richard I. Whyte, MDRESEARCH FOCUS My research has focused largely on clinical outcomes in the following areas: Complex Airway Disease This high volume program at BIDMC allows us to encounter a large number of patients with adult tracheobronchomalacia. As part of our collaboration with interventional pulmonology, we continue to build on an existing database so that we can learn more about the etiology, natural disease process with and without intervention, and surgical outcomes\u2014and increase the recognition of this rare disease. We are currently working on developing and validating a quality of life questionnaire for adult tracheobronchomalacia so that we can better follow our patients' outcomes in the future. Lung Cancer I am part of several collaborative groups with Alexander Bankier, MD (Chief, Cardiothoracic Imaging Section of Radiology) and Paul Vanderlaan, MD (Director of Thoracic Pathology). Our collaborative projects have included radiology-pathology-surgical correlates of squamous cell lung cancer as well as lung cancers with specific pathologic findings such as visceral pleural invasion. In addition, we are exploring inter-observer agreement among pathologists for frozen section on lung cancer adenocarcinoma subtypes. Lung Cancer Screening I have recently joined the Department of Public Health Lung Cancer Screening Work Group in order to learn more about how we can collaborate to combat lung cancer screening disparities. There are many opportunities for focus groups, pilot implementation projects, hospital level, state level, and national level interventions that could help us better understand and mitigate lung cancer screening disparities.

Fisher, MD, FACS Professor of Surgery Chief, Transplantation RESEARCH GROUP Giuseppe Pettinato, PhD Melissa ThompsonRESEARCH FOCUS I took the lead in the NIH-funded multicenter \"A2ALL\" (Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplant) prospective study. Of the original nine PIs in participating centers in the United States, I was one of only six of them to hold the U01 for both five-year complete grant periods, including the three-year extension. This study has become the landmark trial for living-donor liver transplant in this country since its inception in 2001 and completion on August 31, 2014, with the receipt of over $8 million in NIH and private funding over the years. In early 2016 we received approval from UNOS to reinstate the living donor liver transplant program at BIDMC, and since then four successful adult LDLTs have been performed, with three more scheduled for 2018. In addition to the A2ALL NIH multicenter trial, I was awarded NIH funding for spinoff studies looking at genomics and proteomics of hepatitis-C-associated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which produced landmark results and publications describing profiles of patients with hepatitis-C who develop HCC and which patients will have a high risk of recurrence after transplantation. Success in both scientific research and clinical hepatocyte transplantation since 1991 has led to my strong involvement in the field of cell transplantation, with frequent invitations to chair or moderate sessions at national and international meetings of organ transplant and cell transplant societies. I have been formally appointed to the Editorial Boards of Liver Transplantation, Cell Transplantation, and Cell R4 Journal. I am also an ad hoc reviewer of many journals in the field and abstract reviewer for the American Transplant Congress, International Liver Transplantation Society, The Transplantation Society, and the International Cancer Association. I am also honored to serve as President of the Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Society (September 2017-September 2019). Melissa Thompson, BS, Cell Transplant Specialist, is my Research Program Manager for all laboratory operations. We are the center at BIDMC for hepatocyte and stem cell transplant, with continuation of my FDA IND in hepatocyte transplantation which started in Richmond. Giuseppe Pettinato, PhD, Instructor in Surgery, is the Director of my Stem Cell Lab. BIDMC has an American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS)-accredited Kidney Fellowship Program and my expectation is to reinstate our ASTS-accredited Liver Fellowship Program, eventually extending that to an ASTS-accredited Pancreas Program, and finally an accredited Hepatobiliary Surgery Program combined with the Hepatobiliary Surgery Group here at BIDMC after the Lahey merger practice legalities are completed.93 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 President of the Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Society Serve on Board of Directors for the American Foundation for Donation and Transplantation Member of the editorial boards for Liver Transplantation, Liver Disease Review Letters, Medscape, LL Transplantation Editorial Advisory Board, Transplantation Proceedings, World Journal of Transplantation, and Cell R4 Journal Invited Presentations Tissue engineering and biomaterials for regenerative medicine; 9th World Congress of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell, Seoul, South Korea, 2016 Challenges in clinical translation with hepatocytes; Center for Drug Safety and Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Workshop on Novel Biotechnology in Liver Diseases, Shanghai, China, 2017 Differentiation of hiPSC into hepatocyte-like clusters; Center for Drug Safety and Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Workshop on Novel Biotechnology in Liver Diseases, Shanghai, China, 2017 Challenges in clinical translation with hepatocytes; Canadian Society of Transplantation/ Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Society Joint Scientific Meeting; Halifax, Nova Scotia, 2017SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Pettinato G, Ramanathan R, Fisher RA, Mangino MJ, Zhang N, Wen X.

Some of my trainees have gone on to illustrious careers of their own, and at least two are now department chairs. Since my arrival at BIDMC in the fall of 2014, I have given invited talks and in-services to multiple departments in the hospital, especially in the clinical area of live donor liver transplantation, including two daylong multidisciplinary Mock Drills to teach the processes and procedures involved in this difficult surgery to peers, nurses and OR staff. I have also been an invited speaker at regional conferences including the Nurses' Conference at the New England Organ Bank, and courses such as the HMS course \"Advances in Gastroenterology.\"SELECTED RESEARCH SUPPORT Advancing Renal Transplant Efficacy and Safety Outcomes with Everolimus- based regimen (TRANSFORM); Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2015-2017; Co-PI: Robert A.

Otterbein, PhD Professor of Surgery RESEARCH GROUP Eva Csizmadia, MS Mahtab Faktari, MD David Gallo James Harbison Ghee MS Shazhad Shaefi, MD Rodrigo Souza, PhD Janick WeberRESEARCH FOCUS Inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) is in numerous FDA phase trials, based in large part from the research that has arisen from my laboratory over the past decade. We continue to maintain a focus on the innate immune response and defense mechanisms in models of trauma, infection, ischemia reperfusion injury, and regenerative responses to tissue damage. The foundation of our work lies in the study of protective genes and in particular those that degrade heme and include heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and biliverdin reductase (BVR). Both of these genes are intimately involved in the stress response and function in large part by generating CO and bilirubin as endogenous products. We have expanded our research program to include collaborative projects on cancer, neurology and more recently exercise physiology. Each of these complement and advance our understanding of the acute stress response and the roles of HO-1/CO as they relate to immunologic and pathophysiologic responses. Ultimately, we are interested in translational research to provide solutions towards alleviating human suffering. Role of Heme in Trauma and Infection This year we reinforced collaborative efforts in models of trauma and the impact on susceptibility to pneumonia. As Co-Director of a 6-project CDMRP Department of Defense focused research award ($10M) awarded in 2017, we are seeking to provide deliverables to benefit the injured warfighter. As PI of one project our approach is to define how heme influences recovery from trauma and susceptibility to bacterial infection. The research involves interactive studies with Carl Hauser, MD (BIDMC, Surgery), Jim Lederer, PhD (BWH, Surgery), Daniel Talmor (BIDMC, Anesthesiology), Simon Robson (BIDMC, Medicine), and Michael Yaffe, MD, PhD (MIT). Our data in sepsis models shows that HO-1 derived CO acts directly on bacteria, coercing them to generate ATP, which activates local immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils and initiates a full immune response to clear bacteria through an inflammasome-mediated mechanism of action. Additionally HO-1/CO promote liver regeneration after a crush injury. Neuroprotection with HO-1 and the Role of the Circadian Clock We maintain an active collaboration with Khalid Hanafy, MD, PhD, (BIDMC, Neurology) in the study of hemorrhagic stroke, where we find that glia-expressed HO-1 is critical in resolution of injury and impacts neurotransmission as it relates to memory. Inhaled CO enhances recovery, reduces inflammation and cell death, and improves cognitive function. The mechanism involves the ability of CO to boost phagocytosis of erythrocytes. Recently we reported in Stroke the circadian rhythm of HO-1 in the brain and demonstrate that HO-1/CO promote recovery from hemorrhagic stroke in part by modulation of central clock genes including Period and NPAS2 among others. We are actively collaborating with the labs of Dr. Hanafy (BIDMC, Neurology) and Dr. Eng Lo (MGH, Radiology) in a multi-PI approach in conjunction with pharma to develop CO as a treatment strategy for hemorrhagic stroke. Given the above salutary effects of CO in the brain, we submitted a proposal to the National Football League (NFL) and were selected as part of a multi-institutional program grant ($18M) to evaluate the effects of CO to alleviate brain injury simulating that which would occur as a result of multiple mild concussions that occur during football games. Together with Dr. Ping Lu (BIDMC, Medicine), and Dr. Patrick Fuller (BIDMC, Neurology) we will test over the next five years the ability of CO to limit injury and promote recovery in preclinical models of concussion. Exciting preliminary data in mice demonstrate the remarkable role of HO-1 in brain homeostasis. Carbon Monoxide and Kidney Transplant IWe are funded with Phase 2 NIH SBIR ($1.5M) to study an exciting and innovative oral CO solution in rat and pig models of kidney transplant in collaboration with Hillhurst Biopharmaceuticals. These studies are ongoing, but complement and expand on those we reported on with inhaled CO, which showed a benefit to reduce delayed graft function and triggered the first human trial. The oral formulation is simple and is being applied to multiple model systems including TBI and trauma. Proof of principal has been demonstrated and the CO formulation is now being prepared for human testing. HO-1 in Cancer In collaboration and funded by Agios Pharmaceuticals, we are interested in the role of macrophages in tumor growth testing the hypothesis that the phenotype of the macrophage regulates its ability to direct Tcell function. Using our regulated HO-1 null mice, we find that blockade of HO-1 significantly reduces tumor growth. 95 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.Relationship Between the Microbiome, Glycome, and Tissue Damage It has been known that the intestinal microbiome is important in numerous immune regulatory functions and that HO-1/CO can influence the intestinal flora in models of acute inflammation. Additionally, preliminary data show that injury leads to a change in serum N-glycosylation. This finding is part of a new collaborative project with Richard Cummings (BIDMC, Surgery) and Carl Hauser (BIDMC, Surgery), to integrate glycobiology and microbiome modulation in response to injury comparing human and murine samples. HO-1 and Exercise Metabolism A new project in the laboratory, we are interested in how physical exercise influence HO-1 expression and can contribute to offering protection in models described above. Preliminary findings suggest that exercise metabolism is influenced by heme catabolism and the generation of CO. ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 We continue to be one of the leaders in the area of heme metabolism and the stress response, providing mechanistic insight into the role of HO-1 and its bioactive products carbon monoxide and the bile pigments. Our publications continue to provide important contributions toward therapeutic use of these molecules in the clinic, which guided more than 10 ongoing clinical trials with CO. We consider ourselves a team with excellent technical skills combined with creative and innovative approaches to research design, always with translation to human disease in our sites. TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION I continue to participate in the training of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, surgical residents, and junior faculty in basic research, grant proposals, and career guidance.

In the meantime, the number of people waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant continues to rise, with over 120,000 people currently on the national transplant waiting list. Together with colleagues at BIDMC, the New England Donor Services, and several transplant programs around the country, we are developing and evaluating novel strategies to increase the rates of both living and deceased donation. These strategies address individual and systematic barriers we have identified through earlier research that are associated with lower organ donation rates. \"How can we reduce persistent race and income disparities in transplantation?\" Some minorities and low-income patients, relative to white patients and those with more financial resources, experience more kidney transplant access barriers, are more likely to have initiated dialysis at time of transplant referral, wait longer for a deceased donor transplant, are less likely to receive a live donor kidney transplant, have higher mortality rates on the waiting list, and have less optimal transplant outcomes. Since the proportion of patients on the kidney transplant waiting list is increasing for racial/ethnic minorities (while declining for whites), the shortage of deceased donor kidneys is likely to exacerbate these transplant disparities in the years ahead. We are conducting studies to better understand the precise cause of these disparities, to evaluate novel strategies for mitigating these disparities, and to examine the impact of policy changes on these disparities. The success of our research program is due largely to the collaborative partnerships we have with federal and state governments, organ procurement organizations, and researchers from diverse professional backgrounds, including behavioral and medical sciences, public health, surgery, bioethics, nursing, and health services.97 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 We received NIH funding to evaluate strategies to reduce racial and income disparities in live donor kidney transplantation, another Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) grant to evaluate a novel program to increase favorable attitudes toward vascularized composite allotransplantation and donation among military veterans, and a Patient- Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) contract to further evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based intervention to reduce racial disparity in kidney transplantation. I co-authored several manuscripts examining outcomes in living kidney donors and the disparity-reducing benefits of the novel Transplant House Calls intervention. I accepted invitations to present our work at the European Society of Transplantation in Barcelona, and at several U.S. transplant programs, including the University of Wisconsin and Medical University of South Carolina.

This work has implications for understanding novel targets and potential therapeutics for treatment of cancer and beyond. Working with others at BIDMC, I am developing anti-cancer molecules that target cell cycle progression and the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, my laboratory dissects the roles of innate immune cells (i.e., myeloid cells) in stress responses. My interest lies in regulatory mechanisms related to the heme biology and other immunometabolic genes (i.e., LDH-A) in tumor evolution and cancer therapy. The metabolic pathway of heme degradation is a critical regulator of inflammation and tumor growth. Much of my efforts have been directed towards understanding how the enzymes involved in heme degradation (biliverdin reductase/BVR and heme oxygenase-1/HO-1) and the products (carbon monoxide, biliverdin/bilirubin, iron) control metabolism and gene regulation in both immune and cancer cells.99 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 Cover of July 2017 issue of Cancer Research (Seth P, Csizmadia E, Hedblom A, Vuerich M, Xie H, Li M, Longhi MS, Wegiel B.

Crociani, MPH Sara Hyde Kyle McAnally Adrian Waisman, MD Andrew Wagner, MDRESEARCH FOCUS My research focus is in urologic cancer, and is highly collaborative in nature, most importantly within BIDMC, but also with outside institutions. I work very closely with Andrew Wagner, MD, and together we co-lead the Urology research team and share research personnel. Our team's research in kidney and bladder cancer are described in Dr. Wagner's report. As Director of the BIDMC Prostate Cancer Center, I will describe my research efforts to optimize quality-of-life in prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer Quality-of-life assessment in prostate cancer patients At BIDMC, we are committed to giving every patient with prostate cancer a chance to have the best quality of life possible. Unfortunately, prostate cancer treatment can cause significant side effects, and doctors tend to underestimate how bad these are, potentially leaving patients with long-lasting quality of life problems. My research focuses on accurate and objective measurement of prostate cancer quality of life using patient-reported outcome questionnaires. I developed a new questionnaire called \"EPIC for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP),\" designed to be used by clinicians rather than researchers (Chang P et al, J Urol Sep 2011). I recently showed that EPIC-CP can allow a doctor to estimate the chances of a patient recovering sexual function after prostate cancer surgery (Chipman et al, J Urol Mar 2014). Due to its development here at BIDMC, our institution is at the forefront in using EPIC-CP as part of prostate cancer care. Dr. Wagner and I recently published our results on the \"real-world\" use of EPIC-CP in post-surgery patients in the Journal of Urology (Wagner AA et al, J Urol Jan 2017). As a next step, I hope to show how using EPIC-CP can improve the practitioner work-flow and improve patient outcomes. Quality-of-life outcomes after prostate cancer treatment I am also interested in finding out what problems patients have after different treatments (surgery, external radiation, radioactive seed implants), and determining whether we can use this information to better guide patients toward optimal treatments. I am the Co-overall Principal Investigator of the PROST-QA study; this is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study that has the most complete and rigorous collection of prostate cancer quality-of-life data in the world. I recently published the results of a study showing that a subset of patients have improvement in their quality of life after prostate cancer treatment, specifically radical prostatectomy (Chang P et al, J Urol Feb 2017). Helping prostate cancer patients make treatment decisions Unlike other cancers, in which options may be limited after initial diagnosis, prostate cancer patients face a seemingly impossible task of choosing among several treatment options. Working with Donna Berry, PhD, RN (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), I serve as BIDMC site-responsible Principal Investigator for an NIH R01-funded randomized trial called Personal Patient Profile - Prostate (P3P). This unique study investigates the effectiveness of a web-based interactive program that gathers patient characteristics, quality-of-life (using EPIC-CP), personal preferences, and priorities, and uses this information to customize videos that counsel patients on how to discuss these issues with their doctor. We recently published our results in the Journal of Urology (Berry et al, J Urol Jul 2017).

Our research team works closely with colleagues within BIDMC as well as with collaborators at outside institutions. Our group has recently examined perioperative outcomes and costs associated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a minimally invasive percutaneous surgical procedure), when surgical teams involve single specialty and multi-specialty surgical teams (Speed et al, J Endourol Nov 2017). Additionally, we examined factors affecting radiation exposure from fluoroscopic imaging used for percutaneous renal access during lithotripsy. We are also developing a prospective endourologic database that will examine stone characteristics of patients treated at our center. Surgical Education I have initiated a multi-institutional study assessing a novel online platform to enhance resident education called myTIPreport. This platform is utilized to provide real-time feedback to trainees after each surgical procedure. The evaluations are performed using a Zwisch model to improve the quality and quantity of feedback delivered to surgical trainees. The aim is to encourage dialogue between faculty and trainees, allowing directed and meaningful feedback to be given to residents after each surgical case. The findings from the pilot study were presented at the New England Section of the American Urological Association 2017 Annual Meeting. As a next step, I hope to assess the effect of this teaching platform on surgical skill acquisition.103 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 During the past year, I assumed the role of director of urologic education at BIDMC and now oversee academic and clinical programs for training the future generation of urology residents and medical students during their urology elective.

Using this data we are able to provide detailed recovery expectations for these patients. We also aim to define the costs of kidney surgery, including hospital costs and societal costs \u2014 by incorporating patient-reported data about leave from work, salary lost, and family leave. We were the first group to evaluate societal costs of kidney surgery in the period following hospital discharge. This work was first presented at the New England AUA meeting in 2015, and has been accepted for publication in the Canadian Journal of Urology in 2018. Our team has helped refine robotic surgery for kidney cancer; however we are also interested in non-operative approaches to small renal masses. Together with researchers from Johns Hopkins University and Columbia University, we are a main contributor to the DISSRM trial (Delayed Intervention and Surveillance for Small Renal Masses). This is a multicenter prospective study evaluating the role of surveillance and surgery of small kidney tumors over time. We have studied quality of life in these patients, evaluated changes in kidney function over time, evaluated tumor growth characteristics, and developed a scoring system to help clinicians during the decision-making process. Prostate cancer For over a decade, BIDMC has been a leader in evaluating quality of life for prostate cancer patients. Our group developed the EPIC-CP, a short form quality of life instrument used by clinicians worldwide to evaluate prostate cancer patients. Updates from this work were recently published in the Journal of Urology in 2017. Our group is also the area's leader in active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer. We are the only Northeast member of the Canary Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study (Canary-PASS). This is the largest prospective multi- center study of active surveillance for prostate cancer, with over 1,700 patients enrolled. We are collecting clinical data and biologic samples from patients in an effort to identify important biomarkers that could distinguish which patients have more aggressive prostate cancer from those with indolent disease. Recently we have looked at the timing of cancer progression, use of a four-kallikrein panel for prediction of prostate cancer progression, and evaluated a genomic index in cancer progression. Bladder cancer We are the first urology team in Boston to regularly perform radical cystectomy and urinary diversion completely robotically. We are gathering prospective data with a focus on clinical outcomes and validated quality of life. We also recently joined the IRCC (International Radical Cystectomy Consortium) for radical cystectomy, a large (50 center) database project aimed at evaluating trends in cystectomy treatment over time. This work was also presented at the 2015 New England AUA meeting, and will be presented as a podium presentation at the 2018 AUA meeting in San Francisco.

Ongoing research is directed at the following areas. Drug discovery Identification of new drugs to inhibit inflammation and thrombosis Selectins play an important role in the recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissue. We are currently synthesizing compounds to block inflammatory responses that contribute to deep venous thrombosis, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer metastasis. Biomaterials science Design of anti-thrombogenic surfaces The development of artificial organs remains limited by the propensity of all synthetic surfaces to induce thrombus formation despite systemic anticoagulation. Current studies are designing surfaces that present molecules that resist clotting and whose bioactive surfaces can be 'regenerated' in situ to extend and improve the clinical performance of blood contacting devices, such as vascular grafts, heart valves, left ventricular devices, and implantable artificial lungs and kidneys. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine Engineering blood vessels Synthetic blood vessel substitutes for cardiac or vascular surgery do not exist. Ongoing efforts in our group seek to design new synthetic collagen and elastin analogues and to assemble them along with vascular wall cells derived from stem cells to engineer a living artery. Vascular biology Targeted therapies to promote vascular wall healing Restenosis remains a major cause of failure after angioplasty and stenting for treatment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. New approaches are being developed that target thrombotic and inflammatory events at the site of vessel wall injury through antibody directed targeting of activated platelets.

Subsequent studies confirmed A20 as one of humans' most potent and ubiquitous physiologic anti- inflammatory molecules. A20 not only goes to the NF- B heart of inflammation, but also beyond to control IFN gamma and alpha/ beta signaling, and modulate cell survival and proliferation, with return to homeostasis as the ultimate goal. We established the therapeutic benefits of A20-based therapies in a number of animal models of human diseases that share inflammation as a central pathogenic component, mainly in the three fields listed below. Vascular diseases Our data qualifies a potent \"atheroprotective\" and novel anti-angiogeneic function of A20 in animal models of: Neointimal hyperplasia post-balloon angioplasty Transplant arteriosclerosis, the main cause of failure of vascularized allografts Accelerated atherosclerosis of diabetes Vein graft and prosthetic arterial graft failure Proliferative retinopathies, namely retinopathy of prematurity and diabetic retinopathyLiver regeneration and repair We have also extensively established a potent \"hepatoprotective\" role for A20 in the liver, stemming from combined anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and pro-proliferative functions of A20 in hepatocytes. Accordingly, A20-based therapies protect mice from lethality in models of acute chemically- induced toxic hepatitis, lethal radical hepatectomy where 90% of the liver is resected, prolonged warm liver ischemia, and orthotopic liver transplantation using marginal livers. Additionally, we uncovered an unsuspected phenotype in A20 heterozygous mice, whereby a benign 2/3 hepatectomy causes a staggering 50% lethality. These data have important clinical implications. Indeed, single nucleotide polymorphisms that negatively impact A20 expression and/or function should be recognized in order to gauge safety of extensive liver resections for donation or tumor. We also recently discovered that A20 regulates lipid metabolism in a way that improves fatty liver disease in a mouse model of human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Current pre-translational studies in pigs using clinically safe viral vectors to specifically induce A20 expression in the liver are very promising and prelude clinical implementation. Treatment of diabetes Islet Transplantation: A20 retained its anti- apoptotic and anti-inflammatory functions in -cells, thus was an ideal candidate to genetically engineer islet grafts for the treatment of diabetes. Insulin Alternatives: Recently, we uncovered a novel anti-diabetic function of A20, whereby hepatic overexpression of A20 in a mouse model of type I diabetes restored glycemic control in an insulin independent manner. We are characterizing the molecular basis of this novel function of A20 and exploring its potential use as an anti-diabetic therapy in both type I and type II diabetes.

Guzman, MD Associate Professor of Surgery Vice Chair, Resident Research RESEARCH GROUP Yujun Cai, PhD Tonghui Lin, PhD Susan WangRESEARCH FOCUS My research focuses on the role of arterial calcification in lower-extremity vascular disease. We are interested in the mechanisms by which smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall become transformed into more bone-like cells. This primarily occurs in patients with diabetes and renal failure. In previous studies using cell culture systems and rodents, we showed that the matrix- degrading enzymes known as MMPs are critical factors in the development of medial artery calcification and that reducing MMP activity could prevent medial calcification in vitro and in vivo. We have been working to better understand how MMPs promote calcification and whether these inhibitors can be used in the clinical setting to prevent vascular calcification in patients. During our work on MMPs, we found that a class of bone-related factors known as bone morphogenetic proteins, or BMPs, is up-regulated during arterial calcification. Through collaborations with several investigators, we have begun to study the potential role of new synthetic small-molecule BMP inhibitors in our calcification models. The ultimate goal of our basic studies is to gain insight into mechanisms that control calcification so we can develop clinically relevant therapies for use in our patients with critical limb ischemia. Through clinical studies we have undertaken over the last eight years, we have learned that the amount of calcification in lower extremity arteries is a better predictor of long-term amputation risk than demographic and vascular risk factors. More recently, our research has focused on the finding that extensive arterial calcium is associated with poor limb outcomes in a manner that is independent of occlusive disease. This finding is contrary to previous notions of how vascular disease affects lower extremity blood flow. Currently, we are evaluating the hypothesis that arterial calcification, perhaps by affecting vessel wall compliance, contributes to limb ischemia and increases amputation risk in vascular patients. Our ultimate goal is to develop pharmacologic therapies to decrease calcium accumulation, improve arterial wall compliance, and thus reduce amputations in patients with diabetic vascular disease.111 2018 Surgery Research Annual ReportA complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 My laboratory moved to Boston from our previous home in Nashville, Tenn. in 2013. Over the past four years, we have begun new and exciting research collaborations with several investigators on campus. We are particularly fortunate to have entered into a new collaboration with Aristidis Veves, MD, from our Division of Podiatry, Research Director of the Microcirculation Lab and Director of the Rongxiang Xu, MD, Center for Regenerative Therapeutics. We are working together to initiate studies aimed at understanding the relationship between arterial calcification and ischemia in patients with diabetes. We have recently demonstrated that the association between calcification and foot ulcers is independent of arterial occlusion. Because this association remains undefined, however, we hope to develop a large clinical data set on diabetic patients with and without foot ulcers to study this problem. We are also currently initiating new protocols that quantify arterial calcification in patients undergoing endovascular interventions. Our hope is that we can use this unique data set to gain a more precise understanding of why calcification predicts increased amputation risk. Our basic investigations have also been stimulated by the addition of Yujun Cai, PhD, Instructor in Surgery to our team. Dr. Cai has extensive experience in studies related to the role of phosphodiesterases in vascular remodeling. His work has been published in leading vascular journals including Circulation Research and ATVB. We plan to continue his work on phosphodiesterases as they related to osteogenic SMC transformation and calcification. Our hope is that these exciting findings will translate into novel therapies to reduce arterial calcification and in improve outcomes in patients with diabetes and renal disease.SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Zettervall SL, Soden PA, Ultee KH, K, Schermerhorn ML, Guzman RJ.

Our hypothesis is that MMP-3, induced by inflammation and elevated phosphate levels, promotes osteogenic transformation of vascular SMCs and medial calcification through both local and systemic effects.112 bidmc.org/surgeryVascular and Endovascular Surgery Frank W. LoGerfo, MD William McDermott Distinguished Professor of Surgery Leena Pradhan-Nabzdyk, PhD, MBA Assistant Professor of Surgery RESEARCH GROUP Daniel Creighton Mauricio Contreras, MD Patric Liang, MD Navneet Momi, PhD Akshi Thakkar, MSRESEARCH FOCUS Our group has been extensively involved in different areas of vascular biology, diabetes, and neuropeptide research: 1) evaluating mechanisms responsible for development of intimal hyperplasia (IH) in vein grafts and prosthetic grafts; 2) developing novel techniques to prevent IH in both vein grafts and prosthetic grafts using bioengineering methodologies' and 3) wound healing in diabetes. IH is the most common cause of delayed prosthetic arterial graft failure and delayed failure of vein grafts. As graft healing occurs, genes are either up- or down-regulated as compared to a quiescent arterial wall. Our lab studies altered gene expression that results in endothelial cell activation as well as cellular proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells, leading to vein graft IH and anastomotic IH (AIH). Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk's main research focus is diabetic neuropathic complications. Peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease are the major contributors to diabetic foot ulcers and their failure to heal. Therefore, it is important to assess the individual and combined role of neuropathy and vascular disease and their intricate interplay that leads to diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). To achieve this goal, Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk has successfully developed an in vivo diabetic rabbit model of ischemic and neuroischemic wound healing. She is conducting studies in rabbit models of wound healing aimed at understanding the role of neuropeptides in diabetic wound healing. Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk also collaborates with Aristidis Veves, MD, Division of Podiatry, using knock-out mice models to further understand the mechanisms underlying diabetic wound-healing complication. In addition to understanding the mechanisms underlying diabetic wound healing, Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk is also developing novel therapeutics to treat non-healing ulcers in collaboration with Dr. Veves, Dr. Paula Hammond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Dr. David Mooney of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University.113 Surgery Research Annual Report 2016-2017A complete list of publications begins on page 13.ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2016-2017 Based on their previous work, the LoGerfo-Pradhan group has identified gene targets that are upregulated in both vein graft IH and AIH. Current work is focused on understanding the biology of these molecules, including Thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) and interleukin (IL) -18, and developing techniques to deliver silencing RNA (siRNA) to the vessel wall to silence those targets and thereby mitigate the development of IH. Results from these projects have been presented at several national and international meetings and have resulted in manuscripts. Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk through NIH funding is also developing small molecule inhibitors for prevention of IH. In collaboration with Dr. Mooney, our group is developing novel heparin-based cryogels and hydrogels to which siRNA could be adsorbed. Their preliminary experiments suggest successful siRNA delivery to vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Moreover, these cryogels and hydrogels could be coated upon existing clinical vascular graft materials for prevention of prosthetic graft intimal hyperplasia. The diabetic rabbit model developed by Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk is being used not only to understand the mechanisms of this devastating problem, but is also being used to test therapies directed to improve wound healing. In collaboration with Harvard's Wyss Institute, Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk tested the efficacy of the neuropeptide Substance P that was encapsulated in modified alginate gel in neuroischemic wound healing. The goal was to deliver Substance P in a continuous manner for a period of 10 days using the alginate gel. In collaboration with Dr. Hammond of MIT, Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk is testing the efficacy of drug delivery to diabetic wounds through a layer-by-layer (LbL) system developed by Dr. Hammond. TEACHING, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION We have mentored several students and post-docs in the lab. Additionally Dr. LoGerfo is the Program Director of the Harvard-Longwood Research Training Program in Vascular Surgery NIH-T32 program and Dr. Pradhan-Nabzdyk is the member of the Training Program Executive Committee. Currently there are eight post-doctoral fellows in this program mentored in different labs in the Longwood Medical Area. Based on the success of the T-32 program and the past William J. von Liebig Summer Research in Vascular Surgery Fellowship program for medical students, we (Drs. LoGerfo and Pradhan-Nabzdyk as Co-Directors) received NIH T-35 funding in 2013 which was recently renewed for additional five years, 2018-2022. The goal of this T-35 program is to train medical students in vascular surgery research for a short (10-12 weeks) period.SELECTED RESEARCH SUPPORT Mechanisms of prosthetic arterial graft NIH, 1987-2021; PIs: Frank PhD; Co-Investigator: Pradhan-Nabzdyk, MBA Genetic engineering of grafts in vascular and cardiovascular Small Molecule Inhibitors to Prevent Intimal Hyperplasia; NIH, Co-investigators: Frank W.

Zettervall, MDRESEARCH FOCUS My clinical research group has an active interest in vascular surgery outcomes research on a local and national level. As emerging technologies evolve the way we practice medicine, comparative effectiveness research has been instrumental in the identification of best practices from among an increasingly complex set of therapeutic options. Our main interest is to compare outcomes after open surgery and endovascular surgery for a variety of vascular diseases, including aortic aneurysms, carotid disease, and lower extremity arterial disease, in order to help guide patient selection for each type of procedure. We utilize a wide range of observational, registry, and administrative data from real-world settings to better understand the impact of vascular treatments on disease processes. Our experience at BIDMC, boasting the world's largest series of distal bypass and tibial angioplasty procedures, provided rich data from which we have published on the effectiveness of primary endovascular therapy for critical limb-threatening ischemia and the benefits of statin dose intensities. We have used our institutional experience with novel imaging systems to show reduced radiation exposure and contrast dose for patients and providers. Joining other institutions in the region and nationally, we are an active participant in the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) and the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI). These large databases provide detailed procedural and patient-related information from which we have investigated regional differences in patient selection, treatment, and outcomes of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), carotid artery stenosis, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), among other vascular diseases. We have developed and published work on risk prediction models that can be used in real-world settings to guide physicians in counseling a patient on his/her individual risk of surgery. Through the VQI as well as other databases such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP), we shed light on disparities in presentation, treatment selection, and outcomes across both genders and racial groups. In addition, administrative data such as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a 20% sampling of all inpatient admissions, and the State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD), a database of all ambulatory surgical encounters by state, have been invaluable in addressing population-based clinical questions, including the epidemiologic trends in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia. Importantly, we have partnered with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) to obtain Medicare data for the study of open versus endovascular AAA management, including a comparison of different endovascular stent grafts for AAA repair. We have also demonstrated that late rupture after endovascular repair is a subsisting concern that merits further research. Finally, we have also combined data from several of these sources to comment on data quality, as in our review of the accuracy of administrative data versus clinical data for assignment of neurologic symptom status in patients undergoing carotid revascularization. Expertise in the use of these datasets against the backdrop of our busy clinical practice has allowed our group to produce tangible improvements in the management of vascular disease by translating clinical issues into tangible research questions.

This rich clinical activity has facilitated our participation in multi-center clinical trials in the areas of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, best treatment for critical limb-threatening ischemia, and management of carotid artery atherosclerotic disease. Such activity has kept our Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at the cutting edge of new advances in endovascular surgery and positioned us well to report on the effectiveness of these techniques in the literature. Beyond our institution, I have taken on leadership positions in the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE) and the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI), innovative quality- improvement initiatives at the regional and national level, respectively. The VSGNE, a consortium of over 30 regional hospitals, collects granular clinical data across institutions from which participants have published novel insights on the management of vascular diseases. The success of the VSGNE has provided a model for quality-improvement efforts nationally through the formation of the VQI, a cooperative of 18 regional quality groups in the U.S. and Canada, and endorsed by the Society for Vascular Surgery. As a member of the Executive and Research Advisory Committees for both organizations, I have worked with our research group to develop projects utilizing these data, resulting in many peer-reviewed publications. * Vascular Annual Meeting for the Society for Vascular Surgery (9 presentations in 2016 and 5 presentations in 2017), and the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery, Vascular Annual Symposium (11 presentations in 2016 and 10 presentations in 2017), Charing-Cross Symposium 2017 (2 plenary talks).
