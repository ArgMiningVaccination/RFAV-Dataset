The type and number of MTHFR mutations greatly affects the approach to care and the outcome of care. Treatment should optimize the production of methyl groups while decreasing the overall depletion. Genetics cannot be changed, but how genes behave can be altered with a comprehensive diet and lifestyle approach designed to support proper and efficient methylation. Supplementation is also a factor to consider, but is again, complex. It is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Here is an overview of common approaches to supplementation for MTHFR: Dr. Ben Lynch's Approach \u2014 Begin with low doses of B12 for several days, then add MTHF folate at a ratio that is \u00bd the amount of B12, increasing every several days until you feel better or experience [symptoms of overmethylation](https://mthfr.net/methylfolate-side-effects/2012/03/01/) (irritability, insomnia, sore muscles, achy joints, acne, rash, anxiety, palpitations, nausea, headaches, migraines). A good base recommendation is 400mcg of folate per day and double that amount of B12. Dr. Amy Yasko's Approach \u2014 Dr. Yasko's supplement protocol is a six-step process. 1. Balance supplements, including a multi and B complex. 2. Detox. 3. Balance lithium levels. 4. Determine ideal form of B12 (see below). Implement long-term support including titrating MTHF folate via drops. 6. Additional support based on nutrigenomic profile. A B12 deficiency can cause other health problems, so it's important to get the right type of B12. What type of B12 should you take? Here's a table that shows the best type based on the COMT and VDR Taq genes. types of \u2014 defects often cause high levels of homocysteine, a naturally-occurring amino acid produced during the methylation cycle and an indicator of efficient methylation. Dr. Braly believes homocysteine (Hcy) levels is the best indication of how well B vitamins are working. Your homocysteine levels should determine your daily nutrient needs as shown in the chart below. (As your health improves, the amounts of these nutrients you need may change.) |Nutrient||No Risk | H |Low Risk | 6-9 |High Risk | 9-15 \u2014 Dr. Pauling believes every sickness and disease can be traced to a mineral deficiency. Treating MTHFR requires a full combination of nutrients. In 2015, simply eating the daily-recommended servings of fruits and vegetables may not be enough. Some of the common nutrient deficiencies include: B vitamins (particularly folate, calcium, magnesium, iron, D3, K2, selenium, vitamin A, iodine, lithium, and essential fatty acids. Most of these are covered in a good multivitamin, but not all. Most multivitamins do not contain lithium, iodine, and essential fatty acids. Lithium is found in spring or mineral waters. Lithium helps mood and studies have shown that communities with sufficient lithium in the drinking water have lower crime rates, fewer homicides, less mental illness, fewer suicides, and higher rates of longevity. Iodine is important for thyroid function, a healthy immune system, mental health, breast health, and bone marrow. An iron deficiency can cause weight gain, decreased energy, depression, cardiovascular disease, poor cognition, and even some cancers. Selenium is an important nutrient that helps the body absorb iodine. A healthy ratio of essential fatty acids can reduce risk of breast cancer and symptoms of arthritis, allergies, heart disease, and depression. Elevated omega 6 levels contributes to inflammatory diseases, and in the U.S., elevated omega 6 is common. To bring your ratio of fatty acids back into balance, avoid processed foods and vegetable oils. Increase your intake of omega 3 foods like oily fish, certified fish oil supplements, flax, walnuts, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, broccoli, squash, and collard greens. Before adding supplements to your diet, talk to your doctor. It's best to add supplements one at a time to manage tolerance and watch for adverse effects.
