Yolanda Brown-Spidell Westland, Mich. Comparing President Donald Trump's performance to that of France's Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain in World War II is a bit of a stretch. Perhaps a more apt World War II comparison is the United States's disgraceful response to the U-boat menace off our Atlantic coast, in the Caribbean, and in the Gulf of Mexico in 1942. Despite watch-ing how the British dealt with the U-boats in the Atlantic for the /f_irst two years of the war, the U.S. failed to prepare, learn, or imple-ment eective countermeasures. It all sounds so familiar.

Her research found that Americans underestimate the gap between Black and white familial wealth, both past and present. /T_h at gap has remained relatively stable for half a century, but Americans tend to assume that it has narrowed over time. Other research may help explain why such misconceptions persist. Participants in one 2015 study were asked to imag ine America as having a population of 100 people, and to estimate how many would see their income rise from the bottom 20 percent to the top 20 percent over 10 years. /T_h ey guessed that 16 would make that leap; in reality, only one would. Of the respondents, young people and those who self-reported high socio economic status were especially o target. As the study's authors explain it, these two groups are particularly invested in the notion of social mobility\u2014the young rely on it for future success, and elites need it to jus tify their status as earned. Downplaying in equality, even un consciously, can help people preserve comforting ideas about themselves\u2014 and about their country. \u2014 Jack Segelstein, Assistant Editor To respond to Atlantic articles or submit author questions to /T_h e Commons, please email letters@theatlantic.com.

BY JENNIFER A. RICHESON or two days in early June, as America was erupting in sustained protests over the killing of a Black man, George Floyd, by police in Minneapolis, the most watched movie on Net/f_l ix was /T_h e Help. /T_h e 2011 /f_i lm\u2014which depicts Black servants work-ing in a uent white households in 1960s Mississippi, and centers on a white female journalist\u2014won acclaim in some quar-ters. But it has also been criticized as a sentimental and simplistic portrayal of racism\u2014 and redemption\u2014 amid the cruelties of Jim Crow. To ask what was going on here\u2014why people started watching The Help at a moment of deep racial trauma\u2014is to risk tumbling down a rabbit PM /nine.taboldstyleD I S PAT C H E SD I S PAT C H E S MSEPTEMBER 2020 /one.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyleDispatches the movie was newly available on Netflix does not explain everything. One reality that the Help phenomenon makes us recognize is the enduring power of mythology when it comes to American racism. The mythology takes many forms. Sometimes it involves a desperate grasping for ar-mation. Sometimes it involves a gauzy nostalgia. Sometimes it involves a willful ignorance. All of these strains, and oth-ers, are woven into a larger and enduring narrative\u2014 the mythology of racial progress. /T_his is a uniquely American mythology. Since the nation's founding, its prevailing cultural sensibility has been optimistic, future- oriented, sure of itself, and convinced of America's inherent goodness. Despite our tragic racial history, Americans generally believe that the coun-try has made and continues to make steady progress toward racial equality. Broad accep-tance of this trajectory under-lies the way our leaders talk. It also in/f_luences the way racism is treated in popular culture. When we think about the nation's racial history, we often envision a linear path, one that, admittedly, begins in a shame-ful period but moves unerringly in a single direction\u2014toward equality. As if we're riding a Whiggish escalator, the narra-tive of racial progress starts with slavery, ascends to the Civil War and the Emancipation Procla-mation, speeds past segregation and Jim Crow to the victories of the civil-rights movement, and then drops us o in 2008 for Barack Obama's election. Many people asserted at the time that America had become a \"postracial\" society, or was at least getting close\u2014maybe one more short escalator ride away. /T_his redemptive narrative not only smooths over the past but smooths over what is yet to come: It holds out the promise of an almost predestined, natu-rally occurring future that will be even more just and egalitarian. Thinking this way won't make the future better. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /m.sc/y.sc/t.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/o.sc/g.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc racial progress distorts our percep-tions of reality; perhaps more signi/f_icantly, it absolves us of responsibility for changing that reality. Progress is seen as natural and inevitable\u2014 inescapable, like the laws of physics. Backsliding is unlikely. Vigilance is unnecessary. It is obviously true that many of the conditions of life for Black Americans have got-ten better over time. Material standards have in many ways improved. Some essential civil rights have advanced, though unevenly, episodically, and usu-ally only following great and contentious eort. But many areas never saw much progress, or what progress was made has been halted or even reversed. /T_he mythology of racial prog-ress often rings hollow when it comes to, for instance, racial gaps in education. Or health outcomes. Or voting rights. Or criminal justice. Or per-sonal wealth. History is not a ratchet that turns in one direction only. Martin Luther King/uni00A0Jr. famously asserted that \"the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" And maybe it will, in the end. But in our actual lifetimes we see backward steps and tragic detours. /T_he protests that began in late May have focused on fun-damental questions of police violence and civil rights. /T_his sort of awakening oers great opportunity\u2014more on that in a moment\u2014but it is rare in our history, and challenges the nation's prevailing psychology. My own research as a social psychologist focuses in part on racial wealth disparities\u2014 particularly, what people do and don't believe, and do and don't acknowledge about those disparities. Unless people understand the systemic forces that create and sustain racial inequality, we will never suc-cessfully address it. But percep-tions, it turns out, are slippery. For the past several years, I, along with my Yale colleague Michael W./uni00A0Kraus and our stu-dents, have been examining perceptions of racial economic inequality\u2014its extent and per-sistence, decade by decade. In a 2019 study, using a dozen specific moments between 1963 and 2016, we compared perceptions of racial wealth inequality over time with actual data on racial wealth inequal-ity. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the respondents in our study signi/f_icantly overestimated the wealth of Black families rela-tive to that of white families. In 1963, the median Black family had about 5/uni00A0percent as much wealth as the median white family. Respondents said close to 50/uni00A0percent. For 2016, the respondents estimated Black wealth to be 90/uni00A0percent that of whites. /T_he correct answer for that year was about 10/uni00A0percent. People's estimates of inequality were not only far too low for every period, but the estimates actually grew more inaccurate the closer they got to the present. People are will-ing to assume that things were at least somewhat bad 50 years ago, but they also assume that things have gotten substantially better\u2014and are approaching parity. /T_he mythology of racial progress exerts a power ful hold on our minds. And the hold is very hard to break, as a study we recently conducted, in collaboration with the Northwestern profes-sor Ivuoma Onyeador, makes all too clear. Up to a point, this new study had the same basic design as the one just cited. But the sample group consisted only of white Americans. And before they provided estimates, a subset of the respondents were asked to read a short article about the persistence of racial discrimination. Exposure to the article had an impact. But here's the surprise: Those who read the article still estimated that, in 2016, Black wealth was close to that of whites. /T_hey simply plotted a more gradual slope of progress. In other words, if people accepted that progress had been slower than they'd imagined\u2014 the takeaway mes-sage of the article they read\u2014then they arrived at the idea that the past must not have been as bad as they thought. They did not entertain the idea that the present must be worse than they think it is. /T_he mind is a remarkable instru-ment, adept at many things, including self-delusion. Get-ting people to alter overly opti-mistic outlooks\u2014 at least in the domain of racial progress\u2014is not a straightforward matter. /F.sc/o.sc/r.sc/m.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /n.sc/a.sc/r.sc/r.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/s.sc /i.sc/s.sc a way for individuals to find meaning in life and to make life seem more orderly and predictable. /T_he narratives we tell about ourselves\u2014and about the social groups to which we belong\u2014help us organize how we interpret events as they unfold, and respond to them.

But generational change is not so simple. Young people's racial attitudes are more like their parents' than they may real-ize. (It is also the case that this \"solution,\" even if effective, would be very slow.) The mythology of racial progress is corrosive in count-less ways. It provides a reason to blame the victim: If we're con-verging on equality, then those left behind must not be trying. And it diuses moral respon-sibility for actively and signi/f_i-cantly reforming the American system: If we're converging on equality anyway, then why do we need laws and other mea-sures to promote it? This isn't some abstract worry. You'll encounter it every-where, once you're primed to look for it. /T_he mythology of racial progress animated the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in Shelby County v. Holder, the 2013 decision striking down a key section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Roberts wrote: Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramati-cally/uni00A0... /T_here is no doubt that these improvements are in large part because of the Voting Rights Act. /T_he Act has proved immensely suc-cessful at redressing racial discrimination and inte-grating the voting process. Since Shelby, multiple states have passed new election laws, including stringent voter-ID regulations, and purged their voter rolls. And the /f_irst-line remedy\u2014legal challenges demonstrat ing that these laws are discriminatory\u2014 is unlikely to prevent violations of voting rights. Similarly, even in upholding some forms of armative action in Grutter v. Bollinger/uni00A0 (2003), Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor invoked the narrative of racial progress: It has been 25 years since Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context of public higher education. Since that time, the number of minority applicants with high grades and test scores has indeed increased/uni00A0... We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today. Seventeen years later, this pre- diction seems at best naive. /T_hese Supreme Court deci- sions, dierent as they may be, rest on a rejection of the idea that systemic racism continues to make itself felt in Ameri-can institutions. They reflect a Court that sees society, both in terms of institutions and individuals, as becoming more racially egalitarian\u2014admittedly with the help of past \"course corrections\" that the justices believe are now or soon will be unnecessary and obsolete. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /m.sc/y.sc/t.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/o.sc/g.sc/y.sc /o.sc/f.sc racial progress is durable, and can survive many direct hits. /T_he moments in our history when it has fractured decisively have been moments when a sense of national disruption was deep and pervasive, and people could not avoid seeing the chasm between myth and reality. Such moments\u2014after the Civil War, and again in the 1960s\u2014are rare, but they can create significant opportuni-ties. I believe we are in such a moment now. Most Ameri-cans are disgusted and angered by police tactics and attitudes toward Black citizens. Police killings of Black Americans are nothing new, of course, but the urgent attention to law enforcement's behavior comes at a time when the country is also facing a devastating pandemic and historic levels of unemployment\u2014both of which dis proportionately aect minori ty communities. The year 2020 has not been a good one for America's \"master nar-rative\" in any of its traditional forms. And it has exposed, at least momentarily, the narrative of racial progress\u2014 automatic, continuous, requiring little real eort\u2014for the myth it has always been. This is the time to strike, the time to take audacious steps to address systemic racial inequality\u2014 bold, sweeping reparative action. /T_he action must be concrete and mate-rial, rather than solely sym-bolic, and must address cur-rent gaps in every signi/f_icant domain of social well-being: jobs, politics, education, the environment, health, hous-ing, and of course criminal justice. A window has opened, and acting fast is essential. It is possible that something has permanently shifted in the American psyche; we should hope that this is true. But his-tory and psychology suggest instead that this window of clarity and opportunity will close quickly\u2014it always has in the past. For one thing, suc-cess often proves self-limiting: Implement audacious new measures, and the tempta-tion is to dust o your hands in satisfaction and declare the problem solved. For another, as the historian Carol Ander-son demonstrates in her book White Rage, any significant advance toward racial justice will be met with a backlash. /T_he passage of the /T_hirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments was followed by the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings, and a new era of racial subjugation in the form of Jim Crow. The landmark legislation of the civil-rights era was followed by Richard Nixon's \"southern strategy\" and the ascendance of racial dog whistles as a central tactic of American politics. We should not think of the next year or two as the start of a decade or more of incremental progress. We should think of the next year or two as all the time we have, and a last chance to get it right. Jennifer A. Richeson, a 2006 MacArthur Fellow, is the Philip R.

Nor is it because, year after year, for a solid month before the Fourth of July, my neighbors and I all play the game \"gunshots or /f_ireworks?\" It is not because of the constant police presence, though that certainly helps with identifying it. I witnessed half a dozen police ocers re-spond to one shoplifting call, and that was after the accused had already been handcued. But still this is not the telltale sign of the hood. It is the trash. /T_here is trash everywhere, always. Nearly 8.5/uni00A0million people live in New York City, not including the tourists and bridge-and- tunnel folks who, in more nor-mal times, /f_low in and out on a daily basis. Of course there is an abundance of trash. But when I get o the train to walk to my therapist's oce on the Upper East Side, a neighbor-hood devoid of any of the character that makes New York City appealing, I notice that there is no trash on the street. More people live in this neighbor hood than where I live; presumably they are cre-ating more garbage, but their clean streets suggest other wise. A casual observer might sug- gest that the people who live in my neighborhood\u2014mostly poor, mostly Black, mostly immigrant\u2014take less pride in where they live. They throw their candy wrappers and used napkins, their half-empty soda bottles and unfinished pizza, their Styrofoam to-go contain-ers and paper receipts on the ground because they don't care about keeping their sidewalks presentable and livable. And this, the observer may argue, is because of a cultural de/f_iciency. /T_hey do not value this place, their home, because such value has not been incul-cated by their surroundings. Some of these observations have been turned into aca-demic studies that became the foundation for what we now call \"broken-windows policing,\" a theory that can be traced to a 1982 article in this magazine, which claims that if such minor infractions are allowed to fester, they serve as the prelude to much larger, more serious crimes. Little, if any, consideration is given to the fact that my neighborhood has fewer pub-lic trash cans than neighbo r-hoods such as the Upper East Side. On the walk from the train station to my therapist's oce, I see a trash can on every corner. /T_hey are fewer and far-ther between on the 10 blocks from my local subway stop to the next one, on the always crowded, always bustling Flat-bush Avenue. The city could put more trash cans here, if keeping this neighbor hood where mostly poor, mostly Black, mostly immigrant people live clean\u2014as clean as the neighborhoods where mostly auent, mostly white New Yorkers live and work and go to therapy\u2014were important. But then the city would also have to pay someone to collect the garbage from those cans. /T_he city's elected ocials would have to deem these resi-dents worthy of that expense. What these officials have deemed the hood worthy of is policing, and not because it is so much cheaper. Policing is a costly public service, but the one most readily available here. /T_here are undercover ocers busting drug dealers. /T_here are uniformed officers in patrol cars sitting on corners all day, all night. Sometimes they are standing next to huge, over-powering floodlights, warn-ing the criminals o the street. Sometimes there are raids, 10 to 15 squad cars deep, in which one or two people are arrested. /T_he police are always on duty. /T_he people here do not lack for police, the way they do trash cans. A casual observer may tell you that this is because there is so much crime in this hood. /T_hat the people here are law-less, violent. And it's true, there is violence here, just as there is violence anyplace where the people are stripped of the means to build a good life.

COURTESY OF THE ARTIST AND JACK SHAINMAN GALLERY, NEW YORK.Casual observers, who aren't always so casual\u2014they begin to include academics, media professionals, policy makers, presidents\u2014excuse the pres-ence of the police here, and in other hoods like this one, because their position is that in order to stop the violence of the hood you must impose the violence of the state. /T_he police are meant, in this view, to protect the people from themselves, to enforce the dis-cipline their culture lacks. In reality, the police patrol and harass. They reluctantly answer questions better suited for town visitor centers. /T_hey enforce trac laws at their dis-cretion, or to shore up munici-pal budgets through the impo-sition of exorbitant /f_ines. /T_hey arrest people who have dis-obeyed them and then make up the charges later. /T_hey dismiss the stories of rape victims; they side with domestic abus-ers. /T_hey break into homes via no-knock warrants. /T_hey intro-duce the potential for violence by responding to calls about loud music\u2014or counterfeit $20/uni00A0bills. /T_hey shoot and kill with impunity. Regardless of the other responsibilities police have assumed, they have consistently in/f_licted violence on the most marginalized people in society. /A.sc /l.sc/e.sc/s.sc/s.sc/o.sc/n.sc /y.sc/o.sc/u.sc learn fairly quickly while living in New York City and using public transportation is that if there is an empty subway car on an otherwise crowded train, you do not want to get in that car thinking you've somehow hacked the system. After one or two times believing that you've outsmarted all the other pas-sengers, you realize that the smell of the empty car is so repulsive, no person can rea-sonably bear it for any amount of time. Except there likely is a person in that car, and that per-son has likely been unhoused for some time. That subway car is their safest refuge. /T_hey have likely been riding for hours, having hustled their way onto the train at last, win-ning a swipe from one of the hundreds of people who have passed them by. They finally have a place to rest, but it has been who knows how long since they have been able to avail themselves of a bathroom, because in New York City all the restrooms are for custom-ers only. So they smell like the piss and shit that they've been unable to wipe from themselves, now caked on and causing other passengers to run away\u2014leaving them further alienated from any sense of humanity and community. Only they won't be left alone for too long, because someone else who is even more uncaring will not simply choose another subway car. /T_hey will see it as their right to ride unencum-bered by the sight and smell of this other person. /T_hey will call the police, who will arrest this person, and for a night or two this person will have a place to sleep, in a jail cell. The police cannot solve poverty, joblessness, mental ill-ness, addiction, and the hous-ing crisis\u2014the actual culprits in the lives of the unhoused. But if we've deemed homeless people, not poverty, the prob-lem, then what the police can do is make them disappear. /T_he major tools the police carry are handcus and guns; they can arrest or kill. /T_he police ARTWORK BY HANK WILLIS THOMAS.

And to grant them this authority, local gov-ernments can criminalize sleep-ing outside, or criminalize pan-handling, which begins to look a lot like the criminalization of vagrancy as part of the Black Codes in the era that ended Reconstruction. Governments can fund a separate police force for the subway system to punish turnstile jumpers, arrest women selling churros, and clear out more homeless people, while neighbor hood associations ensure that no new homeless shelters get built near or in au-ent neighborhoods. /T_he streets remain the only place for the dispossessed to call home. Law-makers, and those who aspire to become them, will continue to send the police to arrest the poor, because they respond to two groups, funders and voters, and the poor are neither. /T_he motto \"To protect and to serve\"\u2014adopted by the Los Angeles Police Department in 1955 and later used by other departments around the country\u2014 has been a highly eective public-relations tool. With the propaganda machine churning on, the police, and the governments that direct them, are able to get buy-in from the very people they are meant to police. People in the community hear the gunshots; see the addicts wandering hopelessly and the dope boys pondering their next move; grow fearful that a shouting match will turn ugly quickly; and have been taught by teach-ers, counselors, television, movies, and the police them-selves that the cops can solve this problem. So they call. They have no alternative. No one will even pay for them to have trash cans. How can a community deprived of the basics expect to receive the resources it needs so that it no longer has to depend on police? Its people have, purposefully, been given nothing else. When they ask, they are told to wait; when they shout, they are told that they are undeserving. /T_hey are shamed for the ways they have survived. /T_hey are blamed when they don't survive. /W.sc/h.sc/e.sc/n.sc /a.sc/s.sc/k.sc/e.sc/d.sc \"What would you have us do with the police?,\" I make a point of saying, unequivocally, \"Abol-ish them,\" because that is what I mean. I seek a world without police. When I explain that achieving such a world would require us to enact a number of redistributive policies and educational programs aimed at providing for everyone's basic needs and reducing violence, both interpersonal and state-sanctioned, I'm asked why I don't lead with that rather than the potentially alienat-ing \"Abolish the police.\" And my answer is that I believe in stating, in clear language, what you want, because other wise you are beholden to the cur-rent state of consciousness and accepted wisdom. I want a world in which the police do not exist, and there is no clearer way to say that. In the past, I have been accused of hating the police. And I do. Such an admission may be taken to mean that I hate each police ocer as an individual whom I have judged unfairly on the basis of his or her occupation. But I hate the police the same as I hate any institution that exists as an obstruction to justice. It's important here to de/f_ine jus-tice, as the U.S. legal system has perverted our sense of it. It cannot be punishment or retribution for harm caused. Justice is not revenge. Rather, justice is a proactive com-mitment to providing each person with the material and social conditions in which they can both survive and thrive as a healthy and self-actualized human being. This is not an easy thing to establish, as it requires all of us to buy into the idea that we must take respon-sibility for one another. But it is the only form of a just world. /T_he police have never been capable\u2014historically, pres-ently, either in statement of purpose or in action\u2014and, I believe, will never be capable of fostering such conditions. And so I hate them, because I have grown past impatient with injustice. I am incensed by the delusion, so prevalent among the country's suppos-edly serious thinkers, that tin-kering around the edges of an inherently oppressive institu-tion will lead to freedom. /D.sc/o.sc/n.sc/a.sc/l.sc/d.sc /T.sc/r.sc/u.sc/m.sc/p.sc /s.sc/w.sc/o.sc/r.sc/e.sc that he alone could rescue America, return it to glory\u2014a dismissal of community in favor of a narcissistic desire to be adored for an im possible heroism. It's uncomfortable to realize that, in dierent ways and to varying degrees, we have all bought into similar delusions. As a country, we obsess over the election of one person who is a part of one branch of our federal govern-ment. We become content to hand over the reins of deci-sion making to one person, whom we exceptional ize out of necessity, because we must believe that this person is the most deserving caretaker of our national present, and can personally bring about a bet-ter national future. (Liberals placed this misguided faith in Barack Obama and now seem poised to do the same with Joe Biden, positioning him as the savior of democracy.) Then we are left to panic when the country chooses wrong. For liberals shocked and outraged by the election results of 2016, it became popular, when speaking of T rump, to dismissively refer to him as \"not my president.\" /T_his is an empty rhetorical move, but one that allows the speaker a perceived moral high ground: She is not responsible for the current state of aairs, because this president does not belong to her. I suppose I shouldn't begrudge people their small acts of sanity preservation. But this one in particular reveals a deeper problem with Ameri-cans and our relationship to the presidency: the sense that in choosing the \"correct\" per-son for president, we have ful-filled our democratic duties. /T_he sense that we don't need to invest in constructing bonds of collective power and commu-nity outside the office of the presidency, because electing the \"right\" person is enough to ensure that the country will see real change. Flattering ourselves like this is part of how we ended up here. It's why all of our so-called progress has been hollow. It's why the so-called progress is so easily undone. /O.sc/n.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /t.sc/h.sc/i.sc/r.sc/d.sc /n.sc/i.sc/g.sc/h.sc/t.sc of protesting in Minneapolis, the third precinct was set on /f_ire. Up until then the protests, which had erupted in response to the circulation of a video show-ing the ocer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 sec-onds, killing him, looked famil-iar. /T_he scene was reminiscent of Ferguson in 2014, and Balti-more in 2015, albeit with face 0920_DIS_DenzelSmith_Incrementalism [Print]_13890872.indd 16 7/7/2020 7:07:07 PM16SOCIETY /one.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstylemasks meant to protect against the spread of COVID-19. /T_he people gathered and they shouted for justice. /T_he police stood guard outside. Once the vacated police station began to burn, this protest became something altogether different. The fire was a militant action that put the protesters in direct con-/f_lict with the state, while also representing the decidedly new demand arising from the nationwide demonstrations: Defund the police. \"Defund the police\" is an abolitionist call, part of a set of ideas to reduce the power of police in the short term, and to eliminate police and polic-ing in the long term. Abolition demands an overall restruc-turing of our economic and political order. It holds that de criminalizing those things that have been treated as crimi-nal matters but are not violent (the possession, use, and sale of drugs, and sex work, for example) would result in tre-mendous reduction of harm. This restructuring would also require a massive pub-lic investment in the general welfare\u2014 safe housing, healthy food, free education, free health care, a basic income. For those harms that would still occur in such a world, abolition asks that we /f_ind ways of addressing them that do not include the further violence of punishment, but prioritize the needs of the victimized to be made whole, and require the perpetrator to make proper restitution and to be rehabilitated so he doesn't commit harm again. The protests started out with the predictable demands of arresting, prosecuting, and convicting the police offi-cers responsible for killing Floyd\u2014and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky\u2014but shifted within a week's time to be about an overhaul of the entire system of American policing. For those like myself who have believed in and advo-cated for police abolition for some time, it was a moment of rich opportunity. And yet, as of this writing, it already seems to be fading, at least in actionable ways. As \"Defund the police\" gained traction as a slogan, cable-news pundits implied that \"Defund the police\" did not mean \"defund the police.\" Instead of spending time understanding abolitionist ideas, they inter-vened to say that \"Defund the police\" was in fact a request to \"re imagine the police.\" /T_he set of demands issued by the police-reform advocacy proj-ect Campaign Zero, branded \"#8cantwait,\" threatened to suck up the energy that was forming around defunding the police and divert it toward minor reforms that would have little impact on levels of police violence. While Minneapolis's city council formed a veto-proof majority to dismantle its police department, weak plans cropped up around the rest of the country, either to take away small slices of the police budget, as in Los Angeles, or to do things like ban choke holds and increase funds for training, as in Philadelphia. /T_his revo-lutionary moment seems to be turning into yet another /f_lash of progress. Perhaps I am being too harsh. Progress is progress. And progress is hard. Progress is wrestling concessions from the behemoth of systematized oppression. The problem is when progress becomes its own ideology\u2014 that is, when advo-cacy for incrementalism is seen as the astute and preferred mode of political transforma-tion. When we have done what is hard, and convinced our-selves that hard is a synonym for revolutionary. Incremen- tal change keeps the grind-ing forces of oppression\u2014of death\u2014in place. Actively advocating for this position is a moral failure. There have always been voices willing to take on the fragile American ego\u2014to remind us that the racist prin-ciples on which this country was founded continue to guide each of its institutions. At their most critical and potent, these voices disabuse us of the notion that America's foibles can be overlooked in favor of our inherent goodness. Yet American myth making has a remarkable, insidious abil-ity to swallow up the lives of those who stand in open rebel-lion to the American project and turn them into obedient symbols of American excep-tionalism. Martin Luther King/uni00A0Jr., for example, fought for the rights of Black people to be full participants in a democ-racy that had yet to be built. /T_he power brokers who would have opposed him now use him to ensure that the democracy he envisioned never comes to fruition. /T_hey adopted King as a historic cudgel, because you can make a dead man believe whatever you want. /T_his makes sense when you consider what James Bald-win wrote in his 1961 pro/f_ile of King: The problem of Negro leadership in this country has always been extremely delicate, dangerous, and complex. The term itself becomes remarkably di-cult to de/f_ine, the moment one realizes that the real role of the Negro leader, in the eyes of the American Republic, was not to make the Negro a /f_irst-class citi-zen but to keep him con-tent as a second-class one. /L.sc/a.sc/s.sc/t.sc /s.sc/u.sc/m.sc/m.sc/e.sc/r.sc, someone tagged a nearby subway station after it had gotten a fresh coat of white paint. /T_he tag read /m.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc /f.sc/l.sc/a.sc/t.sc/b.sc/u.sc/s.sc/h.sc /b.sc/l.sc/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc /a.sc/g.sc/a.sc/i.sc/n.sc.

The sky was a pearly blue, and thick, milky clouds hung above us like bulging lanterns. As we passed over the bridge\u20144.3/uni00A0miles connecting Maryland's eastern and west-ern and pulled back the sunroof. I hadn't realized how much I'd missed the feeling of wind rolling over my /f_ingers; the feeling of my entire family singing along at the top of our lungs to my children's favorite Disney songs. It was the /f_irst time since sheltering in place had begun, almost three months earlier, that my family was all together in the car for an extended period of time. We'd packed our masks, our sandwiches, and more Ritz Crackers than anyone was physically capable of eating. One never knows how traveling any meaningful distance with a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old will be, so my wife and I had emotionally pre-pared ourselves for tantrums and tears. But our children were well behaved, perhaps themselves simply grateful to be anywhere other than inside our home. /T_hey too seemed to relish the wind rushing past their faces. \"It is always a fact of some importance to know where a man is born, if, indeed, it be important to know anything about him.\" So wrote Fred-erick Douglass in his 1855 auto biography, My Bondage and My Freedom. I had been spending time with Douglass's work for several weeks, hoping that reengaging with his writ-ing might help me more fully understand how our country had arrived at this moment. A moment in which a global pandemic has torn away the veil and revealed the deepest /f_issures and failures of Amer-ica's promise to its most vul-nerable. A moment in which people of all generations and races have taken to the streets to demand an end to state-sanctioned violence. A moment in which the statues of white men who paved the way for genocide and fought to defend slavery are being taken down by cheering crowds. A moment in which Black lives matter has moved from a phrase laden with controversy to language at the center of our public discourse. A moment filled with rage, reckoning, and possibility. It was with these re/f_lections and Douglass's words in mind that, on Juneteenth, I got in the car with my family and drove from our home, outside Washington, D.C., to Talbot County, Maryland, where Frederick Douglass was born. In My Bondage and My Freedom, Douglass described the region of his childhood with revulsion. He called it \"thinly populated, and remark-able for nothing that I know of more than for the worn-out, sandy, desert-like appearance of its soil, the general dilapida-tion of its farms and fences, the indigent and spiritless charac-ter of its inhabitants, and the prevalence of ague and fever.\" He went on to say that the area was \"seldom mentioned but with contempt and derision\" and that, living there, he was \"surrounded by a white popu-lation of the lowest order.\" In 1878 Douglass returned to the county, and visited the farm that had once been owned by his master, Aaron Anthony, a man who may have also been Douglass's father. His grandmother's cabin had stood there. It was a place that had \"few pretensions,\" Doug-lass wrote. \"To my child's eye, however, it was a noble structure, admirably adapted to promote the comforts and conveniences of its inmates.\" But it was gone now. What did remain was an old cedar tree Douglass recalled from his boyhood. When he saw it, according to Dickson J./uni00A0Preston in Young Frederick Douglass, he declared that he had found the exact spot where he had been born. Doug lass stood under the tree in silence, and then plunged his hands into the earth to scoop up handfuls of soil to bring back to Cedar Hill, his home in Washington. At an event at the Talbot County Courthouse that evening, he told the audience he had col-lected \"some of the very soil on which I /f_irst trod.\" /I.sc/t.sc /f.sc/e.sc/l.sc/t.sc /p.sc/a.sc/r.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/u.sc/l.sc/a.sc/r.sc/l.sc/y.sc important to visit the county of Douglass's birthplace on a day meant to celebrate the emancipation of Black Ameri-cans from bondage. According to the historian and Douglass biographer David W./uni00A0Blight, Douglass \"viewed emancipa-tion as the central reference point of black history\" and felt that the nation \"had no greater turning point.\" As Blight put it, Douglass believed Eman-cipation Day \"ought to be a national celebration in which all blacks\u2014the low and the mighty\u2014could claim a new and secure social identity.\" With two toddlers, I was cognizant of the fact that I would not be able to gradu-ally trek through every place in Talbot County that had a meaning ful association to Douglass. My family's public- history tour schedule was dic-tated by nap times and diaper changes. But there was one place in particular I knew I wanted to visit: the court-house where Douglass had spoken nearly a century and a half earlier. We pulled up to the Tal- bot County Courthouse and walked across the lawn to a large statue. /T_he bronze ren-dering of Douglass stands atop an octagonal pedestal etched with his name. Doug-lass is captured mid-speech, his mouth ajar, his eyebrows raised in a spirited fervor. His left hand rests on a lectern. His right hand is lifted into the air, his /f_ingers bending back toward his body. His long, thick hair is pulled into the style so familiar from pictures of Douglass, the most pho-tographed American of the 19th century. While Douglass is known to have spoken outside the courthouse, it is also where he was held in a jail cell for two weeks after attempting to escape from slavery 42 years earlier. In the 19th century, enslaved people were sold on the courthouse's front steps. Douglass's statue was not the only one in front of the courthouse.

His hands were wrapped around the sta of a /f_lag, the bronze cloth cloaking his shoulder. While my family and I stood in front of Doug lass, others came to pose for photos with this statue. /T_hey did not take photos of or with Dou-glass, perhaps because they were attempting to practice social distancing, or perhaps because they had no interest. I wasn't familiar with the person standing on top of this pedestal, and though I assumed it was an American /f_lag draped over his shoulder, I couldn't quite make it out. After a woman and a young man had /f_inished taking pho-tos, I approached to get a closer look. Engraved on the front of the stone pedestal was: /T.sc/O.sc /T.sc/H.sc/E.sc /T.sc/A.sc/L.sc/B.sc/O.sc/T.sc /B.sc/O.sc/Y.sc/S.sc /one.taboldstyle/eight.taboldstyle/six.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyle-/one.taboldstyle/eight.taboldstyle/six.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyle /C.sc./S.sc./A.sc. It did not take me long to understand what C.S.A. stood for, and to understand that the /f_lag this young man was hold-ing was not the American /f_lag. The Talbot Boys were 84 local soldiers in the Confeder-ate States Army; their names are carved into the sides of the stone base. The statue, I would later learn, was erected in 1916, more than half a cen-tury after the end of the Civil War and during a period when the majority of Confederate monuments were built. /T_hese memorials were an effort to honor Confederate veterans, who were dying off in large numbers\u2014to teach younger white southerners about the war and that this generation of men should be venerated. They were also a physical symbol of white supremacy, an ornament in the landscape of Jim Crow meant to ter-rorize Black communities. In 2015, the Talbot county coun-cil voted unanimously against removing the statue; soon after my visit, however, the council president would introduce a resolution to take it down. I looked up at the statue, its bronze body glimmering under the sun, and then back at Douglass, about 20 yards away. My son was running in circles under the shade of a large oak tree while my daughter toddled after him. I thought of what it meant to have Frederick Doug-lass share the courthouse lawn with the names of 84 men who fought to keep people like him in bondage. The Douglass statue was approved by the county council in 2004, but it was not immediately installed. It took several years of delibera-tion and debate to decide how the statue should be erected\u2014resulting in a policy that the Douglass statue, and any other new statues on the lawn, could not be taller than the Talbot Boys statue. When Douglass's statue was finally installed, in 2011, many were glad to see it erected and thought it might balance out the Talbot Boys monument. But there is no balancing out those who fought to perpetuate slavery with those who spent their lives working toward its demise. Douglass himself was keenly aware that the story of slavery, the story of the war, and the story of emancipa-tion were at risk of being told in ways shaped by southern postwar propaganda rather than truth. As Blight put it, Douglass knew that historical memory was not determined simply by the passage of time; rather, \"it was the prize in a struggle between rival versions of the past, a question of will, of power, of persuasion.\" On May 30, 1871, just six years after the Civil War ended, Doug lass gave a speech at Arlington National Cemetery. \"We are sometimes asked, in the name of patriotism,\" he said, to forget the merits of this fearful struggle, and to remember, with equal admi-ration, those who struck at the nation's life, and those who struck to save it\u2014those who fought for slavery, and those who fought for liberty and justice. I am no minister of malice. I would not strike the fallen. I would not repel the repentant; but may my right hand forget its cun-ning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I forget the difference between the parties to that terrible, protracted, and bloody con/f_lict/uni00A0... We must never forget that victory to the rebellion meant death to the republic. We must never forget that the loyal soldiers who rest beneath this sod flung themselves between the nation and the nation's destroyers. I thought of this speech as I looked at the statue meant to commemorate these Con-federate soldiers. Doug lass feared that such statues might one day line the landscape of our country. But I wondered whether he could have imag-ined that his own likeness would stand alongside one, as if they were two equally moral sides of the same coin, both worthy of being lifted up and venerated. This is the problem with hollow attempts at \"balance\" in our public discourse. /T_hey mis-take balance for fairness. Sug-gesting that Douglass and the Talbot Boys are equally wor-thy of public memorialization might be \"balanced,\" but it is not fair; it is not just. /T_his war, as Douglass put it in an 1878 Memorial Day speech in New York City, was not simply a bat-tle in which two sides fought nobly for what they believed in. No. It was \"a war of ideas, a battle of principles/uni00A0... a war between the old and the new, slavery and freedom, barbarism and civilization.\" He went on: \"There was a right side and a wrong side in the late war which no sentiment ought to cause us to forget.\" In early June, 113 miles from where I stood, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam had announced that a 130-year-old statue of Robert E./uni00A0Lee on Monument Avenue, in Rich-mond, would be taken down. I had been thinking about Lee a lot lately, how central his name and likeness were to the iconog-raphy of my own childhood. Hundreds of statues, schools, and roads across the country are named after Robert E./uni00A0Lee. /T_he statue of Lee in my own hometown of New Orleans was taken down in 2017. I traveled down Robert E./uni00A0Lee Boulevard to get to school each day. I remember when, before its name was changed in the mid-'90s, there was a Rob-ert E./uni00A0Lee Elementary School that was attended mostly by Black children. /T_he veneration of Lee\u2014a slave owner who led an army predicated on maintaining the institution of slavery\u2014began immediately after his death, in 1870. Douglass was appalled. \"Is it not about time 4:16:33 chief should cease?\" he asked. \"We can scarcely take up a newspaper/uni00A0... that is not /f_illed with nauseating /f_latteries of the late Robert E./uni00A0Lee.\" The way Lee's legacy seemed to be taking shape gave Doug lass one of his earliest and clearest indications about how dicult the /f_ight against the propaganda machine of the Lost Cause would be. \"It would seem from this,\" he said of Lee's rise to saintly status, \"that the soldier who kills the most men in battle, even in a bad cause, is the greatest Chris-tian, and entitled to the high-est place in heaven.\" /M.sc/y.sc /c.sc/h.sc/i.sc/l.sc/d.sc/r.sc/e.sc/n.sc /w.sc/e.sc/r.sc/e.sc grow- ing restless, and it became clear that we would have time to visit only one more place before heading back home and hoping they might fall asleep in the car. As we drove toward Cov- ey's Landing, the roads became both emptier and more nar-row. The houses became less frequent, with more distance between each new address. On one side of the road, wheat fields stretched out in every direction, like a golden blanket had been laid atop the land; on the other, budding corn stalks shot up out of the soil. I remarked to my wife how striking it was to consider that so much of this land had once been plantation fields Black people worked on. How their spirits still sang over these large plots of earth. She mentioned a point we discuss often: None of this was that long ago. We sat with that thought as we drove on, the car spitting up gravel behind its wheels. In front of the last house before the dock, the Ameri-can flag rose up a tall staff along with a large blue /t.sc/r.sc/u.sc/m.sc/p.sc /p.sc/e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc/uni00A0/two.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyle/two.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyle /f_lag that whipped in the wind. I looked at my children in the rearview mir-ror, grateful for all they were too young to know. /T_he road ended at the water's edge. I parked and kept the car run-ning. I told my family I needed just a few minutes. I walked out onto a small wooden boat ramp and tried to take in my surroundings. /T_he air was thick and heavy. /T_he brown water was still but for the soft current that pulled ripples along its surface. On my right, a small tree jutted out from the shallow water, its branches bending down as if to drink. Across the river was a vast expanse of untamed, lus-cious green that looked like it ran out into the sky. I turned to my left and saw the river bend to its right. Douglass's birthplace was less than a mile north up T ucka-hoe Creek. The only way to get a close view of the land upon which Douglass spent his childhood is to get in a canoe or kayak and paddle there yourself. I thought of a young Douglass growing up here. Learning, over time, the unfreedoms placed upon his boyhood body. \"Living here, with my dear old grandmother and grandfather, it was a long time before I knew myself to be a slave,\" he wrote in My Bondage and My Freedom . I learned by degrees the sad fact, that the \"little hut,\" and the lot on which it stood, belonged not to my dear old grand parents, but to some person who lived a great distance off, and who was called, by grandmother, \"OLD MASTER.\" I further learned the sadder fact, that not only the house and lot, but that grand-mother herself/uni00A0... and all the little children around her, belonged to this mys-terious personage. I only had a few minutes to take in the space, to breathe in the air. As I stood at the edge of the dock, I craned my neck and stood on my tiptoes as if that might allow me to get a better glimpse of the land that Douglass had run over as a child, the land he had sunk his hands into when he returned as a man. I got back in the car, shut the door, and made a U-turn. My children quickly fell asleep in their car seats, and we switched from Dis-ney musicals to the news, trying to hear updates on what had transpired that day with the protests, with the virus, with our country. We made our way through idyl-lic neighbor hoods with open windows and color ful shut-ters. American flags hung from front porches. So did Confederate /f_lags.\"I am not of that school of thinkers which teaches us to let bygones be bygones; to let the dead past bury its dead,\" Douglass said in 1883. In my view there are no bygones in the world, and the past is not dead and cannot die. The evil as well as the good that men do lives after them/uni00A0... /T_he duty of keeping in mem-ory the great deeds of the past and of transmitting the same from generation to generation is implied in the mental and moral con-stitution of man. The next day, I scrolled through my T witter timeline and came across an image that left me breathless. Under the haze of dusk, activists in Richmond had transformed the Robert E./uni00A0Lee statue into a canvas blooming with new and reclaimed meaning. Garlands of grati wrapped around the statue's base, their anti-racist messages written in colorful letters that curled and popped on the pedestal. Projected onto the side of the 40-foot base was the face of Douglass, his visage enor-mous and striking, upstag-ing the darkened silhouette of Lee above him. Between Douglass's head and Lee's silhouette was a quote from Douglass that I think about often when I see the protests, in their myriad forms: \"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\" Clint Smith is the author of the poetry collection Counting Descent and the forth coming non/f_iction book How the Word Is Passed.I LOOKED AT MY CHILDREN IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR, GRATEFUL FOR ALL THEY WERE TOO YOUNG TO K NOW. 0920_DIS_ClintSmith_Statues [Print]_13898712.indd 21 7/9/2020 4:16:33 PM /two.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyleI LOOKED I LOOKED AT MY AT MY CHILDREN CHILDREN IN THE IN THE REARVIEW REARVIEW MIRROR, MIRROR, GRATEFUL GRATEFUL FOR ALL FOR ALL THEY WERE THEY WERE TOO YOUNG TOO YOUNG TO KNOW.TO KNOW.SEPTEMBER 2020 /two.taboldstyle/two.taboldstylePOLITICS drove 1,200 miles, from Philadelphia to Minneapolis, to be a part of the George Floyd pro-test movement. Throughout the city, from the predominantly white neighbor hood of Bancroft to the more diverse streets of Bryant, I saw signs in living-room windows that read /b.sc/l.sc/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc /l.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/s.sc /m.sc/a.sc/t.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc and /w.sc/e.sc /s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /f.sc/o.sc/r.sc /e.sc/q.sc/u.sc/a.sc/l.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc. As I drove up Cedar Avenue, heading to 38th Street, I also saw signs in the windows of stores and restaurants that read /m.sc/i.sc/n.sc/o.sc/r.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /o.sc/w.sc/n.sc/e.sc/d.sc\u2014an indication that these businesses stood with the Floyd movement, but also that they hoped to be spared should the protests turn violent. Pressed together with protesters adorned in masks, I stood on the unofficially renamed George Floyd Ave-nue, across the street from Cup Foods, where Floyd had been killed after allegedly pass-ing a counterfeit $20/uni00A0bill. As I scanned the crowd, I saw what I had seen in the other cities I'd visited as I made my way west: a shockingly diverse group of protesters. As a Black man, I found myself standing next to many people who did not look like me\u2014sometimes, their cries even drowned out my own. The coalition has changed. It has grown. Of course, not all Ameri- cans have embraced Black Lives Matter. Some look at the men and women demanding reform and see only looters and thugs. /T_hey are nurtured in this view by the president of the United States, who greeted the outcry following Floyd's murder with threats of violence against the protesters and tweets about \"LAW AND ORDER\" and the \"SILENT MAJORITY.\" Richard Nixon introduced the latter term to the Ameri-can people during another moment of ferment, one to which the current unrest has been compared. During the 1968 presidential cam-paign and into his /f_irst years in office, as anti-war dem-onstrations took place across the nation, Nixon sought to ostracize the protesters, paint-ing them as radicals whose views did not re/f_lect those of law-abiding Americans. The term, which he introduced in a speech in 1969, cut along racial lines: /T_he leaders of the civil-rights movement had become prominent opponents of the war in Vietnam, where a dis proportionate number of Black Americans were /f_ighting and dying. Martin Luther King/uni00A0Jr. went so far as to dis-courage Black college students from enlisting. Donald T rump borrowed from Nixon's playbook dur-ing his presidential run in 2016. During a rally in Las Vegas early in his campaign, he villain ized a protester by saying, \"I would like to punch him in the face.\" The rambunctious crowd cheered in response. In the months that followed, as his campaign stops continued to be disrupted, T rump turned the protesters into a useful foil: /T_he roaring crowd was us; the demonstrators were them. /T_hey did not belong to the silent majority, whose prerogatives T rump intended to restore. Enterprising supporters even created signs: /s.sc/i.sc/l.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc /m.sc/a.sc/j.sc/o.sc/r.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc /s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc/s.sc /w.sc/i.sc/t.sc/h.sc /t.sc/r.sc/u.sc/m.sc/p.sc. Months after the election, the signs were still available for purchase on Amazon, for the low price of $14.35, with positive reviews for the sturdiness of the paper. /T_he specter of Nixon's vic- tory in 1968\u2014and T rump's in 2016\u2014has haunted the George Floyd protests. By channeling Nixon once again, T rump clearly hopes to revive his political fortunes. Poll-ing shows that a majority of Americans view the protests positively. T rump's fractious response to the Floyd kill-ing, coming on the heels of his administration's bungled response to the coronavirus pandemic, seems to have left him badly damaged politically. Yet T rump has seemed dam- aged before. Some fear that, in the privacy of the voting booth, the American electorate will back the status quo over the calls for change in the streets. As of this writing, the protests have remained outraged yet largely peaceful. What if they PROTEST WORKS How the Black Lives Matter demonstrations will shake up the 2020 election\u2014and reshape American politics for a generation to come BY DANIEL Q. GILLION I 0920_DIS_Gillion_Protests [Print]_13899874.indd CLAIBORNE; GEORGE TAMES / THE NEW YORK TIME S / REDUX; BRANDON BELL; RAYMOND DEPARDON / MAGNUMDispatches turn violent and support for the cause they are champion-ing erodes? \"THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRON-GER THAN EVER!!!\" T rump tweeted in mid-June. But the silent majority need not be stronger than ever to reelect the president. T rump has to persuade only a small number of voters in a handful of mid-western states in order to win a second term. My own view, having spent the past decade studying pro-test movements in the United States, is that we've always overestimated the power of the silent majority, and that we're giving it too much credence now. Righteous, nonviolent demonstrations are a hallmark of a functioning democracy. They provide catharsis for the participants and show the nation at large that something is wrong with our society and needs to change. Protests can also spark that change, by channeling energy, resources, and votes to candidates who take up the cause. Even 1968, the year that supposedly proves the risk of backlash, fails as an example if we consider the presidential race alongside the congressional, gubernatorial, and mayoral contests that year, which swept reform-minded politicians into oce. Far from playing into T rump's hands, the demon-strators demanding justice for Floyd are engaged in a movement that is likely to aid those candidates who oppose the president's policies in November\u2014 and that could reshape American politics for years to come. /I.sc'/v.sc/e.sc /l.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc/e.sc/d.sc /c.sc/l.sc/o.sc/s.sc/e.sc/l.sc/y.sc at how protests and elections have interacted in America since the 1960s, and I've found that protests nearly always bene/f_it candidates asso-ciated with the causes being fought for\u2014helping them build bigger war chests, bring more voters to the polls, and ultimately win. Both the people marching in protests and those observ-ing them are inspired to con-tribute to candidates who are perceived as being com-mitted to change. Consider the wave of protests that fol-lowed T rump's inauguration. /T_he most high-pro/f_ile of these were the Women's March, the March for Our Lives, and the counterprotests at the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottes-ville, Virginia. But anti-T rump protest was widespread across the United States; hundreds of events occurred in his /f_irst year in oce alone. Zip code by zip Clockwise from top left: Harlem, May 2020:/uni00A0a rally against police brutality; Washington, D.C., May 1957: the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom, calling on the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v.

Spread across the nation, political activism was the source of millions of dollars in additional campaign giving. /T_his is not to say that pro- test doesn't inspire backlash. I also found a connection between liberal protests and donations to Republican candi- dates. But these contributions were smaller, overall. When liberal protests occur, all candi-dates make money. Democrats just make more of it. Protests likewise increase voter turnout. For example, although Black voters cast bal-lots in lower numbers in the 2016 general election than they had in 2012, the drop-o was less pronounced in areas where Black Lives Matter was active. And in areas that wit-nessed heightened levels of protest activity, Black voter turnout increased. All of this energy helps candidates affiliated with protesters' goals. On average, a district that sees 50 liberal protests in an election year sees the Democratic candidate in that district increasing his or her vote share by 2/uni00A0percent and the Republican decreas-ing his or her vote share by 7/uni00A0percent compared with the previous election. In a close race, such swings can be deci-sive. During the 2018 mid-terms, eight liberal protests occurred in the average con-gressional district. In districts with greater protest activity, liberal candidates fared well. Sixteen liberal protests in Charleston, South Carolina; 36 in T ucson, Arizona; and 43 in Miami helped Democratic candidates Joe Cunningham, Ann Kirkpatrick, and Donna Shalala flip seats in their respective districts. This was hardly the first time that protests had fueled successful challenges against incumbents. In the 1960s, for instance, the civil-rights movement and anti-Vietnam protests descended on Abner Mikva's Chicago neighbor-hood. Mikva did not imme-diately champion either cause, and he lost in his run for Con-gress in 1966. Over the next two years, during which Illi-nois's Second Congressional District was the epicenter of protest activity in the state, he reinvented himself as a strong advocate of the campaign to end racial discrimination in housing. He also acted as legal counsel for protesters jailed by an aggressive police depart-ment during anti-war protests. Mikva's embrace of these movements rattled Chicago's Democratic machine, led by Mayor Richard Daley, who infamously ordered the police and the National Guard to crack down on protest-ers at the 1968 Democratic convention. Mikva unseated a superannuated Demo-cratic incumbent during the primary and then roundly defeated his Republican chal-lenger, even as Nixon carried Illinois. Mikva was not alone: Democratic candidates across the nation bene/f_ited from lib-eral protest, which helped the party maintain control of the House and the Senate. Focusing too narrowly on Nixon's victory in 1968 has also encouraged Americans to overlearn another lesson from that year: that violent protest will necessarily provoke a backlash. The fact is, many protests turn violent when the supposed enforcers of law and order do harm to demon-strators, whether it's an Ala-bama state trooper fracturing John Lewis's skull in Selma in 1965 or Park Police dispers-ing the people who congre-gated in Lafayette Square in 2020. Voters understand this. While wanton, opportunistic destruction of public prop-erty can certainly undermine an otherwise righteous pro-test movement, nightsticks, rubber bullets, and tear-gas canisters can draw attention to\u2014and sympathy for\u2014a cause and those brave enough to advocate for it. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /p.sc/o.sc/i.sc/n.sc/t.sc /o.sc/f.sc /p.sc/r.sc/o.sc/t.sc/e.sc/s.sc/t.sc is rarely to swing a single race, however momentous that race may be. It is to change the terms of political debate, and ultimately to change soci-ety itself. And indeed, protest has always foreshadowed the most radical shifts in Ameri-can history. Protest calls attention to problems with the status quo\u2014and often spells politi-cal doom for those who have upheld it. In my research, I've found that frequent liberal protest in a given congressio-nal district increases the prob-ability that a serious Demo-cratic challenger will enter the race for that seat, whether it's occupied by a Republican or a complacent Democrat. Of course, those challengers don't always carry the day. But when they do\u2014when they are propelled into oce by a pro-test movement\u2014 they become its institutional allies, intro-ducing bills and supporting policies that re/f_lect protesters' concerns. In this way, protest not only aects electoral out-comes today, but establishes the conditions for change in the future. Abner Mikva went on to be a leading progressive voice for decades and helped launch the careers of Elena Kagan and Barack Obama. /T_he Floyd protests likely arrived too late in the 2020 cycle to push new candi-dates into the /f_ield, but they have shifted the dynamics of some races, helping progres-sive candidates win prima-ries and topple entrenched incumbents such as Repre-sentative Eliot Engel of New York, who lost his race despite the support of the Demo-cratic establish ment. We will continue to see the effects of these demonstrations in years to come. When protest occurs, we can expect that change is coming\u2014 change that re/f_lects the evolving will of the people.

T oday, she 's sounding the alarm louder than ever. BY AMANDA FORTINIprocesses. In 1991, Brocko- vich, then a /f_i le clerk at the San Fernando Valley law /f_i rm Masry & Vititoe, happened upon sus-picious medical records while sorting through a box of /f_i les for a pro/uni00A0bono real-estate case. She drove out to the Mojave Des-ert to investigate. /T_h e water was green. She saw frogs with two heads. Residents were su ering from nosebleeds, miscarriages, and cancers. She persuaded Ed Masry to take the case, and in 1996 they won a $333/uni00A0million settlement for 650 plainti s, at the time the largest toxic tort settle ment in American history. (Brockovich herself received a $2.5/uni00A0million bonus.) Brockovich, 60, is mag- netic, fast-talking, and very funny, not unlike her character in the movie, a portrayal she calls \"about 97/uni00A0percent accu-rate.\" On the early-May after-noon when we first speak via Zoom, she is in her home o ce in Agoura Hills, California, a sunny room with shelves full of framed photographs of her now-adult kids. She lives alone (she and her third husband divorced in 2015), save for her three small dogs, one of whom, a Pomeranian named Wiley, is yapping in the background. She tells me she has been working on an ABC drama based on her life, Rebel; she will execu- tive produce and Katey Sagal will star. Erin Brockovich grossed $256/uni00A0million worldwide, a success only partly attribut-able to Julia Roberts's charis-matic performance, for which she won the Best Actress Oscar. /T_h e movie made its namesake into a kind of American folk hero, \u00e0 la Davy Crockett or Mother Jones. (Every time her name /f_l oated up on my phone, it was like Annie Oakley had texted me.) Like most folk T wenty years ago, Erin Brocko vich was released, and the brash, unvarnished legal assistant turned activist at the heart of the /f_i lm\u2014 memorably portrayed by Julia Roberts in micro-miniskirts and ver-tiginous high heels\u2014had the surreal experience of becom-ing a household name almost overnight. \"Let me be the /f_i rst to tell you that life takes an interesting turn when your name becomes a verb,\" the real Erin Brockovich writes in the introduction to her new book, Superman 's Not Coming. \" To 'Erin Brockovich something' has become synonymous with investigating and then advo-cating for a cause without giving up.\" The first case that Erin Brockovich Erin Brocko-viched\u2014 the subject of the movie\u2014was her 1990s battle with Pacific Gas & Electric. /T_h e power company had con-taminated the ground water in the small desert town of Hinkley, California, with chromium- 6, a highly toxic chemical used in industrial ILLUSTRATION BY LAUREN TAMAKI 0920_DIS_Fortini_SketchBrockovich [Print]_13888511.indd 26 7/9/2020 4:25:12 PM26Dispatches SEPTEMBER 2020 /two.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyleheroes, her appeal is a popu- list one.

After the movie's release, Brockovich, who was already at work on another contaminated- groundwater case\u2014this one in the Latino farming community of Kettleman City, California\u2014 was deluged with emails and letters. \"I put my finger in the dike,\" she tells me, \"and I thought I might help stop its /f_low. I had no idea.\" In 2005, she left the law /f_irm to start her own company, Erin Brocko vich Consulting, which she runs out of her home; she advises people on environmental- contamination issues, consults with law /f_irms, and is a regular on the keynote-speaker circuit. She continues to receive thousands of emails every month. \"A mother writes me and says, 'I'm concerned. I live down in Florida. My daugh - ter was diagnosed with a glio-blastoma. I have heard reports that we had a solvent chemi - cal in our water. Do you know anything about it?' \" she says, describing a typical email. /T_he following week, another email from another mother. A few of these, and she searches her inbox for the town's name: \"I'm like, 'Holy shit. Ten people from that same community have reached out to me.' This happened to me over and over again.\" Brockovich is dyslexic and has a photographic memory; she prefers to see things laid out visually, so she started plotting the email inquiries on a map. One day, she looked at her map and counted 300 dots scattered around the country. She decided to make her work accessible to more people, so she digitized it and put it up on her website. Here, people can self-report health eects of envi - ronmental pollution, and /f_ind others reporting the same issue. \"I looked at it today and there's 13,000 dots on it,\" Brockovich says. \"It's like, \" /I.sc/N.sc /L.sc/A.sc/T.sc/E.sc /two.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyle, the country began asking similar questions as reports of exceedingly high lead levels in the water in Flint, Michigan, began to circulate. In April/uni00A02014, an emergency manager had made the disas - trous cost-cutting decision to stop supplying Flint with water from the Detroit system and make the Flint River its tempo - rary source while the city built its own pipeline. The Flint River had long been a dump - ing ground for industry; it also contains signi/f_icant amounts of bacteria and organic mat - ter, thus requiring high levels of chlorine and ferric chlo - ride to clean it. But Flint had an antiquated system of lead pipes, which the dis infectants corroded, causing lead to leach into the water supply of 95,000 people. Shortly after the switch, Flint residents\u201454/uni00A0percent of whom are Black, and 40/uni00A0percent of whom live below the pov - erty line\u2014started complaining about their foul-smelling and discolored water, plus a host of strange new health issues, including rashes, hair loss, and diarrhea. Eventually, they began emailing Brocko vich, sending her photos of their brown, yel - low, or orange water. She for-warded a few emails to Bob Bowcock, the water- quality expert she works with. Bowcock says that Brockovich has \"this ridiculous sixth sense about her\" and that \"nine times out of 10\" her hunches are borne out by his research. In late Janu - ary 2015, almost a year before President Barack Obama would declare a state of emergency in Flint, Brockovich posted about the \"Dangerous Undrinkable Drinking Water\" on her pub - lic Facebook page. When a water issue arises, Brockovich and Bowcock usu - ally travel to the city or town in question. \"My role is to quarter - back all the experts and pull all the science together,\" Bowcock says. \"Her part is to rally the troops and get the town orga - nized and conduct the town-hall meeting.\" But at the time, Brockovich was in Australia for work, so in mid-February, Bowcock got on a plane to Flint himself. /T_here, he found levels of chlorine that exceeded those of a swimming pool. Bowcock drew up a plan for Flint's mayor, the water municipality, and the Flint city council. \"We actually wrote a whole water protocol,\" Brockovich says, \"and the city told us to fuck o.\" Flint's issues grew out of a tangle of bureaucratic incom - petence, bad decisions, and racism, but the city is hardly unique. A 2017 study by the Natural Resources Defense Council/uni00A0(NRDC) found that \"contaminants that may harm human health\" were present in the tap water of every state in the nation\u2014often in poor com - munities and communities of color, which are targeted as sites for industrial plants and land - /f_ills. In 2015, community water systems had more than 80,000 reported violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the 1974 law that regulates roughly 100 contaminants. More than 18/uni00A0million Americans got their drinking water from systems that had violated federal lead regulations, according to a 2016 NRDC report. Brockovich's book\u2014at once a master class on water for the layperson and an exhortation to work for improvements in our own communities\u2014takes readers on a tour of struggling locales around the country. At Camp Lejeune, for instance, the Marine Corps base in Jackson - ville, North Carolina, residents were exposed via drinking water to numerous contaminants, among them TCE, an indus - trial solvent that can cause birth defects and childhood cancers. Brocko vich writes that so many babies died there in the '60s and '70s that a nearby cemetery had a section called \"Baby Heaven.\" Reading the book, one acquires a dispiriting sense of why water issues are so wide - spread and entrenched. The most obvious reason is that you can't see the majority of chemicals, so unless you have your water tested, you likely won't know a contaminant is THE MOVIE MADE BROCKOVICH INTO AN AMERICAN FOLK HERO, \u00c0 LA DAVY CROCKETT OR MOTHER JONES. 0920_DIS_Fortini_SketchBrockovich [Print]_13888511.indd 27 7/9/2020 4:25:13 PM /two.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyleTHE MOVIE THE MOVIE MADE MADE BROCKOVICH BROCKOVICH INTO AN INTO AN AMERICAN AMERICAN FOLK HERO, FOLK HERO, \u00c0 LA DAVY \u00c0 LA DAVY CROCKETT CROCKETT OR MOTHER OR MOTHER JONES.JONES.Dispatches SKETCH SEPTEMBER 2020 /two.taboldstyle/eight.taboldstylethere. But water problems are also fairly technical, requir - ing a grasp of chemical and legal terms. \"Water's not an easy discussion; it's not sound bites,\" Brocko vich says. \"It's a story.\" She explains that \"no two bodies of water on this planet have the same fingerprint,\" which means that each has its own particular problems. /T_hen there are the structural issues. Our country's infrastructure is antiquated\u2014some water mains are 50 to 100 years old. Of the approximately 40,000 chemi - cals on the market, less than 1/uni00A0percent have been tested for human safety. Science is often manipulated by companies that put pro/f_it over public health. In sum, industry pollution goes largely unsupervised and laws remain unenforced. The U.S. also lacks a national disease database where people can report their issues and connect the dots between illness clusters and environmen - tal hazards. In 2013, Brocko-vich joined T revor Schaefer, a young man from Idaho who had been diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 13, to tes - tify on Capitol Hill about the importance of documenting and tracking cancer clusters. Three years later, President Obama signed \"T revor's Law\" as part of the newly strength - ened Toxic Substances Control Act, but the current administra - tion has failed to implement it. Brockovich hopes her crowd - sourced digitized map will act as a de/uni00A0facto disease database. \"She's a pioneer in environ - mental investigations and with uncovering pollution sources,\" Schaefer, now 30, says. \"She's been so successful in exposing it.\" /A.sc/s.sc /B.sc/r.sc/o.sc/c.sc/k.sc/o.sc/v.sc/i.sc/c.sc/h.sc herself often says, her path was not an obvious one. /T_he youngest in a family of four children growing up in Lawrence, Kansas, a university town 45 minutes west of Kansas City, Brockovich was placed in special- education classes for her dyslexia. Her parents\u2014her mother, B./uni00A0J./uni00A0O'Neal-Pattee, was an editor of the Univer - sity of Kansas alumni maga-zine; her father, Frank Pattee, was a mechanical engineer who worked as a regional manager for the U.S. Department of T ransportation\u2014taught her to believe in herself and gave her a solid moral foundation that emphasized honesty and \"stick-to-itiveness,\" as her mother called it. /T_hose lessons, she says, didn't sink in until she worked on the Hinkley case. In 1978, Brockovich graduated from high school and enrolled in Kansas State University. She spent her /f_irst semester staying out all night and skipping classes, and when her father saw her report card, he made her drop out. She transferred to Wade College in Dallas, graduated with an asso - ciate's degree in fashion mer-chandising and interior design, then took a job as a manager at a Kmart store in Los Ange - les, but she hated the work and resigned after three months. She dabbled in the world of professional beauty pageants and was crowned Miss Paci/f_ic Coast in 1981. The following year, she met and married her /f_irst hus-band, a house painter, with whom she had her son and her /f_irst daughter. /T_heir /f_ive-year marriage was volatile, and Brockovich suered debilitat - ing panic attacks. When her husband got a job in the food industry that moved the family to Reno, Nevada, Brockovich was hired by a brokerage /f_irm there; one of the brokers was a man named Steve Brockovich, who would become her second husband and the father of her younger daughter. /T_hat mar - riage was tumultuous, too\u2014her self-esteem took such a dive that she had to be hos - pitalized for anorexia\u2014and lasted only a year, leaving her broke, pregnant, and shat - teringly lonely. Around that time, Brockovich got in a car accident that herniated two disks in her spine. But the misfortune proved fortuitous. Not long after, she met a biker named Jorge; he introduced her to Jim Vititoe, who repre - sented her in a lawsuit against the other driver. She lost, but she persuaded Vititoe to hire her. /T_he rest is, well, a movie. Brockovich and I speak for the last time in early June; the country is aflame with pro-tests about police brutality against Black people, and the pandemic shows no signs of abating. When I ask how she is, Brockovich tells me she is deeply sad about the murder of George Floyd. But, as is her way, she sidesteps any concrete discussion of politics. Her dad was a Republican, and her book emphasizes that it was Richard Nixon who started the EPA. Yet she also worked with former Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer on T revor's Law, a bipartisan bill, and she has been critical of T rump's EPA on social media. \"I never get into the politics of it. I'll pull my hair out,\" she says. \"/T_here's plenty of blame to go around everywhere.\" She believes that water is not a partisan issue but a human right: \"It doesn't mat - ter what side of the aisle you're on, the color of your skin, what's in your bank account.\" If Brockovich does have a discernible politics, it's her populism, her belief in people, her utter faith that they\u2014we\u2014can take matters into our own hands. \"People think when I speak to a community that I'm coming in with an agenda, but my only role is to empower the people,\" she writes. In her discussion of Hannibal, Mis - souri, where local women got ammonia banned as a disin - fectant, she includes a quote often attributed to Margaret Mead: \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\" Doesn't she ever get de moralized? After all, Hink-ley is almost a ghost town now because the groundwater con - tamination spread, and Cali-fornia currently has no legal limit for chromium-6. Seven years ago, she says, she did feel burned out\u2014\"It's just too much; it doesn't stop\"\u2014but then she stood in the delivery room and watched as her /f_irst granddaughter was born and thought, \"What will this world be like for her if I don't con - tinue to /f_ight? What legacy are we going to leave?\" And she felt reinvigorated.

Hun-dreds upon hundreds of people had gathered in front of the campus clock tower for the welcome event and /f_i reworks display. But despite the throng of students, Bereal didn't see any who looked like him\u2014and he wouldn't for another week. /T_h e university, like many /f_l agship colleges across the country, enrolls vanishingly few Black undergraduates\u2014 just 4/uni00A0percent of the 40,000 students are Black, and just 1.5/uni00A0percent are Black men. /T_h at can leave the few Black students the university does enroll feeling isolated. So last sum-mer, just before the start of his senior year, Bereal began work on /T_h e Black Yearbook, a project that aims to give expression to their experiences. It's not a traditional yearbook; through portraits and 100 interviews, /T_h e Black Yearbook shows the highs and lows of Black life at a predomi- nantly white college, both the beauty of the campus experience and the stress of having such scant representation.

It has lost its status as a global leader. It has careened between inaction and ineptitude. /T_he breadth and mag - nitude of its errors are dicult, in the moment, to truly fathom. In the /f_irst half of 2020, SARS-CoV-2\u2014the new corona virus behind the disease COVID-19\u2014infected 10 million people around the world and killed about half a million. But few countries have been as severely hit as the United States, which has just 4 percent of the world's population but a quarter of its con/f_irmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. /T_hese numbers are estimates. /T_he actual toll, though undoubtedly higher, is unknown, because the richest coun - try in the world still lacks sucient testing to accurately count its sick citizens. Despite ample warning, the U.S. squandered every possible opportunity to control the coronavirus. And despite its considerable advantages\u2014immense resources, biomedical might, scienti/f_ic expertise\u2014 it /f_loundered. While countries as dierent as South Korea, /T_hailand, Iceland, Slovakia, and Australia acted decisively to bend the curve of infections downward, the U.S. achieved merely a plateau in the spring, which changed to an appalling upward slope in the summer. \"/T_he U.S. fundamentally failed in ways that were worse than I ever could have imagined,\" Julia Marcus, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Harvard Medi - cal School, told me. Since the pandemic began, I have spoken with more than 100 experts in a variety of /f_ields. I've learned that almost everything that went wrong with America's response to the pandemic was predictable and preventable. A sluggish response by a govern - ment denuded of expertise allowed the coronavirus to gain a foothold. Chronic underfunding of public health neutered the How did it come to this? A virus a thousand times smaller than a dust mote has humbled and humiliated the planet's most powerful nation. 0920_WEL_Yong_Covid [Print]_13900462.indd 34 7/13/2020 5:42:15 PM34 /three.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyle nation's the pathogen's spread. A bloated, inecient health-care system left hospitals ill-prepared for the ensuing wave of sickness. Racist policies that have endured since the days of colonization and slavery left Indigenous and Black Americans especially vulnerable to COVID-19. /T_he decades- long process of shredding the nation's social safety net forced millions of essential workers in low-paying jobs to risk their life for their livelihood. /T_he same social-media platforms that sowed partisanship and misinformation during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa and the 2016 U.S. election became vectors for conspiracy theories during the 2020 pandemic. The U.S. has little excuse for its inattention. In recent decades, epidemics of SARS, MERS, Ebola, H1N1 /f_lu, Zika, and monkey pox showed the havoc that new and reemergent pathogens could wreak. Health experts, business leaders, and even middle schoolers ran simulated exercises to game out the spread of new diseases. In 2018, I wrote an article for /T_he Atlan- tic arguing that the U.S. was not ready for a pandemic, and sounded warnings about the fragility of the nation's health-care system and the slow process of creating a vaccine. But the COVID-19 debacle has also touched\u2014and implicated\u2014 nearly every other facet of American society: its shortsighted leadership, its disregard for expertise, its racial inequities, its social-media culture, and its fealty to a dangerous strain of individualism. SARS-CoV-2 is something of an anti-Goldilocks virus: just bad enough in every way. Its symptoms can be severe enough to kill millions but are often mild enough to allow infections to move undetected through a population. It spreads quickly enough to overload hospitals, but slowly enough that statistics don't spike until too late. /T_hese traits made the virus harder to control, but they also softened the pandemic's punch. SARS-CoV-2 is neither as lethal as some other coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, nor as contagious as measles. Dead-lier pathogens almost certainly exist. Wild animals harbor an estimated 40,000 unknown viruses, a quarter of which could potentially jump into humans. How will the U.S. fare when \"we can't even deal with a starter pandemic?,\" Zeynep T ufekci, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina and an Atlantic contributing writer, asked me. Despite its epochal eects, COVID-19 is merely a harbinger of worse plagues to come. /T_he U.S. cannot prepare for these inevitable crises if it returns to normal, as many of its people ache to do. Normal led to this. Normal was a world ever more prone to a pandemic but ever less ready for one. To avert another catastrophe, the U.S. needs to grapple with all the ways normal failed us. It needs a full accounting of every recent misstep and foundational sin, every unattended weakness and unheeded warning, every fester ing wound and reopened scar. /A.sc /p.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc/e.sc/m.sc/i.sc/c.sc /c.sc/a.sc/n.sc /b.sc/e.sc /p.sc/r.sc/e.sc/v.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/d.sc in two ways: Stop an infection from ever arising, or stop an infection from becoming thousands more. /T_he /f_irst way is likely impossible. /T_here are sim-ply too many viruses and too many animals that harbor them. Bats alone could host thousands of unknown corona viruses; in some Chinese caves, one out of every 20 bats is infected. Many people live near these caves, shelter in them, or collect guano from them for fertilizer. /T_housands of bats also /f_ly over these people's villages and roost in their homes, creating opportuni-ties for the bats' viral stowaways to spill over into human hosts. Based on antibody testing in rural parts of China, Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance, a nonpro/f_it that studies emerging dis-eases, estimates that such viruses infect a substantial number of people every year. \"Most infected people don't know about it, and most of the viruses aren't transmissible,\" Daszak says. But it takes just one transmissible virus to start a pandemic. Sometime in late 2019, the wrong virus left a bat and ended up, perhaps via an intermediate host, in a human\u2014and another, and another. Eventually it found its way to the Huanan seafood market, and jumped into dozens of new hosts in an explosive super-spreading event. /T_he COVID-19 pandemic had begun. \"/T_here is no way to get spillover of everything to zero,\" Colin Carlson, an ecologist at Georgetown University, told me.

Carlson said the biggest factors behind spillovers are land-use change and climate change, both of which are hard to control. Our species has relentlessly expanded into previously wild spaces. /T_hrough intensive agriculture, habitat destruction, and rising temperatures, we have uprooted the planet's animals, forcing them into new and narrower ranges that are on our own door-steps. Humanity has squeezed the world's wildlife in a crushing grip\u2014and viruses have come bursting out. Curtailing those viruses after they spill over is more feasible, but requires knowledge, transparency, and decisiveness that were lacking in 2020. Much about corona viruses is still unknown. /T_here are no surveillance networks for detecting them as there are for in/f_luenza. /T_here are no approved treatments or vaccines. Corona viruses were formerly a niche family, of mainly veterinary importance. Four decades ago, just 60 or so scientists attended the /f_irst international meeting on coronaviruses. /T_heir ranks swelled after SARS swept the world in 2003, but quickly dwindled as a spike in funding vanished. /T_he same thing happened after MERS emerged in 2012. /T_his year, the world's corona virus experts\u2014and there still aren't many\u2014had to postpone their tri ennial conference in the Netherlands because SARS-CoV-2 made /f_lying too risky. In the age of cheap air travel, an outbreak that begins on one continent can easily reach the others. SARS already demonstrated that in 2003, and more than twice as many people now travel by plane every year. To avert a pandemic, aected nations must alert their neighbors quickly. In 2003, China covered up the early spread of SARS, allowing the new disease to gain a foothold, and in 2020, history repeated itself. /T_he Chinese government down-played the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was spreading among humans, and only con/f_irmed as much on January/uni00A020, after mil-lions had traveled around the country for the lunar new year. Doctors who tried to raise the alarm were censured and threat-ened. One, Li Wenliang, later died of COVID-19. /T_he World Health Organization initially parroted China's line and did not declare a public-health emergency of international concern until January/uni00A030. By then, an estimated 10,000 people in 20 countries had been infected, and the virus was spreading fast. /T_he United States has correctly castigated China for its duplic- ity and the WHO for its laxity\u2014but the U.S. has also failed the inter national community. Under President Donald T rump, the U.S. has withdrawn from several international partnerships and antagonized its allies. It has a seat on the WHO's executive board, but left that position empty for more than two years, only /f_illing it this May, when the pandemic was in full swing. Since 2017, T rump has pulled more than 30 staers out of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's oce in China, who could have warned about the spreading corona virus. Last July, he defunded an American epidemiologist embedded within China's CDC. America First was America oblivious. Even after warnings reached the U.S., they fell on the wrong ears. Since before his election, T rump has cavalierly dismissed expertise and evidence. He filled his administration with in experienced newcomers, while depicting career civil servants as part of a \"deep state.\" In 2018, he dismantled an oce that had been assembled speci/f_ically to prepare for nascent pandem-ics. American intelligence agencies warned about the corona-virus threat in January, but T rump habitually disregards intel-ligence brie/f_ings. /T_he secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, oered similar counsel, and was twice ignored. Being prepared means being ready to spring into action, \"so that when something like this happens, you're moving quickly,\" Ronald Klain, who coordinated the U.S. response to the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014, told me. \"By early February, we should have triggered a series of actions, precisely zero of which were taken.\" T rump could have spent those crucial early weeks mass-producing tests to detect the virus, asking compa-nies to manufacture protective equipment and ventilators, and otherwise steeling the nation for the worst. Instead, he focused on the border. On January/uni00A031, T rump announced that the U.S. would bar entry to foreigners who had recently been in China, and urged Americans to avoid going there. T ravel bans make intuitive sense, because travel obviously enables the spread of a virus. But in practice, travel bans are woefully inecient at restricting either travel or viruses. /T_hey prompt people to seek indirect routes via third-party countries, or to deliberately hide their symptoms. /T_hey are often porous: T rump's included numerous exceptions, and allowed tens of thousands of people to enter from China. Ironically, they create travel: When T rump later announced a ban on /f_lights from continental Europe, a surge of travelers packed America's airports in a rush to beat the incom-ing restrictions.

A president who is fixated on an in e ectual border wall, and has portrayed asylum seekers as vec-tors of disease, was always going to reach for travel bans as a /f_i rst resort. And Americans who bought into his rhetoric of xeno-phobia and isolationism were going to be especially susceptible to thinking that simple entry controls were a panacea. And so the U.S. wasted its best chance of restraining COVID-19. Although the disease /f_i rst arrived in the U.S. in mid-January, genetic evidence shows that the speci/f_i c viruses that triggered the /f_i rst big outbreaks, in Washington State, didn't land until mid-February. /T_h e country could have used that time to prepare. Instead, T rump, who had spent his entire presi-dency learning that he could say whatever he wanted without consequence, assured Americans that \"the corona virus is very much under control,\" and \"like a miracle, it will disappear.\" With impunity, T rump lied. With impunity, the virus spread. On February 26, T rump asserted that cases were \"going to be down to close to zero.\" Over the next two months, at least 1/uni00A0mil-lion Americans were infected. /A.sc/s.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /c.sc/o.sc/r.sc/o.sc/n.sc/a.sc /v.sc/i.sc/r.sc/u.sc/s.sc established itself in the U.S., it found a nation through which it could spread easily, without being detected. For years, Pardis Sabeti, a virologist at the Broad Insti-tute of Harvard and MIT, has been trying to create a surveil-lance network that would allow hospitals in every major U.S. city to quickly track new viruses through genetic sequencing. Had that network existed, once Chinese scientists published SARS-CoV-2's genome on January/uni00A011, every American hospi-tal would have been able to develop its own diagnostic test in preparation for the virus's arrival. \"I spent a lot of time trying to convince many funders to fund it,\" Sabeti told me. \"I never got anywhere.\" /T_h e CDC developed and distributed its own diagnostic tests in late January. /T_h ese proved useless because of a faulty chemical component. Tests were in such short supply, and the criteria for getting them were so laughably stringent, that by the end of Feb-ruary, tens of thousands of Americans had likely been infected but only hundreds had been tested. /T_h e o cial data were so clearly wrong that /T_h e Atlantic developed its own volunteer- led initiative\u2014 the COVID T racking Project\u2014to count cases. Diagnostic tests are easy to make, so the U.S. failing to create one seemed inconceivable. Worse, it had no Plan/uni00A0B. Private labs were strangled by FDA bureaucracy. Meanwhile, Sabeti's lab developed a diagnostic test in mid-January and sent it to col-leagues in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Senegal. \"We had working diagnostics in those countries well before we did in any U.S. states,\" she told me. It's hard to overstate how thoroughly the testing debacle in capacitated the U.S. People with debilitating symptoms couldn't /f_i nd out what was wrong with them. Health o cials couldn't cut o chains of transmission by identifying people who were sick and asking them to isolate themselves.

Pollutants and pathogens built up indoors, \"ushering in the era of 'sick build-ings,' \" says Joseph Allen, who studies environmental health at Harvard's T. H. Chan School of Public Health. Energy eciency is a pillar of modern climate policy, but there are ways to achieve it without sacri/f_icing well-being. \"We lost our way over the years and stopped designing buildings for people,\" Allen says. /T_he indoor spaces in which Americans spend 87/uni00A0percent of their time became staging grounds for super-spreading events. One study showed that the odds of catching the virus from an infected person are roughly 19 times higher indoors than in open air. Shielded from the elements and among crowds clustered in prolonged proximity, the corona virus ran ram-pant in the conference rooms of a Boston hotel, the cabins of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and a church hall in Washington State where a choir practiced for just a few hours. The hardest-hit buildings were those that had been jammed with people for decades: prisons. Between harsher punishments doled out in the War on Drugs and a tough-on-crime mindset that prizes retribution over rehabilitation, America's incarcerated population has swelled sevenfold since the 1970s, to about 2.3/uni00A0million. /T_he U.S. imprisons /f_ive to 18 times more people per capita than other Western democracies. Many American prisons are packed beyond capacity, making social distancing im possible. Soap is often scarce. Inevitably, the corona virus ran amok. By June, two American prisons each accounted for more cases than all of New Zealand. One, Marion Correctional Institution, in Ohio, had more than 2,000 cases among inmates despite having a capacity of 1,500. Other densely packed facilities were also besieged. Amer- ica's nursing homes and long-term-care facilities house less than 1/uni00A0percent of its people, but as of mid-June, they accounted for 40/uni00A0percent of its corona virus deaths. More than 50,000 residents and sta have died. At least 250,000 more have been infected. /T_hese grim /f_igures are a re/f_lection not just of the greater harms that COVID-19 in/f_licts upon elderly physiology, but also of the care the elderly receive. Before the pandemic, three in four nursing homes were understaed, and four in /f_ive had recently been cited for failures in infection control. /T_he T rump administration's policies have exacerbated the problem by reducing the in/f_lux of immigrants, who make up a quarter of long-term caregivers. Even though a Seattle nursing home was one of the /f_irst COVID-19 hot spots in the U.S., similar facilities weren't provided with tests and protective equipment. Rather than girding these facilities against the pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services paused nursing-home inspec-tions in March, passing the buck to the states. Some nursing homes avoided the virus because their owners immediately stopped visitations, or paid caregivers to live on-site. But in others, sta stopped working, scared about infecting their charges or becoming infected themselves.

America's neglect of nursing homes and prisons, its sick build- ings, and its botched deployment of tests are all indicative of its problematic attitude toward health: \"Get hospitals ready and wait for sick people to show,\" as Sheila Davis, the CEO of the non-pro/f_it Partners in Health, puts it. \"Especially in the beginning, we catered our entire [COVID-19] response to the 20/uni00A0percent of people who required hospitalization, rather than preventing transmission in the community.\" /T_he latter is the job of the public-health system, which prevents sickness in populations instead of merely treating it in individuals. /T_hat system pairs uneasily with a national temperament that views health as a matter of personal responsibility rather than a collective good. At the end of the 20th century, public-health improvements meant that Americans were living an average of 30 years longer than they were at the start of it. Maternal mortality had fallen by 99/uni00A0percent; infant mortality by 90/uni00A0percent. Forti/f_ied foods all but eliminated rickets and goiters. Vaccines eradicated smallpox and polio, and brought measles, diphtheria, and rubella to heel. /T_hese measures, coupled with antibiotics and better sanitation, curbed infectious diseases to such a degree that some scientists predicted they would soon pass into history. But instead, these achievements brought complacency. \"As public health did its job, it became a target\" of budget cuts, says Lori Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Ocials. Today, the U.S. spends just 2.5/uni00A0percent of its gigantic health- care budget on public health. Underfunded health departments were already struggling to deal with opioid addiction, climbing obesity rates, contaminated water, and easily preventable diseases. Last year saw the most measles cases since 1992. In 2018, the U.S. had 115,000 cases of syphilis and 580,000 cases of gonorrhea\u2014 numbers not seen in almost three decades. It has 1.7/uni00A0million cases of chlamydia, the highest number ever recorded. Since the last recession, in 2009, chronically strapped local health departments have lost 55,000 jobs\u2014a quarter of their workforce. When COVID-19 arrived, the economic downturn forced overstretched departments to furlough more employees. When states needed battalions of public-health workers to /f_ind infected people and trace their contacts, they had to hire and train people from scratch. In May, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan asserted that his state would soon have enough people to trace 10,000 contacts every day. Last year, as Ebola tore through the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2014a country with a quarter of Maryland's wealth and an active war zone\u2014local health workers and the WHO traced twice as many people. /R.sc/i.sc/p.sc/p.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /u.sc/n.sc/i.sc/m.sc/p.sc/e.sc/d.sc/e.sc/d.sc /t.sc/h.sc/r.sc/o.sc/u.sc/g.sc/h.sc American communities, the corona virus created thousands of sickly hosts that it then rode into America's hospitals. It should have found facilities armed with state-of-the-art medical technologies, detailed pandemic plans, and ample supplies of protective equipment and life-saving medicines. Instead, it found a brittle system in danger of collapse. Compared with the average wealthy nation, America spends nearly twice as much of its national wealth on health care, about a quarter of which is wasted on inecient care, unnecessary treat-ments, and administrative chicanery. /T_he U.S. gets little bang for its exorbitant buck. It has the lowest life-expectancy rate of comparable countries, the highest rates of chronic disease, and the fewest doctors per person. /T_his pro/f_it-driven system has scant incentive to invest in spare beds, stockpiled supplies, peacetime drills, and layered contingency plans\u2014the essence of pandemic preparedness. America's hospitals have been pruned and stretched by market forces to run close to full capacity, with little ability to adapt in a crisis. When hospitals do create pandemic plans, they tend to /f_ight the last war. After 2014, several centers created specialized treat-ment units designed for Ebola\u2014a highly lethal but not very con-tagious disease. /T_hese units were all but useless against a highly transmissible airborne virus like SARS-CoV-2. Nor were hospitals ready for an outbreak to drag on for months. Emergency plans assumed that sta could endure a few days of exhausting condi-tions, that supplies would hold, and that hard-hit centers could be supported by unaected neighbors. \"We're designed for discrete LEFT: HEALTH-CARE WORKERS SURROUND A COVID-19 PATIENT AT LENOX HILL HOSPITAL, IN MANHATTAN.

It is a 50-state catastrophe that will likely continue at least until a vaccine is ready. Wherever the corona virus arrived, hospitals reeled. Several states asked medical students to graduate early, reenlisted retired doctors, and deployed dermatologists to emergency departments. Doctors and nurses endured grueling shifts, their faces chapped and bloody when they /f_i nally do ed their protective equipment. Soon, that equipment\u2014 masks, respirators, gowns, gloves\u2014started running out. American hospitals operate on a just-in-time economy. /T_h ey acquire the goods they need in the moment through labyrinthine supply chains that wrap around the world in tangled lines, from countries with cheap labor to richer nations like the U.S. /T_h e lines are invisible until they snap. About half of the world's face masks, for example, are made in China, some of them in Hubei province. When that region became the pandemic epicenter, the mask supply shriveled just as global demand spiked. /T_h e T rump administration turned to a larder of medical supplies called the Strategic National Stockpile, only to /f_i nd that the 100/uni00A0million respirators and masks that had been dispersed during the 2009 /f_l u pandemic were never replaced. Just 13/uni00A0million respirators were left. In April, four in five frontline nurses said they didn't have enough protective equipment. Some solicited donations from the public, or navigated a morass of back-alley deals and internet scams. Others fashioned their own surgical masks from bandannas and gowns from garbage bags. /T_h e supply of naso pharyngeal swabs that are used in every diagnostic test also ran low, because one of the largest manufacturers is based in Lombardy, Italy\u2014initially the COVID-19 capital of Europe. About 40/uni00A0percent of critical-care drugs, including antibiotics and painkillers, became scarce because they depend on manufacturing lines that begin in China and India. Once a vaccine is ready, there might not be enough vials to put it in, because of the long-running global shortage of medical-grade glass\u2014literally, a bottle-neck bottleneck. /T_h e federal government could have mitigated those problems by buying supplies at economies of scale and distributing them accord-ing to need. Instead, in March, T rump told America's governors to \"try getting it yourselves.\" As usual, health care was a matter of capitalism and connections. In New York, rich hospitals bought their way out of their protective-equipment shortfall, while neigh-bors in poorer, more diverse parts of the city rationed their supplies. While the president prevaricated, Americans acted. Businesses sent their employees home. People practiced social distancing, even before T rump /f_i nally declared a national emergency on March/uni00A013, and before governors and mayors subsequently issued formal stay-at-home orders, or closed schools, shops, and restaurants. A study showed that the U.S. could have averted 36,000 COVID-19 deaths if leaders had enacted social-distancing measures just a week earlier. But better late than never: By collectively reducing the spread of the virus, America /f_l attened the curve. Ventilators didn't run out, as they had in parts of Italy. Hospitals had time to add extra beds. Social distancing worked. But the indiscriminate lockdown was necessary only because America's leaders wasted months of LEFT: A PRO-TRUMP PROTESTER IN HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA, IN APRIL.

Deploying this blunt policy instrument came at enor- mous cost. Unemployment rose to 14.7/uni00A0percent, the highest level since record-keeping began, in 1948. More than 26/uni00A0million peo-ple lost their jobs, a catastrophe in a country that\u2014uniquely and absurdly\u2014ties health care to employment. Some COVID-19 sur- vivors have been hit with seven-/f_igure medical bills. In the middle of the greatest health and economic crises in generations, millions of Americans have found themselves dis connected from medical care and impoverished. /T_hey join the millions who have always lived that way. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /c.sc/o.sc/r.sc/o.sc/n.sc/a.sc /v.sc/i.sc/r.sc/u.sc/s.sc /f.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/d.sc, exploited, and widened every inequity that the U.S. had to oer. Elderly people, already pushed to the fringes of society, were treated as acceptable losses. Women were more likely to lose jobs than men, and also shoul-dered extra burdens of child care and domestic work, while facing rising rates of domestic violence. In half of the states, people with dementia and intellectual disabilities faced policies that threatened to deny them access to lifesaving ventilators. /T_housands of people endured months of COVID-19 symptoms that resembled those of chronic postviral illnesses, only to be told that their devastating symptoms were in their head. Latinos were three times as likely to be infected as white people. Asian Americans faced racist abuse. Far from being a \"great equalizer,\" the pandemic fell unevenly upon the U.S., taking advantage of injustices that had been brewing throughout the nation's history. Of the 3.1 million Americans who cannot aord health insur- ance, more than half are people of color, and 30 percent are Black. /T_his is no accident. In the decades after the Civil War, the white leaders of former slave states deliberately withheld health care from Black Americans, apportioning medicine more according to the logic of Jim Crow than Hippocrates. /T_hey built hospitals away from Black communities, segregated Black patients into separate wings, and blocked Black students from medical school. In the 20th century, they helped construct America's system of private, employer-based insurance, which has kept many Black people from receiving adequate medical treatment. /T_hey fought every attempt to improve Black people's access to health care, from the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in the '60s to the passage of the Aordable Care Act in 2010. A number of former slave states also have among the low- est investments in public health, the lowest quality of medical care, the highest proportions of Black citizens, and the greatest racial divides in health outcomes. As the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, they were among the quickest to lift social-distancing restrictions and reexpose their citizens to the corona virus. /T_he harms of these moves were unduly foisted upon the poor and the Black. As of early July, one in every 1,450 Black Americans had died from COVID-19\u2014a rate more than twice that of white Americans. /T_hat /f_igure is both tragic and wholly expected given the mountain of medical disadvantages that Black people face. Compared with white people, they die three years younger. /T_hree times as many Black mothers die during pregnancy.

When they go to hospitals, they're less likely to be treated. /T_he care they do receive tends to be poorer. Aware of these biases, Black people are hesitant to seek aid for COVID-19 symptoms and then show up at hospitals in sicker states. \"One of my patients said, 'I don't want to go to the hospital, because they're not going to treat me well,' \" says Uch\u00e9 Blackstock, an emergency physician and the founder of Advanc-ing Health Equity, a nonpro/f_it that /f_ights bias and racism in health care. \"Another whispered to me, 'I'm so relieved you're Black. I just want to make sure I'm listened to.' \" Black people were both more worried about the pandemic and more likely to be infected by it. /T_he dismantling of Amer-ica's social safety net left Black people with less income and higher unemployment. /T_hey make up a disproportionate share of the low-paid \"essential workers\" who were expected to sta grocery stores and warehouses, clean buildings, and deliver mail while the pandemic raged around them. Earning hourly wages without paid sick leave, they couldn't aord to miss shifts even when symptomatic. /T_hey faced risky commutes on crowded public transportation while more privileged people teleworked from the safety of isolation. \"/T_here's nothing about Blackness that makes you more prone to COVID,\" says Nicolette Louis-saint, the executive director of Healthcare Ready, a nonpro/f_it that works to strengthen medical supply chains. Instead, existing inequities stack the odds in favor of the virus. Native Americans were similarly vulnerable. A third of the people in the Navajo Nation can't easily wash their hands, because they've been embroiled in long-running negotiations over the rights to the water on their own lands. /T_hose with water must contend with runo from uranium mines. Most live in cramped multi generational homes, far from the few hospitals that service a 17- million-acre reservation. As of mid-May, the Navajo Nation had higher rates of COVID-19 infections than any U.S. state. Americans often misperceive historical inequities as personal failures. Stephen Human, a Republican state senator and doctor in Ohio, suggested that Black Americans might be more prone to COVID-19 because they don't wash their hands enough, a remark for which he later apologized. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, also a physician, noted that Black people have higher rates of chronic disease, as if this were an answer in itself, and not a pattern that demanded further explanation. /C.sc/l.sc/e.sc/a.sc/r.sc /d.sc/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/r.sc/i.sc/b.sc/u.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc of accurate information is among the most important defenses against an epidemic's spread. And yet the largely unregulated, social-media-based communica-tions infrastructure of the 21st century almost ensures that mis-information will proliferate fast. \"In every outbreak throughout the existence of social media, from Zika to Ebola, conspiratorial communities immediately spread their content about how it's all caused by some government or pharmaceutical company or Bill Gates,\" says Ren\u00e9e DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory, who studies the /f_low of online information. When COVID-19 arrived, \"there was no doubt in my mind that it was coming.\" Sure enough, existing conspiracy theories\u2014George Soros! 5G! Bioweapons!\u2014were repurposed for the pandemic. An info-demic of falsehoods spread alongside the actual virus. Rumors coursed through online platforms that are designed to keep users engaged, even if that means feeding them content that is polarizing or untrue. In a national crisis, when people need to act in concert, this is calamitous. \"/T_he social internet as a system is broken,\" DiResta told me, and its faults are readily abused. Beginning on April 16, DiResta's team noticed growing online chatter about Judy Mikovits, a discredited researcher turned anti-vaccination champion. Posts and videos cast Mikovits as a whistle-blower who claimed that the new corona virus was made in a lab and described Anthony Fauci of the White House's corona virus task force as her nemesis. Ironically, this conspiracy theory was nested inside a larger conspiracy\u2014part of an orchestrated PR campaign by an anti-vaxxer and QAnon fan with the explicit goal to \"take down Anthony Fauci.\" It culminated in a slickly produced video called Plandemic, which was released on May/uni00A04. More than 8/uni00A0million people watched it in a week. LEFT: A WOMAN HUGS HER GRANDMOTHER THROUGH A PLASTIC SHEET IN WANTAGH, NEW YORK. RIGHT: AN ELDERLY WOMAN HAS HER OXYGEN LEVELS TESTED IN YONKERS, NEW YORK. 0920_WEL_Yong_Covid [Print]_13900462.indd COLEDoctors and journalists tried to debunk Plandemic's many misleading claims, but these eorts spread less successfully than the video itself. Like pandemics, infodemics quickly become uncontrollable unless caught early. But while health organiza-tions recognize the need to surveil for emerging diseases, they are woefully unprepared to do the same for emerging conspira-cies. In 2016, when DiResta spoke with a CDC team about the threat of misinformation, \"their response was: ' /T_hat's interest- ing, but that's just stu that happens on the internet.' \" Rather than countering misinformation during the pan- demic's early stages, trusted sources often made things worse. Many health experts and government ocials downplayed the threat of the virus in January and February, assuring the public that it posed a low risk to the U.S. and drawing comparisons to the ostensibly greater threat of the /f_lu. /T_he WHO, the CDC, and the U.S. surgeon general urged people not to wear masks, hoping to preserve the limited stocks for health-care workers. /T_hese messages were oered without nuance or acknowledge-ment of uncertainty, so when they were reversed\u2014the virus is worse than the /f_lu; wear masks\u2014the changes seemed like befuddling /f_lip-/f_lops. /T_he media added to the confusion. Drawn to novelty, jour- nalists gave oxygen to fringe anti- lockdown protests while most Americans quietly stayed home. /T_hey wrote up every incre-mental scienti/f_ic claim, even those that hadn't been veri/f_ied or peer-reviewed. /T_here were many such claims to choose from. By tying career advancement to the publishing of papers, academia already creates incentives for scientists to do attention-grabbing but ir reproducible work. /T_he pandemic strengthened those incen-tives by prompting a rush of panicked research and promising ambitious scientists global attention. In March, a small and severely /f_lawed French study sug- gested that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine could treat COVID-19. Published in a minor journal, it likely would have been ignored a decade ago. But in 2020, it wended its way to Donald T rump via a chain of credulity that included Fox News, Elon Musk, and Dr./uni00A0Oz. T rump spent months touting the drug as a miracle cure despite mounting evidence to the contrary, causing shortages for people who actually needed it to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. /T_he hydroxychloroquine story was muddied even further by two studies published in top medical journals\u2014/T_he Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine\u2014that claimed the drug was not eective and was potentially harmful. /T_he papers relied on suspect data from a small analytics company called Surgisphere. Both were retracted in June. Science famously self-corrects. But during the pandemic, the same urgent pace that has produced valuable knowledge at record speed has also sent sloppy claims around the world before anyone could even raise a skeptical eyebrow. /T_he ensuing confu-sion, and the many genuine unknowns about the virus, has cre-ated a vortex of fear and uncertainty, which grifters have sought to exploit. Snake-oil merchants have peddled ineectual silver bullets (including actual silver). Armchair experts with scant or absent quali/f_ications have found regular slots on the nightly news. And at the center of that confusion is Donald T rump. /D.sc/u.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /a.sc /p.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc/e.sc/m.sc/i.sc/c.sc, leaders must rally the public, tell the truth, and speak clearly and consistently. Instead, T rump repeat-edly contradicted public-health experts, his scienti/f_ic advisers, and himself. He said that \"nobody ever thought a thing like [the pandemic] could happen\" and also that he \"felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\" Both statements cannot be true at the same time, and in fact neither is true. A month before his inauguration, I wrote that \"the question isn't whether [T rump will] face a deadly outbreak during his presidency, but when.\" Based on his actions as a media personality during the 2014 Ebola outbreak and as a candidate in the 2016 election, I sug-gested that he would fail at diplomacy, close borders, tweet rashly, spread conspiracy theories, ignore experts, and exhibit reckless self-con/f_idence. And so he did.

He isn't solely responsible for America's /f_iasco, but he is central to it. A pandemic demands the coordinated eorts of dozens of agencies. \"In the best circumstances, it's hard to make the bureaucracy move quickly,\" Ron Klain said. \"It moves if the president stands on a table and says, 'Move quickly.' But it really doesn't move if he's sitting at his desk saying it's not a big deal.\" In the early days of T rump's presidency, many believed that America's institutions would check his excesses. /T_hey have, in part, but T rump has also corrupted them. /T_he CDC is but his latest victim. On February/uni00A025, the agency's respiratory-disease chief, Nancy Messonnier, shocked people by raising the possibility of school closures and saying that \"disruption to everyday life might be severe.\" T rump was reportedly enraged. In response, he seems to have benched the entire agency. /T_he CDC led the way in every recent domestic disease outbreak and has been the inspiration and template for public-health agencies around the world. But dur-ing the three months when some 2/uni00A0million Americans contracted COVID-19 and the death toll topped 100,000, the agency didn't hold a single press conference. Its detailed guidelines on reopen-ing the country were shelved for a month while the White House released its own uselessly vague plan. Again, everyday Americans did more than the White House. By voluntarily agreeing to months of social distancing, they bought the country time, at substantial cost to their /f_inancial and mental well-being. /T_heir sacri/f_ice came with an implicit social contract\u2014that the government would use the valuable time to mobilize an extraordinary, energetic eort to suppress the virus, as did the likes of Germany and Singapore. But the government did not, to the baement of health experts. \"/T_here are instances in history where humanity has really moved mountains to defeat infectious diseases,\" says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"It's appalling that we in the U.S. have not summoned that energy around COVID-19.\" Instead, the U.S. sleepwalked into the worst possible scenario: People suered all the debilitating eects of a lockdown with few of the bene/f_its. Most states felt compelled to reopen without accruing enough tests or contact tracers. In April and May, the nation was stuck on a terrible plateau, averaging 20,000 to 30,000 new cases every day. In June, the plateau again became an upward slope, soar-ing to record-breaking heights. T rump never rallied the country. Despite declaring himself a \"wartime president,\" he merely presided over a culture war, turning public health into yet another politicized cage match. Abetted by supporters in the conservative media, he framed measures that pro-tect against the virus, from masks to social distancing, as liberal and anti-American. Armed anti-lockdown protesters demonstrated at government buildings while T rump egged them on, urging them to \"LIBERATE\" Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia. Several public-health ocials left their jobs over harassment and threats. It is no coincidence that other powerful nations that elected populist leaders\u2014Brazil, Russia, India, and the United Kingdom\u2014 also fumbled their response to COVID-19. \"When you have people elected based on undermining trust in the government, what hap-pens when trust is what you need the most?\" says Sarah Dalglish of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who studies the political determinants of health. \"T rump is president,\" it /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/r.sc/i.sc/e.sc/s.sc /t.sc/h.sc/a.sc/t.sc fared better against COVID-19 didn't follow a universal playbook.

Each nation succeeded because it did enough things right. Meanwhile, the United States underperformed across the board, and its errors compounded. /T_he dearth of tests allowed un con/f_irmed cases to create still more cases, which /f_looded the hospitals, which ran out of masks, which are necessary to limit the virus's spread. T witter ampli/f_ied T rump's misleading messages, which raised fear and anxiety among people, which led them to spend more time scouring for information on T witter. Even sea-soned health experts underestimated these compounded risks. Yes, having T rump at the helm during a pandemic was worrying, but it was tempting to think that national wealth and technological supe-riority would save America. \"We are a rich country, and we think we can stop any infectious disease because of that,\" says Michael Oster-holm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \"But dollar bills alone are no match against a virus.\" Public-health experts talk wearily about the panic-neglect cycle, in which outbreaks trigger waves of attention and funding that quickly dissipate once the diseases recede. /T_his time around, the U.S. is already /f_lirting with neglect, before the panic phase is over. /T_he virus was never beaten in the spring, but many people, includ-ing T rump, pretended that it was. Every state reopened to varying degrees, and many subsequently saw record numbers of cases. After Arizona's cases started climbing sharply at the end of May, Cara Christ, the director of the state's health-services department, said, \"We are not going to be able to stop the spread. And so we can't stop living as well.\" /T_he virus 5:42:23 PM46 /four.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyleAt times, Americans have seemed to collectively surrender to COVID-19. /T_h e White House's corona virus task force wound down. T rump resumed holding rallies, and called for less testing, so that o cial numbers would be rosier. /T_h e country behaved like a horror-movie character who believes the danger is over, even though the monster is still at large. /T_h e long wait for a vaccine will likely culminate in a predictable way: Many Americans will refuse to get it, and among those who want it, the most vulnerable will be last in line. Still, there is some reason for hope. Many of the people I interviewed tentatively suggested that the upheaval wrought by COVID-19 might be so large as to permanently change the nation's disposition. Experience, after all, sharpens the mind. East Asian states that had lived through the SARS and MERS epidem-ics reacted quickly when threatened by SARS-CoV-2, spurred by a cultural memory of what a fast-moving corona virus can do. But the U.S. had barely been touched by the major epidemics of past decades (with the exception of the H1N1 /f_l u). In 2019, more Americans were concerned about terrorists and cyberattacks than about outbreaks of exotic diseases. Perhaps they will emerge from this pandemic with immunity both cellular and cultural. /T_h ere are also a few signs that Americans are learning impor- tant lessons. A June survey showed that 60 to 75 percent of Americans were still practicing social distancing. A partisan gap exists, but it has narrowed. \"In public-opinion polling in the U.S., high-60s agreement on anything is an amazing accomplish ment,\" says Beth Redbird, a sociologist at Northwest-ern University, who led the survey. Polls in May also showed that most Democrats and Republicans supported mask wearing, and felt it should be mandatory in at least some indoor spaces. It is almost unheard-of for a public-health measure to go from zero to majority acceptance in less than half a year. But pandemics are rare situations when \"people are desperate for guidelines and rules,\" says Zo\u00eb McLaren, a health-policy professor at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County. /T_h e closest analogy is pregnancy, she says, which is \"a time when women's lives are changing, and they can absorb a ton of information. A pandemic is similar: People are actually paying attention, and learning.\" Redbird's survey suggests that Americans indeed sought out new sources of information\u2014and that consumers of news from conservative outlets, in particular, expanded their media diet. People of all political bents became more dissatis/f_i ed with the T rump administration. As the economy nose-dived, the health-care system ailed, and the government fumbled, belief in Ameri-can exceptionalism declined. \"Times of big social disruption call into question things we thought were normal and standard,\" Redbird told me. \"If our institutions fail us here, in what ways are they failing elsewhere?\" And whom are they failing the most? Americans were in the mood for systemic change. /T_h en, on May/uni00A025, George Floyd, who had survived COVID-19's assault on his airway, asphyxiated under the crushing pressure of a police o -cer's knee. /T_h e excruciating video of his killing circulated through communities that were still reeling from the deaths of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, and disproportionate casualties from COVID-19. America's simmering outrage came to a boil and spilled into its streets. De/f_i ant and largely cloaked in masks, protesters turned out in more than 2,000 cities and towns. Support for Black Lives Matter soared: For the /f_i rst time since its founding in 2013, the movement had majority approval across racial groups. /T_h ese pro-tests were not about the pandemic, but individual protesters had been primed by months of shocking governmental missteps. Even people who might once have ignored evidence of police brutality recognized yet another broken institution. /T_h ey could no longer look away. It is hard to stare directly at the biggest problems of our age. Pandemics, climate change, the sixth extinction of wildlife, food and water shortages\u2014their scope is planetary, and their stakes are overwhelming. We have no choice, though, but to grapple with them. It is now abundantly clear what happens when global disasters collide with historical negligence. COVID-19 is an assault on America's body, and a referendum on the ideas that animate its culture. Recovery is possible, but it demands radical introspection. America would be wise to help reverse the ruination of the natural world, a process that contin-ues to shunt animal diseases into human bodies. It should strive to prevent sickness instead of pro/f_i ting from it. It should build a health-care system that prizes resilience over brittle e ciency, and an information system that favors light over heat. It should rebuild its international alliances, its social safety net, and its trust in empiricism. It should address the health inequities that /f_l ow from its history. Not least, it should elect leaders with sound judg-ment, high character, and respect for science, logic, and reason. /T_h e pandemic has been both tragedy and teacher.

It was July 30, 2019, not long past 9 a.m. Donald T rump was headed to historic Jamestown to mark the 400th anniver-sary of the /f_irst representative assembly of European settlers in the Americas. But Black Virginia legislators were boycotting the visit. Over the preceding two weeks, the president had been engaged in one of the most racist political assaults on mem-bers of Congress in American history. Like so many controversies during T rump's presidency, it had all started with an early-morning tweet. \"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Dem- ocrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning gov-ernment at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,\" T rump tweeted on Sunday, July/uni00A014, 2019. \"Why don't they go back and help /f_ix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. /T_hese places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough.\" T rump was referring to four freshman members of Congress: Ilhan Omar of Min-nesota, a Somali Massachusetts, an African American; Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, a Palestinian American; and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a Puerto Rican. Pressley screen-shotted T rump's tweet and declared, \"THIS is what racism looks like.\" On the South Lawn, T rump now faced reporters and cameras. Over the drone of the helicopter rotors, one reporter asked T rump if he was bothered that \"more and more people\" were calling him racist. \"I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world,\" T rump replied, hands up, palms facing out for emphasis. His hands came down. He singled out a vocal critic, the Reverend Al Sharpton. \"Now, he's a racist,\" T rump said. \"What I've done for African Americans, no president, I would say, has done/uni00A0... And the African American community is so thankful.\" It was an absurd statement. But in a twisted way, T rump was right. As his administration's /f_irst term comes to an end, Black Americans\u2014indeed, all Americans\u2014should in one respect be thankful to him. He has held up a mirror to American soci-ety, and it has re/f_lected back a grotesque image that many people had until now refused to see: an image not just of the racism still coursing through the country, but also of the re/f_lex to deny that reality. Though it was hardly his intention, no president has caused more Americans to stop denying the existence of racism than Donald T rump. II. /W.sc/e.sc /a.sc/r.sc/e.sc /l.sc/i.sc/v.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc in the midst of an anti- racist revolution. /T_his spring and summer, demonstrations calling for racial justice attracted hundreds of thousands of people in Los Angeles, Washington, New York, and other large cities. Smaller demonstra-tions erupted in northeastern enclaves such as Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Bar Harbor, Maine; in western towns such as Havre, Montana, and Hermiston, Oregon; in midsize cities such as Waco, Texas, and Topeka, Kansas; and in wealthy suburbs such as Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and Darien, Connecticut. Veteran activists and new recruits to the cause pushed policy makers to hold violent police ocers accountable, to ban choke holds and no-knock warrants, to shift fund-ing from law enforcement to social services, and to end the practice of sending armed and dangerous ocers to respond to inci-dents in which the suspect is neither armed nor dangerous. But these activists weren't merely advocating for a few policy shifts. /T_hey were calling for the eradication of rac-ism in America once and for all. /T_he president attempted to portray the righteous demonstrations as the work of looters and thugs, but many of the people watching at home didn't see it that way. /T_his summer, a majority of Americans\u2014 57/uni00A0percent, according to a Monmouth University poll\u2014said that police ocers were more likely to use excessive force against Black \"culprits\" than they were against white ones. That's an increase from just 33/uni00A0percent in December 2014, after a grand jury declined to indict a New York City police ocer in the killing of Eric Garner. What's more, by early June, roughly three out of four Americans were saying that \"racial and ethnic discrimination\" is a \"big problem\" in the United States\u2014up from only about half of Americans in 2015, when T rump launched his presiden-tial campaign.\"I'M THE LEAST RACIST PERSON THERE IS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,\" TRUMP SAID. 0920_WEL_Kendi_RacismTrump [Print]_13893274.indd 50 7/13/2020 12:54:49 PM50\"I'M THE \"I'M THE LEAST RACIST LEAST RACIST PERSON PERSON THERE IS THERE IS ANYWHERE IN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,\" THE WORLD,\" TRUMP SAID.TRUMP SAID. /five.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyleIt would be easy to see these shifts as the direct result of the horrifying events that have unfolded in 2020: a pandemic that has had a disproportionate eect on people of color; the video of George Floyd dying beneath the knee of an impassive Minneapolis police ocer; the ghastly kill-ing of Breonna Taylor, shot to death in her own home. Yet fundamental shifts in American views of race were already under way before the COVID-19 disparities became clear and before these latest examples of police violence surfaced. /T_he percentage of Americans who told Monmouth poll-sters that racial and ethnic discrimination is a big problem made a greater leap from January 2015 (51/uni00A0percent) to July 2016 (68/uni00A0percent) than from July 2016 to June 2020 (76/uni00A0percent). What we are witnessing right now is the culmination of a longer process\u2014a process that tracks closely with the political career of Donald T rump. III. /I.sc/n.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /d.sc/a.sc/y.sc/s.sc leading up to T rump's attack on Omar, Pressley, Tlaib, and Ocasio-Cortez, Fox News slammed the \"Squad,\" especially Omar. All four had been publicly sparring with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over a $4.6/uni00A0billion border-aid package that they thought did not suciently restrain T rump's immigration policies. Yet Pelosi promptly defended her fel- low Democrats on July 14, 2019. \"When @realDonaldT rump tells four American Congresswomen to go back to their coun-tries,\" Pelosi tweeted, \"he rearms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again.\" It has always been a racial slur for white Americans to tell Americans of color, \"Go back to your country.\" Because their country is New York City, where Ocasio-Cortez was born. Their coun-try is Detroit, Tlaib's birthplace. /T_heir country is greater Boston, where Pressley lives. /T_heir country is the United States, to which Omar's family immigrated when she was young. As Democratic politicians raged at the president that Sunday, Republicans were silent. \"It's become frighteningly common for many of my Republican colleagues to let these moments sail by without saying even a word,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Sen-ate /f_loor. To be fair, by Monday, a few Repub- licans, including Representatives Mike/uni00A0 T urner of Ohio and Will Hurd of Texas, had called the presi-dent's tweets racist. But T rump, emboldened by the silence from the rest of his caucus, doubled down on his attacks. \"IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY HERE,\" T rump wrote to the four women on T witter, \"YOU CAN LEAVE.\" The president added: \"If Democrats want to unite around the foul language & racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular & un representative Congress-women, it will be interesting to see how it plays out.\" By Monday night, House Democrats had had enough. /T_hey introduced a resolution to \"strongly\" condemn the president's racist tweets. T rump woke up the next morning once again in a state of angry denial. \"/T_hose T weets were NOT Racist,\" he tweeted. \"I don't have a bone in body!\" /F.sc/o.sc/r.sc /b.sc/e.sc/t.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc /o.sc/r.sc /w.sc/o.sc/r.sc/s.sc/e.sc, Americans see themselves\u2014and their country\u2014in the president. From the days of George Washington, the president has personi-/f_ied the American body. /T_he motto of the United States is E pluribus unum \u2014\"Out of many, one.\" /T_he \"one\" is the president. To T rump, and to many of his sup- porters, the American body must be a white body. When he launched his presi-dential campaign, on June 16, 2015, he began with attacks on immigrants of color and on the person whose citizen-ship he'd falsely questioned as a peddler of birtherism: Barack Obama. /T_hey were all desecrating the American body. Of Mexican immigrants, he said: \"/T_hey're bringing drugs. /T_hey're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" Of Obama, he said: \"He's been a negative force. We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.\" ILLUSTRATIONS BY JON KEYGAGE SKIDMORE; SECRETNAME101; SENATE /five.taboldstyle/two.taboldstyleT rump presented himself as that somebody. To make America great again, he would make it seem as if a Black man had never been president, erasing him from history by repealing and replacing his signature accomplishments, from the Aordable Care Act to DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. He would also build a wall to keep out immigrants, and he would ban Mus-lims from entering the country. Days after /f_irst proposing his Muslim ban, in December 2015\u2014 still early in his candidacy\u2014 T rump told CNN's Don Lemon, \"I am the least racist person that you have ever met.\" T rump's denial was audacious, but back then, his audacity only contributed to the complacent sense among many Americans that this interloper from reali ty television posed no serious threat. Yet the Americans who dismissed T rump's chances were living in denial themselves. For many, Obama's presidency was proof that the country was rising to its ideals of liberty and equality. When a Black man climbed to the highest oce in the land, it signi/f_ied that the nation was postracial, or at least that history was inexorably bending in that direction. /T_he Obama administration itself boasted that it was /f_ighting the remnants of racism\u2014a mop-up operation in a war that was all but won. I was less sanguine. In the months leading up to the 2016 election, I told family and friends that T rump had a good chance of winning. Across American his-tory, racial progress has normally been followed by its opposite. So I was glad to be alone on Elec- tion Night. I did not want to see people I loved shocked that a racist nation had elected a racist president. On Novem-ber/uni00A08, 2016, I watched the returns come in by myself, on the couch. My daugh-ter, Imani, was sleeping in her crib. My wife, Sadiqa, was at the hospital, treating patients during an overnight shift in the pediatric emergency department. I stayed up until 1:35 a.m. When T rump carried Pennsylvania, I turned o the television and called Sadiqa to hear how her shift was going. Our conversa-tion was brief; she had to get back to her patients. Later, I would read about how, around 2:50 a.m., T rump greeted his exuberant supporters in New York City with a victory speech. He pledged to be \"a president for all Americans.\" V. /W.sc/i.sc/t.sc/h.sc/i.sc/n.sc /d.sc/a.sc/y.sc/s.sc of being sworn in, T rump broke that promise. He reversed holds on two oil-pipeline projects, including one through the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, which was opposed by more than 200 Indigenous nations. He issued executive orders call-ing for the construction of a wall along the southern border and the deportation of individuals who \"pose a risk to public safety or national security.\" He enacted his /f_irst of three Muslim bans. By the end of the spring, Attorney General Je Sessions had directed fed-eral prosecutors to seek the harshest prison sentences whenever possible. Ses-sions had also laid the groundwork for the suspension of all the consent decrees that provided federal oversight of law- enforcement agencies that had demon-strated a pattern of racism. Led by Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, the administration worked on ways to restrict immigration by people of color. /T_here was a sense of urgency, because, as T rump said at a private White House meeting in June/uni00A02017, Haitians \"all have AIDS\" and Nigerians would never \"go back to their huts\" once they came to the United States. Then came Charlottesville. On August/uni00A011, 2017, about 250 white supremacists marched on the Univer-sity of Virginia campus, carrying torches that lit up the night sky with racism and anti-Semitism. Demonstrating against Charlottes ville's plan to remove statues honoring Confederates, they chanted, \"Blood and soil!\" They chanted, \"Jews lives matter!\" /T_he white supremacists clashed with anti-racist demonstrators that night and the next afternoon.

He spoke about there being \"very /f_ine people\" on \"both sides.\" On September 5, 2017, T rump began his long and un successful attempt to elim-inate DACA, which deferred deporta-tions for roughly 800,000 un documented immigrants who had arrived in the U.S. as children. /T_he T rump administration also began rescinding the Temporary Protected Status of thousands of refugees from wars and natural disasters years ago in Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti, El Salvador, Nepal, and Honduras. Near the end of his /f_irst year in oce, T rump wondered aloud at a White House meeting: \"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\" He was referring to Haiti, El Salva-dor, and nations in Africa. He suggested that the U.S. should bring in more people from countries like Norway. /T_hree days later, on January 14, 2018, speaking before reporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, he was again asked if he was racist. \"No, I'm not a racist,\" he responded. \"I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed.\" VI. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /A.sc/m.sc/e.sc/r.sc/i.sc/c.sc/a.sc /t.sc/h.sc/a.sc/t.sc denied its racism through the Obama years has struggled to deny its racism through the T rump years. From 1977 to 2018, the Gen-eral Social Survey asked whether Black Americans \"have worse jobs, income, and housing than white people/uni00A0... mainly due to discrimination.\" /T_here are only two answers to this question. /T_he racist answer is \"no\"\u2014it presumes that racist discrimination no longer exists and that racial inequities are the result of some-thing being wrong with Black people. /T_he anti-racist answer is \"yes\"\u2014it pre-sumes that nothing is wrong or right, inferior or superior, about any racial group, so the explanation for racial dis-parities must be discrimination. In 2008, as Obama was headed for the White House, only 34.5/uni00A0percent of respondents answered \"yes,\" a num-ber I'll call the anti-racist rate. /T_his was the second-lowest anti-racist rate of the 41-year polling period. /T_he rate rose to 37.7/uni00A0percent in 2010, perhaps because the emergence of the Tea Party forced a reckoning for some white Americans, but it fell back down to 34.9/uni00A0percent in 2012 and 34.6/uni00A0percent in 2014. In 2016, as T rump loomed over Amer- ican politics, the anti-racist rate rose to 42.6/uni00A0percent. It went up to 46.2/uni00A0percent in 2018, a double-digit increase from the start of the Obama administration. In large part, shifts in white public opinion explain the jump. /T_he white anti-racist rate was barely 29.8/uni00A0percent in 2008. It jumped to 37.7/uni00A0percent in 2016 and to 40.5/uni00A0percent two years into T rump's presidency. The deniers of racism, those who blame people of color for racial inequity and injustice, have mostly been white, but not exclusively so. Between 1977 and 2018, the lowest anti-racist rate among Black respondents\u201447.2 percent\u2014came in 2012, the midpoint of Obama's presi-dency. /T_hat rate climbed to 61.1/uni00A0percent in 2016 and 66/uni00A0percent in 2018, a nearly 20-point swing from the Obama years. It has become harder, in the T rump years, to blame Black people for racial inequity and injustice. It has also become harder to tell Black people that the fault lies with them, and to urge them to improve their station by behaving in an upstanding or respectable manner. In the T rump years, the problem is obvious, and it isn't Black people's behavior. VII. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /U.sc/n.sc/i.sc/t.sc/e.sc/d.sc /S.sc/t.sc/a.sc/t.sc/e.sc/s.sc has often been called a land of contradictions, and to be sure, its failings sit alongside some nota-ble achievements\u2014a New Deal for many Americans in the 1930s, the defeat of fas-cism abroad in the 1940s. But on racial matters, the U.S. could just as accurately be described as a land in denial. It has been a massacring nation that said it cherished life, a slaveholding nation that claimed it valued liberty, a hierarchal nation that declared it valued equality, a disenfranchis-ing nation that branded itself a democracy, a segregated nation that styled itself sepa-rate but equal, an excluding nation that boasted of opportunity for all. A nation is what it does, not what it originally claimed it would be. Often, a nation is precisely what it denies itself to be. /T_here was a grand moment, however, when a large swath of Americans walked away from a history of racial denial. In the 1850s, slaveholders expanded their reach into the North. /T_heir slave-catchers, backed by federal power, were super seding state and local law to cap-ture runaways (and free Blacks) who had escaped across the Mason-Dixon Line. Formerly enslaved people such as Fred-erick Douglass and Sojourner T ruth, as well as journalists such as William Lloyd Garrison, stood in pulpits across the North and West describing the brutality and in humanity of slavery. Meanwhile, slaveholders fought to expand their power out west\u2014where white people who did not want to compete with enslaved Black labor were calling for free soil. Begin-ning in 1854, slaveholders went to war with free-soilers (and abolitionists like John Brown) in Kansas over whether the state\u2014and the United States\u2014would be free or slave. /T_he Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, in 1857, implied that Black people and northern states \"had no rights\" that slaveholders were \"bound to respect.\" Slaveholders seemed intent on spread- ing their plantations from sea to shining sea. As a result, more and more white Americans became antislavery, whether out of concern for the enslaved or fear of the encroaching slave power. Black Americans, meanwhile, /f_led the country for Canada and Liberia\u2014or stayed and pressed the cause of radical abolitionism. A critical mass of Americans rejected the South's claim that enslavement was good and came to recognize the peculiar institu-tion as altogether bad. /T_he slaveholders' attempts to perpetu- ate their system back/f_ired; in the years before the Civil War, the inhumanity and cruelty of enslavement became too bla-tant for northerners to ignore or deny. Similarly, T rump's racism\u2014and that of his allies and [Print]_13893274.indd 54 7/13/2020 12:54:52 PM54 /five.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyleblatant for Americans to ignore or deny.

Republicans sounded o in protest. Pelosi turned to them, voice rising, and added: \"To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of oce to protect the American people.\" Republicans claimed that Pelosi had violated a House rule by characterizing an action as \"racist.\" /T_hey moved to have the word struck from the congressional record. /T_he motion to strike racist from the record failed along party lines. \"I know racism when I see it, I know racism when I feel it, and at the highest level of govern-ment, there's no room for racism,\" Repre-sentative John Lewis, the civil-rights icon, said during the debate. One after another, Republicans rose to defend their president. \"What has really happened here is that the president and his supporters have been forced to endure months of allegations of racism,\" said Rep-resentative Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania. \"/T_his ridiculous slander does a disservice to our nation.\" In the end, only four Republicans and the House's lone independent voted with all the Democrats to condemn the presi-dent of the United States. /T_hat means 187 House Republicans, or 98/uni00A0percent of the caucus, denied that telling four congress-women of color to go back to their coun-tries was racist. /T_hey believed, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, that \"the president's not a racist.\" To call out the president's racism would have been to call out their own racism. McConnell had been quietly killing anti-racist bills that had come out of the House since January 2019, starting with the new House's /f_irst bill, which aimed to protect Americans against voter suppression. /T_he day after being rebuked by House Democrats, T rump held the first rally of his reelection campaign. He spent a large portion of his speech in Greenville, North Carolina, railing against the four congresswomen. As he was pummeling Omar with a round of attacks, the crowd started chanting, \"Send her back! Send her back! Send her back!\" T rump stopped speaking. He made no eort to stop the chant as it grew louder. He basked in the racial slur for 13 seconds. \"Send her back! Send her back! Send her back!\" On /T_hursday, Republicans were quick to denounce the chant. \"/T_here's no place for that kind of talk,\" Tom Emmer of Minne-sota said to reporters. But, he added, \"there's not a racist bone in the president's body.\" T rump disavowed the \"Send her back\" chant, but by Friday he had disavowed his disavowal, calling the chanters \"incredible patriots\" and denying their racism along with his own. Many Americans saw through these patently false claims, how-ever. By the end of July, for the /f_irst time, a majority of voters said the president of the United States was, in fact, a racist.

But I learned to under-stand it in a personal way during the /f_irst year of T rump's presidency. In 2017, I fell ill; I felt as sick as I'd ever been. But I told myself the hourly trips to the bathroom were nothing. /T_he blood wasn't serious. I ignored the symptoms for months. I waited until the pain was unbearable before I admitted that I had a problem. And even then, I wasn't able to acknowledge it on my own. My partner saved my life. Sadiqa saw the totality of my symp- toms during a weeklong vacation over New Year's. It was the /f_irst time in months that we were together all day, every day. As soon as we returned home, in Janu-ary/uni00A02018, she dragged me to the doctor. I acquiesced to the appointment, but I still wouldn't permit the thought that my condition was serious. I did not have any of the commonly known risk factors for the worst possibility\u2014colon cancer. I was 35, and I exercised regularly, didn't smoke, rarely drank, and had no family history. I was a vegan, for goodness' sake.TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR A REVOLUTION AGAINST RACISM. 0920_WEL_Kendi_RacismTrump [Print]_13893274.indd 55 7/13/2020 12:54:52 PM /five.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyleTRUMP'S TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY PRESIDENCY HAS PAVED HAS PAVED THE WAY THE WAY FOR A FOR A REVOLUTION REVOLUTION AGAINST AGAINST RACISM.RACISM.SEPTEMBER 2020 /five.taboldstyle/six.taboldstyleI realize now that I was engaged in a powerful bout of denial. Americans, too, can easily summon a litany of reasons their country is not racist: Look at the enlight-ened principles upon which the nation was founded. Look at the progress the country has made. Look at the election of Barack Obama. Look at the dark faces in high places. Look at the diversity of the 2020 Democratic /f_ield. Even after the doctor found the tumor, my denial persisted. Once I accepted that I had cancer, I was convinced that it had to be Stage/uni00A01, for all the reasons I had been convinced that I did not have cancer at all. A routine surgery was in order, and then all would be good. I fear that this is how many Ameri- cans are thinking right now: Routine surgery\u2014the defeat of Donald T rump at the polls\u2014will heal the American body. No need to look deeper, at police departments, at schools, at housing. Are Americans now acknowledging racism, but telling themselves the problem is contained? Are they telling themselves that it is a big problem, but it can't have spread to almost every part of the body politic? Will this become the new form of American denial? False hope was my new normal, until it wasn't. When they scanned my body, doctors found that the cancer had spread. I had Stage/uni00A04 colon cancer. I had two choices: denial and death, or recognition and life. America now has two choices.

He will continue to claim that he loves people of color, the very people his policies harm. He will con-tinue to call himself \"not racist,\" and turn the descriptive term racist back on anyone who has the temerity to call out his own prejudice. T rump clearly hopes that racist ideas\u2014paired with policies designed to suppress the vote\u2014will lead to his reelection. But now that T rump has pushed a critical mass of Americans to a point where they can no longer explain away the nation's sins, the question is what those Americans will do about it. One path forward leads to a mere res- toration. Barack Obama's vice president unseats T rump, removing the bad apple from the barrel. With T rump dispatched, the nation believes it is again headed in the right direction. On this path, Americans consider racism to be a signi/f_icant prob-lem. But they deny the true gravity of the problem and the need for drastic action. On this path, monuments to racism are dismantled, but Americans shrink from the awesome task of reshaping the coun-try with anti-racist policies. With T rump gone, Americans decide they don't need to be actively anti-racist anymore. Or Americans can realize that they are at a point of no return. No returning to the bad old habit of denial. No returning to cynicism. No returning to normal\u2014the normal in which racist policies, defended by racist ideas, lead to racial inequities. On this path, T rump's denialism has permanently changed the way Americans view themselves. /T_he T rump eect is real, and lasting. /T_he reckoning we have wit-nessed this spring and summer at public demonstrations transforms into a reckon-ing in legislatures, C-suites, university-admissions oces. On this path, the American people demand equitable results, not speeches that make them feel good about them-selves and their country. /T_he American people give policy makers an ultima-tum: Use your power to radically reduce in equity and injustice, or be voted out. The abolition of slavery seemed as impossible in the 1850s as equality seems today. But just as the abolitionists of the 1850s demanded the immediate eradica-tion of slavery, immediate equality must be the demand today. Abolish police vio-lence. Abolish mass incarceration. Abol-ish the racial wealth gap and the gap in school funding. Abolish barriers to citizen-ship. Abolish voter suppression. Abolish health disparities. Not in 20 years. Not in 10 years. Now. Ibram X.

Near its center is the Institute of Automation, a sleek silvery-blue building surrounded by camera-studded poles. /T_h e institute is a basic research facility. Its com-puter scientists inquire into arti/f_i cial intel-ligence's fundamental mysteries. /T_h eir more practical innovations\u2014iris recognition, cloud-based speech synthesis\u2014are spun o to Chinese tech giants, AI start-ups, and, in some cases, the People's Liberation Army. I visited the institute on a rainy morn- ing in the summer of 2019. China's best and brightest were still shu ing in post-commute, dressed casually in basketball shorts or yoga pants, AirPods nestled in their ears. In my pocket, I had a burner phone; in my backpack, a computer wiped free of data\u2014standard precautions for Western journalists in China. To visit China on sensitive business is to risk being barraged with cyberattacks and malware. In 2019, Belgian o cials on a trade mis-sion noticed that their mobile data were being intercepted by pop-up antennae outside their Beijing hotel. After clearing the institute's security, I was told to wait in a lobby monitored by cameras. On its walls were posters of China's most consequential postwar leaders. Mao Zedong loomed large in his characteris-tic four-pocket suit. He looked serene, as though satis/f_i ed with having freed China from the Western yoke. Next to him was a fuzzy black-and-white shot of Deng Xiao-ping visiting the institute in his later years, after his economic reforms had set China on a course to reclaim its traditional global role as a great power. The lobby's most prominent poster depicted Xi Jinping in a crisp black suit. China's current president and the general secretary of its Communist Party has taken a keen interest in the institute. Its work is part of a grand AI strategy that Xi has laid out in a series of speeches akin to those John F ./uni00A0Kennedy used to train America's techno-scienti/f_i c sights on the moon. Xi has said that he wants China, by year's end, to be competitive with the world's AI lead-ers, a benchmark the country has arguably already reached. And he wants China to achieve AI supremacy by 2030. Xi's pronouncements on AI have a sin- ister edge. Arti/f_i cial intelligence has appli-cations in nearly every human domain, from the instant translation of spoken lan-guage to early viral-outbreak detection. But Xi also wants to use AI's awesome ana-lytical powers to push China to the cutting edge of surveillance. He wants to build an all-seeing digital system of social control, patrolled by precog algorithms that iden-tify potential dissenters in real time. China's government has a history of using major historical events to introduce and embed surveillance measures. In the run-up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Chinese security services achieved a new level of control over the country's internet. During China's coronavirus outbreak, Xi's government leaned hard on private compa-nies in possession of sensitive personal data. Any emergency data-sharing arrangements made behind closed doors during the pan-demic could become permanent. China already has hundreds of mil- lions of surveillance cameras in place. Xi's government hopes to soon achieve full video coverage of key public areas. Much of the footage collected by China's cam-eras is parsed by algorithms for security threats of one kind or another. In the near future, every person who enters a public space could be identified, instantly, by AI matching them to an ocean of per-sonal data, including their every text communication, and their body's one-of-a-kind protein-construction schema. In time, algorithms will be able to string together data points from a broad range of sources\u2014travel records, friends and asso-ciates, reading habits, purchases\u2014to pre-dict political resistance before it happens. China's government could soon achieve an unprecedented political stranglehold on more than 1/uni00A0billion people. Early in the coronavirus outbreak, Chi- na's citizens were subjected to a form of risk scoring. An algorithm assigned people a color code\u2014green, yellow, or red\u2014that determined their ability to take transit or enter buildings in China's megacities. In a sophisticated digital system of social con-trol, codes like these could be used to score a person's perceived political pliancy as well. A crude version of such a system is already in operation in China's north-western territory of Xinjiang, where more than 1/uni00A0million Muslim Uighurs have been imprisoned, the largest internment of an ethnic-religious minority since the fall of the /T_h ird Reich. Once Xi perfects this sys-tem in Xinjiang, no technological limita-tions will prevent him from extending AI surveillance across China. He could also export it beyond the country's borders, entrenching the power of a whole gen-eration of autocrats. China has recently embarked on a num- ber of ambitious infrastructure projects NORTHWEST OF rail networks, not to mention the country's much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative. But these won't reshape history like China's digital infrastructure, which could shift the balance of power between the individual and the state worldwide. American policy makers from across the political spectrum are concerned about this scenario. Michael Kratsios, the former Peter /T_h iel acolyte whom Donald T rump picked to be the U.S. government's chief technology o cer, told me that techno-logical leadership from democratic nations has \"never been more imperative\" and that \"if we want to make sure that Western val-ues are baked into the technologies of the future, we need to make sure we're leading in those technologies.\" Despite China's considerable strides, industry analysts expect America to retain its current AI lead for another decade at least. But this is cold comfort: China is already developing powerful new surveil-lance tools, and exporting them to dozens of the world's actual and would-be autoc-racies. Over the next few years, those tech-nologies will be re/f_i ned and integrated into all-encompassing surveillance systems that dictators can plug and play. The emergence of an AI-powered authoritarian bloc led by China could warp the geopolitics of this century. It could pre-vent billions of people, across large swaths of the globe, from ever securing any mea-sure of political freedom. And whatever the pretensions of American policy makers, only China's citizens can stop it. I'd come to Bei-jing to look for some sign that they might. THIS TECHNO- POLITICAL MOMENT has been long in the making. China has spent all but a few centuries of its 5,000-year history at the vanguard of infor-mation technology. Along with Sumer and Mesoamerica, it was one of three places where writing was independently invented, allowing information to be stored outside the human brain. In the second century/uni00A0/a.sc./d.sc., the Chinese invented paper. /T_h is cheap, bindable information- storage technology allowed data\u2014Silk Road trade records, military communi-qu\u00e9s, correspondence among elites\u2014to crisscross the empire on horses bred for speed by steppe nomads beyond the Great Wall. Data began to circulate even faster a few centuries later, when Tang-dynasty artisans perfected woodblock printing, a mass- information technology that helped administer a huge and growing state. As rulers of some of the world's largest complex social organizations, ancient Chi-nese emperors well understood the relation-ship between information /f_l ows and power, and the value of surveillance. During the 11th century, a Song-dynasty emperor real-ized that China's elegant walled cities had become too numerous to be monitored from Beijing, so he deputized locals to police them. A few decades before the digi-tal era's dawn, Chiang Kai-shek made use of this self-policing tradition, asking citizens to watch for dissidents in their midst, so that communist rebellions could be stamped out in their infancy. When Mao took over, he arranged cities into grids, making each square its own work unit, where local spies kept \"sharp eyes\" out for counterrevolution-ary behavior, no matter how trivial. During the initial coronavirus outbreak, Chinese social-media apps promoted hotlines where people could report those suspected of hid-ing symptoms. Xi has appropriated the phrase sharp eyes, with all its historical resonances, as his cho-sen name for the AI-powered surveillance cameras that will soon span China. With AI, Xi can build history's most oppressive authoritarian apparatus, without the man-power Mao needed to keep information about dissent /f_l owing to a single, central-ized node. In commercial partners. And in Xinjiang's Muslim minority, he has found his test population. The Chinese Communist Party has long been suspicious of religion, and not just as a result of Marxist in/f_l uence. Only a century and a half ago\u2014yesterday, in the memory of a 5,000-year-old civilization\u2014 Hong Xiuquan, a quasi-Christian mys-tic converted by Western missionaries, launched the Tai ping Rebellion, an apoc-alyptic 14-year campaign that may have killed more people than the First World War. Today, in China's single-party politi-cal system, religion is an alternative source of ultimate authority, which means it must be co-opted or destroyed. By 2009, China's Uighurs had become weary after decades of discrimination and land con/f_i scation. /T_h ey launched mass pro-tests and a smattering of suicide attacks against Chinese police. In 2014, Xi cracked down, directing Xinjiang's provincial gov-ernment to destroy mosques and reduce Uighur neighborhoods to rubble. More than 1/uni00A0million Uighurs were disappeared into concentration camps. Many were tor-tured and made to perform slave labor. Uighurs who were spared the camps now make up the most intensely surveilled population on Earth. Not all of the sur-veillance is digital. /T_h e Chinese govern-ment has moved thousands of Han Chi-nese \"big brothers and sisters\" into homes XI WANTS TO USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO BUILD A DIGITAL SYSTEM OF SOCIAL CONTROL, PATROLLED BY PRECOG ALGORITHMS THAT IDENTIFY DISSENTERS IN REAL TIME. n population vSOCIAL ALGORITHMS REAL TIME. 0920_WEL_Anderson_China [Print]_13880782.indd 61 7/13/2020 5:57:54 PM /six.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyleXI WANTS TO USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE XI WANTS TO USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO BUILD A DIGITAL SYSTEM OF SOCIAL TO BUILD A DIGITAL SYSTEM OF SOCIAL SOCIAL TO BUILD A DIGITAL SYSTEM OF SOCIAL SOCIAL TO BUILD A DIGITAL SYSTEM OF SOCIAL SOCIAL CONTROL, PATROLLED BY PRECOG ALGORITHMS ALGORITHMS CONTROL, PATROLLED BY PRECOG ALGORITHMS THAT IDENTIFY DISSENTERS IN REAL TIME.

They eat meals with the family, and some \"big brothers\" sleep in the same bed as the wives of detained Uighur men. Meanwhile, AI-powered sensors lurk everywhere, including in Uighurs' purses and pants pockets. According to the anthropologist Darren Byler, some Uighurs buried their mobile phones con-taining Islamic materials, or even froze their data cards into dumplings for safe-keeping, when Xi's campaign of cultural erasure reached full tilt. But police have since forced them to install nanny apps on their new phones. /T_he apps use algorithms to hunt for \"ideological viruses\" day and night. /T_hey can scan chat logs for Quran verses, and look for Arabic script in memes and other image /f_iles. Uighurs can't use the usual work- arounds. Installing a VPN would likely invite an investigation, so they can't down-load WhatsApp or any other prohibited encrypted-chat software. Purchasing prayer rugs online, storing digital copies of Mus-lim books, and downloading sermons from a favorite imam are all risky activities. If a Uighur were to use WeChat's payment system to make a donation to a mosque, authorities might take note. /T_he nanny apps work in tandem with the police, who spot-check phones at check-points, scrolling through recent calls and texts. Even an innocent digital association\u2014 being in a group text with a recent mosque attendee, for instance\u2014could result in detention. Staying off social media alto-gether is no solution, because digital inactiv-ity itself can raise suspicions. /T_he police are required to note when Uighurs deviate from any of their normal behavior patterns. /T_heir database wants to know if Uighurs start leaving their home through the back door instead of the front. It wants to know if they spend less time talking to neighbors than they used to. Electricity use is monitored by an algorithm for unusual use, which could indicate an unregistered resident. Uighurs can travel only a few blocks before encountering a checkpoint out/f_itted with one of Xinjiang's hundreds of thou-sands of surveillance cameras. Footage from the cameras is processed by algorithms that match faces with snapshots taken by police at \"health checks.\" At these checks, police extract all the data they can from Uighurs' bodies. /T_hey measure height and take a blood sample. /T_hey record voices and swab DNA. Some Uighurs have even been forced to participate in experiments that mine genetic data, to see how DNA produces distinctly Uighurlike chins and ears. Police will likely use the pandemic as a pretext to take still more data from Uighur bodies. Uighur women are also made to endure pregnancy checks. Some are forced to have abortions, or get an IUD inserted. Oth-ers are sterilized by the state. Police are known to rip unauthorized children away from their parents, who are then detained. Such measures have reduced the birth-rate/uni00A0in some regions of Xinjiang more than 60/uni00A0percent in three years. When Uighurs reach the edge of their neighborhood, an automated system takes note. /T_he same system tracks them as they move through smaller checkpoints, at banks, parks, and schools. When they pump gas, the system can determine whether they are the car's owner. At the city's perimeter, they're forced to exit their cars, so their face and ID card can be scanned again. The lucky Uighurs who are able to travel abroad\u2014many have had their pass-ports con/f_iscated\u2014are advised to return quickly. If they do not, police interrogators are dispatched to the doorsteps of their rel-atives and friends. Not that going abroad is any kind of escape: In a chilling glimpse at how a future authoritarian bloc might function, Xi's strongman allies\u2014even those in Muslim- majority countries such as Egypt\u2014have been more than happy to arrest and deport Uighurs back to the open-air prison that is Xinjiang. XI SEEMS TO HAVE USED Xinjiang as a laboratory to /f_ine-tune the sensory and analytical powers of his new digital panop-ticon before expanding its reach across the mainland. CETC, the state-owned com-pany that built much of Xinjiang's surveil-lance system, now boasts of pilot projects in Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Shenzhen. /T_hese are meant to lay \"a robust founda-tion for a nationwide rollout,\" according to the company, and they represent only one piece of China's coalescing mega-network of human-monitoring technology. China is an ideal setting for an experi- ment in total surveillance. Its population is extremely online. /T_he country is home to more than 1/uni00A0billion mobile phones, all chock-full of sophisticated sensors. Each one logs search-engine queries, websites visited, and mobile payments, which are ubiqui-tous. When I used a chip-based credit card to buy coee in Beijing's hip Sanlitun neighbor-hood, people glared as if I'd written a check. All of these data points can be time- stamped and geo-tagged. And because a new regulation requires telecom /f_irms to scan the face of anyone who signs up for cellphone services, phones' data can now be attached to a specific person's face. SenseTime, which helped build Xinjiang's surveillance state, recently bragged that its software can identify people wearing masks. Another company, Hanwang, claims that its facial-recognition technology can recog-nize mask wearers 95/uni00A0percent of the time. China's personal-data harvest even reaps from citizens who lack phones. Out in the countryside, villagers line up to have their faces scanned, from multiple angles, by pri-vate /f_irms in exchange for cookware. Until recently, it was dicult to imag- ine how China could integrate all of these data into a single surveillance system, but no longer. In 2018, a cybersecurity activist hacked into a facial-recognition system that appeared to be connected to the government and was synthesizing a surprising combina-tion of data streams. /T_he system was capable of detecting Uighurs by their ethnic features, and it could tell whether people's eyes or mouth were open, whether they were smil-ing, whether they had a beard, and whether they were wearing sunglasses. It logged the date, time, and serial numbers\u2014all trace-able to individual users\u2014of Wi-Fi-enabled phones that passed within its reach. It was hosted by Alibaba and made reference to City Brain, an AI-powered software plat-form that China's government has tasked the company with building. City Brain is, as the name suggests, a kind of automated nerve center, capable of synthesizing data streams from a multi-tude of sensors distributed throughout an urban environment. Many of its proposed uses are benign technocratic functions. Its 0920_WEL_Anderson_China [Print]_13880782.indd 62 7/13/2020 5:57:54 PM62 /six.taboldstyle/three.taboldstylealgorithms could, for instance, peo- ple and cars, to help with red-light tim-ing and subway-line planning. Data from sensor-laden trash cans could make waste pickup more timely and ecient. But City Brain and its successor tech- nologies will also enable new forms of integrated surveillance. Some of these will enjoy broad public support: City Brain could be trained to spot lost children, or luggage abandoned by tourists or terrorists. It could /f_lag loiterers, or homeless people, or rioters. Anyone in any kind of danger could summon help by waving a hand in a distinctive way that would be instantly rec-ognized by ever-vigilant computer vision. Earpiece-wearing police ocers could be directed to the scene by an AI voice assistant. City Brain would be espe- cially useful in a pandemic. (One of Alibaba's sister com-panies created the app that color-coded citizens' disease risk, while silently sending their health and travel data to police.) As Beijing's outbreak spread, some malls and restaurants in the city began scanning poten-tial customers' phones, pulling data from mobile carriers to see whether they'd recently traveled. Mobile carriers also sent munic-ipal governments lists of people who had come to their city from Wuhan, where the corona virus was /f_irst detected. And Chinese AI companies began making networked facial-recognition helmets for police, with built-in infrared fever detectors, capable of sending data to the government. City Brain could automate these processes, or integrate its data streams. Even China's most complex AI systems are still brittle. City Brain hasn't yet fully integrated its range of surveillance capa-bilities, and its ancestor systems have suered some embarrass-ing performance issues: In 2018, one of the government's AI- powered cameras mistook a face on the side of a city bus for a jaywalker. But the software is getting better, and there's no technical reason it can't be implemented on a mass scale. /T_he data streams that could be fed into a City Brain-like system are essentially unlim-ited. In addition to footage from the 1.9/uni00A0million facial-recognition cameras that the Chinese telecom firm China Tower is installing in cooperation with SenseTime, City Brain could absorb feeds from cameras fastened to lampposts and hanging above street corners. It could make use of the cameras that Chinese police hide in trac cones, and those strapped to 0920_WEL_Anderson_China [Print]_13880782.indd 63 7/13/2020 5:57:55 PM /six.taboldstyle/three.taboldstyleSEPTEMBER 2020 /six.taboldstyle/four.taboldstyleo cers, both uniformed and plainclothes. /T_h e state could force retailers to provide data from in-store cameras, which can now detect the direction of your gaze across a shelf, and which could soon see around corners by reading shadows. Precious little public space would be unwatched. America's police departments have begun to avail themselves of footage from Amazon's home-security cameras. In their more innocent applications, these cameras adorn doorbells, but many are also aimed at neighbors' houses. China's government could harvest footage from equivalent Chinese products. They could tap the cameras attached to ride-share cars, or the self-driving vehicles that may soon replace them: Automated vehicles will be covered in a whole host of sensors, including some that will take in information much richer than 2-D video. Data from a massive /f_l eet of them could be stitched together, and supplemented by other City Brain streams, to produce a 3-D model of the city that's updated second by second. Each refresh could log every human's location within the model. Such a system would make uniden-ti/f_i ed faces a priority, perhaps by sending drone swarms to secure a positive ID. /T_h e model's data could be time-synced to audio from any networked device with a microphone, including smart speakers, smartwatches, and less obvious Internet of /T_h ings devices like smart mattresses, smart diapers, and smart sex toys. All of these sources could coalesce into a multitrack, location-speci/f_i c audio mix that could be parsed by polyglot algorithms capable of interpreting words spoken in thousands of tongues. /T_h is mix would be useful to security services, especially in places with-out cameras: China's iFlytek is perfecting a technology that can recognize individuals by their \"voiceprint.\" In the decades to come, City Brain or its successor systems may even be able to read unspoken thoughts. Drones can already be controlled by helmets that sense and transmit neural signals, and research-ers are now designing brain-computer interfaces that go well beyond autofill, to allow you to type just by thinking. An authoritarian state with enough process-ing power could force the makers of such software to feed every blip of a citizen's neural activity into a government database. China has recently been pushing citizens to download and use a propaganda app. The government could use emotion-tracking software to monitor reactions to a political stimulus within an app. A silent, suppressed response to a meme or a clip from a Xi speech would be a meaningful data point to a precog algorithm. All of these time-synced feeds of on- the-ground data could be supplemented by footage from drones, whose gigapixel cameras can record whole cityscapes in the kind of crystalline detail that allows for license-plate reading and gait recog-nition. \"Spy bird\" drones already swoop and circle above Chinese cities, disguised as doves. City Brain's feeds could be syn-thesized with data from systems in other urban areas, to form a multidimensional, real-time account of nearly all human activity within China. Server farms across China will soon be able to hold multiple angles of high-de/f_i nition footage of every moment of every Chinese person's life. It's important to stress that systems of this scope are still in development. Most of China's personal data are not yet integrated together, even within individual compa-nies. Nor does China's government have a one-stop data repository, in part because of turf wars between agencies. But there are no hard political barriers to the integration of all these data, especially for the security state's use. To the contrary, private /f_i rms are required, by formal statute, to assist China's intelligence services. The government might soon have a rich, auto- populating data pro/f_i le for all of its 1/uni00A0billion-plus citizens. Each pro/f_i le would comprise millions of data points, including the person's every appearance in surveilled space, as well as all of her com-munications and purchases. Her threat risk to the party's power could constantly be updated in real time, with a more granu-lar score than those used in China's pilot \"social credit\" schemes, which already aim to give every citizen a public social- reputation score based on things like social-media connections and buying habits. Algorithms could monitor her digital data score, along with everyone else's, continu-ously, without ever feeling the fatigue that hit Stasi o cers working the late shift. False positives\u2014deeming someone a threat for innocuous behavior\u2014would be encour-aged, in order to boost the system's built-in chilling e ects, so that she'd turn her sharp eyes on her own behavior, to avoid the slightest appearance of dissent. If her risk factor /f_l uctuated upward\u2014 whether due to some suspicious pattern in her movements, her social associations, her insu cient attention to a propaganda-consumption app, or some correlation known only to the AI\u2014a purely auto-mated system could limit her movement. It could prevent her from purchasing plane or train tickets. It could disallow passage through checkpoints. It could remotely commandeer \"smart locks\" in public or private spaces, to con/f_i ne her until security forces arrived.AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE WITH ENOUGH PROCESSING POWER COULD FEED EVERY BLIP OF A CITIZEN'S NEURAL ACTIVITY INTO A GOVERNMENT DATABASE.

In the spring of 2019, Yi published \"/T_he Beijing AI Principles,\" a manifesto on AI's poten-tial to interfere with autonomy, dignity, privacy, and a host of other human values. It was Yi whom I'd come to visit at Bei- jing's Institute of Automation, where, in addi-tion to his work on AI ethics, he serves as the deputy director of the Research Center for Brain-Inspired Intelligence. He retrieved me from the lobby. Yi looked young for his age, 37, with kind eyes and a solid frame slimmed down by black sweatpants and a hoodie. On the way to Yi's oce, we passed one of his labs, where a research assistant hov-ered over a microscope, watching electro-chemical signals /f_lash neuron-to-neuron through mouse-brain tissue. We sat down at a long table in a conference room adjoin-ing his oce, taking in the gray, fogged-in cityscape while his assistant fetched tea. I asked Yi how \"/T_he Beijing AI Principles\" had been received. \"People say, '/T_his is just an ocial show from the Beijing govern ment,' \" he told me. \"But this is my life's work.\" Yi talked freely about AI's potential misuses. He mentioned a project deployed to a select group of Chinese schools, where facial recognition was used to track not just student attendance but also whether individual students were paying attention. \"I hate that software,\" Yi said. \"I have to use that word: hate.\" He went on like this for a while, enu- merating various unethical applications of AI. \"I teach a course on the philosophy of AI,\" he said. \"I tell my students that I hope none of them will be involved in killer robots. /T_hey have only a short time on Earth. /T_here are many other things they could be doing with their future.\" Yi clearly knew the academic literature on tech ethics cold. But when I asked him about the political ecacy of his work, his answers were less compelling. \"Many of us technicians have been invited to speak to the government, and even to Xi Jinping, about AI's potential risks,\" he said. \"But the government is still in a learning phase, just like other govern-ments worldwide.\"\"Do you have anything stronger than that consultative process?\" I asked. \"Sup-pose there are times when the government has interests that are in con/f_lict with your principles. What mechanism are you count-ing on to win out?\" \"I, personally, am still in a learning phase on that problem,\" Yi said. Chinese AI start-ups aren't nearly as bothered. Several are helping Xi develop AI for the express purpose of surveillance. /T_he combination of China's single-party rule and the ideological residue of central plan-ning makes party elites powerful in every domain, especially the economy. But in the past, the connection between the govern-ment and the tech industry was discreet. Recently, the Chinese government started assigning representatives to tech /f_irms, to augment the Communist Party cells that exist within large private companies. Selling to the state security services is one of the fastest ways for China's AI start-ups to turn a profit. A national telecom /f_irm is the largest shareholder of iFlytek, China's voice-recognition giant. Synergies abound: When police use iFlytek's software to monitor calls, state-owned newspapers provide favorable coverage. Earlier this year, the personalized-news app Toutiao went so far as to rewrite its mission to articulate a new animating goal: aligning public opin-ion with the government's wishes. Xu Li, the CEO of SenseTime, recently described the government as his company's \"largest data source.\" Whether any private data can be ensured protection in China isn't clear, given the country's political structure. /T_he digital revolution has made data monopo-lies dicult to avoid. Even in America, which has a sophisticated tradition of anti-trust enforcement, the citizenry has not yet summoned the will to force information about the many out of the hands of the powerful few. But private data monopolies are at least subject to the sovereign power of the countries where they operate. A nation-state's data monopoly can be pre-vented only by its people, and only if they possess sucient political power. China's people can't use an election to rid themselves of Xi. And with no indepen-dent judiciary, the government can make an argument, however strained, that it ought to possess any information stream, so long as threats to \"stability\" could be detected among the data points. Or it can demand data from companies behind closed doors, as happened during the initial coronavirus outbreak. No independent press exists to leak news of these demands to. Each time a person's face is recognized, or her voice recorded, or her text messages intercepted, this information could be attached, instantly, to her government-ID number, police records, tax returns, property /f_ilings, and employment history. It could be cross-referenced with her medical records and DNA, of which the Chinese police boast they have the world's largest collection. YI AND I talked through a global scenario that has begun to worry AI ethicists and China-watchers alike. In this scenario, most AI researchers around the world come to recognize the technology's risks to humanity, and develop strong norms around its use. All except for one coun-try, which makes the right noises about AI ethics, but only as a cover. Meanwhile, this country builds turnkey national sur-veillance systems, and sells them to places where democracy is fragile or non existent. /T_he world's autocrats are usually felled by coups or mass protests, both of which require a baseline of political organization. But large-scale political organization could prove impossible in societies watched by pervasive automated surveillance. Yi expressed worry about this scenario, but he did not name China speci/f_ically. He didn't have to: /T_he country is now the world's leading seller of AI-powered sur-veillance equipment. In Malaysia, the gov-ernment is working with Yitu, a Chinese AI start-up, to bring facial- recognition technology to Kuala Lumpur's police as a complement to Alibaba's City Brain platform. Chinese companies also bid to out/f_it every one of Singapore's 110,000 lampposts with facial-recognition cameras. In South Asia, the Chinese government has supplied surveillance equipment to Sri Lanka. On the old Silk Road, the Chi-nese company Dahua is lining the streets of Mongolia's capital with AI-assisted sur-veillance cameras. Farther west, in Serbia, Huawei is helping set up a \"safe-city sys-tem,\" complete with facial-recognition 0920_WEL_Anderson_China /six.taboldstyle/five.taboldstylePHOTOGRAPH BY ZHOU NA /six.taboldstyle/six.taboldstylecameras and joint patrols conducted by Serbian and Chinese police aimed at help-ing Chinese tourists to feel safe. In the early aughts, the Chinese tele- com titan ZTE sold Ethiopia a wireless network with built-in backdoor access for the government. In a later crackdown, dis-sidents were rounded up for brutal inter-rogations, during which they were played audio from recent phone calls they'd made. Today, Kenya, Uganda, and Mauritius are out/f_itting major cities with Chinese-made surveillance networks. In Egypt, Chinese developers are look- ing to /f_inance the construction of a new capital. It's slated to run on a \"smart city\" platform similar to City Brain, although a vendor has not yet been named. In south-ern Africa, Zambia has agreed to buy more than $1/uni00A0billion in telecom equipment from China, including internet-monitoring tech-nology. China's Hikvision, the world's larg-est manufacturer of AI-enabled cameras, has an oce in Johannesburg. China uses \"predatory lending to sell telecommunications equipment at a sig-ni/f_icant discount to developing countries, which then puts China in a position to control those networks and their data,\" Michael Kratsios, America's CTO, told me. When countries need to re/f_inance the terms of their loans, China can make net-work access part of the deal, in the same way that its military secures base rights at foreign ports it /f_inances. \"If you give [China] unfettered access to data networks around the world, that could be a serious problem,\" Kratsios said. In 2018, CloudWalk Technology, a Guangzhou-based start-up spun out of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, inked a deal with the Zimbabwean govern-ment to set up a surveillance network. Its terms require Harare to send images of its inhabitants\u2014a rich data set, given that Zimbabwe has absorbed migration /f_lows from all across sub-Saharan Africa\u2014back to CloudWalk's Chinese oces, allowing the company to fine-tune its software's ability to recognize dark-skinned faces, which have previously proved tricky for its algorithms. Having set up beachheads in Asia, Europe, and Africa, China's AI compa-nies are now pushing into Latin Amer-ica, a region the Chinese government describes as a \"core economic interest.\" China /f_inanced Ecuador's $240/uni00A0million purchase of a surveillance-camera system. Bolivia, too, has bought surveillance equip-ment with help from a loan from Beijing. Venezuela recently debuted a new national ID-card system that logs citizens' politi-cal aliations in a database built by ZTE. In a grim irony, for years Chinese com-panies hawked many of these surveillance products at a security expo in Xinjiang, the home province of the Uighurs. IF CHINA IS able to surpass America in AI, it will become a more potent geopoliti-cal force, especially as the standard-bearer of a new authoritarian alliance. China already has some of the world's largest data sets to feed its AI systems, a crucial advantage for its researchers. In cavernous mega-oces in cities across the country, low-wage workers sit at long tables for long hours, transcribing audio /f_iles and outlining objects in images, to make the data generated by China's massive popula-tion more useful. But for the country to best America's AI ecosystem, its vast troves of data will have to be sifted through by algorithms that recognize patterns well beyond those grasped by human insight. And even executives at China's search giant Baidu concede that the top echelon of AI talent resides in the West. Historically, China struggled to retain elite quants, most of whom left to study in America's peerless computer- science departments, before working at Silicon Valley's more interesting, better-resourced companies. But that may be changing. /T_he T rump administration has made it difficult for Chinese students to study in the United States, and those who are able to are viewed with suspicion. A lead-ing machine-learning scientist at Google recently described visa restrictions as \"one of the largest bottlenecks to our collective research productivity.\" Meanwhile, Chinese computer-science departments have gone all-in on AI. /T_hree of the world's top 10 AI universities, in terms of the volume of research they pub-lish, are now located in China. And that's before the country /f_inishes building the 50 new AI research centers mandated by Xi's \"AI Innovation Action Plan for Institutions Yi Zeng, photographed in his office at the Institute of Automation, in Beijing, July 2020. Yi, the author of \"The Beijing AI Principles,\" has been a lonely voice in China warning that government misuse of AI could pose a threat to humanity. 0920_WEL_Anderson_China [Print]_13880782.indd 66 7/13/2020 5:57:57 PM66 /six.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyleof 36/uni00A0percent of global AI private-equity investment in 2017, up from just 3/uni00A0percent in 2015. Talented Chinese engi-neers can stay home for school and work for a globally sexy homegrown company like TikTok after graduation. China will still lag behind America in computing hardware in the near term. Just as data must be processed by algorithms to be useful, algorithms must be instanti-ated in physical strata\u2014speci/f_i cally, in the innards of microchips. /T_h ese gossamer sil-icon structures are so intricate that a few missing atoms can reroute electrical pulses through the chips' neuronlike switches. /T_h e most sophisticated chips are arguably the most complex objects yet built by humans. /T_h ey're certainly too complex to be quickly pried apart and reverse- engineered by Chi-na's vaunted corporate- espionage artists. Chinese /f_i rms can't yet build the best of the best chip-fabrication rooms, which cost billions of dollars and rest on decades of compounding institutional knowledge. Nitrogen-cooled and seismically isolated, to prevent a passing truck's rumble from ruin-ing a microchip in vitro, these automated rooms are as much a marvel as their /f_i n-ished silicon wafers. And the best ones are still mostly in the United States, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. America's government is still able to limit the hardware that flows into China, a state of a airs that the Commu-nist Party has come to resent. When the T rump administration banned the sale of microchips to ZTE in April 2018, Frank Long, an analyst who specializes in China's AI sector, described it as a wake-up call for China on par with America's experience of the Arab oil embargo. But the AI revolution has dealt China a rare leapfrogging opportunity. Until recently, most chips were designed with /f_l exible architecture that allows for many types of computing operations. But AI runs fastest on custom chips, like those Google uses for its cloud computing to instantly spot your daughter's face in thou-sands of photos. (Apple performs many of these operations on the iPhone with a cus-tom neural-engine chip.) Because everyone is making these custom chips for the /f_i rst time, China isn't as far behind: Baidu and Alibaba are building chips customized for deep learning. And in August/uni00A02019, Hua-wei unveiled a mobile machine-learning chip. Its design came from Cambricon, perhaps the global chip-making industry's most valuable start-up, which was founded by Yi's colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. By 2030, AI supremacy might be within range for China. /T_h e country will likely have the world's largest economy, and new money to spend on AI applications for its military. It may have the most sophisticated drone swarms. It may have autonomous weapons systems that can forecast an adver-sary's actions after a brief exposure to a the-ater of war, and make battle/f_i eld decisions much faster than human cognition allows. Its missile-detection algorithms could void America's /f_i rst-strike nuclear advantage. AI could upturn the global balance of power. ON MY WAY OUT of the Institute of Automation, Yi took me on a tour of his robotics lab. In the high-ceilinged room, grad students /f_i ddled with a giant disem-bodied metallic arm and a small human-oid robot wrapped in a gray exoskeleton while Yi told me about his work model-ing the brain. He said that understanding the brain's structure was the surest way to understand the nature of intelligence. I asked Yi how the future of AI would unfold. He said he could imagine software modeled on the brain acquiring a series of abilities, one by one. He said it could achieve some semblance of self-recognition, and then slowly become aware of the past and the future. It could develop motivations and values. /T_h e /f_i nal stage of its assisted evolution would come when it understood other agents as worthy of empathy. I asked him how long this process would take. \"I think such a machine could be built by 2030,\" Yi said. Before bidding Yi farewell, I asked him to imagine things unfolding another way. \"Suppose you /f_i nish your digital, high- resolution model of the brain,\" I said. \"And suppose it attains some rudimentary form of consciousness. And suppose, over time, you're able to improve it, until it out-performs humans in every cognitive task, with the exception of empathy. You keep it locked down in safe mode until you achieve that last step. But then one day, the government's security services break down your o ce door. /T_h ey know you have this AI on your computer. /T_h ey want to use it as the software for a new hardware platform, an arti/f_i cial humanoid soldier. /T_h ey've already manufactured a billion of them, and they don't give a damn if they're wired with empathy. /T_h ey demand your password. Do you give it to them?\" \"I would destroy my computer and leave,\" Yi said. \"Really?\" I replied.\"Yes, really,\" he said. \"At that point, it would be time to quit my job and go focus on robots that create art.\" If you were looking for a philosopher- king to chart an ethical developmental \"I TELL MY STUDENTS THAT I HOPE NONE OF THEM WILL BE INVOLVED IN KILLER ROBOTS.

But the development path of AI will be shaped by overlapping systems of local, national, and global politics, not by a wise and benevolent philosopher-king. /T_h at's why China's ascent to AI supremacy is such a menacing prospect: /T_h e country's political structure encourages, rather than restrains, this technology's worst uses. Even in the U.S., a democracy with constitutionally enshrined human rights, Americans are struggling mightily to pre-vent the emergence of a public-private surveillance state. But at least America has political structures that stand some chance of resistance. In China, AI will be restrained only according to the party's needs. It was nearly noon when I /f_i nally left the institute. /T_h e day's rain was in its last hour. Yi ordered me a car and walked me to meet it, holding an umbrella over my head. I made my way to the Forbidden City, Beijing's historic seat of imperial power. Even this short trip to the city cen-ter brought me into contact with China's surveillance state. Before entering Tianan-men Square, both my passport and my face were scanned, an experience I was becoming numb to. In the square itself, police holding body-size bulletproof shields jogged in single-/f_i le lines, weaving paths through throngs of tourists. /T_h e heavy police pres-ence was a chilling reminder of the stu-dent protesters who were murdered here in 1989. China's AI-patrolled Great Firewall was built, in part, to make sure that mas-sacre is never discussed on its internet. To dodge algorithmic censors, Chinese activ-ists rely on memes\u2014Tank Man approach-ing ducky\u2014to commemorate the students' murder. The party's AI-powered censorship extends well beyond Tiananmen. Earlier this year, the government arrested Chi-nese programmers who were trying to preserve disappeared news stories about the corona virus pandemic. Some of the articles in their database were banned because they were critical of Xi and the party. /T_h ey survived only because inter-net users reposted them on social media, interlaced with coded language and emo-jis designed to evade algorithms. Work-arounds of this sort are short-lived: Xi's domestic critics used to make fun of him with images of Winnie the Pooh, but those too are now banned in China. /T_h e party's ability to edit history and culture, by force, will become more sweeping and precise, as China's AI improves. Wresting power from a government that so thoroughly controls the informa-tion environment will be di cult. It may take a million acts of civil disobedience, like the laptop-destroying scenario imag-ined by Yi. China's citizens will have to stand with their students. Who can say what hardships they may endure? China's citizens don't yet seem to be radicalized against surveillance. /T_h e pan-demic may even make people value pri-vacy less, as one early poll in the U.S. sug-gests. So far, Xi is billing the government's response as a triumphant \"people's war,\" another old phrase from Mao, referring to the mobilization of the whole population to smash an invading force. /T_h e Chinese people may well be more pliant now than they were before the virus. But evidence suggests that China's young people\u2014at least some of them\u2014resented the government's initial secrecy about the outbreak. For all we know, some new youth movement on the mainland is biding its time, waiting for the right moment to make a play for democracy. The people of Hong Kong certainly sense the danger of this techno-political moment. The night before I arrived in China, more than 1/uni00A0million protesters had poured into the island's streets. (/T_h e free state newspaper in my Beijing hotel described them, falsely, as police support-ers.) A great many held umbrellas over their heads, in solidarity with student pro-testers from years prior, and to keep their faces hidden. A few tore down a lamp-post on the suspicion that it contained a facial-recognition camera. Xi has since tightened his grip on the region with a \"national-security law,\" and there is little that outnumbered Hong Kongers can do about it, at least not without help from a movement on the mainland. During my visit to Tiananmen Square, I didn't see any protesters. People mostly milled about peacefully, posing for sel/f_i es with the oversize portrait of Mao. /T_h ey held umbrellas, but only to keep the August sun o their faces. Walking in their midst, I kept thinking about the contingency of his-tory: /T_h e political systems that constrain a technology during its early development profoundly shape our shared global future. We have learned this from our adventures in carbon-burning. Much of the planet's political trajectory may depend on just how dangerous China's people imagine AI to be in the hands of centralized power. Until they secure their personal liberty, at some unimaginable cost, free people every-where will have to hope against hope that the world's most intelligent machines are made elsewhere.

BUT WHAT MASTERCLASS REALL Y DELIVERS IS SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT. BY CARINA CHOCANO ILLUSTRATIONS BY JADE PURPLE 7/13/2020 12:42:46 PMSEPTEMBER 2020 /seven.taboldstyle/two.taboldstyleSometimes an advertisement is so perfectly tailored to a cultural moment that it casts that moment into stark relief, which is how I felt upon /f_irst seeing an ad for the mega-best-selling writer James Patterson's course on MasterClass a few years ago. In the ad, Patterson is sitting at a table, reciting a twisty opening line in voice-over. /T_hen an overhead shot of him gazing out a window, lost in thought like a character in a movie. A title card appears: \"Imagine taking a writing class from a master.\" It didn't matter that I'd never read a book by Patterson before\u2014I was hooked. What appealed to me was not whatever actionable thriller-writing tips I might glean, but rather the promise of his story, the story of how a writer becomes a mogul. Any hapless, hand-to-mouth mid-lister can provide instructions on outlining a novel. Master-Class dangled something else, a clear-cut path out of the precariat, the magic-bean shortcut to a fairy-tale ending\u2014 the secret to ever-elusive success. MasterClass launched in 2015 with just three classes: Dustin Homan on acting, Serena Williams on tennis, and Patterson on writing. Since then the company has grown exponentially, raising $135/uni00A0million in venture capital from 2012 to 2018. It now has more than 85 classes across nine categories. (Last year it added 25 new classes, and this year it intends to add even more.) After the pandemic hit, as people started spending more time at home, its subscriptions surged, some weeks increasing tenfold over the average in 2019; subscribers spent twice as much time on the platform as they did earlier this year. In April, the company moved from oering individual classes for $90 a pop, with an all-access annual pass for $180, to a subscription-only model, and in May, it raised another $100/uni00A0million. Its trailers have become so familiar and ubiquitous that they spawned their own SNL parodies, \"Master Class: Quarantine Edition,\" in which Chloe Fineman appears as Phoebe Waller-Bridge for a class on journaling, as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for a class on fashion, and as Britney Spears for a class on/uni00A0... something. MasterClass trailers tend to follow a certain playbook: the introduction of a famous person; a peek behind the curtain; an overview of their setbacks and failures; the promise of what you might learn; the emotional, soaring soundtrack. But the courses are distinct from one another\u2014there's no standard format or formula. What MasterClass purports to provide is a premium, high-level learning experience via a series of glossy videos taught by the world's best. In some classes, instructors address the cam-era for a few hours. In others, they are more hands-on, demon-strating techniques or leading workshops. You can take writing classes with Margaret Atwood, Dan Brown, David Baldacci, Joyce Carol Oates, David Sedaris, Shonda Rhimes, Malcolm Gladwell, or Aaron Sorkin. You can take photography with Annie Leibo-vitz; acting with Natalie Portman; comedy with Judd Apatow or Steve Martin; and cooking with /T_homas Keller, Gordon Ram-say, or Alice Waters. /T_here's a directing class with Ron Howard, a makeup class with Bobbi Brown, a negotiation class with the former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss, and a class on how to be a boss with Anna Wintour. RuPaul has a class on authenticity and self-expression, and Neil deGrasse Tyson has one on scien-ti/f_ic thinking. T wo classes\u2014taught by Kevin Spacey and Homan\u2014 have been removed following allegations of sexual misconduct against the actors (which both have denied). MasterClass is a brand built on other people's impeccable brands. DAVID ROGIER, who co-founded MasterClass, likes to tell the story of his grandmother who as a young woman /f_led the Nazis, emigrating to the United States with her mother. After working in a factory for years, she applied to medical schools and was rejected by dozens of them\u2014one dean /f_lat-out told her that she had three strikes against her: She was a woman, she was Jewish, and she was an immigrant\u2014until she /f_inally found one that would accept her. She always impressed upon her grandson that an education could never be taken away from you. /T_hat was the grain of the idea for MasterClass. It's a great origin story, the kind perfectly suited for a MasterClass trailer, and also the kind that every young Silicon Valley founder is more or less ready to recite when the press comes along. But the story sits somewhat uncomfortably alongside the actual product, which is to a medical degree what an apple is to an orange planet. Rogier grew up on the Westside of Los Angeles, the son of two lawyers who became artists in retirement. After getting his M.B.A. at Stanford, he asked one of his professors\u2014 the angel investor Michael Dearing, who founded Harrison Metal, a seed-stage venture-capital fund in San Francisco\u2014 for a job. Rogier got the posi-tion, but after a year or so realized it wasn't for him. He went to Dearing and told him he planned to quit. When Dearing asked what he had lined up, Rogier responded, \" 'I'm going to build something.' He's like, 'What?' I said, 'I don't know.' So he wrote me a check for about half a million dollars.\" Rogier formed a holding company and called it Yanka Industries, after his grandmother. /T_he question of who (and what and how and why) gets funded in Silicon Valley might not be asked often enough, considering the impact of technology on our society, economy, politics, and daily lives. But patterns are discernible: Mainly, the ideas that rise to the top are OPENING SPREAD: GRAHAM DENHOLM / address de/f_iciencies in an industry by creat- ing a new category from within the old one, the way caterpillars consume themselves to become butter/f_lies. (Also, most of these ideas are had by young white guys.) T urning the housing mar-ket into an in/f_inite unregulated hotel, for instance, or everyone's cars into an unregulated /f_leet of taxis. Or aggregating mastery across disciplines. \"I felt a lot of pressure,\" Rogier told me of the windfall invest- ment. He was aware that he'd been given a gift. \"You can't whine about it or complain about it, because there's nothing to whine or complain about, right? /T_his guy threw me a blank check.\" Rogier knew he wanted to do something related to education, but he wasn't sure what. So he posted ads on Craigslist oering to pay people $25 an hour to talk about their experiences with education. He asked subjects about the schools they'd gone to, whom they'd learned from the most, the topics they wished they had studied more. What things did they want to learn now? How did they want to learn now? Rogier already knew life was changing at a much faster rate than it had for his parents' generation. What you learn in school no longer lasts you through your career. His research showed that people are willing to invest in personal growth and education, but many feel \"ripped o\" by their education. He isn't referring only to formal education. \"People pay tremendous amounts to take not-great classes,\" he said. \"And then there are also the scam stories. Somebody went to school to be a receptionist, and she paid for it, but the 'school' was answering phone calls for two weeks at an oce.\" Rogier had an idea: What if anybody could learn from the best? \"/T_hat would be kind of awesome,\" he said. Especially if he could oer the class at a relatively low price. After two rounds of fund raising, getting the /f_irst instruc-tors on board (Homan was the /f_irst to agree\u2014Rogier was school friends with his daughter), /f_ilming some test classes, and hiring a small team, Rogier asked a friend, the entrepreneur Aaron Rasmussen, to join the company as co-founder and chief technology ocer, which he did. (Rasmussen left the company in Janu-ary/uni00A02017 and later founded the for-college-credit education platform Outlier.org.) At /f_irst, Rogier said, many people told him his idea would never work. It was unclear whether people would pay to watch high-end tutorials when they could view lower-budget ones on YouT ube for free. It was also unclear whether celebrity teachers could be recruited in meaningful numbers. /T_he best in the world will never want to teach, people told him. /T_hey're not going to be good at teach- ing. People aren't going to want to learn from them. It's going to be too expensive. People won't pay for production\u2014 they won't care if it's higher production quality. Everything's free on the web. Why are you trying to do everything from mak-ing the classes to putting the classes out? You should just take one small slice. One of the things Rogier is still often asked is whether he's selling education or entertainment. /T_he question annoys him. \"Why can't education also be entertaining?\" Rogier always knew that part of being an entrepreneur is believing in something that nobody else believes in, but still, he was scared. Within a few days of MasterClass's launch in May/uni00A02015, however, the numbers told him he was onto something. Within four months, he had 30,000 students. MASTERCLASS Opening spread, clockwise from top left: MasterClass instructors Serena Williams (who teaches tennis on the platform); Natalie Portman (acting); Gordon Ramsay [Print]_13889113.indd 73 7/13/2020 12:42:47 PM MISSION, as it was originally de/f_ined, was to \"democratize access to genius.\" But the service actually oers something dierent\u2014 although what that is, exactly, is hard to put your /f_inger on. Strictly speaking, a master class is a small class for very advanced students taught by a master in their /f_ield. But very advanced students in particular subject areas are vanishingly small cohorts\u2014certainly not enough to attract hundreds of mil-lions of dollars in investments. And so, MasterClass courses are not really designed for a speci/f_ic skill level, but instead are aimed at the most general of general audiences. MasterClass doesn't disclose how much it pays instructors, although a 2018 Bloomberg article reported that they are paid a guaranteed sum, plus up to 25 percent of revenue generated by their classes. (In 2017, /T_he Hollywood Reporter claimed that instructors were paid roughly $100,000.) But money is not the only motivation. For many of the instructors, MasterClass presents an opportunity to take stock of a remarkable career. Wintour, the longtime editor of Vogue, kicks o her MasterClass by saying, \"I know many people are curious about who I am, how I approach my work, and what I believe/uni00A0... I have never had the opportunity to share the many lessons I have learned as an editor and as a creative leader in one place before.\" Her class feels, more than anything, like a historical document. For Atwood, the celebrated author of The Handmaid's T ale , among many other novels, the decision to participate was partly motivated by her age, \"which is old,\" she told me over the phone. \"/T_his is a way of downloading what I would ordinarily do, or pos-sibly uploading it.\" /T_he last time Atwood taught full-time at a university was in 1970s. Filming a MasterClass was an opportunity to reach a less-privileged cohort than she might in a university setting. \"For a lot of people who might have jobs, but also might be interested in writing, [Master-Class is] a way they can pursue this in their own time, at their own pace,\" she said. On the other hand, Atwood said, \"in-person teaching is inter active. People get to ask you direct questions.\" Later she added, \"If you're teaching in a university, you can see the people you're teaching. You know how old they are. You have some idea about what background they may have come from. You usually start asking them what were the last /f_ive books that they read/uni00A0... But if you're doing something online, it could be anybody. It's more like publishing a book. It's out there. It's accessible. You don't know who may be accessing it.\" As an educational platform, MasterClass is limited by its instructors' inaccessibility. But as a repository for career advice and discussions about the creative process and how to navigate life as an artist (or athlete, chef, magician, entrepreneur), it's a gold mine. When you are just starting out\u2014 especially if you lack connections in your areas of interest\u2014it can be helpful to hear how other people \"did it,\" what obstacles they faced and how they overcame them. You might get a hit of encouragement or see yourself re/f_lected for the /f_irst time in a /f_ield you thought was o-limits to you. /T_he ballet dancer Misty Copeland says Master-Class was a way of doing this. Copeland's class is typical of MasterClass's more inspirational oerings. It's a mix of instruction and aspiration, covering subjects on everything from owning your power and being con/f_ident, to barre exercises (pli\u00e9s, tendus), to working with Prince, to the importance of mentorship and diversity, to showing people that ballet is more approachable than they think. \"/T_he /f_ine arts and classical dance have been kind of categorized as this elite form that is only for an elite, exclusive category of peo-ple,\" Copeland\u2014the /f_irst Black principal dancer of the prestigious American Ballet /T_heatre\u2014told me over the phone. She wanted to show that dance didn't have to be so intimidating\u2014\"that it's for every person, with any background and body type.\" For Copeland, the tools, perseverance, strength, and passion that you need to be an artist are derived from doing the work, engaging in the process. /T_hat's what she aimed to share in her class, to \"give people some insight into what it is to be an artist and an athlete.\" I've taken Atwood's class, Rhimes's class, and most of Gladwell's, among others. I've watched Part One of Keller's course, and a little bit of Part T wo. I've watched Brown's \"smoky eye\" tutorial, tried the technique on myself, and came out look-ing like a prize/f_ighting panda. /T_he classes are visually sumptuous, transporting, uplifting, and yet, frankly, a little boring, especially if you try to watch them all the way through. Doing so feels like being seated next to the dinner guest of your dreams\u2014the Dalai Lama or Oscar Wilde or Barack Obama\u2014and discovering that they won't stop talking and that the dinner is 12 courses long.

Yet, after watching Gordon Ramsay do it, I did /f_inally learn how to properly salt an eggplant. Instructors approach their classes in different ways, from simply walking viewers through their practice and methods, to putting their teams to work on a comprehensive curriculum, as Keller did upon being asked to come up with a class. But Keller was told his curriculum was too much. \"From what they told me, they'd never seen anything like it before, both in presentation, as well as in content, as well as in length,\" Keller said when we spoke. It would have been much too long to /f_ilm, so it was distilled down to the fundamentals and split into three parts. Having someone of /T_homas Keller's stature teaching the basics of cooking is impressive, but is it necessary? You can learn useful things by watching a video, but formal education is generally understood to demand some kind of participation, as well as a teacher evaluation. Some instructors host promotional contests with student participation\u2014in one case, James Patterson co-wrote a book with a student\u2014but in general, Malcolm Gladwell isn't going to grade your essay, nor is /T_homas Keller going to evalu-ate your meringue. AS TERRIBLE AS the pandemic has been, it has proved unex- pectedly good for some\u2014speci/f_ically billionaires, yeast manufac-turers, and streaming services, of which MasterClass is now one. For a certain cohort of people looking to pass the hours at home, namely those with leisure time and money, the new courses in cooking, mixology, and gardening arrived at the perfect home-steading moment. But the fact that MasterClass is so popular now also speaks to people's fears, especially economic uncertainties that have only been exacerbated by the pandemic. Tens of millions of/uni00A0jobs have been lost, and many newly unemployed people are looking for a dierent direction. And if they've kept their jobs, they are dealing with a whole new way of navigating work, which is stressful and confusing. In a way, MasterClass seems ideally suited to frustrated 30- somethings for whom education has not necessarily resulted in upward mobility or even a job, who feel stuck in their career without a clear path to success. In fact, the company refers to its target customers as CATS: \"curious, aspiring 30-somethings.\" CATS are old enough not to be planning to return to school, but young enough, in theory, that they need help advancing in their career. A CAT is a person whose life has become complicated, who has had to put aside some of the things they loved to do, who isn't exactly doing the thing they dreamed of doing, David Schriber, MasterClass's chief marketing ocer, told me. /T_hey're anxious about their future, their present, their position relative to that of their peers. \"/T_hey'll talk about having anxiety that their co-workers or the people on their social networks all seem to know more about a subject than they do,\" Schriber said, referring, presumably, to pre-pandemic focus testing. \"Someone will come to the oce party and talk about wine, and then they'll feel like I don 't know enough about wine . Someone else will talk about photography, and they'll be like Man, I should pay attention to who the photographers are these days . Or their boss will say things like 'You need to work on your leadership pro/f_ile, or hone your creative judgments,' and the poor 30-something is like Where am I gonna get all this? \" Something about this struck me as clammy and sad, as far away from /T_hey can 't take your education away from you as it's possible to be.

What MasterClass oers 30-somethings is world's best,\" who are \"breaking down the thing that they do in a really entertaining and digest-ible way,\" Schriber said. \"You can take away the life lessons, but you can also take away the conversation points. You can come back to work on Monday and talk about what Anna Wintour did for the Met Gala\u2014you can also think, Man, Anna Wintour really gave me permission to show up like a boss today. \" But what does it mean to \"show up like a boss\" at this moment? And what does it mean to learn it from Anna Wintour, who has recently come under /f_ire for allegedly feeding a toxic and racist culture at Cond\u00e9 Nast? /T_he idea that everyone should show up like a boss, so current /f_ive years ago, feels hollow now that the brutal inequalities in our system have become undeniable to all but the most willfully obtuse. Education researchers have known for decades that being good at something and being good at teaching something are two com-pletely dierent skill sets. In fact, universities are mostly ranked on the strength of their research, and, of course, the brand name can be worth a lot. Something similar holds true for MasterClass, whose impressive roster of talent feels like a who's who of elite professionals, a gallery of the meritocracy's winners. TO UNDERSTAND where we are right now, and why Master- Class seems to slot in so perfectly with the moment, it's useful to think about how it has evolved over time. MasterClass launched after the early hype around online edu- cation had already /f_izzled. Filmed university lectures seemed to be even less thrilling than the real thing. MOOCs (massive open online courses) had poor retention rates, and still structurally favored people of means. At /f_irst, MasterClass focused on speci/f_ic skill sets, and providing an educational journey from beginning to end. But its data revealed that people weren't necessarily con-suming the courses from start to /f_inish, nor was this really nec-essary to bene/f_it from the content. \"What we were /f_inding was that when people were allowed the freedom to jump from lesson to lesson based on their interest, it was just a much more free-ing experience,\" Nekisa Cooper, MasterClass's vice president of content, told me. What people seemed to want was a fun mix of short-form inspirational content. /T_hey also displayed surprisingly wide-ranging interests. Students who /f_irst watched Bobbi Brown followed her up with Chris Voss. Lately, MasterClass has started presenting its oerings less as classroom education and more as part of a learning lifestyle built around a community of people with common interests and concerns. It reminds me of a kind of Spotify for careerist inspira-tion, a platform for dispensing assorted self-help and personal-development bonbons for the young capitalist striver. \"And we're not just oering classes or education,\" Cooper said. \"We're also oering escape.\" As for whether it matters if a MasterClass member /f_inishes a course, Rogier said, \"Most education sites look at completion rates. But I think that's the wrong metric. /T_he measure I look at is what's the impact we have on your life. I know it's going to sound /f_luy, but we legitimately ask people if we changed their life\"\u2014which nearly 20/uni00A0percent of those polled said it did. Silicon Valley has talked about changing the world and peo- ple's lives for a long time, and it's safe to say that it has succeeded. /T_he world has been remade by private equity and venture capital. Tech has \"disrupted\" almost every aspect of modern living. Maybe it's not a coincidence, then, that we /f_ind ourselves in a golden age of self-help and self-development, of \"how I did it\" podcasts and conferences and workshops. We're encouraged to optimize ourselves at all times, and told to look upon this as fun, albeit compulsory. But although you can get a lot out of these activities, you can waste time looking for the answer, when what these stories all reveal is that great success is a combination of doing the work and getting (or perhaps starting out) really, really lucky. Lately, I've been thinking about how prospectors in the Cali- fornia Gold Rush rarely struck it rich. In 1849, the ones who did well were those who supplied prospectors with shovels, tents, and jeans\u2014they kept the dream alive. Samuel Brannan, who sold shovels and other goods, was considered California's /f_irst millionaire. Levi Strauss, who co-invented blue jeans, died with a fortune of $6/uni00A0million, worth $175/uni00A0million today. /T_here's nothing wrong, of course, with supplying people with what they need to pursue their dreams, but it seems that during this time of growing wealth and social inequality, the jeans and shovels have become largely symbolic, and the prospecting they facilitate, the endless panning for something, anything, ever more intangible. /T_here is no goal, really. /T_he panning is the goal.

In The Personal History of David Copperfield, Armando Iannucci's mad, loving, and brilliantly cinematic extrapolation of the novel by Charles Dickens, the grown-up hero\u2014now a successful author\u2014attends his own birth. He also, later on, has a consoling, avuncular chat with his frightened boy-self. David Copper/f_ield/uni00A0 (1850) was Dickens's char- acteristically rowdy variant on the inward investiga-tion that William Wordsworth had undertaken in his long poem /T_he Prelude. It was the novel, in the words of Dickens's friend and biographer, John Forster, in which he took \"all the world into his con/f_idence.\" David's labile, one-crush-after-another nature was by all reports close to Dickens's own. And David's story\u2014of being stunted and oppressed by terrible adults (largely of the professional classes); cherished and protected by wonderful adults (largely of the laboring classes); caught for a time in the gears of the Industrial Revolution (working in a factory at the age of 12); surviving, stormily, and by a mighty expansion of his sensibility\u2014is Dickens's life not /f_ictionalized but mythicized. T oday the book reads unevenly and, in a strange way, un-Dickensianly. It billows, it sags, it contracts suddenly to a point of diamond hardness and then billows and sags again. /T_his is Dickens in his middle period, with confused middle-period energies; the fairy-tale intensity of the early work\u2014of, say, Oliver Twist\u2014is behind him, and the sorcerous glooms of Our Mutual Friend are not yet glimpsed. Also: David Copper/f_ield, in manhood, is not an especially interesting person. (\"He's such a drip,\" commented a friend of mine.) But if you can rise above your need for coherence and carefully graded shifts in tone, then David Copper/f_ield becomes a kind of fun-house ride, jolting you about with an almost modern ist brusqueness. /T_he comedy is wild and timeless; the melodrama alien. 0920_CC_Parker_Copperfield [Print]_13863388.indd 78 7/7/2020 6:12:56 PM78SEPTEMBER 2020 /seven.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyleIannucci sometimes knows better than Dickens himself what David Copperfield is about. And because it's Dickens, one character contains this opposition within his own body: the bipolar opti- mist Mr./uni00A0Micawber, always in debt, always speculating. Micawber is a comic creation who sees himself melodra-matically; he makes windy threats of self- destruction, and despairingly /f_lourishes a straight razor in the air, but can be distracted\u2014morally revived, even\u2014by the approach of a hot kidney pudding and a plate of shrimp. Dickens has also introduced into his text the pathogen Uriah Heep, David's great enemy. Heep hates our virtuous hero with a visionary, almost saintly hatred. He hates him like poison, like krypto nite, like the last crawling hypocrisy on Earth. Dickens was a radical artist. Half a century before James Joyce wrote the /f_irst lines of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in shining polymorphous baby talk\u2014 \"Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road\"\u2014Dickens was lowering his language probe into the earliest, most germinal moments of subjectivity. \"/T_he /f_irst objects that assume a distinct presence before me,\" narrates David in the book's second chapter (titled \"I Observe\"), \"as I look far back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty [David's nanny] with no shape at all, and eyes so dark they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face.\" As with Joyce, we are inside the perceptual theater of actual babyhood. Hair, shape, eyes, shadow\u2014the details loom separately, almost unrelatedly, out of a supercharged vagueness. Iannucci's movie /f_lings itself into all of this. /T_he vibration is dreamlike. Sets collapse, or turn into stage curtains that blow open into the next scene. Dev Patel, as David, is gangling, huge-eyed, heavy- breathing: cartoon ish, in the best sense. /T_he multicolored cast-ing is both an anti-hegemonic kick in the ass and a Brechtian device: It keeps us aware of the /f_ictive nature of the proceedings. Excess seems to warp or bulge out of every frame, and every story line wants to go writhing o on its own. /T_here are compressions and contractions; one senses steaming coils of surplus footage, whole subplots excised. Warm work in the editing suite, I imagine. Iannucci, a writer and director on Veep and /T_he Death of Stalin, is the sharpest of comic minds, a mas-ter of competing registers, and he knows what he's doing. Indeed, having the artistic advantage of not being Charles Dickens, of being able to see around the edges of that enormous personality, he knows in a couple of places better than Dickens himself what David Copper/f_ield is about. In one particularly inspired digression, he gives us a long scene in which David ingratiates himself with his fellow schoolboys by means of his gift for impressions: physical carica-tures of teachers and other boys, feats of mimicry, their entertainment value in direct proportion to their cruelty, that have his peers in stitches. /T_his, not to put too /f_ine a point on it, is one way that a writer becomes a writer\u2014by cultivating, as a defense mechanism, a merciless eye for weakness. (Dickens's own talent for impressions became, rather unsettlingly, part of his literary process; his daughter Mamie recorded watching him work one morning, \"when he suddenly jumped from his chair and rushed to a mirror which hung near, and in which I could see the re/f_lection of some extraordinary facial contortions which he was making. He returned rapidly to his desk, wrote furiously for a few moments, and then went again to the mirror.\") Iannucci works magic elsewhere, too. Ben Whishaw as Uriah Heep, his wit playing along the knife edge between self-abasement and contempt, is stranger and more dangerous than even Dickens could manage; in his /f_inal, explosive unmasking\u2014\"You and yours have always hated me and mine!\"\u2014he rears up into nihilistic grandeur, achieving a kind of punk-rock nobility. Dickens was not an egalitarian; he was an everyone's- invited elitist. Beneath his eye we are all aristocrats of human nature, simply by virtue of pos-sessing it. His characters have a hyperbolic presence, a hyperbolic value, and if they are frequently deluded about one another, those delusions just as frequently turn out to be beautiful. David's Aunt Betsey regards her broken-minded lodger, Mr. Dick (limpidly and wonderfully portrayed by Hugh Laurie in the movie), as a man of great wisdom; and so, it transpires, he is. Mrs./uni00A0Micawber has unbudgeable faith in her hopeless husband; her faith is rewarded. This basic grasp of essential human worth was behind Dickens's horror (recognized and saluted by his contemporary and fellow Londoner Karl Marx) at the exploitation of children, working people, and the poor: It was a sort of outraged innocence. \"From the reformer is required a simplicity of surprise,\" wrote G./uni00A0K. Chesterton in his book on Dickens. \"He must have the faculty of a violent and virgin astonishment. It is not enough that he should think injustice dis-tressing; he must think injustice absurd, an anomaly in existence.\" And it's this primal double take\u2014at the shape of this person's nose, at that person's verbal or conceptual tics, at the fact that 12-year-olds can be put to work in factories\u2014that is the keynote of Dickens's work. In his ends were his beginnings; as in Iannucci's movie, the writer supernaturally assisted at the birth of the child, which was his own birth, too. He was, in this way, the complete\u2014the total\u2014novelist. His humanity was enormous, and fully alive to itself. He knew us all so well, and we never stopped blowing his mind. James Parker is a sta writer at /T_he Atlantic . 0920_CC_Parker_Copperfield [Print]_13863388.indd 79 7/7/2020 6:12:56 PM /seven.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyle/eight.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyleIn June 2005, Oprah Winfrey announced a surprising choice as the 55th selection for her in/f_luential book club. /T_he com-ing months would be, she proclaimed, a \"Summer of Faulkner,\" focused on three of his novels\u2014As I Lay Dying, /T_he Sound and the Fury, and Light in August, avail- able in a special 1,100-page box set weigh-ing in at two pounds. Oprah's website posted short videotaped lectures by three literature professors to assist readers in making sense of the writer's notoriously demanding prose. /T_he Faulkner trilogy quickly rose to the No./uni00A02 spot on Ama-zon's best-seller list. Some literary crit-ics hailed Winfrey for bringing William Faulkner back into popular conscious ness; others challenged any notion of recovery or revival, asking whether he had ever really gone away. In the decade and a half since then, the issues of race and history so central to Faulkner's work have grown only more urgent. How should we now regard this pathbreaking, Nobel Prize-winning author, who grappled with our nation's racial tragedy in ways that at once illumi-nate and disturb\u2014that re/f_lect both star-tling human truths and the limitations of a white southerner born in 1897 into the sti/f_ling air of Mississippi's closed and seg-regated society? In our current moment of racial reckoning, Faulkner is certainly ripe for rigorous scrutiny. Michael Gorra, an English professor at Smith, believes Faulkner to be the most important novelist of the 20th century. In his rich, complex, and eloquent new book, The Saddest Words: William Faulkner's Civil War, he makes the case for how and why to read Faulkner in the 21st by revisiting his /f_iction through the lens of the Civil War, \"the central quarrel of our nation's history.\" Rarely an overt subject, one \"not dramatized so much as invoked,\" the Civil War is both \"everywhere\" and \"nowhere\" in Faulkner's work. He cannot escape the war, its aftermath, or its mean-ing, and neither, Gorra insists, can we. As the formerly enslaved Ringo remarks in The Unvanquished/uni00A0(1938) during Reconstruction- era con/f_lict over voting rights, \"/T_his war aint over. Hit just started good.\" /T_his is why for us, as for Jason and Quentin Compson in /T_he Sound and the What to Do About William Faulkner A white man of the Jim Crow South, he couldn't escape the burden of race, yet derived creative force from it.

But he also writes, he confesses, as an \"act of citizenship.\" His book represents his own meditation on the meaning of the \"forever war\" of race, not just in American history and literature, but in our fraught time. What we think today about the Civil War, he believes, \"serves above all to tell us what we think about ourselves, about the nature of our polity and the shape of our history.\" /T_he core of Gorra's book is a Civil War narrative, which he has created by untangling the war's appear-ances throughout Faulkner's /f_iction and rearranging From lay-ers and circularities and recurrences and reversals of Faulkner's 19 novels and more than 100 short sto-ries, Gorra has constructed a chronological telling of Yoknapatawpha's war, of the incidents and characters who appear in the writer's extended chronicle of his invented \"postage stamp\" world. Faulkner took liber-ties with the historical order of events; what he sought to depict was the \"psychological truth of the Con-federate home front\" and the war's aftermath. /T_his is work, Gorra argues, that actual documents of the period would be hard-pressed to do. And that psy-chological truth certainly could not have been derived from study of the racist historiography of Faulkner's era, which he insisted he never even read. Instead, this understanding is the product of what Toni Morrison once called Faulkner's \"refusal-to-look-away approach\" to the burden of his region's cruel past. Faulkner enacts this refusal through his practice of looking again, of revisiting the same characters and stories, and through the prequels and sequels and outgrowths of those he has already told, digging deeply into the hidden and often shocking truths of the South he portrays. Gorra endeavors to unknot and clarify Faulkner's oeuvre by reconstructing it him-self, but his act of literary explication is also one of participation\u2014a joining in the Faulknerian process. Gorra renarrates these Civil War stories as he seeks to come to terms both with America's painful racial legacies and with William Faulkner. Perhaps the most powerful of Faulkner's tellings of the Civil War story is Absalom, Absalom!/uni00A0(1936), a novel structured around Quentin Compson's own refusal to look away. Although Faulkner insisted that Quentin did not speak for him, Gorra has \"never quite believed him.\" Quentin's search to understand why Charles Bon was murdered during the very last days of the war unfolds through his elaboration of successive narratives in a manner not unlike Faulkner's own. Unsatis/f_ied with each version of the story he uncovers, Quentin looks again, arriving through ever more disturbing revelations at the South's original sin: the distorting and dehuman-izing power of race. It is race that pulls the trigger. \"So it's the miscegenation, not the incest, which you cant bear,\" Bon says just before Henry, at once his brother and his /f_ianc\u00e9e's brother, shoots him. To think of this novel appearing in the same year as Gone With the Wind is startling. It was moonlight and magnolias, rather than a searing portrait of the persist-ing legacies of slavery, that captured the public's acclaim: Margaret Mitchell, not Faulkner, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937. But Faulkner's period of \"explo-sive productivity,\" beginning in 1929\u201413 books in 13 years\u2014attracted a dierent sort of attention, because of his formal innovations and literary experimentalism, not just his unvarnished portrayals of race. In a 1939 essay, Jean-Paul Sartre compared him to Proust, and Faulkner became an idol in the eyes of young French intellectuals as well as literary critics around the world. Faulkner might not have won the Pulitzer, but he was on the path to his 1949 Nobel. /G.sc/o.sc/r.sc/r.sc/a.sc /n.sc/o.sc/t.sc/e.sc/s.sc the \"ever-increasing importance of race\" in Faulkner's /f_iction. Yet society's racial attitudes and practices were evolving even more rapidly than Faulkner's own. As the civil-rights movement gained momentum after the end of World War/uni00A0II, Faulkner engaged in more explicit public commentary about America's divisions and inequities. Like critics in those years and ever since, Gorra struggles to come to terms with the distressing views Faulkner frequently articu-lated on questions of racial progress and racial justice. Gorra does not look away from Faulkner's troubling public statements or from some disconcerting stereo-types and assumptions in his literary work that became newly jarring as social attitudes shifted. A great deal is at stake in Gorra's effort. We are in a time when authors' reputations are overturned, their works removed from reading lists, their achieve-ments devalued because of their blindness on ques-tions we now see with dierent eyes. At the outset of his book, Gorra reminds us of persisting debates over Joseph Conrad, initially stimulated by a 1977 Chinua Achebe essay labeling him an apologist for imperialism. Today, Gorra believes, Faulkner \"stands to us as Con-rad does,\" in need of reexamination and an updated under standing that confronts his racist shortcomings. Faulkner, Gorra concedes, \"remained a white man of the Jim Crow South and did not always rise above it. At times his words both can and should make us uncomfortable.\" His /f_iction oers an \"all-too forgiving depiction of slaveholder paternalism.\" His novels and stories fail to render slavery's physical cruelties; they include no depiction of an auction, a family separated Faulkner's fiction fails to render slavery's physical cruelties; it includes no depiction of an auction or a whipping. 0920_CC_Faust_Faulkner [Print]_13863885.indd 81 7/7/2020 5:38:29 PM /eight.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyleSEPTEMBER 2020 /eight.taboldstyle/two.taboldstyleby sale, or a whipping. Many of his Black characters seem incomplete, although they're certainly not the caricatured stereotypes typical of so much white south-ern writing of his time. Faulkner remarked upon white men who had \"the courage and endurance to resist/uni00A0... Reconstruction.\" The Unvanquished presents John Sartoris as a leader of the local Klan admirably deter-mined to keep \"the carpetbaggers from organizing the negroes into an insurrection,\" which was Sartoris's view of the Black claim on the franchise. As Gorra observes, Faulkner's \"picture of black voters as inevitably ignorant and corruptible simply parrots the view of Reconstruc-tion that was current in Faulkner's childhood and for some decades thereafter.\" A 1943 short story Faulkner wrote for /T_he Saturday Evening Post presents the slave broker and Confederate general Nathan Bedford For-rest in a generous manner that Gorra /f_inds particularly \"hard to stomach.\" At the same time, Gorra points out, the depiction of enslaved people /f_leeing to freedom and securing their own emancipation transcends the historiography of Faulkner's time and anticipates that of our own. He is no apologist for the Old South, and resists in any way glorifying the war, unlike almost every other white southerner of his era. /T_he public pronouncements Faulkner made on race as the civil-rights movement unfolded are in many ways even more disturbing than the short-comings Gorra identi/f_ies in his /f_iction. In an appall-ing drunken interview with the British Sunday Times in 1956, Faulkner invoked the specter of race war if the South were compelled to integrate, but when his words were widely reviled, he denied ever having uttered them. He regularly spoke out against lynch-ing and deplored the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, saying that any society that murdered children didn't \"deserve to survive, and probably won't.\" But he had once suggested that mobs, \"like our juries/uni00A0... have a way of being right.\" Gorra underscores the \"incoher-ence\" of Faulkner's position as both critic and defender of the white South's resistance to change. In many ways, he was a quintessential white south- ern \"moderate,\" an identity much scrutinized as the civil-rights movement gathered momentum. He con-demned violence and recognized the need to end seg-regation, but he rejected what Martin Luther King/uni00A0Jr. later described as \"the /f_ierce urgency of now.\" Indeed, it was the moral failures of just such moderates that King would directly assail in his 1963 \"Letter From Birmingham Jail.\" Faulkner urged patience and delay and spoke out against federal coercion of the white South. His critics thought he should have known bet-ter. As James Baldwin explained in a 1956 essay con-demning his views on desegregation, Faulkner hoped to give southern whites the time and opportunity to save themselves, to reclaim their moral identity. But their salvation could come, if at all, only at the cost of postponing justice for Black Americans, which Bald-win made clear was no longer conceivable. Gorra assembles quite a bill of failings, especially if we view Faulkner with the assumptions of our time and place rather than his own. Yet having meticulously acknowledged all of this, Gorra makes his claim for Faulkner the writer by reproving Faulkner the man. \"When writing /f_iction,\" Faulkner \"became better than he was.\" He had, Gorra argues, an uncanny ability to \"think his way within other people,\" to inhabit their being so as to erase preconceptions and prejudices in the very act of portraying their minds and souls. /T_hrough /f_iction, Faulkner could \"stand outside his Oxford, his Jeerson, and see the behavior his people take for granted, the things they don't even question.\" As Gorra presents it, the act of writing bestowed an almost mystical clear-sightedness. Yet that clarity was always challenged in the fetid Mississippi air that Faulkner, like all his characters, had to breathe. And it is that very tension, the combination of the /f_laws and the brilliance, that for Gorra makes his case. Is this rendering of Faulkner's weaknesses as the source of his strength just an act of interpretive jiu-jitsu? Or perhaps a reversion to a romantic notion of redemp-tive genius? Or is Gorra in/f_luenced by what Faulkner himself urged upon posterity: that his life be \"abolished and voided from history,\" leaving only \"the printed books\"? After all, Faulkner once declared that he wanted his epitaph to read \"He made the books and he died.\" But Gorra insists on the importance of the teller and the tale, as well as on the creative force Faulkner derived from the burden of race, which he could not escape. It is because of, not in spite of, Faulkner's short-comings that we must continue to engage with his work: /T_hese failures are product and emblem of the legacies of racial injustice that shape us all. In his Nobel Prize speech in 1950, Faulkner declared that the only thing worth writing about was \"the human heart in con/f_lict with itself.\" He lived that con/f_lict even as he wrote about it. His struggles forced him to experiment and to innovate, yielding both his aesthetic and his ethical insight. /T_hese very diculties\u2014\"the drama and/uni00A0... power of his attempt to work through our his-tory, to wrestle or rescue it into meaning\"\u2014are what make Faulkner so worthwhile. We read him because he takes us with him into our national heart of dark-ness, into the shameful history we have still failed to confront or understand. Our past, Gorra and Faulkner agree, is \"never over.\" Or certainly not yet.

By Merve EmreCulture & Critics \"To tolerate existence, we lie, and we lie above all to ourselves,\" Elena Ferrante observed in a 2002 inter-view. \"Falsehoods protect us, mitigate suering, allow us to avoid the terrifying moment of serious re/f_lection, they dilute the horrors of our time, they even save us from ourselves.\" For Ferrante, the falsehoods that peo-ple tell one another and themselves in everyday life\u2014I am happy; I love my wife; I didn 't what I was doing\u2014are \"lovely tales,\" or \"petty lies.\" At moments when guilt and shame threaten our conscience, when they shake our deepest beliefs about who we are, petty lies stop us from looking too closely at ourselves. Literary /f_iction is also a lie, according to Ferrante, but a lie that is \"made purposely to always tell the truth.\" /T_he lies that /f_iction tells\u2014once upon a time a person said and did this and that\u2014are unmotivated by self-interest. Fiction is an illusion that tinkers with our sense of reality to lay bare the price we pay for our petty lies: Fiction shows us that narcissism and self-doubt impel us to hurt others; that we are quick to betray people who trust us; that love can be more destructive than hate. Central to Ferrante's theory of /f_iction as an act of truth-telling is her conviction that the truth dawns more radiantly when glimpsed through the veil of /f_iction's lies. What can we learn about the conjunction of life and /f_iction from a work of /f_iction about lying? Fer-rante's exquisitely moody new novel, /T_he Lying Life of Adults, is about a teenager named Giovanna who learns that the grown-ups in her life have been lying to her. She also learns that the contents of their lies are less intriguing than their styles of lying\u2014 exaggeration, omission, justi/f_ication, obfuscation\u2014which vary in their skillfulness, and in the pleasure and pain they aord. All lie dierently from /T_he Lying Life of Adults itself, which invites us to evaluate lying not only as a moral problem, but also as an aesthetic challenge\u2014 to ask whether a lie can ever be elevated into an art form. We might ask this question of all of Ferrante's writ- ing. Her /f_iction teems with liars of every age, from the insecure children of her beloved Neapolitan quartet, to the anguished adults of her early novels, to Elena Ferrante herself, an authorial persona who claims that she resorts to lying to shield herself. Unlike the Neapolitan quartet, which spans more than half a century in the lives of two friends, /T_he Lying Life of Adults concerns itself with adolescence\u2014a time when deception and self-deception loom large, and grow-ing up means learning to catch oneself and others in the act of lying. Everything that entails\u2014ridding oneself of childish illusions, recognizing the hypoc-risy of adults, suering romantic disappointment\u2014 is standard fare for novels of adolescence. But for Fer-rante, whose novel bestows on familiar experiences an ardent, unreal shimmer, growing up also involves BOOKS 0920_CC_Emre_Ferrante [Print]_13878845.indd 83 7/10/2020 9:19:16 AM /eight.taboldstyle/three.taboldstyleSEPTEMBER 2020 /eight.taboldstyle/four.taboldstyleCulture & Critics learning how to cultivate a talent for deception that approaches a talent for writing /f_iction. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /q.sc/u.sc/a.sc/r.sc/t.sc/e.sc/t.sc began with intensity, in a violent, working-class neighborhood of Naples, but /T_he Lying Life of Adults opens amid the educated, auent, and peaceable. Giovanna's father is a teacher at a prestigious high school and an aspiring Marxist intellectual, \"an unfailingly courteous man\" whose love and admiration she desperately desires. Her mother teaches Greek and Latin and proofreads romance novels. Giovanna's best friends, pretty Angela and poetic Ida, are the daugh-ters of her parents' best friends, the wealthy Mariano and Costanza. All seem content in their bourgeois happiness\u2014 until the day Giovanna, then 12, over-hears a conversation between her mother and father. Giovanna recalls the conversation from an un speci/f_ied present: \"T wo years before leaving home my father said to my mother that I was very ugly.\" We have no reason to doubt her account. \"/T_hose words,\" she tells us, \"remained /f_ixed\" in her mind as a cruel judgment on her pubescent body and poor perfor-mance in school. But we soon discover that what her father actually said was worse: She was \"becoming like his sister,\" her estranged Aunt Vittoria, \"a child-hood bogeyman, a lean, demonic silhouette,\" whose vulgarity and cruelty her noble father has detested for as long as Giovanna can remember. Reversing the quartet's story of upward mobility, Giovanna descends from her home atop Naples's highest hill to the industrial neighborhood where Vittoria lives, determined to discover the truth of her aunt's estrangement. Her father begs her \"to put wax in [her] ears like Odysseus.\" But Giovanna lis-tens as Vittoria tells the agonizing story of her love for a married man named Enzo, their aair exposed by Giovanna's father, no longer a heroic man but a puritanical, petty bourgeois opportunist. Vittoria describes the sublime feeling of \"fucking,\" \"an adher-ence to pleasure so desperately herself shockingly aroused. \"Tell your father: Vittoria said that if I don't fuck the way she fucked with Enzo, it's pointless for me to live,\" her aunt demands. We know Vittoria's pronouncement is a lie, but Giovanna is too overwhelmed by the pleasure the lie elicits to see it. /T_he moralizing lies of her father and the eroticizing lies of her aunt loom before her like Scylla and Charybdis. To navigate between them safely, she must cultivate her own style of deception. /F.sc/o.sc/r.sc /F.sc/e.sc/r.sc/r.sc/a.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc, lies, like literature, cleave to dif- ferent genres, each with its own conventions of lan-guage. To her parents, Giovanna downplays her fasci-nation with Vittoria, clipping her descriptions of her visit. To Vittoria, whom she starts to see regularly, she begins \"almost inadvertently to invent\" things about her parents, though she restrains herself from being too \"novelistic.\" To Angela and Ida, she lies about Vittoria recklessly, almost giving her \"the capacity to /f_ly through night skies or invent magic potions.\" /T_he quartet allowed its narrator, a writer named Len\u00f9, to move among several dierent genres of storytelling: the fable, the romance, the realist novel. /T_he Lying Life of Adults makes the same imaginative experiment avail-able to readers. \"I'm not wise, but I read a lot of nov-els,\" Giovanna says of her education in lying. \"Instead of my own words, phrases from books come to mind.\" /T_he books she begins with are the epics her father loves to quote. /T_hen her lies start to toggle between fable and romance, with their enchanted objects (she imagines a bracelet Vittoria gives her as possessing magic) and fairy-tale archetypes (she casts Vittoria as an evil witch). Yet the more Giovanna lies, the more she /f_lexes her nascent powers of perception and narration. Her inner world, her imagination, grows critical, rebel-lious, and she starts to see the \"well-ordered world\" of her parents with unnerving clarity. She discovers that a more melodramatic con/f_iguration of lies (reminiscent of the quartet's later books) has corrupted her family's happiness. /T_here is which he justi/f_ies artlessly, in \"a frenzy to redeem himself by listing his grand reasons, his pain and suering.\" /T_here is her mother's improvi-sation of \"nostalgic little her estranged husband's goodness, honesty, and /f_idelity. Giovanna deems these lies \"oensive,\" and is as repelled by their self-serving sentimentality as she is, eventually, by Vittoria's romantic vulgarity. Part of learning how to lie, Ferrante suggests, is learning how to judge lies based on their aesthetic merits. As we grow up, some varieties of lying must be cast aside: We know too much to accommodate their obvious falsity, their clich\u00e9s, their failure to reconcile us to the intractable realities of life. What makes the adults seem so stunted is that none of them lies with elegance or verve, with imagination or originality. As non-novelists\u2014teachers of the classics, proofreaders of romance\u2014their lies bor-row tropes from the /f_iction they produce and consume: romantic idealization, passivity in the face of passion, a feeling of fatedness. Yet, as Giovanna soon realizes, the lies designed by their literary culture are too reductive to give meaning to her quest to understand her sudden alienation from her life. /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /l.sc/y.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /l.sc/i.sc/f.sc/e.sc /o.sc/f.sc /a.sc/d.sc/u.sc/l.sc/t.sc/s.sc is not an epic, a fable, or a romance like the novels Giovanna's mother proofreads. It is not a bildungsroman or K\u00fcnstlerroman in the way the quartet is. It is a novel of disillusionment, as the literary critic Georg Luk\u00e1cs once described the category: a novel that strips away its young protagonist's Ferrante's fiction teems with liars of all ages, from the insecure children of her Neapolitan quartet to the anguished adults of her early novels. 0920_CC_Emre_Ferrante [Print]_13878845.indd 84 7/10/2020 9:19:17 AM84 /eight.taboldstyle/five.taboldstylemajor social relationships to elevate her interiority to \"the status of a completely independent world.\" From its origins in Balzac's Lost Illusions and Flaubert's Sen- timental Education, the genre explores an individual's struggle to adapt private fantasies and illusions to an outer world hostile to them. /T_he word Ferrante uses to describe this feeling of discordance is estraneit\u00e0: \"extraneousness,\" \"noninvolvement,\" or, as Ann Goldstein beautifully translates it, \"estrangement.\" When Giovanna embraces her father, but draws no comfort from his familiar scent, she is overwhelmed by \"a sense of estrangement that provoked suering mixed incongruously with satisfaction\"\u2014suering from the rupture with her family, from the loss of a shared world; and satisfaction at how her distance allows her to see her parents and aunt anew, her outer gaze clari/f_ied by her inner state of homelessness. /T_he novel's second half shows how estrangement might allow Giovanna to approach, blindly, haltingly, more elevated forms of lying than what her parents have oered. /T_he catalyst is Roberto, a classic Fer-rante love interest. He is a brilliant scholar of religion, a Neapolitan boy who has found success as a young man in Milan but remains attached to his origins; he is engaged to an attractive, if insipid, girl from Vittoria's neighborhood. When she meets Roberto, Giovanna, now almost 15, tells him she is reading a book about \"the search for lost time,\" and he praises her intellect. She tells herself the lie that comes /f_lu-ently to all teenagers: \"Become his friend, only that, and show him that, somewhere inside me, unknown even to myself, I possess the qualities he needs.\" A pointedly Proustian story of fantasy and desire unfolds. Call this kind of lie the self-deception of infatu-ation. It rarely lasts, as Ferrante knows, but as long as it does, it allows Giovanna to live lies that only inten-sify the desire they seek to suppress. Around Roberto, Giovanna projects an aura of intellectual purity, com-passion, and wisdom, and strives to be as good as she believes him to be. His work is about \"compunction,\" which he describes to her not as moral scrupulousness, but as \"a needle that had to pull the thread through the scattered fragments of our existence.\" /T_hat he will let her down is inevitable\u2014 from the moment they meet, we know he will never live up to her illusions. But her infatuation allows her to discover that the compunction of which Roberto speaks is key to what some liars, like some novels, do. /T_hey create the appearance of a uni/f_ied self, smoothing the painful and unassimilable edges out of our histories; they oer a false sense of consolation, which we accept, eager not to look too hard at ourselves. /W.sc/h.sc/a.sc/t.sc /k.sc/i.sc/n.sc/d.sc /o.sc/f.sc /n.sc/o.sc/v.sc/e.sc/l.sc is best at transforming lying into an art form and /f_iction into a truthful lie rather than mere consolation? Not the epic, not the romance, and not the Proustian novel, which labors to create a single self out of the fragments of existence. /T_he answer can be found at the very beginning of /T_he Lying Life of Adults , when Giovanna describes the story to come. I slipped away, and am still slipping away, within these lines that are intended to give me a story, while in fact I am nothing, nothing of my own, nothing that has really begun or really been brought to com-pletion: only a tangled knot, and nobody, not even the one who at this moment is writing, knows if it contains the right thread for a story or is merely a snarled confusion of suering, without redemption. Everything the sentence suggests\u2014that the \"I\" who speaks from within /f_iction is elusive; that writing is like weaving a fabric that conceals and reveals the life beneath; that this fabric will never redeem life's suering\u2014is a description of Ferrante's own /f_iction. The novel alludes to the quartet as it closes, and Giovanna (the reader) and her poetic friend Ida (the writer) leave for Venice together, vowing to become \"adults as no one ever had before.\" On the one hand, the ending could be read ironically, as a version of the thrillingly clich\u00e9 adolescent illusion that running away from home will free us from the ties that bind. On the other, the embrace of friendship over family and romance could signal the beginning of a superior and entirely truthful lie: the writing of the novel itself, a col-laborative examination of the past by two people\u2014both Giovanna the liar and \"the one who at this moment is writing.\" Whether the one who is writing is the older Giovanna or her friend Ida, the echo of the intertwined protagonists of the quartet, Lila and Len\u00f9, is clear. /T_he end of /T_he Lying Life of Adults suggests that the way to reckon with the \"snarled confusion of suf-fering\" is literary partnership\u2014that this marvelously disconcerting novel of disillusionment is a product of the grace extended to the liar by the writer. Only the writer's truthful lies can mirror the liar's petty ones with the clear sight needed to arm the inten-sity of her past. Only the writer knows how to con-jure desire; sympathize with misjudgment; rebuke careless ness; disappoint mercifully. Always, Ferrante's /f_iction reminds us that sometimes you need someone else to help gather the scattered fragments of your existence. A writer is a friend who can /f_ind the thread of your story when you are too blinded by your lies to grasp it yourself. She can give you the beginning and end you need\u2014if not in life, then in /f_iction. Merve Emre is an associate English professor at the University of Oxford.

Nearby, frantic KGB o cers\u2014the Soviet advisers whom the Stasi had long referred to as \"the friends\"\u2014were barricaded inside their villa, burning papers. \"We destroyed everything,\" remembered one of those o cers, Vladimir Putin. \"All our com-munications, our lists of contacts and our agents' networks/uni00A0... We burned so much stu that the furnace burst.\" Toward evening, a group of protesters broke away from the Stasi building and started marching toward the KGB villa. Pan-icked, Putin called the Soviet military command in Dresden and asked for reinforcements. None were forthcoming. \"I got the feeling then that the country no longer existed. /T_h at it had dis-appeared,\" Putin told an interviewer years later. \"It was clear the union was ailing. And it had a terminal disease without a cure\u2014a paralysis of power.\" /T_h e shock was total, and he never forgot it. For hundreds of millions of people, the fall of the Berlin Wall was a great triumph: The moment marked the end of hated dictator ships and the beginning of a better era. But for the KGB o cers stationed in Dresden, the political revolutions of 1989 marked the end of their empire and the beginning of an era of humiliation. In interviews, Putin has returned to that moment\u2014 the moment when reinforcements did not come\u2014always describ-ing it as a turning point in his own life. Like Scarlett O'Hara shak-ing her /f_i st at a blood-red sky, Putin swore, it seems, to dedicate his life to restoring his country's glory. But Putin's cinematic depiction of his last days in Dresden cap- tures only part of what happened. As Catherine Belton demon-strates in Putin's People, large chunks are missing from his story and from the stories of his KGB colleagues\u2014the other members of what would become, two decades later, Russia's ruling class. As the title indicates, Belton's book is not a biography of the Russian dictator, but a portrait of this generation of security agents. And many of them were not, in fact, entirely shocked by the events of 1989. On the contrary, some of them had been preparing already. In August 1988, a high-ranking o cial from Moscow arrived in East Berlin and began recruiting German sleeper agents, who continued to work with the KGB, or rather the institutions that replaced the KGB, even after the reuni/f_i cation of Germany and the fall of the Soviet Union itself. At about the same time, the KGB was also setting up the o shore accounts, fake businesses, and hidden \"black cash\" funds that would, in the 1990s, propel some of its members to great wealth and power. From 1986 to 1988, for example, the Stasi transferred millions of marks to a network of companies in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Singapore, all run by an Austrian businessman named Martin Schla . He and his companies would reemerge years later, Belton writes, as \"central cogs in the uence operations of the Putin regime.\" /T_h e KGB's Dresden team may have also played another role in the organization's careful preparations for a post-Communist future. Precisely because the city was a backwater\u2014and thus uninteresting to other intelligence agencies\u2014the KGB and the Stasi orga-nized meetings in Dresden with some of the extremist organizations they supported in the West and around the world. One former member of the Red Army Faction\u2014 the West German terrorist organization, also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, that killed dozens of people during its heyday\u2014told Belton that one of its most notorious /f_i nal actions was planned with the help of the KGB and the Stasi in Dresden. In late November 1989, Alfred Herrhausen, the chairman of Deutsche Bank, died after a bomb hit his car. Herr-hausen was, at that time, a close adviser to the German government on the economics of reuni/f_i cation, and a proponent of a more integrated European economy. Why him? Perhaps the KGB had its own ideas about how reuni/f_i cation should proceed and how the Euro-pean economy should be integrated. Perhaps Russia's secret policemen didn't want any rivals messing things up. Or perhaps they wanted, as their successors still do, to create havoc in Germany and beyond. Belton does not prove Putin's personal involve- ment in any of these projects, which isn't surprising. /T_h e Russian leader has gone to great lengths to conceal his real role during the four and a half years he spent in Dresden. But throughout her book, which will surely now become the de/f_i nitive account of the rise of Putin and Putinism, she adds enough new details to establish beyond doubt that the future Russian president was working alongside the people who set up the secret bank accounts and held the meetings with subversives and terrorists. More important, she establishes how, years later, these kinds of projects came to bene/f_i t him and shape his worldview. Building on the work of others\u2014Masha Gessen's /T_h e Man & Critics Belton documents the activities of the biznesmeny who have circled around Trump for 30 years, bailing him out, offering him \"deals.\" Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin, Karen Dawisha's Putin's Kleptocracy: Owns Russia?, Steven Lee Myers's /T_he Tsar: /T_he Rise and Reign of , and Fiona Hill and Cliord Gaddy's Mr./uni00A0Putin: Operative in the Kremlin , among many books on this subject\u2014 Belton, a former Financial Times correspondent in Mos- cow, incorporates crucial new material from interviews with former KGB operatives, Kremlin insiders, and bankers in various countries. She shows that Putin may have been burning documents in Dresden, but he never lost touch with the people, the tactics, or the operations launched by the KGB at that time. /S.sc/t.sc/e.sc/p.sc /b.sc/y.sc /s.sc/t.sc/e.sc/p.sc, Belton demonstrates how the future president made full use of KGB methods, contacts, and networks at each stage of his career. She describes the famous swindle he ran in St./uni00A0Petersburg in the '90s, selling oil abroad on the city's behalf, suppos-edly to buy food for its inhabitants; instead the pro/f_its went to create a hard-currency slush fund\u2014known in Russian criminal slang as an obschak\u2014much of which /f_inanced other operations and eventually enriched Putin's friends. Later, Putin won the con/f_idence of the Russian oligarchs of President Boris Yeltsin's era, in part by promising them immunity from prosecution after Yeltsin resigned; once he took power, he eliminated them from the game, arresting some throughout the early 2000s and chasing others out of the country. In the years that he has been president, his cronies have launched a series of major operations\u2014the Deutsche Bank \"mirror trading\" scheme, the Moldovan \"laun-dromat,\" the Danske Bank scandal\u2014all of which used Western banks to help move stolen money out of Rus-sia. Similar schemes continue to the present day. But the pivotal political event for Putin took place in 2005, when a pro-Western president, Viktor Yush-chenko, came to power in Ukraine after a street revo-lution. /T_he Russian president blamed these events on American money and the CIA (an organization that, for better or worse, never had anything like that kind of in/f_luence in Ukraine). \"It was the worst nightmare of Putin's KGB men that, inspired by events in neigh-boring countries, Russian oppositionists funded by the West would seek to topple Putin's regime too,\" Belton writes. \"/T_his was the dark paranoia that col-ored and drove many of the actions they were to take from then on.\" Not coincidentally, this scenario\u2014 pro-Western-democracy protesters overthrowing a corrupt and unpopular regime\u2014was precisely the one that Putin had lived through in Dresden. Putin was so upset by events in Kyiv that he even considered resigning, Belton reports. Instead, he decided to stay on and /f_ight back, using the only methods he knew. Although the American electorate awoke to the reali ty of Russian in/f_luence operations only in 2016, they had begun more than a decade earlier, after that /f_irst power change in Ukraine. Already in 2005, two of Putin's closest colleagues, the oligarchs Vladimir Yakunin and Konstantin Malofeyev, had begun setting up the organizations that would promote an \"alterna-tive\" to democracy and integration all across Europe. With the help of intermediaries and friendly compa-nies, and more recently with the assistance of troll farms and online disinformation operations, they promoted a whole network of think tanks and fake \"experts.\" Some-times they aided existing political parties\u2014the National Front in France, for example, and the Northern League in Italy\u2014and sometimes they helped create new ones, such as the far-right Alternative for Germany. /T_he most important funder of the British Brexit campaign had odd Russian contacts. So did some cabinet ministers in Poland's supposedly anti-Russian, hard-right gov-ernment, elected after a campaign marked by online disinformation in 2015. The pro-Russian \"separatists\" who would later launch a war in eastern Ukraine got their start around 2005 too, with an even more apocalyptic result. Rus-sian propaganda deliberately sought to divide Ukraine and polarize its citizens, while Russian corruption reached deep into the economy. Within a decade, the Russian operations in Ukraine led to mass violence. Some of the Ukrainians who attended Kremlin youth camps or joined the Eurasian Youth movement during the 2000s\u2014often funded by the \"charities\" created by Malofeyev, Yakunin, and others\u2014 took part in the storming of Donetsk's city-administration buildings in 2014, and then in the horri/f_ic Russian-Ukrainian war, which has disrupted European politics and claimed more than 13,000 lives. Russian soldiers, weapons, and advisers fuel the /f_ighting in eastern Ukraine even now. All of these Russian-backed groups, from re/f_ined Dutch far-right politicians in elegant suits to the Donetsk thugs, share a common dislike for the Euro-pean Union, for NATO, for any united concept of \"the West,\" and in many cases for democracy itself. In a very deep sense, they are Putin's ideological answer to the trauma he experienced in 1989. Instead of democ-racy, autocracy; instead of unity, division; instead of open societies, xenophobia. Amazingly, quite a few people, even some American conservatives, are taken in by Russian tactics. It is incredible, but a group of cynical, corrupt ex-KGB ocers with access to vast quantities of illegal money\u2014operating in a country with religious discrimination, extremely low church attendance, and a large Muslim minority\u2014have somehow made themselves into the world's biggest promoters of \"Christian values,\" opposing feminism, gay rights, and laws against domestic violence, and supporting \"white\" identity politics. /T_his is an old geopolitical struggle disguised as a new culture war.

Nikky Finney's 2011 collection, Head Off & Split , was the winner of the National Book Award for poetry. This poem appears in her new book, Love Child's Hotbed of Occasional Poetry: Poems and Artifacts , published this spring by Northwestern University Press.Yakunin himself told Belton, frankly, that \"this battle is used by Russia to restore its global position.\" Ultimately, all of these tactics had their culmination in the career of Donald T rump. In the last chapter of Putin's People, Belton documents the activities of the biznesmeny who have circled around T rump for 30 years, bailing him out, buying apartments in his build-ings for cash, oering him \"deals,\" always operating in \"the half-light between the Russian security services and the mob, with both sides using the other to their own bene/f_it.\" Among them are Shalva Tchigirinsky, a Georgian black marketeer who met T rump in Atlantic City in 1990; Felix Sater, a Russian with mob links whose company served, among other things, as the intermediary for T rump buildings in Manhattan, Fort Lauderdale, and Phoenix; Alex Shnaider, a Russian met-als trader who developed the T rump hotel in Toronto; and Dmitry Rybolovlev, an oligarch who purchased T rump's Palm Beach mansion in 2008 for $95/uni00A0mil-lion, more than double what T rump had paid for it in 2004, just as the /f_inancial crisis hit T rump's companies. While many of these stories have been written before, Belton puts them in the larger context. /T_he hard truth is that T rump was not exceptional. He was just another amoral Western businessman, one of many whom the ex-KGB elite have promoted and sponsored around the world, with the hope that they might eventu ally be of some political or commercial use. Many of these bets didn't pay o, but in 2016, Putin /f_inally hit the jackpot: His operatives helped elect an Ameri-can president with long-standing Russian links who would not only sow chaos, but systematically under-mine America's alliances, erode American in/f_luence, and even, in the spring of 2020, render the American federal government dysfunctional, damaging the reputation of both the U.S. and democracy more broadly. A huge success for Putin's people has proved a ter- rible tragedy for the rest of the world\u2014a tragedy that also touches ordinary Russians. In her epilogue, Bel-ton notes that in seeking to restore their country's sig-ni/f_icance, Putin's KGB cronies have repeated many of the mistakes their Soviet predecessors made at home. /T_hey have once again created a calci/f_ied, authoritarian political system in Russia, and a corrupt economy that discourages innovation and entrepreneurship. Instead of experiencing the prosperity and political dynamism that still seemed possible in the '90s, Russia is once again impoverished and apathetic.

Jones has published to great acclaim and experienced unspeakable tragedy. Now she is releasing her first novel in more than 20 years. By Calvin BakerIn the winter of 1975, a quiet young woman from Lexington, Kentucky, met her Ph.D. adviser in Brown University's writing program for a series of unsatisfactory tutorials about an ambitious project of hers that had yet to fully reveal itself. /T_h e encounters were strange enough that her adviser still recalled them in an interview a quarter century later: \"I was doing all the talking, and she would sit rigidly, just bobbing her 0920_BoB_Baker_GaylJones [Print]_13891852.indd PM /nine.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyleSEPTEMBER 2020 /nine.taboldstyle/two.taboldstylehead in a regal manner. Yet there was a kind of arrogance to her. Perhaps it was the arrogance of an artist fiercely committed to a vision, but I also sensed a bottled-up black rage.\" /T_here's nothing unusual about a young writer seething at the world, especially in the 1970s, when protests and bad attitudes about race, war, and university curricula were so de/uni00A0rigueur that they may as well have been taught at orientation. Likelier than not, his student sensed her (white) adviser's judgment and withdrew in response\u2014and didn't think he had much to offer, anyway. While her natural range was virtuosic, his work consisted primarily of a host of popular paperbacks and magazine stories whose titles, including Dormitory Women and \"Up the Down Coed,\" accurately convey their subjects and sensibilities. However mutually frustrating the meetings between Gayl Jones and R./uni00A0V./uni00A0Cassill may have been, his com-ment is most striking for having been made to The New York Times after her husband, Robert Higgins, slit his own throat when a SWAT team stormed their house in February/uni00A01998 to arrest him on a 14-year-old warrant from another state. T wo decades earlier, Jones had been hailed as one of the great literary phenoms of the 20th century, only to then drop out of sight; just days before her husband killed himself, she'd reemerged on the American literary scene with a new novel that would become a /f_inalist for a National Book Award. Leaving aside the callous- ness of Cassill's remarks (and the obvious question: What does \"black rage\" mean?), they violated the typical assumptions of academic privacy. /T_hat the reporter and his editors deemed Cassill's observation useful in understanding Jones's life does not confirm her anger so much as it arms all there is to be angry about. No matter her insights and achievements, the frame through which she was viewed and understood by the white world remained the same. She sat silently as he read the early drafts of what would become her /f_irst novel. He talked. She left. He was /f_lum-moxed. She returned, because she had to. It could have been a Beckett play, almost funny until you lived it. Fortunately, Jones also worked closely at Brown with a true mentor, the noted poet Michael Harper, who'd overseen her master's degree and would become a life-long friend. She received her doctorate in 1975 and published her /f_irst novel, Cor- regidora, the same year. /T_he story is told by a 1940s Kentucky blues singer, Ursa, whose troubles with men are refracted through memories of slavery handed down by her matrilineal line: My great-grandmama told my grand- mama the part she lived through that my grandmama didn't live through and my grandmama told my mama what they both lived through and my mama told me what they all lived through and we were suppose to pass it down like that from generation to generation so we don't forget. Or, as the protagonist, whose mother and grandmother were fathered by the same Portuguese slave owner, says at another point: \"I am Ursa Corregidora. I have tears for eyes. I was made to touch my past at an early age. I found it on my mother's tiddies. In her milk.\" What Faulkner saw in the haunted old mansions of Oxford, Mississippi, Jones saw in the ghosts of the Black dead. She was a pioneer in grappling with the contemporary legacy of slavery, and her debut was praised by the likes of John Updike, in /T_he New Yorker, as well as a host of Black writers. \"Corregi-dora is the most brutally honest and pain- ful revelation of what has occurred, and is occurring, in the souls of Black men and women,\" James Baldwin wrote. Jones's early novels were shepherded by Toni Morrison, then an editor at Random House, who'd dedicated herself to pub-lishing Black writers, especially women. To put things in perspective, at the time Corregidora came out, Morrison had only recently published her /f_irst works of /f_ic-tion, /T_he Bluest Eye and Sula. She had yet to hit her stride as a writer, while Jones burst forth in her early 20s all but fully formed and requiring little editing. Jones needed a champion, however, someone who could understand and appreciate the sophistica-tion of her approach to subject matter as well as language. \"No novel about any black woman could ever be the same after this,\" Morrison declared after reading the manu-script of Corregidora . Richard Ford, who got to know Jones when they were both fellows at the Uni-versity of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, called her a \"prodigy\": \"History may have caught up with her, but she was a movement unto herself. Toni knew this very, very, very well when she published her.\" Jones had a marked eect not only on Morrison's subsequent novels but on an entire generation of writers, whether they realized it or not. /T_he tentacles of slavery in the present day have grown into a principal concern of Black literature, and Jones's early work was absorbed into this canon almost imperceptibly. Over time, her literary ambi-tions would evolve, as she published and then receded from the public eye, pub-lished and then receded. /T_his spring, she self-published her /f_irst novel in 21 years\u2014Palmares, a six-volume work about the last fugitive-slave settlement in Brazil. In mid-June, Beacon Press bought the rights to the book, with plans to release it in the fall. In the sprawling narrative, set in the 17th cen-tury, Jones's feats of linguistic and historical invention are on ample display. Describ-ing the impact of her singular vision and intensity, John Edgar Wideman remarked 22 years ago: \"I think she scared people.\" /G.sc/a.sc/y.sc/l.sc /J.sc/o.sc/n.sc/e.sc/s.sc was born into a modest fam- ily in 1949. Her father, Franklin, worked as a line cook in a restaurant, an occupation she would later give to the father of the narrator of her second novel, Eva's Man . Her mother, Lucille, was a homemaker and a writer; Jones would incorporate lengthy passages from her work into her experimen-tal fourth novel, Mosquito. Jones spent childhood weekends visit- ing her maternal grandmother on a small farm outside Lexington, where she absorbed the stories of the adults around her. It is an unremarkable detail, save for the impor-tance and seriousness Jones later ascribed to this time, as an educated woman chan-neling those locked out of institutions of BEACON 0920_BoB_Baker_GaylJones [Print]_13891852.indd 92 7/13/2020 3:38:11 PM92 /nine.taboldstyle/three.taboldstyleso-called higher learning, as a daughter in communion with her mothers, as a formi-dable theorist validating the integrity and equality of oral modes of storytelling. \"/T_he best of my writing comes from having heard rather than having read,\" Jones told Michael Harper in an intimate interview conducted the year Corregidora was published. She has- tened to add that she wasn't dismissing the glories of reading, only pointing out that \"in the beginning, all of the richness came from people rather than books because in those days you were reading some really un fortunate kinds of books in school.\" In the mid-1960s, when Gayl and her younger brother were teenagers, Lucille managed to enroll them in the segre-gated but academically well-regarded Henry Clay High School. (/T_he public-school system in Lexington did not for-mally integrate until the mid-1970s, 20 years after Brown v. Board of Education .) Jones proved an extraordinary student, and through the eorts of her Spanish teacher she was introduced to the poet Elizabeth Hardwick, who, together with her sometimes husband, Robert Lowell, helped arrange a scholarship for Jones at Connecticut College. She proved an equally exceptional student in New Eng-land, devoting herself to literature. /J.sc/o.sc/n.sc/e.sc/s.sc /p.sc/u.sc/b.sc/l.sc/i.sc/s.sc/h.sc/e.sc/d.sc Eva's Man in 1976, a year after Corregidora . Like Ursa, Eva is a 40ish woman recounting her life story, in this case from prison. Eva landed there after murdering and castrating in graphic fashion a lover she'd spent a few days with\u2014ostensibly because she'd learned he was married. In conversations with a fel-low inmate and a prison psychiatrist, Eva \"stitch[es] her memories and fantasies into a pattern of sexual and emotional abuse,\" as the critic Margo Jeerson wrote. When the psychiatrist asks Eva if she can pin-point what triggered her to kill the man, she replies only, \"It was his whole way.\" Jones called Corregidora a \"blues novel,\" because it communicated the \"simultane-ity of good and bad, as feeling, as some-thing felt,\" she told Harper. Meanwhile, she considered her second novel a \"hor-ror story,\" explaining in another inter-view\u2014with Charles H. Rowell, the editor of Callaloo, an African American literary magazine\u2014 that what Eva \"does to the man in the book is a 'horror'/uni00A0... Eva carries out what Ursa might have done but didn't.\" Published back-to-back, the books form a diptych exploring the under-currents of the psyche in a world of slave-owners, whoremongers, prostitutes, killers, man-eaters, jealous husbands, wayward wives, psych-ward inmates, pedophiles, wife-beaters, women in love with their abusers, and girls who carry knives. Nobody goes to church much. Instead of sermons, sense and suste- nance /f_low from a web of intimacy and memory, at least for Jones's female charac-ters. /T_he men are mostly phalluses tumes-cent with bad news. /T_heir collective role is as a source of fear and pain, but also desire. Love is not absent, but the word can't cap-ture what transpires between her women and men. Jones has often been read as a political warrior speaking for unvoiced Black women, but she's too great a writer with too broad a mind\u2014and too mesmer-ized by psychological complexity\u2014 to pass any ideological purity tests. As she told Rowell, her preoccupations were \"contra-dictory character and ambivalent charac-ter, and I like to explore them even with-out judgments entering the work.\" Jones's politics are inscribed in her choice to write about the lowborn and low-down, giving them as much intelligence as she possesses; to work in /f_lawless Black Eng-lish; and to position herself inside rather than outside her characters. /T_he vantage stands in contrast to the approach of Zora Neale Hurston, for example, whom Jones admired for her up-close treatment of rela-tionships between Black men and women, but who at points wrote on behalf of Janie, in /T_heir Eyes Were Watching God, not as her. As Jones well understood, Hurston, like all writers, was a product of her time, and of the circumstances of her oppression. She and her fellow members of the Harlem Renaissance were self-consciously striv-ing to create a literature of Black people's expanding worlds beyond slavery, but the mission could devolve into representing Blacks for a white audience, giving their /f_ic-tions an unintended stiltedness. /T_he prob-lem might be summarized as one of code-switching between the Black world and the white gaze. /T_he Black writer who knows the codes of both must always explain the lives, decisions, and humanity of her Black charac ters to whites who might not oth-erwise credit them. In Jones's storytelling, however, there was no \" 'author' getting in the way,\" Morrison noticed. /T_he other Black inventors of the mod- ern novel about slavery were Leon Forrest (Two Wings to Veil My Face), who wrote with lyrical, epicurean elegance, and Charles Johnson (Oxherding T ale ), whose stories of slave escapes are entwined with the Buddhist quest to get o the wheel of suering, as well as with the ontological questions of Western philosophy. They bring the high-minded into the lives of the low. By working the other way around, Jones challenges literature itself to embrace other registers of the language, includ-ing the obscene, as in this relatively mild example from Corregidora : A Portuguese seaman turned planta- tion owner, he took her out of the /f_ield when she was still a child and put her to work in his whorehouse while she was a child/uni00A0... I stole [the picture of him] because I said whenever afterward when evil come I wanted something to point to and say, \"/T_hat's what evil look like.\" You know what I mean? Yeah, he did more fucking than the other mens did. Telling stories out loud was a matter of survival\u2014 and the way Jones wields this tradition transforms even a nursery rhyme into something dirty, dangerous, and important. 0920_BoB_Baker_GaylJones [Print]_13891852.indd 93 7/13/2020 3:38:11 PM /nine.taboldstyle/three.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyle/four.taboldstyle ILLUSTRATION BY NA KIMJones elaborated on the politics of the English language with Harper: I usually trust writers who I feel I can hear.

Of course, black writers\u2014 it goes without saying why we've always had to hear. Telling stories out loud was a matter of survival and wholeness for a community forbidden to read, as well as an act of rebel-lion, and the way Jones wields this tradition transforms even a kind of nursery rhyme 0920_BoB_Baker_GaylJones [Print]_13891852.indd 94 7/13/2020 3:38:13 PM94 /nine.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyle SEPTEMBER 2020shared between daughter and mother into something dirty, dangerous, and important.

Don't come here to my house, don't come here to my house I said/uni00A0... Fore you get any this booty, you gon have to lay down dead. When Harper asked for her thoughts on the architects of 20th-century Black lit- erature, namely \"Gaines, Toomer, Ellison, Hurston, Walker, Forrest, Wright, Hughes, Brown, Hayden et./uni00A0al,\" Jones pointed out the wide variation in a group that to the mainstream might appear homogeneous: You know, I say the names over in my mind, and I think about those people who will speak of black writing as a \"lim-ited category,\" the implication being that it's something you have to transcend. And it surprised me because I thought critics had outgrown that sort of posture. She certainly had. Whereas Baldwin famously lashed out at the protest-novel straitjacket put on mid-20th- century Black writers\u2014\"The 'protest' novel, so far from being disturbing, is an accepted and comforting aspect of the American scene\"\u2014Jones came of age breathing the air of the Black Arts Movement. Founded by LeRoi Jones (no relation), who com-bined immense talent, critical acumen, and, after being brutalized by the police, a rusty shank of disdain for the lassitude of white America, the movement advanced the idea that white people's approval was beside the point. Why bother being the Black excep-tion in a country where attempts to control the mind and body of Black people knew no bounds? In his /f_iery 1965 manifesto, \"/T_he Revolutionary /T_heatre,\" LeRoi Jones described the mission for Black artists this way: \"White men will cower before this theatre because it hates them/uni00A0... /T_he Rev-olutionary /T_heatre must hate them for hat-ing.\" Gayl Jones's \"fuck o \" was less explicit but no less radical: She wrote /f_iction as if white people weren't watching.Eva embodies that position. In a conver- sation about Jones's second book published last year in The Believer, the young Zambian- born novelist Namwali Ser-pell explained the \"brilliance\" of Jones's choice to let Eva be \"bad,\" to seemingly lack or reject the reflex to see herself through white people's eyes. Eva's \"un-self- consciousness,\" her unwillingness to \"be known, or know how others know her,\" Serpell said, \"is a kind of freedom.\" /M.sc/o.sc/r.sc/e.sc /t.sc/h.sc/a.sc/n.sc a few readers of Jones have assumed that her volatile husband inspired Eva's Man , but she didn't meet him until several years after she wrote that book, in Ann Arbor. In other words, she wasn't the naive Black girl writing autobiographical workshop /f_iction, an expectation Jones was accustomed to. \"Always with black writers,\" she told Rowell, \"there's the sus-picion that they can't/uni00A0... invent a linguistic world in the same way that other writers can.\" A white professor, in fact, once told Jones that he was surprised that she didn't talk more like Ursa. Ford, who recalls Jones as \"within her- self, but friendly and very smart,\" says it's a mistake to conflate authors with their characters. \"Gayl's books were dramatic, sexual, sexually violent, eloquent, and harsh in their assessments of the life she was viv-idly portraying,\" he told me. \"But /f_iction is not simply an emotional 'readout' of a writer's feelings. It's a congeries of made-up, ill-/f_itting, heretofore unaliated shards of experience, memory, feeling, event.\" Not much is known about Robert Hig- gins, apart from the dramatic run-ins he had with the law, including a pivotal one in 1983, when the pair attended a local gay-rights rally. /T_here, he was alleged to have proclaimed himself God and declared HIV a form of divine retribution, prompt-ing a woman to punch him. Whatever actually happened, Higgins, being an American, went home and returned bran-dishing a gun. He was arrested by the Ann Arbor police; his assailant was not. Rather than appear in court to defend himself, he and Jones left town, with a letter of protest to the university (and to President Ronald Reagan) that said, in part: \"I reject your lying, racist shit. Do whatever you want. God is with Bob, and I'm with him.\" /T_he couple then decamped from the United States altogether and spent the next /f_ive years in Europe, mostly in Paris, joining the tail end of a Black expatriate scene made up of people who did not wish to return to America after World War/uni00A0II. Around this time, Jones published three books of poetry. /T_he best-known of these, Song for Anninho , shares the essential story of Palmares, the epic novel she began com- posing more than four decades ago. It's a love story about a man and a woman who live there (and, incidentally, was dedi-cated to Higgins). In this faraway past in a world populated by Africans, American Indians, Europeans, and all their possible admixtures, Jones pursued her desire to link Black Americans' struggle to that of colonized people across the globe\u2014the goal of what's known as the universal free-dom movement. \"I'd like to be able to/uni00A0...write imaginatively of blacks anywhere/everywhere,\" she told Rowell. She was a passionate student of Latin American liter-ature, and her poetry has the lushness\u2014and at times the over-the-top romanticism\u2014 through memory/uni00A0... the blood of the whole continent/uni00A0/ running in my veins.\" In the late 1980s, Jones and Higgins returned to America, moving to Lexington to live with Jones's mother, who was ill. Meanwhile, the rights to Corregidora and Eva's Man had been acquired by the old Boston publisher Beacon. In 1997, how-ever, Jones asked her editor there, Helene Atwan, to remove them from print. \"She said they portrayed Black men very nega-tively, and she didn't want those to be her only books out there,\" Atwan told me, admitting to being intimidated by her author's brilliance. \"I said, 'No! /T_hey're important books. Send us new books, and we'll publish those.' \" Jones promptly forwarded the manu- script for /T_he Healing, the story of an itin- erant faith healer, a woman named Harlan who is one step ahead of hard times and of her own past. In a 1991 book of critical essays, called Liberating Voices , Jones had described the trajectory of Black litera-ture as moving from \"the restrictive forms (inheritors of self-doubt, self-repudiation, and the 95 7/13/2020 3:38:13 PM /nine.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyleSEPTEMBER 2020 /nine.taboldstyle/six.taboldstyleof voice and freer personalities in more intricate texts,\" and /T_he Healing puts the author herself on that path. /T_he narrative voice is that of a world-weary, often wry country preacher with a self- proclaimed ability to cure the sick and soul-wounded. As Harlan encounters believers and non-believers during her travels, Jones plants notions about how narratives are deployed in everyday life to both reveal and hide. /T_he story's small \"tank towns\" and ordinary people are familiar from her other books, but where the earlier work seems to resign itself to the world, /T_he Healing holds forth the possibility of redemption. /T_he speed with which Jones presented the manuscript to Beacon suggests that it was a novel she had written earlier, and only then decided to publish. When it was named as a /f_inalist for a 1998 National Book Award, Jones asked Michael Harper to attend in her place, eschewing industry hobnobbing for a private life in Kentucky. /T_his privacy was soon upended, after the Lexington police saw a celebratory article about her in Newsweek and, armed with the old warrant from Michigan, went to arrest Higgins, then living under the alias Bob Jones. When they arrived at the couple's door, he threatened suicide rather than sur-render. /T_he police then called for a SWAT team. Higgins signaled his serious ness by taking up a kitchen knife. /T_hey stormed inside anyway, tackling Jones as Higgins did what he said he'd do. A district attorney defended the police's \"perfectly\" executed handling of the warrant, noting that Hig-gins had written threatening letters about the shoddy hospital care his mother-in-law received, and that by the time the authori-ties arrived they were \"sitting on a bomb.\" After her husband's death, Jones was committed to a hospital amid fears that she might harm herself. When her fourth novel, Mosquito, appeared the following year, everyone /f_locked to it for clues about the tragedy. Instead, they were greeted with a wildly ambitious novel that took its inspiration from the free-form ris of jazz, in line with Black writers like Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray. Jazz is many things, and Mosquito came from its more daring vein. It was not well received. In a pan of the book published in /T_he New York Times, Henry Louis Gates/uni00A0Jr. com-plained that it often reads more like Jones's \"/T_heory of the Novel,\" her encyclopedic version of Jamesian prefaces, than like any of Jones's previous works. It's a late-night ri by the Signifying Monkey, drunk with words and out of control, regur-gitating half-digested ideas taken from USA Today, digressing on every possible subject, from the color of the Egyptians to the xenophobia of the Great Books movement, from the art of \"signifying\" and the role of Africans in the slave trade to the subtleties of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. Clearly Gates likes to play the dozens. /T_he book demands to be taken more seriously. On the simple level of story, it's about a truck driver named Mosquito\u2014the only female on a route that traces the Mexi-can border\u2014who becomes a coyote for a group called the Sanctuary, ferrying refu-gees on the \"new Underground Railroad.\" All of Jones's women are on the run, but from book to book they become more likely to have a place to go. Mosquito is one of Jones's trademark mash-ups\u2014 fusing her interests in history, charac ter, and con-temporary events. Time is collapsed, such that the past, present, and future play on a Finnegan's Wake-style loop of language and consciousness. It's an Olympian move, but if you're Simone Biles, who's to tell you not to play hopscotch with the gods? Like other late-postmodern works, the book over/f_lows the usual frames of realism; it includes the author's original theories about the relation-ship between story and life, between the speaker/writer and the listener/reader. It often sounds like overhearing a lunch date between Derrida and Calvino, at a table where both theorist and master are Jones. Mosquito didn't /f_ind a general readership, but it helped feed a lot of dissertations. Its reception aside, the novel marked a formal shift for Jones. The wealth of knowledge inside the author's mind by then\u2014the ideas, and the layers of experi-ence she was trying to put across\u2014strain the naive /f_irst-person narrator. Jones may have been listening to jazz, but she was also exploring the boundaries of what is pos-sible in the modernist forms of the novel. At 50, an age when many writers are just arriving at the height of their power, Jones might have been expected to tally the lessons from her experiment and keep moving. Indeed, Atwan said that Mosquito wasn't yet published when Jones sent her the manuscript for Palmares. But for rea- sons unavailable to us, Jones\u2014who com-municated only sporadically with her Bea-con editor\u2014 decided against following through with the book. And soon, Atwan said, Jones told her that she'd stopped writing entirely. /A.sc /m.sc/a.sc/i.sc/n.sc /d.sc/e.sc/f.sc/i.sc/n.sc/i.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc of a canonical artist is one whom other artists keep alive across generations. And word of mouth is what led me to Jones's work a few years after college, when I decided to truly educate myself. As an aspiring novelist, I wanted to see where my own writing /f_it in, sure, but I'd also matured enough to realize that what I liked and didn't like was irrele-vant to the task of understanding the vast-ness of literature.

I read the Nobel Prize winners I hadn't before. Harold Bloom was the GOAT among readers, so I measured myself in those days against the indexes of /T_he Western Canon. You can read all of these things and still not know much about Black literature. My educa-tion there was in bookshops and libraries, but especially in talking with other writers, visual artists, musicians, /f_ilmmakers, danc-ers. It was the best education I ever had. One Friday after work at my day job as a magazine writer, I made my way from Sixth Avenue to a bar in Hell's Kitchen where industry people gathered. I joined some friends from Newsweek at the Black table, where they were sitting in stunned silence and self-reproach. Higgins had just killed himself, after the magazine outed his location. I don't remember the speci/f_ics, but we talked bitterly about the editorial decisions that led the police to his door. About the things that white Americans understood and did not understand about being Black in this country. /T_hings they might not wish to know. /T_he reason I've told you all this is so you'll understand what I mean when I say that Gayl Jones's new work is as rel-evant as ever. With monumental sweep, it blends psychological acuity and linguistic invention in a way that only a handful of writers in the trans atlantic tradition have matched. She has boldly set out to con-vey racial struggle in its deep-seated and disorienting complexity\u2014Jones sees the whole where most only see pieces. More than a third of all Africans removed from their homeland from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s\u2014more than 4/uni00A0million people\u2014were transported to Brazil and enslaved alongside the indig-enous people, at least those who hadn't been exterminated. Today Nigeria is the only country with a larger Black popu-lation than Brazil, and in the body of African American culture stretching from Harlem to Rio, the state of Bahia might be fairly viewed as its spiritual heart. Per-haps the heart of the entire Black world. Palmares centers on the reenslavement of the last settlement of free Blacks in Brazil\u2014 and is told from the point of view of Almeyda, a young girl who has learned to read with the help of a local Catholic priest named Father Tollinare, though he tries to limit the books available to her. /T_he novel has a Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquezean pace, and, because it imitates the rhythms of Portuguese and imports words without the usual linguistic signposts, it almost feels as though it has been translated into English. But where Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez writes of generals and doctors, Jones tells of slaves and whores. /T_he rhetoric of race in Latin America is dierent from our own, of course, but its history, and the ways blood and money operate, are familiar. Plot is beside the point in Palmares\u2014 the book unfolds on a plane of con-sciousness where the things achieved are shifting relation ships and states of being. Ultimately, the book is about taking full possession of the entire Black experience, including tenderness\u2014 and Jones's quest to free the individual Black voice. Father Tollinare, born back in the Old World and wedded to its old sounds, doesn't realize his young student's hunger to expand and integrate: During the studies, he'd pass one worn Bible around and we'd read the sto-ries, and he'd shake his head when we dropped letters o the ends of words, and he'd say, \"In Portugal they say it this way.\" \"But here we say it this way,\" I protested once. He looked at me sternly/uni00A0... I was silent because I wanted to know how to read and write the words, even if I continued to pro-nounce them a dierent way. At her best, Jones wields the words of a larger literary tradition with a subversive power that is rare in its all- encompassing purity. Dropping letters, she adds new worlds to that tradition, one that has been\u2014in this country, and in the Ameri-can language\u2014 as versed in duplicity as in revelation. One wishes that the blooming of Jones's genius were as simple as the say-ing \"You can't keep a good woman down.\" /T_he truth is, you can, and it's been done for centuries. /T_he old women in Kentucky presumably told her that long ago, and how best to endure.

I love the balloons that float like deities above the aisles in CVS, the balloons made of Mylar and ancient symbolism. These balloons are magic. /T_hese balloons, out in the world, will activate gra - tuitous nonmalignant forces. They'll get you smiles, fist bumps, kisses, drinks. I once walked several blocks with a large balloon in the likeness of SpongeBob SquarePants surg - ing and tugging over my head. People cried out, re/f_lexively\u2014they were glad to see him. (That balloon later escaped, and I watched SpongeBob recede, grinning, into the blue-eyed void of the sky.)

A lot of pathos, for whatever reason, attaches to this balloon. Then there is the irre - pressible balloon, the bal-loon pumped taut with car-toon levity. A balloon of this sort is essentially an arrested impulse. A trapped prayer, if you like. Each balloon repre - sents a thwarted attempt by that noble and high-spirited gas, helium, to /f_ly joyfully up to heaven. But the balloon doesn't care. Brainless and glorious, it bobs about. Its urge to tran - scend is perfectly contained. Life is heavy, heavy, heavy. Since we crawled up onto dry land, gravity has been patiently dismantling us\u2014we sag, we stoop, our lower backs hurt. Experience accumulates, and it has its own weight. Bring on the balloons.
