Another brand-name Tdap vaccine is also available, called [Adacel](/articles/drugs-boostrix-vs-adacel). (For more about Adacel, see the \" [Boostrix vs. Adacel](/articles/boostrix#boostrix-vs-adacel)\" section below.) Boostrix can cause mild or serious side effects. The following lists contain some of the key side effects that may occur after taking Boostrix. These lists don't include all possible side effects. For more information about the possible side effects of Boostrix, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. They can give you tips on how to manage any side effects that may be concerning or bothersome. Note: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tracks side effects of vaccines it has approved. If you would like to report to the FDA a side effect you've had with Boostrix, you can do so through [MedWatch](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/index.cfm). Mild side effects Below is a partial list of mild side effects of Boostrix. To learn about other mild side effects, talk with your doctor or pharmacist or view Boostrix's [prescribing information](https://www.gsksource.com/pharma/content/dam/GlaxoSmithKline/US/en/Prescribing_Information/Boostrix/pdf/BOOSTRIX.PDF). Mild side effects of Boostrix can include: - injection site reactions (pain, redness or other discoloration, and swelling at the injection site) [fatigue](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248002)(lack reaction](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/264419)* Most of these side effects may go away within a few days or a couple of weeks. But if they become more severe or don't go away, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. * For more information about allergic reaction and Boostrix, see the \"Allergic reaction\" section below. Serious side effects Serious side effects from Boostrix aren't common, but they can occur. Call your doctor right away if you have serious side effects. Call 911 or your local emergency number if your symptoms feel life threatening or if you think you're having a medical emergency. Serious side effects can include: - severe allergic reaction* [fainting](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/182524)after receiving Boostrix, which may result in a fall * For more information about allergic reaction and Boostrix, see the \"Allergic reaction\" section below. Side effects in children Boostrix is approved for use in children ages 10 years and older. In [clinical studies](https://gskpro.com/content/dam/global/hcpportal/en_US/Prescribing_Information/Boostrix/pdf/BOOSTRIX.PDF#i4i_section_id_fe000860-71d4-43db-b3d6-193712ae2e95), side effects in this age group were similar to side effects in adults, as described above and below. However, mild side effects were more common in children ages 10-18 years than in adults. Side effects that were more common in this age group included: - headache - fatigue - fever - nausea - vomiting - diarrhea - abdominal pain In addition, injection site reactions such as pain, discoloration, and swelling were more common in children ages 10-12 old years than in older age groups. ALLERGIC REACTION As with most drugs, some people can have an allergic reaction after receiving Boostrix. This side effect wasn't reported in clinical trials. But there are rare reports of allergic reaction since Boostrix became available for use. Symptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include: - skin rash - itchiness - flushing A more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include: - swelling under your skin, typically in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet - swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat - trouble breathing Call your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction to Boostrix, as the reaction could become severe. Call 911 or your local emergency number if your symptoms feel life threatening or if you think you're having a medical emergency. If you can become pregnant, consider the following information about pregnancy, birth control, and breastfeeding before receiving Boostrix. Boostrix and pregnancy Boostrix isn't known to have harmful effects when you get the vaccine during pregnancy. In fact, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/get-vaccinated.html) [Tdap vaccine](https://www.healthline.com/health/new-baby-vaccination-guide/tdap-vaccine), such as Boostrix, during Weeks 27-36 of each pregnancy you have. This helps protect your baby from contracting [pertussis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257706) (whooping cough) in the first weeks after birth. Newborns who contract pertussis will likely need hospital treatment. And in some cases, pertussis in newborns can lead to death. But newborns can't get their first vaccine against this disease until they're 2 months old. Having a Tdap vaccine, such as Boostrix, in the [third trimester](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/third-trimester-pregnancy) of your pregnancy causes your body to make antibodies against pertussis. (Antibodies are [immune system](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320101) proteins that help fight [infection](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/196271).) During pregnancy, the antibodies pass to the fetus, helping protect them from pertussis after they're born. If you're pregnant or plan to become pregnant, talk with your doctor about the best time to have Boostrix or a different Tdap vaccine. Boostrix pregnancy registry A [pregnancy registry](https://www.fda.gov/science-research/womens-health-research/registry-information-pregnant-women) If you receive the Boostrix vaccine while pregnant, talk with your doctor about enrolling in the registry. You can also call [888-452-9622](tel:%208884529622) or visit the [registry website](https://pregnancyregistry.gsk.com/boostrix.html#:~:text=Patients%20can%20be%20registered%20by,9622%20(toll%2Dfree).&text=Information%20collected%20at%20the%20time,of%20the%20subsequent%20pregnancy%20outcome.) to learn more. Boostrix and breastfeeding Boostrix isn't known to be harmful if you get the vaccine while breastfeeding. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/safety-side-effects.html) [Tdap vaccine](https://www.healthline.com/health/new-baby-vaccination-guide/tdap-vaccine), such as Boostrix, if you're currently breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It's not known whether the vaccine ingredients pass into breast milk. But some of the antibodies your body makes in response to the vaccine will pass into your breast milk and can help protect your child. It's still best to get a Tdap vaccine during your pregnancy because this protects your child from [pertussis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257706) after birth. If you have questions about Boostrix or a different Tdap vaccine, given your breastfeeding plans, talk with your doctor. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about Boostrix. Is Boostrix a live vaccine? No, Boostrix is a non-live (inactive) vaccine. It contains inactive substances produced by the [bacteria](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/157973) that cause [tetanus](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/163063) and [diphtheria](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159534). Boostrix also contains fragments of the bacteria that cause [pertussis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257706) (whooping cough). None of these substances or bacterial fragments can cause disease. Live vaccines contain live, but weakened forms of bacteria or viruses. Examples include the [yellow fever](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/174372) vaccine and the [shingles vaccine](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326667). Live vaccines shouldn't cause [infections](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/196271) in people whose [immune systems](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320101) work well. But there's a risk that live vaccines could cause infections in people with reduced immune system activity. These people shouldn't have live vaccines, but they may be able to have non-live vaccines. If you have questions about whether you can receive Boostrix, talk with your doctor. Does Boostrix cause autism? No. Boostrix doesn't cause [autism](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323758) either in children who get the vaccine or in children born to females* who get the vaccine during pregnancy. The idea that vaccines could cause autism has become fairly widespread in recent years. This is despite the fact that there is no evidence of a link. In fact, over decades of research, no vaccines have ever been found to cause autism. This is also the case for Boostrix. For example, a [2018 study](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/3/e20180120) examined the rate of autism in 81,993 children. Researchers looked at the rate of autism spectrum disorder in children whose mothers had received a [Tdap vaccine](https://www.healthline.com/health/new-baby-vaccination-guide/tdap-vaccine), such as Boostrix, during their pregnancy. The researchers compared this with the rate of autism in children whose mothers didn't receive this vaccine during pregnancy. No significant difference in the rates of autism was found between the two groups. * [Sex and gender](/articles/232363) exist on spectrums. Use of the term \"female\" in this article refers to sex assigned at birth. How long does Boostrix last? The immunity (protection) that Boostrix produces lasts about 10 years. However, immunity to pertussis tends to lessen over this time. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/public/index.html#how-well-do-they-work) - 97% of people against diphtheria for about 10 years - almost 100% of people against tetanus for about 10 years - 70% of people against pertussis for the first year after vaccination - 30% to 40% of people against pertussis 4 years after vaccination If you have questions about how often you'll need to get Boostrix or other vaccines, talk with your doctor. Your doctor will advise you on when you should receive the Boostrix vaccine. Be sure to follow the vaccine schedule that your doctor recommends for you. Drug forms and strengths A healthcare professional will give you Boostrix as an [intramuscular injection](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323115) in your upper arm. (\"Intramuscular\" means that the injection is given in a muscle.) Boostrix comes as a liquid suspension (a liquid mixture). The vaccine comes in a 0.5-milliliter (mL) single-dose vial and a 0.5-mL single-dose prefilled syringe. Dosage for preventing tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis The dose of Boostrix for helping prevent [tetanus](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/163063), [diphtheria](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159534), and [pertussis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257706) is 0.5 mL, given as an intramuscular injection. The [adult immunization schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html) [Tdap vaccination](https://www.healthline.com/health/new-baby-vaccination-guide/tdap-vaccine), such as Boostrix, for the following groups: - Adults who've never been vaccinated against [diphtheria](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159534), [tetanus](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/163063), or [pertussis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257706). It's also recommended that adults get a booster dose of the tetanus and diphtheria vaccine every 10 years. A booster vaccine is used to \"boost\" the effects of an earlier vaccine a person has been given. - Adults who have a severe or dirty cut, wound, or [burn](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/burns)and who haven't had a tetanus booster in the last 5 years. Note: Boosters can be given with a Tdap vaccine, such as Boostrix, or with a Td vaccine. (A Td vaccine helps prevent tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis.) Dosage when given during pregnancy Boostrix is approved for administration during the [third trimester](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/third-trimester-pregnancy) of pregnancy to help protect babies from contracting pertussis in the first weeks after birth. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/get-vaccinated.html) Children's dosage Boostrix is approved for use in children ages 10 years and older. The [child immunization schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html) If your child did not receive all of their [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP)](https://www.healthline.com/health/adult-vaccines/tdap-vs-dtap-vaccines-difference)* vaccines, a Tdap vaccine such as Boostrix may be given as a [\"catch-up\" vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/job-aids/tdap.pdf) Otherwise, the recommended dosage for children is the same as for adults, as described above. * Children younger than age 7 years typically receive the DTaP vaccine, which contains a full dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines. A Tdap vaccine, such as Boostrix, contains a full dose of the tetanus vaccine and reduced doses of the diphtheria and pertussis vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves vaccines such as Boostrix to help prevent certain conditions. Boostrix for preventing tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis Boostrix is FDA-approved to help prevent [tetanus](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/163063), [diphtheria](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159534), and [pertussis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257706) (whooping cough) in adults as well as children ages 10 years and older. It's also approved for use during pregnancy (see below). Boostrix is also called a [Tdap vaccine](https://www.healthline.com/health/new-baby-vaccination-guide/tdap-vaccine). Tetanus (sometimes called lockjaw), diphtheria, and pertussis are diseases caused by [infection](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/196271) with different types of [bacteria](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/157973). In some cases, these conditions can each be fatal. In the United States and many other countries, children up to the age of 6 years old are typically given five doses of vaccines to help prevent tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis ( [DTaP vaccines](https://www.healthline.com/health/adult-vaccines/tdap-vs-dtap-vaccines-difference)). However, the effectiveness of this first round of vaccines wears off over time. Booster vaccines are given to produce ongoing [immunity](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320101) (protection) from tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Boostrix can be given as your first Tdap vaccine or as a booster vaccine. Boostrix given during pregnancy for preventing pertussis The FDA has approved Boostrix to be given during the [third trimester](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/third-trimester-pregnancy) of pregnancy to help protect babies from contracting pertussis in the first weeks after birth. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/get-vaccinated.html) You can refer to the \" [Things to consider when taking Boostrix](/articles/boostrix#considerations)\" section above for details about receiving the vaccine during pregnancy. Boostrix and children Boostrix is FDA-approved for use in children ages 10 years and older. Children are typically given a dose of Boostrix at 11-12 years old. Ages Boostrix is approved for Boostrix is approved for use in adults of any age, as well as children ages 10 years and older. Doctors may also give Boostrix to children ages 7 years and older who haven't completed their full DTaP vaccines in the past. There are two brands of Tdap vaccine available: Boostrix and [Adacel](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-boostrix-vs-adacel). As with Boostrix, Adacel is approved for use in children ages 10 years and older. Adacel is also approved for use in adults ages 64 years and younger. This means that older adults (ages 65 years and older) can receive Boostrix but not Adacel. The Adacel vaccine has uses similar to those of Boostrix. Both vaccines are approved to help prevent [tetanus](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/163063), [diphtheria](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159534), and [pertussis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257706) (whooping cough). They're both [Tdap vaccines](https://www.healthline.com/health/new-baby-vaccination-guide/tdap-vaccine). For details about how Boostrix and Adacel compare, you can refer to [this article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-boostrix-vs-adacel). Boostrix can [interact](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drug-interactions) with several other medications. Before taking Boostrix, talk with your doctor and pharmacist. Tell them about all prescription, over-the-counter, and other drugs you take. Also, tell them about any [vitamins, herbs, and supplements](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/vitamins-minerals-supplements) you use. Sharing this information can help you avoid potential interactions. Medication interactions [Immunosuppressant](https://www.healthline.com/health/immunosuppressant-drugs) drugs can interact with Boostrix. Examples of these drugs include: [chemotherapy](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158401)drugs for high doses of [corticosteroids](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/corticosteroids), such as [prednisone](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/prednisone-oral-tablet)(Rayos) This list does not contain all drugs that may interact with Boostrix. If you have questions about drug interactions that may affect you, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Alcohol interaction Alcohol is not known to interact with Boostrix. It's likely safe to consume alcohol around the time you receive the vaccine. But if you have certain side effects from the vaccine, such as a [headache](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/73936) or [fatigue](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248002), then drinking alcohol could make them worse. If you have questions about how much alcohol is safe to drink while taking Boostrix, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. Other vaccines are available that can help prevent [tetanus](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/163063), [diphtheria](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159534), and [pertussis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/257706). Some may be a better fit for you than others. If you're interested in finding an alternative to Boostrix, talk with your doctor. They can tell you about other vaccines that may work well for you.
