The countries party to the Nice Agreement constitute a Special Union within the framework of the Paris Union for the Protection of Industrial Property . They have adopted and apply the Nice Classification for the purposes of the registration of marks. Each of the countries party to the Nice Agreement is obliged to apply the Nice Classification in connection with the registration of marks, either as the principalclassification or as a subsidiary classification, and has to include in the official documents andpublications relating to its registrations of marks the numbers of the classes of theClassification to which the goods or services for which the marks are registered belong. Use of the Nice Classification is mandatory not only for the national registration of marks in countries party to the Nice Agreement, but also for the international registration ofmarks effected by the International Bureau of WIPO, under the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and under the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks , and for the registration of marks by the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI), by theBenelux Trademark Office and by the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (TradeMarks and Designs) (OHIM). The Nice Classification is also applied in a number of countries not party to the Nice Agreement (see list on page (viii)). REVISIONS OF THE NICE CLASSIFICATION The Nice Classification is based on the Classification prepared by the United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property (BIRPI)\u2014predecessor of WIPO\u2014in 1935. It was that Classification, consisting of a list of 34 classes and analphabetical list of goods, that was adopted under the Nice Agreement and later expanded toembrace also eleven classes covering services and an alphabetical list of those services. The Nice Agreement provides for the setting up of a Committee of Experts in which all countries party to the Agreement are represented. The Committee of Experts decides on allchanges in the Classification, in particular the transfer of goods and services between variousclasses, the updating of the alphabetical list and the introduction of necessary explanatorynotes.(vi)The Committee of Experts has, since the entry into force of the Nice Agreement, on April 8, 1961, held 18 sessions and has, amongst its most noticeable achievements,undertaken a general review of the Alphabetical List of goods and services from the point ofview of form (in the late 1970s); substantially modified the General Remarks, the ClassHeadings and the Explanatory Notes (in 1982); introduced a \"basic number\" for each singleproduct or service in the Alphabetical List (in 1990), which number enables the user to findthe equivalent product or service in the alphabetical lists of other language versions of theClassification; and revised Class 42 with the creation of Classes 43 to 45 (in 2000). At its eighteenth session, held in October 2000, the Committee of Experts adopted changes to the seventh edition of the Nice Classification. EDITIONS OF THE NICE CLASSIFICATION The first edition of the Nice Classification was published in 1963, the second in 1971, the third in 1981, the fourth in 1983, the fifth in 1987, the sixth in 1992 and the seventhin 1996. This edition (the eighth), published in June 2001, will enter into force onJanuary 1, 2002. * * * The authentic versions of the Nice Classification (English and French) are published in two parts. Part I lists, in alphabetical order, all the goods in one list and all the services inanother list. Part II (this volume) lists, in alphabetical order for each class, the goods orservices belonging to that class. There is also a version with a bilingual (English/French)alphabetical list.

If the applicant does not give such indication, the International Bureau shall classify the goods and services in the appropriate classes of the said classification. The indication of classes given by the applicant shall be subject to control by the International Bureau, which shall exercise the said control in association with the Office of origin. In the event of disagreement between the said Office and the International Bureau, the opinion of thelatter shall prevail. Article 4 Effects of International Registration (1)(a) From the date of the registration or recordal effected in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 3 ter, the protection of the mark in each of the Contracting Parties concerned shall be the same as if the mark had been deposited direct with the Office of that Contracting Party. If no refusal has been notified to the International Bureau in accordance with Article 5(1) and (2) or if a refusal notified in accordance with the said Article has been withdrawn subsequently, the protection of the mark in the Contracting Party concerned shall, as from the said date, be the same as if the mark hadbeen registered by the Office of that Contracting Party. (b) The indication of classes of goods and services provided for in Article 3 shall not bind the Contracting Parties with regard to the determination of the scope of the protection of the mark. 3On December 31, 2000, the following States were party to this Protocol: Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bhutan, China, Cuba, Czech Republic, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Denmark,Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Latvia, Lesotho,Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco, Morocco, Mozambique, Netherlands, Norway, Poland,Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Yugoslavia (49).Madrid Protocol (extracts) __________________________________________________________________________________ (xxiv)Article 5 Refusal and Invalidation of Effects of International Registration in Respect of Certain Contracting Parties (1) Where the applicable legislation so authorizes, any Office of a Contracting Party which has been notified by the International Bureau of an extension to that Contracting Party, underArticle 3 ter(1) or (2), of the protection resulting from the international registration shall have the right to declare in a notification of refusal that protection cannot be granted in the said Contracting Party to the mark which is the subject of such extension. Any such refusal can be based only on the grounds which would apply, under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in the case of a mark deposited direct with the Office which notifies the refusal. However, protection may not berefused, even partially, by reason only that the applicable legislation would permit registration only in a limited number of classes or for a limited number of goods or services. Article 8 Fees for International Application and Registration (2) Registration of a mark at the International Bureau shall be subject to the advance payment of an international fee which shall, subject to the provisions of paragraph (7)(a), include, (i) a basic fee; (ii) a supplementary fee for each class of the International Classification, beyond three, into which the goods or services to which the mark is applied will fall; (iii) a complementary fee for any request for extension of protection under Article 3 ter. (3) However, the supplementary fee specified in paragraph (2)(ii) may, without prejudice to the date of the international registration, be paid within the period fixed by the Regulations if the number of classes of goods or services has been fixed or disputed by the International Bureau. If,upon expiry of the said period, the supplementary fee has not been paid or the list of goods or services has not been reduced to the required extent by the applicant, the international application shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Article 9 Recordal of Change in the Ownership of an International Registration At the request of the person in whose name the international registration stands, or at the request of an interested Office made ex officio or at the request of an interested person, the International Bureau shall record in the International Register any change in the ownership of that registration, in respect of all or some of the Contracting Parties in whose territories the said registration has effect and in respect of all or some of the goods and services listed in the registration, provided that the new holder is a person who, under Article 2(1), is entitled to file international applications. * * *NICE CLASSIFICATIONNice Classification (8th Edition) __________________________________________________________________________________ 1GUIDANCE FOR THE USER 1. The class headings indicate in a general manner the fields to which the goods and services in principle belong. 2. For ascertaining the correct classification of each individual produc t or service, the Alphabetical List of goods and services and the Explanatory Notes, relating to the various classes, should be consulted. If a product or service cannot be classified with the aid of the List of Classes, the Explanatory Notes and the Alphabetical List, the General Remarks (see page 3, below) set forth the criteria that should be applied. 3. The Alphabetical List is reproduced, in Class order, in two sets of four columns on each page, which for each product or service indicates: the first column: the serial number4 of the indication of the product or service, in English; the second column: the indication of the product or service, in English; the third column: the serial number4 of the corresponding French indication of the product or service. the fourth column: the basic number4 of the indication of the product or service. 4. It should be noted that a given product or service may appear in the Alphabetical List in more than one place, i.e., the product or service is described with different indications, so-called cross- references. 5. The fact that a general term is given in the Alphabetical List in relation to a particular class (covering certain goods or services) does not rule out the possibility of that term appearing also in connection with other classes (covering other goods or services), depending on the way in which the term is qualified. In such cases, the general term (e.g., Clothing, Paints) is marked with an asterisk in the Alphabetical List. 6. In the Alphabetical List, an express ion between square brackets is in most cases intended to define more precisely the text preceding the brackets, since the said text is ambiguous or too vague for classification purposes. Sometimes, the square brackets embrace the corresponding American expression of the text preceding the brackets, in most cases of which the expression is followed by \"(Am.)\". 4While the serial number of a given product or service is specific to each language version of the Classification, its basic number is the same for every language version of the Classification that has been published by, or in collaboration with, WIPO. The basic number enables the user of the Classification to find the equivalent product or service in the alphabetical lists of other language versions of the Classification.Nice Classification (8th Edition) __________________________________________________________________________________ 27. In the Alphabetical List, an expression between round brackets may constitute a different indication of the product or service in question, which in that case also is listed (a so-called cross- reference) in its appropriate place in the Alphabetical List. In other cases, an expression between round brackets may begin with a general term (e.g., apparatus, conducting, machines) under which the product or service cannot be listed in the Alphabetical List. The text preceding the round brackets is considered the most important part of the indication of the product or service in question, and is replaced within the brackets by \"-\". 8. For the purposes of the registration of marks, it is highly recommended to use the indications appearing in the Alphabetical List when qualifying goods or services, avoiding using the vague expressions or the general terms, which are not sufficiently qualified. 9. The fact t hat a product or service indication figures in the Alphabetical List does not in any way prejudge the decisions of national industrial property offices as to the possibility of registering a mark for that product or service (see Article 2(1) of the Nice Agreement).Nice Classification (8th Edition) __________________________________________________________________________________ 3GENERAL REMARKS The indications of goods or services appearing in the class headings are general indications relating to the fields to which, in principle, the goods or services belong. The Alphabetical List should therefore be consulted in order to ascertain the exact classification of each individual product or service. GOODS If a product cannot be classified with the aid of the List of Classes, the Explanatory Notes and the Alphabetical List, the following remarks set forth the criteria to be applied: (a) A finished product is in principle classified according to its function or purpose. If the function or purpose of a finished product is not mentioned in any class heading, the finished product is classified by analogy with other comparable finished products, indicated in the Alphabetical List. If none is found, other subsidiary criteria, such as that of the material of which the product is made or its mode of operation, are applied. (b) A finished product which is a multipurpose composi te object (e.g., clocks incorporating radios) may be classified in all classes that correspond to any of its functions or intended purposes. If those functions or purposes are not mentioned in any class heading, other criteria, indicated under (a), above, are to be applied. (c) Raw materials, unworked or semi-worked, are in principle classified according to the material of which they consist. (d) Goods intended to form part of another product are in principle classified in the same class as that product only in cases where the same type of goods cannot normally be used for another purpose. In all other cases, the criterion indicated under (a), above, applies. (e) When a product, whether finished or not, is classified according to the material of which it is made, and it is made of different materials, the product is in principle classified according to the material which predominates. (f) Cases adapted to the product they are intended to contain are in principle classified in the same class as the product. SERVICES If a service cannot be classified with the aid of the List of Classes, the Explanatory Notes and the Alphabetical List, the following remarks set forth the criteria to be applied: (a) Services are in principle classified according to the bra nches of activities specified in the headings of the service classes and in their Explanatory Notes or, if not specified, by analogy with other comparable services indicated in the Alphabetical List. (b) Rental services are in principle classified in the same classes as the services provided by means of the rented objects (e.g., Rental of telephones, covered by Class 38). (c) Services that provide advice, information or consultation are in principle classified in the same classes as the services that correspond to the subject matter of the advice, information or consultation, e.g., transportation consultancy (Cl. 39), business management consultancy (Cl. 35), financial consultancy (Cl. 36), beauty consultancy (Cl. 44). The rendering of the advice, information or consultancy by electronic means (e.g., telephone, computer) does not affect the classification of these services.Nice Classification (8th Edition) __________________________________________________________________________________ 4CLASS HEADINGS GOODS Class 1 Chemicals used in industry, science and photography, as well as in agriculture, horticulture and forestry;
