It also supports the layperson who has received a diagnosis of a serious disease or disorder as well as the family member or nonprofessional caregiver who must learn to care and to cope with the illness. Each volume in the series deals comprehensively with a particular area of medical concern and contains material found in publications issued by the National Institutes of Health and other agencies and associations. Nowhere else can general readers find this information conveniently collected, coordinated, and indexed in book form. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies play a key role in the health care of many Americans. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine reports that in the United States, about four in 10 adults and about one in nine children use some form of CAM, such as deep breathing, dietary supplements, massage, meditation, or yoga. CAM, alone or in conjunction with mainstream medicine, is often used to treat an increasing variety of diseases and conditions, such as arthritis, anxiety, back pain, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and sleep problems. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Sourcebook, Fourth Edition provides updated information for people considering these therapies for general well-being or specific health conditions. It discusses how to select a CAM practitioner, talk with a primary health care provider about using CAM, evaluate information on the internet, and pay for CAM therapies. It describes whole medical systems, such as Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, Native American medicine, acupuncture, homeopathy, and naturopathy. It also talks about the safe use of dietary supplements, including vitamins, minerals, and herbs. Information on biologically based therapies, mind-body medicine, manipulative and body-based therapies, and energy-based therapies is also included. A glossary of related terms and a directory of additional resources provide additional help and information. - MeSH: - Complementary Therapies* - Publication Type(s): - Collected Work Popular Work Resource Guide - Notes: - Includes bibliographical references and index. - Contents: - Preface -- Part 1: Overview Of Complementary And Alternative Medicine (CAM) -- 1: What is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)? -- 2: Common questions and answers about CAM -- 3: Use of CAM in the United States -- 4: CAM use and children -- 5: CAM use in older adults -- 6: Health care providers and CAM -- 6-1: Selecting a CAM practitioner -- 6-2: Tips for talking with your health care providers about CAM -- 7: Insurance issues and paying for CAM treatment -- 8: Health fraud awareness -- 9: Use caution buying medical products online -- Part 2: Alternative Medicine Systems -- 10: What are whole medical systems? -- 11: Ayurvedic medicine -- 12: Other indigenous medical systems -- 12-1: Traditional Chinese medicine -- 12-2: Native American medicine -- 13: Acupuncture -- 14: Homeopathy -- 15: Naturopathy -- Part 3: Dietary Supplements -- 16: Questions and answers about dietary supplements -- 17: Botanical dietary supplements -- 18: Using dietary supplements wisely -- 19: Adolescents and supplement use -- 20: Tips for older dietary supplement users -- 21: Vitamin A and carotenoids -- 22: Vitamin B6 -- 23: Vitamin B12 -- -- and flaxseed oils -- 29: Selenium -- 30: Bone and joint health supplements -- 30-1: Calcium supplements and bone health -- 30-2: Glucosamine/chondroitin supplements and joint health -- 31: Immune system support supplements -- 31-1: Echinacea -- 31-2: Zinc -- 32: Mood and brain supplements -- 32-1: Ginkgo Biloba -- 32-2: St John's supplements for gastrointestinal health -- 34: Sports and energy supplements -- 34-1: Sports supplements -- 34-2: Energy drinks -- 35: Supplements used for weight loss -- 35-1: Green tea -- 35-2: Hoodia -- Part 4: Biologically Based Therapies -- 36: based therapies: an overview -- 37: Apitherapy -- 38: Aromatherapy and essential oils -- 39: Diet-based therapies -- 39-1: Detoxification diets -- 39-2: -- 39-5: Veganism -- 39-6: Vegetarianism -- 40: -- Part 5: Mind-Body Medicine -- 41: Mind-body medicine: an overview -- 42: Art therapy -- 43: Biofeedback -- 44: Deep breathing exercises -- 45: Feng shui -- 46: Guided imagery and hypnosis -- 46-1: Guided imagery -- 46-2: Hypnosis -- 47: Meditation -- 48: Music therapy -- 49: Prayer and spirituality -- 50: Relaxation training -- 51: Tai chi -- 52: Yoga -- 53: Other mind-body medicine therapies -- 53-1: Color therapy -- 53-2: Dance therapy -- Part 6: Manipulative And Body-Based Therapies -- 54: Manipulative and body-based therapies: an overview -- 55: Alexander technique -- 56: Aquatic therapy (Hydrotherapy) -- 57: Chiropractic care and osteopathic manipulation -- 58: Craniosacral therapy -- 59: Feldenkrais method -- 60: Massage therapy -- 60-1: Massage therapy overview -- 60-2: Lymphatic drainage massage -- 60-3: Tui Na: Chinese Pilates -- 62: Qigong -- 63: Reflexology -- 64: Structural integration techniques 64-1: Hellerwork structural integration -- 64-2: Rolfing -- 65: Other and body-based therapies -- Applied kinesiology -- 65-2: Bowen technique -- 65-3: Trager -- Part 7: Energy-Based Therapies -- 66: Energy medicine: an overview -- 67: Magnet therapy -- 68: Polarity therapy -- 69: Reiki -- 70: Shiatsu -- touch -- Other energy-based therapies -- 72-1: Bioresonance therapy -- 72-2: Crystal and gem therapy -- 72-3: Zero balancing -- Part 8: Alternative Treatments For Specific Diseases And Conditions -- 73: Arthritis and CAM -- 74: Asthma, allergies, and CAM -- 75: Cancer and CAM -- 76: Cognitive decline and CAM -- 77: Diabetes and CAM -- 78: Fibromyalgia and CAM -- 79: Headache and CAM -- 80: Heart disease and chelation therapy -- 81: Hepatitis C and CAM -- 82: Hormones, CAM, and aging -- 83: Infertility and CAM -- 83-1: Herbal remedies for infertility -- 83-2: Infertility and CAM -- 84: Low back pain and CAM -- 85: Menopausal symptoms and CAM -- 86: Mental health care and CAM -- 86-1: Overview of CAM used in mental health care -- 86-2: Alcohol addiction and electroacupuncture -- 86-3: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and CAM -- 86-4: Anxiety and self-hypnosis -- 86-5: Postraumatic stress disorder and acupuncture -- 87: Sleep disorders and CAM -- Part 9: Additional Help And Information -- 88: Glossary of terms related to alternative and complementary medicine -- 89: Directory of organizations that provide information about alternative and complementary medicine -- Index. - Other ID: "}
