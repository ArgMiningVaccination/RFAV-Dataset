Homeopathy is an effective and scientific system of healing which assists the natural tendency of the body to heal itself. It recognises that all symptoms of ill health are expressions of disharmony within the whole person and that it is the patient who needs treatment not the disease. The practice of homeopathy has been established for 200 years, and remedies act by stimulating the body's own healing power. This stimulus will assist your own system to clear itself of any expressions of imbalance. The aim is to get you to a level of health so that eventually you will need infrequent treatment. It is recommended that you maintain your relationship with your GP who can arrange any tests or X-rays you might need, and by working in this way the two systems of health care can provide complementary services. The Society of Homeopaths maintains an international register of homeopaths (RSHom). Homeopaths on the register practise with a strict Code of Ethics and Practice, hold professional insurance, and have passed stringent academic and clinical assessments before being admitted to the Register. What happens on your first visit? In order to find the right remedy for you as an individual, your homeopath will need to know all about you. A detailed understanding of who you are, along with any complaints and details of how you experience them, is needed to asses your case correctly. So anything you can tell your homeopath that is typical of who you are will help this process. They will also find out about your general energy level, your past medical history and the way you live. The initial consultation may last an hour or more, and anything you say will be treated in the strictest confidence. What will the treatment be like? Your homeopath will give you a homeopathic remedy, usually in the form of a tablet, occasionally as a powder, which should be allowed to dissolve in your mouth; or you may be given a liquid remedy with instructions. Nothing else should be put in the mouth for 20 minutes before or after taking the tablet, not even toothpaste. You will usually be advised to avoid coffee, peppermint and preparations containing menthol, eucalyptus and camphor, as these can interfere with the action of the remedy. And after treatment After taking your remedy you may notice some changes. Some patients experience a period of exceptional well-being and optimism. Sometimes your symptoms can appear to get worse for a short time before improving, which is generally an indication that the remedy is taking effect. Sometimes a cold, rash or some form of discharge may appear as a 'spring cleaning' effect which means your system is going through a clearing stage. If any response to your treatment causes concern, please phone Stillpoint and your homeopath will discuss it with you.
