Most other cleanses are about detox only, but they don't ask the question of how we got toxic in the first place. The Colorado Ayurvedic Cleanse focuses on healing and resetting your entire digestive system so that you can open and maintain the body's detox pathways. Without a clear digestive tract, you won't be able to detox. While some cleanses emphasize extreme fasting and dangerously unbalanced diets, the Colorado Ayurvedic Cleanse relies on a gentle, simple kitchari diet that allows the body to burn fat without hunger pains. The Colorado Ayurvedic Cleanse aims to maintain balanced blood sugar, allowing your body to enjoy the contented blissful energy of natural fat metabolism while you continue working and going about your daily life. Sadly, most other Ayurvedic cleanses have been boiled down to just detox. But Ayurveda is really about complete mind-body transformation. Not only does it address your digestive strength, but it links your physical health to emotional health. An Ayurvedic detox clears your body and your mind, you release old, unwanted behavioral and thought patterns, along with digestive issues and feelings of lethargy and heaviness. Unlike other cleanses, this holistic 14-day journey combines diet, herbs, lymphatic movement, yoga, meditation, and self-inquiry to help you change behaviors\u2014both lifestyle and emotional\u2014that get in the way of your health, longevity, and peace of mind. The Colorado Ayurvedic Cleanse was developed more than a decade ago by John Douillard, DC, CAP. John has 30 years of experience as a Certified Ayurvedic Practitioner. One of the original Western doctors of Ayurveda, he has helped thousands of people heal their digestion, clear their minds, and lead more healthy and happy lives.

What do People Say About the Colorado Ayurvedic Cleanse? *These patient reports reflect the results of individual patients, and as such, results will vary. \"As an editor for such publications as Yoga Journal and Natural Health, I see a lot of 'detox plans.' Most are based on good intentions and pseudoscience. I enrolled in the Colorado Ayurvedic Cleanse because I knew from firsthand experience and multiple interviews and that John Douillard was the real deal. This is a cleanse based on a clear understanding of body dynamics. It's not about suffering, fasting, and denial, but about working with your own body rhythms to create better health. My own results were undeniable. I lost 11 pounds. More importantly, my blood pressure dropped from 160/98 to 125/75. That is a HUGE gain in health. Thank you, Dr. Douillard.\"* \u2014Hillari Dowdle \"I cannot believe how good I feel having done this cleanse. My energy and spirits feel so healthy and my sense of well-being has been restored. Thank you.\"* \u2014Pamela \"As a ballet dancer for many years, I have had my share of unhealthy eating and lifestyle choices with the goal being just to be thin, not to be healthy. And, once I was able to break that cycle, I have done many cleanses in my life and took many herbs, and tried many things to help me with my digestion and enhance my health. But it has only been since doing the Colorado Ayurvedic Cleanse and now continuing with the herbs that Dr. Douillard recommended to me that I find that my body is truly balanced and on track. Your product is phenomenal. And the support and care from everyone who works at LifeSpa and from my one-on-one with Dr. Douillard have been outstanding. Finding LifeSpa has been transformational. Thank you so much.\"* \u2014Liz Rose \"I just wanted to say how glad I am to be in this process with Dr. John and the spa staff. I realized yesterday that on the last day of the main cleanse, I had a feeling of accomplishment. I have followed many restrictive diets and eating programs before. However, having the information and support of Dr. John put me in a place of truly feeling as if I was doing exactly what my body needed. It was a good feeling. So thank you so much, I can't wait until the fall Cleanse] pre-cleanse, my digestive system changed dramatically. The speed of the change really surprised me. From Tuesday to Friday, I woke to a morning bowel movement, when for over a year, I've had nothing but fowl smelling gas and incredible amounts of mucous in the morning. I also had bowel movements after lunch. Wild, since I could not tell you the last time I had two bowel movements in one day. My digestive pain is gone, my bloat is almost gone, and I lost eight pounds by day six of the cleanse. Amazing, I only lost weight from my middle. Now, the weight around my middle is half what it used to be. Additionally, I've struggled with breakouts for several years; By the fourth day of the cleanse, my skin looked incredibly different. The texture of my skin improved dramatically. The insight I've gained during the cleanse so far has been thought-provoking to say the least. Let me tell you, I've released more than toxins. Thanks for this incredible program!* \u2014PD \"I wanted to express my gratitude for what you have shared with us. During the cleanse, I had several things to do, like cook every day for my family (I have two kids), bake a cake for a community picnic, and go out for dinner with friends . . . and, hard to believe, at least for me, I was so happy with my khichadi that I didn't mind at all to have around other kinds of food! It was amazing! I really enjoyed every single day of the cleanse. My little one, almost three, said when she grows up, she will do the 'detox' "}
