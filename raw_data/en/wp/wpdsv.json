Teething is a tough time for any baby and anything that can help to ease their pain and make them more comfortable is usually a welcome solution to making them more comfortable. If your baby has been unusually fussy and irritable, they may be teething. Teething usually starts around six months and can go on until up to 33 months for all of the teeth to come in. A few signs that your baby is teething include increased biting and drooling, fussier than usual, disrupted sleep, and decreased appetite. There are plenty of natural remedies to help sooth your baby and ease some of the discomfort that comes with teething. Here are a few I recommend: Lower Inflammation Teething causes inflammation that can stimulate the nerves and increase pain. Focusing on lowering inflammation is a good way to ease any additional discomfort. Feed your baby natural and simple foods with fewer inflammation causing ingredients like white sugar and flour. This can also balance blood sugar which can also help to lower inflammation. Cold Using something cold to help numb and soothe gums can be a big help with discomfort from teething. Let your baby chew on a partially frozen cloth. This will help with their increased desire to bite as well as help to numb their pain spots. Pressure You'll see increased biting while a baby is teething because putting pressure seems to help sooth pain. There are plenty of safe toys made specifically for teething babies. Just make sure you do your research! You want teething toys that are safe and made for teething.

Herbal Remedies You can always turn to natural herbal remedies that your mother, grandmother, and great grandmother probably used to help with teething. Rosehip contains immune boosting and anti-inflammatory qualities. Chamomile helps to soothe irritability, just think of your chamomile sleepy time tea. These can either be made into a drink to give your baby or they can be made into an infusion for natural pain relief. Teething Gel Topical teething gels can be applied directly onto the gums for pain relief. Gels like the [Camilia teething drops](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KG7U16/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005KG7U16&linkCode=as2&tag=dinodesignco-20&linkId=f2e2a1ca905c82194621a31f39a56237) temporarily relieve symptoms of teething, including painful gums and irritability, as well as minor digestive disorders sometimes associated with teething. There is no doubt that teething can be a difficult time for both baby and parents but with some of the right natural solutions, you ease your baby's discomfort throughout the process. "}
