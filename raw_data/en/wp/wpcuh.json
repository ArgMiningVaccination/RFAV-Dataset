She serves as an ad hoc member of the ACIP working group on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and as a scientific advisor for the Oxford University on their ChimpAd vectored-coronavirus vaccine program. As a member of SAGE, she advises the WHO on use of COVID-19 vaccines as data become available. Dr. Neuzil's research and leadership capabilities are complimented by over two decades of involvement in domestic & international vaccine policy, including membership on CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and past & current advisory positions on World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine policy committees. She is currently a member of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). Dr. Kathy Neuzil has a strong commitment to mentoring the next generation of vaccine scientists & leaders. This includes formal academic mentorship & participation on masters & PhD dissertation committees. She currently serves as Contact PI (Multi PI mechanism) of the University of Maryland School of Medicine Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health's NIAID T32 Training Grant in Vaccinology, as a mentor on K01 Awards. Beyond these specific trainee-focused grants, Dr. Neuzil works with trainees at all levels in my research. As PI or Co-PI of large multicenter initiatives funded by NIH & the Gates Foundation, she actively seeks opportunities for trainees. "}
