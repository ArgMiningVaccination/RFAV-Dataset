Is ComPASS Care right for my child? Our ComPASS care team may be appropriate for your child if your child has been diagnosed with a serious, life-threatening or potentially life-limiting condition. Many children who receive ComPASS care are also receiving care to help save their life and treat the underlying problem. Conditions that our team provides care for include serious neurologic disorders, severe cerebral palsy, cancers with poor prognosis, serious cardiac conditions and severe genetic abnormalities \u2014 just to name a few. There is no age limit, as our team cares for children before birth (prenatally) throughout early adulthood.
