[Stress is bad for the immune system](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html), which puts people at greater risk for infectious diseases like the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The good news is that you can boost your immune system and resistance to illness using food therapy, according to [Meghan Mabe](https://www.nwhealth.edu/faculty/meghan-mabe/), a Licensed Acupuncturist and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner at Northwestern Health Sciences University's [Bloomington Clinic](https://www.nwhealth.edu/clinics/health-clinic-bloomington/). \"From a TCM perspective, prevention is more important than cure,\" says Mabe. \"Stress management is very important, so it doesn't lead to increased anxiety, which can negatively affect our immune systems. These food therapy recipes are meant to help boost your immune system to help prevent disease, they aren't a cure for any specific illness.\" These four recipes, in addition to being delicious and nutritious, provide important nutrients that can help your body maintain good health. 1. Beef Bone Broth If you're looking for deeply nourishing recipe, beef bone broth is a great choice. \"There are so many benefits to bone broth,\" Mabe says. \"In TCM, bone broths boost energy, or qi, nourish blood, and restore adrenal function, which is affected by stress.\" Beef Bone Broth Ingredients - 4 pounds beef bones - 1 white onion, halved - 2-inch knob of fresh ginger, unpeeled, halved - 2 leeks, white parts only, roughly chopped - 3 large carrots, unpeeled, sliced into thick rounds - 1 TBSP apple cider vinegar - \u00bd tsp whole cloves (optional) - \u00bd tsp star anise (optional) - Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Beef Bone Broth Cooking Instructions Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the bones in a large roasting pan. To save time, add the onions and ginger with the bones so they begin to caramelizing as well. Roast for about 30 minutes or until the bones are brown and crackly and juice has started to collect. Let the bones cool slightly and then transfer them to a stockpot, Or if you're using the same pot, add 3 quarts water or enough to cover the bones, roasted garlic and onions. Add the leeks, carrots, vinegar and optional spices. Bring to a boil over high heat, skim off any foam that rises. Reduce heat to a simmer for 2 to 4 hours, covered, checking every so often to skim off any additional foam. Remove from heat, strain and season with salt and pepper. *You can use chicken bones if you prefer. Chicken bones do not need to be roasted first. Drink bone broth warm or use in soups, stews and congees over the next several days. Tips: to make broth in a slow cooker, set on medium or low and cook for approximately 8 hours. Remove any fat that forms on top.
