This was a hermeneutic study along the lines indicated by Gadamer, on the courses and lectures on medicine given by Steiner. Four main summarized proposals regarding his thinking are presented: (1) a critique of the model of materialistic science that can be expanded through Goethean phenomenology; (2) anthroposophic threefolding and fourfolding as interpretative keys for the health-illness process; (3) integration between human beings and nature as the foundation of research on new treatments; and (4) the link between moral development and scientific and technical training in medical education. The limits and potentials of these proposals were analyzed from the perspective of the viability of epistemological plurality within medical knowledge and practices. Medical - 77 .
