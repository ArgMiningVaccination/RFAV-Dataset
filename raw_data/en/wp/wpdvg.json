NEW YORK IPLG-38/73 23 July 1973 Dear Mr. Secretary General, Please, find attached herewith the text of the letter addressed by Mr. Henry R. Labouisse, Executive Director of UNICEF, on 23 July, to Doctor Nguyen Van Tin, Vice-President of the DRV Red Cross, who is also Vice- Minister of Health, and whom the delegation of UNICEF, comprised of Mr. M. Sandberg and myself, met twice in Hanoi. Following the two meetings held by the UNICEF delegation in Hanoi with the Special Representative of the PRG, Mr. Nguyen Van Tien, Head of the Special Mission in Hanoi, a cable addressed to him is being drafted. As soon as it is in final form, a copy will be forwarded to you. Yours sincerely, Jx?Q e_J>i^, <O-e.O-~ <~~c\"-~' Jacques Beaumont Indochina Peninsula Liaison Group Mr. Kurt Waldheim Secretary General United Nations New YorkLetter addressed from Mr. Henry R. Labouisse, Executive Director of UNICEF TO Doctor Nguyen Van Tin, Vice President, DRV Red Cross Dear Mr. Vice-President, ^- I am writing to express on behalf of UNICEF my ihanks for the way the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Red Cross have received two of our senior staff, Mr. Martin Sandberg and Mr. Jacques Beaumont. They have both told me of the warm welcome and. courtesies extended to them on this their first visit to your country. I have had also a full report from them on the Sis cuss ions held in Hanoi^from 30 June to 7 July 1973- These discussions were for the purpose of.seeking a basis for cooperation between year country and UNICEF and,' more specifically, to identify concrete -ways in which UNICEF might provide support and assistance to programmes for the \"benefit of children and mothers in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam in such fields as health and educatior . I have been impressed by the friendly spirit of mutual cooperation in which these discussions were held, as reported by our staff. Since the beginning of our cooperation, which was initially marked by the shipment of some cloth for children's clothing, we have entered into consultations with your representatives, first In Paris and later on in Moscow, to see how UNICEF might assist more extensively the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nani in its reconstruction efforts in order to progressively improve the conditions of its children and mothers. I was happy to learn that during the week of their visit to your country, the representatives of UITICEF were able to ireet continually with representatives of the Red Cross and with experts in various fields of concern to children and mothers. This working grcnp, I understand,was able to review not only the general and specific working methods of UNICEF, but also the needs of children and mothers in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, the priorities and approaches dstermined by the authorities concerned to meet these needs, and the stoport from UNICEF which they could find particularly useful and relevant to these approaches. I have also noted the design, form and contents of sush support required in the immediate future, notably for the year 1973, ia the fields of health and education, involving the procurement of drags, medical supplies and hospital equipment, as well as teaching aids for education. The list of requirements, which the UNICEF delegation submitted to me as your concrete proposals for 1973, will serve as a basis for immediate action for which I have given my\" agreement, subject to technical exami- nation and clarification on some, items, their availability and appro- priateness for IMICEF assistance. The services of UMCEF will begin shipment of available items as quickly as shipping arrangements can be made, and will undertake procurement action on such oiher items, as the- technical examination shall indicate are available anS suitable. , .. ._. The UNICEF action will also include, if possible^ answers to speci- fic requests for information on such masters as -che EEST; suitable reaching* aids, including the types of blackboards needed. Our services will also-M be in touch -with yours to ensure that the technical specification of available materials conform with the specific needs cff the services and programmes concerned. _ . I believe you know that, while UNICEF already has- some modest re- sources available for assistance, its ability to extend substantial aid to your country will depend on the financial resources to be made available to it on a multinational basis, from governmental and non- governmental resources. I can report that I have already initiated a series of renuests to governments that may be interested in making contributions. In addition to the proposals for 1975 action, I lave also noted that a more general review has undertaken, during the visit of our delegation, concerning childrens' needs and programmes which may renuire UNICEF assistance and cooperation in 197^. I understand that such assistance would be related to activities under the direction of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and the Committee for the Protection of Mothers and Children. The tentative list of re-uirementsfor 197^-5 which was brought back by Mr. 5andberg and Mr. Beaumont, will be studied as soon as possible by UNICEF. We will later communicate certain general and specific suggestions which could serve as a basis for further joint consultation of UHTCEF with the Red Cross and experts of technical ministries in Hanoi aiming at a mutual determination of a final programme of cooperation for 197^\u00ab ' * I am also informed that the group discussed in Sanoi a certain number of practical questions concerning future communications between us, arrangements for shipping, the handling of supplies and e\"uipment, identification markings, as well as mutual financial responsibility. I understand that, at this stage of our cooperation, the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been authorized by the*r Government to discuss with UHICEF its programme of aid, to receive, acknowledge and take responsibility for the distribution of supplies and equipment made available by UNICEF, maintain records of their final use and provide necessary information, and to do so in relation with the technical services interested in the different aspects of this programme, namely in the fields of health, education, protection of the 'mother and child and poccibly others. As also discussed in Hanoi, I confirm that officially designated representatives of lEHCEF will be made available to the Government as and when'mutually agreed. They will be directly responsible for working with you on all matters pertaining to the planning and im- plementation of UNICEF aid to the Democratic Republic and will be ready to visit your country again when and as advisable. In closing, let me say that I am very happy that we have been able to take these first steps toward a cooperative prograrsme of benefit to the children of the Democratic Republic of -Yiet-lTam. I am convinced that as a result of the experience in providing assistance in 1973, the cooperation of UMTCE? with your country will develop and contribute to serve the needs of mothers and children in the longer period, of reconstruction, Accept, Sir, the assurance of r-:j highest consideration.

NEW YORK IPLG-39/73 23 July 1973 Dear Mr. Secretary General, Please, find attached herewith the text of the letter presently addressed by Mr. Henry R. Labouisse, Executive Director of UNICEF, to 15 governments (list enclosed) requesting of those governments special advance contributions toward the Indochina programme, for the amount of US$2.5 to US$3 million \"to help carry out existing and possibly expanded programmes in the Republic of Vietnam, in Laos and in the Khmer Republic and also to meet some of the immediate needs of children and mothers in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and in territory controlled by the PRG.\" Paragraph 1O of the letter states: \"In considering the present request, your Government might wish to know that, while UNICEF has acted in this matter on the basis of its own mandate and with the approval of its Executive Board, \"I have kept Secretary General Waldheim regularly and fully informed. He supports our line of action. \"I should also tell you that I am not, at this time, making a general or public appeal for funds, but I am simply approaching a limited number of governments that I feel may be willing to consider making special contributions, some of whom have already expressed their interest to me.\" Yours sincerely, Mr. Kurt Waldheim Secretary General United Nations New YorkJacques Beaumont Indochin Peninsula Liaison GroupLetter addressed from Mr. Henry R. Labouisse Executive Director of UNICES1 to 15 Governments Sir; 1) I have the honour to inform you of the current situation with respect to possibilities for UNICEF. assistance to children and mothers in the Indo-China Peninsula. 2) It may be useful to recall that the UHICEF Executive Board at its May 1973 session, adopted my recommendation whereby it approved a commitment of US Dollars 3 Million from UHICEF'S general resources to \"permit the continuation of present assistance and the possibilities of some expansion\". The Board also authorized me to receive and expend special contributions which might be made to UHICEF for enlarged programmes of assistance in the area. It ::~.z understood that such special contributions would be used for the benefit of children and mothers wherever possible in the Indo-China Peninsula, in addition to those specific programmes foreseen in the commitment of US Dollars 3 Million to be financed from our general resources. A tentative estimate of total requirements submitted to the Board indicated that, for 1973/T1^, UHICEF assistance could be of the order of US Dollars. 3 Million. (A copy of the recommendation, E/ICEF/P.L.1592 of 1? April 1973, is attached). 3) UHICEF ongoing programmes in the Republic, of Viet-Ham, the KHMER Republic and Laos described briefly in P.L.1592, are now being reviewed to determine how they can best be enlarged to meet the needs of children and mothers in a changing situation, both currently and for the longer term. In addition, one Government in Europe has offered a substantial special contribution, subject to the resolution of certain technical questions, in order to expand a programme of clean drinking water in rural areas of the Republic of Viet-Nam. Work on the development of larger and long-range reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes will go forward as rapidly as possible. Measures are being taken to strengthen UHICEF1S representation in Saigon, Vientiane and Phnom Penh.- 2. - X ^) With regard to assistance to children and mothers in the Demo- cratic Republic of Viet-Nam, I can report that, following extensive correspondence intended to provide information on TMTCEF and its methods of operation, two senior members of the IMICEF staff recently . went to Hanoi at the invitation of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Ham. They spent a week (30 June to 7 July) there, visited some areas outside of Hanoi, saw some of the activities in the fields of health and education, noted some of the areas of need where UEttCEF could be helpful, and held intensive discussions with senior officials of the Red Cross and officials of the Government. The Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Viet- Nam had been authorized by the Government to discuss with UTHCEF possible programmes of aid and to receive^ acknowledge and take responsibility for the distribution of supplies and equipment that may be provided by UKICEF. It was understood that this would be done in relation with the technical services concerned in such fields as health, education and the protection of mother and child. 5) After an examination in some depth of the needs of children and mothers, and of the methods of meeting these needs being followed or planned by the Government services, there emerged, an identification of& those programmes which, specifically in the fields of health and education, most urgently required IMICEF assistance in 1973 The country has an extensive network of public health services at the provincial, district and village levels. A number of the centres and referral hospitals were destroyed or damaged during the war, and the system as a whole suffers from an acute shortage of essential supplies and drugs. The Government is undertaking the, task -of physical reconstruction and rehabilitation of the health network. IMICEF has been asked for carefully selected items of supplies and equipment for the field health services for mothers and children, particularly for those areas of the country that were most affected by war damages. Similarly, the Government is also proceeding with'reconstruction of school buildings in a national educational system which provides the beginnings of elementary education for some one point two million children in the age bracket three and one half to seven and provides teaching for some four point'eight million students in three regular levels of general education. The most acute need in the schools, as well as in the teacher training institutions, is for- 3 - teaching aids of even the simplest kind and the initial request to UNICEF is for a substantial supply of blackboards. The lists of supplies, notably those in the health field, are now receiving careful technical scrutiny with a view to determining availability as -well as suitability for UNICEF assistance. It is, however, already clear that the total value of the drugs and medical supplies and of the education equipment needed by an urgent basis for 1973? will be in the range of US dollars 1.5 - US dollars 2 Million. 6) With regard to long-term reconstruction and rehabilitation re- quirements, our staff also discussed this subject with officials of the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Viet-lTam and received from them a preliminary indication of needs in 197^ These will be examined carefully 'following which it is anticipated that our staff members will again visit Hanoi at a date to be mutually agreed. Probably in the early fall.' At that time it is expected that a programme of broader dimensions and longer duration can be drawn up on the basis of needs (as it will then be possible to foresee them) and on the basis of advice which our eT;ja-P-p *-r<** 7) While in Hanoi, our staff were contacted by representatives of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South\"Viet-Ham (PRG) and received from them information concerning the situation of children and mothers in territories under control of the PRG as well as a pre- liminary list of medical supplies and equipment, and other supplies (such as cloth for children's clothing) stated to be -urgently needed. This list is now being reviewed for availability of the items and their suitability for UHICE? assistance. We are also discussing the the matter, including modalities of aid, with officials'of the Indo-China operational group of the Red Cross in Geneva, who currently are discussing and im- plementing programmes of assistance to the PRG. Taking the above factors into account, it would appear that, on an emergency basis and pending further discussions and consideration of ways of helping to meet longer- range needs, assistance from UJHCEF in the order of some US Dollars 1*00,000 to US Dollars 500,000 might be appropriate in the next few months, possibly in conduction with programmes of the Red Cross.-u- 8) To sum up, UNICEF currently needs, in addition to the US dollar 5 Million from our general resources committed by the Executive Board (Reference to in the second paragraph of this letter),, some US dollar 2.5 Million to US dollar 3 Million in order to help carry'but existing and possibly expanded programmes in the Republic of THfet-Nam, in Laos and in. the KHMER - (KYMER) Republic and also tOTBset some of the immediate needs of children and mothers in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and in territory controlled by the PEG.\" I ^iall be most grateful if your Government will give urgent consideration to the pos-, sibility of making a special contribution to UNICEF fmtr these purposes. 9) At a later date, towards end of the year, I lope to be able to-<\"give you more comprehensive programmes of proposed UM3EEF assistance for_. reconstruction and rehabilitation in most, if not all^ areas of the Indo- China Peninsula. These would be based on further discussions with the several authorities concerned and a careful review by my staff, and would be in accordance with the line of action foreseei in the attached document P.L/1592. At the present time I have no reason to make any substantial revisions in .the broad estimates contained, in that document of possible reiuirements for such UNICEF assistance. The precise amounts which will be needed will, of course, depend on develspnents in the situation which cannot all be foreseen now. There may also be variations in the time periods for which separate programmes can\"&e prepared. However, for planning purposes, the order of magnitude of required resources remains at approximately US Dollars 30 MilUfon. It would, of course, help greatly in preparing our programmes, iif your Government, in addition to any contribution it can make to help us meet the immediate requirements of US Dollars 2.5 Million to US Dollars J, Million mentioned in paragraph 8 above, could contribute or pledge an anount towards these larger programmes on the understanding that additional, supporting information will be provided as soon as possible. At the appropriate time, I should also be glad to arrange a meeting of representatives of interested donor Governments. 10) In considering tte present re-uest, your Government might wish to know that, while UNICEF has acted in this matter OB the basis of its own mandate and with the approval of its Executive Board, I havekept Secretary-General Waldheim regularly and fully informed. He supports our line of action. I should also tell you that I am not, at this time, making a general or public appeal for funds, but I am simply approaching a limited number of Governments that I feel may be/ willing to consider making special contributions some of whom have already expressed their interest to me. Finally, in view of the sensitivity of the situation in the area I would suggest that, if your Government finds it possible to make a contribution, it would be desirable for any publicity to be coordinated with my staff. 11) As I am leaving Geneva shortly, I would suggest that the reply to this letter be sent to my- office, in Hew York, Accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

Ways to help through alternative non-institutional programmes the thousands of homeless and vagrant children in the Republic of Vietnam are now being explored, as well as programmes of nutritional rehabilitation through donated food as well as locally produced protein supplement. In Khmer, a programme of construction of 25 schools including sanitation and clean water supply is being prepared, based on the use of local building materials. Procurement is being undertaken for emeigency requests A- 3 - such as children's beds for hospitals ar.f ^per and exercise boohs for the next school year. In Laos, plans are now being prepared for the rebuilding o.f four rural health centres and of two provincial hospitals where pediatric and maternity wards have been destroyed. Also the extension of UNICEF assistance is envisaged ; /> to the rehabilitation centre for handicaped children, for /W/c-- war and ^eiye-stricken victims, including materials for the manufacture of presthetics. Work on the development of larger and long-range reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes will go forward as rapidly as possible. Measures are being taken to strengthen UNICEF's representation in Saigon, to open in the immediate future an office in Vientiane and, as soon as possible an office in Phnom Penh. 4.

Following the visit of two UNICEF officials to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to Laos and to the Republic of Vietnam (Saigon), a programme of help to the whole of Indochina has been prepared in the line of the Recommendation P/L.1592, adopted unanimously by the UNICEF Board. This first emergency phase which requests an additional 3-4 million dollars over and above the 3 million voted by the UNICEF Board will be followed by a long-term programme of aid for reconstruction in the four countries in the field of children's health, education, protection, requesting an estimate of 27 million dollars. 2. Mr. H. Labouisse is presently sending a letter to a limited number of governments stating the situation concerning the UNICEF programmes of aid for the reconstruction of Indochina in the field of children and is requesting them to finance the emergency phase referred to above. The draft of the letter is attached, it has been somewhat modified in Geneva to give more precisions on programmes actually undertaken in the three countries and the emergency request for DRV and PRG. Paragraph 11 of this letter states: \"in considering the present request, your government might wish to know that, while UNICEF has acted in this matter on the basis of its own mandate and with the approval of its Executive Board, I have kept the Secretary General regularly and fully informed. He supports our line of action. I should also tell you that I am not, at this time, making a general or public appeal for funds, but I am simply approaching a limited number of governments that I feel may be interested...\" 3. The letter will serve as a basis for a report to the Board members of UNICEF, this report will also eventually serve for a press release.Cable received from Mr. H.

THE BOARD ALSO AUTHORIZED ME TO RECEIVE AND EXPEND SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION WHICH MIGHT BE MADE TO UNICEF FOR ENLARGED PROGRAMMES OF ASSISTANCE IN THE AREA. IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT SUCH SPECIAL CONTRIBUTIONS WOULD BE USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF CHILDREN AND MOTHERS WHEREVER POSSIBLE IN THE INDOCHINA PENINSULA, IN ADDITION TO THOSE SPECIFIC PROGRAMMES FORESEEN IN THE COMMITMENT OF USDOL 3 MILLION TO BE FINANCED FROM OUR GENERAL RESOURCES.

THEY SPENT A WEEK (3O JUNE TO 6 JULY) THERE, VISITED SOME AREAS OUTSIDE OF HANOI, SAW SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELDS OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION, NOTED SOME OF THE AREAS OF NEED WHERE UNICEF COULD BE HELPFUL, AND HELD INTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE RED CROSS AND OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE RED CROSS OF THE DRV HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO DISCUSS WITH UNICEF ITS POSSIBLE PROGRAMMES OF AID AND TO RECEIVE, ACKNOWLEDGE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT THAT MAY BE PROVIDED BY UNICEF. IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS WOULD BE DONE IN RELATION WITH THE TECHNICAL MINISTRIES CONCERNED IN SUCH FIELDS AS HEALTH, EDUCATION AND THE PROTECTION OF MOTHER AND CHILD.\u2014 3 \u2014 5) AFTER EXAMINATION IN SOME \"'DEPTH OF THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND MOTHERS/ Ai:D OF THE METHODS OF MEETING THESE NEEDS ESING FOLLOWED OR PLAINED EV THE GOVERNMENT SERVICES/ THERE EMERGED AL\\ IDENTIFICATION OF THOSE PROGRAMMES WHICH, SPECIFICALLY IN THE FIELDS OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION/ MOST URGENTLY REQUIRED U1TICEF ASSISTANCE IN 1973.

THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDERTAKING THE TASK OF PHYSICAL RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION OF THE HEALTH NETWORK, AND HAS TURNED TO UNICEF FOR CAREFULLY SELECTED ITEMS OF SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE FIELD OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN/ PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY THAT WERE-MOST AFFECTED BY WAR DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO PROCEEDING WITH RECONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS IN A NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES TEACHING FOR SOME 1.2 MILLION CHILDREN IN THE PRE-SCHOOLAGE AND 4.8 MILLION STUDENTS IN THREE LEVELS OF GENERAL EDUCATION. THE MOST ACUTE NEED IN THE SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS IN THE TEACHER TRAINING INSTITUTIONS/ IS FOR TEACHING AIDS OF EVEN THE SIMPLEST KIND/ AND THE INITIAL REQUEST TO UNICEF IS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL SUPPLY OF CHALK BOARD. THE LISTS OF SUPPLIES/ NOTABLY THOSE IN THE HEALTH FIELD/ ARE NOW RECEIVING CAREFUL TECHNICAL SCRUTINY WITH A VIEW TO DETERMINING AVAILABILITY AS WELL AS SUITABILITY FOR UNICEF ASSISTANCE. IT IS/ HOWEVER, ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE DRUGS AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND OF THE EDUCATION EQUIPMENT NEEDED ON AN URGENT BASIS FOR 1973, WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF USDOL 1.5 - USDOL 2 MILLION._ 4 - 6) WHILE IN HANOI, OUR STAFF ALSO HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFICIALS OF THE PROVISIONAL REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT OF SOUTH VIETNAM (PRG) , AND RECEIVED FROM THEM INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SITUATION OF CHILDREN Al\u00a9 MOTHERS IN TERRITORIES UNDER CONTROL OF THE PRG J.S WELL AS A PRELIMINARY LIST OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES AlB EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER SUPPLIES (SUCH AS CLOTH FOR CHILDREN 'S CLOTHING) STATED TO BE URGENTLY NEEDED. A PRELIMINARY COSTING OF THESE ITEMS INDICATES THAT, TAKING ACCOUNT ALSO OF AVAILIBILI'TY AND SUITABILITY FOR UNICSF ASSISTANCE, IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE FOR UNICEF TO MAKE TJENTATIVE PROVISION - PENDING FURTHER REVIEW AND CONSIDERATION - FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IN THE RANGE OF TSDOL 3OO,OOO TO USDOL 400,000.Letter addressed from Mr. Henry R. Labouisse, Executive Director of UNICEF TO Doctor Nguyen Van Tin, Vice President, DRV Red Cross. Dear Mr. Vice-President, s I am. writing to express on behalf of UNICEF my -thanks for the way the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnan and the Red Cross have received two of our senior staff, Mr. Martin Sandberg and Mr. Jacques Beaumont. They have both told me of the warm welcome and, courtesies extended to them on this their first visit to your country. I have had also a full report from them on the discussions held in Hanoi4from 50 June to 7 July 1973- These discussions were for the purpose of.seeking a basis for cooperation between your country and UNICEF and,' more specifically, to identify concrete ways in which UNICEF might provide support and assistance to programmes for the benefit of children and mothers in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam in such fields as health and education. I have been impressed by the friendly spirit of mutual cooperation in which these discussions were held, as reported by our staff. Since the beginning of our cooperation, which wss initially marked by the shipment of some cloth for children's clothing, we have entered into consultations with your representatives, first in Paris and later on in Moscow, to see how UNICEF might assist more expensively the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam in its reconstruction' efforts in order to progressively improve the conditions of its children and mothers. I was happy to learn that during the week of their visit to your country, the representatives of UNIC3F were able to meet continually with representatives of the Red Cross and with experts in various fields of concern to children and mothers. This working grcup, I understand,was able to review not only the general and specific vrorking methods of UNICEF, but also the needs of children and mothers in the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, the priorities and approaches determined by the authorities concerned to meet these needs, and the support from UNICEF which they could find particularly useful and- relevant to these apiQroaches. I have also noted the design, form and contents of srch support required in the immediate future, notably for the year 1973, 3s the fields of health and education, involving the procurement of drags, medical supplies and hospital equipment, as well as teaching aids for education. The list of requirements, which the UNICEF delegation submitted to me as your concrete proposals for 1973j will serve as a basis for immediate action for which I have given my\" agreement, subject to technical exami- nation and clarification on some, items, their availability and appro- priateness for UNICEF assistance. The services of UMCEF will begin shipment of available items as quickly as shipping arrangements can be made, and will undertake procurement action on such oiher items,as the technical examination shall indicate are available anS suitable. The UNICEF action will also include, if possible, answers to speci- fic requests for information on such masters as the most suitable teaching4 aids, including the types of blackboards needed. Our services will also be in touch with yours to ensure that the technical specification of available materials conform with the specific needs of the services and programmes concerned. ' _ I believe you know that, while UNICEF already has some modest re- sources available for assistance, its ability to exterd substantial aid to your country will depend on the financial resources to be made available to it on a multinational basis, from governmental and non- governmental resources. I can report that I have already initiated a series of renuests to governments that may be interested in making contributions-. In addition to the proposals for 1973 action, I \"have also noted that a more general review has undertaken, during the visit of our delegation, concerning childrens1 needs and programmes which may require U1TICEF assistance and cooperation in 197^- I understand that such assistance would be related to activities under the direction of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and the Committee for the Protection of Mothers and Children. The tentative list of re-uirementsfor 197^, which was brought back by Mr. Sandberg and Mr. Beaumont, will be studied as soon as possible by UNICEF. We will later communicate certain general and specific suggestions which could serve as a basis for further joint consultation of UNICEF with the ReS Cross and experts of technical ministries in Hanoi aiming at a mutual determination of a final programme of cooperation for 197** ' * I am also informed that the group discussed in Eanoi a certain number of practical questions concerning future communications between us, arrangements for shipping, the handling of supplies and equipment, identification markings, as well as mutual financial responsibility. I understand that, at this stage, of our cooperation, the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been authorized by the* Government to discuss with UNICEF its programme of aid, to receive, acknowledge and take responsibility for the distribution of supplies and equipment made available by UNICEF, maintain records of their final use and provide necessary information, and to So so in relation with the technical services interested in the different aspects of this programme, namely in the fields of health, education, protection of the \"mother and child and possibly others.* As also discussed in Hanoi, I confirm that officially designated representatives of UHICEF will be made available to the Government as and when mutually agreed. They will be directly responsible fo.r working with you on all matters pertaining to the planning and im- plementation of UNTCSF aid to the Democratic Republic and will be ready to visit your country again when and as advisable. In closing, let me say that I am very happy that we have been able to take these first steps toward a cooperative programme of benefit to the children of the Democratic Republic of -Viet-lTasi. I am convinced that as a result of the experience in providing assistance in 1973, the cooperation of UICECE7 with your country will develop and contribute to serve the needs of mothers and children in the longer period, of reconstruction, Accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

LIMITED E/ICEF/P/L.1592 13 April 1973 ORIGINAL: Zi::-II3H Relief and rehabilitation measures for mothers and, children in the Indochina Peninsula Recommendation by the Executive Director Summary Early discussicns in the Executive Board have made clear that UNICEF, in conformity with its terms of reference and its record of humanitarian assistance to children without any discrimination on account of the political beliefs cf their parents, would be ready to assist and co-operate in programmes for the benefit of children thoughout the Indochina Peninsula. UNICEF has for many years been assisting children's projects in the Republic of Viet-Nam, the Khmer Republic and.Laos. As a result of arrangements made through the League'of Red Cross Societies with the Red Cross Society of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, UNICEF has supplied a quantity of cotton cloth for the making of children's clothing in the Democratic Republic. In the hope that the cease-fire agreement and the peace conference have created conditions in which aid for relief and rehabilitation of children's services could be given in a wider area and on a larger scale, UNICEF staff have recently been in touch with Government authorities in the Republic of Viet-Nam, in Laos and the Khmer Republic, and aide-memoires and accompanying explanatory information have been given to the Missions in Paris of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of thp Republic of South Viet-Nam. The latter contacts continue at this time; there has not yet been time for replies to 1e given. A* this stage, full information is not available about the extent of children's needs ncr the wishes of Governments in Indcchina about UITICEF cc-opera~icn, and the =.7.:ur.t cf resources that may be contributed is unknown. Seme preparatory steps have ceen taken and a review of the fields of UNICEF assistance that could be appropriate indicates that for 1973-197!; this could be of the order of $30,000,000. At present the Executive Director recommends an initial commitment of funds and also t?,e appro^ral of the acceptance and use of special contributions, \"r.e Executive Director recommends that the Executive Board approves (a) a commitment of $3,000,000 from UNICEF's general resources and (b) authorizes the expenditure cf special contributions to UNICEF, whether paid directly to it or channelled through any appeal launched by the United Nations.NATIONS UJX UNIES POUR L'ESFAIiCE Comite du programs Session de 1973 Me sure s de seco'irs et 3 3 re construction en^ favour des Directeur general Resume II ressort des discussions anterieures qui ont eu lieu au Conseil d'admi- nistration que, conformement a son tnandat pret a foxirnir son assistance et a cooperer en Laos. la d'arrangements conclus par 1'intenaecLiaire de la Ligue des societes de la Croix-Eouge avec la Societe de la Croix-Rouge de la Republique democratioue du Viet-Nam, et la conference de paix perniettront d'etendre la portee et le volume de 1'aide pour des mesures de secours et pour l'a:nenagement de services en faveur des enfants, le personnel du a pouvoirs de revolutionnaire provisoire de la Republique du Viet-IIam du Sud a Paris.

The other annexes, 1,2, 3 and 5, are identical to those en- closed with my letter to you of today's date concerning North Vietnam. When my representatives delivered the aide-memoire to the Head of the PRG Mission in Paris on March 22, the latter expressed an interest in possible immediate emergency aid as well as longer-term assistance. He indicated that there would be an early official reply from his government. This has not as yet been received.

NEW YORK 1 June 1973 Dear Mr. Secretary-General: UNICEF Contacts with Representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Pursuant to our conversation of 30 May, I am enclos- ing herewith a copy of my letter of 18 May 1973 to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam., with its enclosures: Annex 1\u2014The text of my recommendation of April 13 to my Executive Board, which was approved during the meeting which ended on May 14. Annex 2\u2014List of the members of the UNICEF Executive Board. (Annex 3 is not enclosed. It is summarized in the letter.) Annex 4\u2014Two aides-memoires dated March 26 and March 30, respectively, with covering letters. Annex 5\u2014Document entitled \"Formes et Modalites de Cooperation de I1UNICEF\". When my representatives first sought to approach the Mission of the DRV in Paris in late March, they were advised that the Mission did not deal with aid matters and that we should communicate directly with the \"Comite pour la Reception et la Distribution de I1Aide Internationale et Populaire\", which had just been established in Hanoi. H.E. Dr. Kurt Waldheim The Secretary-General United Nations, New York 10017UNITED NATIONS CHILDREN'S FUND 1M? FONDS DES NATIONS UNIES POUR L'ENFANCE - 2 - Accordingly, the first aide-memoire (that of March 26) was sent with the covering letter of one of my deputies, Charles Egger, directly to the president of the committee in Hanoi. I was not satisfied with this procedure and felt it important to try to establish a more direct contact with the govern- mental authorities. Accordingly, one of my representatives arranged to talk with the head and one other official of the DRV Mission in Paris, who then agreed to accept and to forward to Hanoi the second aide-memoire and my covering letter of March 30. Following my Executive Board meeting and approval of the recommendations, I addressed the letter of May 18 to the Foreign Minister of the DRV and had it delivered on May 25, together with the enclosures listed above, to the DRV Mission in Paris for on-forwarding. When delivering this letter, my representatives were informed orally that the government of the DRV had responded positively to our previous proposals (those contained in the aides-memoires) and agreed to receive UNICEF aid. The DRV representative in Paris then went on to propose that UNICEF make contact with the Notth Vietnamese Red Cross through the intermediary of the DRV Embassy in Moscow. As I mentioned to you in our conversation, I do not con- sider this a satisfactory method of procedure. Accordingly, I am instructing my representative in Paris to proceed to Moscow (which he is planning to do in connection with another matter) and to seek to obtain, through the DRV Embassy there, agreement for two UNICEF representatives to visit Hanoi for discussions on the spot. A request will be made for visas for the two men for delivery through the DRV representation in Vientiane, where the officers will be in the latter half of June.UNITED NATIONS CHILDREN'S FUND FONDS DES NATIONS UNIES POUR L'ENFANCE - 3 - I have no means of knowing what the DRV reaction will be to my letter of May 18 nor to the request for visas to be made through the Embassy in Moscow.

Yours sincerely, \u00a5ilfred Jenks, Director-General. Mr. Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General, United Nations, 33E\u00a5 YORK, I.Y. 10017MEMORANDUM UN Contribution to Post Cease-Fire Reconstruction Activities in Viet-Nam The ILO1s Role The ILO could provide assistance to Viet-Nam, on request, in the following major areas: 1. Vocational Rehabilitation of the Disabled The ILO, in co-operation with WHO and other \"bodies concerned, could initiate regional programmes for the vocational rehabilita- tion of the disabled with a series of vocational centres linked with medical rehabilitation centres, hospitals and clinics, and providing vocational rehabilitation as well as serving as a base for the training of vocational rehabilitation instructors. 2. Vocational Preparation of Adolescents and Young People separated from their Families The ILO, in co-operation with UNESCO, TJNICEF and other competent UN Agencies, could assist in the development of a series of pilot vocational centres for adolescents and young people (aged roughly 12-18 years), aimed at giving them simple, practical skill training for work useful to their communities in sectors in which future opportunities would be likely to be avail- able. These centres could cater in particular for the very large number of young people who have become orphans or separated from their families and who require to be economically self-supporting at a young age. 3- Vocational Preparation of Girls and Women who have to carry family responsibilities alone The ILO, in co-operation with FAO (home economics) and UNESCO (literacy), could assist in the development of programmes for the vocational preparation of girls and women whose husbands have been killed or disabled or who have been abandoned and who must now carry family responsibilities alone.2. 4. Resettlement of the Homeless A massive relief operation and the resettlement of homeless families would call for the construction of low-cost temporary as well as permanent houses. Roadbuilding, repair and mainten- ance, and work on other forms of transport could lead from the relief phase of activities into the construction and development phase. The ILO's contribution would \"be in providing iraining and assisting in the establishment of schemes to implement programmes in these fields. The areas listed above have an immediate humanitarian aspect, and programmes in these areas could be instituted in the first phase of\" activities dealing with relief and rehabilitation. Longer-term policies covering the reconstruction and development phases could include the following fields: (1) Manpower Organisation Forecasting The ILO could assist in the development of plans for the efficient utilisation and development of national human resources and for the forecasting of short and medium-term manpower requirements so as to prepare the ground gradually and rationally for training geared to employment requirements. (2) Vocational Training for Reconstruction As a result of the devastating destruction inflicted by the long hostilities, particular attention should be paid to the development of human resources. The ILO, with its long experience in the field of vocational train- ing, could initiate and supervise work-oriented accelerated vocational training for key personnel in construction, transport and communications and for repair of physical damage to roads, transport and buildings. The programme has the immediate objective of providing the country as soon as possible with the skilled labour force required. In the subsequent stages, this activity could be enlarged to provide assistance for the establishment of a comprehensive vocational training scheme on a country-wide basis, including the establishment of appropriate technical standards and the establishment of an appropriate number of training facilities.Handicrafts and Small-Scale Industries While the public works and emergency schemes referred to above will absorb a large number of the labour force, there will nevertheless be a need for involving people' in productive and remunerative activities and the promotion of handicrafts of the traditional, artistic, utilitarian or servicing craft type could contribute to the creation of jobs. The ILO could assist in setting up and reactivating these activities and in ensuring them the infrastructure they need as regards raw materials, credit, technical standards, supervision and marketing. In this respect, the setting up of production and marketing co-operatives could play a very important role to ensure the maximum benefit of such efforts wiH go to the people concerned and would avoid any exploitation that might occur if this process were left in the hands of middlemen. The ILO has been successful in promoting and building up such institutions in many developing countries.WORLD1 METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION OFFICE OF GENEVE, 16 April 1973 tc.

It seems, however, | that under U.S. Aid Programmes, many more fellowships have j been provided. 2. From available information it appears that a reasonable network of meteorological observing stations with good communication facilities has been built up in South Vietnam. Although it may be expected that the equipment will be handed to the Vietnamese after departure of the United States forces, it is not known whether the network can continue to be efficiently operated. It seems likely that the United States Aid will continue to be provided to the Meteorological Service of the Republic of Vietnam. The Country Programme Proposals for UNDP assistance for the next four years, which will be submitted to the Governing Council in June 1973, do not include any assistance in the field of meteorology in view I of the wide scope of the United States Aid Programme, which, 1 according to the documents, \"has largely satisfied the needs ,! of Vietnam\". 3. Very little is known of the Meteorological Service of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It seems likely '] that in North Vietnam a network of meteorological stations } is in operation to meet military^-and other requirements.ji j 4. The assistance being given by UNDP in the develop- j ment of the Lower Mekong Basin is substantial and well-known. \\ The responsible body is the Committee for Coordination of j Investigations of the Lower Mekong Basin which was set up in .j ' 1957 under the aegis of ECAFE. L| 5. The Committee collaborates closely with the j Meteorological Services of the riparian countries, in particular I with the Thai Meteorological Department, which supply the j Mekong Secretariat regularly with rainfall, evaporation and i hydrological data, and even radar and meteorological satellite i data. With the help of these data, flood forecasts forselected river basins are being prepared which are issued for five days ahead on an experimental basis during the flood season (July to October). Possible areas of future WMO assistance 6. The devastation caused in North and South Vietnam by typhoons and the floods which may accompany them and which also occur in other circumstances, is too well-known to stress. A field of interest to WMO is that of organizing warning systems for typhoons and for flood forecasting. It is estimated that the installation of two weather radar stations for typhoon detection would be needed. These would cost about $500,000. For the same purpose two stations for direct reading of satellite data should be installed. The cost for both would be $70,000. 7. For flood forecasting purposes, the network of streamflow and rainfall stations will have to be expanded, .including where possible some automatic water stage recorders and telemetering rainfall stations. The Song Cai River basin on the East coast of South Vietnam was under consideration for a pilot flood forecasting project after a December 1964 flood of the river resulted in 150 deaths and inundation of the city of Phan Rang. The cost of a network of about 6-8 telemetering stations for one river basin would be about $60,000 and an additional $40,000 x\u00abrould be necessary for repeater stations. The total cost for the network is thus estimated at $100,000. 8. After the termination of hostilities, agriculture is likely to figure as one of the-prominent areas to be developed by the Government of both North and South Vietnam. It is necessary that meteorological services to agriculture be developed in conjunction with this effort and that a network of agrometeorological stations be set up. Climatological data processing facilities may have to be modernized to facilitate agrometeorological investigations as well as to enable studies of other applications of meteorology to economic development. The estimated cost would be about $200,000. 9. All these activities would be dependent to a greater or less extent upon the basic network of meteorological observing stations to be established. For both North and South Vietnam there will be a requirement for about 25-3O synoptic stations. Depending on whether or not remote read- ing wind measuring equipment is required, the cost of one, -\u00bb _ -5.i J \" synoptic station is $2,500 or 3,500.. Some four or five of these should be capable of taking upper-air observations; wind-finding radar equipment is recommended (cost .$60,000 each) The observations need to be sent to a designated collecting centre; equipping each station with a SSB transceiver would be desirable (cost about $2,000-2,500 per station including an electric generator). The national collecting centres should be equipped with radio transmitters and receivers for the onward transmission of the national data and the receipt of international broadcasts (cost $80,000, including facsimile) . This whole system needs to be supported by .- an instruments workshop and adequately trained technicicans (cost of a workshop about $40,OOO). -The total cost would thus 'be about $570,000.* 1O. The proposals outlined above will require adequately trained personnel. It is therefore suggested that in any project a sufficient number of fellowships be included in the fields of typhoon .forecasting, network inspection and meteorological instruments repair and calibration, telecommunica- tion engineering and operation, agrometeorology and modern methods of climatological data processing and flood forecast- I ing. Training of observers should be done locally, if 5 necessary with the help of an international expert. The 1 cost would be $60,000.j I 11. The total cost of such assistance is thus of the | order of $1,500,000. This is of course a very tentative j estimate. I Priorities^I | 12. Probably the most urgent aspects of the above activities are those relating to the typhoon warning and flood forecasting systems. Any relief operations could be greatly impeded if not nullified by the occurrence of a natural disaster of either kind if a warning system is not in operation.

This could be one more way of bringing to their attention the many-sided effort made by the various bodies of the United Nations in this field under your distinguished leadership. A draft of the covering letter is enclosed. Davidson Nicol His Excellency Dr. Kurt Waldheim Secretary-General United Nations14 March 1973 DRAFT Letter to Ministers of Foreign Affairs who signed the Viet-Nam. Peace Accord. Excellency, I have the honour to present to you with the permission of Dr. Kurt Waldheim our Secretary-General a series of short studies in the field of Peaceful Settlement of Disputes. They have been prepared under the auspices of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research and Research and therefore deal mainly with the instrumentalities of the United Nations including the Office of the Secretary-General and the role of the Security Council. It is an attempt to provide additional support to efforts made by distinguished internationalists like yourself in the furtherance of world peace. Having myself served as a Permanent Representative of my country, Sierra Leone, to the United Nations, and particularly on the Security Council, I am keenly aware of the need for practical, relevant and, wherever possible, brief works on issues of direct concern. I appreciate that, in view of your many preoccupations, it will not be possible for you personally to give your full attention to these studies. I trust, however, that some of them will be of interest to members of your staff and, I hope, provide some contribution to the library of your Ministry.

With the assurances of my highest consideration, Yours sincerely, Faruk N\". Berkol Under-Secretary-General Disaster Relief Co-ordinator Mr. Kurt Waldheim Secretary-General United Nations Hew YorkMote for Mr. Berkol 7 March 1973 At the request of the Co-ordinator, I participated in a meeting called \"by the Indo-China Operational Group (Red Gross) which was held at the I.C.l.G. office on 6 March 1973 at 1600 hours. The following were invited to this meeting: Catholic Relief Services OXFAM ICVA World Council of Churches Lutheran World Federation !3?he International Union for Child Welfare Caritas Internationalis Salvation Army Director General of TOT, Geneva OTICEP UKDRO UHHCR On the Red Cross side, the League and the I.C.R,C. were present, as well as representatives of the Danish Red Cross and the British Red Cross. Mr, Olof Stroh gave a brief report on his recent trip to Indo-China during which nlf'vifxted Hanoi in order to discuss Red Cross programmes. He reported that emergency housing was one of the first priority needs for an estimated popuTati\"6ii\"\"of'\"SBou;t\"\"\"l million, followed by medicines, ambulances, equipment for a 250-bed hospital and simple surgical equipment. The North Viet Ham Government and Red Cross were prepared to accept help from various sources including voluntary agencies. They indicated that they would have no objection to such help being channelled through the Indo-China Operational Group (Red Cross). \" Mr. Stroh also met representatives of GRTIHK and during the discussions they expressed their gratitude for the concern shown by the outside world. There were still some political difficulties. He also met representatives of Pathet-Lao but the meeting was not very interesting as the cease-fire had just been signed. He reported on Red Cross plans and general operations in Indo-China and stressed the acute need for tracing services for the displaced populations in Indo-China as a whole. This tracing service is being operated by the International Red Cross and by some national societies but there are difficulties in covering the whole region of Indo-China. We were briefed by Mr. Stroh on the ongoing and additional special projects which consist at present as follows: Democratic Republic of Viet Mam First Priority - 10,000 prefabricated houses Second Priority - Ambulances, medicaments, medical equipment, office equipment, equipment for audio-visual language training. 2 - Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam First Priority Second Priority Khmer Republic First Priority Second Priority Republic of South Viet Nam First Priority Second Priority Pathet-Lao First Priority Laos First PriorityEquipment for 250-bed hospital Medicaments, medical equipment, egg powder Foodstuffs (rice, condensed or powdered milk, salt, dried fish) Cooking utensils, cloth, cotton blankets, mats, mosquito nets, sarongs Land Rovers One medico-social team, fully equipped Improvement of hygienic installations in Pnom-Penh refugee camps Occupational therapies and equipment for national rehabilitation centre Foodstuffs (rice, condensed or powdered milk, Nucnam (fish sauce), salt, tinned food) Cooking utensils, cloth, cotton blankets,mats, mosquito nets Volkswagen buses or Land Rovers Ambul 3J3.ce s Tents, soap Housing facilities for 170 families under medical treatment 20 provincial medical centres, each 60 beds Expansion convalescence Red Cross centre in Saigon 300 tons rice, 50 tons sugar, 50 tons milk powder Medicaments Medicaments, Land Rovers, office equipment. The above represents a general list of needs. Quantities are not yet estimated in a more accurate form. The Indo China Operational Group will finalise their plan of action in the coming days when more information will be available from the field. We were informed that in South Viet Ham there are 175 voluntary agencies active in some way or another. The general nutrition situation is not too bad although there are, of course, pockets of need. The problems which make difficulties are of a logistical nature, of inadequate distribution facilities*, The North Viet Nam Government and Red Cross are not interested in food programmes but would only accept special food for children. The Laos food situation is differentpwfiere\" there is an acute shortage of rice.- 3 - I have known Mr. Stroh for many years during which we have been associated in numerous Red Cross activities. These professional relations have developed in a close and sincere friendship. In a private conversation with Mr. Stroh he informed me confidentially on the attitude of the North Vietnamese when it 1 comes to assistance from multilateral sources. As 31 have indicated in a previous confidential communication dated 6 November 1972 on Indo China, we have to p \"bear in mind that the North Vietnamese are very proud and \"very marked\" and i that they have resisted hardship and sufferings during all the years of the | war therefore, external aid would be welcome but certainly not into any form ; of humanitarian colonialism from countries or inter-agencies and foreign do- gooders. They did makeULt clear to Mr. Stroh that they would prefer, to a certain extent, to deal with and through the Indo China Operational Group\" P*C.

Pointing out that the new framework of peaceful conditions developing in Indo-China presented great opportunities for the development of industry and natural resources in the' Mekong region, U'Nyun appealed to both developing and developed nations to consult-with United Nations bodies,'such as ECAFE, on their assistance plans for the post-war period. U Nyun said: \"These- four Mekong'countries \u2014 Khmer Republic, Laos, Republic of Viet-Nam-and Thailand -\u2014 should be treated'as a whole. \"While political boundaries certainly'eitist.,\" the great Mekong.river links them all.

Authorizes the Director-General, in consultation with the Executive Board, in the event of a cease-fire and peace being restored, to make a preliminary study within the framework of the budget approved for 1973-197^, of ways and- 2 - ' , f# , means by which Unesco may assist, in its future programme, in restoring the cultural heritage, historic sites and monuments, destroyed or damaged in this most tragic long-drawn out war; h. Invites the Director-General to transmit the terms of this resolution to Member States, the United Nations, the Specialized Agencies, and to communication media throughout the world. "}
