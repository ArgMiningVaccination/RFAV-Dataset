Included within this report is a compr ehensive literature review, field data collect ion test plan , and an evaluation of commercially available mitigation technologies related to the transmission of SARS -CoV-2 (\" COVID -19\") in long- term care ( LTC ) environments. Additionally, this report discusse s aerosol testing in an actual LTC facility using the test plan developed herein. Nearly 1.5 million people live in 16,000 nursing homes in the U nited States. As of De c. 20, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified a total of 662,549 confirmed and suspected COVID -19 cases in these and other LTC facilities , resulting in 92,373 deaths . At this time, COVID -19 cases in LTC facilities accounted for only 3% of the U.S. total of 21 million confirmed cases , yet nearly a third of the 350,000 total U.S. deaths. Preliminary studies hav e found little correlation between the quality of care and transmission of COVID-19 in these facilities, suggesting that even the best infection control practices may not be effective in containing the spread of thi s likely airborne disease. As a result, m any LTC facilities have implemented quarantine procedures and other measures to isolate infectious residents from the general population. Unfortunately, most LTC facilities were not designed for airborne infection control, and guidance for retrofitting exi sting LTC spaces for isolation is limited. 1 Literature Review Of the 1.5 million people living in 16,000 U.S. nursing homes, 90% are over 65 years of age and half are 85 years of age or older (Centers for Disease Co ntrol [CDC] 2016). For decades, this vulnerable population has shared air, food, and healthcare in overcrowded settings ideal for the spread of infection. Each year, 2-3 million nursing home infections occur in the United States , resulting in 150,000 hospitalizations, 388,000 deaths, and up to $2 billion in additional healthcare costs (Diaz-Decaro et al. 2018). In 2020, nursing home residents accounted for less than 0.5% of the U.S. population but almost 30% of its COVID-19 deaths. Prior to COVID-19, comparable numbers of nursing home residents died each year from seasonal influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and pneumonia\u2014despite vaccination rates exceeding 80%. Only since COVID -19 have the inadequacies of infection control in nursing homes and other skilled nursing, assisted living, and LTC facilities been brought to the forefront of the public conscious. New infection control strategies must be considered to contain infectious respiratory outbreaks in U.S. nursing homes, including measures to provide temporary airborne isolation capacity in existing facilities. This position is highlighted by the increasing prevalence of respiratory disease in nursing homes, the limited efficacy of vaccines and current infection control practices, and the estimated 5.3 million people who will require nursing home care in the U nited States by 2030 (Montoya et al. 2011). Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 2 Transmission of COVID -19 can occur through direct or indirect contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces ( i.e., \" fomites \") through saliva and respiratory secretions (World Health Organization 2020). Growing evidence suggests COVID-19 may also be transmitted through the air in poorly ventilated spaces by aerosolized or desiccated droplets (i.e., \"droplet nuclei\" ) less than 5 \u00b5m in diameter. Normal breathing and talking have been shown to produce droplets conducive to aerosol transport (Anderson et al. 2020), with the peak concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 appearing in two distinct size ranges : <1.0\u00b5m and >2.5\u00b5m (Zhao et al. 2020). For moderately symptomatic individuals, viral shedding may range from 1.3 x 10 3 copies/m3 of room air for normal breathing to 7.5 x 106 viral copies for frequent coughing. Consistent with these findings, airborne transmission of COVID-19 has been implicated in several super-spreading events where social distancin g, masking, surface disinfection, and other infectious control procedures were observed, further indicating the virus may remain airborne and viable (e.g., infectious) for several hours and over distances greater than 2 m (6 ft). In fact, spatial infection patterns for similar coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus ( MERS -CoV) suggest SARS-CoV- 2 may be capable of traveling more than 30 m and may remain viable much longer once it settles on surfaces or object s. A review of 9,395 nursing homes in 30 states found nearly one-third (31.4%) had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, with an average of 19.8 cases. Larger facilities in urban settings were significantly more likely to hav e a COVID -19 outbreak (p<0.05). COVID-19 outbreaks, however, were not correlated to nursing home quality of care as determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services five -star quality rating system (Abrams et al. 2020). In fact, several peer -revie wed case studies by t he American Ger iatrics Society document very rapid and widely disseminated outbreaks despite visitor exclusion, cessation of communal dining and group activities, regular resident and staff screenings, universal masking, and aggressive social distancing policies (Blackma n et al. 2020). In nearly every case, more than 30% of residents tested positive for COVID-19 within two to three weeks of the first positive test result (Arons et al. 2020; Kimball et al. 2020) despite early adoption of infection prevention and control measures. Of those, nearly one- third ultimately died. As hospitals reach acute care capacity, nursing homes are retaining greater numbers of COVID - 19-infected residents longer (Lynch et al. 2020). Given that transmission of SARS -CoV-2 through the air is sufficiently likely, airborne exposure to the virus should be controlled (ASHRAE 2020). Nursing homes, however, are not designed for airborne infection control, and isolation is difficult to achieve (Miller et al. 2020). Common limitations in existing facilities are the inability to maintain thermal comfort while providing added ventilation air, directional airflow, increased air filtration , and sufficient isolation space to physically separate infectious residents and attend ing staff from the general population.

Neutral air pressure relationship to adjacent areas. 2 Minimum e fficiency reporting value. 3 General in -patient requirement. No recirculation. All room air exhausted directly to outdoors. As defined by ASHRAE Standard 170 (Table 1), airborne infectious isolation requires dedicated heating, ventilating, and air -conditioning (HVAC) systems that pr ovide several room air changes per hour (ACH) to dilute and remove airborne contaminants. Airborne isolation also requires airflow from spaces outside of the isolation zone inward toward spaces within the isolation zone to contain airborne contaminants. By comparison, HVAC systems in most nursing homes do not maintain directional airflow, have significantly fewer room air changes and minimal air filtration , and recirculate air between resident rooms and communal areas. Nursing homes and other LTC facilities may , however, have reserve HVAC capacity to increase air filtration and outdoor air ventilation , especially during milder weather. Nursing homes may further consider the use of room air cleaners with upper-room ultraviolet ( UV) disinfection or high- efficiency particulate air ( HEPA ) filters (Schoen 2020). HEPA filters may also be used to clean recirculated air or air that cannot be exhausted directly to the outdoors, although the use of high- efficiency filters can diminish the amount of air supplied to the room and cause more air to bypass the filter ( National Air Filtration Association 2020). HVAC systems may also be operated longer than would otherwise be required for climate control to enhance the effects of both added ventil ation and filtration. In addition to engineering controls targeting airborne transmission, nursing homes should consider procedural measures as part of infectious isolation or quarantine planning. Such measures may include limits to avoid overcrowding, dedicated isolation staff, restricted access , and limits on resident transport and movement. Additional measures may include dedicated resident bathrooms and confining aerosol generating procedures to resident rooms, preferably negative pressure rooms if possible (ASHE 2020). Included in this report is an annotated bibliography of more than 90 publications related to COVID- 19 and other respiratory diseases in skilled nursing facilities and similar residential care environments ( see Appendix A ). Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 4 2 Test Plan and Results 2.1 Test Plan To evaluate the effectiveness of methods to create temporary airborne isolation spaces in existing LTC facilities, staff from Affiliated Engineers, Inc. converted a residential wing of an actual LTC facility into an experimental isolatio n test space. The expe rimental test space was retrofitted to provide ASHRAE Standard 170 ventilation rates for airborne isolation as well as directional airflow, air filtration , and physical separation (e.g., anterooms). A DNA tracer aerosol was used to simulate the contaminant load from infectious residents and staff. Contaminant concentrations and movement within the experimental test space and to adjacent spaces were then compared to an identical control test space (at the same facility) without airborne isolation modificatio ns. 2.1.1 Test Aerosol The aerosol used to simulate airborne respiratory droplets was a proprietary solution provided by SafeTraces , an environmental health and safety organization specializing in rapid testing solutions for contaminant tracing and sanitation in food, pharma, healthcare, and related industries. The aerosol consisted of a water-soluble blend of DNA- coded particles sized and formulated to simulate desiccated respiratory droplets ( known as droplet nuclei). Such droplets have a mean aerodynamic diame ter of <5 \u00b5m and have been implicated in the airborne transmission of diseases similar to COVID -19 such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. DNA- coded particles released into the LTC environment were then collected by air and surface sampling equipment and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) detection technology. PCR technology can determine the relative concentration of DNA- coded particles within a space and enable test particles to be differentiated from background or ambient particl es. Because each aeros ol solution was formulated with a unique DNA code, particles could be further traced to their source. As a result, DNA- coded particles were simultaneously released and traced from multiple locations within the LTC facility, reducing testing time and disruption to residents and staff. Table 2. Particle S ize Distribution of T racer Aerosol by P article Count 0.3 \u00b5m 0.5 \u00b5m size distribution of the tracer aerosol was analyzed independently at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Clemson University prior to testing. Each release generated approximately 1.5 x 10 3 particles/L of air , or an average of 2.7 x 105 particles total. Tests confirmed that more than 98% of the aerosol by particle count was in the airborne size range of <5 \u00b5m. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 5 2.1.2 Test Spaces Test spaces included one residential wing designated as the control test space and anot her identical wing designated as the experimental test space. Test spaces consisted of an entry foyer, corridor, and six resident rooms, one of which was used as a staff room. Each resident room was approximately 175 ft 2, and the test spaces including resident rooms, corridor, and foyer w ere approximately 1,500 ft2. Testing in the control space was performed under normal operating conditions according to ANSI/ASHRAE/ASHE Standard-170 guidelines. Testing in the experimental space was per formed under modified temporary isolation conditions to include physical separation of the resident wing from the facility, anterooms at the entrance to each resident space (Figure 1), higher ventilation rates, negative (inward) airflow, and HEPA return air filtration. Figur e 1. Experimental isolation test space (1 = controlled entrance, 2 = temporary anterooms) Photo by Phil Arnold, SafeTraces Resident rooms in the control test space were conditioned with +75 cubic feet per minute (cfm ) of supply air, -10 cfm of return air, and -65 cfm of bathroom exhaust, producing three total air changes per hour (TACH) and a neutral air pressure relationship with the corridor (Figure 2). Modified resident rooms in the experimental test space were conditioned with +220 cfm of supply air, -240 cfm of return air, and -80 cfm of bathroom exhaust, producing 12 TACH and a negative air pressure relationship with the corridor (Figure 3). 1 2Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 6 2.1.3 Test Protocol A total of four tests were conducted \u2014two in the control test space and two in the experimental test space. For e ach space, one test was conducted at 30% outside air and another at 100% outside air. For each test, approximately 10-12 mL of DNA- coded tracer aerosol was released from four locations: two resident rooms, a staff room, and the central corr idor. For each test, air filter samples (9 L/min) were collected at a total of 12 locations : seven locations within the isolation test space, three in adjacent spaces outside of the test space, and one each in the supply and return air duct. The duration of each test from aerosol release to cessation of sampling was approximately 40 minutes. For all tests, doors remained closed for the duration of testing. Table 3.

Control test space airflow configuration Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 7 Figure 3. Experimental test space airflow configuration 2.2 Results To evaluate the ef fectiveness of temporary isolation in LTC facilities, we analyzed the effects of ventilation, directional airflow , and physical airflow barriers on the concentration and containment of the tracer aerosol with respect to resident rooms and adjacent spaces. For each test, PCR analys is was used to produce a DNA tracer reduction log 10 value for each of the 12 sample locations in each test space. Based on these values, the relative concentration of DNA tracer aerosol was determined for each sample location. \" Heat maps \" were then created to observe the effects of ventilation, directional airflow, and physical airflow barriers on the spatial distribution of the tracer aerosol from each of the four aerosol release points in each test space. Heat maps for all tests , including a total of 16 aerosol release points and 48 sample locations, are provided in Appendix B. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 8 Figure 4. Example heat map showing corridor aerosol release (control test space at 1 outdoor air change per hour [ OACH ] and 3 TACH) . SP = sample location s, OP = aerosol release point . From this data, we evaluated seven environmental transmission scenarios in greater detail: Resident room contaminant load Resident room transmission to corridor Corridor transmission to resident rooms Resident room transmiss ion to staff room Isolation zone transmission to common areas* Isolation zone transmission to HVAC syst ems* Room recovery.* * sample locations outside of test space 2.2.1 Resident Room Contaminant Load To evaluate the effect of ventilation on contaminant load within resident rooms and to assess exposure risks to attending healthcare workers, DNA tracer aerosol wa s released inside resident rooms 1 and 2 and sampled under four different air change rates. For each test, tracer aerosol was released at the head of the resident room bed toward the opposite corner of the room at a height Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 9 of 0.8 m (30 in.) above the floor. DNA tracer samples were then collected for 40 minutes at two locations in each resident room, one each at the foot of the bed and between the bed and bathroom at a height of 0.8 m (30 in.) above the floor (Figure 5). During tests, doors between resident rooms and corridors remained closed while bathroom doors inside resident rooms remained open. Figure 5. Resident room DNA tracer aerosol release and s ampling locations (SP = sample locations , OP = aerosol release point ) Following PCR analyses of resident room samples, moderate contaminant load reductions were associated with increasing ventilation rates. Specifically, increasing ventilation rates from 1 to 3 OACH increased the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value from 1.15 to 1.23, corresponding to a contaminant load reduction of approximately 17% from 70,795 particles per liter (p/L) of indoor air to 58,884 p/L (Figure 6). Increasing ventilation rates from 3 to 8 OACH further increased the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value from 1.23 to 1.40, corresponding to an additional contaminant load reduction of approximately 33% from 58,884 p/L to 39,811 p/L. On average, each air change was asso ciated with a 7% contaminant load reduction. Overall, contaminant load reductions within resident rooms were strongly correlated to outdoor air change rates ( r 2 >0.98). In contrast, contaminant load reductions were weakly correlated to total air change rates ( r2 < 0.49). Increasing TACH from 3 to 12 while holding outdoor air change rate constant did not result in a significant reduction in contaminant load. Similarly, there was weakly observed correlation between air pressure relationships and changes in co ntaminant load in either resident room. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 10 Figure 6. Resident room DNA tracer reduction log 10 value and corresponding particle concentration (p/L) compared to resident room air change rate and directional airflow , using standard deviation/SQRt of the sampl e size 2.2.2 Resident Room Transmission to Corridor DNA tracer samples were also collected at two locations in the corridor adjacent to resident rooms to evaluate the effect of directional airflow on the containment of contaminants to resident rooms 1 and 2. Tra cer samples were collected for 40 minutes at either end of the corridor at a height of a pproximately 0.8 m (30 in.) above the floor (Figure 7). Of note, resident rooms in the experimental test space under negative room air pressure were equipped with anterooms. Resident rooms in the control test space under neutral room air pressure were not equipped with anterooms. Doors between resident rooms, anterooms, and the corridor remained closed during tests. Following PCR analyses of corridor samples, reductions in tracer aerosol movement from resident rooms to the corridor were associated with dire ctional airflow. With positive air pressure in the corridor and neutral air pressure in the resident rooms (moderate inward airflow), the average DNA tracer reduction l og 10 value in the corridor ranged between 3.83 to 3.98, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 105 to 148 p/L (Figure 8). With positive air pressure in the corridor and negative air pressure in the resident rooms (strong inward airflow), the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in the corridor ranged between 4.45 and 5.10, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 10 to 35 p/L. Overall, tracer aerosol movement from the resident rooms to the corridor was correlated to directional airflow (r 2 >0.90). In contrast, air change rates and subsequent contaminant loads in resident rooms were weakly correlated to contaminant loads in the corridor ( r2 <0.46). Working with directional Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 11 airflow, room doors likely contributed to the containment of airborne contaminants to resident rooms. With resident room doors closed, tracer aerosol movement from rooms to the corridor was greatly reduced regardless of neutral or negative airflow mode or the use of anterooms. Figure 7. Resident room DNA tracer aerosol release and corridor sampling locations Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 12 Figure 8. Corridor DNA tracer reduc tion log 10 value and corresponding particle concentration (p/L) compared to resident room air change rate and directional airflow Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 13 2.2.3 Corridor Transmission to Resident Rooms To evaluate the effect of directional airflow on contaminant movement from the corridor to the resident rooms, DNA tracer aerosol was released in the corridor and sampled in resident rooms 1 and 2. For each test, tracer aerosol was released in the middl e of the corridor. DNA tracer samples were then collected for 40 minutes at two locations in each resident room (Figure 9). Doors between resident rooms, anterooms, and the corridor remained closed during tests. Figure 9. Corridor DNA tracer aerosol relea se and resident room sampling locations Following PCR analyses of resident room samples, moderate increases in tracer aerosol movement from the corridor to the resident rooms were associated with directional airflow. With positive air pressure in the co rridor and neutral air pressure in resident rooms, the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in the resident rooms ranged between 2.85 to 3.13, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 741 to 1,413 p/L (Figure 10). With positive air pressure in the corridor and negative air pressure in resident rooms, the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in the resident rooms ranged between 2.30 to 2.50, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 3,162 to 5,012 p/L. Overall, tracer aerosol movement from the corridor to the resident rooms was correlated to directional airflow ( r2 >0.82). In contrast, air change rates in resident rooms were not correlated to contaminant movement from the corridor to the resident rooms ( r2 <0.09). Working against directional airflow, room doors had less effect on the containment of airborne contaminants moving from the corridor to resident rooms. With resident room and anteroom doors closed, Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 14 tracer aerosol movement from the corridor to the resident rooms was signi ficantly greater in the negative airflow mode compared to the neutral airflow mode. Figure 10. Resident room DNA tracer reduction log 10 value and corresponding particle concentration (p/L) compared to resident room air change rate and directional ai rflow 2.2.4 Resident Room Transmission to Staff Room To further assess exposure risks to healthcare workers, DNA tracer aerosol was released inside resident rooms 1 and 2 and sampled in the staff room. Again, tracer aerosol was released at the head of the resident room bed toward the opposite corner of the room at a height of 0.8 m (30 in.) above the floor. DNA tracer samples were then collected for 40 minutes in the staff room at a height of 0.8 m (30 in.) above the floor (Figure 11). Doors between resident room s and the staff room were closed during tests. Following PCR analyses of staff room samples, moderate reductions in tracer aerosol movement from resident rooms to the staff room were associated with directional airflow. With positive air pressure in the co rridor and neutral air pressure in the staff room and resident rooms, the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in the staff room ranged between 3.75 and 4.05, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 89 to 178 p/L (Figure 12). With positive air pressure in the staff room and corridor and negative air pressure in the resident rooms, the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in the staff room ranged between 4.75 and 5.45, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 4 to 18 p/L. Ove rall, tracer aerosol movement from resident rooms to the staff room was correlated to directional airflow ( r2 >0.93). In contrast, outdoor air change rates and subsequent contaminant loads in resident rooms were weakly correlated to contaminan t loads in the staff room (r 2 <0.51). For tracer aerosol released in the corridor, Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 15 however, aerosol movement from the corridor to the staff room was significantly greater in the neutral airflow mode compared to the negative airflow mode ( r2 >0.99). With the staff room and resident rooms in the neutral airflow mode, the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in the staff room ranged between 1.70 and 2.0, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 10,000 to 19,953 p/L. With the staff room positive and resident rooms negative, the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in the staff room ranged between 4.30 and 4.40, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 40 to 50 p/L. Figure 11. Resident room DNA tracer aerosol release and staff ro om sampling locations Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 16 Figure 12. Staff room DNA tracer reduction log 10 value and corresponding particle concentration (p/L) compared to resident room air change rate and directional airflow 2.2.5 Isolation Zone Transmission to Common Areas To assess exposure risks to healthcare workers and residents outside of the isolation zone, DNA tracer aerosol was released inside resident rooms 1 and 2 and sampled in a nearby resident room, living room, and kitchen area. DNA tracer samples were collected for 40 minutes in each space at a height of 0.6-0.8 m (24-30 in .) above the floor (Figure 13). All doors within the isolation zone remained closed during tests as well as doors between the isolation zone and common areas. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 17 Figure 13. Resident room DNA tracer aerosol release and common areas sampling locations Following PCR analyses of common area samples, reductions in tracer aerosol movement from resident rooms in the isolation zone to common areas outside of the isolation zone were not associated with directional airflow and only weakly associated with air change rates ( r 2 >0.44). With positive air pressure in the corridor and neutral airflow in resident rooms, the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in the areas outside of the isolation zone ranged between 4.55 and 4.90, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 13 to 28 p/L (Figure 14). With positive air pressure in the corridor and negative airflow in resident rooms, the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in areas outside of the isolation zone ranged between 4.35 and 5.38, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 4 to 45 p/L. For tracer aerosol released in the isolation zone corridor, however, aerosol movement from the corridor to areas outside of the isolation zone were marginally associated with dir ectional airflow (r2 >0.51) and moderately associated with air change rates ( r2 >0.75). With resident rooms in the neutral airflow mode, the average DNA tracer reduction lo g10 value outside of the isolation zone ranged between 3.70 and 4.10, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 79 to 200 p/L. With resident rooms in the negative airflow mode, the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value in areas outside of the isolation zone ranged between 4.20 and 5.30, corresponding to a contaminant load of approximately 5 to 63 p/L. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 18 Figure 14. Common areas DNA tracer reduction log 10 value and corresponding particle concentration (p/L) compared to resident room air change rate and directional airflow 2.2.6 Isolation Zone Transmission to HVAC Systems DNA tracer s amples were also collected at two locations inside of the HVAC system serving both the isolation zone and common spaces outside of the isolation zone. Tracer samples were collected for 40 minutes in the return air duct immediately upstream of the MERV 14 a ir filter (Figure 15) and in the supply air duct immediately downstream of the air filter (Figure 17). Of note, resident rooms in the negative airflow mode were equipped with HEPA filtration fan units at the return air location. Resident rooms in the neutral airflow mode were not equipped with HEPA filtration. Following PCR analyses of return air samples, moderate contaminant load reductions were associated with increasing ventilation rates. Specifically, increasing ventilation rates from 1 to 3 OACH incr eased the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value from 4.0 to 4.20, corresponding to a contaminant load reduction from 100 to 63 p/L (Figure 16). Adding HEPA return air filtration and increasing ventilation rates from 3 to 8 OACH further incre ased the ave rage DNA tracer reduction log 10 value from 4.20 to 5.0, corresponding to an additional contaminant load reduction from 63 to 10 p/L. Overall, contaminant load reductions within HVAC return air were strongly correlated to outdoor air change rate s (r2 >0.96) and likely, the effect outdoor air change rates had on resident room contaminant loads. Following analyses of supply air samples, no significant changes in contaminant loads were observed with respect to either directional airflow or ventila tion rates in resident rooms (Figure 18). For supply air consisting of 100% outdoor air, no contaminants should be present unless Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 19 exhaust air from the isolation zone inadvertently mixed with ventilation air. For supply air consisting of 30% outdoor air, dilution and M ERV 14 filtration appeared to have reduced contaminant loads to near- negligible levels. Figure 15.

One test was conducted at 1 OACH (100 cfm) and another was conducted at 6 OACH (650 cfm) in a 750 ft 2 (6,300 cf) exercise room (Figure 19) located outside of the isolation zone. The duration of each test was 40 minutes and utilized two DNA tracer aerosol release points and two air sampling locations. Each sampling location consisted of four air samplers to record the decay of tracer aerosol at 10 -minute intervals over the 40- minute test sequence. Figure 19. Exercise room DNA tracer aerosol release and sampling locations Following PCR analyses of exercise room samples, significant contaminant load reductions were associated with increasing ventila tion rates. Specifically, increasing ventilation rates from 1 to 6 OACH increased the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value from 2.0 to 2.40 after 10 minutes, corresponding to a contaminant load reduction from 10,000 to 3,981 p/L (Figure 20). Increasing ventilation rates from 1 to 6 O ACH further increased the average DNA tracer reduction log 10 value from 3.35 to 4.75 after 40 minutes, corresponding to a contaminant load reduction from 447 to 18 p/L. On average, the contaminant decay rate at 6 OACH was more than twice the decay rate at 1 OACH. At 6 OACH, a 99.0% contaminant load reduction (i.e., \" removal efficiency \") is achieved after 40 minutes compared to a 90.0% contaminant load reduction at 1 OACH. By comparison, a 99.0% removal efficiency at 1 OACH would require approximately 3- 4 hours. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 22 Figure 20. Exercise room DNA tracer reduction log 10 value and corresponding particle concentration (p/L) compared to air change rate Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 23 3 Conclusions Results suggest ventilation rates had a modest effect on contaminant loads and exposure risks within r esident rooms. Increasing air change rates from 1 to 8 OACH, for example, reduced the contaminant load and potential exposure risk to healthcare workers from an infectious occupant by roughly half (43.8%) from 7.1x103 p/L to 3.9 x103 p/L. This finding was consistent with results from other similar studies that found a ir change rates were not effective in proportionately reducing aerosol concentrations within hospital patient rooms. In one such ASHRAE study, increasing air change rates from two to five ACH r educed concentrations of aerosols less than 5 m by only 30% on average (Grosskopf and Mousavi 2014). Under the assumption of a well- mixed space, it can be shown that contaminants decay exponentially in time . In spaces with recirculated air (e.g. , less than 100% outside air), the decay rate can be expressed as a function of the air change rate: ()=0 \u00d7[(1 )\u00d7(1 )1]\u00d7 where, load C(t) is the contaminant load as a function of time is the outside air percentage is the filtration efficiency . In sp aces with 100% outside air (or 100% filter efficiency), the decay rate can be simplified as : ()=0 \u00d7 It would therefore be expected that contaminant loads observed in resident rooms would correspond proportionately to air change rates, and specifically , outdoor air change rates. Results suggest that resident room contaminant loads did not correspond proportionately to air change rates. Possible explanations include the likelihood that the resident rooms are not well mixed, suggesting that areas of the room between the supply air and the exhaust air may receive more air changes whereas areas of t he room obstructed by partitions or furnishings may receive fewer air changes. Other explanations may include the effects of air turbulence, particularly at higher air change rates. Air turbulence may impede other contaminant removal mechanisms such as surface deposition and gravitational settling. Vortices created by turbulence may further \" trap\" and suspend contaminants in room air currents, preventing their effective removal. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 24 Similarly, ventilation rates had a modest effect on contaminant loads in HVAC s ystems. Increasing air change rates from 1 to 8 OACH and adding HEPA return air filtration reduced the contaminant load in the return air from 100 to 10 p/L. In relation to resident room contaminant loads however, contaminant loads in the return air were v ery low regardless of air change rate or filtration. Ventilation rates , however, were found to have a significant effect on contaminant loads and exposure risks in common areas. Increasing air change rates from 1 to 6 OACH reduced the time required to achieve \"room recovery ,\" or the removal of 99% of contaminants, from 3 hours to less than 40 minutes once the infectious source was removed. Directio nal airflow was found to have a significant effect on contaminant mobility from resident rooms to adjacent spaces. Contaminant movement from negative-pressure resident rooms to the corridor was on average 10-35 p/L, <20% of the contaminant movement observed from neutral pressure rooms to the corridor (105-148 p/L). Similarly, contaminant movement from the negative pressure resident room to the positive pressure staff room was on average 4-18 p/L, less than 10% the contaminant movement observed from the neutral pressure resident room to the neutral pressure staff room (89 -178 p/L). Little difference, however, was observed in contaminant movement from either neutral or negative-pressure resident rooms in the isolation zone to the common areas outside of the isolation zone. This finding suggests that while closed, resident room doors likely had a greater effect on contaminant movement than directional airflow. Under normal operational conditions, however, with healthcare workers entering and exiting resident rooms, the effects of directional airflow would likely have been more evident. In fact, door position, door motion, and healthcare worker movement have been implicated in the transmission of airborne disease in several epidemiological studies dating back more than 40 years (Leclair et al. 1980; Gustafson et al. 1982; Josephson and Gombert 1988; Edlin et al. 2008; Eames et al. 2009; Mousavi and Grosskopf 2016). Analysis of the door opening motion in these and other studies s uggests that directional airflow relationships between isolation and adjacent healthcare spaces can be terminated and even reversed by door position, door motion, and healthcare worker movement. Overall, contaminant loads observed in spaces outside of resi dent rooms were on average two to three orders of magnitude less than the contaminant loads observed inside of the resident rooms, suggesting the effectiveness of both physical airflow barriers and directional airflow to limit bioaerosol mobility within te mporary isolation spaces and between isolation spaces and the LTC environment.

Presymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 Infections and Transmission in a Skilled Nursing Facility . New England Journal of Medicine. SARS -CoV-2 infection can spread rapidly within skilled nursing facilities. After identification of a case of C OVID -19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom -based screening to identify infections in residents. Twenty -three days after the first positive t est result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS- CoV-2. 56% were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days). Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT -PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents. As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS -CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit ) and 15 had die d (mortality 26%). Blackman , Carolyn et al. An Illustration of SARS- CoV-2 Dissemination Within a Skilled Nursing Facility Using Heat Maps . Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. To illustrate dissemination and asymptomatic transmission of SARS -CoV-2 du ring an outbreak a t a 150- bed skilled nursing facility ( SNF), heat maps were generated by the SNF's infection prevention team to track staff and resident symptoms and SARS -CoV-2 test results to identify infection patterns. The SNF experienced a severe outb reak of SARS -CoV-2 early in the pandemic. The initial cluster of residents with symptoms and the first confirmed case occurred on the SNF's Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 28 dementia care unit. The insufficient availability and prolonged turnaround time of testing for both residents and st aff at the outset of the outbreak prevented timely and accurate identification and cohorting of cases. Despite extensive other infection control measures being in place, SARS- CoV-2 disseminated widely through the facility within three weeks of the first confirmed case, resu lting in significant morbidity and mortality.

Outbreak of COVID -19 in a nursing home associated with aerosol transmission as a result of inadequate ventilation. Clinical Infectious Diseases. Data suggest that this outbreak is caused by aerosol transmission of COVID -19 in a situation of inadequate ventilation for several reasons. First, the near - simultaneous detection of COVID -19 infections of almost all residents healthcare workers within a ward in which care was provided with surgical masks. Second, the limitation of the outbreak to this particular ward with a deviating ventilation system that recirculated unfiltered inside air in combination with the detection of COVID -19 on the filters of this system. The indoor air was only refreshed with outside a ir based on real -time CO 2 concentration meas urements. If the CO 2 concentration did not exceed 1 ,000 ppm, the ventilation cabinets recirculated indoor air back into the ward without filtration . In this situation, low CO 2 production by inactive nursing home patients might have limited the ventilation with outside air. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 29 Kimball , Anne et al. Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic SAR S- CoV-2 Infections in Residents of a Long- Term Care Skilled Nursing Facility . Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Following identification of a case of COVID -19 in a health care worker, 76 of 82 residents of a skilled nursing facility (SNF) were tested for SARS -CoV-2. 16 days after the introduction of SARS -CoV-2 into facility A, facili ty-wide testing identified a 30.3% prevalence of infection among residents , indicating very rapid spread, despite early adoption of infection prevention and control measure s. Approximately half of all residents with positive test results did not have any symptoms at the time of testing, s uggesting that transmission from asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents, who were not recognized as having SARS- CoV-2 infection and ther efore not isolated, might have contributed to further spread. Lynch, Richard M. et al. Practical Steps to Improve Air Flow in Long -Term Care Resident Rooms to Reduce COVID -19 Infection Risk . Journal of the American Medical Directors Association. The poten tial for spread of COVID -19 infections in SNFs and other LTC sites poses new challenges for nursing home administrato rs to protect patients a nd staff. It is anticipated that as acute care hospitals reach capacity, nursing homes may retain COVID -19 infected residents longer prior to transferring to an acute care hospital. This article outlines five pragmatic steps that LT C facilities can take to manage airflow within resident rooms to reduce the potential for spread of infectious airborne droplets into surrounding areas, including hallways and adjacent rooms, using strategies adapted from negative- pressure isolation rooms in acute care fa cilities. Miller , Shelly et al. Implementing a Negative Pressure Isolation Space within a Skilled Nursing Facility to Cont rol SARS -CoV-2 Transmission . American Journal of Infection Control. The COVID -19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which is difficult to accomplish in SNFs . This study designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at an SNF in Lancaster, PA. The study created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system. It measured pressure and performed computational fluid dynamics modeli ng to test containment and possible transmission given the isolation space i s negative rather than individual rooms. Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average hourly value of ( standard deviation) - 2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 30 Table A -2.

This study was conducted i n one 160- bed long -term care facility. Following discharge of each resident, the room was cleaned and then disinfected using a newly acquired UV light disinfection device . 36 months of pret est infection and hospitalization data were compared with 12 months of posttest data. There were significant decreases in nursing home -acquired relative to hospital- acquired infection rates for the total infections (p = .004), urinary tract infection rates (p = .014), respiratory system infection rates (p = .017) , and for rates of infection of the skin and soft tissues (p = .014). Hospitalizations for infection decreased significantly, with a notable decrease in hospitalization for pneumonia (p = .006). Pulsed -xenon UV disinfection device is superior to manual cleaning on environmental surfaces, as well as decreasing infection rates. Placing a stronger emphasis on environmental surface disinfection in LTC facilities may decrease nursing home i nfections. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 33 Lansbury , Louise E. et al. 2017 Influenza in long -term care facilitie s. Influenza. LTC facility environments and the vulnerability of their residents provide a setting conducive to the rapid spread of respiratory pathogens . Infections may be introduced by staff, visitors , or new or transferred residents, and outbreaks of influenza in such settings can have devastating consequences for individuals. Reside nts sharing a room with an influenza -infected roommate have three times the ri sk of acquiring infection than those in single rooms. As the population ages over the coming dec ades, increased provision of such facilities seems likely. The need for robust infection prevention and control practices will therefore remain of paramoun t importance if the impact of outbreaks is to be minimi zed. In this review, we discuss the nature of the problem of influenza in LTC facilities and approaches to preventive and control measures, including vaccination of residents and staff, and the use of antiviral drugs for treatment and prophylaxis, based on currently available evidence. Montoya, Ana et al. 2011 Common infections in nursing homes : a review of current issues and challenges . Aging Health. More than 1.5 million people live in 16,000 nursin g homes in the United States , according to the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey. More than 88% of th ese people are 65 years of age and older, and 45% are age 85 years and older. It is estimated that the number of people who will require nursing home care in the United States will reach 5.3 million by 2030. The acuity of illness in this population has increased substantially in the last decade, as has the risk of acquiring new infections. Although recent estimates are lacking, approximately 2 million infect ions occur in U .S. nursing homes each year. In addition, a point prevalence survey revealed that the prevalence of nursing home -associated infections on the day of the survey was 5.2% in Veterans Administration Community Living Center facilities in the Uni ted States . Internationally, a three- year study in t he Netherlands reported a prevalence of healthcar e-associated infections of 6.7% in 2007, 7.6% in 2008, and 7.6% in 2009, ranging from 0 % to 32.4% between nursing homes. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 34 Strausbaugh, Larry J. 2003 Infectious Disease Outbreaks in Nursing Homes : An Unappreciated Hazard for Frail Elderly Persons . Clinical Infectious Diseases . Nursing homes provide an ideal environment for acquisition and spread of infection: susceptible residents who share sources of a ir, food, water, and health care in a crowded institutional setting. Moreover, visitors, staff, and residen ts constantly come and go, bringing in pathogens from both the hospital and the community. Outbreaks of respiratory and gastrointestinal infection pr edominate in this setting. Outbreaks of respiratory and gastrointestinal infection predominate in this setting. Depending on the infectious agent, they may spread via large respiratory droplets, direct or indirect contact, or airborne droplet nuclei. Disea se attack rates generally ranged from 20% to 30% but several were >40%. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 35 Table A -3.

(Preprint ). The l ong-term tr end of temperature and relative humidity were obtained with a 14 - day adjacent -averaging filter, and lagged correlations of the number of daily confirmed cases were explored. The analysis showed negative correlations between temperatures with the number of daily confirmed cases . Maximum correlations were found for six -day lagged temperatures, which is likely reflecting the incubation period of the virus. It was postulated that the indoor crowding effect is responsible of the high incidence of 2019- nCoV cases , where low absolute humidity and close human contact facilitate the transport of aerosol droplets. Anderson, Elizabeth L. et al. 2020 Consideration of the Aerosol Transmission for COVID -19 and Public Health . Risk Analysis . This article analyzes the available evidence to address airborne, aerosol transmission of SARS -CoV-2. We review and present three lines of evidence: case reports of transmission for asymptomatic individuals in association with studies that show that normal breathing and talking produce predominantly small droplets of the size that are subject to aerosol transport; limited empirical data that have recorded aerosoliz ed SARS -CoV-2 particles that remain suspended in the air for hours and are subject to trans port over distances including out side of rooms and intrabuilding, and the broader literature that further supports the importance of aerosol transmission of infectio us diseases. The weight of the available evidence warrants immediate attention to address the significance of aerosols and implications for public health protection. Araujo, Miguel B . et al. 2020 Spread of SARS -CoV-2 Coronavirus likely to be constrained by climate . (Preprint ). The emergence of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks much like other respiratory diseases is proba ble. People in temperate warm and cold climates are more vulnerable. Those in arid climates follow next in vulnerability, while the disease will likely marginally affect the tropics. Our projections minimize uncertainties related with spread of SARS CoV -2, providing critical information for anticipating the adequate social, economic, and political responses. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 36 ASHRAE 2020 ASHRAE Position Document on Infectious Aerosols . ASHRAE's position is that facilities of a ll types should follow, as a minimum, the latest published standards and guidelines and good engineering practice. ANSI/ASHRAE Standards 62.1 and 62.2 include requirements f or outdoor air ventilation in most residential and nonresidential spaces, and ANSI/ASHRAE/ASHE Standard 170 covers both outdoor and total air ventilation in healthcare facilities. Based on risk assessments or owner project requirements, designers of new an d existing facilities could go beyond the minimum requirements of these standards, using techniques covered in various ASHRAE publi cations, including the ASHRAE Handbook volumes, Research Project final reports, papers and articles, and design guides, to be even better prepared to control the dissemination of infectious aerosols. Azimi , Parham et al. 2020 Mechanistic Transmission Mode ling of COVID- 19 on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship Demonstrates the Importan ce of Aerosol Transmission . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The current prevailing position is that COVID- 19 is transmitted primarily through large respiratory droplets within close proximity (i.e., 1- 2 m) of infected individuals. However, quantitative information on the relative importance of specific transmission pathways of SARS -CoV-2 (i.e., droplets, aerosols, and fomites across short - and long - range distances) remains limited. Mean estimates of the contributions of short -range, long-range, and fomite transmission modes to infected cases aboard the ship across the entire simulation time period were 35%, 35%, and 30%, respectively. Mean estimates of the contributions of large respiratory droplets and small respiratory aerosols were 41 % and 59% . Short -range transmission was the dominant mode after passeng er quarantine began, albeit due primarily to aerosol transmission, not droplets . Bannister -Tyrrell , Melanie et al. 2020 Preliminary evidence that higher temperatures are associated with lower incidence of COVID - 19, for cases reported globally up to 29th February 2020 . (Preprint ). Using global line -list data on COVID- 19 cases reported until February 29, 2020, and global gridded temperature data, and after adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID -19 incidence for temperatures of 1\u00b0C and higher. However, temperature explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID -19 incidence. These preliminary findings support stringent containment efforts in Europe and elsewhere. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 37 Biqing, Chen et al. 2020 Roles of meteorological conditions in COVID- 19 transmission on a worldwide scale . (Preprint ). This paper examines the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicate the severity of COVID -19 spread, and four meteorological variables \u2014air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility \u2014were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/provinces in Italy, 21 cities/prov inces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to mode l against the daily epidemic situation as it is best correlated with the outbreak . Tak ing Chinese cities as a discovery data set, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative hu midity combined together could best predict the epidemic situati on. Bourouiba , Lydia 2020 Turbulent Gas Clouds and Respiratory Pathogen Emissions Potential Implications for Reducing Transmission of COVID -19. Journal of the American Medical Association. Given various combinations of an individual patient's physiology and environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature, the gas cloud and its payload of pathogen -bearing droplets of all sizes can travel 23 to 27 feet (7- 8 m) . Throughout the trajectory, droplets of all sizes settle out or evaporate at rates that d epend not only on their size, but also on the degree of turbulence and speed of the gas cloud, coupled with the properties of the ambient environment (temperature, humidity, and airflow). Buonanno , Manuela et al. 2020 Far-UVC light efficiently inactivates airborne human 222 nm) efficiently kills pathogens without harm to exposed human cells or tissues. We previously demonstrated that UVC kills pathogens without harm at 222- nm wavelengths . We extend the far -UVC studies to explor e efficacy against hu man coronaviruses from subgroups alpha (HCoV -229E) and beta (HCoV -OC43). We found that low doses of, respectively , 1.7 and 1.2 mJ/cm2 inactivated 99.9% coronavirus OC43. Based these resu lts for the beta HCo V-OC43 coronavirus, continuous far -UVC exposure in public locations at the currently recommended exposure limit (3 mJ/cm 2/hour) would result in 99.9% viral inactivation in approximate ly 25 minutes. Increasing the far -UVC intensity by, say, a factor of 2 would halve these disinfection times, while still maintaining safety. As coronaviruses have similar genomic size, a key determinant of radiation sensitivity, it is realistic to expect t hat far -UVC light will show Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 38 comparable inactivation efficiency against ot her human coronaviruses, including SARS - CoV-2. CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus RT -PCR Identification Protocols (2019- nCoV) Real -Time -PCR Diagnostic Pane l is a real-time RT -PCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the 2019- nCoV in upper and lower respiratory specimens (such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyng eal swabs , sputum, lower respiratory tract e, and nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate) collected from individuals who meet 2019 -nCoV clinical and/or epidemiological criteria. Chia P .Y. et al. 2020 Detection of Air and Surface Contamination by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviru s 2 (SARS -CoV-2) in Hospital Rooms of Infected Patients . Nature Communications . Understanding the particle size distribution in the air and patterns of environmental contamination of SARS -CoV-2 is essential f or infection prevention policies. Here we screen surface and air samples from hospital rooms of COVID -19 patients for SARS- CoV-2 RNA. Environmental sampling is conducted in three AIIRs in the ICU and 27 AIIRs in the general ward. 245 surface samples are co llected. 56.7% of rooms have at least one environmental surface contaminated . High touch surface contamination is shown in ten (66.7%) out of 15 patients in the first week of illness, and three (20%) beyond the first week of illness (p=0.01, x2 test). Air sampling is performed in three of the 27 AIIRs i n the general ward, and detects SARS -CoV-2 PCR- positive particles of sizes >4\u00b5m and 1 -4 \u00b5m in two rooms, despite these rooms having 12 air changes per hour . This warrants f urther study of the airborne transmi ssion potential of SARS -CoV-2. Chin, A. et al. 2020 Stability of SARS - CoV-2 in different environmental conditions . Lancet Microbe.

Dai, Hui et al. 2020 Association of the infection probability of COVID -19 with vent ilation rates in confined spaces . Building Simulation. A growing number of cases have proved the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID -19. Ensuring an adequate ventilation rate is essential to reduce the risk of infection in confined spaces. In thi s study, we estimated the association between the infection probability and ventilation rates with the Wells -Riley equation , where the quantum generation rate (q) by a COVID -19 infector was obtained using a reproductive number -based fitting approach. The e stimated q value of COVID -19 is 14- 48 h -1. To ensure an infection probability of less t han 1%, a ventilation rate larger than common values (100- 350 m 3/h per infector and 1 ,200-4, 000 m3/h per infector for 0.25 h and 3 h of exposure, respectively) is requir ed. Ding, Z hen et al. 2020 Toilets dominate environmental detection of SARS -CoV-2 virus in a hospital . Science of the Total Environment . The 107 surface samples comprised 37 from toilets, 34 from other surfaces isolation rooms (ventilated at 30 30- 60 L/ s s), and 36 from other surfaces outside isolation rooms in the hospital. Four of these samples were positive, namely two ward door handles, one bathroom toilet seat cover and one bathroom door handle; and three were weakly positive, namely one bathroom toilet seat, one bathroom washbasin tap lever , and one bathroom ceiling -exhaus t louvre. One of the 46 air samples was weakly positive, and this was a corridor air sample. The two exhaled condensate samples and the two expired air samples were negative.

The use of 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (dilution 1:50 if household bleach at an initial concentration o f 5% is used) after cleaning with a neutral detergent is suggested for decontamination purposes, although no data on the effectiveness against SARS -CoV-2 are available. For surfaces that could be damaged by sodium hypochlorite, 70% concentration of ethanol is needed for decontamination after cleaning with a neutral detergent.

Ficetola , Francesco et al. 2020 Climate affects global patterns of COVID -19 early outbreak dynamics . (Prepri nt) Growth rates peaked in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere with mean temperature of approximately 5 degrees, and humidity of approx imately 0.6- 1 kPa during the outbreak month, while they decreased in warmer and colder regions. The strong relationship between local climate and COVID- 19 growth rates suggests the possibility of seasonal variation in the spatial patter n of outbreaks, with temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere becoming at particular risk of severe outbreaks during the next mo nths. Fottrell , Quentin 2020 Coronavirus droplets caused by talking remain in the air for 8 - 14 minutes . CNBC. Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic carriers of SARS- CoV-2 are increasi ngly considered to be a likely mode of disease transmission. Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second. In a closed, stagnant -air environment, they disappear fro m view after 8 minutes to 14 minutes, which corresponds to droplet nuclei of 4 \u00b5 m diameter , or 12 \u00b5 m to 21 \u00b5m droplets prior t o dehydration. The coronavirus is 0.125 \u00b5m. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 41 Ghaffarzadegan Navid et al. 2020 Simulation -based Est imation of the Spread of COVID -19 in Iran . (Preprint). The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M -2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K -97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K -172K). Implication: Our results suggest that the number of cases and deaths may be over an order of magnitude larger than official statistics in Iran. Absent extended testing capacity , other countries may fa ce a significant under -count of existing cases and thus be caught off guard about the actual toll of the epidemic. Gorbunov , B. 2020 Aeros ol particle s laden with COVID -19 travel over 30m distance . (Preprint). The results obtained demonstrate that aerosol particles generated by coughing and sneezing can travel over 30 m. Modelling of the evolution of aerosol clouds generated by coughing and s neezing enables us to evaluate the deposition dose of aerosol particles in healthy individuals. For example, a person in a public place (e.g. , supermarket or car park) can accumulat e in the respiratory system up to 200 virus copies in 2 min utes' time by br eathing in virus -laden aerosols . Wearing a face mask considerably reduces the deposited load down to 2 virus copies per 2 min ute. Guan, L. et al. 2020 More awareness is needed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2019 transmission through ex haled air during non- invasive respiratory support: experience from China . European Respiratory Journal . Human -to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission. However, exhaled air dispersio n during non- invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission, and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 42 Guo, Z. et a l. 2020 Aerosol and Surface Distribution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronav irus 2 in Hospital Wards, Wuhan, China, 2020. Emerging Infectious Diseases . This study led to three conclusions. First, SARS- CoV-2 was widely distributed in the air and on object surfaces in both the ICU and general ward , implying a potentially high infect ion risk for medical staff and other close contacts. Second, the environmental contamination was greater in the ICU than in the general ward ; thus, stricter protective mea sures should be taken by medical staff working in the ICU. Third, the SARS -CoV-2 aero sol distribution characteristics in the ICU indicate that the transmission distance of SARS -CoV-2 might be 4 m. He, X. et al. 2020 Temporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID -19. Natural Medicine. We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 patients with laboratory- confirmed COVID -19 and modeled COVID- 19 infectiousness profiles from a separate sample of 77 infector -infect ee transmission pairs. We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% (95% confidence interval, 30 %- 57%) of secondary cases were infected during the index cases' presymptomatic stage, in settings with substantial househol d clustering, active case finding and quarantine outside the home. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presympto matic transmission. Horve , Patrick F. et al. 2020 Identification of SARS- CoV-2 RNA in Healthcare Heating, Ventilation , and Air Conditioning Units . (Preprint). Available information on SARS -CoV-2 transmission by small particle aerosols continues to evolve rapidly. To assess the potential role of HVAC systems in airborne viral transmission, this study sought to determine the viral presence, if any, on air handling units in a healthcare setting where COVID- 19 patients were being treated. The presence of SARS -CoV-2 RNA was detected in approximately 25% of samples taken from nine different locations in multiple air handlers . Houser , Kevin W. 2020 Ten Facts about UV Radiation and COVID -19. The Journal of the Illuminating Engineering Society . The COVID -19 pandemic has generated interest in the potential of UV radiation to disinfect air and surfaces. In response, the IES Photobi ology Committee published a freely available report about germicidal ultraviolet radiation. As an even -handed treatment of UV radiation's potential and limitations, the report is a welcomed counterpoint to information appearing in social media feeds, the popular press, and in shady sales literature. Included are ten facts about UV radiation and COVID -19. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 43 Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) 2020 Germicidal Ultraviolet (GUV). Commonly used GUV lamps generate predominantly 254 -nm UV radiant energy, which is close to the peak germicidal wavelengths of 265 to 270 nm \u2014both in the UV -C range, compared to th e longer -wavelength ultraviolet (UV -A and UV -B) in sunlight. GUV radiant energy damages nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) by causing mutations that prevent replicat ion, thus leading to the death of virtually all bacteria and inactivation of all viruses \u2014both DNA and RNA types. Bacteria and viruses vary somewhat in UV susceptibility, with environmental organisms, fungal spores, and mycobacteria being relatively harder to kill than more rapidly replicating and non -environmental microbes and most bacteria. But even f ungi are effectively killed with high -dose UV, which is used, for example, to treat fungal contamination of air conditioning systems. GUV can be most effectiv ely used to disinfect air in the upper room where ceiling height permits, but can also be used in ventilation ducts and room air cleaners , as noted. Upper -room GUV is considered the most effective application for room air disinfection . Illinois Institute of Technology ( IIT) 2020 Filtration of Infectious Aerosols . MERV 5, 7, and 11 filters are expected to provide infection risk reductions of 25% , 50% , and 60% . MERV ctions >65%. Jameel , Yusuf 2020 Will coronavirus by summer? (Preprint). Even though currently av ailab le data is skewed by minimal testing per capita in many tropical countries, it is possible that weather plays a role in the spread of 2019- nCoV which warrants an investigatio n. In the last 10 days, thousands of new cases have been documented in regions with T >18 \u00b0C suggesting that the role of warmer temperature in slowing the spread of the 2019 -nCoV, as suggested earlier might only be observed, if at all, at much higher temperatures. Unlike temperature, however, the range of average humidity ( AH) acros s which most of the cases have been documented has consistently been between 3 and 9 g/m3. Current data, although limited, suggests that it is extremely unlikely that the spread o f 2019- nCoV would slow down in the United States or Europe due to environment al factors, because a large number of cases have already been reported in the range of AH and T experienced by these regions for most part of the year. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 44 Jayaweera , Mahesh et al. 2020 Transmission of COVID -19 virus by droplets and aerosols . Environmental Research. The complete control of virus -laden droplet and aerosol transmission is poorly understood. This review paper intends to outline the literature concerning the transmission of virus -laden droplets and aerosols in different environment al set tings and demonstrates the behavior of droplets and aerosols resulted from a coughjet of an infected person in various confined spaces. Airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed. Interestingly, the nosocomial transmis sion by airborne SARS -CoV-2 virus -laden aerosols in healthcare facilities may be plausible. Hence, clearly defined, science -based administrative, clinical, and physical measures are of paramount importance to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic from the world. Kai, Yang et al. 2020 Analysis of epi demiological characteristics of coronavirus 2019 infection and preventive measures in Shenzhen China: a heavy population city. (Preprint). Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with a reported 416 confirmed cas es by February 20, 2020. Here, we analy zed the epid emiological characteristics of COVID -19 in Shenzhen and potential link s to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of CO VID-19 in Shenz hen can be classified in to three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 , and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of pat ients from Hubei decreased, and the nu mber of familia l clustering cases increased. Kissler , Stephen M . et al. 2020 Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS -CoV-2 through the post -pandemic period . Science . These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross -immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV -OC43 and HCoV -HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS- CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS -CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS- CoV-2. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 45 Klompas , Michael et al. 2020 Airborne Transmis sion of SARS - CoV-2. Journal of the American Medical Associat ion. The reproduction number for COVID -19 before measures were taken to mitigate its spread was estimated to be about 2.5, meaning that each person with COVID -19 infected an average of 2 to 3 othe r people. This reproduction number is similar to influen za and quite different from that of viruses that are well known to spread via aerosols such as measles, which has a reproduction number closer to 18. Considering that most people with COVID -19 are con tagious for about one week, a reproduction number of 2 to 3 is quite small given the large number of interactions, crowds, and personal contacts that most people have under normal circumstances within a seven - day period. Lewis, D. 2020 Is the coronavirus airborne? Experts can't agree . Nature. Health officials say the virus is transported only through droplets that are coughed or sneezed out \u2014either directly, or on objects. But some scientists say there is preliminary evidence that airborne trans mission \u2014in which the disease spreads in the much smaller particles from exhaled air, known as aerosols \u2014is occurring, and that precautions, such as increasing ventilation indoors , should be recommended to reduce the risk of infection. Li, Q. et al. 2020 Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronav irus-Infected Pneumonia . The New England Journal of Medicine. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). Li, W. et al. 2020 The characteristics of household transmi ssion of COVID -19. Clinical Infectious Diseases . Secondary transmission of SARS -CoV-2 developed in 64 of 392 household contacts (16.3%) . The secondary attack rate to children was 4% compared with 17.1% for adults . The secondary attack rate to the contacts within the households with index patients quarantined by themselves since ons et of symptoms was 0% compared with 16.9% for contacts without quarantined index patients. The secondary attack rate to contacts who were spouses of index cases was 27.8% compared with 17.3% for other adult members in the households. The secondary attack rat e of SARS -CoV-2 in household is 16.3%. Age of household contacts and spousal relationship to the index case are risk factors for transmission of SARS -CoV-2 within a hou sehold. Quarantine of Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 46 index patients at home since onset of symptoms is useful to preven t the transmission of SARS -Co-2 within a household. Li, Y. et al. 2020 Evidence for probable aerosol transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in a poorly ventilated restaurant . (Preprint). Three families (A, B, C), 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with SARS -CoV-2 at this time, or previously, ate lunch at Restaurant X on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 24, 2020) at three neighboring tables. Subsequentl y, three members of family B and two members of family C became infected with SARS - CoV-2, whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the ventilation rate was 0.75- 1.04 L/s per person . No close contact or fomite contact was observed, aside from back -to-back sitting by some patron s. Our results show that the infect ion distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus -laden aerosols. Aerosol transmission of SARS- CoV-2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of COVID -19. Lipsitch , Marc , Swerdlow, David L, and Finelli , Lyn 2020 Defining the Epidemiology of Covid -19 \u2014 Studies Needed. The New England Journal of Medicine. First, what is the full spectrum of disease severity (which can range from asymptomatic, to symptomatic -but-mild, to sev ere, to requiring hospitalization, to fatal)? Second, how transmissible is the virus? Third, who are the infectors \u2014how do the infected person's age, the severity of ill ness, and other characteristics of a case affect the risk of transmitting the infection to others? Of vital interest is the role that asymptomatic or presymptomatic infected persons play in transmission. When and for how long is the virus present in respiratory secretions? And fourth, what are the risk factors for severe illness or death? And how can we identify groups most likely to have poor outcomes so that we can focus prevention and treatment efforts? Liu, Y. et al. 2020 Aerodynamic Characteristics and RNA Concentration of SARS - CoV-2 Aerosol in Wuhan Hospitals during COVID- 19 Outbreak . (Preprint). The ICU, critical care unit, and general patient rooms inside Renmin, and the patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS -CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples from inside the ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient to ilet tested positive. The airborne SARS -CoV-2 in Fangcang Medical Staff Area had bimodal distribution with higher con centration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patient number was reduced and rigorous sanitization was implemented. Public areas had undetectable airborne SARS -CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 47 Liu, Y. et al. 2020 Aerodynamic analysis of SARS - CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals . Nature. Investigated the aerodynamic nature of SA RS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the outbreak of COVID -19 in 2020. The concentration of SARS- CoV-2 RNA in aerosols that was detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, b ut it was higher in the toilet areas used by the patients. Levels of airborne SARS -CoV-2 RNA in the most public areas were undetectable, except in two areas that were prone to crowding. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the <1.0 \u00b5m and/or >1.0 regions ; however, these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigo rous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the i nfectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we pr opose that SARS -CoV-2 may have the potential to be tra nsmitted through aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in aerosols. Luo, L. et al. 2020 Modes of contact and risk of transmission in COVID- 19 among close contacts . Annals of Internal Medicine. The proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections account for almost half of the confirmed cases among close contacts. The household contacts wer e the main transmission mode, and clinically more severe cases were more likely to pass the infection to their close contacts. Generally, the secondary cases were clinically milder than those of source cases. Luo, W., et al. 2020 The role of absolute humi dity on transmission rates of the COVID - 19 outbreak . (Preprint). Sustained transmission and rapid (exponential) growth of cases are possible over a range of humidity conditions ranging from cold and dry provinces in China, to tropical locations, such as Singapore. Changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) wil l not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventio ns. Luo, Wei et al. 2020 The role of absolute humidity on transmission rates of t he COVID - 19 outbreak . (Preprint). Here, we examine province- level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID -19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of tempera ture and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the N orth ern Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 48 Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to dec lines in COVID -19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health in terventions. Ma, Y . et al. 2020 Effects of temperature variation and humidity on the mortality of COVID -19 in Wuhan . Science of the Total Environment . A positive association with COVID- 19 mortality was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = - 0.32). In addition, each 1 -unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID- 19 mortality at lag 3. However, both per -1- unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID -19 mortality at lag 3 and lag 5, respectively.

Planning to develop a 12- hour response to implement containment measures. Mikszewski , Alex et al. 2020 Airborne Infection Risk Calculator . CUNY . The Airborne Infection Risk Calculator (AIRC) is an airborne contagion modeling tool programmed in Microsoft Excel and designed to assist facility managers, building engineers, and public and occupational health professionals in prospectively evaluating individual infection and communi ty transmission risks associated with specific indoor environments. AIRC can help users address two primary questions related to the risks associated with occupying an indoor space when community transmission of an infectious airborne pathogen, such as SAR S-CoV-2, is occurring: 1. What is the potential infection risk associated with varying lengths of stay in the space? 2. What number of occupants helps maintain a basic reproduction number (R0) less than one to prevent the exposure from further contributing to disease spread in the population? Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 49 Miller et al. 2020 Transmissio n and risk factors of COVID -19. Cleveland Clinic . The reproductive number (R0) for SARS -CoV-2 is 2.28 compared to 0.9 to 2.1 for influenza . Viral shedding can occur up to five days before symptom onset. SARS -CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID -19, is transmitted through respiratory secretions and saliva. The virus can also live for short periods of time ( one to several hours) on fomites such as doorknobs, handrails, and tables. Aerosolizati on of the virus can occur during procedures including bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and administration of nebulized treatments. Asymptomatic shedding of the virus does occur and may account for up to 60% of cases. Risk factors for a more severe course of COVID -19 include age 65 and older, living in a nursing home or LTC facility , chronic lung disease, and others. Miller , Shelly L. et al. 2017 Implementing a negativ e- pressure isolation ward for a surge in airborne infectious patients . American Journal of Infection Control . During an infectious disease outbreak, the number of patients needing health care services may exceed available negative -pressure isolation room c apacity . To test one method of increasing hospital surge capacity, a temporary negat ive-pressure isolation ward was established at a fully functioning hospital. Negative pressu re was achieved in a 30- bed hospital ward by adjusting the ventilation system. D ifferential pressure was continuously measured at 22 locations, and ventilation airf low was characterized throughout the ward. The pressure on the test ward relative to the mai n hospital hallway was - 29 Pa on average, approximately 10 times higher than the CDC guidanc e for airborne infection control. No occurrences of pressure reversal oc curred at the entrances to the ward, even when staff entered the ward. Pressures within the ward changed, with some rooms becoming neutrally or slightly positively pressuri zed. This study showed that establishing a temporary negative -pressure isolation war d is an effective method to increase surge capacity in a hospital. Morawska, Lidia et al. 2020 It is Time to Address Airborne Transmission of COVID -19. Clinical Infectious Diseases . A 5-\u00b5m droplet will travel tens of meters, much greater than the scale of a typical room, while settling from a height of 1.5 m to the floor. Several retrospective studies conducted after the SARS -CoV-1 epidemic demonst rated that airbo rne transmission was the most likely mechanism explaining the spatial pattern of infections . Retrospective analysis has shown the same for SARS -CoV-2. Many studies conducted on the spread of other viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, MERS -CoV, a nd Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 50 influenza, show that viable airborne viruses can be exhaled and/or detected in the indoor e nvironment of infected patients. Morowska, Lidia et al. 2020 How can airborne transmission of COVID -19 indoors be minimised? Environment International . Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces . While uncertainties remain rega rding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong t o warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation , possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation , and avoiding overcrowding. National Air Filtration Association (NAFA) 2020 COVID -19 Special Feature: HVAC Filtration And COVID -19. Filtration in building HVAC systems can be a par t of an overall risk mitigation approach. In order for filters to have any impact on infectious disease transmission, transmission has to occur thr ough the airborne route. High- efficiency filters may be appropriate, but they can also be counterproductive. A high -efficiency filter may have a high initial pressure drop and cause more air to bypass the filter . A high -pressure drop filter can also dimini sh the amount of air supplied into the environment , making the filter less effective as well as causing other problems with other parts of the HVAC system. In many residential and light commercial systems, the fan in the system does no t run very often and the efficiency of the filter may not be as important as it could be. Nishiura, H . et al. 2020 Closed environments facilitate secondary transmission of coronavirus disease 2019. (Preprint). Commissioned by the Minister of the Ministry of Health, Labour, a nd Welfare of Japan, we collected secondary transmission data with the aim of identifying high -risk transmission settings. We show that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID- 19 and promote superspreading events. Closed environme nts are consistent with large -scale COVID -19 transmission events such as that of the ski chalet -associated cluster in France and the church- and hospital -associated clusters in South Korea. Our findings are a lso consistent with the declining incidence of C OVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease. Reduction of unnecessary close contact in closed environments may help prevent large case clusters and superspreading events. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 51 Neher , Richard A. et al. 2020 Potential impact of seasonal forcing on a SARS -CoV-2 pandemic . Swiss Medical Weekly . While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contai ned. Seasonal forcing on SARS- CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandem ic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems. Oliveiros , Barbara et al. 2020 Role of temperature and humidity in the modulation of the doubling time of COVID- 19 cases. (Preprint). Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID -19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the N orth ern Hemisphere. A 20 \u00b0C increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportatio n, or cultural aspe cts. Ong, S. e t al. 2020 Surface Environmental , and Personal Protective Equipment Contamination by SARS -CoV-2 From a Symptomatic Patient . Journal of the American Medical Association . There was extensive environmental contamination by 1 SARS -CoV-2 patient with mild upper respiratory tract involvement. Toilet bowl and sink samples were positive, suggesting that vira l shedding in stool could be a potential route of transmission. Post - cleaning samples were negative, sugges ting that current d econtamination measures are sufficient. Pastorino, B. et al. 2020 Prolonged viability of SARS - CoV-2 in fomites . Emerging Infectious Diseases . In conclusion, we showed that a moderate protein concentration in droplets markedly increased the infectivity of SARS -CoV-2, suggesting that a protein rich medium like airway secretions could protect the virus when it is expelled and may enhance its persistence and transmission by contaminated fomites . Accordingly, it is plausible that fomites infected with SARS -CoV-2 play a key role in the indirect transmission of COVID- 19. This finding supports surface cleaning as a necessary action that should be enforced and repeated because it may play a key role in halting SARS -CoV-2 transmission and mitigating the COVID -19 pan demic. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 52 Peng , Shi et al. 2020 The impact of temperature and absolute humidity on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) outbreak - evidence from China . Science of the Total Environment . The number of new confirm ed COVID -19 cases in main land China peaked o n Feb ruary 1, 2020. COVID- 19 daily incidence were lowest at -1 0\u00b0C and highest at 10 \u00b0C, while the maximum incidence was observed at the absolute humidity of approximately 7 g/m3. COVID -19 incidence changed with temperature as daily incidence decreased when the temperature rose. No significant association between COVID -19 incidence and absolute humidity was observed in distributed lag nonlinear models. Additionally, a modified susceptible -exposed -infectious -recovered (M -SEIR) model confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale. The report concludes that t emperature is an environmental driver of the COVID -19 outbreak in China. Lower and highe r temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID -19 incidence. M -SEIR models help to better evaluate environmental and social impacts on COVID -19. Qian, Hua et al. 2020 Indoor transmission of SARS - CoV-2. Indoor Air . 318 outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, in volving 1, 245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53 .8% involved three cases, 26 .4% involved four cases, and only 1 .6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79. 9%), follo wed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbr eaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases. All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor e nvironment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS -CoV-2 infection risk . Qiu, Yun et al. 2020 Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID -19) in China . Journal of Population Economics . We rely on meteorological data to construct instrumental varia bles for the endogenous variables. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, air pressure, average and maximum wind speeds, precipitation, snowfall amount, and dew point for 362 weather station s at the daily level in China. To merge the meteorological variables with the number of new cases of COVID -19, we first calculate daily weather variables for each city on each day from 2019 December to 2020 February from station -level weather records Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 53 follo wing the inverse -distance weighting method. Second, we match the daily weather variables to the number of new cases of COVID -19 based on city name and date. Rabenau, H. et al. 2020 Efficacy of various disinfectants against SARS coronavirus . Journal of Hos pital Infection. Investigated eight disinfectants for their activity against SARS- CoV according to prEN 14476. In summary, SARS- CoV can be inactivated quite easily with many commonly used disinfectants . Riediker , Michael et al. 2020 Estimation of Viral Ae rosol Emissions From Simulated Individuals With Asymptomatic to Moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019. JAMA . The estimated concentratio ns in a room with an individual who was coughing frequently were very high, with a maximum of 7.44 million viral copies/m3 from an individual who was a high emitter. However, regular breathing f rom an individual who was a high emitter was modeled to result in lower room concentrations of up to 1 ,248 copies/m3. Santarpia, J . et al. 2020 Transmission Potential of SARS - CoV-2 in Viral Shedding Observed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center . (Preprint). During the initial isolation of 13 individuals confirmed positive with COVID -19 infection, air and surface samples were collected in 11 isolation rooms to e xami ne viral sheddi ng from isolated individuals. While all individuals were confirmed positive for SARS -CoV-2, symptoms and viral shedding to the environment varied considerabl y. Many commonly used items, toilet facilities, and air samples had evidence of viral contamination , indicating that SARS- CoV-2 is shed to the environment as expired particles, during toileting, and through contact with fomites. Disease spread through both direct (droplet and person- to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airbor ne transmission) are indicated , supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions. Schoen , Lawrence J. 2020 Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID- 19 Pandemic . ASHRAE Journal . Recommendations in this guidance document incl ude: Increase out door air ventilation (use caution in highly polluted areas); with a lower population in the building ; this increases the effective dilution ventilation per person Disable demand -controlled ventilation Further open minimum outdoor a ir dampers, as high as 100%, thus eliminating recirculation (in the mild weather season, this need not affect thermal comfort or humidity, but clearly becomes more difficult in extreme weather) Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 54 Improve central air filtration to the MERV -13 or the highest compatible with t he filter rack, and seal edges of the filter to limit bypass Keep systems running longer hours, if possible 24/7, to enhance the two actions above Consider portable room air cleaners with HEPA filters Consider UVGI (ultraviolet germicidal irradiat ion) protecting occupants from radiation particularly in high -risk spaces such as waiting rooms. Smither , Sophie J . et al. 2020 Experimental Aerosol Survival of SARS -CoV-2 in Artificial Saliva and Tissue . Emerging Microbes and Infections . SARS -CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID -19 pandemic, may be transmitted via airborne droplets or contact with surfaces onto which droplets have deposited. In this study, the ability of SARS- CoV-2 to survive in the dark, at two different relative humidity values and w ithin artificial saliva, a clinically relevant matrix, was investigated. SARS- CoV-2 was found to be stable, in the dark, in a dynamic small particle aerosol u nder the four experimental conditions we tested and viable virus could still be detected after 90 minutes. The decay rate and half -life were determined ; decay rates ranged from 0.4 % to 2.27% per minute and the half -lives ranged from 30 to 177 minutes for t he different conditions. This information can be used for advice and modelling and potent ial mitigation strategies. Stadnytskyi , Valentyn et al. 2020 The airborne lifetime of small speech droplets and their potential importance in SARS - CoV-2 transmission . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic carriers of SARS -CoV-2 are increasingly considered to be a likely mode of disease transmission. Highly sensitive laser light scatte ring observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per sec ond. In a closed, stagnant air environment, they disappear from the window of view with time constants in the range of 8 to 14 min utes , which corres ponds to d roplet nuclei of 4 \u00b5 m diameter, or 12 - to 21 -\u00b5m droplets prior to dehydration. These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments. van Doremalen , Neeltje et al. 2020 Aerosol and surface stability of SARS -CoV-2 compared to SARS - CoV-1. (Preprint). We found t hat the stability of SARS -CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS -CoV-1 under the experimental circumstances tested. This indicates that differences in the epidemiologic characteristics of these viruses probably arise from other factors, including high viral loa ds in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for persons Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 55 infected with SARS -CoV-2 to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic. Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS -CoV-2 is plausible, since the virus can remain via ble and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days (depending on the inoculum shed). These findings echo those with SARS -CoV-1, in which these forms of transmission were associated with nosocomial spread and super - spreadi ng events, and the y provide information for pandemic mitigation efforts. Wang, Mao et al. 2020 Temperature S ignificantly Change COVID- 19 Transmission in 429 C ities. Science of the Total Environment . The study found that, to a certain extent, temperature could significant ly change COVID -19 transmission , and there might be a best temperature for the viral transm ission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and re gions with lower temperatur es adopt the strictest control measu res to prevent future reversal. Wiberg , Drew 2020 COVID -19 In the Built Environment . Science Daily. Aerosolized (airborne) SARS -CoV-2 has been shown to have a half -life of approximately an hour . The virus has a significantly longer half -life once it sett les on surfaces or objects . An increase in outdoor temperature or humidity has not been shown to significantly decrease current infection ra tes. Sufficient UV light has, however, been proven to inactivate the SARS- CoV-2 virus . Copper and cardboard retain v iable SARS - CoV-2 particles with a half -life between 2 and 4 hours. Stainless steel and plastic surfaces retain the virus with a proven half -life of up to 6.5 hours. World Health Organization 2020 Transmission of SARS- CoV-2: implications for of SARS- CoV-2 can occur through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected se cretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions or their respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets are >5 \u00b5m in diameter whereas droplets <5 \u00b5m in diameter are referred to as droplet nuclei or aerosols . Airborne transmission is defined as the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in air over long distances (>6 ft.) and time (several hours). Airborne transmission of SARS- CoV-2 can occur during medical procedures that generate aerosols . World Health Organization , together with the scientific community, has been actively discussing an d evaluating whether SARS -CoV-2 may also spread through aerosols in the absence of aerosol -generating procedures, particularly in indoor settings with poor ventilation . Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 56 Yanfang , Jiang et al. 2020 Clinical Data on Hospital Environmental Hygiene Monitoring and Medical Staff Protection during the Coronavi rus Disease 2019 Outbreak . (Preprint). Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient. Yuwen, Cai et al. 2020 The Effects of \"Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan\" Makeshift Hospitals and Tempera ture on the Mortality of COVID -19. Peer J . Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with temperature both in Wuhan (r = - 0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = - 0.440, P = 0.012). Our findings indicated that both the use of makeshift hospitals and the rise of air temperature were beneficial to the survival of COVID -19 cases. If air temp erature rises 1\u00b0C, the mortality of confirmed cases would decrease 0.44% and the mortality of severe cases would decrease 0.42% on average. Zhang , John et al. 2020 Study of Viral Filtration Performance of Residential HVAC Filters . ASHRAE Journal . Researchers recently carried out an ex perimental study to understand the efficacy and effectiveness of residential HVAC filters at removing airborne virus particles in the airstream. It concluded that high -efficiency residential HVAC filters were effective at capturing airborne virus particles in the air passing through the filter. This study focused on viral filtration of residential HVAC filters with diffe rent minimum efficiency rating values (MERV), e.g., MERV 5 ( 30% removal efficiency, 40- Pa pressure drop), MERV 12 ( 80% removal efficiency, 40- Pa pressure drop), and MERV 14 ( 95% removal efficiency, 60-Pa pressure drop). Nebulizer generators produce droplet aerosols with mass median aerodynamic diameters of 1 \u00b5 m to 3 \u00b5 m. Zhao , Bin et al. 2020 Air purifiers : A supplementary measure to remove a irborne SARS -CoV-2. (Preprint). As measured by Liu et al., the peak concentration of SARS -CoV-2 aerosols appears in two distinct size ranges, one in the submicron region with aerodynamic diameter dominant between 0.25 and 1.0 \u00b5 m, and the other peak in supe rmicron region with diameter larger than 2.5 \u00b5 m. Such aerosols just fall in the size range that can be effectively re moved by air purifiers. Most air purifiers employ HEPA filters for particles filtration ; the filtration efficiencies of HEPA are high enoug h to remove su ch virus - laden aerosols. According to our previous measurements, t he efficiencies of HEPA are Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 57 more than 95% for aerosols of diameter between 0.25 and 1.0 \u00b5m and nearly 100% for those with diameter larger than 2.5 \u00b5m. Zhu, Y. et al. 2020 On a Statistical Transmission Model in Analys is of the Early Phase of COVID - 19 Ou tbreak . Statistics in Biosciences . This study introduced a statistical disease transmission model using case symptom onset data to estimate the transmissibility of the early -phas e outbreak in China, and provided sensitivity analyses with various assumptions of disease natural history of the COVID -19. We f itted the transmission model to several publicly available sources of the outbreak data until 11, February 2020, and estimated lock down intervention efficacy of Wuhan city. The estimated R0 was between 2.7 and 4.2 from plausible distributio n assumptions of the incubation period and relative infectivity over the infectious period. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 58 Appendix B . Test Results (Heat Maps) Heat maps illustrating the mobility and concentration of DNA- coded tracer aerosol for each test in each test space are shown in Figures A1 -A8. The designation OP 1-16 represents 16 total aerosol release points in four areas ( two resident rooms, staff room, and corridor ) for each test space (control and experimental) tested at 30% and 100% outdoor air. Similarly, the designation SP1-48 represents 48 aerosol sampling points in four areas of each test space tested at 30% and 100% outdoor air, respectively. Aerosol concentrations are denoted by color code (red - high, blue - low) and by the l og 10 reduction in aerosol concentration as related to the number of DNA copies required by PCR to detect the presence of the tracer aerosol (1 - high, 6 - low). Figures A9-A10 provide a summary comparing the effect of 30% and 100% outdoor air for each sampling point in each test space. Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 59 Figure A -1.

Mitigation Technolog ies According to ASHRAE (2020), transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the air is sufficiently likely that airborne exposure to the virus should be controlled. Changes in building operations, including the operation of HVAC systems, can reduce airborne exposures . As part of the facility's emergency operation plan, procedural measures and engineering controls should be considered with respect to exis ting facility capabilities and capabilities to incorporate temporary mitigation technologies. In addition to temporary isolation measures that provide added ventilation, directional airflow, and physical separation, mitigation technologies may also include enhanced air filtration in combination with active and passive carbon, polar ionization, photocatalytic oxidation, and other UV germicidal irradiation technologies . These technologies may be incorporated within existing HVAC systems or provided by ceiling/wall-mounted or portable in-room systems. The use of highly efficient particle filtration can reduce the airborne load of infectious particles. HEPA filters with a MERV of 19 can remove 99.9% of particles greater than or equal to 0.3 \u00b5m , which includes most viruses, bacteria, molds, and volatile organic compounds. The use of high- efficiency filters can , however, diminish the amount of air supplied to the room and c ause more air to bypass the filter. In poorly mixed spaces, areas of the room may receive li ttle if any recirculated air and filtration. UV light can kill or inactiv ate microorganisms within HVAC systems and resident rooms, but long- term exposure can caus e damage to the eyes and skin. Included next is a listing of 15 advanced air filtration and air cleaning technologies beyond the minimum MERV -7 requirement that have the potential to mitigate exposure to COVID-19 and other respirator y diseases in skilled nursing facilities and similar residential car e environments. For each technology, removal efficiency is presented, along with energy requirements, impact to existing systems, cost, and operations and maintenance requirements.Ventilation in Residential Care Environments 70 TECHNOLOGYFiltration Below 1 MicronFiltration Below 0.5 MicronFiltration Below 0.3 MicronBacteria, Virus, Mold, Protozoa Airborne Disinfection (2)Mold, Complex Bacteria Surface Disinfection IAQVolatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Removal Odor Removal Smoke RemovalOzone Generation More Than 50 ppb* (UL 867)Ozone Generation 5 ppb* (UL 2998) Passive Filtration (MERV 8)0%-10% zero zero zero none none none none no no Passive Filtration (MERV 13)70% 55% -60% zeromold, larger 99.97% 20%-30%mold, bacteria, protozoa, large no no Passive Filtration (MERV 19-20)99.9995% 99.9995% 99.999% All (except small virus) TRAPS, and deactivate over timenone none high high no no Passsive Carbon Filtration0 0 0 none none average average average no no Activated Carbon Filtration0 0 0 very little none high high high no no Polarized Media\u2014 2\" V Bank97% 90% 40%mold, larger protozoa (TRAP and over time)none high average average no no Polarized w/ Integral UVC V Bank97% 90% 40%mold, and deactivate)yes high highbetter than averageno noVentilation in Residential Care Environments 71 TECHNOLOGYFiltration Below 1 MicronFiltration Below 0.5 MicronFiltration Below 0.3 MicronBacteria, Virus, Mold, Protozoa Airborne Disinfection (2)Mold, Complex Bacteria Surface Disinfection IAQVolatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Removal Odor Removal Smoke RemovalOzone Generation More Than 50 ppb* (UL 867)Ozone Generation (MERV15)99.97% virus) traps and deactivate over timenone high high high no no UV Light\u2014Low Intensity (Coil Cleaning)0 0 0 none yes none none none no no UV Light\u2014High Intensity (Custom Engineered Irradiance)0 0 0all (custom engineered intensity) kill and deactivateyes high none none no no Bi Polar Ionization Tubes0 0 0all (custom engineered configuration) kill and deactivateyes (if upstream of coil)high high avg-high yes yes PCO\u2014 PhotoCatalytic Oxidization0 0 0all (custom engineered configuration) must be high intensity, kill and deactivatenone high high avg-high configuration) must be high intensity (kill and deactivate)none high high avg-high no no Needle Point Bi Polar Ionization0 0 0all (custom engineered configuration) kill and deactivateyes (if upstream of coil)high high avg-high no no Notes: * Ozone is part of EPA non-attainment outdoor air concentration compound.
