Alternative practitioners believe it offers many health benefits. The plant is recognized by its jagged, tooth-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, mauve or pale-purple blossoms. Rich in plant-based compounds known as flavonoids, vervain is thought to have potent anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antispasmodic, and analgesic (pain-relieving) effects. There are even those who contend that vervain has anti-tumor properties that can help fight cancer. This article describes the potential benefits of vervain, including what the current research says about this popular herbal remedy. It also explains the possible risks and side effects of vervain supplements and to how them safely. Also Known As American blue verbena Simpler's joy Holy herb Mosquito plant Wild hyssop M bin co (traditional Chinese medicine) Dietary supplements are not regulated in the United States, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement that has been tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF.However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn't mean that they are necessarily safe for all people or effective in general. Therefore, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check any potential interactions with other supplements or medications. Supplement Facts Active ingredient(s): VervainAlternate name(s): Verbena status: Available the counter (OTC)Suggested dose: No official recommended dosageSafety considerations: Avoid during pregnancy and lactation Uses of Vervain Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, pharmacist, or doctor. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease. A group of homeopathic tinctures developed in the 1930s called Bach Flower Remedies includes 38 flowering plants, including vervain. These products are still sold today. Alternative practitioners tout vervain's anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antispasmodic, and analgesic (pain-relieving) properties. People use vervain to relieve anxiety and depression, aches and pains, sleep issues, and reduce cancer risk. As with many homeopathic remedies, some health claims are better supported by research than others. 1:42 Click Play to Learn More About Vervain This video has been medically reviewed by Meredith Bull, ND. Anxiety and Depression The verbenalin in vervain, an iridoid glycoside known for its calming effects, has prompted some research on the herb's potential for reducing anxiety and depression. A 2016 animal study published in the Frontiers of Pharmacology looked at how vervain impacted several factors, including anxiety. Researchers found that mice who received a vervain extract dose of 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) had the highest anti-anxiety effect measured by movement through a maze. However, when the dosage was higher\u2014300 mg/kg\u2014the effect was reduced, likely due to sedative effects at a higher dosage. In addition, a 2020 animal study in Basic and Clinical Neuroscience evaluated the antidepressant effects of vervain. Researchers found that rats that received 200 mg/kg vervain extract by oral administration experienced an an antidepressant effect, shown by significantly decreased immobility time, increased time spent in light, and the number of entries into central maze squares. Since researchers conducted these studies on rodents, it is uncertain whether the results would translate similarly to humans. Therefore, more research is needed. Insomnia The calming effect of compounds in vervain has similarly prompted research on the plant's potential in helping those with insomnia. In the 2016 study referenced above, researchers looked at the sedative properties of vervain. When the researchers gave mice a 50-300 mg/kg dose of an extract of vervain, they noticed an increase in sedative effects with increasing dosage. Mice who received vervain had decreased sleep onset and increased sleep duration. Since researchers conducted this study on mice, it's unclear whether these benefits would transfer to humans. Therefore, more research is needed. Seizures Again, the sedative nature of vervain's compounds has prompted research on the herb's anticonvulsant potential. In the above-referenced 2016 study, researchers also examined the anticonvulsant activities of vervain in mice. Researchers noticed a dose-dependent response in mice who received 100-500 mg/kg of vervain extract. In addition, mice dosed with vervain had delayed onset and decreased duration time of tonic-clonic seizures (a classic seizure with unconsciousness and limb jerking). As with the other study results, it's unclear whether the same benefits could be applied to humans. So, more research is needed. Infections Treating infectious diseases has become increasingly challenging because of growing antibiotic resistance. Vervain's antimicrobial properties have prompted research on the herb's possible role in overcoming these challenges. In a 2016 study in Cogent Chemistry, researchers examined the antimicrobial potential of vervain. Scientists evaluated different parts of vervain against 24 strains of disease-causing bacteria. According to the research: Extracts derived from the stem of V. officinalis killed bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the test tube more effectively than the antibiotic amoxicillin. Similarly, the plant's leaves showed considerable activity against the bacterium Citrobacter freundii. The root turned out to be highly effective against the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. This research was conducted in test tubes, so more research is needed to see if the same results would occur in humans. Colorectal Cancer Flavonoids, antioxidants found in vervain, reduce oxidization and gene mutations. Therefore, some researchers have looked at the herb's anticancer potential, specifically in colorectal cancer. A 2017 laboratory study published in the Tropical Journal of Pharmaceutical Research examined how polysaccharides (a type of long-chain carbohydrate) extracted from vervain affected colorectal cancer cells. Researchers found that an extract of V. officinalis polysaccharides significantly inhibited cell invasion and migration and significantly decreased cell adhesion. Other In addition to the potential health benefits listed above, some people use vervain to support: Headaches General aches and pain Digestive dysfunction Upper respiratory tract symptoms There is little research available to support these uses. What Are the Side Effects of Vervain? Your healthcare provider may recommend vervain for stress reduction or sleep. However, consuming an herb like vervain may have potential side effects. The common side effects are generally mild, but there can also be severe side effects. Common Side Effects The FDA considers vervain \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) as a food.
