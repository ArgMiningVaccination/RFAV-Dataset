Perkins, MD, of Boston University, and her associates. Of 387,906 adolescent females, 8% received 1 dose of HPV vaccine, 9% received 2 doses, 31% received 3 doses, and 52% remained unvaccinated. The mean age of the girls in the study was 15 years, and average length of follow-up was 6 years. The girls were aged 9-18 years on Jan.1, 2007, and the exposure period began at that time for unvaccinated girls or on the date of the last HPV vaccine injection for those receiving the vaccine. Among girls receiving more than 1 dose, 60% received their second dose within 3 months of their first dose (on time), and 47% received their third dose within 5 months of their second dose. \"Although reductions in genital warts are an important early marker of vaccine effectiveness, reductions in cervical dysplasia and cancers are far more important vaccine-related outcomes,\" Dr. Perkins and her associates said. \"Human papillomavirus vaccine protection must last many years to provide adequate cancer protection, therefore ongoing studies are paramount,\" they noted. The study used data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims Database, covering enrollees and dependents from about half of provider-sponsored U.S. health insurance plans.
