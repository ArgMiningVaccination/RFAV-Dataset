I had not been that surprised when some anthroposophical friends and others with interests in so-called alternative medicines had touted the virtues of homeopathy. But when my friend, Joan L., who works in the health-care industry -- the high-tech, mainstream, regular-medicine health-care industry -- told me that not only had she used homeopathic remedies for her allergies and colds, but also had given her daughter homeopathic medicine for a sore throat (It worked! Overnight!), I was shaken. This was a woman with whom I had shared long hypochondriacal conversations about heart disease, brain tumors and food poisoning, all based on the best available scientific evidence. Yet here she was advocating a system of medicine -- based on treatment with very dilute doses of natural materials, which in larger quantities would cause the same symptoms that ail you -- that is inexplicable by modern science. \"But it works,\" she said, and cited a paper in The British Journal of Medicine (we often trade citations in conversation). Further investigation revealed that almost everyone I knew either had used a homeopathic remedy or knew someone who did. Drugstores that a few years ago were carrying only mainstream products like Nyquil and Sudafed were displaying homeopathic lines in their windows. And not in amber bottles, but in small, colorful cardboard containers with the pills comfortably ensconced in blister packs. There was Quietude -- \"the homeopathic insomnia remedy in a white box with blue and pink pastel borders.\" And Alpha CF, for colds and flu, in an icy-blue package with a snowflake design. I was not the only one to notice that homeopathy was in vogue and visually more attractive than ever. A newspaper article about an up-and-coming bicoastal style monger named Andre Balazs noted that a feature planned for the ultra-chic Manhattan hotel he's building is a homeopathic pharmacy. If it does well, Balazs envisions a chain. This would obviously please the homeopathic pharmaceutical companies, which are already undergoing a renaissance. Old companies are reviving, and new companies are getting into the field, which in the late 1970's and early 1980's made a miraculous recovery from near death. According to the Food and Drug Administration, sales of some homeopathic drug companies increased 1,000 percent. Growth has continued apace ever since, with the American market for homeopathic drugs now estimated at $100 million. Europe's two biggest homeopathic pharmaceutical companies have moved into the United States, each acquiring a struggling old American firm. Boiron L.H.F., of France, a publicly held company, bought Borneman & Sons of Philadelphia in 1983. In 1987 the privately owned Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Company, of Germany, purchased Boericke & Tafel, another Philadelphia company, founded in 1825, and in 1990 moved it into a new, state-of-the-art production facility in Santa Rosa, Calif. Both companies report that gross sales have increased by more than 20 percent a year, a claim matched by Standard Homeopathic Company, an old-line California firm. New to the homeopathic market is Nature's Way Products Inc., a manufacturer of food supplements, which describes itself as \"America's Natural Health Care Company.\" The full-page magazine advertisements trumpeting its new line of homeopathic medicines assure consumers that they \"work a lot like vaccines\" and are easy to use. \"If my back hurts, I get the remedy labeled for injury and backache, and there's one for arthritis, PMS, colds or whatever. It's simple.\" So simple, in fact, that there is a remedy labeled simply \"Allergy.\" Imagine -- medicines that have no side effects, so safe that a child could swallow an entire bottle of pills, yet able to cure pesky ailments like fatigue, insomnia and allergy that have baffled modern medicine. How could such medicines be produced? What went into them? What was my friend Joan getting into? Boericke & Tafel's brand-new headquarters seemed the best place to look on the new face of homeopathy, so I flew to San Francisco and then drove north to Santa Rosa. The plant was spanking clean, just the way you want a pharmaceutical plant to be. In the laboratorylike production rooms, everyone (including me) wore white coats, surgical masks and gloves and disposable caps. The workers also put on special white shoes, which they wore only while in these areas. Visitors and all other personnel were given covers for theirs. (The last time I had seen people dressed this way was at my son's birth.) In one area a tablet-making machine was busy making tablets. In another, the tincture storage room, there were scores of amber bottles on stainless-steel racks, all very pharmaceutical. But there was no amoxycillin or Prozac, no Xanax or AZT. Instead there were tinctures of ivy), Berberis vulgaris (barberry) Calendula officinalis (marigold) was macerating in what seemed to be large stainless-steel stockpots. Next we entered the \"single remedy room,\" where medicines were actually being produced. First the technician weighed out a gram's worth of drops from one bottle of Natrum muriaticum 25X. Otherwise known as sodium chloride or table salt, the Natrum muriaticum had been diluted 25 times at a ratio of 1 to 10, leaving 1 part salt to 10 to the 25th power parts of alcohol and water (10 followed by 25 zeros, a number so high that the name used to describe it is a \"googol\"). After each dilution the solution was shaken 10 times by hand and banged against a rubber pad, a process known in homeopathy as \"succussion.\" In homeopathy this process of diluting, shaking and banging is known as \"potentizing.\" In homeopathic speak the solution was at 25X potency. To this already ethereal solution the technician added more liquid to dilute it 1 to 10 once again. She then succussed the solution by shaking it 10 times by hand (up and down) and banging it against a rubber pad on each down stroke. The solution was now Natrum muriaticum 26X. She repeated the same procedure again to produce a 27X solution. The final steps (done later) would be to repeat the dilution and succussion process three more times to achieve Natrum muriaticum 30X. Then drops of this solution of 1 part salt to 10 to the 30th power parts liquid would be added to sugar tablets, resulting in a product reputedly useful for allergy, anemia, cardiovascular problems and grieving states. As I watched this process I heard within me the whimper of offended reason. By all known laws of physics and chemistry, the initial preparation had been diluted so many times that it was highly unlikely that a measurable trace of salt remained, not a molecule. And this was before the five succeeding dilutions, and the final dosing of the sugar pellets. What was being created, it seemed, was not a drug, but the idea of a drug, what an artist friend of mine calls \"conceptual medicine.\" I thought, Welcome to homeopathy. FEW PEOPLE WHO BUY the new over-the-counter homeopathic remedies realize that homeopathy is not herbal or Chinese medicine. It is not naturopathy, osteopathy or acupuncture, not bodywork, shiatsu or chiropractic. Homeopathy was developed by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), and began to flourish in Europe, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. According to the National Center for Homeopathy, a promotional organization with 6,500 members, 32 percent of family physicians in France and 20 percent in Germany prescribe homeopathic medicines, while in Great Britain 42 percent sometimes refer patients to homeopaths. In France, where the best-selling flu remedy, Oscillococcinum, is homeopathic, the national health-care system covers homeopathic prescriptions from traditional physicians. Homeopathy's popularity surged in this country after the Civil War, then faded early in this century. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \"The Social Transformation of American Medicine,\" Paul Starr says homeopaths \"won a share in the legal privileges of the profession.\" He wrote: \"Only afterward did they lose their popularity. When homeopathic and eclectic doctors were shunned and denounced by the regular profession, they thrived.\" Opinions differ as to its demise. Homeopaths say it was squeezed out by the American Medical Association, while others hold that its popularity waned because regular medicine worked better. In 1900, there were 22 homeopathic medical schools here; in 1918 there were 6, and now there are none, which makes homeopathy's revival all the more remarkable. One reason for homeopathy's new-found popularity is its focus on the individual. Homeopathic physicians traditionally spend considerable time finding a unique cure for each person. This is in direct and appealing contrast to the medical assembly lines many patients find themselves going through nowadays. A visit to a homeopathic physician should involve not only the traditional physical exam (blood pressure, blood tests and so on) and the standard medical history, but also at least an hourlong consultation with very thorough questions about the patient's complaints and general health. Even in the realm of self-help, the same attitude prevails. Boericke & Tafel's \"Family Guide to Self-Medication\" has something of the appeal of a book of medical horoscopes. Deadly nightshade, for instance, is recommended for colds and flu, but look under the \"Comments\" column: \"Patient is overly excited and sensitive.\" Wild rosemary is good for a range of ills, including \"rheumatism that starts in the feet,\" \"black eyes\" and \"chronic bronchitis.\" It is particularly \"suitable for pale, delicate persons who always feel cold and chilly.\" Naturally I went looking for what remedy would be good for me. There was no doubt: Nux vomica, otherwise known as poison nut, a plant from which strychnine can be extracted. \"Preeminent for many conditions of modern life. Typical patient is thin, active, nervous, lives a sedentary life with much mental strain.\" Well, I used to be thin. IN DESCRIBING THE early practitioners, Paul Starr says, \"Hahnemann and his followers saw disease fundamentally as a matter of spirit; what occurred inside the body did not follow physical laws.\" Today the emphasis is on the principles of medicine Hahnemann developed. Perhaps the most well known of these is the \"law of similars,\" or \"like cures like,\" which holds that the same substance that in large doses causes the symptoms that plague you, in small doses will cure you. To prove this Hahnemann used cinchona, which was already a known treatment for malaria. Hoping to induce the symptomatic chills and fever of malaria, he took large doses of cinchona, which produced the desired results. Using that as evidence for the rule, he conducted other experimental \"provings\" of different substances to identify other potential cures. He then instructed his followers to use the drug or treatment that \"in effect\" matched the patient's symptoms. Furthermore, Hahnemann said, and modern homeopaths have agreed, that the smaller the dose, the stronger the remedy, but only if the preparation is vigorously shaken after each dilution, the theory being that dilution plus succussion somehow \"potentizes\" a remedy. A dilution of 1 part in 10 is 1X, 1 part in 100 is 1C. At roughly 12C or 24X, which is to say 1 part in 10 to the 24th, conventional chemistry holds that there is no measurable amount of the original substance left. But homeopaths do not stop at 24X; some go up to 1,000 or 50,000. The highest dilutions of homeopathic medicines -- despite having the least amount of the active ingredient, or ingredients -- are supposed to be the most potent and are commonly used for mental or emotional problems. Conversely, lower dilutions, like 1X or 6X, which characterize most over-the-counter medicines, contain higher amounts of the active ingredient, but are considered less potent. Most prepackaged remedies are for aches, pains, allergies and colds, but some promise more. Boericke & Tafel, for instance, markets something called Alfalco. An alfalfa tonic that comes in a four-ounce bottle, it is recommended for temporary relief of tension, anxiety, sleeplessness, mental and physical fatigue, abnormal appetite and fatigue following illness. Alfalco has nine homeopathic ingredients, including cinchona 2X, sodium phosphate 6X and formic acid 3X, and one ingredient in a nonhomeopathic dose, alcohol. A saleswoman at a Santa Rosa pharmacy told me, \"We've got a couple of old ladies that swear by it.\" No doubt they're after the cinchona and are unaware that Alfaco is 14 percent alcohol (28 proof), 1 percent more than the chardonnay I bought at a Sonoma wine shop. Of course, both are considerably less potent than Nyquil, which weighs in at a hefty 25 percent alcohol. In terms of price, most over-the-counter homeopathic drugs seem comparable with traditional remedies. For instance, Oscilloccinum, made from infinitesimal amounts of amino acids from the heart and liver of the Barbary duck, sells at about $10.99 for six tubes, with three the recommended treatment for flu. Alpha CF -- derived from monkshood, white bryony, eucalyptus, boneset, yellow jasmine and ipecac -- sells for about $6.50 for 40 tablets. By contrast, at a pharmacy near me, Tylenol Cold cost $5.33 for 24 caplets and Nyquil $5.29 for six fluid ounces. Homeopathic medicines are considered drugs by the F.D.A., but minimally regulated. By law, all new drugs must be tested for safety and efficacy. So far the F.D.A. has chosen not to enforce this provision for homeopathic drugs, because their harmlessness is generally accepted. In 1988 the F.D.A. did issue labeling and packaging guidelines, and defined what homeopathic drugs could be sold over the counter (essentially, those marketed for what are called self-limiting conditions, like the common cold). Although many critics challenge the efficacy of homeopathic remedies, to date the F.D.A. has chosen not to give them priority. Daniel L. Michels, director of the Office of Compliance of the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, emphasizes that this hands-off approach \"is not to say these products are effective.\" Perhaps the most vocal critic of homeopathy is William T. Jarvis, president of the National Council Against Health Fraud, an organization that is death on everything from health food to acupuncture. Jarvis says proponents of homeopathy are either \"stupid\" or \"deliberately fraudulent.\" Claiming that \"the F.D.A. has let the public down\" by failing to make homeopathic medicines prove their safety and efficacy as do other drugs, he says, \"If we had the money we would sue them.\" Consumer Reports has also called for testing of homeopathic medicines. Some parts of the medical establishment, in contrast, seem content to ignore homeopathy. Although some homeopathic doctors are associated with teaching hospitals, at one major urban institution, Massachussetts General, the public affairs office was unable to find a single physician who knew or cared enough about homeopathy to comment on it. At Johns Hopkins, none of the people named by the public affairs office wanted to discuss homeopathy. Only three states -- Connecticut, Arizona and Nevada -- specifically license physicians to practice homeopathy. For example, in Connecticut, board certification is required. In the rest of the country, physicians, dentists, naturopaths, acupuncturists and others already licensed by their states as health practitioners can call themselves homeopaths without obtaining an explicit license to do so. They can suggest and dispense over-the-counter remedies to patients if their licenses allow it. For example, one state might license someone as an acupuncturist and allow her to dispense over-the-counter remedies, while in another state that would be illegal. Anyone practicing homeopathy without the requisite license is subject to prosecution according to state law. The National Center for Homeopathy estimates that the number of homeopathic physicians has grown from less than 100 in the early 70's to about 2,500, and the overwhelming majority of them practice homeopathy in conjunction with regular medicine. The center also claims that 3,000 to 5,000 licensed health professionals also practice homeopathy, among them dentists, nurse practitioners, naturopaths and acupuncturists. The American Institute of Homeopathy does offer a certification examination for M.D.'s and osteopaths, and there are other professional organizations that provide a certification process for practitioners of homeopathy. The states of Washington and Alaska have recently passed legislation protecting doctors who prescribe unconventional treatments, but elsewhere confrontations have emerged. The case of a North Carolina physician, Dr. George Guess, has been in the courts since 1986. The dispute began when the state board of medical examiners instituted proceedings to take the doctor's license unless he stopped practicing homeopathic medicine, which they argued did not meet the standards of accepted medical practice. He had been permitted to continue practicing homeopathy pending resolution of a lawsuit filed by several of his patients that challenges the board's action. This summer the court withdrew that permission. As a result, his patients are left without the services of the state's only practicing homeopath, and Dr. Guess has said he will leave North Carolina rather than stop practicing homeopathy. North Carolina's medical board never raised the real questions: Is homeopathy effective? And if so, how does it work? Every proponent of homeopathy I spoke to admitted that no one knew how homeopathy achieved its effects. For example, Thierry R. Montfort, president of Boiron, says, \"We still don't know how to explain the mechanism of action.\" Beverly Rubik, director of the Center for Frontier Sciences at Temple University, which publishes research on homeopathy, acknowledges, \"Nobody knows how it works.\" There is only speculation on the mechanism of action. Dana Ullman, author of \"Discovering Homeopathy\" and board member of the National Center for Homeopathy, suggests that even in the lowest doses, \"something remains: the essence of the substance, its resonance, its energy, its pattern.\" He also mentions a possible interaction with the life force \"similar to what the Chinese call chi.\" According to Rubik, the homeopathic \"signal\" may be \"informational and electromagnetic in nature.\" There is also some controversial research, trumpeted by homeopaths and challenged by most mainstream scientists, that purports to show that if shaken properly, water can have a \"memory\" of what was in it. Joel Gurin, science editor of Consumer Reports, a critic of homeopathy, doesn't think most people understand \"the enormity\" of what homeopathic theory asks one to believe. He says: \"One must believe that water in some way undefined by modern science, has a memory which can be changed in a meaningful way by progressive dilution and shaking. That this 'trace resonance' in the water has a biological effect, and that all these remarkable and challenging facts were observed by a lone German physician a couple of hundred years ago. To me that's a big leap of faith.\" But how homeopathy works is not the issue on which modern homeopaths want to take their stand. Never mind the mechanism (for now), homeopaths say, the stuff works. Look at 200 years of satisfied patients and convinced physicians, like Dr. Bill Gray, who has been using homeopathy for 21 years. Co-founder of the Hahnemann College of Homeopathy in Albany, Calif., which offers homeopathic training for health professionals, Gray became convinced of homeopathy's value during a flu epidemic in 1971. He says he treated 40 patients homeopathically, and 37 were cured within 12 hours, while recovery for those patients he treated traditionally took much longer. Gray claims to have successfully treated schizophrenia, Krohn's disease, multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome with homeopathic medicines. But, like many of his colleagues, Gray says, \"It would be irresponsible for a homeopath not to resort to allopathic [ regular ] medicine if he were not getting results.\" He uses all the standard diagnostic tools -- \"We're not flakes working on the energy plane.\" In Santa Rosa, I visited Dr. Michael Carlston, a homeopath who, in addition to having a family practice, is assistant clinical professor in the department of family and community medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. In this capacity he directs a university-associated homeopathic teaching clinic in Santa Rosa. Carlston's modern office would put at ease anyone who is capable of feeling that way in a doctor's office. Like Gray, he uses conventional medicine when he thinks it is appropriate. Mostly, however, he uses homeopathic medicines, with which he claims to have successfully treated schizophrenics and patients with Lyme disease, AIDS and other serious illnesses. Anecdotes like these are not convincing, say the critics. Many people recover from ailments without any treatment. There is unconscious bias in evaluating the success of one's own treatments. There is the placebo effect, in which the belief of patient and doctor can produce astonishing results even if the pill or other remedy is completely ineffective. In response, homeopaths point to a number of recent experimental studies. They refer most often to a 1991 analysis in The British Medical Journal by several Dutch physicians of 107 clinical studies. Most of the experimental results (81) were positive, that is, the studies reported the homeopathic treatment to have been successful. But most of the experimental procedures were flawed: patients were not always chosen randomly; there were not enough patients, or those analyzing the results had an unconscious bias, because they knew which patients were taking a placebo and which were taking the homeopathic remedy. Still, among the better studies, 15 out of 23 showed positive results. The authors showed some puzzlement. They pointed out that there was \"no plausible explanation of the mechanisms through which homeopathy would act,\" and that to accept the principles of homeopathy, \"essential concepts of modern physics would have to be dismissed.\" On the other hand, they were surprised by the positive results, and said, \"Based on this evidence, we would be ready to accept that homeopathy can be efficacious, if only the mechanism of action were more plausible.\" They concluded that the evidence for homeopathy was not definitive, but that there was a case for further evaluation \"by means of well-performed controlled trials.\" I called Dr. Jerome Kassirer, the editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, who agreed to look over several papers homeopaths cited as good examples of research: one on allergies, another on arthritis and the overall analysis in The British Medical Journal. Kassirer was not impressed. In the arthritis study, he said, the patients were not randomly assigned, the blinding of doctors and patients as to which was the medicine and which the placebo may not have been effective, and the most significant effects were on subjective criteria. In short, he said, it was \"a paper that would never pass muster at The Journal.\" The allergy study published in The Lancet by Dr. David Taylor Reilly, a prominent physician from Glasgow who also practices homeopathy, seemed well designed, and well carried out. The only criticism Kassirer had was that the findings of reduced hay fever symptoms from the homeopathic dose were what he called a \"soft outcome,\" because the symptom evaluations were subjective. As to the review most often cited by homeopaths in The British Medical Journal, Kassirer viewed the limited positive evidence presented as small counterweight to \"the fact that there is no plausible causal link between what they're doing and any known mechanism of disease.\" Indeed, the report left him \"exceptionally skeptical\" of any value in homeopathic medicines. Dr. Stephen E. Goldfinger, editor in chief of The Harvard Health Letter, who read the same papers, had a similar reaction. He saw nothing to convince him of homeopathy's effectiveness. There are, of course, other papers, one on the flu remedy Oscillococcinum, for instance, that seem very positive. But what Kassirer and Goldfinger are saying is that for the drastic theoretical revision of chemistry and physics that homeopathy demands, one needs more than a few studies. However, they say they would welcome more carefully designed studies of homeopathic medicines. In the end, you are left with a puzzle -- experiments of disputed value, anecdotal evidence. The anecdotes are most suggestive. Why, after all, do so many patients and doctors have so many accounts of successful treatment with homeopathic medicines? Are they making the stories up? Are all of the accounts examples of the placebo effect? In fact, it is quite curious that the placebo effect is so maligned: regular physicians scoff at homeopathy, saying it's merely the placebo effect. Proponents of homeopathy insist that the positive results they see cannot be merely the placebo effect. Dr. Herbert Benson, Harvard Medical School's first Mind/Body Medical Institute professor, has been studying the placebo effect for 25 years. He believes many alternative medical treatments like homeopathy achieve results through it. The effect is, he says, extraordinarily powerful, a testament to the power of the mind to heal. Among the studies of the placebo effect that Benson cites, one was done with pregnant women who were nauseated. They were given ipecac (which is commonly used to cause vomiting), but told it was something that would cure their nausea. It did by both subjective and objective measures. Their belief was enough to override the known physical effect of ipecac. (This is not \"like cures like\"; the dose was not homeopathic.) In another study, heart-attack survivors were divided into two groups. One was given a drug to prevent future heart attacks and another a placebo. The drug did turn out to be more useful than the placebo, but Benson points to another aspect of the study. During its course, among the patients assigned to take the real drug, those who did not take their medication died at 2.6 times the rate of those who did. This might be expected. The surprise was that the same ratio held true in the placebo group. That is, among the patients taking useless, phony medication, those who didn't take it had a much worse death rate than those who did. Dr. Benson points out that this result was more than symptom relief; it involved life and death. He suggests that we ought to spend a good deal more energy than we do on figuring out how to use the placebo effect. I asked Dr. Reilly, who did the homeopathic hay fever study, about Benson's position. Reilly, a senior lecturer in medicine at Glasgow University, says he set out to investigate homeopathy on precisely the notion that it was a particularly elaborate system of inducing the placebo effect (which he says would be more respected if it were renamed \"the self-healing effect\"). But, he says, his research \"failed miserably\" at proving that the placebo effect was occurring. \"Let's be clear.\" says Reilly. \"The contemporary understanding of healing and illness is in its infancy.\" He believes that the positive results of his work and of other experiments require explanation. Reilly makes a good argument: In this morass of data and disagreement there is something worth pursuing, whether it is new information about self-healing, about what constitutes proper research design or about homeopathy. Says Reilly, \"The subject has reached the point where it can no longer be ignored.\" As for my personal investigation, I can't offer any anecdotal evidence on one side or the other. I was willing to try homeopathic medicine, but since I started looking into the subject I haven't been sick, which, I suppose, suggests a whole other line of "}
