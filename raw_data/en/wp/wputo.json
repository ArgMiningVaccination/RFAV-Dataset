INTRODUCTION 1. History of Use of Traditional Herbal Medicines By definition, 'traditional' use of herbal medicines implies substantial historical use, and this is certainly true for many products that are available as 'traditional herbal medi-cines'. In many developing countries, a large proportion of the population relies on tradi-tional practitioners and their armamentarium of medicinal plants in order to meet healthcare needs. Although modern medicine may exist side-by-side with such traditionalpractice, herbal medicines have often maintained their popularity for historical andcultural reasons. Such products have become more widely available commercially, espe-cially in developed countries. In this modern setting, ingredients are sometimes marketedfor uses that were never contemplated in the traditional healing systems from which theyemerged. An example is the use of ephedra (= Ma huang) for weight loss or athleticperformance enhancement (Shaw, 1998). While in some countries, herbal medicines aresubject to rigorous manufacturing standards, this is not so everywhere. In Germany, forexample, where herbal products are sold as 'phytomedicines', they are subject to thesame criteria for efficacy, safety and quality as are other drug products. In the USA, bycontrast, most herbal products in the marketplace are marketed and regulated as dietarysupplements, a product category that does not require pre-approval of products on thebasis of any of these criteria. These matters are covered extensively in Section 3 below. 1.1 The role of herbal medicines in traditional healing The pharmacological treatment of disease began long ago with the use of herbs (Schulz et al., 2001). Methods of folk healing throughout the world commonly used herbs as part of their tradition. Some of these traditions are briefly described below,providing some examples of the array of important healing practices around the worldthat used herbs for this purpose. 1.1.1 Traditional Chinese medicine Traditional Chinese medicine has been used by Chinese people from ancient times. Although animal and mineral materials have been used, the primary source of remediesis botanical. Of the more than 12 000 items used by traditional healers, about 500 are incommon use (Li, 2000). Botanical products are used only after some kind of processing, -43-which may include, for example, stir-frying or soaking in vinegar or wine. In clinical practice, traditional diagnosis may be followed by the prescription of a complex andoften individualized remedy. Traditional Chinese medicine is still in common use in China. More than half the population regularly uses traditional remedies, with the highest prevalence of use in ruralareas. About 5000 traditional remedies are available in China; they account for approxi-mately one fifth of the entire Chinese pharmaceutical market (Li, 2000). 1.1.2 Japanese traditional medicine Many herbal remedies found their way from China into the Japanese systems of traditional healing. Herbs native to Japan were classified in the first pharmacopoeia ofJapanese traditional medicine in the ninth century (Saito, 2000). 1.1.3 Indian traditional medicine Ayurveda is a medical system primarily practised in India that has been known for nearly 5000 years. It includes diet and herbal remedies, while emphasizing the body,mind and spirit in disease prevention and treatment (Morgan, 2002). 1.2 Introduction of traditional herbal medicines into Europe, the USA and other developed countries The desire to capture the wisdom of traditional healing systems has led to a resur- gence of interest in herbal medicines (Tyler, 2000), particularly in Europe and NorthAmerica, where herbal products have been incorporated into so-called 'alternative','complementary', 'holistic' or 'integrative' medical systems. During the latter part of the twentieth century, increasing interest in self-care resulted in an enormous growth in popularity of traditional healing modalities, including the useof herbal remedies; this has been particularly true in the USA. Consumers have reportedpositive attitudes towards these products, in large part because they believe them to be of'natural' rather than 'synthetic' origin, they believe that such products are more likely tobe safe than are drugs, they are considered part of a healthy lifestyle, and they can helpto avoid unnecessary contact with conventional 'western' medicine. While centuries of use in traditional settings can be used as testimony that a parti- cular herbal ingredient is effective or safe, several problems must be addressed as theseingredients are incorporated into modern practice. One problem is that ingredients once used for symptomatic management in tradi- tional healing are now used in developed countries as part of health promotion or diseaseprevention strategies; thus, acute treatment has been replaced by chronic exposure (e.g.,herbal products used for weight loss, Allison et al. , 2001). This means that a statement about 'thousands of years of evidence that a product is safe' may not be valid for the wayIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 44the product is now being used. This does not expressly mean that an ingredient is unsafe; it does mean that safety in the modern context cannot be assumed. A second problem is that efficacy and effectiveness have rarely been demonstrated using modern scientific investigations. An evidence-based approach to this issue hasonly recently been implemented, and the results reveal that for most herbal products,considerable gaps in knowledge need to be remedied before one can be convinced abouttheir efficacy. One of the most difficult issues to contend with in translating traditional herbal practices into conventional 'western' medicine is the individualization of prescriptionscontaining multiple herbal and other ingredients. There is little incentive for standar-dization of products for a mass market, when the intention has been to provide an indivi-dual prescription. To the small grower or the traditionally trained herbalist, standar-dization means understanding the growth conditions, the time of harvesting, the mannerof extraction or other preparation of material so that a reliable (albeit small amount of)active ingredient can be offered to people. To the manufacturer or distributor of largequantities that will be sold in a supermarket or a health food store, standardization refersto industrial production under defined conditions, using so-called Good ManufacturingPractices (GMP) (Food & Drug Administration, 2002) akin to those used for drugproduction. In the USA, there is both small-scale and large-scale production of herbal products and there can be wide variation in their content and quality in the marketplace. Regu-lations in the USA do not yet require that dietary supplement manufacturers adhere tostandard manufacturing practices, and so quality is not guaranteed (see Section 3). Thepublic becomes discouraged by reports that products taken from store shelves do notconsistently contain the ingredients \u2014 or in the amounts \u2014 that are claimed on the label. For herbal products in common use, evidence of efficacy may be based upon tradi- tional use, testimonials, clinical studies, both controlled and uncontrolled, and rando-mized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. For the most part, however, there is a lackof systematic clinical studies to support claims. Safety of some herbal ingredients has been recently called into question, in part because of the identification of adverse events associated with their use and, increasingly,because of the demonstration of clinically relevant interactions between herbs and pres-cription drugs. Adverse events (stroke, heart attacks, heart-rate irregularities, liver toxicity, seizures, psychoses and death) associated with use of ephedra for weight loss, body-buildingeffects and increased energy or kava-kava (also known as kawa), widely used in Europeand increasingly in Canada to treat anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, pain and muscletension, for example, have caused some countries to issue regulations restricting orbanning these products (e.g. Health Canada Online, 2002a,b). Only a few herbs incommon use have been suspected of causing cancer. These discussed in detail below. SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 452. Use of Traditional Herbal Medicines in Developed Countries 2.1 Origin, type and botanical data Plants and their secondary metabolite constituents have a long history of use in modern 'western' medicine and in certain systems of traditional medicine, and are thesources of important drugs such as atropine, codeine, digoxin, morphine, quinine andvincristine. Use of herbal medicines in developed countries has expanded sharply in the latter half of the twentieth century. Monographs on selected herbs are available from a numberof sources, including the European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP,1999), German Commission E (Blumenthal et al. , 1998) and the World Health Organi- zation (WHO, 1999). The WHO monographs, for example, describe the herb itself by anumber of criteria (including synonyms and vernacular names) and the herb partcommonly used, its geographical distribution, tests used to identify and characterize theherb (including macroscopic and microscopic examination and purity testing), the activeprinciples (when known), dosage forms and dosing, medicinal uses, pharmacology,contra-indications and adverse reactions. Other resources that provide detailed infor-mation about herbal products in current use include the Natural Medicines Compre-hensive Database (Jellin, 2002) and NAPRALERT (NAtural PRoducts ALERT) (2001).Information about other available databases has been published by Bhat (1995). 2.2 Medicinal applications, beneficial effects and active components In some cases, the active principles of plant-derived products have been isolated and characterized, and their mechanisms of action are understood (e.g., ephedrine alkaloidsin some species of Ephedra ). For many, however, including virtually all of the most common products in the marketplace, such information is incomplete or unavailable.This is in large part due to the complexity of herbal and botanical preparations; they arenot pure compounds. It is also a function of the traditionally-held belief that the syner-gistic combination of several active principles in some herbal preparations is responsiblefor their beneficial effects. 2.3 Trends in use Data on the global nutrition products industry, in which herbal and botanical products are often included, are given in Table 1. Sales of dietary supplement products, including herbal and botanical supplements, in the USA increased dramatically during the 1990s, stimulated in the latter part of theIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 46SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 47Table 1.

This pattern of growth has been replicated elsewhere in the world (Table 2),although more recently, sales of herbal products have apparently experienced a decline. In the European Union (EU), in general, herbal products for which therapeutic claims are made must be marketed and regulated as drugs, while those that do not make suchclaims may be found in the food or cosmetic categories. Attempts are at present beingmade to harmonize the scientific and regulatory criteria that govern the marketing ofherbal products (AESGP, 1998). In 1994, when the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act (DSHEA) was passed in the USA, approximately 50% of the adult population of the country wasreported to use dietary supplements and sales of all products combined were approxi-mately $4 billion. This category of products includes vitamins, minerals and a variety ofother ingredients; herbal products accounted for about one quarter of those sales. In2000, the last year for which comparable data are available, again 50% of the adultpopulation reported use of dietary supplements, and sales were close to $15 billion;herbals accounted for nearly one third of those sales. Table 3 identifies some trends inherbal supplement use in the USA from 1997 to 2000. In the 1990s, the USA saw the growth of government organizations concerned with dietary supplements, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center forComplementary and Alternative Medicine and Office of Dietary Supplements, and theNational Cancer Institute (NCI) Chemoprevention Program of the Division of CancerPrevention and Control.

In Canada, herbal use has also increased. Berger (2001) noted, in summarizing the results of a 2001 survey of 2500 persons, 15 years of age and older, that herbal remedieswere used by 38% of respondents, up from 28% in 1999. A survey in 1998 of the mostpopular remedies reported in Canada is given in Table 4. In 1994, the European herbal medicine market was worth over \u00a31.8 billion [US$ 2.8 billion] at retail selling prices. Although the UK market was smaller than thatof Germany (in 1994 it was \u00a388 million, compared with \u00a31400 million), it had one of thehighest forecast growth rates in Europe (Shaw, 1998).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 49 Table 3.

Awareness, Control, Regulation and Legislation on Use 3.1 WHO guidelines for herbal medicines In 1992, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific invited a group of experts to develop criteria and general principles to guide research work on evaluating herbalmedicines (WHO, 1993). This group recognized the importance of herbal medicines tothe health of many people throughout the world, stating: 'A few herbal medicines havewithstood scientific testing, but others are used simply for traditional reasons to protect,restore, or improve health. Most herbal medicines still need to be studied scientifically,although the experience obtained from their traditional use over the years should not beignored. As there is not enough evidence produced by common scientific approaches toanswer questions of safety and efficacy about most of the herbal medicines now in use,the rational use and further development of herbal medicines will be supported by furtherappropriate scientific studies of these products, and thus the development of criteria forsuch studies'.

(2001) a From a survey of 6849 adults in April 1998 b See Table 3. c Reported previously as Matricaria chamomilla (WHO, 1999)The document covered such topics as developing protocols for clinical trials using herbal medicines, evaluating herbal medicine research, guidelines for quality specifi-cations of plant materials and preparations, and guidelines for pharmacodynamic andgeneral pharmacological studies of herbal medicines and for toxicity investigations ofherbal medicines. WHO has also issued Guidelines for the Assessment of Herbal Medicines (WHO, 1996). These guidelines defined the basic criteria for the evaluation of quality, safety andefficacy of herbal medicines with the goal of assisting national regulatory authorities,scientific organizations and manufacturers in assessing documentation, submissions anddossiers in respect of such products. It was recommended that such assessments take intoaccount long-term use in the country (over at least several decades), any description inthe medical and pharmaceutical literature or similar sources or documentation ofknowledge on the application of a herbal medicine, and marketing authorizations forsimilar products. Although prolonged and apparently uneventful use of a substanceusually offers testimony of its safety, investigation of the potential toxicity of naturallyoccurring substances may reveal previously unsuspected problems. It was also recom-mended that regulatory authorities have the authority to respond promptly to new infor-mation on toxicity by withdrawing or limiting the licences of registered products contai-ning suspect substances, or by reclassifying the substances to limit their use to medicalprescription. The guidelines stressed the need for assessment of efficacy including thedetermination of pharmacological and clinical effects of the active ingredients, andlabelling which includes a quantitative list of active ingredient(s), dosage, and contra-indications. 3.2 The European Union The Association Europ\u00e9enne des Sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s Pharmaceutiques Grand Public (Asso- ciation of the Self-Medication Industry; AESGP) has carried out a study forthe European Commission on herbal medicinal products in the European Union (EU).The following summary is taken from this report (AESGP, 1998). The importance of herbal medicinal products varies from one country to another. These products are not a homogeneous group. In general, they are either fully licensedmedicinal products with efficacy proven by clinical studies or by references to publishedscientific literature (in accordance with Article 4.8 a (ii) of Council Directive65/65/EEC) (European Commission, 1965) or are available as products with a more orless simplified proof of efficacy according to their national use. Many Member Stateshave these two categories, but there are major discrepancies between the Member Statesin the classification of individual herbal drug preparations and products into one of thesecategories as well as in the requirements for obtaining a marketing authorization.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 513.2.1 Definition of herbal medicinal products According to Council Directive 65/65/EEC (European Commission, 1965), which has been implemented in national law in all Member States, medicinal products requireprior marketing approval before gaining access to the market. In almost all MemberStates, herbal medicinal products are considered as medicinal products, and are, inprinciple, subject to the general regulations for medicines as laid down in the variousnational medicine laws. In many cases, a specific definition of herbal medicinal productsis available, which is in line with the EU Guideline 'Quality of Herbal MedicinalProducts'. This includes plants, parts of plants and their preparations, mostly presentedwith therapeutic or prophylactic claims. Different categories of medicinal productscontaining plant preparations exist or are in the process of being created. For instance,draft legislation in Spain includes the definitions 'herbal medicinal products' and'phytotraditional products'. The latter are not considered as 'pharmaceutical specialties'and are therefore not classified as herbal medicinal products. 3.2.2 Classification of herbal products Generally, herbal products are classified as medicinal products if they claim thera- peutic or prophylactic indication, and are not considered as medicinal products whenthey do not make these claims. Products not classified as medicinal in most cases belongto the food or cosmetic areas, although they sometimes contain plants which havepharmacological properties. For example, senna pods (from Cassia plants, used as laxatives) (see General Remarks and monograph on Rubia tinctorum , Morinda officinalis and anthraquinones in this volume) can be marketed as food in Belgium. Specific cate-gories of non-medicinal products exist in some Member States, such as the so-called'therapeutic supplement products' in Austria. In Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom,there exist preparations defined as medicinal products, which are under specific condi-tions exempt from licensing requirements. 3.2.3 Combination products Herbal ingredients used in combination are widely used in Europe, and their assessment is often performed according to specific guidelines. Combinations of herbaland homeopathic ingredients exist in a few countries. Their assessment follows ratherstrict criteria, usually those of a 'full' application procedure. Combinations of herbalingredients and vitamins are available in many countries. 3.2.4 Documentation of quality, safety and efficacy A marketing authorization for a herbal medicinal product is, in principle, granted based on an extensive dossier in terms of proof of quality, safety and efficacy in allMember States, with the exception of Denmark and Finland, where it is possible to useIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 52only references to published data for herbal medicinal products. Luxembourg, in practice, only grants marketing authorization based on the assessment of other countries.In principle, according to Article 4.8 (a) (ii) of Council Directive 65/65/EEC (EuropeanCommission, 1965), the option of using reviews on published data is available in allMember States. However, this 'bibliographical' option is sometimes only availablethrough assessment on a case-by-case basis or not used in practice. Austria permits thistype of application for safety documentation only. 3.2.5 ESCOP and WHO monographs European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP) (see Awang, 1997) or WHO monographs may be used in many Member States as a summary of published data.Many regulatory authorities regard them as helpful documentation for clarifying efficacyand safety. The European Commission (EC), the EMEA (European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) Executive Director and the EMEA Management Board esta-blished the EMEA Ad Hoc Group in 1997. This Working Group is made up of represen-tatives from the Member States (primarily health authorities) and representatives fromthe European Parliament, the EC and the European Pharmacopoeia. The Working Grouphas reviewed the criteria for the demonstration of quality, pre-clinical safety and clinicalefficacy in marketing authorization applications for herbal medicinal products as set outin the Council Directives. The Working Group has proposed requirements for non-clinical testing of herbal drug preparations based on a draft EC Guideline for oldsubstances with long market histories (EMEA, 2000). The Group has also discussed theappropriate role of scientific monographs prepared by the WHO and ESCOP. 3.2.6 Simplified proof of efficacy Various traditional herbal medicinal products exist in many Member States in addi- tion to fully licensed herbal medicinal products. For these products, national authoritiesusually verify the safety and ensure a sufficient level of quality. For proof of efficacy, thelevel of requirements is sometimes adjusted to take into account the long-term expe-rience and is therefore simplified. For example, a specific simplified procedure exists inAustria, Belgium, France and Germany. Most other countries in the EU do not use thisstrategy. 3.2.7 Further developed products For herbal medicinal products that have been proposed for non-traditional indi- cations or are modified from their traditional form (e.g., highly processed or specialextracts), a full licence is required in most cases, and efficacy has to be proven by clinicalstudies. In several countries, such products are not used.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 533.2.8 Individual supply Herbal medicinal products (like other medicinal products) are made up and/or supplied to individual patients following a one-to-one consultation between patient andpractitioner. Some herbal medicinal products are made according to accepted formulaeand are prepared by pharmacists. According to Article 2.4 of Council Directive65/65/EEC (European Commission, 1965), a marketing authorization is not needed. Aspecific situation exists in the United Kingdom, where a practitioner, according toSection 12 of the Medicines Act 1968 (Griffin, 1998), may supply products to a customerwithout a licence. 3.2.9 Products from foreign countries The quality of imported medicinal plants and their preparations is assessed diffe- rently in different Member States. In some cases, no specific regulations exist concerningthe control of raw materials or crude drugs, particularly for products that enter the marketas foodstuffs or other products that are not controlled in the same way as medicinalproducts. Finished products are often treated as new chemical entities with full proof ofquality, safety and efficacy being required. 3.2.10 Good manufacturing practices and quality control All Member States apply the manufacturing requirements of Council Directive 75/319/EEC (European Commission, 1975) to herbal medicinal products. Startingmaterials for herbal medicinal products are in principle controlled in accordance with theEuropean Pharmacopoeia in all Member States. Good manufacturing practice inspectionsare carried out in nearly all Member States. The European Pharmacopoeia was created in 1964; its efforts have resulted in the creation of 83 monographs on herbal drugs which are used either in their natural stateafter desiccation or concentration or for the isolation of natural active ingredients(Council of Europe, 1996). 3.2.11 Post-marketing surveillance The adverse reaction reporting systems of the Member States also monitor herbal medicinal products if they are authorized medicinal products. This system has demons-trated its effectiveness in the case of several withdrawals of marketing authorizations forherbal medicinal products due to safety concern in connection with certain plants.Consumer reports could provide a picture of the spectrum of adverse reactions to herbalmedicinal products and alert authorities to potential problems; the degree of acceptanceof such reports varies between Member States. IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 543.2.12 Advertising, distribution and retail sale All Member States have implemented Council Directive 92/28/EEC (European Commission, 1992a) on advertising in national law. This directive covers herbal productsif they are authorized as medicinal products. Wholesale marketing of all medicinal products as well as authorized herbal medi- cinal products is covered by Council Directive 92/25/EEC (European Commission,1992b). The retail sale of herbal medicinal products is restricted to pharmacies inBelgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. It is permittedin other outlets in the case of certain herbal medicinal products in Austria, Denmark,Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Distance sellingand teleshopping are not permitted for herbal medicinal products in most countries. 3.2.13 Differences between Member States Herbal medicinal products are regarded as medicinal products in most of the Member States and have, in theory, the option of obtaining marketing authorization inthe same way as all other medicinal products. However, the legal systems of the MemberStates differ in the classification of herbal products, in the availability of an applicationprocess for a marketing authorization based on a full application, bibliographicalapplication or simplified proof of efficacy, and in the permitted outlets for retaildistribution. Member States have different traditions regarding the therapeutic use ofmedicinal plant preparations, which may make it more difficult for manufacturers ofherbal medicinal products to apply for marketing authorization using the decentralizedprocedure. 3.3 Individual countries (Calixto, 2000) 3.3.1 France The French Medicines Agency (Agence du M\u00e9dicament) grants marketing autho- rizations based on abridged dossiers by making reference to traditional use. Theshortened procedure requires limited or no pharmacological, toxicological and clinicaltests and is detailed in the Agency Instructions No. 3. The list of drugs with acceptedtraditional uses was first published in 1985 by the Ministry of Health and has sub-sequently been revised several times (Table 5). Traditional use of approximately 200herbal drugs or preparations derived from these drugs has been recognized for minorindications. Agency Instructions No. 3 includes rules for labelling and packaging ofherbal medicinal products. If the drug is not specifically included in the list, there is nooption to use an abridged procedure (AESGP, 1998). As of 1997, local medicinal plantswere on the A list of the French Pharmacopoeia (Castot et al. , 1997) which groups the 454 herbs which benefit/risk ratio is considered as positive when traditionally used.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 55IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 56 Table 5.

(1997) have reviewed the surveillance or pharmacovigilance of herbal medicines in France. Between 1 and 15 October 1996, the authors observed 15 publi-cations or publicities in 23 magazines widely available in France; these publications/publicities offered for sale by mail a number of medicinal plants found or not found onthe list of 34 'approved' plants. (These plants were listed in 1979 by the government inreason of lack of reported toxicity in traditional use or following complete bibliographicinvestigation.) Between 1985 and 1995, the French national surveillance system registered 341 cases of undesirable effects possibly linked to herbal medicines; this figure representsonly 0.35% of the total adverse effects from all drugs reported during the same period.The number of adverse effects from herbal medicines is almost certainly under-reported.The population concerned was largely female (73%) with a mean age of 50 years;reasons for taking herbal medicines were constipation, obesity and anxiety. Undesirableeffects reported were quite diverse, including allergic and cutaneous responses, eczema,liver damage tonic, diuretic)), digestive problems (linked to laxative plants), neurological effects such as vertigo (linked to plantsclassified as sedatives) and blood pressure fall and hypokalaemia (linked to plant laxa-tives containing anthraquinones (see monograph in this volume)). Outcome of thesecases was generally favourable (Castot et al., 1997).SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 57 Table 5 (contd) Medicinal plantInformation for the medical profession Information for the public Plantago major L.Traditionally used topically as a soothing and antipruriginous application for dermatological ailments and as a protective treatment forcracks, grazes, chapped skin and insect bites.Traditionally used topically as a soothing application and to calm the itching of skin ailments and in cases of cracks, grazes,chapped skin and insect bites (Precaution: do not use before exposure to the sun).

From AESGP (1998) a See General Remarks3.3.2 Germany (see Kraft, 1999; Calixto, 2000) Keller (1991) summarized the legal requirements for the use of phytopharmaceutical drugs in the Federal Republic of Germany. The legal status for herbal remedies wasdefined by the Medicines Act of 24 August 1976. For finished drugs a marketingauthorization is obligatory. Herbal finished drugs have to comply with the same criteriafor quality, safety and efficacy as all other finished drugs. Finished herbal drugs may beauthorized for marketing in one of three ways: (i) Evaluation and validation of old medicines . Finished drugs registered in 1978 possessed a provisional marketing authorization and could remain on themarket until the end of April 1990. The medical evaluation of these drugs wasmainly based on published data and was carried out by a special expertcommittee, the Commission E (Expert Commission for Herbal Remedies). Thepreparation of new monographs by Commission E ended in 1993 (Sandberg &Corrigan, 2001). (ii) Standardized marketing authorization . Medicines that do not represent a direct or indirect risk for health can be exempted from the need for an individualmarketing authorization by reference to a previously existing monograph. (iii) Individual application for marketing authorization . In this procedure, complete documentation including the results of analytical tests, results ofpharmacological and toxicological tests and results of clinical or other medicaltests are required. In addition, drugs sold outside pharmacies and only for traditional uses without clinical evidence for efficacy have to be labelled as 'traditionally used' (Table 6). 3.3.3 United Kingdom A number of papers have discussed the situation regarding herbal medicines in the United Kingdom. De Smet (1995) recommended that herbal products be licensed asspecial products 'medicines'; he estimated that unlicensed preparations accounted forover 80% of herbal sales. Many medicine-like products on the British herbal marketremain unregistered for two reasons: acceptable data on efficacy, safety and quality maynot be available, and the licensing fee is high. Traditional experience with herbs can bea useful tool in detecting acute toxicity, but is less useful in detecting rare adversereactions or those that develop after long-term exposure or after a latent period.Therefore, traditional experience needs to be supplemented with orthodox data fromresearch and post-marketing surveillance. Such post-marketing surveillance is onlypartly helpful, as herbal suppliers and traditional practitioners are not obliged to reportsuspected adverse reactions and herbal products are of variable quality.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 58Shaw (1998) has discussed the safety aspects of herbal remedies in the United Kingdom. The legal status of herbal remedies/medicines in the United Kingdom can bebroadly divided into three categories: (i) Most herbal products are unlicensed and therefore no medicinal claims can be made. These are regarded as food supplements and come under foodlegislation (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), 1998). (ii) Licensed medicinal products require evidence of quality, safety and efficacy and are regulated by the Medicines Control Agency. (iii) Herbal medicines supplied by a herbalist are exempt from licensing under the 1968 Medicines Act. Since 1996, the Medicines Control Agency has included adverse reaction reports on unlicensed herbal remedies within its remit and now monitors all three categories(Griffin, 1998). The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee in early 1999 reviewed a large amount of oral and written evidence from a wide variety of sources in order to scru-tinize complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) including herbal medicines(Mills, 2001). The report noted that public satisfaction with CAM was high and that useof CAM was increasing. Evidence was required that CAM has an effect above andSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 59 Table 6.

The current lack of regulation of CAM did not protect the public interest adequately. Acupunctureand herbal medicine should be subject to statutory regulation under the Health Act 1999,as should possibly non-medical homeopathy. The regulatory status of herbal medicineswas viewed as particularly unsatisfactory. The report recommended that training forCAM professionals should be standardized and independently accredited and, for many,should include basic biomedical science. Conventional health professionals shouldbecome more familiar with CAM and those working in the best-regulated CAM pro-fessions should work towards integration with conventional medicine. 3.3.4 United States In the USA, the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act characterizes a product primarily on the basis of its intended use. For a botanical product, this intended use may be as afood (including a dietary supplement), a drug (including a biological drug), a medicaldevice (e.g., gutta-percha) or a cosmetic as shown by, among other things, the products'accompanying labelling claims, advertising materials, and oral or written statements(21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 201.128) (Food and Drug Administration (FDA),2000). For products classified as drugs, the FDA regulates them under the authority of the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act and its amendments. Under current regulations, if there isno marketing history in the USA for a botanical drug product, if available evidence ofsafety and effectiveness does not warrant inclusion of the product in an existing,approved category of OTC (over-the-counter) drugs, or if the proposed indication wouldnot be appropriate for non-prescription use, the manufacturer must submit a new drugapplication to obtain FDA approval to market the product for the proposed use. Ifexisting information on the safety and efficacy of a botanical drug product is insufficientto support a new drug application, new clinical studies will be needed to demonstratesafety and effectiveness. Most botanical products in the USA are marketed as dietary supplements. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), an orally ingestedproduct that meets the definition of a 'dietary supplement' under section 201(ff) of theFood Drug and Cosmetics Act may be lawfully marketed using a statement that(1) claims a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease (and discloses theprevalence of the disease in the USA); (2) describes how the product is intended to affectthe structure or function of the human body; (3) characterizes the documented mecha-nism by which the product acts to maintain such structure or function; or (4) describesgeneral well-being derived from consumption of the product (section 403 r (6)(A) of theFood Drug and Cosmetics Act, 21 U.S.C. 343 r(6)(A)). The term 'dietary supplement' isdefined in section 201 (ff) of the Act and means a product (other than tobacco) intendedto supplement the diet that contains one or more of certain dietary ingredients, such as avitamin, a mineral, a herb or another botanical substance, an amino acid, a dietaryIARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 60substance for use by people to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding ingre-dients (Chang, 1999). A dietary supplement is a product that is intended for ingestion ina form described in section 411C(1)(B)(i) of the Act (i.e., tablet, capsule powder, softgel,gelcap and liquid), which is not represented as conventional food, or as the sole item ofa meal or of the diet, and which is labelled as a dietary supplement. It is the responsibilityof the manufacturer to ensure that a dietary ingredient used in a dietary supplement issafe for its intended use. The FDA has issued regulations defining the types of statement that can be made concerning the effect of a dietary supplement on the structure and function of the body.The regulations distinguish these statements from the types of statement that requireprior approval as drug claims or prior authorization as health claims. Safety monitoring of dietary supplements focuses on the post-marketing period. The FDA receives spontaneous reports of suspected adverse events through a variety ofmeans, including through a programme called MEDWATCH, the FDA Medical ProductsReporting Program (Goldman & Kennedy, 1998). The post-marketing surveillancesystem for foods and dietary supplements, called the Adverse Event Reporting Systems,is a passive system that relies on voluntary reporting by concerned parties, primarilyhealth professionals and consumers (AESGP, 1998). The DSHEA extended the definition of dietary supplements beyond vitamins and minerals and established a formal definition of a dietary supplement using new criteria.The Congressionally mandated Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels (CDSL)suggested that some botanicals may qualify as OTC products under existing statutes;these state that a product may avoid 'new drug' premarket approval requirements andmay be eligible for marketing under an OTC drug monograph if the product is generallyrecognized as safe (GRAS) and effective under the conditions for use for which it islabelled and if the product has been used 'to a material extent and for a material time'under those conditions. The FDA's response to the Commission stated that it does notregard marketing experience outside the USA to meet conditions of historical use. Angell and Kassirer (1998) stated that the primary factor that sets alternative medicine, including its most common form, herbal medicine, apart from conventionalmedicine is 'that it has not been scientifically tested and its advocates largely deny theneed for such testing'. Angell and Kassirer defined 'testing' as the gathering of evidenceof safety and efficacy, as required by the FDA. 'There cannot be two kinds of medicine\u2014 conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately testedand medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work.Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was consi-dered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will beaccepted. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorousthan that required for conventional treatments'.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 613.3.5 Canada The Canadian Food and Drug Act and findings of an Expert Advisory Committee on Herbs and Botanical Preparations were consulted by Kozyrskyj (1997) to provide anoverview of the issues regarding regulation of herbal products in Canada. Case reports ofherbal toxicity were identified to illustrate some of the hazards of herbal products, andreferences were provided to guide health professionals in searching the literature forclinical trials that have evaluated the efficacy of these drugs. Herbal products not registered as drugs in Canada are sold as foods and are thus exempt from the drug review process that evaluates product efficacy and safety. AnExpert Advisory Committee on Herbs and Botanical Preparations was formed in 1984 toadvise the Health Protection Branch (HPB). HPB published lists of hazardous herbalproducts in 1987, 1989, 1992 and 1993. The last publication elicited a large responsefrom consumers and the herbal industry. As of 1995, the list was still under review(Kozyrskyj, 1997). The recently formed Office of Natural Health Products (currently the Natural Health Products Directorate) (Sibbald, 1999) is responsible for all regulatory functions inclu-ding, but not limited to pre-market assessment for product labelling, licensing of manu-facturers, post-approval monitoring and compliance and implementation of the recom-mendations of the standing House Health Committee. In December 2000, the provincial government of British Columbia approved regu- lations that established traditional Chinese medicine as an alternative form of primaryhealth care. The cost is not covered under Canadian medicare and practitioners faceseveral practice restrictions. For example, 'no acupuncturist or herbalist may treat anactive serious medical condition unless the client has consulted with a medical practi-tioner, naturopath or dentist or doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, as appropriate'(Johnson, 2001). 3.3.6 Chile In 1992 the Unidad de Medicina Tradicional was established with the aims of incor- porating traditional medicine with proven efficacy into health programmes and of contri-buting to the establishment of their practice. Herbal medicines are legally differentiatedinto: (a) drugs intended to cure, alleviate or prevent diseases; (b) food products for medi-cinal use and with therapeutic properties; and (c) food products for nutritional purposes(Calixto, 2000). Herbal products with therapeutic indications and/or dosage recommendations are considered to be drugs. Distribution of these products is restricted to pharmacies. A regis-tration for marketing authorization is needed for herbal products, homeopathic products,and other natural products. An application for such registration consists of the completeformula, the labelling, samples of the product, and a monograph which permits iden-tification of the formula and characteristics of the product (Zhang, 1998).IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 623.3.7 Japan (Zhang, 1998; Eguchi et al. , 2000; Saito, 2000) Japanese traditional medicine, as used in Japanese society for more than a thousand years, may be divided into folk medicine and Chinese medicine (or Kampo medicine).Kampo medicine is so popular that the per capita consumption of herbal medicine inJapan seems to be the highest in the world. One hundred and forty-six Kampo drugs areregistered as drugs by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) and are included incoverage under the National Health Insurance. Acceptance of Kampo drugs took placewithout clinical validation studies. In 1989, about 80% of physicians reported pres-cribing Chinese medicine. Physicians generally recognize Chinese medicine as a com-plement to modern medicine; traditional drugs are viewed in Japanese society as safe. Raw herbs which have long been used as folk medicine and which have also been used for a considerable period as components of an industrial product are each describedin a corresponding monograph. These products are freely usable for the purposes indi-cated in the monograph. Local traditional usage is not sufficient for approval as a drug;the claims and rules of combinations of herbal ingredients are determined on the basis ofthe pharmacological actions of the ingredients. If a monograph is not available, theclaims reported in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia are used as a guide. In the evaluation of a Chinese medicine, importance is given to 'empirical facts or experience', such as reference data, clinical test reports, etc., rather than the pharmaco-logical action of each ingredient. Safety and efficacy have been estimated based ongeneral methods employed by modern medical science. In 1972 the MHW designated210 formulae as OTC drugs; this selection was based primarily on the experience ofdoctors actually practising traditional Chinese medicine. In 1976, the MHW specified146 formulations as 'National Health Insurance (NHI) applicable prescription drugs'. Inthe case of an application for approval of a prescription drug other than those previouslylisted, specified data on safety, stability, comparison with other drugs, clinical testresults, etc. must be submitted. New Kampo drugs are regulated in essentially the same way as 'western' drugs in Japan. The same data required for new 'western' drugs are required for new Kampodrugs, including data from three-phase clinical trials. Since 1971, the MHW has been running a programme for re-evaluation of all drugs marketed before 1967; a new system to re-evaluate the efficacy and safety for all drugsevery five years was launched in 1988. An Advisory Committee for Kampo drugs was established in 1982 in close asso- ciation with the MHW in order to improve quality control of Kampo drugs. Since the1986 Good Manufacturing Practice Law, the standard applied to all pharmaceuticaldrugs has also applied to Kampo drugs. In addition, in 1985, guidelines for ethicalextract products in oriental medicine formulations were developed. The MHW has three major systems for collection of adverse reaction data. The first is a voluntary system involving 2915 monitoring hospitals. The second system \u2014 thePharmacy Monitoring System \u2014 which includes 2733 pharmacies, collects data on casesSOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 63of adverse reactions to OTC drugs. The third system is Adverse Reaction Reporting from Manufacturers. These cases are reported to the MHW by the responsible company, withinformation arising from medical conferences and from journals. 3.3.8 Korea (Republic of) The Pharmaceutical Act of 1993 explicitly allowed pharmacists to prescribe and dispense herbal drugs (Cho, 2000). 3.3.9 China Many herbal medicines have been used for hundreds of years and it is assumed in many cases that they must work. For example, about 7000 species of plants are used inChina as herbal medicines, but only 230 of the most commonly used ones have beensubject to in-depth pharmacological, analytical and clinical studies. The 2000 edition of the Chinese pharmacopoeia included 784 items on traditional Chinese medicines and 509 on Chinese patent medicines. Herbal medicines in China arenormally considered as medicinal products with special requirements for marketing.New drugs have to be investigated and approved according to the Drug AdministrationLaw. New traditional Chinese medicines are classified under five categories based on theAmendment and Supplement Regulation of Approval of new traditional medicines: Class 1 (1) Artificial alternatives of Chinese crude drugs.(2) Newly discovered Chinese crude drugs and their preparations.(3) Active constituents extracted from Chinese crude drugs and their preparations.(4) Active constituents extracted from a composite formulation of traditional Chinese medicines. Class 2 (1) Injection of traditional Chinese medicines(2) Use of new medicinal parts of Chinese crude drugs and their preparations.(3) Effective fractions extracted from Chinese crude drugs or natural drugs and their preparations. (4) Chinese crude drugs artificially developed in an animal body and their preparations. (5) Effective fractions extracted from a composite formulation. Class 3 (1) New composite formulations of traditional Chinese medicines.(2) Composite preparations of traditional Chinese medicines and chemical drugs with the main efficacy due to the traditional Chinese medicine. (3) Domestically cultivated or bred crude drugs originally imported and commonly used in China, and their preparations.IARC MONOGRAPHS VOLUME 82 64Class 4 (1) Preparation with a change of dosage form or route of administration. (2) Botanical crude drugs acclimatized from their origin, or crude drugs from a domesticated wild animal in China. Class 5 Marketing drugs with new indications or syndromes. In Hong Kong in 1989, the Government appointed a Working Party to review and make recommendations for the use and practice of traditional Chinese medicines. In1995 the preparatory Committee on Chinese medicines was formed to manage the imple-mentation of these recommendations: as a result 31 potent Chinese medicines that maypotentially cause adverse effects have been identified. Proprietary preparations con-taining a combination of herbal ingredients and conventional drugs are regulated in thesame manner as other conventional drugs. The majority of suppliers are state-owned or state-connected. The extensive pharma- copoeia relating to traditional Chinese medicine allows the parallel manufacturing andsale of both pharmaceutical drugs and traditional herbal blends (Chan, 1997; Zhang,1998). 3.3.10 Saudi Arabia Registration of medicinal products by the Ministry of Health is obligatory, as is that of products, in addition to drugs, with medicinal claims or containing active ingredientshaving medicinal effects such as herbal preparations, health and supplementary food,medicated cosmetics, antiseptics or medical devices (Zhang, 1998). 3.3.11 South Africa (Zhang, 1998) The trade in crude indigenous herbal products is completely unregulated. A large number of South Africans consult traditional healers, generally in addition to medicalpractitioners. There are about 200 000 traditional healers in the country. Once a health-related claim is made for a finished herbal product, that product must go through a full drug evaluation in the Medicines Control Council (MCC) beforemarketing. Specific regulations for registration and control of new 'traditional' herbal medicines do not exist. Old medicines, including such well known herbal medicines as senna oraloe, are already registered by the MCC, according to internationally accepted standardsof efficacy and safety. Pharmaceutical standards need to be consistent with those of theUnited States Pharmacopeia or the British Pharmacopoeia.SOME TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINES 653.3.12 Australia and New Zealand (Moulds & McNeil, 1988; Zhang, 1998) The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 sets out the legal requirements for the import, export, manufacture and supply of medicines in Australia. It details the requirements forlisting or registering all therapeutic goods in the Australian Register of TherapeuticGoods (ARTG), as well as many other aspects of the law including advertising, labellingand product appearance. Australian manufacturers of therapeutic goods must be licensedand their manufacturing processes must comply with the principles of Good Manufac-turing Practice (GMP). All medicines manufactured for supply in Australia must be listedor registered in the ARTG, unless they are specifically exempt or excluded. Listed medi-cines are considered to be of lower risk than registered medicines. Most complementarymedicines (e.g., herbal, vitamin and mineral products) are examples of listed products.Medicines assessed as having a higher level of risk must be registered (not listed).Registered medicines include non-prescription (low-risk, OTC) medicines and prescrip-tion (high-risk) medicines. Complementary medicines (also known as 'traditional' or'alternative' medicines) include vitamin, mineral, herbal, aromatherapy and homeopathicproducts. Complementary medicines may be either listed or registered, depending ontheir ingredients and the claims made. Most complementary medicines are listed in theARTG and some are registered (Therapeutics Good Administration, 1999). In New Zealand, supplements in the market place are largely manufactured in the USA. Regulations are not restrictive; there are no limits on ingredients or potencies and'structure/function' claims are allowed. 4.
