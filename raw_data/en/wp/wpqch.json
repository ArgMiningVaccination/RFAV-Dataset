Foreignsubstances that provoke allergies are called allergens. It has been claimed that multiplex allergen testing may help in diagnosing the cause of symptoms in patients with an unclear cause of allergy or who are allergic to more than one substance. Objectives: To evaluate multiplex allergen testing [devices that can measure the presence of multiple immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in a patient 's blood at the same time], by assessing (1) clinical effectiveness (allergy symptoms, incidence of acute exacerbations, mortality, adverse events of testing and treatment, health-care presentations or admissions, health-related quality of life); (2) effects on treatment (diet, immunotherapy medications, other potential testing); (3) any additional diagnostic informationprovided by multiplex allergen testing; and (4) cost-effectiveness (cost of different assessment strategies). Methods: Fifteen databases were searched from 2005 to April 2015, including MEDLINE (via OvidSp), MEDLINE In-Process Citations, MEDLINE Daily Update, PubMed (National Library of Medicine), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials(CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, Science Citation Index (SCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S), BIOSIS Previews, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), National Institute for HealthResearch (NIHR) HTA programme, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); supplementary searches of conference proceedings and trials registries were performed. Review methods followed published guidance from the Cochrane Collaboration and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination,University of York, UK. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using appropriatepublished tools or a review-specific tool designed by the project team. Studies were summarised in a narrative synthesis. Owing to a lack of data on the clinical effectiveness of multiplex allergen testing, no long-term cost-effectiveness model was developed. A conceptual model structure was developed and costanalyses were performed to examine the short-term costs of various possible diagnostic pathways.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

The very limited available data indicated that the addition of multiplex allergen testing [ImmunoCAP\u00aeImmuno Uppsala, Sweden] to standard diagnostic work-up can change the clinicians ' views on the diagnosis, management and treatment of patients. There was some indication that the use of ImmunoCAP ISAC testing may be useful to guide decisions on the discontinuation of restrictive diets, the content of allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) prescriptions, and whether or not patients shouldreceive SIT. However, none of the studies that we identified reported any information on clinical outcomessubsequent to changes in treatment or management. There was some evidence that ImmunoCAP ISAC may be useful for discriminating allergens that are structurally similar and are recognised by the same IgE antibody (cross-immunoreactive). No data were available for Microtest (Microtest Matrices Ltd, London, UK).Detailed cost analyses suggested that multiplex allergen testing would have to result in a substantial reduction of the proportions of patients receiving single IgE testing and oral food challenge tests in order to be cost-saving in the short term. Conclusions: No recommendations for service provision can be made based on the analyses included in this report. It is suggested that a consensus-based protocol for the use of multiplex allergen testing be developed. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the proposed protocol should then be assessed by comparing long-term clinical and quality of life outcomes and resource use in patientsmanaged using the protocol with those managed using a standard diagnostic pathway.

Substances that provoke allergies are called allergens (e.g. pollens, house dust mite, fungal spores, insect sting, animal hair, foods and chemicals found at home and work). Most allergic reactions happen when chemicals in the body called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies bind to an allergen and are then taken up by specialist cells in the immune system. The body responds bytriggering allergy symptoms (e.g. rash or skin irritation, wheezing, watering eyes, nose irritation or stomach upset). In extreme cases, a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can result in difficulties in breathing and circulation, and can even cause death. This project aimed to evaluate devices that can measure levels of many different IgE antibodies in a patient 's blood at the same time (multiplex allergen testing). It has been claimed that these devices may help in diagnosing the cause of symptoms in patients with an unclear cause of allergy or who are allergicto more than one substance. We found a small number of studies which indicated that multiplex allergen testing can change the clinicians 'views on the cause of allergy symptoms and treatment options. However, none of the studies reported information on what happened to patients 'allergy symptoms after changes to treatment. Therefore, we do not yet know how using multiplex allergen testing might affect people 's experience of allergic disease.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Multiplex allergen testing is likely to be used in secondary care settings or specialist tertiary care centres, asan addition to allergen challenge testing and in addition to, or in place of, single immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody testing. Multiplex tests may be useful for investigating people with difficult to manage allergic disease: people who are allergic to two or more allergens and/or have allergies to unknown sources. In theUK it is estimated that 10 million patients have two or more allergies. Objectives The overall aim of this project was to summarise the evidence available to inform estimates of the clinicaleffectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people withdifficult to manage allergic disease, in secondary or tertiary UK care settings. We defined the following research objectives to address this aim: 1. To assess the effects on clinical outcomes (e.g. allergy symptoms, incidence of acute exacerbations) of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people with difficult to manage allergic disease. 2. To assess the effects on treatment (e.g. restriction diets, immunotherapy, number of allergen challenge tests required) of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people with difficult tomanage allergic disease. 3. To assess the accuracy of multiplex allergen testing in predicting clinical reactivity and to investigate whether or not multiplex allergen testing can provide diagnostic information additional to that provided by current standard care in the UK [clinical history, skin prick tests (SPTs), single IgE testing]. 4. To assess the cost-effectiveness of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people difficult to manage allergic disease in secondary or tertiary care settings. Methods Assessment of clinical effectiveness Fifteen databases, including MEDLINE (via OvidSp), ME DLINE In-Process Citations, MEDLINE Daily Update, PubMed (National Library of Medicine), EMBASE, Cochra ne Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), HealthTechnology Assessment (HTA) database, Science Cita tion Index (SCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S), BIOSIS Previews, Latin Americ an and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) HTA progr amme, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), were searched from 2005 to April 2015 for terms relating to ImmunoCAP \u00ae, Microtest (Microtest Matrices Ltd, London, UK) or allergy microarray tests. Additional searching was performed for grey literature, three trialregistries and seven conference proceedings. Risk of bia s was assessed using QUADAS-2, The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) cohort risk-of-bias tool, or a review-specific tool designed by the authors, asappropriate. Search results were screened for relevance independently by two reviewers. Studies were includedif they were of adults or children with allergy who received a multiplex allergen test Sweden, or Microtest] in comparison with standard pathways of care. Full text inclusion assessment, data extraction and qualityassessment were conducted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Results were summarised narratively.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science EconLit, IDEAS via Research Papers in Economics and NHS Economic Evaluation Database were searched for full cost-effectiveness analysis ofmultiplex allergen testing from 2005 to May 2015. Included studies are appraised using a quality checklist based on Methods Economic Evaluation Of Health Care Programmes. 3rd edn. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2005). Owing to a lack of data on the clinical effectiveness of multiplex allergen testing, no long-term cost-effectiveness model was developed. A conceptual model structure was developed, literature on utility scores was reviewed, and cost analyses were performed to examine the short-term costs of variouspossible diagnostic pathways. Results Clinical effectiveness A total of 8619 records were identified from searching and screened for inclusion. Fifteen studies wereincluded in the review. No studies were identified of people with difficult to manage allergic disease in the UK. All studies evaluated versions of ImmunoCAP ISAC: none was identified for Microtest. ImmunoCAP ISAC 112 is the most recent version of the ImmunoCAP ISAC array (the number refers to the numberof tests per array). None of the included studies was classified as having a low risk of bias. No studies were identified which investigated clinical outcomes.Two studies ( n=97) investigated the use of ImmunoCAP ISAC to guide decisions on the discontinuation of restrictive diets in children with food allergies. Both studies reported that the results from ImmunoCAP ISAC were used to reintroduce foods, but details were unclear. Two studies ( n=373) assessed clinicians 'views on whether or not ImmunoCAP ISAC provided information useful in the management of patients. Clinicians judged that ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 provided new information useful in the management of the patient in 91- 95% of cases. Added value was defined as the ability to discriminate allergens that were cross-immunoreactive rather than those that were responsible forsensitisation, or the ability to impact upon accuracy of diagnosis or allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT)prescription that was not possible using standard diagnostic work-up. Two studies ( n=459) investigated the effect on SIT prescriptions of adding ImmunoCAP ISAC testing to the standard diagnostic work-up of people with respiratory allergy. Clinicians judged that for 27 -54% of patients changes were made to SIT prescriptions after ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 or ImmunoCAP ISAC 96 testing. Two studies ( n=428) investigated the effect on diagnostic classification of adding ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 testing to the standard diagnostic work-up of people with allergic disease. In one study of idiopathic anaphylaxis, the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 led to the identification of new sensitisations withstrong associations with anaphylaxis in 20% of participants, and in 32% additional sensitisations were identified which were not associated with anaphylaxis. A second study found that the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 testing resulted in increases in the numbers of people classified as 'polysensitised with suspected cross-reactivity 'and the number of people diagnosed with both inhalant and food allergies, as well as facilitating a diagnosis for eight previously unclassifiable patients. One study ( n=9) assessed the relationship between change in IgE levels (measured by ImmunoCAP) before and after a 3-year course of SIT, and the clinicians 'evaluation of the benefit of SIT. The median specific IgE levels decreased and this change correlated with clinical benefit of SIT. Single tests for specific IgE measurements did not show a decrease.SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukxxiiEight studies investigated diagnostic accuracy; none was conducted in people with difficult to manage allergic disease. ImmunoCAP ISAC 112 was not investigated; however, ImmunoCAP ISAC 103, 89, 50 out of 51 were investigated. The diagnostic performance of ImmunoCAP ISAC in comparison with either singleIgE or SPT varied considerably between studies, according to the allergens investigated and the way in which ISAC testing was applied. In general, individual components of ImmunoCAP ISAC tended to have high specificity, but low sensitivity, relative to whole-allergen single IgE tests or SPTs for the prediction ofallergic response. The studies did not provide any information on the specificity of the whole ImmunoCAPISAC panel. Assessment of cost-effectiveness Four economic analyses and 14 health-related quality of life studies were included in the literature review. The systematic review component of this assessment found no data on the clinical consequences of adding multiplex allergen testing to current clinical practice; therefore, a long-term economic model to informhealth policy decision-making was not possible. Therefore, the assessment aimed to inform research decisions and support future model-based economic evaluations. All cost-effectiveness studies showed an increased effectiveness when using ImmunoCAP ISAC and the majority showed cost savings when using ImmunoCAP ISAC. The methods and assumptions used were largely unclear and the credibility of the assessments was questionable; therefore, these findings should be interpreted with extreme caution. The evidence on utility values for allergic conditions in the UK population was limited. Test costs for ImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest were estimated to be \u00a3219.51 and \u00a3156.85, respectively. For SPT, single IgE and the food challenge test these were \u00a362.29, \u00a3136.37 and \u00a3570.00, respectively. A speculative analysis indicated that multiplex allergen testing would have to result in a substantialreduction of the proportions of patients receiving single IgE testing and food challenge tests in order to be cost-saving in the short term. Analyses to compare the effect of replacing single IgE with multiplex testing were difficult to perform because of lack of information regarding where the multiplex test would sit in thecare pathway. Conclusions No recommendations for service provision can be made based on the analyses included in this report. Theclinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using multiplex allergen testing in the investigation of peoplewith difficult to manage allergic disease have yet to be adequately investigated. It is suggested that a consensus-based protocol for the use of multiplex allergen testing be developed. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the proposed protocol should then be assessed by comparing long-term clinicaland quality of life outcomes and resource use in patients managed using the protocol with those managed using a standard diagnostic pathway.

Multiplex allergen testing may replace some single immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing, but, where the multiplex testing panel does notinclude all of the suspected allergens, additional single specific IgE (sIgE) tests may be needed. We defined the following research objectives to address this aim: lTo assess the effects on clinical outcomes [e.g. allergy symptoms, incidence of acute exacerbations, mortality, adverse events (AEs) of testing and treatment, health-care presentations or admissions,health-related quality of life (HRQoL)] of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people with difficult to manage allergic disease. lTo assess the effects on treatment (e.g. restriction diets, immunotherapy, use of other medications such as corticosteroids, number of allergen challenge tests required) of adding multiplex allergen testing tothe investigation of people with difficult to manage allergic disease. lTo assess the accuracy of multiplex allergen testing in predicting clinical reactivity (response to allergenchallenge testing or response to immunotherapy) and to investigate whether or not multiplex allergentesting can provide diagnostic information additional to that provided by current standard care in the UK (clinical history, skin prick tests) and single IgE testing or a combination of these approaches). lTo assess the cost-effectiveness of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people with difficult to manage allergic disease in secondary or tertiary care settings. lThis report contains reference to confidential information provided as part of the National Institute forHealth and Care Excellence (NICE) appraisal process.

Multiplex allergen testing is likely to be used in secondary care settings or specialist tertiary care centres, as an addition to allergen challenge testing and in addition to, or in place of, some sIgE antibody testing.Multiplex allergen testing may replace some IgE testing, but where the multiplex testing panel does not include all of the suspected allergens, additional sIgE tests may be needed. Allergy is a term used to describe immune-mediated hypersensitivity to external stimuli (allergens). Immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions are divided into two categories: IgE-mediated reactions and non-IgE-mediated reactions. IgE antibodies are normally present in very small amounts in the body, butlevels are raised in allergic disease. IgE-mediated immune reactions, also called type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, are typically rapid in onset and can involve extreme acute symptoms as in anaphylaxis or prolonged symptoms (e.g. urticaria or eczema). In an IgE-mediated reaction IgE binds to allergen molecules,which are then taken up by receptors on the surface cells of the immune system, causing the release of biologically active agents and consequent response: vasodilation (widening of increased capillary smooth muscle contraction; and tissue inflammation. Non-IgE-mediated reactions are less well understood and are mediated by other components of the immune system. They are typically delayed in onset, and occur 4 -28 hours after exposure. This assessment will focus on IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Sensitisation describes the process at the start of the immune response. Exposure to an allergen [e.g. house dust mite (HDM) or pollen] initiates a complex set of cellular events within the human body, leading to the production of a specific IgE antibody to a specific allergen. At this point there is no clinical reaction (rash, sneezing). Upon re-exposure, the allergen can bind to the specific antibody that orchestrates theimmune system to initiate a more aggressive and rapid response, resulting in an inflammatory response with clinical symptoms. However, many 'sensitised 'individuals do not experience clinical reactions upon subsequent exposure to allergen, a situation known as tolerance. The term polysensitisation usually refers to sensitisation to two or more allergen sources, and the term paucisensitisation has been used to describe sensitisation to between two and four allergens. Clinical reactivity can be difficult to diagnose in polysensitised patients because of problems distinguishing betweensensitisation to cross-reactive allergens. Cross-reactivity occurs when the molecular structure/shape of two different antigens is very similar and the antibody recognises the two different antigens as the same antigen; for example, an IgE antibody that recognises and causes an allergic reaction to Bet v 1 in birchpollen can also trigger an allergic response to Cor a1 in hazelnut. In nature there are many molecules with similar molecular structures/shapes and this translates into the clinic as an obstacle when trying to identify all potential allergens that might cause an allergic reaction in a given patient. Currently, patients undergoallergy testing to identify the allergens to which they are sensitive. This is based on skin prick testing orDOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

For both methods, it is difficult to identify multiple cross-reactive allergens for patients who appear to be polysensitised or have difficult to diagnose allergic disease. It has been claimed that multiplex allergentesting may provide improved information about the sensitisation profile in polysensitised patients. This assessment will summarise the available data on information provided by multiplex allergen testing, which is additional to that obtained from single IgE tests and/or skin prick or allergen challenge tests. It is difficult to obtain reliable statistics on allergy prevalence in the UK. The charity Allergy UK states, on its website, that there are an estimated 21 million adults in the UK who have at least one allergy and that an estimated 10 million of these have two or more allergies; 1however, these figures appear to be taken from a 2010 report on allergy and allergy remedies from the market research company Mintel. Data from the QRESEARCH project, a database containing the psuedoanonymised health records of over 13 million people, from 950 UK general practices,2can provide some information on the prevalence of allergy symptoms and diagnoses seen in primary care and on changing patterns over time. At the end of 2005, QRESEARCH data indicated that approximately one in nine people had a recorded diagnosis of 'any allergic disease '(including asthma, hay fever, eczema, anaphylaxis or peanut allergy); this figure represented a 27.7% increase over a 4-year period.3Increases in the incidence of eczema and allergic rhinitis were reported for the same time period; the age- and sex-standardised incidence of eczema was 9.58 per 1000patient-years in 2001, rising to 13.58 per 1000 patient-years in 2005, 4with the corresponding figures for allergic rhinitis being 5.57 per 1000 patient-years and 7.41 per 1000 patient-years, respectively.5 QRESEARCH data also indicate that the incidence of multiple allergic disorders is increasing. The age- andsex-standardised incidence of multiple allergic disorders was 4.72 per 1000 patient-years in 2001, rising to 6.28 per 1000 patient-years in 2005. 6Alongside data on increasing incidence of allergic disease, QRESEARCH reports also record increases in the number of allergy-related prescriptions and general practice consultations, which are indicative of an increasing burden upon the UK NHS.4-6There are no QRESEARCH publications that specifically report on food allergy. NICE Clinical Guideline 1167(food allergy in children and young people) reports an estimated prevalence for self-reported food allergy of between3% and 35% for individual foods. However, the guideline also notes that only 25-40% of self-reported food allergy is confirmed by oral food challenge (OFC) testing. 7 Allergic disease can present as a severe, life-threatening reaction (anaphylaxis). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network have recommended that anaphylaxis be defined as 'a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death' and is likely to be the diagnosis when there is involvement of skin or mucosal tissue (e.g. hives, angioedema) and airway compromise (wheezing, dyspnoea) and/or reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (hypotonia, syncope), along with a temporal relationship (minutes to several hours) to a potential causativeagent. 8There are limited data on the incidence of anaphylaxis in the UK. Hospital Episode Statistics record 'allergy (including anaphylaxis) 'as the primary diagnosis associated with Accident and Emergency attendance for around 70,000 cases (approximately 0.4% of all reports) in both 2013 and 2014; however,no separate statistics are recorded for anaphylaxis. 9A 2010 study,10based on the Health Improvement Network database, estimated the UK incidence of anaphylaxis at 21.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.6to 25.4] per 100,000 patient-years. This study included 382 cases of anaphylaxis and the causes werelisted as Clinical Guideline 13411,12(anaphylaxis assessment) reports an estimate of 20 UK deaths per year from anaphylaxis from a study conducted in 2000. A study published in 2015,13which analysed data from 1992 to 2012, shows that mortality has not risen, despite an increase in hospitalisations. Where data are available, this assessment will focus on studies conducted in the people with allergy that is difficult to manage. If data are lacking for this population, studies conducted in patients with specificallergic disease (e.g. peanut allergy) will not be excluded and all potential clinical applications of multiplex allergen testing will be considered.BACKGROUND AND DEFINITION OF THE DECISION PROBLEM(S) NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk4Intervention technologies ImmunoCAP Immuno-Solid ImmunoCAP a miniaturised immunoassay platform (multiple allergen components immobilised on a slide) that is intended to assess the presence of multiple antibodies in a single blood test. IgE antibodies from the patient 's blood sample bind to the immobilised allergen components on the slide, and allergen-bound IgE antibodies are then detected using fluorescence-labelled anti-IgE antibodies.Slides are read using a separate microarray scanner and image analysis software. Using these technologies may provide more detailed information about individual sensitisation profiles than single IgE testing. ImmunoCAP ISAC is intended for use in complex allergy cases, such as those with inconsistent casehistories/unsatisfactory response to treatment, those who are polysensitised and patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis. These are people with severe or unclear allergic disease who test positive to a range of allergens but in whom the true cause of symptoms can be difficult to identify. It is claimed that using theImmunoCAP ISAC test could improve health outcomes by improving allergy management, more appropriately targeting specific immunotherapy, and reducing the number of investigative diagnostic tests. These improvements could also lead to potential savings to the NHS from reducing the number of testsand avoiding the use of unnecessary immunotherapy. ImmunoCAP ISAC 112 is a molecular diagnostic test that can simultaneously test for IgE antibodies to 112 components from 51 allergen sources. The ISAC is a miniaturised immunoassay platform that uses asingle sample (30 l) of serum, plasma or capillary blood to test for IgE antibodies to multiple allergens. ImmunoCAP ISAC is a two-step assay. IgE antibodies from the patient sample bind to immobilised allergencomponents spotted in triplets on polymer-coated slides. Each slide contains four microarrays, givingresults for four samples per slide. The results are measured using a biochip scanner [confocal laser scanning devices, in particular the CapitalBio LuxScan 10k microarray scanner (Capitalbio, San Diego, CA, USA), are recommended] and evaluated using proprietary software produced by the same company,Phadia Microarray Image Analysis software (MIA) (Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). ImmunoCAP ISAC is a semi-quantitative test and results are reported in International Standard Units (ISUs), giving indications of specific IgE antibody levels; the operating range is 0.3 -100 ISU for IgE (ISU-E). This range approximately corresponds to a concentration range of 0.3 -100 kilo international units of allergen-specific-antibody per unit volume of sample (kUA/l) of IgE (1 kUA/l is equal to 2.4 ng/ml). The assay takes a total of 4 hours, including sample processing and incubation time. Microtest The Microtest Instrument is a CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne)-marked automated immunoassay platform that uses microarrays to simultaneously test for 26 allergen components. It is designed for processingand reading protein microarrays of allergens printed in the biochips. The Microtest instrument can simultaneously process up to five Microtest biochips, each containing a different serum sample, in each run. The process is fully automated. When the test is completed, the Microtest Instrument uses afluorimeter to read the microarrays and the results are semi-quantitative, reported on an allergy risk scale of 0 -4. The user can print or export the reports as appropriate. Microtest is intended for use in any patient (infants, children and adults) presenting with allergy symptoms. Table 1 summarises the key characteristics of the multiplex allergen tests ImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest, compared with comparator tests that are currently used in the standard diagnostic work-up of patients with difficult to manage allergic disease. There are a number of poorly understood factors that influence whether or not clinical symptoms manifest at a certain IgE level, including inhibitory allergen-specific antibodies of non-IgE subclass. Furthermore,other factors, for example age, patient population, concomitant exposure to other allergens, other clinical conditions such as infections, etc., can also affect the degree of symptoms which may occur following allergen exposure. Thus it is not possible to establish general cut-off values valid for all patients at all times.However, when combined with clinical history, the results of multiplex allergen testing may aid the clinicianDOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Multiplex allergen testing should always be used in conjunction with allergy-focused clinical history and may be used in addition to, or in place of, single IgE antibody tests and/or skin prick testing. Comparator The comparator for this assessment will be current standard care, which should always include allergy-focused clinical history and can additionally involve tests of IgE antibody status (single IgE antibody testing), tests of clinical reactivity such as skin prick testing or allergen challenge testing, or a combinationof these approaches. Single immunoglobulin E testing Allergen-specific IgE antibody assays are designed to detect and quantify circulating IgE antibodies to one allergen. The choice of which antibodies to test for is based on the clinical history of the patient, and several single IgE tests and/or a stepwise strategy which tests for the most likely causative agents first maybe required. The single IgE test process involves incubation of a blood sample with specific IgE antibodies. Allergen-specific IgE in the patient 's sample binds to the allergen, and unbound antibodies and excess sample are then removed by washing. Anti-IgE antibody, labelled to enable detection (e.g. fluorescently labelled anti-IgE antibody), is then added. The amount of bound allergen-specific IgE is calculated via a standard calibration curve, which is linked to the World Health Organization (WHO) IgE standard and reported in arbitrary massunits (kUA/l). Higher levels of IgE are considered to be associated with allergy, but the amount of IgE is not predictive of the severity of reaction. Not all patients with a positive specific IgE test will have clinically manifest allergic reaction when exposed to that allergen. Unlike IgE antibody testing, skin prick tests (SPTs) and allergen challenge tests can provide direct information about clinical reactivity to a given allergen. Skin prick testing Skin prick testing is a method used to assist in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergic disease in patientswith or gastrointestinal symptoms thatare suspected (based on clinical history) to be caused by type 1 (immediate) allergic reaction. It provides evidence for sensitisation in the form of reaction to allergenic stimulus. The test involves putting a drop of liquid allergen onto the skin, followed by a gentle pin prick through the drop. SPT interpretation utilises the presence and degree of skin reactivity as a marker for sensitisation. When relevant allergens are introduced into the skin, an IgE-mediated immune response occurs. Thisproduces a 'weal and flare 'response, which can be quantified. Many different allergens can be tested simultaneously because the resultant reaction to a specific allergen is localised to the immediate area ofthe SPT. One potential advantage of SPTs compared with in vitro measurement of IgE antibodies is that the test can be interpreted within 15 -20 minutes after the reagent is applied to the skin, and therefore results can potentially be given to the patient in the same consultation. SPT results provide evidence of IgE in skin-resident mast cells which may, but does not always, correlate with clinical reactivity. SPTs can also be utilised to test less common allergens, (e.g. medications, and fresh fruits and vegetables) where no specific IgE antibody assays are available. As with any test, the results of SPTs must be interpreted in the context ofmedical history, clinical symptoms and, where appropriate, other test results. It has been suggested that skin prick testing is an inexpensive option. However, whilst the test materials may be relatively inexpensive, any estimation of costs should consider the staff time needed to perform these tests in an appropriate andsafe health-care setting.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Allergen challenge testing Oral food challenges or inhalant challenges are indicated where there is a discrepancy between clinicalhistory and other test results, and can be useful in establishing the identity of specific triggers. The mostrigorous method for allergen challenge tests is double blinded and placebo controlled, thus requiring two separate visits. Therefore, single (patient)-blind and open challenges are more frequently performed because only one visit is required. An open challenge describes a challenge in which the patient canrecognise the target trigger and there is no attempt at blinding; this is the least time-intensive type ofchallenge test, but may produce less reliable results as there is the potential for the result to be influenced by either the patient 's anxiety about a particular trigger and/or the health-care professional 's expectations. The general methodology of any challenge test is to administer the trigger in gradually increasing doses in a medical setting. Allergen challenge tests should be performed in a setting that is fully equipped for emergency treatment if an episode of anaphylaxis occurs. Care pathway There are a number of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines that considerelements of the diagnosis, management and treatment of allergy. 7,11,14,15 Diagnosis Clinical guidelines consistently emphasise the importance of obtaining a clinical history and asking specific,allergy-focused questions. 7,15,16NICE Clinical Guideline 1167(food allergy in children and young people) states that this can be done by general practitioners or other primary health-care professionals with the appropriate competencies. According to the guidelines, the following should be included when taking a clinical history: lAny personal history of atopic disease (asthma, eczema or allergic rhinitis). lAny individual and family history of atopic disease (such as asthma, eczema or allergic rhinitis) or food allergy in parents or siblings. lDetails of any foods that are avoided and the reasons why. lAn assessment of presenting symptoms and other symptoms that may be associated with food allergy,including questions about: \u00a2the age of the child or young person when symptoms first started \u00a2speed of onset of symptoms following food contact \u00a2duration of symptoms \u00a2severity of reaction \u00a2frequency of occurrence \u00a2setting of reaction (e.g. at school or home) \u00a2reproducibility of symptoms on repeated exposure \u00a2what food and how much exposure to it causes a reaction.BACKGROUND AND DEFINITION OF THE DECISION PROBLEM(S) NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk10lCultural and religious factors that affect the foods they eat. lWho has raised the concern and suspects the food allergy. lWhat the suspected allergen is. lThe child or young person' s feeding history, including the age at which they were weaned and whether they were breastfed or formula fed -if the child is currently being breastfed, consider the mother 's diet. lDetails of any previous treatment, including medication, for the presenting symptoms and the response to this. lAny response to the elimination and reintroduction of foods. The NICE Clinical Guideline 5715(atopic eczema in children) recommends that health-care professionals should seek to identify potential trigger factors during clinical assessment College of Paediatrics and Child Health also provides advice on allergy-focused questions to beused when taking a clinical history. An initial screening set of questions is recommended to identify patients, in community settings, for whom a more detailed allergy history may need to be taken. If allergy is suspected, further questions are grouped into six areas: lgeneral history questions asking about general health, current medications, previous allergy testing,lifestyle and general home conditions lgeneral allergy history questions lfood-related questions lrespiratory-related questions lear-, nose- and throat-related questions lskin-related questions. If IgE-mediated allergy is suspected, based on the results of allergy-focused clinical history, NICE ClinicalGuideline 116 7(food allergy in children and young people) recommends that the child or young person should be offered a SPT and/or blood tests for specific IgE antibodies to the suspected foods and likelyco-allergens. It further recommends that these tests should be undertaken only by health-careprofessionals with the appropriate competencies to select, perform and interpret them, and should be undertaken only where there are facilities to deal with an anaphylactic reaction. 7The guideline also states that the patient should be given information on when, where and how an OFC or food reintroduction procedure may be undertaken. However, these tests should not be performed in primary care.7 Management The management of allergy is dependent upon type and severity and many allergies can be managed andtreated in primary care settings. More severe allergies and more complex patients may require additional management and referral on to specialist services.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

The NICE Clinical Guideline 57 (atopic eczema in children) and NICE Quality Standard 44 (atopic eczema in children)14,15both recommend that children with a suspected food allergy should be referred for specialist investigation and management by a paediatric allergist or paediatric dermatologist. With respect to management following a severe acute episode, NICE Clinical Guideline 13411(anaphylaxis assessment) recommends that prior to discharge a health-care professional with the appropriate skills and competencies should offer the following: linformation about anaphylaxis, including the signs and symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction linformation about the risk of a biphasic reaction linformation on what to do if an anaphylactic reaction occurs (use the adrenaline injector and callemergency services) la demonstration of the correct use of the adrenaline injector and when to use it ladvice about how to avoid the suspected trigger (if known) linformation about the need for referral to a specialist allergy service and the referral process linformation about patient support groups. Treatment Mild allergies can be treated using over-the-counter medications, such as antihistamines, and simpleavoidance of the identified allergen(s). The NICE Clinical Guideline 116 7(food allergy in children and young people) recommends that, once an allergy is suspected, based on clinical history, information should be provided to the patient about: ltype of allergy suspected lrisk of severe allergic reaction lpotential impact of the suspected allergy on other health-care issues, including vaccination.BACKGROUND AND DEFINITION OF THE DECISION PROBLEM(S) NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk12If a food elimination diet is advised information should be provided on: lwhat foods and drinks to avoid lhow to interpret food labels lalternative sources of nutrition to ensure adequate nutritional intake lthe safety and limitations of an elimination diet lthe proposed duration of the elimination diet lwhen, where and how an OFC or food reintroduction procedure may be undertaken. The NICE Clinical Guideline 5715(atopic eczema in children) recommends that health-care professionals should use a stepped approach for managing atopic eczema in children and should tailor the treatment step to the severity of the atopic eczema. Emollients should form the basis of atopic eczema management and should always be used, even when the atopic eczema is clear. Management can then be stepped upor down, according to the severity of symptoms, with the addition of the other treatments such as mild-potency topical corticosteroids (for mild eczema), moderate-potency topical corticosteroids (for moderate eczema), tacrolimus, bandages (for moderate or severe eczema), and potent topicalcorticosteroids, phototherapy and systemic therapy (for severe eczema only). Very potent topicalcorticosteroids should not be used without specialist dermatological advice. In selected patients allergen immunotherapy may be appropriate. It involves the repeated administration, either subcutaneously or sublingually, of allergen extracts. The potential outcomes of immunotherapy are: lreducing allergy symptoms on subsequent allergen exposure limproving of life (QoL) linducing long-term tolerance. Immunotherapy is time-consuming and expensive, and there is a risk of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis during administration. According to the British Society for Allergy & Clinical Immunology guidelines,17the main indications for immunotherapy in the UK are: lIgE-mediated seasonal pollen-induced rhinitis, if symptoms have not responded adequately to optimal pharmacotherapy lsystemic reactions caused by hymenoptera venom allergy lselected patients with animal dander or HDM allergy in whom rigorous allergen avoidance andreasonable pharmacotherapy fail to control symptoms. The selection, initiation and monitoring of all patients for immunotherapy should be supervised byspecialists in allergy. Immunotherapy should be administered only by physicians and nurses with specialist knowledge of allergy and specific immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is an attractive option for thetreatment of food allergies, as its goal is to induce tolerance in the person. With desensitisation, the treated person manifests a decreased response to the allergen. 17 Regarding treatment following severe acute episodes, NICE Clinical Guideline 13411(anaphylaxis assessment) recommends that after emergency treatment for suspected anaphylaxis patients should beoffered an appropriate adrenaline injector as an interim measure before the specialist allergy service appointment. An adrenaline autoinjector is a medical device for injecting a measured dose or doses ofepinephrine (adrenaline), by means of autoinjector technology. It is most often used for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Most individuals with a severe IgE-mediated food allergy are advised to carry an autoinjector in case of accidental exposure. There are many barriers to the successful use of an autoinjector, includingthe ability to recognise the symptoms of anaphylaxis, the availability and understanding of how to use the autoinjector, and anxiety associated with its use.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

The effect of allergies is described in two reports produced by Allergy UK. TheStolen Lives survey found that for 28.4% of respondents allergies had a serious effect on how they planned important life events, and for 26% their allergy severely affected their everyday life.18The report The Disturbing Impact of Skin Allergy and Sensitivity in the UK report19states that 78% of respondents suffered from reactions to their skin allergy all year round, and for 62% their condition had stopped themfrom going out socially and carrying out day-to-day activities. Where food allergy is diagnosed, implementing special diets for children can also be difficult for families to manage, particularly where there are multiple dietary requirements in one family. A 2010 20review on the psychosocial impact of food allergy and food hypersensitivity in children, adolescents and their families reported that non-allergic siblings often adopted the restricted diet that the allergic child followed. The same review20highlighted the effect of allergy on the QoL of patients and caregivers. It reported that allergy heightened patients 'and caregivers 'anxiety because of the need for constant vigilance, particularly in new situations. It also showed that parents tended to be overprotective of children with allergy, particularly those who have had anaphylaxis. There can also be anxiety for a parent or caregiver associated with administering an adrenaline injection.20BACKGROUND AND DEFINITION OF THE DECISION PROBLEM(S) NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk14Chapter 3 Assessment of clinical effectiveness Asystematic review was conducted to summarise the evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest for multiplex allergen testing in people with allergic disease. Systematic review methods followed the principles outlined in the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) guidance for undertaking reviews in health care21and the NICE Diagnostic Assessment Programme Manual .22 Systematic review methods Search strategy Development of search strategies followed the recommendations of the CRD guidance for undertaking reviews in health care.21Strategies were based on the technologies of interest. Candidate search terms were identified from target references, browsing database thesauri (e.g. MEDLINE MeSH and EMBASE Emtree) and from existing reviews identified during the initial scoping searches. These scoping searches were used to generate test sets of target references, which informed text mining analysis of high-frequency subject indexing terms using EndNote X7 reference management software (ThomsonReuters, CA, USA). Strategy development involved an iterative approach testing candidate text and indexing terms across a sample of bibliographic databases, aiming to reach a satisfactory balance of sensitivity and specificity. Search strategies were developed specifically for each database. The following databases were searched for relevant studies from 2005 to April 2015: lMEDLINE (via OvidSP): 1946 -week 2 April 2015 lMEDLINE In-Process Citations (via OvidSP): up to 15 April 2015 lMEDLINE Daily Update (via OvidSP): up to 15 April 2015 lPubMed [National Library of Medicine (NLM)] (internet) up to 22 April 2015* lEMBASE (via OvidSP): 1974 -14 April 2015 lCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (via Wiley): 2015/April/Iss4 lCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via Wiley): Cochrane Library 2015/March/Iss3 lDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (via Wiley): Cochrane Library 2015/January/Iss1 lHealth Technology Assessment database (HTA) (via Wiley): Cochrane Library 2015/January/Iss1 lScience Citation Index (SCI) (via Web of Science): 1970 -21 April 2015 lConference Proceedings Citation Index -Science (CPCI-S) (Web of Science): 1990 -21 April 2015 lBIOSIS Previews (via Web of Science): 1956 -21 April 2015 lLiterature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS) (internet; http://lilacs.bvsalud.org/en/): 1982 -22 April 2015 lNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (internet;www.hta.ac.uk/): up to 23 April 2015 lUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (internet; www.fda.gov): up to 23 April 2015. *An additional companion PubMed search was undertaken in tandem with MEDLINE via OvidSP; thisapproach aims to detect the latest 'ahead of print 'and 'online first 'electronic content promoted by many leading journals. A supplementary search was undertaken on the following resource to identify grey literature: lOpenGrey (internet; www.opengrey.eu): up to 22 April 2015DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.15Completed and ongoing trials were identified by searches of the following resources: lNational Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov (internet; www.clinicaltrials.gov/): up to 22 April 2015 lWHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (internet; www.who.int/ictrp/en/): up April Number (ISRCTN) Registry (internet; www.isrctn.com):up to 22 April 2015. The following key conference proceedings, were identified in consultation with clinical experts, and werescreened for the last 5 years where available: lAmerican Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) Annual Meeting lEuropean Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) lBritish Society for Allergy & (ISMA) lAmerican Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Meeting lBritish Association of Dermatologists (BAD). No restrictions on language or publication status were applied. Searches took into account generic and other product names for the intervention. See Appendix 1 for all search strategies. The main EMBASE strategy for each search was independently peer reviewed by a second Information Specialist, using the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Peer Review checklist.23Identified references were downloaded in EndNote X7 software for further assessment and handling. References inretrieved articles were checked for additional studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Population Adults and children with difficult to manage allergic disease who are being assessed in secondary or tertiary care settings. Owing to the paucity of available data, studies conducted in populations not specified as polysensitised or having difficult to manage allergic disease were also included. Allpresentations of allergic disease (respiratory, skin, gastrointestinal, anaphylaxis) were eligible for inclusion. Difficult to mange disease was defined as people who are allergic to two or more allergens and/or have allergies to unknown sources. Intervention/index test Multiplex allergen testing: lImmunoCAP ISAC Fisher Scientific/Phadia AB) lMicrotest (Microtest Matrices). Comparator The comparator for this assessment was current standard care, which included allergy-focused clinicalhistory, alternative tests of IgE antibody status (single IgE antibody testing), tests of clinical reactivity (such as skin prick testing or allergen challenge testing) or a combination of these approaches.ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk16Outcomes lClinical outcomes (e.g. allergy symptoms, incidence of acute exacerbations, mortality, AEs of testing and treatment, health-care presentations or admissions, HRQoL, patient anxiety/preferences). lChange to management, that is, change to treatment or treatment plan (e.g. restriction diets,immunotherapies, use of other medications such as corticosteroids, number of allergen challengetests required). lAdditional diagnostic information -accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) for the prediction of clinical reactivity, as defined by SPTs, allergen challenge tests or response to immunotherapy, plus numbers ofparticipants for whom multiplex allergen testing provided additional information (e.g. allergenscomponent-specific information, cross-reactivities, information on multiple sensitisation), diagnostic yield (number of participants with a definitive diagnosis). Study design There were no restrictions on study design. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, other comparative studies (e.g. 'before-and-after 'studies) and diagnostic test accuracy studies were eligible for inclusion. Observational study designs were eligible for inclusion only if they reported measures ofadditional diagnostic information provided by multiplex allergen testing; studies that assessed only concordance between multiplex allergen testing and single IgE antibody testing or other tests were not included. Protocol change The protocol stated that diagnostic accuracy studies would be included only if they reported both the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of multiplex allergen testing for the prediction of clinical reactivity, as defined by SPTs, allergen challenge tests or response to immunotherapy, and the numbers and details of participants for whom multiplex allergen testing provided additional information. No studies of this type were identified. The inclusion criteria were expanded to allow studies that reporteddirect comparisons of diagnostic accuracy between single IgE testing and multiplex allergen testing, using SPTs or allergen challenge tests as the reference standard. These studies do not address the primary aim of the project, 'to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people with difficult to manage allergic disease in secondary or tertiary caresettings ', because they provide no information on any additional benefit conferred by the use of multiplex testing. Studies of this type were included with the aim of providing some indication of the performanceof multiplex allergen testing, compared with current single IgE antibody testing practice, for predictingclinical response. Data of this type may inform the question of whether or not multiplex testing might, in some circumstances, replace single IgE testing as well as helping to guide possible future research recommendations. Inclusion screening and data extraction Two reviewers (MW and SL) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all reports identified bysearches and any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by consensus. Full copies of all studies deemed potentially relevant were obtained and the same two reviewers independently assessed these for inclusion; any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Details of studies excluded at the full paperscreening stage are presented in Appendix 3 . The principal investigators of completed trials (identified through searches of clinical trials registries) thatappeared to meet our inclusion criteria but for which no publication could be identified were contactedand asked to provide publication details or unpublished data. Data were extracted on the following: study details (including study design, country and funding); stated objective of the study; inclusion and exclusion criteria; participant characteristics (age, gender, primary presentation and previous allergy-related history); details of the multiplex allergen testing method used; details of the tests included in the standard care comparator (e.g. SPT, OFC, single IgE); details of thereference standard test (diagnostic accuracy studies only); outcome measures (included change toDOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Data were extracted by one reviewer, using a piloted, standard data extraction form, and checked by a second (MW and SL); any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Full data extraction tables are provided in Appendix 2 . Quality assessment We planned to use the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool to assess the methodological quality of RCTs;24however, no RCTs or non-RCTs were identified. The methodological quality of studies providing comparativeaccuracy data was assessed using QUADAS-2. 25Observational studies that used a 'before-and-after ' type of study design to assess the effects of adding information from multiplex allergen testing to thestandard diagnostic work-up in the same group of participants were assessed using a review-specific tooldesigned by the authors (MW, SL and NA). This tool has been designed to focus on elements of study design that we considered relevant to this specific study type, and is based upon the structure of the QUADAS-2 tool. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) cohort risk-of-bias tool was used to assessother observational studies. 26A narrative description of the potential limitations of any other included studies is provided. The results of the quality assessment have been used for descriptive purposes to provide an evaluation of the overall quality of the included studies and to provide a transparent method of recommendation for design of any future studies. Quality assessment was undertaken by one reviewerand checked by a second reviewer (MW and SL) and any disagreements were resolved by consensus. The applicability of studies to current UK practice was also considered and a narrative description of potential applicability issues is provided. The results of the risk-of-bias assessments are summarised andpresented in tables and graphs in the results of the systematic review (see Study quality ) and are presented in full, by study, in Appendix 4 . Methods of analysis/synthesis We planned to use a bivariate/hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic random-effects modelto generate summary estimates and a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve for testaccuracy data, 27-29and a DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model to generate summary estimates of treatment effects. However, because the review identified a small number of studies with between-study variations in participant characteristics (allergy history), multiplex allergen testing methods, allergens tested for, standard care comparators, and outcomes assessed, we did not consider meta-analyses to beappropriate and have provided a structured narrative synthesis. The results of studies included in this review are summarised by outcome type (clinical, change to management and diagnostic accuracy) and are further stratified by allergen type (food and aeroallergens). The results of individual studies are summarisedin text and tables. The results of studies providing comparative accuracy data are also illustrated in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space plots. Results of the assessment of clinical effectiveness assessment The searches of bibliographic databases and conference abstracts identified 8619 references. After initial screening of titles and abstracts, 169 were considered to be potentially relevant and ordered for full paper screening; of these, 20 were included in the review30-49and one50could not be obtained. All potentially relevant studies cited in documents supplied by the test manufacturers had already been identified by bibliographic database searches. Additional data, relating to the study by Hermansson et al. ,33,34were obtained through contact with the authors. Figure 1 shows the flow of studies through the review process, and Appendix 3 provides details, with reasons for exclusions, of all publications excluded at the full paper screening stage.ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk18Records identied through database searching (n = 12,137) MEDLINE, n = 1955 Medline in-process and daily update, n = 237 EMBASE, n = 5244 PubMed, n = 375 CENTRAL, n = 104 DARE, n = 0 CDSR, n = 41 HTA, n = 0 SCI and CPCI-S, n = 2626 BIOSIS, n = 1282 LILACS, n = 156 NIHR HTA programme, n = 0 FDA, n = 44 OpenGrey, n = 15 ClinicalTrials.gov, n = 40 ISRCTN, n = 4 WHO ICTRP, n = 14Conference searching (n = 349) AAAAI, n = 58 EAACI, n = 260 BSACI, n = 14 FAAM, n = 11 ISMA, n = 5 AAD, n = 0 BAD, n = 0 Additional records identied through other sources Information from manufacturers, n = 0 Contacting author, n = 1 Records after duplicates removed (n = 8619)Identication Screening Eligibility IncludedRecords screened (n = 8619)Records excluded (n = 8450) Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = 169) Studies included in qualitative synthesis n = 15 (20 publications) Additional unpublished data were obtained for one studyFull-text articles excluded (n = 130) Full-text articles identied as duplicates (n = 18) Unobtainable articles (n = 1) FIGURE 1 Flow of studies through the review process.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Two of the included studies39,40were conducted in the UK and, where reported, the remaining studies were conducted in other European countries; one study47did not report location. Of the 15 included studies, four were funded by,38,46or received reagents and consumables39or testing services45from, the manufacturer. Five studies were publicly funded32,42-44,49and six studies33,36,37,40,41,47did not report funding sources. Full details of funding are reported in the baseline study details tables (see Appendix 2 , Tables A -C). All of the included studies evaluated versions of ImmunoCAP one study33evaluated versions of ImmunoCAP ISAC and five studies36,40,41,46,47did not specify the version used. We did not identify any studies of Microtest which met the inclusion criteria for this review. We did not identify any studies that reported clinical outcomes (i.e. allergy symptoms, incidence of acute exacerbations, mortality, AEs of testing and treatment, health-care presentations or admissions, HRQoL,patient anxiety/preferences). Five studies 32,33,37,38,40assessed the effects on patient management of adding ImmunoCAP ISAC to the standard diagnostic work-up (SPT/single IgE); two studies33,40reported data on discontinuation or potential discontinuation of food avoidance diets, two studies32,38assessed changes to immunotherapy prescriptions, and one study37reported information on clinicians 'judgement of the utility of ImmunoCAP ISAC results in informing patient management. One study33assesed ISAC 96 and the remaining study40did not specify the version used. None of the five studies32,33,37,38,40reported the inclusion of patients with difficult to manage allergic disease; one study40reported inclusion criteria which may have been consistent with this classification (moderate to severe eczema and multiple food allergies); however, this study40was reported only as a conference abstract and hence provided very limited details of participants. One study40 was conducted in the UK, two studies32,37were conducted in Spain, and one study was conducted in each of Finland33and Italy.38 Two studies38,39assessed the effects on clinical diagnosis of adding ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 to the standard diagnostic work-up: one study39reported data on new sensitisations identified in patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis and assessed their clinical relevance and the other study38reported changes to the diagnostic classification made by clinicians following access to ImmunoCAP ISAC results and was conducted in patients with allergic rhinitis, with or without concomitant food allergy. One additional study36assessed the relationship between change in IgE levels, measured by ImmunoCAP single IgE and an unspecified versionof ImmunoCAP ISAC before and after a 3-year course of allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), and theclinicians 'evaluation of the benefit of SIT. None of these studies reported test accuracy data. One study 39 was conducted in the UK, one study38was conducted in Italy and one study36did not report location. Eight studies41-47,49compared the diagnostic accuracy of ImmunoCAP ISAC to that of alternative investigations (single IgE testing or SPT) to predict clinical reactivity as defined by SPT or OFC testing (the reference standard). Six studies41,42,44,46,47,49investigated people with food allergies and two studies43,45 investigated people with allergic rhinitis/respiratory symptoms. None of the eight studies41-47,49reported the inclusion of patients with difficult to diagnose and manage allergic disease, or described inclusion criteriathat could be considered consistent with this classification (e.g. polysensitised patients). One study 41 included patients with birch allergy, one study42included patients with suspected egg allergy, two studies44,49included patients with suspected cow 's milk and/or hen' s egg allergy, one study46includedASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk20patients with cow 's milk allergy, one study47included patients with hazelnut allergy, one study45included patients with symptoms of allergic rhinitis and one study43included patients with pollen allergy. None of the studies was conducted in the UK, seven studies41-46,49were European and one study47was unreported. Two studies investigated ISAC 103,42,43one study44investigated study49investigated ISAC 50, whereas three studies41,46,47used unspecified ISAC. Full details of the characteristics of study participants, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and intervention and comparator or reference standard are reported in the data extraction tables presented in Appendix 2 (see Tables A -E). Excluded studies One hundred and forty-eight full-text articles were retrieved: 18 were identified as duplicates and 130 were subsequently excluded. In all but two cases,51,52these studies reported no relevant outcomes. Further details of the 131 excluded full papers and the reasons for exclusion can be found in Appendix 4 . One study50could not be obtained. Study quality Studies of changes to management, treatment or diagnosis Seven studies investigated changes to treatment or management outcomes.32-34,36-40One very small cohort study,36with nine participants, assessed the relationship between change in IgE levels (measured by ImmunoCAP single IgE and an unspecified version of ImmunoCAP ISAC before and after a 3-year course of SIT) and the clinicians 'evaluation of the benefit of SIT. The methodological quality of this study36 was assessed using the CASP cohort tool. The remaining studies used a 'diagnostic before-and-after 'type study design, which compared clinicians' views and decisions on management, treatment or diagnosis in a single group of patients, before and after access to the results of multiplex allergen testing. Themethodological quality of these studies was assessed using a tool designed specifically for this review, which was based on the structure of QUADAS-2. Risk of bias and concerns regarding applicability are summarised in Tables 2 and 3and Figure 2 ; full assessments for each study are provided in Appendix 4 . The 'diagnostic before-and-after studies' were generally poorly reported, resulting in a high number of 'unclear 'ratings, with all studies rated as 'unclear 'risk of bias on at least one domain; four of the studies were published as conference abstracts only. 33,34,36,37,40Two studies33,38were rated as 'high 'risk of bias. One study33was rated as 'high 'risk of bias for patient selection; participants were selected from a database of children who were receiving special diets in school catering, and reasons for exclusion TABLE 2 Risk of bias for included diagnostic studies (change to management or treatment): review-specific QUADAS-2 StudyRisk Noimark 201240?? ?

The second study38was rated as 'high 'risk of bias for flow and timing because the standard care comparator differed between participants; all participants received SPT, and single IgE testing was used 'as required. 'Although this is likely to be representative of standard practice, it remains a potential source of bias when estimatingtest performance. Although this review included patients with any allergy, the primary objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of multiplex allergen testing in people with complex or difficult to manage allergies, in UK health-care settings. Studies that did not specify that they included participants with difficult to manageallergic disease, or describe inclusion criteria which could be considered consistent with this classification (e.g. polysensitised patients), were therefore rated as having 'high 'concerns regarding applicability. Studies that were conducted in non-UK settings and which assessed allergens considered unlikely to be relevant to UK populations (e.g. aeroallergens associated with Mediterranean countries) were also rated as having 'high 'concerns regarding applicability. Two studies 39,40were rated as having 'low'concerns regarding participant applicability, and in two studies33,37insufficient reporting details prevented a judgement and therefore they were rated 'unclear '. The remaining two studies32,38were rated as having 'high 'concerns regarding participant applicability: for both this was because the patients were not from the UK and in onestudy 38patients did not have difficult to manage disease. The small observational study36that was assessed using the CASP cohort tool for risk of bias was reported only as conference abstract; therefore, risk of bias was largely unclear owing to lack of study details. Studies of diagnostic accuracy Eight studies41-47,49compared the diagnostic accuracy of ImmunoCAP ISAC to that of alternative investigations (single IgE testing or SPT) to predict clinical reactivity as defined by SPT or OFC testing (the reference standard). The methodological quality of these studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool (summarised in Table 4 and Figure 3 ). The full QUADAS-2 assessments for each study are provided inAppendix 4 .

One study47was reported only as a conference abstract. Seven studies41-46,49were rated as 'high 'risk of bias on at least one domain. The main potential sources of bias were in relation to participant selection and application of the index test. Five studies41,43-46were rated as'high 'risk of bias for participant selection because they used a diagnostic case -control design, a design likely to produce inflated estimates of test performance, or applied inappropriate exclusion criteria (patients with eczema,44high levels of single IgE45or complex allergy43). Five studies41,43-46were rated as 'high 'risk of bias for the index test. In all cases this was because diagnostic thresholds were not prespecified, but were optimised using ROC analyses in the same population that was used to assess test performance, an approach that is likely to result in inflated estimates of test performance. Two of these studies41,42were also rated as 'high 'risk of bias for flow and timing, because not all the participants were included in the analysis41or because not all participants received the same reference standard.42 As was the case for studies of change to management, treatment or diagnosis, studies that did not specify that they included participants with difficult to manage allergic disease or describe inclusion criteria thatcould be considered consistent with this classification (e.g. polysensitised patients) were therefore rated as having 'high 'concerns regarding applicability, and studies that were conducted in non-UK settings and which assessed allergens considered unlikely to be relevant to UK populations (e.g. aeroallergens associated with Mediterranean countries) were also rated as having 'high 'concerns regarding applicability. All eight comparative accuracy studies 41-47,49were rated as having 'high 'concerns regarding participant applicability because they did not include people with difficult to manage allergic disease, and three ofthese studies 41,43,45also focused on allergens that were considered unlikely to be fully applicable to the UK. Effects on management, treatment and diagnostic classification of adding multiplex allergen testing to the diagnostic work-up of people with difficult to manage allergic disease Study details Six studies32,33,37-40assessed the effects of adding multiplex allergen testing to the standard diagnostic work-up (SPT/single IgE) on the management, treatment or diagnosis of patients. One study assessed ImmunoCAP ISAC 112,33three ISAC 9632and the remaining study used an unspecified version ImmunoCAP ISAC.40 All six studies32,33,37-40used a 'diagnostic before-and-after 'type study design to assess the effects of adding ImmunoCAP ISAC results to the information available to clinicians on their judgements regarding themanagement, treatment or diagnosis of a given group of patients. Change to management or treatment Two studies investigated the use of ImmunoCAP ISAC to guide decisions on the discontinuation of restrictive diets in children with food allergies.33,40Both studies were reported as conference abstracts only and hence provided only limited study details and results. Hermansson et al.33used a database to identify 199 school children in H\u00e4rk\u00e4tie, Finland, receiving special diets in school catering; (confidential information has been removed) (e-mail from Johannes Savolainen, University of Turku, Finland, to Shona Lang, 23 June 2015, personal communication). (Confidential information has been removed) (Johannes Savolainen, personal communication). The Hermansson study33did not report any information on clinical outcomes following changes to dietary management. Noimark and Harnik40investigated 12 children selected from patients attending an East London allergy clinic (no details of the selection criteria werereported). Participants were investigated using SPT and/or single IgE, and an unspecified version ofImmunoCAP ISAC. The authors reported that ISAC enabled potential food reintroductions (peanut n=4,DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

No details were reported of which single IgE/SPTs were conducted or which ISAC components were assessed.Noimark and Harnik 40did not report the number of food reintroductions that occurred following testing or clinical outcomes of any changes to dietary management. Two studies37,38assessed the views of clinicians on whether or not ImmunoCAP ISAC testing provided information useful in the management of patients. Luengo et al.37performed ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 testing in 55 well-characterised, polysensitised patients (as assessed by SPTs and single IgE tests) with various allergies; no details were reported of which ISAC components were assessed or how these were interpreted.Participating clinicians judged that ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 provided new information useful in the management of the patient in 50 (91%) cases. 37The added value was in the ability of ImmunoCAP ISAC to differentiate between protein homologues and hence to aid in the discrimination of allergens that were cross-immunoreactive rather than those that were responsible for sensitisation. In 34 (62%) cases the clinicians considered that it would have been useful to perform ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 testing before SPT, as several protein homologues can be investigated at once using ImmunoCAP ISAC.37Passalacqua et al.38 investigated 318 consecutive polysensitised (at least two positive SPTs) patients with respiratory allergy in sixallergy units in Italy. Participants were initially investigated using clinical history, SPT and single IgE testing (including mites, grass, olive, Parietaria , birch, and were assessed using ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 (no details reported of components assessed or interpretation, but cross-immunoreactive allergens were considered); treating clinicians wererequired to review their diagnosis/treatment based on the ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 results and provide a judgement of the value of any additional information provided. 38New information was classified as 'remarkable 'if it could not be obtained using standard diagnostic work-up and could impact upon accuracy of diagnosis or SIT prescription; new information related to patient management was classified as'remarkable 'in 299 (95%) cases and 'to some extent '(not defined) in 232 (73%) cases. 38 Two studies32,38investigated the effect on SIT prescriptions of adding ImmunoCAP ISAC testing to the standard diagnostic work-up of people with respiratory allergy. Passalacqua et al.38(described above) reported that a SIT prescription was made for 85 new patients, following testing with ImmunoCAP ISAC103, who would not have received SIT based on standard diagnostic work-up (SPT/single IgE) alone. In addition, the existing SIT prescription was changed in a further three patients, following ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 testing. 38Sastre et al.32investigated 141 people with respiratory allergy (with or without concomitant food allergy) in one allergy outpatient clinic in Spain. SIT indications were initially assessed based on clinical history and SPT (Olea e, Platanus a, Cupressus a, grass mix, Cynodon d, Phragmites c, Artemisia v, Salsola k and Plantago I), blind to the results of ImmunoCAP 96 testing (Ole e1, Cup Art v3 and Par j2). 32Clinicians then reassessed SIT indications based on all diagnostic information, including ImmunoCAP ISAC 96 results.32Disagreements on the SIT prescription based on standard diagnostic work-up and that based on all information, including ImmunoCAP ISAC, occurred for79 (54%) study participants; details are reported in Table 5 . 32Neither study reported details of which SIT prescriptions were actually used, or any subsequent clinical outcomes. Change to diagnostic classification Two studies investigated the effect on diagnostic classification of adding ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 testing to the standard diagnostic work-up of people with allergic disease.38,39Heaps et al.39investigated 110 patients, from five UK specialist allergy centres, who had a diagnosis of idiopathic anaphylaxis [based on clinical assessment, SPT, single IgE testing and mast cell tryptase (MCT)]. Study participants were reassessed using ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 and clinicians were asked to score the additional information provided.

In addition, this study38reported detailed information on changes to diagnostic category using five classifications (see Table 6 ); the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 testing resulted in increases in the numbers of people classified as 'poly sensitised with suspected cross-reactivity 'and the number of people diagnosed with both inhalant and food allergies, as well as facilitating a diagnosis for eight previously unclassifiable patients.38Full details are provided in Table 6 . Other We identified one additional study36that assessed the relationship between change in IgE levels measured by ImmunoCAP single IgE and change in IgE levels measured by an unspecified version of ImmunoCAPISAC before and after a 3-year course of SIT, and the clinicians 'evaluation of the benefit of SIT. This study 36included only nine participants who received a total of 31 courses of SIT (no details of diagnosis were reported). The median specific IgE levels, measured by ISAC, decreased from 5.6 ISU/ml at thebeginning of SIT to 0.01 ISU/ml at the end of SIT, and this change correlated with clinical benefit of SIT(evaluated by clinicians) (Spearman' sr=0.46; p=0.02). 36Conversely, allergen-specific single IgE measurements did not show a decrease from the beginning to the end of SIT.36 Summary The results of studies in this section provide some indication that the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC tostandard diagnostic work-up can change clinicians' views on the diagnosis, management and treatment of patients. There was some indication that the use of ImmunoCAP ISAC testing may guide decisions on the discontinuation of restrictive diets, the content of SIT prescriptions, and whether or not patients should receive SIT. However, importantly, none of the studies that we identified reported any information onclinical outcomes subsequent to changes in treatment or management based on ImmunoCAP ISAC. Threestudies report the usefulness of ImmunoCAP ISAC for discriminating allergens that are structurally similar and are recognised by the same IgE antibody (cross-immunoreactive); this discrimination appears to be particularly useful for identifying the cause of food allergies. The UK-based study on the use ofImmunoCAP ISAC to investigate idiopathic anaphylaxis indicated that the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC to standard diagnostic work-up may identify a potentially causative agent in previously undiagnosed patients. However, it should be noted that the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC also resulted in the identification oflarge numbers of sensitisations that were not considered to be associated with the anaphylaxis, that is, large numbers of clinically false-positive test results or sensitisations associated with other allergic conditions such as rhinitis.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

None of the studies looked at ISAC 112, two investigated ISAC 103,42,43one investigated 50/5145,49and three investigated unknown ISAC versions.41,46,47The results of the comparative diagnostic accuracy studies are summarised in Table 7 . Diagnosis of food allergy De Swert et al.41investigated soy flour allergy. The diagnostic accuracy of an unknown ISAC version to measure the soy flour component rGly m4 was compared with the single IgE test for the same componentand to a SPT for soy flour. Cut-off values were reported separately for each test and OFC testing was used as the reference standard. ISAC had the highest sensitivity, 86% (95% CI 42% to 100%), but the lowest specificity, 80% (95% CI 28% to 100%). The single IgE test and SPT had similar sensitivity (75%) andspecificity (100%). Alessandri et al. 42investigated allergy to boiled or raw egg. The diagnostic accuracy of ISAC 103, when used to measure three individual egg components (Gal d1 or Gal d2 or Gal d3), was compared with the accuracy of single IgE tests (egg yolk or egg white) and compared with the accuracy of SPTs (egg white extract or raw egg white or boiled egg white or egg yolk extract or raw egg yolk or boiled egg yolk). Cut-off values were reported separately for each test and OFC testing was used as the reference standard.SPT had the highest sensitivity for prediction of allergic response to raw egg white, 88% (95% CI 71.8% to 96.6%), whereas Gal d3 measured using ISAC 103 had the highest specificity, 100% (95% CI 90% to 100%). Results for raw egg were similar to those for boiled egg. In general, single IgE performed similarlyto SPT (both measured whole extracts), whereas ISAC 103 gave much more variable results for the three different components measured. No measure of the overall diagnostic performance of ISAC 103 (all components combined) was reported. Two studies 44,49investigated allergy to cow 's milk and hen 'se g g .D 'Urbano et al.44compared the accuracy of ISAC 89, used to measure two individual components (Gal d1 or Bos d8), to the accuracy of single IgE tests (egg white or cow 's milk). Cut-off values were reported separately for each test and OFC testing was used as the reference standard. Specificity was consistent (96%) for both ISAC 89 components and for cow 's milk and egg white single IgE. Sensitivity values were higher for ISAC 89 components (78% for Bos d8 and 73%for Gal d1) than for the corresponding whole-allergen single IgE tests (41% for cow 's milk and 27% for egg white). When whole-allergen single IgE tests and ISAC 89 were used in series (i.e. ISAC 89 results were considered only in single IgE-negative participants), the combined sensitivity was greater than that for single IgE alone (84% compared with 41% for cow 's milk allergy, and 73% compared with 27% for hen 'se g g allergy); specificity was 92% in both cases. Ott et al. 49compared the accuracy of ISAC 51, used to measure eight individual components ( -casein, -casein, -casein, Bos d4, Bos d5, Gal d1, Gal d2, Gal d4), with the accuracy of single IgE tests (hen 's egg or cow 's milk extract) and to the accuracy of SPTs (native hen 's egg or native cow 's milk). Cut-off values were reported separately for each test and OFC testing was used as the reference standard. The results were very variable between tests. SPT had the highest sensitivity for cow 's milk allergy, 93.6% (95% CI 78.5% to 99%). The ISAC 51 components all had low sensitivity for cow 'sm i l k allergy (ranging from 23.9% to 50% for the five components assessed). Conversely, all five ISAC 51components had high specificity for cow 's milk allergy (ranging from 88.4% to 97.7%), whereas SPT had low specificity, 48.2% (95% CI 28.7% to 68%). Single IgE testing had the highest sensitivity for hen 's egg allergy, 71.1% (95% CI 55.7% to 83.6%). All three ISAC 51 components had low sensitivity (ranging from 17.8%to 57.8%) and high specificity for hen 's egg allergy; the individual specificities of the ISAC 51 components were 100% for Gal d4, 86.7% for Gal d1 and 80% for Gal d2. Single IgE testing and skin prick testing hadcomparable specificity (86.7% and 100%, respectively). No measure of the overall diagnostic performance ofISAC 51 (all relevant components combined) was reported for either cow 'sm i l ko rh e n 's egg allergy.ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk32TABLE 7 Accuracy of ImmunoCAP ISAC, compared with other allergen testing techniques a73.7 (48.8 to 90.9)aThe authors concludedthat the association among symptoms and sIgE profile should be carefully investigatedconsidering the natural history and evident food allergyCor.a.1.0401 (NR) 7 9 3 16 43.8 (19.8 to 70.1) a84.2 (60.4 to 96.6)a Cor.a.8 (NR) 2 14 (1.6 to 38.3)a89.5 (66.9 to 98.7)a Cor.a.9 (NR) 1 15 0 19 6.3 (0.2 to 30.2)a100 (82.4 to 100)a sIgE Hazelnut (0.35 kUI/l) 16 0 15 4 100 (79.4 to 100)a21.1 (6.1 to 45.6)a SPT NR (>3 mm diameter) 16 0 9 10 100 (79.4 to 100)a52.6 (28.9 to 75.6)a Alessandri2011 4268, bNRbNRbNRb61 (42.1 to 77.1) 97 (85.1 to 99.9) The authors reported that evaluation of 103allergenic molecules by means of the ISAC microarray approach allowed detection of significant clinicalsensitisations to other important allergenic sources, confirming that hen 's egg sensitisation is often associated with other sensitisations to food and inhalantsGal d2 (0.21) NR d3 (0.06) NRbNRbNRbNRb18 (7 to 35.5) 100 (90 to 100) sIgE Egg white (1.23) NRbNRbNRbNRb79 (61.1 to 91) 71 (45.1 to 79.6) white extract (8) NRbNRbNRbNRb84 (67.2 to 94.7) 77 (59.9 to 89.6) Raw egg white (48) NRbNRbNRbNRb88 (71.8 to 96.6) 80 (63.1 to 91.6) to to 99.3) NRbNRbNRbNRb70 to to 93.4) Raw egg (8.4) NRbNRbNRbNRb79 (61.1 to to 91.6) egg 94 (80.8 to 99.3) continuedDOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

The diagnostic accuracy of an unknown ISAC version, used to measure nine individual components (Bos d 4, Bos d 6, Bos d 7, Bos d 8, casein -S1, casein and casein , Bos d lactoferrin, Bos d 5.0101), was compared with the accuracy of single IgE tests for four allergens (whole milk, -lactoalbumin, -lactoglobulin and casein). For both methods, a positive result was defined as positive for at least one component or whole allergen; the cut-off values used to define positivity for individualcomponents and allergens were not reported. OFC testing was used as the reference standard. Both combinedISAC testing and combined single IgE testing had 100% sensitivity; however, ISAC testing had much higherspecificity, 91.7% (95% to than (95% CI 18.8% to 59.4%). Albarini et al. 47investigated hazelnut allergy. The diagnostic accuracy of an unknown ISAC version, used to measure four individual components (Cor.a.1.1010, Cor.a.1.0401, Cor.a.8, Cor.a.9), was compared to the accuracy of single IgE tests (hazelnut) and to SPT. Cut-off values were not reported for the ISAC test. OFC testing was used as the reference standard. Both the SPT and the single IgE test had 100% sensitivity,whereas the ISAC components generally had low sensitivity (ranging from 6.3% to 56.3%). However, the ISAC components had higher specificity (ranging from 73.7% to 100%) than either single IgE (21.1%) or skin prick testing (52.6%). Diagnosis of aeroallergy W\u00f6hrl 200645investigated five different aeroallergens (HDM, cat dander, birch pollen, grass pollen and mugwort pollen). The diagnostic accuracy of ISAC 50, used to measure the presence of one or moreaeroallergens (up to five), was compared with the accuracy of single IgE tests of whole allergens. Where multiple ISAC components were assessed, a positive result was defined as positive for at least one component. The cut-off points for each test were not reported. Skin prick testing was used as thereference standard. The specificity of ISAC 50 was high for all aeroallergens investigated, regardless of whether a single component or multiple components were assessed (range 89.9-98.1%), and, with the exception of mugwort pollen, was comparable to the specificity estimate for the corresponding wholeallergen single IgE test for all aeroallergens investigated (see Table 7 ). The sensitivity of ISAC 50 was lower than that of single IgE tests for HDM, cat and mugwort pollen. The sensitivities and specificities of theindividual components ISAC 50 components were not reported. Cabrera-Freitag et al. 43investigated two different pollens (grass pollen or Phleum pratense and cypress pollen or C. arizonica ). Two cut-off points (manufacturers 'recommended and ROC optimised) were reported per test and SPT was used as the reference standard. The diagnostic accuracy of ISAC 103, when used to measure the eight components for grass pollen with the accuracy of a single IgE test to measure P. pratense ; a positive result was defined as positive for at least one component. The sensitivity and specificity for ISAC 103 and single IgE were similar, irrespective of the cut-off point used. Sensitivity and specificity estimates for individual grass pollen ISAC 103 components were not reported. In addition, the accuracy of ISAC 103 was used to measure the presence of a one component for cypress pollen (nCup a1) in comparison withthe accuracy of single IgE tests to measure C. arizonica. The sensitivity estimates for the two tests were equal at both cut-off points (91.7%); however, specificity was higher for ISAC 103 at both cut-off points(91.3% and 95.6%) than for the single IgE test (range 80.4 -89.1%). Summary The diagnostic performance of ImmunoCAP ISAC in comparison with other tests (single IgE and SPT) variedconsiderably between studies, according to the allerg ens investigated and the way in which ISAC testing was applied. In general, individual ISAC components tended to have high specificity, but low sensitivity, relative to whole-allergen single IgE tests or SPT for the prediction o f allergic response. The rela tively low sensitivities of individual ISAC components are likely to be indicativ e of the proportions of patients in whom each component is associated with the observed allergic response. Conversely, a high specificity is indicative of a strong association between ISAC positivity for the individual component and an allergic response to whole allergen. However, when ISAC was used to measure the same component as single IgE testing or to measure multiple components (homologous proteins), with a positive test defined as any component positive, it appeared thatDOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

The ability of ImmunoCAP ISAC to discriminate between allergens that are structurally similar and are recognised by the same IgE antibody (cross-immunoreactive) may represent clini cally useful additional information (see Effects on management, treatment and diagnostic cla ssification of adding multiplex allergen t esting to the diagnostic work-up of people with difficult to manage allergic disease , above). Therefore, if the focused use of groups of ISAC components can achieve equivalent sensitivity and specificity to t hat of single IgE testing, ISAC testing may be preferred. The results of the only study to investigate serial testing suggested that use of ImmunoCAP ISAC after single IgE testing only in participants who were negative on single IgE could increase sensitivity relative to single IgE alone without any loss in specificity. None of the comparative diagnostic accuracy studiesincluded in this review was conducted in people with difficult to manage allergic disease, and all studies investigated the diagnostic performance of a limited range of ISAC components of a specified allergen. These studies are therefore unable to provide any information on the specificity of the whole ISAC panelwhen used to investigate people with difficult to manage allergic disease, that is, the extent to which the multiplex allergen testing may produce 'false-positive 'results by detecting sensitisations that are not clinically relevant. This indicates the importance of using confirmatory tests after the array and that the current array cannot wholly replace OFC or SPT as a diagnostic procedure.ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk40Chapter 4 Assessment of cost-effectiveness This chapter explores the cost-effectiveness of multiplex allergen testing compared with current clinical assessment in patients referred for specialist allergy investigation in secondary or tertiary care settings. More specifically, the following research question will be addressed: lWhat is the cost-effectiveness of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people withdifficult to manage IgE-mediated allergic disease in secondary or tertiary care settings? Review of economic analyses of multiplex allergen testing Search strategy Searches were undertaken to locate relevant economic evaluations on adults and children undergoing specialist allergy investigation in secondary or tertiary care settings. The following databases were searched for relevant studies from 2005 to May 2015: lNHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (via Wiley): 2005 -Issue 2 of 2015/May/Iss2 lIDEAS Research Papers Economics (internet; http://repec.org/): 2005 -26 May 2015 lEconLIT (via EBSCOhost ): 2005 -21 May 2015 lEMBASE (via OvidSP): 1974 -21 May 2015 lMEDLINE (via OvidSP): 1946 -May Week 3 2015 lMEDLINE In-Process and Daily Update (via OvidSP): up to 20 May 2015. Inclusion criteria Studies reporting outcomes of a full cost-effectiveness analysis, with (at least) one of the comparators including multiplex allergen testing, were eligible for inclusion. Quality assessment Included studies are appraised using a quality checklist based on that of Drummond et al.53 Results The literature search identified 311 records from bibliographic database searches and supplementarysearching (e.g. reference/citation checking, additional database searches including the database search forthe assessment of clinical effectiveness). After removing duplicates, and title and abstract screening, 15 records were considered to be potentially relevant; after full-text screening four studies (nine publications, all abstracts) were considered eligible for inclusion ( Figure 4 ). All four included studies are authored by Hermansson (as either first or second author), an employee of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Three studies, reported in six publications, 33,34,54-57considered multiplex allergen testing for children with suspected food allergy (specifically peanut allergy in two studies) and one study, reported in three publications,58-60 considered multiplex allergen testing for patients sensitised to pollen. These studies are described in more detail below and summarised in Table 8 . The results of the quality assessment are shown in Table 9 . Hermansson 2014 Hermansson et al.33,34considered the cost-effectiveness of ImmunoCAP ISAC in addition to a standard diagnostic work-up compared with standard diagnostic work-up without ImmunoCAP ISAC for Finnishschool children with a restricted diet as a result of suspected food allergy (community setting). The analysiswas informed by 24 children from a larger database (including a total of 2317 school children). The results indicated an unnecessary restricted diet for 63% of the children, resulting in a cost per avoided unnecessary diet of \u20ac480 for ImmunoCAP ISAC.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

For this purpose, a Markov model was constructed with a 5-year time horizon. Health states included non-allergic and allergic, and mild and severe allergic reactions were modelled as events. The costs were considered for Sweden, the USA and China. The results indicated that ImmunoCAPISAC is least expensive, whereas SPT is most expensive, in all three countries. Moreover, ImmunoCAP ISACwas also found to be most effective, leading to 3.97 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), whereas the DBPCFC strategy is least effective (2.54 QALYs). Consequently, ImmunoCAP ISAC dominated both the SPT and DBPCFC Glaumann et al.57examined ISAC compared with DBPCFC, open OFC and SPT for children with suspected peanut allergy in Sweden. A Markov model with a 5-year time horizon was constructed for this purpose. Health states included non-allergic and allergic, and mild and severe allergic reactions were modelled as events. The results indicated that ImmunoCAP ISAC is leastexpensive, whereas SPT is most expensive. Furthermore, ImmunoCAP ISAC was also found to be mosteffective, leading to 4.34 QALYs, whereas the OFC strategy was considered least effective (2.23 QALYs). Consequently, ImmunoCAP ISAC dominated all three alternative strategies. Mascialino and 2012 Mascialino the cost-effectiveness of ImmunoCAP ISAC with SPT compared with SPT only for Spanish patients sensitised to pollen in a complex pollen area. The analysis was based on a Markov model with a 9-year time horizon and the assumption that patients on specific immunotherapy (SIT) continue this treatment for 3 years and remain healthy for the subsequent 6 years or discontinue SIT and move to symptom management treatment until year 9. The analysis was informedby a data set of 141 patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma sensitised to pollen. 32The results indicated that the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC to SPT reduces SIT prescriptions and hence results in costsavings compared with SPT only ( \u20ac2538 vs. \u20ac2608). ImmunoCAP ISAC with SPT was also found to be more effective (7.03 QALYs) than SPT only (6.88 QALYs); hence ImmunoCAP ISAC with SPT dominated SPT only. Quality assessment and summary of studies in the cost-effectiveness review All four studies33,34,54-60reported benefits associated with adding ImmunoCAP ISAC to the diagnostic work-up (increased effectiveness), and three out of four studies also showed cost savings when using ImmunoCAP ISAC. However, as all included studies were reported only as conference abstracts, the methods and assumptions used were largely unclear; this severely hampered the assessment of the validity of theresults. It was often unclear precisely which diagnostic strategies were examined. The lack of information about these studies is illustrated in Table 9 (study quality checklist for included papers). Besides this transparency issue, the credibility of the sources used in these studies may be questionable. Fundamental inputs of the model were based on expert opinion, inaccessible references, or no references were provided (information was still lacking after full retrieving of copies of the posters and a presentation supplied by the authors). For example, the numbers of true positives, false positives, false negatives and true negatives forImmunoCAP ISAC appeared to be based on expert opinion in most cases. 33,34,54-57,59,60In addition, two assessments from this group54-57focused on the same population, both using a Markov model with a 5-year time horizon, but the reported QALYs and outcomes differed substantially (see Table 8 ). In conclusion, the available economic assessments indicate that the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC will increase effectivenessand can be cost-saving. However, given the lack of detail on how these results were produced and the use of expert opinion for key inputs, these findings should be interpreted with extreme caution. Overview of potentially relevant excluded studies In addition to the included studies described above, one potentially relevant study61that considered the incremental costs of multiplex allergen testing was excluded, as it did not report effectiveness outcomes and, as a result, was not considered to be a full cost-effectiveness analysis. For completeness, the results ofASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk46this study61(also reported only as a conference abstract) are summarised below (despite efforts in contacting the authors, the full copy of the poster could not be retrieved). The study by Rodriguez-Ferran et al.61considered the costs of SPT, Phadiatop and ImmunoCAP Rapid for screening respiratory allergy in children in primary care. Their results showed that SPT is least expensive (\u20ac10-15), followed by ImmunoCAP\u00aeRAPID (Thermo Fisher Uppsala, Sweden; The authors stated that they believe SPT is cost-effective.

This limitation was applied in order to be pragmatic and focus on allergies for which there was at least some evidence, albeit limited, from the clinical effectiveness review. Non-English-language studies were excluded. Results Searches identified 1300 (1074 after removing duplicates) potentially relevant publications, of which 1028were excluded at the abstract screening stage. Full texts were obtained for the 46 publications that werepotentially relevant. Thirty-one publications were excluded at the full-text screening stage because no utility values were reported ( n=29) or the study was not written in English ( n=2). Four of the excluded publications were reviews. The studies included in these reviews were all present in the search results. Three additional publications were identified through reference checking of the included studies. The four studies 33,34,54-59identified in the review of economic analyses of multiplex allergen testing were also identified in this review, but excluded because no original utility data were provided. Seventeen publications were included,62-77describing 14 studies ( Figure 5 ). Fourteen studies reporting health-state utilities for allergic conditions were found. Ten studies, reported in13 publications, used the EuroQol instrument, and reported either the European Quality of Life-5Dimensions (EQ-5D) utility score 62-67or the visual analogue scale (VAS) score.68-73One study reported utilities obtained by the HUI Mark III instrument.74Three studies used a direct utility elicitation technique.75-77The 10 studies reported on 28 populations: 14 studies with rhinitis/rhinosinusitis/ rhinoconjunctivitis/asthma,62-66,68-73,7811 studies with eczema,67,73,75-77two studies with food allergy73,74and one study with mixed allergies except food allergies.74Utility values ranged from 0.5000 for patients with allergic rhinitis receiving allergy vaccination72to 0.970 for persons with mild eczema.76Patients who sought help from a specialised allergy clinic (to receive allergy vaccination) and patients currently exposed to allergens seemed to have lower utility scores than the other populations. Only two studies reported on the relationship between the severity of allergic symptoms and utility value75,76(Table 10 ).DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

In this study79the impact of anaphylactic shock on QoL was, in absence of utility evidence, assumed by the authors to be equal to zero utility for a duration of 9 days at maximum. lMeadows et al.80investigated immunotherapy in adults and children with seasonal allergic rhinitis. They used mapping to obtain EQ-5D change scores from changes in scores on the RhinoconjunctivitisQuality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). 81The RQLQ scale ranges from 0 (best) to 6 (worst). It was assumed that the top end of the scale maps to the EQ-5D state representing no problems in any of the five dimensions. The bottom end of the RQLQ scale was mapped to the EQ-5D state representing maximum problems with usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, but no problems withmobility or self-care, which were assumed to be unaffected by seasonal allergic rhinitis. This state has a QoL score of -0.07 on the standard UK tariff. As a result, going from worst to best was a 6-point reduction in RQLQ and a 1.07-point increase in the EQ-5D score. Each unit decrease (improvement) in RQLQ was assumed to map to a 0.178-point increase in QoL score (assuming that a unit decrease hasthe same value at all points on the scale). The authors state that it could be argued that mapping the RQLQ to the whole range of three of the five dimensions of the EQ-5D scale could have led to an overestimation of utility gains, as the bottom score of -0.07 on the EQ-5D (representing a state worse than death) would not be equivalent to the worst score on the RQLQ. lGarside et al.82investigated the effectiveness of treatments for atopic eczema. In the absence of utility values in the literature they used a UK Utility Panel ( n=15 laypeople) to estimate utilities for three severity stages of atopic eczema using the standard gamble. They used the Dermatology Life Quality Index83to develop scenarios and obtained valuations of these using SG. The median results were 0.985 for mild eczema, 0.875 for moderate eczema and 0.675 for severe eczema. Methodology The aim of this assessment was to compare the cost-effectiveness of adding multiplex allergen testing tocurrent clinical practice with current clinical practice alone for people with difficult to manage IgE-mediated allergic disease in secondary or tertiary care settings. In this setting, multiplex allergen testing might be usedto inform clinical decisions (e.g. to perform a food challenge and/or to initiate SIT) through aiding allergy diagnosis, predicting the probability of allergic reactions and/or predicting response to SIT. However, given the paucity of data on the clinical effectiveness of multiplex allergen testing (see Chapter 3 ), no long-term cost-effectiveness model is developed. This is in accordance with the published protocol for this assessment (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42015019739). More specifically, the lack of data on the clinical consequences of adding multiplex allergen testing to current clinical practice renders the development of along-term economic model unusable to inform health policy decision-making. Instead of developing a long-term cost-effectiveness model, the following sections aim to inform research decisions and support future model-based economic evaluations and include the following components: lrelevant cost-effectiveness analyses are identified and reviewed (see Review of economic analyses of multiplex allergen testing, above) lavailable health-state utility studies are identified and reviewed (see Review of health-related quality of life studies, above) lthe current clinical diagnostic pathway as well as the potential place for multiplex allergen testing areexamined (see Current clinical diagnostic pathways , below) la concept model structure is developed (see Model structure , below) la survey is performed to retrieve the proportions of patients receiving each test (see Model parameters , below)DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Current clinical diagnostic pathways Current clinical diagnostic pathways for patients referred for specialist allergy investigation in secondary or tertiary care settings may include SPT, single IgE testing and an OFC test where appropriate, combined with clinical history. SPT is often the first investigation performed in allergy diagnostics.84,85Based on consultations with clinical experts, it is assumed that single IgE testing will be performed in cases where the results of the SPT are not consistent with the clinical history of a patient (e-mail from Roisin Fitzsimons, Guys and St Thomas 'NHS Foundation Trust, 15 July 2015, personal communication). Inconsistency can occur if the SPT for the most likely allergen (based on clinical history) is negative or if a SPT is positive for an allergen that does not seem to explain the symptoms completely. Additionally, an OFC test is usually performed to confirm or rule out allergy to a specific food-related allergen or allergens.85-87If SPT is not considered acceptable/practical (e.g. in children with atopic eczema), single IgE testing might be the first-line investigation, using confirmatory OFC or SPT as necessary. Moreover, it might be possible toproceed to OFC based on SPT (and patient history) alone. Figure 6 provides an overview of the possible diagnostic pathways with and without SPT. It should be noted that it is unclear whether or not thistheoretical diagnostic pathway (based on clinical expertise and literature) is representative of current UKclinical practice in all secondary or tertiary care settings.

Its role would be to identify which allergensa patient is sensitive to. Any allergens identified would have to be confirmed by SPT or OFC. The potential advantage of the array is that it can simultaneously test for homologous proteins or cross-sensitive proteins and therefore can aid the clinician in tailoring which confirmatory tests are required. For example, if the testis negative for particular proteins this might rule out the need for OFC. It is likely that multiplex allergentesting would replace single IgE testing, although some single IgE testing might still be required, for example if the array does not test for all suspected allergens.

However, this might not always be thecase, as multiplex allergen testing may also be performed instead of single IgE testing (see Figure 7a andd). The most important point is that multiplex allergen testing would be likely to reduce the number of singleIgE tests, by ruling out particular allergens, thereby reducing the need for OFC. Model structure This section describes a model structure that could potentially be used to assess the cost-effectiveness ofmultiplex allergen testing compared with current clinical practice for people with difficult to manageallergic disease in secondary or tertiary care settings. Three comparators would be evaluated in the economic model: lImmunoCAP ISAC testing lMicrotest testing lcurrent (standard) diagnostic pathway. The health-economic model would potentially consist of a decision tree and a state-transition (i.e. Markov)model. The decision tree can be used to model the short-term outcomes, based on test results and the accompanying treatment decision. These outcomes consist of 'at risk of allergic reaction (treated) ','not at risk of allergic reaction (treated) ','at risk of allergic reaction (untreated) 'and 'not at risk of allergic reaction (untreated) '. Moreover, potential AEs of testing can be considered in the decision tree. The decision tree is shown in Figure 8 . The long-term consequences in terms of costs and QALYs can be estimated using a state-transition cohortmodel ( Figure 9 ) with a lifetime time horizon. The initial health state in the state-transition model is determined by the short-term outcome from the decision tree. The following health states are included in the state-transition model: lat risk of allergic reaction lnot at risk of allergic reaction/remission lallergic reaction (experienced during cycle) ldeath (either background mortality or death due to an allergic reaction). Different types and severities of allergic reactions can be included in the model separately. Given the diversity of allergy reactions, which depend on the type of allergy, separate models would ideally bedeveloped for separate populations, for example those suspected of having clinical reactivity to an inhaled versus an ingested allergen. Model parameters Decision tree To inform the decision tree for the diagnostic pathway the following parameters are required: lproportion of patients who receive a particular test (i.e. SPT, single IgE test, multiplex allergen test and/or OFC test) as well as the number of SPTs and/or single IgE tests per patient laccuracy of the diagnostic pathways (i.e. proportion of true positives, false positives, false negatives and true negatives as a result of the combined diagnostic performance of SPT, single IgE and/or multiplex testing) lthe treatment without 'true allergy')False negative (negative test with 'true allergy')False positive (positive test without 'true allergy')True positive (positive test with 'true allergy')Population Patients with (suspected) complex allergic disease As above As aboveTreatmentc As aboveNo treatment As aboveTreatment Treatment No treatmentShort-term outcome As aboveNot at risk of allergic reaction (untreated) As aboveAt risk of allergic reaction (treated) Not at risk of allergic reaction (treated) At risk of allergic reaction (untreated) FIGURE 8 Potential decision tree for the diagnostic pathway. a, Standard diagnostic pathway may consist of SPTs, single IgE testing and/or food challenge (see Figure 6 ); b, multiplex allergen testing might be performed in addition to the standard diagnostic pathway or instead of (part of) the standard diagnostic pathway (see Figure 7 ); c, treatment may consist of immunotherapy and/or symptom management (i.e. antihistamines and/or avoidance of the allergen) and is likely to lower the likelihood and/or severity of an allergic reaction.86DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.55The proportions of patients receiving a particular test and the number of tests per patient are unclear for both the standard diagnostic pathway and the diagnostic pathway including multiplex allergen testing.To alleviate this issue, a survey was sent to clinicians to inform these parameters (see Appendix 6 for the survey). However, no valid responses were received for multiplex allergen testing; the only respondent who indicated having any experience with ImmunoCAP ISAC responded that the number of OFC tests used was too few to comment on. Hence it was not possible to use the survey results in the cost analyses. Moreover,as described in the systematic review (see Effects on management, treatment and diagnostic classification of adding multiplex allergen testing to the diagnostic work-up of people with difficult to manage allergicdisease , above), full information on the accuracy of the diagnostic pathways is not available. Finally, information on how treatment decisions relate to the diagnostic pathways is not available. Although two studies examined changes in SIT prescriptions 32,38following the addition of multiplex allergen testing results to standard diagnostic work-up, the results of these studies were not consistent: one study38described an increase in SIT prescriptions following multiplex allergen testing, whereas the other study32described a decrease in SIT prescriptions following multiplex allergen testing (see Table 5 for more details). State-transition model To inform the long-term state-transition model, the following parameters would be required(all conditional on the test result): lprobability of allergic reactions (might be multiple allergic reactions and population specific) lprobability of remission, and lprobability of dying. No long-term consequences for multiplex allergen testing were identified in the systematic review (see Chapter 3, Overview of included studies ). Health-state utilities The evidence on utility values for allergic conditions in the UK population was limited. For food allergies,no utility values were found. For seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, EuroQol VAS scores from Pitt et al. 68 or EQ-5D scores from a European study63-65could be taken. Stephens et al.75used standard gamble to obtain utility values for atopic eczema in UK children. Only in the study by Stephens et al.75were utilities reported per degree of severity of the allergic conditions (see Tables 10 and 11). Utility values for complications of allergies, such as anaphylactic shock, could not be found in the literature, apart from the assumption made by Armstrong et al.79that the impact of anaphylactic shock on QoL was equal to zero utility for a duration of 9 days at maximum.Not at risk of allergic reaction/remission Allergic reactiona (experienced during cycle)At risk of allergic reaction FIGURE 9 Potential state-transition model structure. a, Different types and severities of allergic reactions can be separately included in the model. Death.ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk56Resource use and costs To estimate the costs of the individual tests, a detailed cost calculation (see Appendix 7 ) was performed considering test costs, capital costs (if applicable), service and maintenance costs and personnel costs for performing and interpreting the tests. The results of the detailed test cost calculation are presented in Table 12 . For ImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest testing, the minimum and maximum prices were calculated and subsequently averaged. For ImmunoCAP ISAC testing, the main differences between the minimum and maximum prices can be attributed to the difference in time (between 5 and 60 minutes) that wasneeded to interpret the test results. This also holds true for Microtest testing, although the range was smaller (between 5 and 10 minutes). Additionally, for Microtest testing it is assumed that the test sample would be sent to the Microtest DX laboratory, where the test would be performed (companies preferredand most conservative scenario), whereas for ImmunoCAP ISAC testing it is assumed that the test would be performed at the service provider laboratory. Hence, for ImmunoCAP ISAC testing capital costs are included while for Microtest testing it is assumed that these costs would be included in the test costs(see Appendix 7 ). Capital costs are annuitised using a cost discount rate of 3.5%. Additional costs that would be considered in a long-term cost (-effectiveness) analysis may include thecosts of SIT, health-state costs for being at risk of allergic reaction, and health-state costs for havingexperienced an allergic reaction. These costs are likely to be very specific for the population to be considered. Moreover, different types of SIT might be provided within a specific population (see, for example, the study by Sastre et al. 32). Hence the specific type(s) of SIT prescribed and the SIT duration would be required to calculate these costs (see, for example, the study by Meadows et al.80for a calculation of the immunotherapy costs for rhinitis). Cost analyses In this section we report on a cost comparison of three diagnostic strategies: with ImmunoCAP ISAC versus with Microtest versus the standard diagnostic pathway without multiplex allergen testing. Given that the proportion of patients receiving single IgE and OFC tests in addition to ImmunoCAP ISAC or Microtest is unclear, the cost analyses are performed using two-way threshold analysis for these parameters.90Specifically, in pairwise comparisons of two test strategies, the minimal reduction (i.e. threshold) in proportions of single IgE and OFC tests is identified that was needed for the most expensive test strategy to become cheaper than the alternative test strategy, assuming that everything else remains equal. Here, 100% for both tests was defined as all patients receiving eight single IgE tests on average and all patients receiving on average one OFC test (see Appendix 7 ). Therefore, for example, if it was assumed that the use of multiplex allergen testing would result in no single IgE testing then this would imply a 100% reduction in single IgE testing compared with the standard diagnostic pathway. Given that multiplex allergen testing is more costly than single IgE testing, threshold analysis could thenshow what percentage reduction in OFC tests would be required to give the multiplex allergen pathway the same cost as the standard diagnostic pathway. On the other hand, if it was instead assumed that there TABLE 12 Results of the test cost calculation (see Appendix 7 for more details) \u00a3 per patient tested Sources SPT 62.28 NICE 2011,86Curtis88 IgE test 136.37 NICE 2011,86Curtis88 OFC 2013-1489) ImmunoCAP ISAC 219.51 Information submitted to NICE by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Curtis88 Microtest 156.85 Information submitted to NICE by Microtest DX, Curtis88DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

As previously stated, in these analyses, it is assumed everything except the number of single IgE tests and the number of OFC tests remains equal; this includes the assumption that the proportion of patientsreceiving any SPT is equal for all test strategies. Although this assumption is debatable, it might be justifiedgiven that SPT is a simple, safe and quick test (providing results within 15- 20 minutes) that is often the first-line investigation in allergy diagnostics. Moreover, one clinician (e-mail from Paul Turner, personalcommunication), with experience with ImmunoCAP ISAC testing, indicated that all patients would receiveSPT when using ImmunoCAP ISAC. Scenario analyses Several scenario analyses were performed: 1. In the calculation of the base-case costs for ImmunoCAP ISAC it is assumed that the LuxScan 10k reader would be used only for ImmunoCAP ISAC testing (on average 386 tests per year). However, theLuxScan 10k reader might be used for other purposes. Therefore, in the first scenario analysis, it is assumed that the LuxScan 10k reader would be fully occupied for 253 days per year. This reduces the ImmunoCAP ISAC testing costs to \u00a3201.91 per patient tested. 2. The second scenario analysis considered a scenario wherein the Microtest test would be performed at the service provider laboratory instead of at the Microtest DX laboratory (as assumed in the base-caseanalysis). This scenario reduces the costs of Microtest testing to \u00a3149.37 per patient tested (seeAppendix 8 ). 3. The third scenario analysis considered the impact of the number of allergens tested using single IgE testing (base-case value =eight allergens tested per person). 86The number of allergens was set to 1 and 20, respectively. 4. The final scenario analysis considered a reduced OFC costs of \u00a3256.00, excluding the costs of implementing the food elimination diet. Threshold analyses For the situation where ImmunoCAP ISAC or Microtest are used as replacement test(s) for single IgEtesting (rather than as an add-on), a threshold analysis was performed to examine the minimum numberof allergens to be tested with single IgE tests in order for single IgE testing to be equally as expensive as, or more expensive than multiplex allergen testing, assuming that everything else remains equal. This analysis was also performed for SPT. Results of cost analyses The cost analyses consider the short-term test costs using two-way threshold analyses for the proportionof single IgE tests and the proportion of OFC tests. The base-case analysis indicated that in order forImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest to be cost-saving compared with the standard diagnostic pathway,the absolute proportion of OFC tests should be reduced by at least 15 and 4 percentage points, respectively (e.g. from 50% to 35% or from 50% to 46%, respectively), if there was a 100% reduction in single IgE tests (i.e. from 100% to 0%). On the other hand, if there is no reduction in the proportion ofsingle IgE tests (assuming an average of eight per person), the reduction in OFC tests should be at least 39% and 28% for ImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest, respectively. Moreover, ImmunoCAP ISAC compared Microtest, the proportion of OFC tests for ImmunoCAP ISAC should be reduced by at least11% if there is no reduction in the proportion of single IgE tests. When assuming no reduction in the proportion of OFC tests, the proportion of patients receiving an average of eight single IgE tests for ImmunoCAP ISAC should be reduced by at least 44% ( Figure 10 ).ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk58Scenario analyses 1. The ImmunoCAP ISAC costs are reduced by \u00a318 when assuming that the LuxScan 10k reader would be fully occupied. This resulted in a decrease in the proportions for ImmunoCAP ISAC needed to reduce in order to be cost-saving compared with the standard diagnostic pathway and Microtest (Figure 11 ). 2. The Microtest costs are reduced by \u00a37 when assuming that the Microtest test would be performed at the service provider laboratory instead of at the Microtest DX laboratory. This resulted in a decrease inthe proportions for Microtest tests needed to reduce in order to be cost-saving compared with thestandard diagnostic pathway ( Figure 12 ).020406080100 0 20 40 60 80 100 Percentage reduction in I gE testin gPercentage reduction in food challengeImmunoCAP ISAC vs. standard pathwayMicrotest vs. standard pathwayImmunoCAP ISAC vs. Microtest FIGURE 10 Results of two-way threshold analyses (base case).

Assuming that the number of allergens tested using single IgE testing is 'one' decreases the impact of reducing the proportion of patients with single IgE tests, while assuming 20 allergens tested increases the impact of reducing the proportion of patients with single IgE tests ( Figures 13 and 14). 4. Finally, decreasing the OFC costs to \u00a3256.00 substantially increases the reduction in OFC needed in order for multiplex allergen testing to be cost-saving ( Figure 15 ). Threshold analyses In these analyses, it is assumed that there is no reduction in OFC testing with multiplex testing.The minimum numbers of allergens tested using single IgE tests were 13 and 10 in order for the standardpathway to be as expensive as or more expensive than the ImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest pathways, respectively. This means that, if multiplex testing replaced single IgE testing, then it would have to replace at least 13 or 10 tests to be cost-saving.

There was some indication that the use of ImmunoCAP ISAC testing may guide decisions on the discontinuation of restrictive diets, the content of SIT prescriptions, and whether or not patients should receive SIT. However,importantly, none of the studies that we identified reported any information on clinical outcomes subsequent to changes in treatment or management based on ImmunoCAP ISAC. There was some evidence that ImmunoCAP ISAC may be useful for discriminating allergens that are structurally similar andare recognised by the same IgE antibody (cross-immunoreactive), and this may be useful for identifying thecause of food allergies. A UK-based study on the use of ImmunoCAP ISAC to investigate idiopathic anaphylaxis indicated that the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC to standard diagnostic work-up may identify a potentially causative agent in previously undiagnosed patients. 39However, it should be noted that the addition of ImmunoCAP ISAC also resulted in the identification of large numbers of sensitisations that were not considered to be associated with the anaphylaxis (i.e. large numbers of clinically false-positive test results). The diagnostic performance of ImmunoCAP ISAC in comparison with other tests (single IgE and SPT) varied considerably between studies, according to the allergens investigated and the way in which ISAC testingwas applied. In general, individual ISAC components tended to have high specificity, but low sensitivity, relative to whole-allergen single IgE tests or SPTs for the prediction of allergic response. The relatively low sensitivities of individual ISAC components are likely to be indicative of the proportions of patients inwhom each component is associated with the observed allergic response. Conversely, a high specificity isindicative of a strong association between ISAC positivity for the individual component and an allergic response to whole allergen. When ISAC was used to measure the same component as single IgE testing or to measure multiple components (homologous proteins) with a positive test defined as any componentpositive, it appeared that equivalent sensitivities could be achieved without corresponding loss of specificity. As noted above, the ability of ImmunoCAP ISAC to discriminate between allergens that are structurally similar and are recognised by the same IgE antibody (cross-immunoreactive) may representclinically useful additional information. Therefore, if the focused use of groups of ISAC components can achieve equivalent sensitivity and specificity to that of single IgE testing, ISAC testing may be preferred. The clinical effects of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people with difficult to manage allergic disease have yet to be adequately investigated; in particular, the clinical consequences of changes to diagnosis or treatment, and the frequency and relevance of clinically false-positive sensitisationshas been under investigated. Cost-effectiveness The initial aim of this assessment was to compare the cost-effectiveness of multiplex allergen testingwith current clinical practice for people with difficult to manage allergic disease in secondary or tertiary care settings. However, the lack of data on the clinical consequences of multiplex allergen testing rendered the development of a long-term economic model uninformative for health policy decision-making.Therefore, instead of developing a long-term cost-effectiveness model, this assessment aimed to inform research decisions and support future model-based economic evaluations. For this purpose, relevant cost-effectiveness analyses and available health-state utility studies were identified and reviewed. Also,the current clinical diagnostic pathway, as well as the potential place for multiplex allergen testing, wereDOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Finally, a survey was performed to retrieve the number of patients receiving each test, test costs were calculated and cost analyses were performed to examine the short-term costs of the test strategies. All four identified cost-effectiveness studies33,34,54-60(all abstracts) showed an increased effectiveness when using ImmunoCAP ISAC and three54-60out of four studies also showed cost savings when using ImmunoCAP ISAC. However, the methods and assumptions used in these assessments are largely unclear, severely hampering the assessment of the validity of the results. In addition, the credibility of these assessments was questioned as fundamental inputs of their models were based on expert opinion or inaccessible references, or no references were provided. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted with extreme caution. The evidence on utility values for allergic conditions in the UK population was limited. For food allergies no utility values were found, whereas UK utility values were available for seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitisand atopic eczema in children. Test costs for ImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest were estimated to be \u00a3219.51 and \u00a3156.85, respectively. For SPT, single IgE and the food challenge test these were \u00a362.29, \u00a3136.37 and \u00a3570.00, respectively. Detailedcost analyses were performed to estimate the short-term cost of diagnostic pathways with and without multiplex allergen testing. As the place of multiplex allergen testing in the diagnostic pathway and the proportions of patients receiving a particular test are unclear, and the survey did not provide the requiredresults, different scenario and threshold analyses were performed. The results of these analyses depend on precisely the effect of multiplex testing on the need for single IgE, SPT and OFC testing. For example, if multiplex testing replaced single IgE testing (assuming eight tests per person) then a 15% or 4% reduction inOFC would be required for ImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest, respectively, to be cost-saving. However, if there was no reduction in OFC testing, then the number of single IgE tests or SPTs per patient that needed replacing would have to be at least 39% or 28% for ImmunoCAP ISAC and Microtest, respectively, to be cost-saving. Strengths and limitations of assessment Clinical effectiveness Extensive literature searches were conducted in an attempt to maximise retrieval of relevant studies.These included electronic searches of a variety of bibliographic databases, as well as screening of clinicaltrials registers and conference abstracts to identify unpublished studies. Despite this, we were unable to identify any studies that reported clinical outcomes and available data were generally very sparse. The possibility of publication bias cannot be ruled out. Owing to the small number of included studies and between-study clinical heterogeneity, we were unable to perform any meta-analyses or to undertake a formal assessment of publication bias. However, our search strategy included a variety of routes to identifyunpublished studies and resulted in the inclusion of a number of conference abstracts. Clear inclusion criteria were specified in the registered protocol for this review (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42015019739). One change was made to the published protocol, expanding the inclusion criteria toallow inclusion of studies that reported direct comparisons of diagnostic accuracy between single IgE testing and multiplex allergen testing, using SPTs or allergen challenge tests as the reference standard, but did not report details of any participants for whom multiplex allergen testing provided additional information(details provided in Chapter 3 ; see Inclusion and exclusion criteria). These studies were included with the aim of providing some indication of the performance of multiplex allergen testing, compared with currentsingle IgE antibody testing practice, for predicting clinical response; studies that reported only the accuracyof multiplex allergen testing, without a comparison to current testing practice, were therefore not included. In addition, we have provided specific reasons for exclusion for all of the studies that were considered potentially relevant at initial citation screening and were subsequently excluded on assessment of the fullpublication (see Appendix 3 ). The eligibility of studies for inclusion is therefore transparent.DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk64The review process followed recommended methods to minimise the potential for error and/or bias;21 studies were independently screened for inclusion by two reviewers, and data extraction and quality assessment were done by one reviewer and checked by a second (MW and SL). Any disagreements wereresolved by consensus. Studies included in this review were assessed for risk of bias, where possible using published validated tools [the QUADAS-2 tool 25and CASP cohort risk-of-bias tool (www.casp-uk.net/)]. The review included a number of observational studies, which used a 'before-and-after 'type study design to assess the effects of adding information from multiplex allergen testing to the standard diagnostic work-up in the same groupof participants. We are not aware of any published risk-of-bias tool that is appropriate for the assessmentof this type of study. A review-specific tool was therefore designed by the authors (MW, SL and NA) to allow the methodological quality of these studies to be systematically assessed and described. This tool focuses on elements of study design that we considered relevant to this specific study type, and isbased upon the structure of the QUADAS-2 tool. The results of the risk-of-bias assessment are reported, in full, for all included studies in Appendix 4 and are summarised in Chapter 3 (see Study quality ). Studies were generally of unclear quality due to limitations in reporting, with full publications lacking for many studies (reported as conference abstracts only). None of the studies included in this review can beconsidered to have low risk of bias; all studies were rated as 'high 'or'unclear 'risk of bias on at least one domain of the relevant tool. The main 'high 'risk-of-bias areas identified were participant selection (inappropriate exclusions) and application of testing procedures (variation in testing procedures betweenstudy participants and within-study optimisation of the diagnostic threshold). An important potential advantage of ImmunoCAP ISAC and other multicomponent arrays is their ability to differentiate between allergens that have similar structures; these homologous allergens maybe recognised by the same antibody (cross-reactivity) or homologous allergens may cause the same allergic response (cross-sensitisation). For example, a blood sample that shows immunoreactivity to Bet v1 may indicate thata patient is sensitised to birch pollen or they may be sensitised to one of many protein homologues (proteins of similar molecular structure to Bet v1), or they may be sensitised to both. Bet v1 is a PR10 protein that has several homologues or protein family members. On the ISAC 112 chip there are nine (hazel). ISAC 112 has the potential to discriminate between immunoreactivity to Bet v1 and nine homologues, a process that would take much longer by single allergen (single IgE) testing. According to the ImmunoCAP ISAC 112technical brochure 91there are seven other protein families represented on the chip; therefore, its potential to provide information regarding cross-immunoreactivity of homologous proteins is apparent. However,data showing the effects of providing additional information of this type were very limited. It is importantto note that ISAC multiplex testing on its own can differentiate between the immunoreactivity of a given allergen and a homologue only if that homologue is present on the array chip. Several reports raised the fact that not all useful components were present on the array. 37,39,40These reports were carried out on earlier versions of ISAC and some of the suggested components now appear on ISAC 112. Further research maybe needed to target specific conditions and interpretation of data should always bear in mind what components are not on the array as well as what components are on the array. Predominantly, the accuracy studies included in this review compared the performance of whole allergens (single IgE) to the ability of allergen components (ImmunoCAP ISAC) to detect specific IgE. Although both are aiming to identify the presence of specific antibodies in a patient serum sample, this is more likely tooccur if using the whole allergen than part of the allergen. Classically, the interaction between an antibody and an antigen (allergen) occurs through very specific binding sites on both molecules. Therefore, the selected allergen component(s) may or may not contain this binding site. Furthermore, multiple antibodiesmay have been produced to one allergen each using different binding sites. The use of whole allergens is likely to give very different results to using a component and this may explain some of the discrepancies seen between the accuracy studies.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Only one study compared the ability of the same component (rGLy m4) to detect specific antibodies using single IgE testing and ImmunoCAP ISAC. Interestingly, the two methods reported different sensitivities and specificities, indicating that theyperform differently. This was not unexpected as the performance of the single IgE test will be maximised to give the best result for the single allergen of interest, whereas ImmunoCAP ISAC is developed to give the best results for a range of allergens. Therefore, the effect of non-specific binding within these twosystems on diagnostic accuracy is unknown. Studies often included patients with a clinical history of an immediate reaction to an allergen, indicating that these patients were likely to have had an IgE-mediated event, and excluded patients with delayedreactions possibly caused by mechanisms other than IgE. This must be borne in mind when evaluating the clinical performance of tests based on single IgE measurement, in that the research populations may be unrepresentative of those for whom the test would be used in practice. Nevertheless, it is expected thatthese tests will be used only on patients who are strongly suspected of an IgE-mediated reaction. Finally, the studies included in this systematic review may have limited applicability to the specified population of interest (people with complex or difficult to manage allergies who are being assessed in UKsecondary or tertiary health-care settings). Studies that did not specify that they included participants with difficult to manage allergic disease, or described inclusion criteria that could be considered consistent with this classification (e.g. polysensitised patients), were classified as having 'high 'concerns regarding applicability. Studies that were conducted in non-UK settings and which assessed allergens considered unlikely to be relevant to UK populations (e.g. aeroallergens associated with Mediterranean countries) were also classified as having 'high 'concerns regarding applicability. Only two 39,40of the studies included in the review were rated as having 'low'concerns with respect to both of these issues. None of the comparative accuracy studies was conducted in populations likely to be representative of peoplewith difficult to manage allergic disease and two 43,45of these studies explicitly excluded people with complex allergies. The studies identified by our systematic review did not provide sufficient evidence to adequately assess the clinical effectiveness of adding multiplex allergen testing to the investigation of people with difficult tomanage allergic disease, in secondary or tertiary UK health-care settings. However, we believe that our comprehensive assessment of the limited available evidence has highlighted key areas in which data are lacking and provides a useful framework to guide the development of research recommendations. Cost-effectiveness This is the first time that a model structure including diagnostic pathways has been attempted to examinethe place of multiplex testing in the UK. Our cost analysis is also the first to assess the short-term costs of multiplex allergen testing in the UK. For this purpose a detailed cost analysis was performed, and multiple scenario and threshold analyses were conducted. Extensive literature searches were conducted to providean overview of available cost-effectiveness analyses and available health-state utilities. Additional searching in terms of reference checking and extensive hand searching was performed to maximise retrieval of relevant studies (including conference abstracts). Clear inclusion criteria were specified for selectingrelevant studies. Relevant papers were summarised and the quality of cost-effectiveness analyses wasassessed. Authors were contacted to provide more details if needed. The main limitations of this assessment are the lack of information of the place of multiplex testing in the care pathway and any effectiveness evidence. There is therefore an inability to incorporate long-term costs and consequences (i.e. life-years and QALYs), particularly long-term outcomes conditional on the short-term test outcomes. As illustrated by previous assessments for the UK, 80,82it is possible to estimate long-term outcomes for treatments of allergic conditions (not conditional on a test result). Nevertheless, these assessments had severe limitations including that they required extensive assumptions (including mapping of utility values).80DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk66Uncertainties Clinical effectiveness The potential role of multiplex allergen testing in the care pathway of patients with complex allergic disease remains unclear. As described in the objectives for this assessment, multiplex allergen testing could be added to existing standard diagnostic work-up or could be used to replace some or all of the single IgEtests that would otherwise be used in some patients. In order to adequately assess the effectiveness of multiplex allergen testing as an add-on test, studies would be required that compare the management of patients based on standard diagnostic work-up tomanagement based on standard diagnostic work-up with the addition of multiplex allergen testing and which provide information on subsequent clinical outcomes. Although it might be suggested that RCTs represent the 'gold standard 'for this comparison, other study designs may provide relevant information. In particular, earlier stage, exploratory studies can be important in determining whether RCTs or other large-scale comparative studies are justified and in informing the design of such studies. The seven 'diagnostic before-and-after 'studies included in this assessment show participating clinicians changing various aspects of their judgement about a given group of patients when they have access to the results ofImmunoCAP ISAC testing. The findings of these studies indicate that multiplex allergen testing may provide information, additional to that obtained from standard diagnostic work-up, which can affect clinicians 'decision-making. However, the studies did not clearly report the extent to which the changes in clinicians 'judgement resulted in implementation of changes to the care of patients. Further, if additional information provided by multiplex allergen testing results in changes to the care of patients, it is importantto collect information on subsequent clinical outcomes and to compare these outcomes with those seen inpatients whose care has been based on standard diagnostic work-up. Such comparisons are necessary to assess whether care decisions based on information that included the results of multiplex allergen testing ultimately result in benefit or detriment to patients, or have no significant effect. One study indicated that ImmunoCAP ISAC should be used before single IgE testing. This relates to the ability of the microarray to analyse 56 allergens and provide data to help identify allergens that arecross-sensitive or those that are cross-immunoreactive. This has been applied to complex food allergy,for which ImmunoCAP ISAC can help determine to which food allergens a patient is sensitised; in particular, it is able to determine which homologous allergens give rise to the sensitivity observed in a single IgE test. When several food allergens are suspected ImmunoCAP ISAC testing can allow the clinicianto quickly determine and reduce the number of confirmatory oral challenges required. In the absence of information on clinical outcomes, it may therefore be useful to obtain information on how the addition of multiple allergen testing to the standard diagnostic work-up of people with difficult to manage allergicdisease affects the overall testing burden (e.g. the number of single IgE tests and/or confirmatory challenge tests used) or other resource-use outcomes (e.g. the number of subsequent consultations with health-care professionals). We did not identify any studies that reported resource-use outcomes. This assessment also includes eight studies that report information on the accuracy of various components and combinations of components on the ImmunoCAP ISAC chip compared with the accuracy of othertesting options (single IgE or SPT) to predict allergic response (as defined by SPT or OFC). Studies of thistype can determine whether multiplex allergen testing provides similar diagnostic information to that provided by single IgE or other testing options, when used in the same group of patients; comparable performance may be considered indicative of the potential of multiplex allergen testing to replace othertests without significant adverse diagnostic consequences (missed diagnoses or false positives). However, none of the comparative accuracy studies identified was conducted in populations with difficult to manage allergic disease. Studies therefore evaluated the diagnostic performance of single components or smallgroups of components on the ImmunoCAP ISAC chip that were relevant to the investigation of specific allergies (e.g. Gal d1, Gal d2 and Gal d3 for hen' s egg allergy). The focused use of the ImmunoCAP ISAC chip is likely to result in low numbers of false positives and high specificity estimates (i.e. sensitisations detected are likely to be associated with observed allergic response). These studies have limitedDOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

If multiplex allergen testing is applied in this way, it might beexpected that greater numbers of false positives would be generated (i.e. more sensitisations that are not associated with observed allergic response would be identified). Some evidence of this can be seen from the results of Heaps 2014, 39described in Chapter 3 (see Effects on management, treatment and diagnostic classification of adding multiplex allergen testing to the diagnostic work-up of people with difficult tomanage allergic disease ), which, as well as identifying sensitisations thought to be associated with anaphylaxis in some patients, identified large numbers of sensitisations that were not considered to beclinically relevant. In addition, two studies 92,93that did not meet the inclusion criteria of this systematic review reported data comparing rates of sensitisation to various allergen groups relevant to plant-food allergy in allergic and tolerant individuals. Both studies were conducted in Spain. The first study included 123 children with food allergy, of whom 55 were classified as peanut allergic and 68 as peanut tolerant(SPT and single IgE) and used ImmunoCAP ISAC 103 to assess sensitisation to a range of allergenic components. 92There were no significant differences between peanut-allergic and peanut-tolerant children in the rates of sensitisation to pathogenesis-related protein family PR-10 allergens (Ara h8, Act Cor Gly Pru p1), profilins v2, Ole e2, b8, a1, pollens (Ole e1, Phl p1). 92 The second study included 130 children with plant-food allergy and LTP sensitisation and found thatsensitisation to a particular plant-food LTP, as determined by ImmunoCAP ISAC 112, was not alwaysassociated with clinical symptoms of allergy to that plant food: 69% (40/58) and 63% (17/27) r3, 60% (21/35) of children without seed/nut allergy to storage proteins. 93The potential of multiplex allergen testing to detect clinically false-positive sensitisations has not yet been adequately investigated and the long-term relevance of such sensitisations is unknown. However, the limited available data indicate a need for care in the application and interpretation of multiplex allergen testing. Finally, we did not identify any studies of multiplex allergen testing using Microtest that met the inclusion criteria for this assessment. The manufacturer provided unpublished data on the concordance between testmethods (Microtest, ImmunoCAP single IgE, ImmunoCAP These are summarised inAppendix 5 , for information only. Cost-effectiveness The credibility of available cost-effectiveness studies in the literature can be questioned given the use of expert opinion for fundamental model inputs. Moreover, (UK) health-state utility values for allergic conditions are scarce (e.g. utilities for food allergy and for test AEs are lacking). However, the main sourceof uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of multiplex allergen testing compared with current clinical practice for people with difficult to manage allergic disease was the lack of data on long-term clinical consequences conditional on test results of a diagnostic pathway including multiplex allergen testing. The place of multiplex allergen testing in the diagnostic pathway and the proportions of patients receiving a particular test was unclear (for both the current diagnostic pathway and the diagnostic pathway includingmultiplex allergen testing). Therefore, speculative two-way threshold analyses were performed in thisassessment to consider the diagnostic pathway costs only. These analyses required assumptions regarding all key parameters relating to the pathway, including the proportions/numbers per patient of single IgE and OFC tests and SPT. For example, it does seem likely that multiplex testing, by ruling out some allergens,might avoid confirmatory testing with OFC or SPT. However, SPT is a simple, safe and quick test (providing results within 15 -20 minutes) and it is often the first-line investigation in allergy. In addition, one clinician (e-mail from Paul Turner, personal communication), with experience with ImmunoCAP ISAC testing, indicated that all patients would receive SPT when using ImmunoCAP ISAC. Hence, it might be that multiplex allergen testing would not reduce the number of SPT. Finally, whether single IgE might be used as an add-on to multiplex allergen testing or would be replaced by multiplex testing remains uncertain,particularly given the limited experience with multiplex allergen testing in the UK.DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk68Chapter 6 Conclusions Implications for service provision No recommendations for service provision can be made based on the analyses included in this report. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using multiplex allergen testing in the investigation of people with difficult to manage allergic disease have yet to be adequately investigated. In particular, theclinical consequences of changes to diagnosis or treatment and the frequency and relevance of clinically false-positive sensitisations have been under investigated. From the limited evidence available it appears that the most likely role of multiplex allergen testing would be to replace some or all single IgE testing.The ability of multiplex testing to simultaneously identify multiple antibodies in the serum samples, combined with its ability to identify which homologous allergens are cross-immunoreactive, means that these tests have the potential to provide a lot of information in a single step. Although confirmatorytesting (SPT or OFC) is still likely to be required, multiplex testing could be used to tailor confirmatorytesting to the individual patient and thus reduce the overall testing burden; no studies were identified that assessed overall testing burden. It should be noted that all of the evidence identified related to one test (ImmunoCAP ISAC) and conclusions on the potential utility of multiplex allergen testing may not begeneralisible to other products. Suggested research priorities There remains considerable uncertainty about the possible role of multiplex allergen testing inthe investigation of people with difficult to manage allergic disease in the UK. The formulation of a consensus-based protocol for the use of multiplex allergen testing may represent a useful starting point for future research. A prospective study would then be needed to investigate the clinical effectiveness ofthe proposed protocol. The preferred design would be a RCT comparing diagnostic pathways with andwithout multiplex allergen testing. Alternatively, an observational study to compare outcomes in centres using multiplex allergen testing to those using diagnostic pathways without multiplex allergen testing may also be a useful approach. Such an approach would, however, require careful consideration ofbetween-centre differences in patient care pathways (other than the use of multiplex allergen testing). Outcomes measured could include: lShort-term outcomes: \u00a2diagnostic performance, including discrimination between allergens responsible for allergic reactions and those that are cross-immunoreactive, and false-positive rate (i.e. the number of sensitisations identified that are not associated with allergic response) when the full panels of multiplex allergen testing devices are used in people with difficult to manage allergic disease \u00a2treatments or management decisions (including type and duration and the use and extent ofrestriction diets) \u00a2overall testing burden (i.e. the total number of including multiplex allergen testing,single IgE testing, SPTs and OFC tests, required to reach a diagnosis and formulate atreatment/management plan) \u00a2any AEs associated with testing.DOI: 10.3310/hta20670 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 67 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.
