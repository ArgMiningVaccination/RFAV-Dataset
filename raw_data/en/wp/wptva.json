Brief Site History Discussion of Cleanup Alternatives DHEC's Preferred Cleanup Alternative 7Public Comment Period: September 8, 2022 to October 10, 2022Proposed Plan DHEC has completed an evaluation of cleanup alternatives presented in the Feasibility Study to address contamination at the site. The Proposed Plan identifies DHEC's Preferred Clean -up Alternative and the reasoning for this preference. The Proposed Plan includes summaries of all cleanup alternatives that were evaluated. 8Purpose of the Proposed Plan Inform everyone of activities at the Site Gain public input and comments Fulfill the requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) 9Public Comment Period Public Comment period: September 8, 2022 to October 10, 2022 DHEC will select the final cleanup remedy after reviewing and considering comments. DHEC may modify the Preferred Alternative or select another response action based on new information or public comments. Public encouraged to review and comment on all the Alternatives presented. 1011 Former Vermont Bosch Site Location 800 Woodside Avenue Fountain Inn, SCSite Ownership History 1985 -Began operations as Rosco Tools, a division of Vermont American Corporation. 1989- Vermont American Corporation is purchased by Bosch Group and Emerson Electric. 2001- Bosch buys out Emerson stake in Vermont American Corporation and forms Robert Bosch Tools. 2005- Sold to Fountain Inn Investments LLC 2008 -Purchased by Stevens Andrew E Trustee 2012 -Purchased by Wirthwein Real Estate LLC and operated by South Carolina Plastics LLC 12Contaminants 13History of Assessment and Remediation Various phases of assessment for soil and groundwater.1996 -2005 Vermont Bosch entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Contract with the Department.2005 Remedial Investigation (RI) included soil assessment and installation of groundwater monitoring wells. And site wide groundwater sampling event.2016 -2018 Feasibility Study and revisions.2020 13Area of Concern Former Hazardous Waste Accumulation Building located southwest of the facility building is the main area of concern. The Building contained various hazardous and non-hazardous wastes such as chlorinated solvents, paints, inks, thinners, and plasticizers. PCE was detected in groundwater and soil at this location. PCE concentrations in groundwater significantly exceed MCLs. 1516 Shallow Groundwater Contamination17 Intermediate and Deep Groundwater ContaminationSurface Water ContaminationCleanup Goals Prevent leaching of soil contamination to groundwater. Prevent exposure of human receptors to contaminated groundwater. Restore groundwater to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) MCLs. Mitigate further migration of groundwater contamination to surface water. 1920Clean Up Alternatives Alternative 1 No Action Alternative 2 Soil Vapor Extraction and Air Sparging with In -Situ Chemical Reduction using Zero Valent Iron Alternative 3 In-Situ Chemical Oxidation Blending and In -Situ Chemical Reduction using Zero Valent Iron Alternative 4 Soil Excavation, In -Situ Chemical Oxidation Blending and In -Situ Chemical Reduction using Zero Valent IronAlternative 1: No Action Required by the National Contingency Plan (baseline comparison to other alternatives) No active treatment No monitoring Cost $0 21Alternative 2: Soil Vapor Extraction and Air Sparging with In -Situ Chemical Reduction using Zero Valent Iron Soil vapor extraction for soil contamination Air sparge wells for groundwater and saturated soil contamination In-situ chemical reduction using zero valent iron for groundwater contamination remediation Cost $611,000 22Alternative 3: In -Situ Chemical Oxidation Blending and In- Situ Chemical Reduction using Zero Valent Iron In-situ chemical oxidation of vadose zone soil for shallow and deeper treatment zones Stabilization of treatment zones using Portland cement In-situ chemical reduction using zero valent iron for groundwater contamination Costs $489,500 23Alternative 4: Soil Excavation with In -Situ Chemical Oxidation and In -Situ Chemical Reduction using Zero Valent Iron Concrete slab removal and soil excavation In-situ chemical oxidation soil blending using potassium permanganate In-situ chemical reduction using zero valent iron for groundwater remediation Costs $539,000 24Evaluation Criteria 1.Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment; 2.Compliance with State & Federal Regulations; 3.Long -Term Effectiveness and Permanence; 4.Reduction of toxicity, through Effectiveness; 6.Implementability; 7.Cost; and 8.Community Acceptance 25Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment Alternative 1 (No Action) does not achieve the remedial action objective. Alternative 2 , 3 and 4 include treatment of soil and groundwater and/or elimination of source material using various technologies. Alternatives 2 -4 protect human health and the environment at a similar level. 26Compliance with State and Federal Regulations Alternatives 1 does not meet regulatory limits. Alternatives 2, 3 and 4 would comply with regulatory limits within various time frames. Alternative 2 may require additional permitting or monitoring for the air sparging system. 27Long Term Effectiveness and Permanence Alternative 1 does not provide long term effectiveness and permanence. Alternatives 2 through 4 use various technologies to treat source area contaminated soil that would leach to groundwater. Alternatives 2 through 4 treat contaminated groundwater migrating to the unnamed tributary. 28Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, or Volume Through Treatment Alternative 1 does not result in a reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume of contamination. Alternatives 2, 3 and 4 reduce toxicity and mobility of contamination using similar techniques in addition to preventing future discharge of contamination to the unnamed tributary. 29Short -Term Effectiveness Alternative 1 does not include any actions which might create increased risk to the community, workers, or the environment. Alternatives 2 and 3 use similar technologies to treat soil and groundwater contamination. The SVE/AS treatment system and ZVI materials may provide exposure to workers during system installation. Alternative 4 includes excavation and disposal of contaminated soil which may potentially expose workers to contaminants during construction and transport activities. Oxidant and ZVI material injections may also provide exposure to workers. 30Implementability Alternative 1 does not involve construction, operation, or maintenance of a remedial system. Alternatives 2 through 4 require injection of amendments and excavation/disposal, all of which have been successfully used to remediate similar sites in similar geologic settings. 31The table below ranks the alternatives from 1- 6 based off their effectiveness for each category. The remedy with the highest total score is considered the best alternative for each media.

Soil from 0 to 10 feet below ground surface removed and stockpiled. ISCO soil blending with potassium permanganate within the 10 ft to 25 ft treatment zone followed by stabilization with 5% Portland cement. ISCO soil blending with potassium permanganate within the 0 to 10 ft zone followed by stabilization. ZVI injected into borings installed in rows perpendicular to the groundwater contaminant plume. 33Alternative 3 In-situ Chemical Oxidation Soil Blending and In -situ Chemical Reduction with Zero Valent Iron 34 Next Steps Operation & MaintenanceRemedial ActionRemedial DesignRemedy SelectionRemedial Investigation & Feasibility StudyVermont Bosch voluntarily agrees to conduct Remedial Investigation & Feasibility Study (RI/FS) Proposed PlanRecord of Decision Public Comment Period -Evaluates Community Acceptance of DHEC's Preferred Alternative.
