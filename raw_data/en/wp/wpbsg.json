They can be easily adapted to include local resources. The document can be used for training or as a helpful reminder for more experienced medicines information staff. For all enquiries you need to know: 1. The enquirer. 2. Contact details. 3. Urgency of enquiry. 4. Purpose of enquiry e.g. patient specific, project. 5. What sources already been used ( NOTE : Try to assess enquirer's experience of searching more complicated resources as you may feel you need to do extra research). Each monograph is divided into the following sections: 1. Background information - pointers to information that may be required. 2. Resources. a. First-line resources, including: i. In-house past enquiries. Use your judgement to decide if an enquiry is too old to be relevant. For suggested keywords to search for, see the end of each monograph. ii. UKMi Medicines Q&As Look for these early in your search; a relevant Q&A can save you a lot of work. b. Local resources e.g. contact details of experts, relevant departments, and policies. 3. Answering the enquiry - useful pointers to factors that should be considered. 4. Keyword suggestions for future enquiry retrieval. Essential resource list These guidelines should be used in conjunction with the UKMi Essential Resources list . This lists resources for purchase and resources with free access for NHS Medicines Information Services .

Are there any restrictions on the choice of administration route? For example, patients with diarrhoea may not be able to use rectal preparations. Patients with burns, eczema, excess hair or very sensitive skin conditions may not be able to use transdermal preparations. Patients with low muscle mass will not be able to have intramuscular injections. Patients with increased bleeding risk will not be able to have subcutaneous or intramuscular injections. What other routes are available? For example, does the patient have a venflon inserted; do they have an enteral feeding tube in situ? Is a subcutaneous pump being used? Nil-by-mouth (NBM) prior to surgery: What medicines and doses is the patient taking and what are the indications ? Can any be suspended temporarily? How long is the patient likely to be NBM? Have any other formulations been considered? What type of surgery is the patient about to undergo? Ocular administration: If the question is about order or administration of eye drops - what are the names and doses of each ? Are the drops to go into one or both eyes? What is the dosage frequency? If the question is about number of bottles of eye drops to dispense - how long will the patient be using the eye drops for? Nebulised administration: What medicines are to be nebulised? Is the medicine licensed for nebulised administration? If not, is t here an alternate drug which is licensed for administration via this route? If nebulised administration is off -label, what excipients are in the preparation? What are the doses and frequency of administration? What type of nebuliser is being used? Swallo wing difficulties: How does the patient eat and drink? Can they safely swallow water or do they need thickened fluids or modified food textures? (Patients who cannot safely swallow food and drink need a swallow assessment by a Speech and Language therapist. Patients who cannot safely swallow water will not be able to safely swallow liquid medicines and will need to take crushed tablets/ opened capsules with food of the appropriate consistency). Is the patient's ability to swallow expected to improv e (e.g. after throat surgery)? If so, when is this likely? What medicines are they prescribed (drugs and formulations)? Are they able to take any of them? If so, which ones? Who prepares and gives the patient their medicines? Would they have the manual dexterity or be able to follow instructions to crush tablet or open capsules?

What is the current and previous medical history if relevant, including risk factors for the ADR? Is there a history of adverse drug reactions or allergies? List current drug therapy, including non- prescription medicines, alternative therapies and drugs of abuse whenever possible, plus any medication taken within the last 3 months. What is the timing of the reaction in relation to start or dose increase of the suspected drug? Obtain a full description of the signs and symptoms of the reaction; clarify reactions such as 'rash', 'abnormal liver function tests (LFTs)', 'aching all over'. Has the suspected drug been stopped? How has the patient been managed so far? Has rechallenge, deliberate or inadvertent, been undertaken? Did the suspec ted ADR resolve when the suspect drug was stopped? What are the results of any relevant biochemical tests e.g. renal function tests, liver function tests, full blood count, biopsies, relevant ultrasound or screening tests. Does the enquirer want to know which drug, A or B, is more likely to have caused side effect X? Is the enquirer involved in a legal case? Always be aware that this may be the scenario (often enquirers do not mention this). Has the manufacturer been informed or a yellow card completed? Prospective enquiries Does the enquirer think that the patient may be at particular risk of an ADR e.g. a patient with a history of an ADR to the same class of drugs? If so, what were the signs and symptoms of the suspected previous reaction? NOTE: caution may be required when using other drugs with similar ADR profiles. Does the enquirer just want general information e.g. for informing a patient of possible side effects? Does the enquirer want to know more information about a specific side effect e.g. because the patient has asked? Does the enquirer want to assess the risk/benefit comparison between two drugs e.g. which is safer, drug A or drug B (often in relation to a specific side- effect)? Some enquiries will involve a mixture of the two e.g. if a pati ent has a reaction which is subsequently thought to be an ADR then it could be anticipated that the enquirer will want suggestions for alternatives.

Previous SPC or literature reports describing the reaction. The timing of the reaction can vary but most ADRs appear shortly after a drug is started or the dose is increased. Outcome on drug withdrawal, if resolution occurs this is a positive dechallenge.

Risk factors, some patients have an increased susceptibility to ADRs (e.g. children, elderly, multiple disease states, atopic patients). Laboratory and diagnostic tests should indicate if there is a non- drug cause, ADRs are often a diagnosis of exclusion. When interpreting ADR data for the enquirer, be clear about the limitations of the Yellow Card data. Warn that although there may be X number of reports we do not know the Y number of people who have received the drug, therefore you cannot extrapolate to predict ADR incidence. Reporting suspected ADRs If you suspect that an ADR has been identified please complete a Yellow Card or offer to help your enquirer complete a card.

Has she been told to withhold until confirmation is received that it is okay to breastfeed? Is she still pregnant and thinking about breastfeeding in the future? Infant How old is the infant? Was he/she premature or full -term? What is the infant's weight? Is the infant fed exclusively with breast milk? Babies are weaned onto solid foods at around six months of age. Before this age, it is recommended that children are exclusively breast fed. Exposure to drugs in breast milk is greatest for babies who are exclusively breastfed. Is the infant well? Is there anything to suggest that the infant may be at increased risk of drug harm, e.g. impaired kidney or liver function? Has the infant been prescribed any medicines Medicines- related: Medicine - the proposed medicine(s) and any other medicines the mother is taking (generic or brand name), dose, frequency, route and intended duration of treatment. Indication - The risk vs. benefit decision may differ depending on the indications e.g. an antiepileptic medi cine for control of epilepsy compared to its use for neuropathic pain. Is the mother already taking the medicine in question? Is this drug therapy necessary? Have other therapies/medicines been considered or tried? Has the mother taken the drug during pr egnancy? If so, identify whether it is appropriate to switch to an alternative if necessary. Note exposure during pregnancy does not confer safety during breastfeeding.

The benefits of breastfeeding must be recognised; a recommendation to stop breastfeeding must not be made lightly. If the mother must withhold breastfeedin g, think of the practicalities for both her and the infant. The mother will need to express the milk and discard it; the infant may need to take formula milk. In households where the infant is exclusively breastfed, there may not be bottles/teats readily available. The benefit and risk to both mother and infant must be considered. Neonates and premature infants are at greater risk from exposure to drugs via breast milk, because of immature excretory functions and the consequent risk of drug accumulation. Infants exposed to drugs via breast milk should be monitored for unusual signs or symptoms. Avoid unnecessary drug use and limit use of over -the-counter (OTC) products. Avoid use of drugs known to cause serious toxicity in adults or children. Drugs licensed for use in infants do not generally pose a hazard to full -term, healthy infants. Choose a regimen and route of administration which presents the minimum amount of drug to the infant. Be more cautious about recommending medicines with long half -lives, since these are more likely to cause adverse effects. Multiple drug regimens may pose an increased risk especially when adverse effects such as drowsiness are additive. Avoid new drugs if a therapeutically equivalent alternative with more safety data is available.

Find out if this has been done. For enquiries about managing a specific patient (other than straightforward medicines inf ormation queries), advise the enquirer to contact this nurse. Mixing two or more licensed drugs for administration via a syringe driver, where one is not a vehicle for administering the other, falls within the definition of manufacture and results in a new , unlicensed product. The person undertaking this preparation, unles s an exemption applies ( doctors , dentists , nurse and pharmacist independent supplementary prescribers ), must hold a manufacturer's licence. The exemption allows these prescribers to mix medicines themselves or direct others to mix. Directions must be in writing. Some drugs are too irritant to be given subcutaneously, e.g. prochlorperazine, diazepam and chlorpromazine. Phenobarbital is incompatible with mos t drugs given by continuous subcutaneous infusion and it is generally advisable to give via a separate syringe driver. If dexamethasone is to be mixed with other drugs, use as much diluent as possible before adding dexamethasone. Using more than one syring e driver may be an option if there are compatibility problems and alternative routes are unsuitable.

Confirm maximum volume of the syringe driver. There may be limitations on concentrations that mean more than one daily syringe driver change is needed. Check whether this is going to be practical. Remember that a medicine with a long half -life might not need to go in the syringe driver, and c ould potentially be given as a once or twice daily subcutaneous injection (e.g. dexamethasone, haloperidol , levomepromzaine).

Local resources Answering the enquiry Ensure that the enquirer is aware of the lack of quality, reliable information in the literature regarding complementary medicines. There is also an abundance of misleading information which is usually what patients have access to! This is particularly true of internet based resources. When assessing the quality of a website it is useful to ask yourself the following questions: o Is the information up- to-date? o Who has written the information? o Who 'owns' the website? Could there be a conflict of interest? o Are claims supported by reliable evidence? o Is any information provided about risks associated with treatments? Consider any comorbidities the patient may have and use caution when advising for patients who may be predisposed to suffering an adverse event, e.g. older patients and children. Consider any acute risks the patient may be exposed to, for example, surgical patients may be at increased risk of suffering a bleed. UKMi Qual ity and Risk Management Group MEDICINES INFORMATION ENQUIRY ANSWERING GUIDELINES Version: 1. 2 Date of Preparation: October 2020 Date for Review: October 2022 Resources updated February 2022 Page 28 of 119 Overall there is limited information available regarding interactions between complementary/alternative medicines and conventional medicines. Occasionally herbal products may be contaminated with other active substances. As with conventional drug interactions, herb- drug interactions may be pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic. It is often difficult to assess whether a complementary medicine will interact with a conventional medicine. In this situation it may be prudent to advise against using them together. In most cases this is not because there is evidence of an interaction but because there is a lack of evidence to assess risk. Individuals using a complementary medicine should be advised to be consistent with the brand, dose and frequency of administration of the product being used. Enquirers often ask about the likelihood of an inter action between prescribed and complementary medicines. Some herbal products may compromise the efficacy of conventional medicines and there are particular concerns for those individuals receiving drugs with a narrow therapeutic window such as warfarin, ph enytoin and digoxin. Ideally where there is limited safety data for a particular herbal preparation it would be prudent to avoid their use in patients receiving these types of medicines or in those whose therapy is deemed critical e.g. chemotherapy. Pregnancy and breastfeeding - there is very limited information on the use of alternative or complementary medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding and should only be recommended after careful consideration of the risks and benefits. Some preparations will be contraindicated in pregnancy - always consult a specialist source.

Local resources Nearest hospital with a liver unit For a practical approach to managing patients with hepatic disease, contact the pharmacy department of your nearest liver unit. Answering the enquiry The following factors should be considered when deciding on an optimum drug treatment for a patient with liver disease: o Type, extent and severity of liver disease o Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug o Adverse reactions of the drug o Patient specific factors e.g. age, comorbidities, severity of the condition being treated, concomitant medications o In patients with hepatic dysfunction, avoid hepatotoxic drugs where possible. Patients with existing hepatic disease may not necessarily be more prone to hepatotoxicity (unless it is dose- related), but they have diminished reserve hepatic function and may suffer disproportionately if hepatotoxicity does occur. Drug hepatotoxicity on top of existing liver disease and even clinically insignificant and/or transient changes in LFTs may confuse the diagnostic picture. o For drugs metabolised by the liver, be alert to signs of drug side effects, know what they are and monitor for them. Monitor drug levels where appropriate. o Non- systemic treatments should be chosen where possible. Renally excreted drugs are also preferred as long as renal function is normal. Monitor for any changes in renal function. o Drugs that increase risk of bleeding should be avoided or used with extreme caution, depending on the severity of liver disease. o Drugs that are highly dependent on the liver for deactivation or clearance are likely to need dose reduction in moderate to severe liver disease. o Avoid sedating drugs in patients at risk of developing encephalopathy. Many of these drugs have long half -lives and are metabolised by the liver so their duration and intensity of action may be prolonged. The brain also becomes more sensitive to sedating effects in liver disease. A sedative drug may precipitate or mask encephalopath y. The doses of highly protein -bound drugs may need reducing in patients with low albumin levels due to chronic liver disease. Drug prescribing should be kept to a minimum - use the smallest effective doses at the greatest interval, and titrate according to clinical response. Keywords : Include drug names and LIVER and LIVER FUNCTION- IMPAIRED or LIVER DISEASES. Also consider LIVER FUNCTION TESETS if appropriate.

Local resources Answering the enquiry NOTE: Always ensure you are using up- to-date resources as changes to vaccines schedules and catch -up programmes may not be included in current editions of printed resources. Reassure callers that having an extra dose of a vaccine is not usually a cause for concern. Many preparations are formulated with multiple vaccines and it is inevitable that some patients will receive doses of vaccines they do not require. The most likely adverse effect in this situation is irritation at the site of injection. Be aware of the difference between live and inactivated vaccines. Live vaccines can, in some situations, cause severe or fatal infections in immunosuppressed individuals due to extensive replication of the vaccine strain. Consider the risk/benefit of vaccination. Unless there is a reliable vaccine history, individuals should be assumed to be unimmunised and a full course of immunisations planned.

Note that SPC warnings are often extrapolated from other drugs in the same class and an assessment should be made as to how relevant this is to the individual drug. If there is likely to be little experience with the two drugs used together e.g. new drug or rarely used, review interactions with drugs from the same class and consider the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics.

Local resources Answering the enquiry Safety of medication in g laucoma enquiries Primary open angle glaucoma - there is very little risk of triggering angle closure with medication. However, ensure patient can identify the signs of acute angle closure. Primary angle closure glaucoma patients will usually have had some type of intervention to allow the eye to drain. Establish if surgery has been successful i.e. if the eye is now completely stable and draining. In this situation the risk of precipitating acute angle closure is low. This type of glaucoma can often occur rapidly (acute). Ensure patient can identify the signs of acute angle closure. For any other type of glaucoma, please consult specialist advice. Dry eye management advice What drops have already been tried - did they work? What time of day are symptoms worse? Are there any aggravating factors e.g. computer use, air conditioning etc. Use lubricating drops more often in these situations. Patients with severe disease may require f requent application of drops. If more than four applications are used daily, consider using a preservative- free product as the risk of irritation from the preservative UKMi Qual ity and Risk Management Group MEDICINES INFORMATION ENQUIRY ANSWERING GUIDELINES Version: 1. 2 Date of Preparation: October 2020 Date for Review: October 2022 Resources updated February 2022 Page 63 of 119 increases with the frequency of dosing. Also consider preservative content of other drops taken by the patient. The preservative that most often causes eye irritation is benzalkonium chloride. Eye ointments containing paraffin may be uncomfortable and blur vision, so they should usually be used at night. Contact lens use may cause or exacerbate dry eye. Does the patient wear contact lenses? If so, what kind? See contact lenses below. Suitability of preservative -containing eye drops and c ontact lens' use If asked whether eye drops containing preservatives can be used with contact lenses consider: Which type of contact lenses does the patient wear? This will help determine whether the patient requires a preservative free eye drop. If using hard/rigid/scleral lens - eye drops containing preservatives can be used. Gas permeable lenses - establish the type of material, but in most cases eye drops containing preservatives can be used. If unsure, seek advice from contact lens practitioner. Soft/hydrophilic lens - eye drops containing preservatives cannot be used. Choice of treatment in ocular Infections When recommending treatment for an ocular infection , consult local antimicrobial guidelines. If swabs have been taken for an eye infection, establish what antimicrobials the organism has been tested against. Not all antimicrobials which are used in ophthalmology are used in sensitivity tests. Establish any resistant organisms. Establish the specific location of the infection e.g. cornea (keratitis), internal eye tissues (endophthalmitis). This will help determine the appropriate choice of antimicrobial e.g. spectrum and bioavailability. Infections in the posterior segment of the eye may require systemic or intravitreal therapy. Severe infections may need very frequent application of drops ( up to half hourly in some cases). This may include administration throughout the night. Use of eye drops in renal or liver impairment, pregnancy or breastfeeding or where there is a potential risk of adverse effects Check product information carefully. Of ten, such cautions are based upon systemic use of the medicine, rather than local, ocular use. If so, o Significant problems are very uncommon as only a very small amount of topical medication reaches the blood stream. o Pressure on the lacrimal punctum for at least a minute after applying eye drops reduces nasolacrimal drainage and therefore decreases systemic absorption from the nasal mucosa.

American Pharmacists Association (LexiComp Incorporated) . This includes more than 900 drug monographs. Over 100 monographs contain an extemporaneous formulation to prepare a liquid solution where no licensed product is available. Local resources Answering the enquiry Consider whether recommendations are within the drug's licensed indications or whether you are advising off -label use. Prescribing unlicensed medicines, or medicines outside the terms of their licence (off -label), alters the prescriber's professional responsibility and liability. The prescriber and pharmacist should have sufficient information to support using the medicine. Be aware that the manufacturer's patient information leaflet may not be relevant to the child and the parents should be warned of this and appropriately reassured. When calculating a dose on an mg/kg basis never exceed the maximum recommended dose (usually the adult dose). If the child is obese consider calculating using ideal body weight. When assessing the appropriate dose (making reference to available paediatric dosage formularies) take account of available formulations and their suitability. If doses require calculation based on surface area, use recognised reference tables (see back pages of BNF for Children) or a recognised formula to calculate surface area. With smaller doses used in paediatrics it is much easier to make ten- fold errors in calculations. Be especially vigilant with decimal points or avoid using them (and quote appropriate units in full), e.g. 100 micrograms NOT 0.1mg. Do not use trailing zeros, e.g. 5mg NOT 5.0mg. Always have calculations checked. Always quote dose to be given rather than volume of liquid to avoid potential for errors, as multiple strengths of medicines (and manufactured specials) are common in paediatric practice. Consider timin g of administration to avoid giving during school time if possible. Consider the hours the child will be awake to avoid interrupting sleep to give medicines. Opt for once or twice daily dosing where appropriate. Consider formulation and appropriateness for the child's age. As a general rule, liquid formulations are preferable for children aged less than five years. Choose sugar -free formulations where available. If a sugar -containing preparation has to be used, provide advice on teeth cleaning after adminis tration to reduce risk of dental caries. The availability of a formulation in an apparently suitable form does not ensure its suitability for use in children. Consider excipients, e.g. alcohol, sorbitol. For premature or low birth weight infants with ver y low total fluid requirements, concentrated preparations may be more appropriate than dilute ones. Consider how the dose will be given: o Will an oral syringe be necessary or is it better to provide a formulation where the dose is contained in 5mL? Round the dose up or down if it makes administration easier (and safer) if the medicine has a wide therapeutic range. o If the parents are considering mixing the medicine with a drink to mask the taste check the potential for drug- drink interaction and advise that t hey should mix with a small volume of drink. The whole drink must be consumed to ensure the intended dose is given. o Avoid mixing the dose in a baby's feeding bottle. o If no suitable liquid formulation is available, consider crushing tablets or opening capsules and mixing with a small amount of soft food, again ensuring the whole dose is consumed. Always consider potential for drug- food or drug- drink interaction. Remember this renders use of the product off-label . Avoid intramuscular injections where possible. The exception to this may be for one off doses where there is no other suitable formulation, e.g. vaccines.

The local community pharmacist may require details of special -order manufacturers to obtain the product; these can be very expensive.

A patient's condition can change rapidly so it is imperative that their response to drug therapy is monitored and assessed frequently. Always make one change at a time; then reassess to judge whether the change is helpful. Equivalent doses between opioids are approximate and can differ greatly between resources so patients must always be monitored carefully and regularly if transferred to another opioid. Check several resources when deciding on an equivalent dose. Always have calculations checked. Calculation errors involving opioid dose conversions are commonly reported to the UKMi IRMIS database. The UKMi Clinical Governance Working Group strongl y recommends : o Have all calculations checked by an independent person. o Do not be pressured into answering enquiries requiring calculations within an unrealistic timescale. o If no independent person is available to check a calc ulation, and delaying the answer would be detrimental to patient care, inform the enquirer that the calculation hasn't been second checked, document this in the answer field, and obtain a retrospective second check as soon as possible.

What is the patient's age, sex and weight? Do they have any renal or hepatic impairment ? (for background information required and relevant calculations please see the enquiry answering guidelines ' Drug use in hepatic impairm ent' and ' Renal impairment '). Does the patient have any other disease states or conditions that may affect drug -handling e.g. hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypoalbuminaemia? Is there concurrent medication? Have any previous drug levels been taken? If so, check the exact time they were taken in relation to drug administration and confirm the units of measurement. Pharmacokinetic definitions and calculations Bioavailability (F): the fraction of the dose that reaches the systemic ci rculation as intact drug. Bioavailability = Bioavailability factor (F) x dose Volume of distribution (Vd): a hypothetical volume that relates the concentration of drug in the plasma to the total amount of drug in the body. Vd (L) = Total amount of drug in the body (mg) Plasma drug concentration (mg/L) Clearance (Cl): the volume of blood cleared of drug per unit time. T he units are normally litres per hour or ml per minute. Cl = F x (Dose/Dose interval) Average steady state plasma drug concentration (C ss) Loading dose: the dose required to rapidly achieve the desired plasma drug concentration (C) Loading dose = Vd x C F Maintenance dose: the regular dose required to m aintain the desired plasma drug concentration. Maintenance dose = Cl x C ss x dose interva l F Steady -state: the equilibrium achieved after multiple dosing when the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. At steady -state the amount of drug in the body, and the average plasma concentration, are constant. Half-life: is the time taken for the amount of drug in the body (or the plasma concentration) to fall by half. Half-life determines both time to reach steady -state conditions with chronic dosing and time for elimination. I t takes approximately 5 half -lives to achieve steady -state conditions or for a drug to be completely eliminated from the plasma. (NOTE : the situation is more complex for drugs with multi -exponential half -lives). Half-life is a function of Vd and inversely proportional to clearance: Half-life (hrs) = 0.693 x Volume of distribution (L) Clearance (L/hr) UKMi Qual ity and Risk Management Group MEDICINES INFORMATION ENQUIRY ANSWERING GUIDELINES Version: 1. 2 Date of Preparation: October 2020 Date for Review: October 2022 Resources updated February 2022 Page 85 of 119 Resources Source Notes First -line resources In-house past enquiries .

Be aware that referral to the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS , telephone 0344 892 0111) may be required. Urgent medical attention may be necessary . The key information required before answering an enquiry about a potential poisoning or overdose includes: Intent - Intentional or accidental Who? Patient - age and weight What? Agent - brand name of the medicine/product or the ingredient(s). When? Time - as accurate a time as is possible for a single ingestion/ exposure or the timeframe over which multiple ingestions / exposures occurred. How much? Amount - the amount ingested or relevant indicator blood levels. Route - ingestion, inhalation, skin, eye, injection, bite/sting, other, unknown. Symptoms - any useful information relating to the condition of the patient. While descriptions such as 'respiratory depression' and 'renal dysfunction' are acceptable, to ensure their usefulness in patient assessment, they should ideally be supported with relevant clinical parameters. Features and trends in monitoring parameters are very important in assessing a patient. Circumstances - accidental, deliberate, administration error, drug ID unknown. Type - acute, acute- on-chronic, chronic, staggered, unknown. Action taken - Did the patient or carer try any self -care in response to the ingestion / exposure? If the patient has burns advise to irrigate with water for at least 20 minutes while waiting for formal clinical assessment and care. If the person has life- threatening symptoms (e.g. is unconscious or having difficulty breathing) urge the caller to call an ambulance. Poor provision of key information can mean that the referral onward to a suitable health care professional or NPIS, can be unnecessarily prolonged as further necessary information is gathered. This can result in a delay in the patient's treatment.

Patient -age, general health, pregnant or trying to conceive? Has the patient taken the medicine already? Or is this a prospective enquiry? The ideal is to consider medicines before exposure. While you may be in a position to simply advise against exposure if it has not already been taken. More detailed scans, reduced doses, additional drug monitoring etc. may be necessary if exposure has occurred. What? Medicine - the proposed medicine(s) and any other medicines the patient is taking or wants to take (generic or brand name, dose, frequency, route) . o Is drug therapy necessary? Have other therapies/medicines been tried? o Has the patient been on this or alternative medicine(s) during previous pregnancies and were symptoms controlled? Why? Indication - it is helpful to know the indication in order to be able to advise best about risk/benefit (and necessity of drug) and to suggest alternatives if necessary . Pregnancy Stage of pregnancy in weeks - at the time of the enquiry and at the time of the exposure. Be as accurate as possible as developmental sensitiv ities to teratogens may be dependent on stage of pregnancy. Have any investigations been performed? Previous pregnancies or miscarriages?

Consider the implications of unmanaged acute and chronic conditions on the expectant mother and developing baby's health. Consider the period of gestation and, if possible, avoid all drugs during the first trimester. Where appropriate, use the lowest effective dose for as short a period as possible. Older drugs are often preferred to newer drugs as there is more information about their safety. Avoid polypharmacy where possible. Remember to consider maternal contraindications and precautions. Reassure the patient/enquirer if the drug has already been taken and if there is no indication from the literature that the drug poses significant harm.

Local resources Answering the enquiry Patients not on renal replacement therapies (RRT) - for more in- depth guidance see Medicines Q&A What factors need to be considered when dosing patients with renal impairment? There are three approaches to altering drug maintenance doses in patients with renal impairment: o Give the standard dose at extended intervals. o Give a reduced dose at usual intervals. o Give a combination of reduced dose and extended interval. Drugs that requ ire maintenance of a serum concentration over the dosing interval should be administered at usual intervals, but with reduced doses. Drugs for which specific peak serum concentrations must be achieved should be dosed with the standard dose at extended intervals. UKMi Qual ity and Risk Management Group MEDICINES INFORMATION ENQUIRY ANSWERING GUIDELINES Version: 1. 2 Date of Preparation: October 2020 Date for Review: October 2022 Resources updated February 2022 Page 100 of 119 For most drugs single doses will be the same as for those with normal renal function. Loading doses of some drugs may need adjustment. When choosing a drug for patients with renal impairment: o Only use drugs where there is a definite indication for prescribing. o Choose a drug that has minimal or no nephrotoxicity. o Use recommended dosage regimens for renal impairment. o Use plasma concentration measurements to adjust dose if possible and clinically relevant. o Monitor for evidence of clinical efficacy and t oxicity. Patients on renal replacement therapies (RRT) - for more in- depth guidance see Medicines Q&A What factors need to be considered when dosing patients on renal replacement therapies? : There are a number of inter -dependent factors that need to be considered when dosing patients on RRT. Consider the drug, the patient and type of RRT. Alteration of drug dosage is usually only necessary if renal clearance exceeds 25% of total body clearance. Drugs which are cleared by the kidneys are usually dialysed, and vice versa, although there are some anomalies. Dose adjustment for RRT is normally only necessary for drugs that require dose adjustment because of the presence of renal failure. No RRT is as effective as the normal kidney - so for most drugs doses used will never be larger than those recommended in normal renal function. Physicochemical drug characteristics affecting drug removal include protein binding, volume of distribution, water/lipid solubility, and molecular weight. Drugs that are highly protein bound (>80%) and/or have a large Vd (>1L/kg), are unlikely to be removed to a significant degree. In general, very large molecules are less likely to be removed than smaller ones. Pharmacokinetic studies that formed the basis for many of the drug dosing recommendations used today were performed in the 1980s and 1990s using less efficient techniques of RRT than those employed currently. These studies varied in design, used different haemofilters, blood, dialysate and ultrafiltration rates and calculated drug clearance by different methods. Advice on drug dosage in continuous RRT from the literature should therefore be applied cautiously to individual patients. Dosing recommendations based on this older data may result in underdosing of drugs e.g. antibiotics. In patients on HD, dose after the dialysis session otherwise a proportion of the drug may be removed during the HD session and its duration of action reduced. For CRRT and CAPD, since these are continuous processes, there is no need to schedule doses around RRT sessions. For toxic drugs, and for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, drug monitoring with measurements of plasma concentrations, where available, and monitoring of the patient for therapeutic response and adverse effects, are essential. NOTE: Information from specialist sour ces may provide dosing information outside the product licence. The omission of a drug from reference sources does not imply that the drug is safe for use in patients with impaired renal function. You should consider other therapeutic options that don't require adjustment in renal failure e.g. drugs that are primarily metabolised by the liver.

No prophylaxis regimen is 100% effective, so include general advice regarding protection against mosquito bites - use of mosquito nets, insecticides, insect repellents, wearing long- sleeved clothing after sunset etc. Preferred malaria prophylaxis regimens should always be recommended unless there are medical reasons why this is not possible. Alternative regimens may not give optimal prophylaxis. During pregnancy, travel to malarious areas should be avoided w herever possible. If travel is unavoidable, effective malaria prophylaxis should be used, as the risk of malaria to both the mother and foetus is greater than the risk from antimalarial drugs at recommended doses. Vaccines may be administered where the r isk of exposure outweighs the risk of vaccination.

Holistic assessment should take account of medical history as well as factors that may delay healing that include mobility, nutrition and personal circumstances. Most organisations will have a tissue viability nurse who will be better placed to advise on choice of dressings in individual circumstances. For many specialist wounds e.g. burns it is unlikely you will be asked to advise on anything other than product availability. However, in the absence of specialist healthcare professionals, the following will give you some pointers where to start. In order to advise on choice of wound management product , consider the following: What type of wound is it e.g. surgical, pressure sore, burns, extravasation? What colour is the wound? How long has the patient had the wound? This may give an impression of complexity of the wound. What stage is the wound at i.e. does it need debridement or is it at the granulating stage? What p roducts have been tried already and what problems have there been? Concomitant medication (may delay wound healing)? Are there special factors that need to be addressed e.g. high amount of exudate, malodorous? Could it be infected, if so, have swabs been t aken? Any known allergies (especially to wound management products)?
