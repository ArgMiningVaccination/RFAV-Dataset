It will change fami- lies, health care, the workplace,and the economy. Not only willit alter life in the United States,but it will also bring sweepingchanges throughout the world. This revolution is the trans- formation of the massive babyboom generation into the largestelderly population in humanhistory. It was referred to years ago by gerontologist Ken Dychtwald as the age wave . Boomers\u2014the 76 million Ameri-cans born between 1946 and1964\u2014will soon begin turning65. Some 70 million Americanswill be over 65 by 2030, morethan twice as many as in 1997.In the wake of that shift willcome major societal ch anges and a new understanding of what itmeans to be old.Living Longer and Better The beginning of a newspa- per article describing 105-year- old George Fugate read: \"Hedidn't have a regular doctoruntil he was 100. A checkupshowed he was in fine health,just getting old.\" Mr. Fugate hasa lot of company as more andmore of us live longer, healthierlives. In 1900, life expectancy inthe United States was only 47years. Today, thanks to improvedsanitation, disease control, and nutrition, most newborns can expect to live about 30 yearslonger than that. Because ofmedical advances and healthierlifestyles, seniors today are lesslikely to have a chronic disabil-ity. A smaller percentage ofAmericans over 65 requirenursing home care, and moreare living on their own withlittle or no outside help.Making the Most of Your Later Life AdventureAging Gracefully Prepared by Sam Quick, Ph.D., Extension Human Development and Family Relations Specialist;Peter Hesseldenz, M.A., Staff Support Associate, Department of Family Studies; Celia Hayhoe,Ph.D., CFP, Assistant Professor, Department of Family Studies; Sandra Bastin, Ph.D., R.D.,L.D., Extension Food and Nutrition Robert H. Flashman, Ph.D., Extension FamilyResource Management Specialist.2The coming decades will surely bring still greater ad-vances, extending the humanlife-span even further. Centenar-ians (people 100 years old orolder), today's fastest growingpopulation group, will becomemore and more common. Many older people today are embracing life with surprising gusto. Photographer and authorEtta Clark, in her 1995 bookGrowing Old Is Not for Sissies II , described Rose Schwartz, a 94-year-old dancerand teacher whose classessometimes have as many as 200students. Redefining what it means to \"act your age,\" Sen. John Glennof Ohio returned to space as anastronaut at age 77. AbrahamGoldstein, who is 101 andperhaps the oldest active profes-sor in the country, has been teaching at Baruch College in New York since 1930. ActorGeorge Burns continued toperform well beyond the 90-year mark. In Arles, France, awoman named Jeanne Calmentremained active even aftermoving out of her apartment atthe age of 110. According toJean-Marie Robine, her biogra-pher and a researcher on aging,one of Ms. Calment's secrets was that she simply didn't let things bother her. Her mottoseemed to be, \"If you can't doanything about it, just accept it.\"Mentally alert through her lastyears, Ms. Calment died in 1997at the age of 122. When Difficulties Strike Of course, later life is not always so rosy, and people don'talways live a long time. Evenwith the best of care, sooner orlater our bodies decline andstop working. Many factorsbeyond our control, such asgenetics, environmental haz- ards, and physical disability, can conspire against us. In addition,major threats such as elderabuse, poverty, depression,Alzheimer's disease, diabetes,heart attacks, and cancer willcontinue to challenge us. Such conditions can be devastating. However, if wekeep a positive attitude, lookout for one another, and callupon our inner resources, often we can ease the difficulties that arise along the journey of aging.After discovering that she hasmultiple sclerosis, aging is a good-hu- mored, beautiful, and gutsyolder woman who has faced theillness and death of loved ones,had her leg amputated, and undergone 30 major surgeries.Yet, her eyes filled with tears ofjoy during a research interviewas she said, \"I can't imagineanyone having a more wonder-ful than And shemeant it! A deeply spiritualperson, Mrs. Hilen has learned to both accept and transcend major challenges. In addition toperspective and hope, her richspiritual life gives her remark-able strength, guidance, andhappiness. Old Age Has Its Own Treasures In often subtle yet powerful ways, our culture still sends themessage that growing old is afailure, something to be avoidedat all costs. Actually , the lateryears frequently abound with blessings, but in our fear of old age, we may fail to see them.We spend millions of dollars onlaser surgery and all kinds oftreatments designed to pushaway the physical signs of grow-ing old. Why can't we just loveand accept ourselves as we are? Doesn't white hair and weathered, wrinkled skin havea majesty of its own? We need toopen our eyes and hearts and begin to view old age in a new way. And we need to place farmore focus on the inner per-son\u2014on the experience, matu-rity, wisdom, spirituality , andfreedom that are the real trea-sures of life's golden years. Weneed to focus on our innerselves for personal well-beingand because our example willteach and guide younger gen-erations.\"The best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly person.\" \u2014Andy Rooney, television commentator. 3 The Changing Landscape of Aging For years we have been hearing about baby boomersand the coming explosion in theolder population, so you maythink our government andsocial service agencies havefigured out a plan for how todeal with it. Not so, by a longshot! To successfully ride the coming age wave, we need everybody's involvement andcreativity. Here's a brief look ata few of the issues that need ourcollective attention. Our health care system is seriously ill. The cost of health care is rising. It is becomingprohibitive for a large percent-age of older people, and it willonly get worse with increasinglongevity and the huge age wave about to crash onto the world's shores. Much researchtells us that the best way by farto reduce health care costs andincrease quality of life is toadopt healthier lifestyles. Howcan we creatively promoteexercise, healthier eating, andother habits of preventive self-care? How might we help themedical profession, the govern- ment, and insurance companiesplace more emphasis on pro-moting health and preventingdisease? Should we be spendingsignificantly more of our healthcare dollars on prevention andeducation? We need a new definition of old age. For nearly 70 years, the United States has used 65 as theofficial marker of old age.During that time, however, lifeexpectancy has increased dra-matically. Given this increasedlife expectancy and the comingage wave, do we need to changethe marker of old age to 70 orhigher? If we don't, can pro-grams like Social Security andMedicare continue to exist, much less remain strong in the years to come? How do weavoid discriminating againstgroups such as Hispanics andNative Americans, which havehigher mortality rates at earlierages? Should the criteria forservices and support to olderpersons be based on functionalability and financial needinstead of age?Traditional caregivers are unavailable, and the demand foreldercare is increasing. Women, who have traditionally cared forolder family members, are nowtypically employed outside thehome. Baby boomers are havingfewer children and often livegreater distances from their immediate families. If you factor in that we are living longer andbaby boomers are beginning togrow old themselves, it's obvi-ous that a major caregivingcrunch is on our doorstep. Whatinnovative approaches might afamily use in caring for olderloved ones? Who will take careof all the baby boomers Should employersoffer better and more imagina- tive eldercare benefits? What roles might government andfaith communities play? It's time to re-invent long- term care . Most nursing homes have done a good job in the faceof major challenges. But isn't ittime to re-examine long-termcare, using all the creativity wecan muster? Leading the way,physician William Thomas hascreated the Eden Alternative as a way to combat long-term Seven Keys to Well-Being in Later Life Transforming the way our society responds to aging starts with each of us\u2014we can make examples of our own lives through our daily choices. Consider these seven keys towell-being in later life: Physical and mental fitness. Healthy relationships. Good nutrition. Positive attitude. Your heart's desire. Spiritual vitality. Material well-being. Ask yourself: How am I doing in each area? Are there changes I would like to make? Making wise choices\u2014and it's never too late to begin\u2014is at the core of positive aging.4care's plagues: loneliness, help- lessness, and boredom. Bygiving eldersand empowering staff, the EdenAlternative transforms nursinghomes into lush, lively environ-ments with playful children,flower and vegetable gardens,abundant indoor plants, friendly dogs and cats, singing birds, and plenty of communityinvolvement\u2014rich humanhabitats that actively involveresidents and help them thrivein a homelike environment. What can we do to create more living environments likethis? Could Eden Alternativeprinciples be employed inprivate residences that are hometo smaller groups of older men and women who require exten- sive personal assistance? Howcan we make better use of in-home and other community-based services to enable seniorsto function independently intheir own homes as long aspossible? What other innovativeapproaches might we use to re-invent long-term care and makeit less expensive? Consider these seven keys to well-being in later life: physical and mental fitness, good nutri-tion, your heart's desire,material well-being, healthyrelationships, positive attitude,and spiritual vitality. A descrip-tion of these keys follows. Physical and Mental Fitness In a newspaper report on the Tufts University research of MariaFiatarone, M.D., the headlineread, \"90-Something and Pump-ing Iron.\" Dr. Fiatarone f ound that frail men and women in their upper 80s and 90s\u2014most witharthritis and heart disease andusing multiple medications andwalkers\u2014made significant physical, mental, and socialgains after enrolling in a strengthtraining program. Whatever ourage or condition, appropriateexercise is good for us! What are the benefits of regular exercise? You feel betterand tend to enjoy life more. Exercise also helps to keep your heart, lungs, muscles, and bones strong; reduces your riskof heart disease and stroke; andhelps you keep your weight andblood pressure at healthy levels. Exercise acts as a natural lax- ative, eases arthritis, promotesmental alertness, improves cir-culation, and increases energy. Italso reduces stress, depression,and sleeping problems. Regularexercise may even help protect against certain types of cancer. Whether it's walking, playing with grandchildren, strengthtraining, Tai Chi, gentle yoga,square dancing, water aerobics,or swimming, find enjoyableways to exercise and make thema part of your daily life. Don'tlet advancing years be an excusefor unnecessarily limiting your-self. And remember, it's alwaysa good idea to touch base with a health care professional before beginning an exercise program. Also, periodically undergo a physical checkup and appropri-ate screening tests for cancer.Discuss your immunizationneeds with your physician.Dental care is essential to youroverall health, so floss daily andvisit your dentist regularly. You need to consistently exercise your mind to keep it in good shape, just as you do your body. The speed at which weprocess information slows withadvancing age; it may be harderto remember a name or fact ondemand. However, other kindsof memory show little or nodecline with age and may actually improve if \"exercised.\" Enjoy a variety of activities that can keep your mind alertand sharp, such as reading,writing, playing a musicalinstrument, or engaging instimulating conversation. Yourmind thrives on acquiring new information and skills. Make learning, curiosity, and creativ-ity lifelong habits. Finally, keep in mind that plenty of sleep is essential inorder to function well physi-cally and mentally. Good Nutrition If you eat a healthy meal three times a day, you havenearly 1,100 chances a year tohelp your body age in the best way possible. Each serving of a fruit or vegetable, whole-graincereal, or protein-rich seafood and every glass of water or juice has a positive effect on yourbody, mind, and spirit. Older people need to eat a variety of wholesome foods, asdo people of all ages. Besidesensuring a balanced intake ofnutrients, foods with a range oftastes, textures, smells, and colors add to the pleasure and adventure of eating. Experimentwith new foods and recipes.Particularly if you live alone,remember that the occasionalcompany of family and friendscan make a good meal evenmore special. The Food Guide Pyramid published by the U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture gives apractical summary of general dietary recommendations: Each day eat at least six helpings ofgrain-based food, such asbreads, cereals, pasta, and rice.Whole grains are always a great 5choice. Fruits and vegetables are of prime importance; eat five ormore servings of them everyday. Have several servings ofprotein-rich foods, such as low-fat dairy products, lean meat,poultry, fish, beans, soy, or nuts.Consume only small amounts offats, oils, and sweets. In later life, we are at risk for dehydration, so do your best todrink eight 8-ounce glasses ofwater, juice, or other liquids eachday. Taking in enough fluids hasmany benefits, including reduc-ing constipation problems\u2014afrequent concern of the elderly. Toprotect against bone loss, foods rich in calcium and vitamin D areessential. A modest intake ofvitamin and mineral supplements may be a good idea; check with your nutritionist or physician. For a variety of reasons, many older people do not eat well. Alack of mobility or money canlimit access to adequate amountsand varieties of food. Olderpeople living alone may be lessmotivated to prepare satisfactorymeals. Depression and poor oralhealth, such as ill-fitting dentures,can affect a person's eating habits, as can aging-related decline in taste and smell. Make your food choices count. Particularly if you areover 70, try to eat foods that arenutrient-dense but low incalories. It's never too late tochoose healthier eating habits orto encourage a friend or lovedone to do the same. Your Heart's Desire We all want a future filled with hope, and gerontologists have discovered that one of thesecrets of positive aging is re-maining interested in andactively involved with life.Before his death in teacher Rebbe MenachemSchneerson is perhaps the most need\u2014and who can best teach all of us\u2014to lead a meaningful life.\" Take a little quiet time to be alone and do some soul-search-ing. What is your heart's desire?What gives meaning to yourlife? What brings you joy? Whatdo you love to do? Perhaps thereis a particular gift or service youwould like to offer your lovedones or the world. Maybe thefamily you raised and your daily life continue to be your primary source of joy and mean-ing. Perhaps you want to travel,or maybe you want to slow downand take it easy for a while.When you have a dream and commit yourself to achieving it,you feel a new sense of zest andthe circumstances in your lifewill often support your vision.Don't talk yourself out of some-thing you really want to dosimply because it may not seempractical, or you're worried about what others may think, or you feel it's too late. If yourvision is not crystal clear oryou're unsure about it, why notjust pay attention to thepromptings of your heart andtake a few small steps forward?Allow your intuition to guideyou as you explore your dream. In a fresh way , tune into your deepest longings and dreams. Atthis time in your life, what would you like to do or be? Create a simple drawing or another re-minder of your dream and put itwhere you will see it often. Makesure that the way you are spend-ing your time matches yourdream. Each day do what you canto help your heart's desire growmore real and beautiful. Material Well-Being For a variety of reasons, many older people are \"retiring\" from retirement and choosing to re- enter the world of work. Othersretire from a long-term careerand work part-time or try theirhand at a totally different typeof employment, perhaps work-ing at a more relaxed pace. And,of course, many seniors volun-teer their services and talents,thereby making invaluablecontributions. With the arrivalof the large wave of aging baby boomers, the so-called retire- ment years promise to be filledwith even more possibilities. Still, no matter what lifestyle choices we make, wise retire-ment planning remains basic to\"I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing. It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive.\" \u2014Oriah Mountain Dreamer, author. 6material well-being in later life. Decide on your vision of retire-ment and start planning for it assoon as possible. Take advan-tage of recent changes in tax lawand put away as much as pos-sible in tax-deferred savings. Be sure you have adequately planned for your potential long- term care needs as well as the management of your assets. Dur-able power of attorney for assetsand health care is a must, as isan up-to-date will. If your assetsare large, estate planning for taxpurposes may be necessary. You might think of the first 10 to 15 years of your retirement asparticularly active years. If youchoose to travel or engage inleisure activities that require a lot of money, you might actually need more money to live onthan you do now. Choosing tosupplement your retirement in-come during these active yearswith an enjoyable, flexible jobcould give you both satisfactionand needed income. You may also wish to consider a living trust. Living trusts arenot just for the wealthy\u2014theyallow for management of your assets if you become incapaci- tated. A chief advantage is thatthey allow your property topass to your heirs without goingthrough probate. Money management is central to material well-being, but thatwell-being also includes thequality of your living environ-ment (whether it's your home oranother residential setting) andmaterial belongings that truly contribute to your happiness. For example, if you or a lovedone were to become disabled,how safe and user-friendlywould your home be? In laterlife, what kind of living arrange-ments would maximize yourability to remain independent,happy , and cre ative? Are there ways to unclutter your physical surroundings or make themmore beautiful? Many people find, as they move into the second half oflife, that a life simple in materialgoods brings with it a cherishedrichness and freedom. Using one's financial resources to assist others who are less fortunatecan be a particularly rewardingexperience. Healthy Relationships True friends and supportive family members are definitelygood medicine, particularly inthe later years. When we havepositive relationships, we stayhealthier, live longer, and enjoylife more. Even caring for petsand plants nourishes our well- being. Researcher and physician Dean Ornish, speaking of thehealing power of loving rela-tionships, said: \"I am not awareof any other factor in medi-cine\u2014not diet, not smoking, notexercise, not stress, not genetics,not drugs, not surgery\u2014that hasa greater impact on our qualityof life, incidence of illness, andpremature death from all causes.\" To thrive, not only physically but also emotionally, mentally,and spiritually, supportiverelationships are a must. Weneed to look out for one anotherand, to the extent that it's wel-come, offer friendly assistance. Our society desperately needs older people who are willing toshare their wisdom with indi-viduals of all ages. V olunteer orpart-time work can be a great way to contribute your knowl- edge and skills while stayingsocially connected. Helpingothers is good for your bodyand soul. It reduces excessive focus on oneself, improvesmood and well-being, andbuilds strong communities. Equally beneficial are more informal ways of reaching outand serving: taking a frail friendshopping or to a social gather-ing or teaching a child to cook, read, or build a birdhouse. Never underestimate the in- fluence of your touch, thoughtful-ness, smiles, generosity, andwords of encouragement. Suchgestures of kindness feed yourwell-being and ripple out,blessing all those around you. We are never too old to make new friends and bond withfamily members in deeperways. To age well, we need to connect with people so we can freely give and receive love. Positive Attitude One of the best ways to make something happen is to predictit. Henry Ford, builder of thefamous Model T car, said, \"Ifyou think you can or can't,you're right.\" Hundreds ofresearch studies confirm this\u2014that our experiences are shapedby the beliefs and attitudes we choose. This is one of the secrets of optimal aging. To a surpris-ing degree, the beliefs we holdabout aging become self-fulfill-ing prophecies. If you trulybelieve you can remain physi-cally vigorous and mentallysharp in your later years, yourchances of doing so are greatlyenhanced. If you are convincedthat old age abounds in oppor-tunities, you'll see interesting possibilities all around you. The many changes and losses that come with aging amplychallenge even the most upbeatof personalities. But don't be 7discouraged. Like any skill, staying positive takes lots ofpractice, persistence, and a will-ingness to learn from mistakes. The more you practice stay- ing positive, the better at ityou'll become and the morebenefits you'll reap. Keep inmind that older people have a major advantage in meeting life's challenges\u2014they can buildupon a wealth of success andexperience. A positive attitude isa choice you make many timeseach day. It's also a great stressbuster. People with genuinelypositive attitudes are acceptingof themselves and others andlearn from all their feelings,including the wide array ofdifficult-but-healing emotions that accompany grief. Even if your past has been filled with unhappiness, youcan make a fresh start right nowby choosing to be positive. Asauthor Tom Robbins assures us,\"It's never too late to have ahappy childhood.\" Spiritual Vitality Polls show that about 95 percent of Americans believe ina divine being or higher power. For the rest of the U.S. popula- tion, spirituality is often morefocused on feeling close tonature, expressing creativity orkindness, finding peace ofmind, or contributing to thewell-being of society. The evidence is clear: Faith, prayer, and being a part of aspiritual community are power-ful allies in coping with thechallenges of aging. Larry Dossey, respected researcher, physician, and author sums itup nicely: \"There are at least 250studies showing that people whofollow some type of religiouspractice in their lives\u2014and thatalmost always includes prayer\u2014 are healthier across-the-boardcompared to people who don't.They go to the doctor less often.They consume fewer health caredollars. They get sick lessoften.\"According to DukeUniversity researcher HaroldKoenig, M.D., they also manage stress better, recover faster, live longer, and tend to have stron-ger immune systems. Some adventuresome older people, as part of their spiritualperspective, have chosen to viewaging as an advanced curricu-lum for the soul. They see laterlife as an unusually challengingtime\u2014a time for which all theirprevious experiences haveprepared them. The physical decline that is part of aging reminds them that who theyreally are is far more than theirbodies. As death approaches,they keenly realize that each moment is a gift. With peoplewho are receptive, these eldersshare the hard-earned wisdomand the unique perspective agehas given them. They embracefree time as an opportunity forreflection or prayer. Even majorsetbacks are received as advanced lessons in learning. Strokes that might leave them dependent onothers, for example, could forthem be a lesson in learninghow to trust and accept whatcan't be changed. Spirituality\u2014-however we each may choose to express it\u2014has the potential to connect uswith a faith and love that cantranscend outer difficulties andeven the decline and death of the physical body. As we advance in age, we have fewer years remaining, and they are therefore more precious. Eachmoment becomes a treasure filled with opportunity. See the world with eyes of wonder and appre-ciation and listen carefully to the whispers of your heart. Focus on your blessings and develop a keeneye for goodness and beauty. Take time to smile, chuckle, and play. Even during difficulttimes, look for the bright spots and do your best to scatter kind- ness and love wherever you go. Whatever your age and whatever limitations you may have, you are special, not onlybecause of what you do, but also because of who you are inside. You are a gift to the world. Doyour best each day to leave your corner of it a little brighter. \"I want to cry out that the invisible part of me is not old. In aging we gain as well as lose. It's a time when our spiritual forces seem to expand. A life of the heart and mind takes over as our physical force ebbs away.\" \u2014A 90-year-old woman.
