As a team of interdisciplinary investigators who are experts in big data, qualitative methods and translational research, with a focus on vulnerable populations (i.e., LGBTQ, justice-involved, veterans), we seek to inform current and emerging challenges related to the opioid epidemic, mental health and comorbid chronic disease. We intend that our research will be utilized by clinicians, patients, community members and policymakers to help patients thrive. With continuous methodological innovation and engagement with the community we serve, we seek to be the national leader in research informed by social justice and contribute to evidence-based care. Faculty Jeffrey Scherrer, Ph.D. Jeffrey Scherrer joined the department in 2013. He is a clinical epidemiologist and health services researcher focused on the mental health consequences of chronic prescription opioid use. His other primary research area concerns the mind-body interface and the health consequences of psychiatric disorders.
