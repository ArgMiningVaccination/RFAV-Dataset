Service Public Health [] Vaccinations and Medications during Service Some Veterans have raised concerns about certain vaccines and medications they received while serving in the military. Photo: U.S. Department of Defense - VA continues to evaluate the health effects of [Gulf War vaccinations](/exposures/gulfwar/sources/vaccinations.asp), including anthrax and botulinum toxoid. [Pyridostigmine bromide (PB)](/exposures/gulfwar/sources/pyridostigmine-bromide.asp)is a pre-treatment drug taken by service members during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to protect against nerve agent attacks. [Mefloquine (Lariam\u00ae)](/exposures/mefloquine-lariam.asp)is a drug given to service members to protect against malaria, an infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It is used less than it has been in the past. - Anthrax vaccine is a series of six shots to protect against the infectious, bacterial disease anthrax, which has been used in biological warfare. Learn more from the [Military Health System](https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Immunization-Healthcare/Vaccine-Preventable-Diseases/Anthrax). - Smallpox vaccine prevents smallpox, a deadly, viral disease. Because there is concern that smallpox could be used as a biological weapon, service members are vaccinated against it. Learn more from [Medline Plus](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/smallpox.html). If you are concerned about long-term side effects from vaccinations or medications during your military service, talk to your health care provider or contact your [local VA Environmental Health Coordinator](/exposures/coordinators.asp) to help you get more information from a health care provider.
