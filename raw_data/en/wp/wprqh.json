Come to the Campus Center Information Desk (across from Starbucks) and check out one of our amazing books. Immigrants come to UAlbany from around the world and each one has a unique story to tell. Some come directly here through traditional pathways and for some, their journeys involve harrowing trips that take years and many stops along the way. Some are fleeing hardships; others seeking opportunities. This year's books are students, fa culty, administrators, and staff members. But every story teaches us something different about the ways we all ended up as part of the UAlbany family. Check out last year's UAlbany Human Library Project!
