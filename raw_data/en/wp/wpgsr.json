Homeopathy was invented in the early 1800s by a German doctor called Samuel Hahnemann. Keen to find an alternative to the harmful medical practices of his day, he drew on the theories of ancient philosophers such as Hippocrates and Paracelcus to explore the principle of 'like cures like'. This notion, that a substance can be used to cure the symptoms that it causes, finds parallels in the modern theory of immunisation. Through his experiments he found that, when prepared in a particular way, the efficacy of the substance was improved as the dose was reduced. Homeopathy is now used by over 200 million people worldwide. This makes it the second most popular system of healthcare, after conventional medicine. One of the great benefits of homeopathy is that, when prescribed by a trained practitioner, it is completely safe for everyone to use, including pregnant women, babies and the elderly. It has no side effects, and the remedies are non-toxic and non-addictive. Homeopathy is environmentally friendly and ethically sound. Homeopathy can be safely used alongside conventional medication, and can support those living with disabilities and with chronic or life limiting illness.
