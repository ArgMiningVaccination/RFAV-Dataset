Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, cupping therapy (dry cupping), gua sha are all capable of boosting immunity. While each of these modalities is capable of strengthening the weak immune system, being part of traditional Chinese medicine, they work well in combination with each other. But if you wonder how to boost your immune system as much as possible, then the latest research has shown that traditional Chinese and western medical methods work even better when they are integrated into one treatment strategy designed for individual patients. Considering that western medicine relies heavily on its pharmacologic component, Chinese herbal medicine presents certain limitations that arise from possible interactions with drugs. Due to the large selection of traditional Chinese medical methods, other modalities, such as acupuncture, cupping therapy, gua sha, and therapeutic exercises provide a wide range of effective alternatives, whose potency becomes even greater in combination with other approaches.
