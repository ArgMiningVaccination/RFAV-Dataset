Scientific studies have shown that extreme stress can adversely affect our mental health and can decrease the function of our immune system. Because mind and body function together, worrying about money may cause physical and emotional symptoms. You might feel helpless or depressed. Possibly you experience headaches, digestive problems, or frequent infections. You may feel anxious, irritable, and have difficulty sleeping. [Aromatherapy](//www.blog.swiha.edu/power-aromatherapy/) can be of help by stimulating the brain which can shift your mind and emotions. By breathing in the aromatic vapors of pure essential oils, you can receive many different kinds of therapeutic effects for the physical, emotional, and mental body. The Science When you breathe in, the aroma molecule is translated into a signal by the receptor cells in the nose. This signal is sent to the olfactory bulb and then on to the limbic and hypothalamus parts of the brain. It is believed that the essential oil aroma activates the \"pharmacy\" within our brains; the neurochemicals. These neurochemicals (serotonin, endorphins, etc.) communicate with our nervous and other body systems, to bring the positive changes you need. Consider the possibility that what you smell could affect how you think and feel about money. Create Your Own Prosperity Recipe Basil has a slightly licorice aroma.

How To Use Your Blend Once you decide on your favorite oils, you have many options. You may like the individual scents, or you could experiment with different ratios. Some of the stronger oils, like eucalyptus or patchouli, you will only need one or two drops. Consider your carrier (oil, water, cream) and the amount. Buy a couple spray bottles or misters, and keep one in your car, purse, kitchen, and by the bed. If you use a lot of hand or foot lotion, find your favorite unscented lotion and add the oils you liked best. For super dry skin, use a massage oil; or if you have oily skin, stick to a mister or spray bottle using filtered or solar-charged water. If you don't like products on your skin, use an air diffuser or soak bamboo sticks to freshen the air in your home.
