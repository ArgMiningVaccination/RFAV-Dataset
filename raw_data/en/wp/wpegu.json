Failure of University's Representative to render a decision by the applicable deadline will be deemed a decision denying the Claim on the date of the deadline, unless, upon receipt of a Claim, Contractor and University mutually agree to extend the time periods provided herein, or unless otherwise extended by law. The decision of University's Representative will be final and binding unless appealed in accordance with Articles 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.7. The University's Representative's decision on a Claim or dispute will include a written statement both identifying all disputed and undisputed portions of the Claim and substantially including the following: \"This is a decision under Article 4.5 of the General Conditions of your contract. If you are dissatisfied with the decision, and if you complied with the procedural requirements for asserting claims specified in Article 4 of the General Conditions of your contract, you may have the right to demand in writing an informal conference to meet and confer for settlement of any remaining issues in dispute, following which, i f still dissatisfied, you may demand in writing a further resolution via nonbinding mediation, after which you have the right to arbitrate or litigate this decision. If you fail to take appropriate action within 30 days of the date of this decision, the decision shall become final and binding and not subject to further appeal.\" 4.5.2 If either Contractor or University disputes University's Representative's decision on a Claim, then, within 30 days after the decision of University's Representative on the C laim, or, if no decision has been issued, within 30 days from the date of the applicable deadline in Article 4.5.1 for University Representative Project No. M057295 19 of 48 General Conditions SHER BLDG PHAR M September 16 , 2022 Relocate Pharm Staff from N -S Wings LF:GC to render a decision, such party (the \"Disputing Party\") must provide written notice demanding an informal conference to meet and confer.

The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any controversy or Claim arising out of or relating to this Contract by negotiation at the conference. 4.6 MEDIATION 4.6.1 Within 10 business days following the informal conference to meet and confer stated in Article 4.5.2, if the Claim or any portion of the Claim remains in dispute, the University shall provide a written statement identifying the disputed and undisputed port ions of the Claim. Within 30 days of receipt of the statement, if either Contractor or University disputes any portion of the Claim, then the Disputing Party must provide written notice to the non- disputing party demanding non- binding mediation. The Cont ractor and the University shall share the associated costs equally and shall mutually agree to a mediator within 10 business days. If the parties cannot agree upon a mediator, each party shall select a mediator and those mediators shall select a qualified neutral third party to mediate with regard to the disputed portion of the Claim, with each party bearing the fees and costs of its respective mediator. Mediation shall include, but not be limited to, neutral evaluation, a dispute review board, or other negotiation or evaluation through an independent third party or board. The Contractor and the University may mutually agree to waive any individual mediation in writing and proceed to arbitration or litigation pursuant to this Contract. 4.7 LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION 4.7.1 Either party may provide a written notice of its election to arbitrate or provide written notice of its election to litigate the Claim within 30 days after the mediation pursuant to Article 4.6.1, or, if the parties mutually agreed in writing to waive mediation, within 30 days after the agreement is signed by both parties. 4.7.2 If a notice of election to arbitrate or litigate is not given by either party within 30 days pursuant to Article 4.7.1, University's Representative's decision on the Claim will be final and binding and not subject to appeal or challenge. 4.7.3 If the Disputing Party gives timely notice of its election to arbitrate the University's Representative's decision on a Claim, Disputing Party shall have th e right, within 120 days after a Notice of Completion, or a Notice of Cessation, as applicable, is filed for the Contract, to make a demand for arbitration in accordance with Article 4. 7. Failure to perfect a Claim for which a timely election to arbitrate has been made by the timely filing of a demand for arbitration and timely payment of all applicable and required fees to the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA \") shall result in the University's Representative's decision on said Claim becoming final a nd binding and not subject to appeal or challenge. If the Disputing Party makes a timely demand for arbitration, and the amount of the Claim in question, when combined with all other Claims, if any, which are the subject of previously filed demands for ar bitration that have not been resolved by settlement or arbitration award, is $100,000 or more, then the other party may elect to litigate all such Claims by filing a written notice with the \"AAA\" within 30 days after its receipt of notice from the AAA of the Disputing Party's demand for arbitration of the Claim that raises the total amount of Claims subject to arbitration to $100,000 or more. If the other party fails to give notice of its election to litigate within such 30-day period, it shall be deemed to have consented to arbitration and waived the right to litigate. If after commencement of arbitration the amount of unresolved Claims in arbitration are allowed to be increased to $100,000 or more, through an AAA - allowed amendment or otherwise, either party may elect to litigate within 30 days following the date that the electing party first receives written notification from the AAA that total Claims in arbitration equal or exceed $100,000. If neither party gives notice of its election to litigate withi n such 30-day period as applicable, then both parties shall be deemed to have consented to arbitration and waived the right to litigate. 4.7.4 A demand for arbitration pursuant to Article 4. 7.3 shall include a copy of the Claim presented to University's Representative pursuant to Article 4.4 , a copy of the decision of University's Representative pursuant to Article 4.5, if any , a copy of the University's written statement identifying the portion of the Claim that remained in dispute following the informal conference pursuant to Article 4.6.1, and a summary of the remaining portions of the Claim in dispute.
