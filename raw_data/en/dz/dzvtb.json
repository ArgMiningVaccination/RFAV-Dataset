QDT - 1 x Overview - 1 NSF FY 2020 Budget Request to Congress The National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (Public Law 81- 507) sets forth our mission: \"To promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense...\" On September 22, 2017, after travelling billions of light years through space, a neutrino finally made its way to IceCube, a large neutrino observatory located under the ice at the South Pole. There the neutrino collided with an atom in the ice, producing a shower of particles that were detected by IceCube's sensors. This became the first detection of a high -energy neutrino that can be traced back to an identified source \u2014a type o f galaxy known as a blazar, with a central massive black hole that powers high -velocity jets of particles. Neutrinos are nearly massless particles that can pass through anything they encounter, whether people, planets or galaxies. They are therefore difficult to detect. However, if one of these cosmic messengers is \"stopped in its tracks\" here on Earth, high -technology instrumentation can, at least in principle, pinpoint the location of its origin. In 2004 scientists began developing the means to do just that, namely, to use the vast quantities of clear ice at the South Pole as a way to stop, or capture, neutrinos and to thus try to infer important information about their origin. An NSF commitment to this project fourteen years ago allowed scientists and engineers to begin melting holes 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep in the ice of the South Pole and dropping in more than 80 strings of light sensors, which number 5,160 in all. Today, this cubic kilometer of instrumented ice, containing enough water to fill one million swimming pools, is home to what promises to be some of the most exciting science of our time. The recent neutrino detection, coupled with past detections of neutrinos by IceCube, has already generated new knowledge. Emissions from the jets of b lazars contain not only neutrinos but vast quantities of other subatomic particles and high -energy radiation. Correlation of the neutrino detection with space and ground- based observations of gamma -radiation emitted by these jets confirms the blazar as the first identified source of high -energy cosmic rays, thus solving the 100 -year-old mystery of their origin. A long -term vision, belief in the promise of fundamental research, and commitment to risky, but potentially extraordinary discoveries are the hall marks of NSF. NSF's investments empower discoverers to ask the questions and develop the technologies that lead to the next big breakthroughs. In FY 2020, NSF will continue to support the science, technology, innovation and workforce development that driv es this Nation's economy, ensures the security of the American people, and secure s the U.S.'s place as a global power for generations to come. To achieve these goals, NSF will make strategic investments across the agency to support the heart of NSF's missi on, basic research, while putting an emphasis on convergence\u2014 interdisciplinary research that spans and integrates all areas of science. FY 2020 investments support the Administration's Research and Development Budget Priorities, including artificial intell igence (AI); quantum information science (QIS) research; advanced manufacturing; and microelectronics and semiconductors. These investments will strengthen the Nation's innovation base and contribute to unparalleled job growth, continued prosperity, and na tional security. NSF funds the basic research that builds the foundation of human knowledge while making possible innovations in life -saving medical diagnostics, machine learning, precision agriculture, and countless other areas. Investments in basic and early -stage research create the foundation for these breakthroughs. NSF invests in basic research across all areas of non -medical science and engineering and integrates these Overview Overview - 2 investments with dedicated efforts to educate and train a diverse workforce for t he 21st century economy. Since the agency's founding in 1950, NSF has been at the forefront of the innovations that enhance American prosperity and strength, while ensuring that the Nation's technological and scientific advancements remain the envy of the world. If the U.S. is to remain the global leader in innovation, NSF's role is ever more important. NSF continues to emphasize its 10 Big Ideas, research agendas that identify areas at the frontiers of science and engineering which promise to be among the most transformative in the coming decade. FY 2020 investments will build on progress made in prior y ears to seed or establish these Big Ideas. Of the 10 Big Ideas, six are Research Ideas. These are opportunities for researchers to make the discoveries that will shape the future of everything from quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and agricultur e to space exploration and medical innovation. Each of these ideas will be supported by dedicated investments in core Big Ideas activities, as well as additional investment in foundational support from across the agency. The other four are Enabling Big Ide as, which endeavor to make science and engineering more interdisciplinary and reflective of the rich diversity of the U.S., while supporting investments in infrastructure and risky, high-reward science. For more on NSF's Big Ideas, see the next section of the Overview and the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. NSF promotes efficient and effective management and support of R&D infrastructure of all scopes and in all disciplines. In response to the 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, NSF named a Chi ef Officer for Research Facilities (CORF) in the Office of the Director, responsible for full life- cycle oversight of NSF's major multi -user research facilities. At the request of Congress, the National Science Board (NSB) produced a comprehensive assessment of the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funding and management of such facilities, and the impact of O&M funding on the science enterprise. The first recommendation of the NSB report was that \"NSB and the NSF Director should continue to enhance agency -level ownership of the facility portfolio through processes that elevate strategic and budgetary decision -making.\" NSF responded to this recommendation during FY 2018 by directing a significant portion of the appropriations above the FY 2018 Request toward deferred maintenance and upgrades at major facilities. In FY 2019 and FY 2020, NSF will continue to prioritize the health and balance of its facilities portfolio. Specifically, the agency will initiate a pilot project that reflects NSF's strategic commitme nt to successful O&M. The funds in this activity will be used to (1) partially support initial O&M of new facilities so that the full O&M costs can be gradually absorbed into the managing division or directorate, and (2) partially support divestment of lower -priority facilities , the full cost of which may significantly impact individual division or directorate funding. The tables presented in the Budget Request reflect these priorities for FY 2020. NSF will continue to examine options to provide long -term stability to O&M and th e annual investment of over $1 billion in major facilities at all life -cycle stages. NSF will continue support for the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project. Antarctic facilities are a critical part of the American R&D infrastr ucture and must be modernized to ensure that the Nation has the most up- to-date capabilities. These are vital to guarantee that the U.S. continues to have unimpeded access to Antarctica and to ensure that the discoveries made on the continent can continue for decades to come. In FY 2020, this project will be funded in the MREFC account. Investments in education and STEM workforce are vital to the Nation's continued global leadership. NSF is a leader in federal efforts to: educate and train a workforce for the 21 st century economy; remove barriers to participation in STEM careers; increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM; and promote excellence in STEM education for all learners. Collectively, NSF's Education and STEM workforce programs educate, tra in, and support discoverers, engage citizen scientists, and foster a well -informed, STEM -literate citizenry prepared to handle rapid technological change and pursue STEM careers. NSF continues to prioritize a strong relationship with the private sector. T hrough innovative operational FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 3 constructs like the Convergence Accelerator, and programs like Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), and I -Corps, NSF will continue to support the basic and early -stage applied research that provides the fundamental building blocks of technological advances. Each Convergence Accelerator track is prepared to leverage $20.0 million per year in public - private partnerships. SBIR, STTR, and I -Corps will also continue to empower the p rivate sector to accelerate the transfer of research discoveries. By working to ensure a robust private- public partnership, NSF aims to prioritize lab -to-market initiatives and technology transfer, and to develop an entrepreneurial workforce of STEM profes sionals. NSF's FY 2020 Budget Request is $7.066 billion, a 9.6 percent decrease from the FY 2018 Actual level and a 12.6 percent decrease from the FY 2019 Enacted level Overview Overview - 4 NSF's 10 Big Ideas and the Convergence Accelerator In 2020, NSF will continue t o invest in its 10 Big Ideas and the Convergence Accelerator , which support bold inquiries into the frontiers of science and engineering. These efforts endeavor to break down the silos of conventional scientific research funded by NSF to embrace the cross -disciplinary and dynamic nature of the science of the future. The Big Ideas represent unique opportunities for the U.S. to define and push the frontiers of global science and engineering leadership and to invest in fundamental research. This research will advance the Nation's economic competitiveness, security, and prestige on the global stage. For more information, see the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. About the Big Ideas Six of the Big Ideas are research ideas, which will build on the foundation of NSF -funded research over the last 69 years. The Research Big Ideas are complemented by four Enabling Big Ideas, which are areas in which research endeavors to improve the way in which science is done, from impacting the workforce to developing the infrastructu re that will drive the discoveries and aid the discoverers of tomorrow's science. Research Big Ideas: 1. Harnessing the Data Revolution for 21st-Century Science and Engineering (HDR) \u2014Engaging NSF's research community in the pursuit of fundamental research in data science and engineering, the development of a cohesive, federated, national -scale approach to research data infrastructure, and the development of a 21 st-century data -capable workforce. 2. The Future of Work at the Human Technology Frontier (FW -HTF) \u2014Catalyzing interdisciplinary science and engineering research to understand and build the human -technology relationship; design new technologies to augment human performance; illuminate the emerging socio -technological landscape; and foster lifelong and pe rvasive learning with technology. 3. Windows on the Universe (WoU): The Era of Multi -messenger Astrophysics\u2014 Using powerful new syntheses of observational approaches to provide unique insights into the nature and behavior of matter and energy and to answer so me of the most profound questions before humankind. 4. The Quantum Leap (QL): Leading the Next Quantum Revolution\u2014Exploiting quantum mechanics to observe, manipulate, and control the behavior of particles and energy at atomic and subatomic scales; and devel oping next -generation quantum -enabled science and technology for sensing, information processing, communicating, and computing. 5. Understanding the Rules of Life (URoL): Predicting Phenotype \u2014Elucidating the sets of rules that predict an organism's observab le characteristics. 6. Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) \u2014Establishing an observing network of mobile and fixed platforms and tools, including cyber tools, across the Arctic to document and understand the Arctic's rapid biological, physical, chemical, and soci al changes, in partnership with other agencies, countries, and native populations. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 5 Enabling Big Ideas: 7. NSF INCLUDES \u2014Transforming education and career pathways to help broaden participation in science and engineering. 8. Growing Convergence Research at NSF (GCR) \u2014Merging ideas, approaches, tools, and technologies from widely diverse fields of science and engineering to stimulate discovery and innovation. 9. Mid-scale Research Infrastructure\u2014Developing an agile process for funding experimental research capabilities in the mid -scale range, spanning the midscale gap in research infrastructure. This is a \"sweet spot\" for science and engineering that has been challenging to fund through traditional NSF programs. 10. NSF 2026 Fund\u2014Stimulating and seeding investments in bold foundational research questions that are large in scope, innovative in character, originate outside of any particular NSF directorate, and may require long -term support. This Big Idea is framed around the year 2026, providing an opportunity for transformative research to mark the Nation's 250 th anniversary. About the Convergence Accelerator In the FY 2019 Budget Request to Congress, NSF unveiled the Convergence Accelerator, a new organizational framework that stands separately from the NSF research directorates, with its own budget, staff, and initiatives. Each accelerator track will be a tim e-limited entity focused on specific research topics and themes. The Accelerator will reward high -risk, innovative thinking by multidisciplinary teams of researchers who want to accelerate discovery and innovation. The Convergence Accelerator can be a new way of achieving rapid lab -to-market or research outcomes. Big Ideas and Convergence Accelerator Stewardship Funding Model The fundamental research underlying the Big Ideas has been supported through many NSF programs for a number of years, and in some cases, for decades. The Big Ideas offer a new strategic framework for messaging important grand challenges. FY 2020 Budget Request to Congress will accelerate NSF's progress on the Big Ideas through the following funding models: Research Big Ideas : Each o f the Big Ideas will have a steward, which will be the directorate that oversees budget management and reporting. An investment of $30.0 million is requested for each of the six research Big Ideas. This stewardship funding will support activities across th e agency contributing to support each Big Idea. A total of $180.0 million will be invested across the agency to support the development of the foundational science and technology that will be necessary to propel the Big Ideas forward. These \"stewardship in vestments\" are in addition to the significant, foundational investments already being made by individual NSF directorates and offices in these areas. These additional investments for each of the Big Ideas will support convergent research that transcends tr aditional disciplinary boundaries of individual NSF directorates and offices. The research directions for a Big Idea will be overseen and managed collaboratively by the steward of the corresponding Big Idea and leadership from other participating directora tes and offices. Enabling Big Ideas : The budgets of each these ideas are included in the Integrative Activities, the Directorate for Education and Human Resources or the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account, depending on where the expertise and internal infrastructure exists to ensure success of these endeavors. As with the research ideas, design, direction and implementation are directed Overview Overview - 6 by cross -agency working groups. This investment totals $117.50 million and includes NSF INCLUD ES, Growing Convergence Research at NSF, Mid -scale Research Infrastructure, and the NSF 2026 Fund. Convergence Accelerator : In FY 2020, they will focus on topics shared by two of the 10 Big Ideas. One Accelerator track will focus on Harnessing the Data R evolution for 21st-Century Science and Engineering, and a second will focus on the Future of Work at the Human -Technology Frontier. Each will be funded at $30.0 million, plus each will seek to leverage $20.0 million in external partnerships. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 7 Major Rese arch Equipment and Facilities Construction The FY 2020 Request includes funding to continue construction on two projects: the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS). Funding will begin for two detector upgrades to operate at the High Luminosity- Large Hadron Collider (HL -LHC). Funding for the higher -cost projects ($20 million to $70 million) track of Mid -scale Research Infrastructure will be initiated in MREFC beginning in FY 2020; the track for lower -cost projects ($6 million to $20 million) was initiated in FY 2019 in the R&RA account. The total request to continue construction of these projects, as well as to fund dedicated construction oversight ($1.0 million), is $223.23 million. FY 2018 ActualFY Mid-scale 12.79 - - RCRV 88.00 127.09 - [1.00] 1.00 Total $186.30 $295.74 $223.23MREFC Account Funding, by Project (Dollars in Millions) The AIMS ($97.89 million) construction project will be supported in MREFC. Antarctica makes up nearly nine percent of the continental mass of Earth's surface. NSF manages all U.S. activities as a single, integrated program, making Antarctic research possible for scientists supported by NSF and other U.S. agencies. Funding this infrastructure improvement project will protect U.S. interests on the continent. AIMS will initiate modernization of major facilities at the aging McMurdo Station, much of which was recommended by the U.S. Antarctic Program Blue Ribbon Panel in 2012, so that anticipated science support needs are met for the next three to five decades. AIMS will enable faster, more streamlined logistical and science support by co -locating or consolidating warehousing, skilled trades work, and field science support where field projects are prepared for movement into the field, into four buildings. AIMS will also provide necessary utilities to support these facilities. The LHC ($33.0 million) is the world's largest and highest energy particle accelerator. Located near Geneva, Switzerland and operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the LHC can accelerate and collide counter -propagating bunches of protons at a total energy of 14 tera -electron volts. A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) are two general purpose detectors used by researchers to observe these collisions and analyze their characteristics. In FY 2020, this investment will begin upgrades of components of the ATLAS and CMS detectors that will enable them to function at much higher collision rates following an upgrade to the LHC to would represent year one of a five- year project. The LSST ($46.34 million) will be an 8- meter -class wide- field optical telescope capable of carrying out Overview Overview - 8 surveys of the entire southern sky. It will collect nearly 40 terabytes of multi- color imaging data every n ight to produce the deepest, widest -field sky image ever. It will also issue alerts for moving and transient objects within 60 seconds of their discovery. FY 2020 will be year seven of its nine -year construction funding profile. The Mid-scale Research Inf rastructure ($45.0 million) project has a new, dedicated funding line in the MREFC account. In FY 2020, NSF will implement a high -priority, agency -wide mechanism that includes upgrades to major facilities as well as stand -alone projects, such that research infrastructure investments above $20 million are managed as a portfolio. Individual projects will be selected through a dedicated program solicitation developed in FY 2019 and NSF's merit review process. The FY 2020 Request includes no funding for const ruction of NSF's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), as FY 2019 represented the final year of funding within an 11- year funding profile. Completion of construction is planned for no later than June 2020. The narrative included in the MREFC chapter provides an update on the project's status. The FY 2020 Request includes no funding for construction of NSF's RCRV project, as FY 2019 P.L. 116- 6 appropriated $127.09 million, $98.39 million above the FY 2019 requested amount, which is sufficient funding to complete construction of three vessels. The RCRV project will help to satisfy the anticipated ocean science requirements for the Nation through the construction of three new research vessels. The vessels are a major component in the plan for modernizing t he U.S. Academic Research Fleet. Construction of three ships to support the anticipated demands for coastal oceanography in the Gulf of Mexico and the East and West coasts will minimize transits and maximize research time in each of these regions. NSF plan s to fund the operations of three RCRVs without increasing current annual costs, which is a result of fleet right -sizing and modernization. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 9 Research and Development Budget Priorities In FY 2020, NSF will make investments that support the basic research that advances human knowledge and make tomorrow's innovations possible. Additional investments will support the advancement of AI, research in advanced manufacturing, and advance discove ries in QIS and semiconductors and microelectronics research. In FY 2020, NSF expects that 93 percent of the annual budget will be used to fund research and education grants and research infrastructure in the science and education communities. Basic research forms the core of NSF's work and has led to discoveries and innovations that have been awarded Nobel Prizes, and changed humankind's conception of the universe and known world. In FY 2020, NSF expects to invest $4.53 billion, or 64 percent of NSF's total budget, in basic research. Basic research is responsible for advancing our knowledge of the universe, as well as innovations like high speed internet, nanotechnology, and advances in robotics that require understanding of the fundamental laws that gove rn the physical world. NSF funds basic research in all of the agency's directorates and continues to fund research that transcends a single discipline. Artificial intelligence (AI) ($492 million) is advancing rapidly and holds the potential to transform American lives through improved educational opportunities, increased economic prosperity, and enhanced national and homeland security. NSF investments in AI span fundamental research in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, al ong with the safety, security, robustness, and explainability of AI systems; translational research at the intersection of AI and various science and engineering domains as well as economic sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and personalized medic ine; and education and learning, including growing human capital and institutional capacity to nurture a next generation of AI researchers and practitioners. Advanced Manufacturing ($268 million) investments support the fundamental research needed to revitalize American manufacturing to grow the national prosperity and workforce, and to reshape our strategic industries. NSF research accelerates advances in manufacturing technologies with emphasis on multidisciplinary research that fundamentally alters and transforms manufacturing capabilities, methods and practices. Investments in advanced manufacturing include research on highly connected cyber -physical systems in smart processing and cyber manufacturing systems, and activities that develop new methods, processes, analyses, tools, or equipment for new or existing manufacturing products, supply chain components, or materials. NSF's investments will enable new functionalities that will increase the efficiency and sustainability of the production of the next g eneration of products and services. These developments will yield advantages such as reduced time to market, new performance attributes, improved small -batch production, cost savings, energy savings, or reduced environmental impact from the manufacturing of products. Research in Quantum Information Science (QIS) ($106 million) examines uniquely quantum phenomena that can be harnessed to advance information processing, transmission, measurement, and fundamental understanding in ways that classical approache s can only do much less efficiently, or not at all. NSF will increase support for QIS research and development, which strongly aligns with the Administration's National Strategic Overview for QIS and the National Quantum Initiative to consolidate and expand the U.S.' world- leading position in fundamental quantum research and deliver proof -of-concept devices, applications, tools, or systems with a demonstrable quantum advantage over their classical counterparts. Research in semiconductors and microelectron ics ($68 million) is critical to future advances and security in several areas, including information technology, communications, sensing, smart electric grid, Overview Overview - 10 transportation, health, and advanced manufacturing. NSF will support research to address fundame ntal science and engineering questions on the concepts, materials, devices, circuits, and platforms necessary to sustain progress in semiconductor and microelectronic technologies. The investment will strengthen America's capabilities and capacity for revo lutionary microelectronics design, architecture, and fabrication, as well as high -performance computing. New discoveries will enable the nation to overcome crucial scientific barriers for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum techn ologies, and interconnected autonomous systems, and they will strengthen U.S. scientific leadership, economic prosperity, and national security. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 11 Education and STEM Workforce NSF's education and STEM workforce investments are primarily housed in t he Directorate for Education and Human Resources but represent agency -wide investments in the education of tomorrow's scientists, engineers, and educators. NSF is committed to the education and training of a workforce for the 21st century economy. This wor kforce must be capable of adapting to the increasingly technical nature of work across all sectors. NSF works to prioritize programs that will provide experiential learning opportunities, as well as programs that prioritize computer science education and r eskilling. Priority STEM education activities to prepare America's future workforce in FY 2020 are: The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) ($256.9 million) recognizes students with high potential in STEM research and innovation and provides support for them to pursue research across all science and engineering disciplines. GRFP fellows may participate in Graduate Research Opportunities World wide (GROW), which provides opportunities to conduct research with international partner countries and organizations, and Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP), which provides professional development through research internships at federal agencies. The GRFP program will continue to align awards with NSF research priorities such as Big Data, AI, QIS, and NSF's 10 Big Ideas. In FY 2020, NSF will support 1,600 new fellows. The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) ($93.13 million) initiative supports the development of the STEM and STEM -capable workforce by investing in the improvement of undergraduate STEM education, with a focus on attracting and retaining students and on degree completion. The initiative funds the development and implement ation and the related research and assessment of effectiveness. Directorates across NSF invest in this program to support the development of a workforce that will be able to handle the real -world challenges of a STEM career. The Advanced Technological Education (ATE) ($75.0 million) program focuses on the education of technicians for the high -technology fields that drive our nation's economy. The program involves partnerships between academic institutions and industry to promote improvement in the educati on of science and engineering technicians at the undergraduate and secondary institution school levels. The ATE program supports curriculum development; professional development of college faculty and secondary school teachers; career pathways; and other activities. The CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) ($55.09 million) program supports cybersecurity education at higher education institutions. SFS also focuses on workforce development by increasing the number of qualified students entering the fi elds of information assurance and cybersecurity, which enhances the capacity of the U.S. higher education enterprise to continue to produce professionals in these fields to secure the Nation's cyberinfrastructure. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship ($47.0 million) program seeks to encourage talented STEM majors and professionals to become K -12 mathematics and science teachers through funding provided to institutions of higher education towards scholarships, stipends, and programmatic support. The Loui s Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) ($46.0 million) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the nation's STEM workforce by increasing the number of STEM baccalaureate and graduate degrees awarded to populations historical ly underrepresented in these disciplines. Overview Overview - 12 Computer Science for All (CSforAll) ($20.0 million) will build on ongoing efforts to enable rigorous and engaging computer science education in schools across the Nation, to prepare the STEM workforce of the future. CSforAll aims to provide high school teachers with the preparation, professional development, and ongoing support that they need to teach rigorous computer science courses and to give preK -8 teachers the instructional materials and preparation they need to integrate computer science and computational thinking into their teaching. The NSF ADVANCE ($18.0 million) program increases representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers, thereby contributing to the developm ent of a more diverse science and engineering workforce. ADVANCE is an integral part of the NSF's multifaceted strategy to broaden participation in the STEM workforce and supports the critical role of the Foundation in advancing the status of women in acad emic science and engineering. The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Excellence in Research (HBCU -EiR) ($10.0 million) program supports projects that enable STEM and STEM education faculty to further develop research capacity at HBCUs and to conduct research. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 13 Performance in Support of Renewing NSF and the Big Ideas Renewing NSF With an eye to improving government processes, the Office of Management and Budget issued memorandum M -17-22 in April 2017 requesting that agencies identify opportunities for reform. NSF developed a plan called Renewing NSF. An agency -wide process identified four areas, or \"pillars,\" of greatest opportunity: Making information technology (IT) work for us Adapting the workforce and the work Streamlining, standa rdizing, and simplifying processes and practices Expanding and deepening public and private partnerships NSF's Strategic Reviews in FY 2018 focused on developing the vision and path forward for the four Renewing NSF pillars over the timeframe of the new Strategic Plan. For more information, see the Performance Chapter of this Request. Performance Plan NSF embraces the use of goals to drive performance improvements. For FY 2020, NSF has set performance goals to strategically monitor and oversee progress being made toward its larger aims, including support of the Big Ideas, as well as progress towards the agency reform plan, Renewing NSF. NSF will also assess progress through an annual process of strategic reviews of the objectives in its Strategic Plan. In FY 2020, NSF will monitor the following goals: Ensure that Key Program Investments Are on Track: Ensure that key FY 2020 NSF -wide program investments are implemented and on track. Ensure that Infrastructure Investments Are on Track: Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship of major research facilities and infrastructure. Make Timely Proposal Decisions: Inform applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within 182 days, or six months, of deadline, target , or receipt date, whichever is later. Improve Review Quality: Improve the quality of written reviews of NSF proposals. Foster a Culture of Inclusion: Foster a culture of inclusion through change management efforts resulting in change leadership and accoun tability. Align Job Requirements with Competencies: Ensure that employee job requirements are aligned with competencies and skills needed for the future. Improve User Interactions with IT Systems: Streamline and simplify user interactions with IT systems and functions that support the merit review process, reducing non- value -added steps and reducing the time spent managing the proposal and award lifecycle. NSF will also set Agency Priority Goals in FY 2020 for achievement in FY 2021, which will support areas where focused, cross- cutting effort can produce impactful results in a short timeframe. Overview Overview - 14 NSF by the Numbers NSF by the Numbers: In FY 2020, NSF expects to evaluate approximately 46,100 proposals through a competitive merit review process and make approximately 10,400 new competitive awards, 8,000 of which will be new research grants and the remainder of which will be contracts and cooperative agreements. The number of new research grants decreases by roughly 11 percent from previous levels, in keeping with the overall change in total NSF funding. This process involves approximately 224,000 proposal reviews, engaging on the order of 32,000 members of the science and engineering community participating as panelists and proposal reviewers. In a given year, NSF awards reach over 1,800 colleges, universities, and other public and private institutions in 50 states, the District of Columbi a, and U.S. territories. In FY 2020, NSF support is expected to reach approximately 348,400 researchers, postdoctoral fellows, trainees, teachers, and students. The chart on the right shows the distribution of NSF's obligations by institution type and fu nding mechanism. While the data are based on FY 2018, it is expected that the relative shares in FY 2020 will be similar. As shown on the graph, 95 percent of NSF's FY 2018 projects were funded using grants or cooperative agreements. NSF grants are either standard or continuing awards. That is, the award is made during one fiscal year for the full amount of the award or made over several years in increments. Cooperative agreements are used when the project requires substantial agency involvement during the project performance period (e.g., research centers, major multi -user research facilities). Contracts are used to acquire products, services, and studies (e.g., program evaluations) required primarily for NSF or other government use. Most NSF awards are to academic institutions. As shown in the chart, 77 percent of support for research and education programs ($5,743 million) was to colleges (including two- year and community colleges), universities, and academic consortia. Private industry, including small businesses, accounted for 14 percent ($1,035 million), and support to Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) accounted for four percent ($262 million). Other recipients included federal, state, and local governments; nonprofit organizati ons; and international organizations. A small number of awards fund research in collaboration with other countries, which adds value to the U.S. scientific enterprise and maintains U.S. leadership in the global scientific enterprise. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 15 The chart on the l eft presents a high - level, agency -wide estimate of funding rates, or proposal \"success,\" as a comparison of the number of competitive proposals, new awards, and funding rate between FY 2018, FY 2019, and FY 2020. In FY 2020, NSF expects to make approximate ly 10,400 new awards, which corresponds to a funding rate of about 23 percent. Overview Overview - 16 Organization and Role in the Federal Research Enterprise NSF's comprehensive and flexible support of meritorious projects enables the Foundation to identify and foster bot h fundamental and transformative discoveries and broader impacts within and among fields of inquiry. NSF has the latitude to support emerging fields, high -risk ideas, interdisciplinary collaborations, and research that pushes\u2014 and creates \u2014the very frontiers of knowledge. In these ways, NSF's discoveries inspire the American public \u2014and the world. NSF's organization represents the major science and engineering fields, including: biological sciences; computer and information science and engineering; engineering; geosciences; mathematical and physical sciences; and social, behavioral, and economic sciences. NSF also carries out specific responsibilities for education and human resources, integrative activities, and international science and engineering . The 25- member National Science Board approves the overall policies of the Foundation. NSF's annual budget represents approximately 25 percent of the total federal budget for basic research conducted at U.S. colleges and universities, and this share incr eases to approximately 59 percent when medical research supported by the National Institutes of Health is excluded. In many science and engineering fields, NSF is the primary source of federal academic support. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 17 Highlights For nearly 70 years, NSF has invested in fundamental research and education to fulfill its mission of promoting the progress of science and engineering. In doing so, NSF -supported research has connected the discovery and advancement of knowledge with the potential societal, economic, and educational benefits that are critical for continued U.S. prosperity. Below are a few examples of the important advances that NSF funding enables. New form of light could enable quantum computing Extremely fast quantum computers will require the controlled interaction of light particles called photons. But photons don't naturally in teract with each other. For years, physicists tested ways to encourage photon mingling. The efforts paid off in 2013 when NSF-funded researchers observed pairs of photons interacting and binding together. Now in 2018, the same scientists reported witnessin g groups of three photons melding together. The behavior occurred during an experiment in which a very weak laser beam shone through a dense cloud of ultracold rubidium atoms. Rather than exiting the cloud singly, the photons left in pairs or triplets. The next step is to see if photons can interact in other ways. If successful, they may be harnessed to perform extremely fast, highly complex quantum computations. Robotic float tracks ocean data Southern Ocean data is critical to understanding how carbon dioxide interacts with the polar oceans. However, obtaining that data is challenging because the ocean is one of the world's most turbulent. To overcome this hu rdle, NSF -funded researchers developed an array of robotic floats. Diving and drifting in the waters around Antarctica, the floats collect valuable details and beam their findings back to shore via satellite. A recent study using float data suggests that o pen water nearest the sea ice surrounding the southernmost continent releases significantly more carbon dioxide in winter than previously believed. By increasing the amount of data collected and its specificity, the floats are helping researchers refine carbon dioxide models and understand seasonal and multiyear trends. NSF-funded scientists have coaxed photons to interact, paving the way for their use in quantum computing. Credit: Christine Daniloff/MIT Researchers drop a robotic float into the Southern Ocean. Credit: Greta Shum, ClimateCentral Overview Overview - 18 Highlights NSF -funded research, supercomputer working to develop next generation batteries Large -scale structures such as smart grids and wind turbines require next generation batteries with greater energy capacity than the lithium ion batteries found in today's smaller consumer electronics. One possible solution is lithium -metal batteries, which can store large amounts of energy at a low cost. These batteries have one key flaw, however : they are susceptible to dendritic growth, wherein lithium atoms clump together in the battery over its life cycle, leading to overheating, short -circuiting and even fire. NSF-funded researchers are working to better understand how dendrites form and how new materials can prevent dendrite formation. Using powerful supercomputers, including the NSF -funded Stampede supercomputer operated by the Texas Advanced Computing Center, the re searchers were able to model at the atomic level how a graphene oxide nanosheet, sprayed onto a glass fiber separator inserted into a lithium -metal battery, helped control the flow of ions and slow the build- up of lithium atoms in a battery, thus mitigatin g dendrite growth. Understanding how different coatings impact ion transfer could help researchers develop new materials to enhance the utility of lithium -metal batteries. Artificial Intelligence research inspired by human visual learning accelerates dru g discovery NSF-funded researchers combined nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with artificial intelligence (AI) to more quickly assess the uniqueness of natural compounds, from which new drugs are often derived. The researchers developed a deep learning system, called Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART), that could streamline by 10- fold the process of identifying the chemical structure of new compounds, leading to faster drug discovery. The tool embraces techniques developed fr om an NSF - funded researcher's work on face- recognition and visual expertise. It is an example of biologically -inspired machine learning, which is being used to help researchers analyze structures of new compounds. The Stampede supercomputer has already enabled research teams to predict where and when earthquakes may strike, how much sea levels could rise and how fast brain tumors grow. Credit: University of Texas at Austin's Texas Advanced Computing Center FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Overview - 19 Highlights Advancing new drug therapies with light NSF-funded researchers developed a biosensor that could help advance high -throughput testing for new drug evaluation. Made of a phosphorescen t gel, the biosensor measures oxygen levels for organ -on-a- chip systems; these are small, biological structures that mimic a specific organ function. Monitoring oxygen levels is important because normal levels signal health and abnormal levels signal disease. Until the biosensor, researchers lacked tools to retrieve data from the chip systems in real time. Now, rather than destroying the tissue, researchers can flash infrared light at the biosensor. In response, the sensor emits its own infrared light, depe nding on the oxygen level. Lag times last just microseconds, but with them researchers can measure oxygen concentrations down to tenths of a percent. Training students for the growing unmanned aircraft systems market Through the NSF -funded Geospatial Technician Education- Unmanned Aircraft Systems Faculty Institute, high school teachers and faculty members are learning how to plan and fly manual and autonomous unmanned aircraft system (UAS) missions. The week -long training enables the educators to establish coursework for Virginia's community colleges. Thus far, the project helped five colleges in the Virginia Community College System to offer UAS courses for credit, and three additional colleges to offer non- credit courses. NSF's Advanced Technological Education Program funds the UAS training activity, with the goal of promoting the education of technicians to meet STEM workfor ce demands through faculty professional development, curriculum development and precollege activities at 2-year colleges. More than 200 students completed courses at one school, Mountain Empire Community College. The project seeks to meet the emerging dema nd for trained UAS technicians. In 2013, the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International released a report that projected more than 100,000 new jobs in UAS by 2025. This biosensor tra cks oxygen levels using infrared light. Credit: Kristina Rivera, NCSU/UNC Instruction for faculty participants.

The discovery may lead to a safe and local reservoir of drinking water for communities in need of clean water sources. As utilities in water -stressed regions consider how to direct urban stormwater back into the ground, w ater quality becomes a concern. The coated sand is an inexpensive option for removing many of the contaminants that pose risks to groundwater systems. Although the coating does not remove all pollutants, it can be used in conjunction with other water purif ication systems to remove most impurities. NSF -funded researcher \"transfers\" a memory An NSF -funded researcher reported that his team transferred a memory from one animal to another via injections of ribonucleic acid, or RNA, extracted from the first animal's neurons. The results challenge the way scientists understand where and how the brain stores memories and hints at the potential for new RNA -based treatments to one day restore lost memories or treat post -traumatic stress disorder. The results also indicate that memory storage involves RNA - mediated epigenetic changes, or changes in the activity of genes, and not in the DNA sequences that make up those genes. The findings potentially upset the long -held idea in neuroscience that memories are stored i n the brain's synapses, which convey electrical or chemical signals between nerve cells. Instead, the new research suggests that memories may in fact be stored in neurons' nuclei, a finding that has implications in both the basic sciences and the clinical realm. Engineered sand dest roys toxins \"I think in the not -too-distant future, we could potentially use RNA to ameliorate the effects of Alzheimer's disease or post - traumatic stress disorder,\" said UCLA professor David Glanzman, seen here holding a marine snail.

While broadening participation is included in the NSF review criteria, some program announcements and solicitations go beyond the standard criteria. They range from encouraging la nguage to specific requirements. Investments range from capacity building, research centers, partnerships, and alliances to the use of co -funding or supplements to existing awards in the core research programs. NSF's broadening participation portfolio can be divided into three categories: (1) Focused, (2) Emphases, and (3) Geographic Diversity. The following secti ons define each of these categories and provide a list of the programs and activities with their respective funding levels th at comprise each.

In 2018, NSF issued an updated solicitation, NSF 18 -5372. 1 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17525/nsf17525.htm 2 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18537/nsf18537.htm FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Authorizations - 7 The CS for All: RPP program synopsis in the program solicitation states that: \"This program aims to provide all U.S. students the opportunity to participate in computer science (CS) and c omputational thinking (CT) education in their schools at the preK -12 levels. With this solicitation, the National Science Foundation (NSF) focuses on researcher -practitioner partnerships (RPPs) that foster the research and development needed to bring CS and CT to all schools. Specifically, this solicitation aims to provide high school teachers with the preparation, professional development (PD) and ongoing support that they need to teach rigorous computer science courses; preK -8 teachers with the instructio nal materials and preparation they need to integrate CS and CT into their teaching; and schools and districts the resources needed to define and evaluate multi - grade pathways in CS and CT.\" The revised solicitation added the focus on researcher -practitio ner partnerships that are supporting schools and districts in defining and evaluating multi -grade pathways in CS and CT. Articulation of coursework and experiences in CS and CT from elementary to middle school, middle to high school, and high school into t he first years of college is important to support systemic implementation of CS and CT in schools. Metrics Short -, mid -, and longer -term metrics for success were developed and reported upon, as follows: Short -term metrics will focus on ensuring that the program is making awards in the four areas outlined in the law and that the awards address the goal of broadening participation in computer science. One indicator of broadening participation is the diversi ty of the populations targeted in the awards. Mid-term metrics will include the extent to which funded projects are achieving goals as measured by the progress reported in NSF's required annual and final project reports. Longer -term (beyond five years) metrics will include an evaluation of the outcomes of the program, which are based on the program aims as described in the program solicitation and the well -aligned requirements of Public Law 114- 329. Program staff are working with the Evaluation and Monitor ing group within NSF's Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Evaluation and Assessment Capability group within NSF's Office of Integrative Activities to develop (1) a set of specific longer -term metrics and (2) a program evaluation plan for measuring the collective success of the CS for All: RPP projects using these longer -term metrics. Report on the Success of the Program as Measured by the Short -Term Metrics Between the submission of the last annual report and December 2018, 35 new awards were made by the program : Below is a summary of the CSforAll: RPP projects funded in FY 2018 pursuant to NSF 14 awards address 11 awards address subsection (b)(2) C; and 10 awards address multi -grade pathways to CT and CS Finally, all new awards identified at least one underrepresented or underserved group, as outlined in the table below, to address subsection (b)(2) D.

Specifically, the report itemizes (1) a description of the program strategy and objectives; (2) a description of the awards made in the previous fiscal year including (A) the total amount made available, by state, under EPSCoR; (B) the total amount of agency funding made available to all institutions and entities within each EPSCoR state; (C) the efforts and accomplishments to more fully integrate the EPSCoR states in major agency activities and initiatives; (D) the percentage of EPSCoR reviewers from EPSCoR states; (E) the number of programs or large collaborator awards involving a partnership of organizations and institutions from EPSCoR and non- EPSCoR states; and (3) an analysis of the gains in academic research quality and competitiveness, and in science and technology human resource development, achieved by the program over the last 5 years. Introduct ion EPSCoR utilizes three investment strategies in pursuit of its goal to strengthen research capacity and competitiveness in eligible jurisdictions. These investment strategies are: (1) Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards that support physic al, human, and cyberinfrastructure development; (2) Co- Funding in partnership with NSF directorates and offices that support individual investigators and groups within EPSCoR jurisdictions; and (3) Outreach activities and workshops that bring EPSCoR jurisdiction investigators together with program staff from across the Foundation to explore opportunities in emerging areas of science and engineering aligned with NSF strategic priorities and with jurisdictional science and technology goals. EPSCoR Strategies and Objectives (Sec. 103(d)(1)). c EPSCoR's strategies and objectives in FY 201 8 remain the same as those described in the FY 2017 report. Specifically, the mission of EPSCoR is \"to enhance research competitiveness of targeted jurisdictions (states, terri tories, commonwealths) by strengthening STEM capacity and capability. \" Thus, EPSCoR's goals are: To catalyze the development of research capabilities and the creation of new knowledge that expands jurisdictions' contributions to scientific discovery, innov ation, learning, and knowledge -based prosperity. To establish sustainable Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education, training, and professional development pathways that advance jurisdiction -identified research areas, NSF focus areas, and workforce development. To broaden direct participation of diverse individuals, institutions, and organizations in the project's science and engineering research and education initiatives. To effect sustainable engagement of project participants and partners, the jurisdiction, the national research community, and the general public through data -sharing, communication, outreach, and dissemination. NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 10 To impact research, education, and economic development beyond the project at academic, government, and private sector levels. NSF Funding Made Available, by jurisdiction , under EPSCoR (Sec. 103(d)(2)(A)) . In FY 2018, NSF EPSCoR invested a total of $ 170.59 million in support of its programmatic activities. Of this, $14 2.21 million (83.4 percent) was directed to RII, $27.59 million (1 6.2 percent) to co -funding, and $790,000 (0.4 percent) to outreach activities and workshops.

In FY 2018, NSF invested a total of $ 825.80 million in support of EPSCoR jurisdictions. The table below details NSF investments in EPSCoR jurisdictions including research support funding, education and human resources, and major research equipment. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Authorizations - 11 EPSCoR Jurisdiction NSF Funding AK $45.03 AL 60.14 AR Funding Made Available to All EPSCoR Jurisdictions (Dollars in Millions) Integration of EPSCoR Jurisdictions in Major Activities and Initiatives of the Foundation (Sec. 103 (d)(2)(C)). All EPSCoR programmatic activities target integration and assimilation of EPSCoR jurisdictions into the research and education programs of the Foundation's disciplinary directorates. RII awards promote the coordination and integration of recipient jurisdic tions into major NSF programmatic activities. Additionally, EPSCoR consults and engages NSF disciplinary program officers (PO s) in merit review processes and post -award evaluations, such as site visits and reverse site visits (RSVs). Site visits and RSVs are intended to provide additional project oversight by allowing jurisdictions to report on the progress of their RII projects in relation to their stated goals and the programmatic terms and conditions. Disciplinary POs assist in the identification of reviewers, serve as site visit and RSV observers, and provide knowledge about the ongoing activities within the directorate that could be leveraged to sustain RII efforts after the performance period of the EPSCoR award. National, regional, and jurisdictiona l meetings of the EPSCoR community facilitate grantee interactions with NSF leadership to learn about the Foundation's strategic priorities and funding opportunities. Participation by EPSCoR researchers and educators in the merit review process across all disciplinary NSF Authorizations Authorizations - 12 domains of the Foundation, in Committees of Visitors (COV) activities, in external advisory (Federal Advisory Committee Act) committees, and in disciplinary workshops that shape new activities is also vital to this integration. Outreach to E PSCoR jurisdictions by NSF staff promotes integration of the EPSCoR community into mainstream NSF programs, as does co -funding of awards with the disciplinary programs of the Foundation. There is also an effort to promote in -reach, whereby EPSCoR facilitat es opportunities for researchers and educators from EPSCoR jurisdictions to meet with NSF staff at the Foundation's headquarters. In these meetings, the EPSCoR participants are provided with information on NSF strategic priorities and funding opportunities . In FY 2018, EPSCoR staff promote d engagement of the EPSCoR community in NSF and other national activities. Examples are: Hosted its annual principal investigator meeting, a two -day event with opportunities for the EPSCoR community and NSF program officers to interact and share best practices in strategic planning, diversity, communication, evaluation, and other areas of importance to EPSCoR jurisdictions and NSF. Hosted a half -day session with the EPSCoR Interagen cy Coordinating Committee at the 7 th Biennial National IDeA Symposium of Biomedical Research Excellence in Washington, D.C. This event helped to capitalize on federal agency investments in EPSCoR and EPSCoR -like programs and provided opportunities for interactions and possible new collaborat ions between grantees. Encourage d EPSCoR -supported faculty to participate in NSF committee and review panels across NSF (e.g., COVs, site visits, and merit review panels). Continued the RII Track -2: builds interjurisdictional collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in scientific focus areas consistent with NSF priorities. In addition, these awards have a particular focus on the development of early career/junior faculty. In FY 2018, proposals were invited on the topic of understanding the relationship between genome and phenome, aligned with the NSF Big Idea of Understand ing the Rules of Life, and nine awards were made. Continue d the RII Track -4, EPSCoR Research Fellows solicitation , which provides opportunities for early career researchers to further develop their individual research potential through extended collaborative visits to the N ation's premier private, governmental, or academic research centers. Proposals in all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF were invited and 40 awards were made. EPSCoR Reviewers (Sec. 103(d)(2)(D)). Demographics of all reviewers who evaluated EPSCoR proposals or the program in FY 2018 are as follows: of the 138 reviewers , 25 percent were underrepresented minorities, 38 percent were female, 1 1 percent were from EPSCoR jurisdictions, 65 percent were new reviewers for EPSCoR , and eight percent were new reviewers from EPSCoR jurisdictions. EPSCoR Collaborations and Pa rtnerships (Sec. 103(d)(2)(E)). All RII awards involve collaborations among scientists and engineers in EPSCoR jurisdictions. Additionally, RII awards require institutional collaborations, which are defined as collaborations between researchers at a RII awardee or sub- awardee and those at institutions not receiving any RII funds. In FY 2018, there were 772 EPSCoR 209 collaborations between and in foreign countries. These collaborative FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Authorizations - 13 efforts highlight the vast network of institutional involvement among EPSCoR jurisdictions and their partners in RII projects. Among the 143 awards co -funded by EPSCoR in FY 2018, 82 involved collaborative research between multiple institutions. Of those 82 collaborative awards, 56 were collaborations between investigators from institutions in EPSCoR and non- EPSCoR jurisdictions. An analysis of the gains in academic research quality and competitiveness, and in science and technology human resource development, achieved by the program over the last 5 fiscal years (Sec. 103(d)(3)). Eligibility to participate in NSF EPSCoR programmatic activities is based upon the jurisdictions ' demonstrated ability to obtain NSF research funds. Currently, a jurisdiction is eligible to participate in EPSCoR programs if its level of NSF research support is equal to or less than 0.75 percent of the tota l NSF research and related activities budget over the most recent three- year period. Given EPSCoR's aim to stimulate research that is fully competitive in NSF's disciplinary and multidisciplinary research programs, increases in the ability to capture NSF research funds serve as a proxy for gai ns in research competitiveness. As in FY 2017 , Iowa, Missouri, Tennessee, and Utah exceeded the 0.75 percent threshold and these jurisdictions continued to be ineligible to compete in new FY 2018 RII competitions. In FY 2018, New Mexico also rose above the 0.75 percent eligibility threshold for the first time and became ineligible for RII competitions. New Mexico will continue to receive EPSCoR co -funding and outreach for an additional three years; Iowa, Missouri, Tennessee, and Utah have been ineligible for more than three years, so no longer receive any EPSCoR funding. Figure 1 (below) shows the average amount of NSF research funds by cohort for the initial five years (hatched bars) and the most recent five years (solid bars) of their participation in the NSF EPSCoR Program. A cohort is defined as the group of states or jurisdictions that entered the EPSCoR program within a given fiscal year. For example, the 1980 cohort consists of the initial five states that qualified for EPSCoR: Arkansas, Maine, Montana, South Carolina, and West Virginia. For this summary, the 2000+ cohort consists o f jurisdictions that entered EPSCoR in FY 2000 or later and are still EPSCoR -eligible for RII competitions : Alaska, Delaware, Guam, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Former EPSCoR jurisdictions Iowa, Missouri, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Utah are excluded because they were no longer EPSCoR -eligible in FY 201 8. Each cohort shows an increase in competitiveness over the periods of participation. For example, the 1980 cohort shows a 101 percent increase in NSF r esearch funding over the past 38 years of EPSCoR activity. The 1985 cohort (Alabama, Kentucky, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Vermont, and Wyoming) demonstrates a 76 percent increase during its 33 years of participation in EPSCoR. The 1987 cohort (Idaho, Loui siana, Mississippi, and South Dakota) shows a 101 percent increase over the past 3 1 years, while the 1992 cohort (Kansas and Nebraska) has an 8 9 percent increas e in competitiveness over its 26 years of EPSCoR involvement. Currently eligible j urisdictions p articipating in EPSCoR since FY 2000 entered into the program at a higher level of NSF research funding than the previous cohorts. For the 2000+ cohort, there has been a small, yet demonstrable 15 percent increase in research funding. The data for each jurisdiction is provided in the table immediately after the figure.

This information elucidates the gains in academic research quality over time, as defined by publications, leveraged grants, and patents. For publications, primary support is defined as research that is directly funded by EPSCoR and partial support is defined as use of equipment or facilities funded by EPSCoR. The number and valuation of grants awarded encompass all federal, private industry, and private foundation awards across the U.S. in a given fiscal year for all EPSCoR jurisdictions.

NSF EPSCoR is continuing to refine and implement a cohesive Research Competitiveness evaluation framework for the program. This evaluation, once completed in 2020, will address the legislative objective of increasing the research competitiveness of jurisdictions receiving EPSCoR funding by (1) developing a flexible framework to explore, define, and measure research competitiveness in relation to each unique jurisdictional context, and (2) using evidence of jur isdictional progress toward research competitiveness over time for strategic program improvement. The evaluation builds on the findings and recommendations from the EPSCoR retrospective evaluation completed by the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STPI) in 2012. This new, forward looking contract has been underway since 2017. Key activities to date include identification and merging of data sets, cleaning of data sets, preliminary descriptive and correlational analyses, and refinement of the logic mo del for the research competitiveness framework.

NSF aims to sustain America's leadership in the research, development, and broad deployment of existing as well as new advanced computing technologies, services, and skills \u2014and aims to do so in part through leadership of the all -of-government strategic computing activities previously initiated under the National Strategic Computing Initiative19 jointly with the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, and in concert with other participating federal agencies as well as the p rivate sector. Within the broad goals set for the all -of-government strategic computing activities, key NSF foci include fundamental discoveries to support future generations of advanced computing; research and cyberinfrastructure promoting cohesive platfo rms and interoperability for large -scale data analytics as well as modeling and simulation applications; and support for a comprehensive advanced computing ecosystem for science and engineering research. 20 These foci include an emphasis on a holistic approa ch to America's computational infrastructure for science and engineering research, spanning both human and technical dimensions. The overall NSF advanced computing strategy and program portfolio receives guidance and input from the Advisory Committee for Cyberinfrastructure (ACCI); Assistant Directors (AD) Council, which includes ADs and Office Heads from the various NSF research and education directorates and offices; cross - directorate working group for strategic computing; and directly from the research community through Principal Investigators' meetings, workshops, and sessions at professional conferences.21 In 2013, OAC supported a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study to further inform the implementation of its advanced comput ing strategy in the 2017 to 2020 timeframe; the final report, Future Directions for NSF Advanced Computing Infrastructure to Support U.S. Science and Engineering in 2017- 2020, was published in 2016. 22 In 2017, OAC launched an effort to refresh the vision, s trategy, and investment approaches for cyberinfrastructure, including advanced computing, to support the evolving needs of the science and engineering community,23 and also funded a study seeking to identify and catalog best practices for collaborations between academic or federally -funded High -Performance Computing (HPC) centers and industry.24 In 2018, workshop on \"Future Rethinking NSF's Computational Ecosystem for 21st-Century Science and Engineering.\"25 International activities to accelerate investments in leadership -class computing, particularly in Europe and Asia, are 19 www.nitrd.gov/nsci/ 20 www.nsf.gov/cise/nsci/ 21 See, Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 14 providing additional urgency and importance for this investment strategy to ensure the U.S. maintains its global leadership role in science and engineering. Technological advances come rapidly, and the capabilities and services offered by commercial interests (e.g., cloud) also change rapidly. The requirements of the science and engineering research communities are both heterogeneous and dynamic. To meet these continually evolving needs in an agile yet predictable way, NSF currently invests in three broad and complementary advanced computing areas: Leadership- Class Computing; Advanced/Innovative Computing Systems and Services; and Coordination and Support Services . These resources and services complement each other as well as discipline -specific investments by NSF's directorates, mission -specific investments by other agencies, and cumulatively extensive but individually smaller investments by academic institutions at the regional and campus levels. Specifically: Leadership -Class Computing (formerly Petascale Computing) aims to provide unique services and resources to advance the largest and most computationally -intensive science and engineering research frontiers not otherwise possible; Advanced/Innovative Computing Systems and Services (formerly Innovative HPC Program) aims to provide a technically diverse and potentially future -looking advanced computing portfolio, reflecting the growing and changing use of computation and data in both the research and education processes, and capable of supporting hundreds to thousands of investigators conducting cutting- edge science and engineering research; and Coordination and Support Services (formerly Extreme Digital) aims to coordinate the provisioning, allocation, and operations of NSF's advanced computing resources, providing advanced assistance to the user community, supporting aggregation and federation capabilities, and broadening participation. Leadership -Class Computing Description Leadership -class computing systems have represented a key component of NSF's computational portfolio for decades. NSF's current leadership -class computing resource is Blue Waters, which is deployed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign (UIUC). Since it became operational in FY 2013, Blue Waters has allowed researchers to tackle much larger and more complex challenges than ever before, within and across discipli nes as diverse as biology, astronomy, engineering, materials science, and the geosciences. Despite the success of Blue Waters, this computing resource is reaching its natural end of life and will complete its operational cycle in December 2019. NSF's nex t leadership -class computing system will be the recently -funded Frontera system. Frontera will be deployed by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and is expected to be among the largest central processing unit ( CPU )-based systems in the world and among the most powerful supercomputers ever deployed on a U .S. academic campus when it becomes operational . The system is expected to begin accepting early science and engineering research users in May 2019 and to be fully operational by July 2019. Current Status As noted above, the Blue Waters system is nearing its natural end of life. Following system testing and acceptance in December 2012, and acceptance of the NCSA archival system in March 2013, the Blue Waters project entered a five- year operations phase. The award was granted a no -cost extension in FY 2016 that runs through mid -FY 2019. A second extension granted at the end of calendar year 2018 will allow the system to operate through December 2019, enabling a seamless transition from Blue Waters to the recently - awarded Frontera system at TACC. With the extension of the operational end date of Blue Waters through 2019, the system will have run for roughly three years longer than the typical lifetim e for a system of this type, providing excellent return on federal investment. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 15 In anticipation of the operational end date of Blue Waters in FY 2016, NSF developed a plan for a phased approach to support a next -generation, leadership -class computing system . This plan was discussed with the National Science Board (NSB) in FY 2017, and in May 2017, NSF issued a competitive solicitation26 for the first phase (Phase 1) of a two- phase plan to deploy a new leadership -class computing facility. The solicitation called for a Phase 1 system that would be two to three times more powerful in application performance than Blue Waters. The system acquisition was awarded in FY 2018, and will be followed by a separate award for an operations and maintenance (O&M) phase, anticipated to commence in FY 2019 and last for five years. Following the Phase 1 solicitation and associated review process of the submitted proposals, NSB at its July 2018 m eeting authorized the Director at her discretion to make an award to the TACC for the acquisition of the Frontera system in an amount not to exceed $60.0 million over a period of five years. The resolution also authorized that, pending appropriate approval associated with NSF's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) policies, an additional amount not to exceed $8.0 million may be made available to TACC in the form of supplemental funding to this award to advance the design of the Phase 2 leadership- class computing system. NSF issued an award to the University of Texas at Austin for the acquisition of Frontera in September 2018. When deployed, the Frontera system will offer the highest scale, throughput, and data analysis capabilities ever deployed on a university campus in the U.S. TACC is building the supercomputer, with the primary computing system provided by Dell EMC and powered by Intel processors. Through its primary CPU subsystem, Frontera will offer more than five times greater capacity than the previous leadership -class NSF - funded computing system. In addition, Frontera's graphics processing unit (GPU) will accelerate discoveries in dynamic research areas such as deep learning and molecular dynamics. The system will also allow science and engineering evaluation to inform the design of a future leadership- class computing facility. Science and engineering research and education activities enabled by Leadership -Class Computing Leadership -class computing systems enable investigat ors across the country to conduct innovative research that is not otherwise possible due to demanding technical requirements. Over its lifetime, the Blue Waters project has supported more than 700 project teams, the majority of them through the highly competitive NSF Petascale Computing Resource Allocations (PRAC) program. The research topics that the PRAC program supports include: complex biological behavior in fluctuating environments; electronic properties of strongly correlated systems; properties of hy drogen and hydrogen -helium mixtures in astrophysically - relevant conditions; electronic and magnetic structures of transition metal compounds; molecular dynamics responsible for the properties of liquid water; and propagation of seismic energy through a det ailed structural model of Southern California together with prediction of ground motion and modeling of the response of buildings and other structures. Other allocations address testing hypotheses about the role of cloud processes and ocean mesoscale eddy mixing; formation of the first galaxies; turbulent stellar hydrodynamics; binary black hole and neutron star systems as sources of gamma ray bursts; and other intense radiation phenomena, contagion, and particle physics. For the transition period between B lue Waters and Frontera, NSF has issued a Dear Colleague Letter 27 accepting applications for supplements to active NSF research awards for time on both systems. Education and outreach projects are ongoing; they target pre -college, undergraduate, graduate, and post - graduate students. The Blue Waters project also sponsors workshops, conferences, summer schools, and seminars. The project includes industry partnership activities as well. The Industry Partners in Petascale Engagement program provides industry pa rtners across a wide range of market sectors (e.g., health, energy, 26 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17558/nsf17558.htm 27 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19030/nsf19030.jsp Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 16 advanced manufacturing) with expertise as well as a first look at the technological and scientific developments that flow from the petascale program.

Managemen t and Oversight The Blue Waters and Frontera projects are overseen by OAC's program directors and BFA 's Division of Grants and Agreements staff, who receive strategic advice from the AD Council. Advice from the NSF Office of General Counsel is also sought, as necessary. The NSB receives updates on any major changes in risk assessments, which are reviewed annually by an external panel. Risks identified during the operational phase of a project include system security, power costs, and performance/reliability/usability due to large system scale. Advanced/Innovative Computing Systems and Services Description NSF funds the acquisition and operation of nationally- available Advanced/Innovative Computing Systems and Services that, in aggregate, are forward -looking and technically diverse, and reflect changing and growing use of data -intensive computation in both the research and education processes. At the same time, they are intended to enable discoveries at a computational scale beyond the reach of an individual or regional academic institution. Deployed systems serve as a cohesive set of allocable resources within the eXtreme Digital (XD) integrated services infrastructure, which is described in the following section. Advanced/innovative computing systems and services awards are generally made as two parts: an acquisition and deployment award that may be the result of a competitive or a renewal proposal; and a separate award for operations and maintenance following deployment. When an awa rd is made, the awardee institution issues sub -awards to vendors and/or other organizations for acquisitions and services as necessary. Expenditures are contingent on successful completion of deployment milestones. Current Status Four resources, Wrangler , Comet, Bridges, and Jetsream , commenced operations in FY 2015 and FY 2016, and the capabilities of Comet, Bridges, and Jetstream have been augmented since initial deployment. In FY 2018, the period of operation for these four systems was extended, as not ed below, allowing for increased return on investment and ensuring continuity of operations for the research community. Stampede 2, the largest of the currently active HPC resources within this portfolio, commenced operation in FY 2017. NSF will continue t o diversify its portfolio of advanced/innovative computing systems and services to address the evolving and broadening needs of the research community. Deployed in FY 2015, Wrangler is the most powerful data analysis system allocated in XD, with 10 petab ytes of replicated, secure, high -performance data storage. This innovative system consists of 3,000 embedded processing cores for data analysis; 120 Intel Haswell -based servers for data access and embedded analytics; and a large- scale flash storage tier fo r analytics, with bandwidth of one terabyte per second and 275 million Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS). Wrangler provides flexible support for a wide range of software stacks, including Hadoop and relational data. Support for ongoing Wrangler ope rations and maintenance continues through October 2019, and is provided to UT Austin at a level of approximately 20 percent of the initial acquisition cost per annum, consistent with the level specified in the FY 2013 FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 17 Innovative HPC program solicitation.28 Wrangler's 275 million IOPS capabilities remain at the leading edge of currently deployed systems in production operations; the extension provides for continuing operations at that performance level. Comet also came online in FY 2015 at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). It supports research interests and priorities requiring large, high -throughput workloads, which in turn prompt massive amounts of computation but at moderate scalability. Notably, as a resource responsive to the \"long tail of science,\" Comet is particularly well -suited for the large -scale computational needs of research community portals such as Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research as well as distributed workflows such as those required by the Laser Interferometer Gra vitational- Wave Observatory. Comet's heterogeneous configuration supports not only complex simulations but also advanced analytics and visualization of outputs. As a result of its role in machine learning, visualization, and advanced analytics, supplementa l funding was provided to increase the GPU component of Comet in FY 2017. Comet is planned to remain operational through March 2021. Bridges came online in FY 2016 at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Bridges provides an innovative and groundbreaking HPC and data analytics system integrating advanced memory technologies to empower new communities. It brings desktop convenience to HPC, connecting to campuses, and intuitively integrating data -intensive wo rkflows to increase the output of a large community of scientific and engineering researchers that has not traditionally used HPC resources. Bridges extends the impact of HPC to EPSCoR jurisdictions and Minority- Serving Institutions, raising the level of c omputational awareness at four -year colleges, and promoting computational thinking in high -schools. Bridges was augmented with GPU nodes in FY 2018 and will remain operational through November 2020. Jetstream also came online in FY 2016 at Indiana University. Jetstream is a cloud -based platform that incorporates the best elements of commercial cloud computing resources with some of the best software for solving important scientific problems. Jetstream enables new modes of sharing data and computational analysis, allowing for increased scientific reproducibility and enabling American scientists and engineers to make new discoveries that are important to understanding the world around us, thereby improving the quality of life for all Americans and promoting t he nation's competitive standing in the world. Jetstream's system operation was augmented in FY 2017 to provide additional focused staff expertise to accelerate effective researcher utilizations of the programmable cyberinfrastructure/virtual machine- enabl ed architecture. The system will continue operations through November 2020. In FY 2016, NSF awarded Stampede 2: The Next Generation of Petascale Computing for Science and Engineering to UT Austin following a rigorous merit review, enabling the acquisitio n, development, and deployment of Stampede 2 as a successor resource to the highly successful Stampede system. Stampede operated from 2013 through 2017 and was considered the \"backbone\" for the XD environment, annually supporting more than 5,000 res earcher s and more than 1,000 computationally -intensive projects across the Nation. Stampede 2 similarly serves as the primary national resource (i.e., the \" workhorse \") for thousands of American academic researchers, complements other national advanced computing systems and services, and provides capabilities beyond the reach of individual campuses and regional resources, including support for multiscale modeling, simulation, and data -intensive research. Stampede 2 has been deployed into production operation throug h three phases: (1) the Intel Knights Landing many- core nodes were deployed in 2017, demonstrating increased performance at lower power rates; (2) the highly complementary Intel SkyLake processors, which are responsive to data- intensive computing, were in early operations in 2017 and fully deployed as a peak 18 -petaflop system in 2018; and (3) the final deployment phase, also in 2018, introduced persistent memory to the previously- deployed Skylake processors to significantly enhance 28 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13528/nsf13528.htm Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 18 overall system performan ce. Stampede 2 will serve the high -end, open science community through November 2022. As noted above, Wrangler, Comet, Bridges, and Jetstream are all scheduled to ramp down operations during FY 2020 through FY 2021. During the same period, Stampede 2 will continue at full operation and the new leadership -class computing system, Frontera, will ramp up to full operations to ensure continued support for the science and engineering research community. Moving forward, NSF envisions that investments in advanced/ innovative computing systems and services will foster an integrated cyberinfrastructure ecosystem that addresses the growing scale and diversity of the science and engineering community, the changing nature of science and engineering research requirements, and the rapidly evolving technology and services landscape, with the overarching goal of supporting the full range of computational - and data - intensive research across all science and engineering domains. To further this goal, NSF issued a solicitation for advanced computing systems and services in FY 2019 with anticipated awards spanning FY 2019- FY 2024. 29 This solicitation calls for investments in two categories: Category I, Capacity Systems: production computational resources maximizing the capacity provided to support the broad range of computation and data analytics needs in science and engineering research; and Category II, Innovative Prototypes/Testbeds: innovative forward -looking capabilities deploying novel technologies, architectures, usage modes, etc., and exploring new target applications, methods, and paradigms for science and engineering discoveries. The solicitation will remain in effect through FY 20 20, allowing for two cycles of submissions and awards. Science and engineering research and education activities enabled by Advanced/Innovative Computing Systems and Services The ecosystem of advanced/innovative computing systems and services is enabling new, world- leading, and transformative advances across the breadth of science and engineering research, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening participation in science and engineering by underrepresented groups. It is enabling new collaborations across public and private sectors to advance American security and economic competitiveness. These advances are made possible by providing researchers and educators with usable access to world -leading computational systems and services, together with expertise, beyond that typically available on most campuses, including the interfaces, consulting support, and training necessary to facilitate use of the systems and services. This activity is central to America achieving the full potential of c omplementary investments by NSF, other federal agencies, and academic institutions. Management and Oversight OAC's program directors provide direct oversight during both the acquisition and operations and maintenance awards. Formal reporting consists of quarterly and annual reports, which are reviewed by the program directors. Awards for advanced/innovative com puting system and services are managed under cooperative agreements that include the management structures, milestones, spending authorization levels, and review schedules. Each awardee is responsible for the satisfactory completion of milestones prior to NSF authorization of spending. Progress is assessed with the aid of annual external reviews. In addition, each project is required to have a project management plan. Any activity of this nature, and at this scale, comes with a certain element of risk. Th e review process, conducted prior to award, analyzes the risks as presented in the proposal and identifies any additional risks that should be considered. During the award process, risks are identified and analyzed, and a mitigation 29 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19534/nsf19534.htm FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress CISE - 19 plan is created and fol lowed. One of the activities of the periodic NSF external reviews, conducted by an external panel of experts, is to revisit and reassess the risk situation and make recommendations as deemed necessary. In the case of projects that involve an acquisition, t ypically, project risks are substantially reduced subsequent to deployment. Thus, the pacing of the acquisitions and deployments for such projects provides balance in the overall risk portfolio for the program. Milestone -driven reviews occur during the ac quisition award, typically with an external review prior to deployment. Annual reviews, conducted by an external panel of expert reviewers and managed by OAC program directors, are performed during the operational phase of each project. Coordination and Support Services Description NSF's investments in coordinaton and support services, as exemplified by the XD integrated services infrastructure, add value to the NSF advanced/innovative computing systems and services by coordinating the systems and services, providing advanced assistance to the user community, and b roadening participation. The XD program's shared services model for coherently and efficiently delivering to researchers both access and expertise to diverse, dynamic, and distributed resources is a cornerstone of the American advanced computing, including HPC, ecosystem. Enabling the connection between individual campuses and national resources is an essential aspect of the advanced computing ecosystem. XD enables and supports leading -edge scientific discovery and promotes science and technology education . The program encourages innovation in the design and implementation of an effective, efficient, increasingly virtualized approach to the provision of high- end digital services, while ensuring that the infrastructure continues to deliver high- quality access for the many researchers and educators who use it in their work. XD shared services consist of several interrelated parts: allocation of resources to computational and data research projects; advanced user assistance; training, education, and outreach; architecture and operation of an integrated digital services infrastructure; metrics services; and overall coordination. These elements are designed and implemented in a way that is clearly tied to the requirements of the science and engineering research community, using a flexible methodology that permits the architecture to evolve in response to changing community needs and that presents individual users with a common environment regardless of where the resources or researchers are located. Current Statu s Two awards are currently active within the XD program: XD Metrics Service (XMS) and the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). The smaller XMS award was made in FY 2015 to The State University of New York at Buffalo . This award pr ovides metrics services allowing measurement of key operational data for both resources and services. All other services are provided by XSEDE. The XSEDE award to UIUC was renewed in September 2016, continuing the prior XSEDE award for another five -year period. The award will conclude at the end of August 2021, and in anticipation of that date, NSF has initiated engagements with the community about the structure and composition of future coordination efforts. Within the current XSEDE project, there are 18 partners engaged via subawards to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (National Institute for Computational Sciences), CMU and University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh Supercomputing rsity of Chicago, Indiana University, Purdue University, Shodor Education Foundation, Ohio Supercomputer Center, Southeastern Universities Research Association, Cornell University, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Georgia Institute of Technology, Oklahoma State University, University of Georgia, Oklahoma University, University of Southern California, and University of Arkansas. Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE - 20 The mid -project external site review of the XMS project took place in June 2018 and continued operations were authorized based on the successful outcome of that review. XSEDE has annual external reviews at NSF. The first external review of the renewed XSEDE project took place in June 2017; subsequent external milestone reviews have taken place in January and June 2018. On th e basis of these successful reviews, funds have been authorized for operations through the third year of the five -year award. Science and engineering research and education activities enabled by Coordination and Support Services Coordination and support services, as exemplified by XD, enable transformative advances in science and engineering research, in the integration of research and education, and in broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. These advances are accomplished by providing researchers and educators with coherent and highly usable access to extreme- scale digital resources beyond those typically available on most campuses, together with the interfaces, consulting, advanced user support, and training necessary to facilitate their use. XD coordinates access to advanced/innovative computing systems and services and enables researchers to efficiently manipulate, analyze, visualize, and share extremely large amounts of distributed digital information from simulations, sensors, and experiments. XD's XSEDE project delivers tools and services that not only link users to national facilities, but also enable scientific collaborations of geographically distributed teams. In doing so, it facilitates dynamic access to digital resources and experimental testbeds within and across university campuses, as well as government laboratories. The XSEDE project includes outreach and training critical to reducing barriers to the use of advanced digital systems by the r esearch and education communities, thereby promoting enhanced productivity. XD's XMS project develops analysis tools and collects operational data from XD projects such as XSEDE and the advanced computing/innovative systems and services. The immediate use rs of these methods and tools are the providers of NSF -supported advanced computing systems and services. However, both tools and data are publicly available and used by other projects such as Blue Waters, Frontera, and individual universities. Management and Oversight OAC's program directors oversee the XD projects. XSEDE has an external advisory board, a user board, and a service provider forum to ensure that all stakeholders can provide project input. OAC oversight of the XSEDE project includes particip ation in weekly teleconferences with senior XSEDE personnel and in quarterly project -wide staff meetings. Formal reporting consists of quarterly and annual reports, which are reviewed by the program directors. Each XD award is managed under a cooperative agreement that includes requirements for a specific management structure, milestones, reporting of spending levels over time, and a review schedule. Each awardee is responsible for the satisfactory completion of milestones prior to NSF authorization of spending. In addition, each project is required to have a detailed management plan in place. While XD is operational in nature, the virtual organizations of the XSEDE project and the services of all XD projects a re innovative and thus bear inherent risks. The projects maintain risk registers that are reviewed periodically by external panels and by the cognizant program directors. Annual reviews for XSEDE and mid- project reviews for XMS are conducted by external panels of expert reviewers and managed by OAC program directors.

In FY 2020, funding for centers accounts for over nine percent of ENG's non- SBIR/STTR Request. In FY 2 020, f unding for facilities is just under two perce nt of ENG's non -SBIR/STTR Request. In FY 20 20, the number of competitive proposals received, which includes SBIR/STTR proposals, is expected to be about 10 ,000, which includes about 7,500 research grant proposals . In FY 2019, ENG implemented the removal of all deadlines associated with unsolicited \"core\" programs across the directorate , which is expected to produce a reduction in the total number of proposals received and allow for increases in both award size and duration. Program Monitoring and Evaluation External Program Evaluations and Studies: In FY 2015, NSF funded the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) to study the future of center -based, multidiscip linary engineering research. The study report ,2 delivered May 2017, articulates a vision for the future of NSF -supported center -scale, multidisciplinary engineering research. After careful consideration, in FY 2018 ENG sparked new convergence engineering research collaborations through planning grants, providing 60 awards to build capacity for a new generation of engineering research centers. In October 2018 , ENG released a solicitation for the 4th generation of ERCs (NSF 19 -503) and anticipates awards in 2020. Since 2016, the PFE:RED program has engaged a Participatory Action Research team (REDPAR) composed of two partners: the Center for Evaluation & Research in STEM Equity (CERSE) from the University of Washington and the Making Academic Change Happen (M ACH) group from the Rose - Hulman Institute of Technology. REDPAR has collected data from a variety of sources for evaluation and assessment examining the partnerships that teams are creating along with the project results/ outputs . The group has been providi ng feedback and briefings on a regular basis and will produc e a summative report in the 2019-2020 timeframe. To date, ENG has used the data collected to change the language in RED solicitations to emphasize key areas that were not appropriately addressed in the proposals being received. For example, the FY 2019 solicitation includes a new track, the RED A&I (Adaptation and Implementation) track, that focuses on the use of evidence -based and evidence generating change strategy approaches and actions that are adapted to the local context of implementation. In FY 2016, NSF initiated a rigorous evaluation of the I -Corps Teams program. The evaluation seeks to assess the impact of the program on teams that completed the entrepreneurial training. In addition, NSF seeks to understand the impact of the program on academic culture, such as the kinds of networks and connections principal i nvestigators develop with industry and investors and how their research and other activities are impacted by the I -Corps experienc e. The analysis relies on quantitative data from surveys and case studies developed from in- depth interviews and site visits. A report is expected to be available in FY 2019. In FY 2017, the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) became law and required NSF to develop metrics to evaluate the I -Corps program and to deliver a report to Congress every two years. NSF has completed development of the metrics, prepared the first report, and plans to submit it to Congress in spring 2019. In FY 2018, t he SBIR/STTR Baseline Monitoring Survey was cleared by the Office of Management and Budget. The survey consists of two parts: Company and Founder. The aim of the survey is to learn more about these small businesses shortly after they receive their first NS F SBIR/STTR Phase I awards. Some of the metrics collected in the survey include: technology readiness, R&D efforts, university affiliations, payroll and revenue, as well as NSF lineage. The survey allows ENG to create a performance baseline for these small businesses, benchmark internally across cohorts, understand what 2 www.nap.edu/catalog/24767/a -new -vision -for-center -based -engineering -research FY Request to Congress ENG - 7 best-in-class small businesses do differently, and identify root causes for low performers so NSF can design tailored improvement initiatives for the SBIR and STTR program s. ENG is admi niste ring surveys to small businesses who received their Phase I award in 2018 and 2019. In FY 2019, the data collection and management process for the Industry -University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) program is migrating from North Carolina State Univer sity to NSF. One of the overarching goals of this migration process involves building an in- house data ecosystem for the IUCRC program that entails collecting, organizing, and managing internal and external data , including data from an annual survey . The combination of data sources will provide a holistic view of the IUCRC program and enable customized analyses and insights to be made on a c enter level. Workshops and Reports: In FY 2016, CBET, EFMA and others co- funded a three -year study on Grand Chall enges in Environmental Engineering by the National Academies .3 The study aimed to identify high -priority challenges for environmental engineering and science for the next several decades. The three planned public workshops associated with the study were he ld May 2017; September 2017; and January 2018. The report ,4 delivered in December 2018 at a 500- person event , will shape the growth of university departments, inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists to address the most pressing global envir onmental challenges, and improve the training of environmental engineers and scientists to better meet these challenges. It will also help inform NSF program directors of emerging areas for research. In addition, t he Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) will convene a special session during their 2019 biannual meeting on the Grand Challenges for Engineering. With ECCS support, a workshop on Microsystems for Bioelectronics Medicine organized by NSF and the Semiconductor Res earch Corp. (SRC) was held in April 2017. The organizing committee included extensive representation from other federal agencies ( Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , Department of the Army, Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health [NIH] ) and pharmaceutical and other companies (such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Philips, Intel, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, IBM, and Texas Instruments). The workshop helped identify scientific areas for future investment in ECCS core programs and le d to an NSF -SRC -IARPA solicitation on Semiconductor Synthetic Biology for Information Processing and Storage Technologies (SemiSynBio) (NSF 17 -557), 5 with awards in FY 2018. In FY 2017, ENG (CBET and EFMA) and BIO co- funded a workshop on \"The Subterranean Macroscope: Sensor networks for understanding, modeling, and managing soil processes,\" held November 2017, at the University of Chicago. The workshop's goal was to create a vision and framework for how such a subterranean sensor network could be built across different geographical scales, with sensors that will generate dense, useful data that will inform soil science, plant science, and modeling efforts. These efforts, in turn, would lead to the next level of understanding of the physical, chemical, and bi ological nature of soil and its impact on plant science and food security. The workshop included diverse scientists and engineers and representatives from industry and the small business community. The workshop was expected to generate cross- directorate research opportunities advancing measurement system capabilities for soil biological, chemical, and physical components over space and time and to contribute to several of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. The workshop led to the multi -directorate NSF Dear Colleague Letter on Signals in the Soil (NSF 18-047) 6 in FY 2018 and the NSF solicitation on Signals in the Soil (NSF 19 -556)7 in FY 2019; collaborating with NSF in FY 2019 are the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Instit ute of Food and Agriculture www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505577&org=NSF Directorate for Engineering ENG - 8 arms of the U nited Kingdom's Research and Innovation.

Program Monitoring and Evaluation External Program Evaluations and Studies: In FY 2018, EAR funded a three -year study on Catalyzing Opportunities for Research in Earth Sciences by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) . This study will identify high research priorities for the division. The first public meeting took place in November 2018. The Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) program, which ended in FY 2017, was assessed , with the final report delivered in FY 2018. The evaluation under sponsorship of GEO Directorate for Geosciences GEO - 4 and OIA included the following tasks: (1) examin ing the effectiveness of SEES, (2) complet ing a historical review of NSF's sustainability efforts in the past 15 years, and (3) review ing the SEES portfolio solicitations from 2010 to 2014. The contractor's analyses produced interesting findings, including: Collaboration intensity of SEES teams is higher than that of non- SEES teams for collaborations within the research community, and the difference is statistically significant. This suggests that the SEES funding mechanism was particularly effective in creat ing dynamic networks of interdisciplinary collaborators as measured by the density of ties among experts on all NSF awards won during the full study period. Overall, the SEES funding mechanism was more successful than the non- SEES funding mechanism in attr acting investigators from a different discipline. The larger team sizes supported by the SEES funding mechanism seemed to create more opportunity for the inclusion of social scientists and education researchers. SEES awards enriched the quality of educati on in science across all levels\u2014 from kindergartners to senior citizens \u2014through a myriad of events for students, totaling over 453 educational -focused products or activities across the country and internationally, including lab tours, science fairs, and the promotion of careers in science. SEES principal investigators (PI s) have published in a large number of multidisciplinary journals. They raised the visibility of and interest in sustainability research as implied by the high citation counts of their publi cations. Workshops and Reports: The OCE is sponsoring a facilitated workshop in FY 2019 titled \"Future of Marine Seismic Capabilities Workshop\" to address plans for 3 -Dimensional and deep crustal seismic data acquisition for NSF - funded basic research in t he marine geosciences after retirement of the NSF -owned Research Vessel Marcus G. Langseth in late calendar 2020. Committees of Visitors (COV): In 2018, COVs reviewed Geospace programs in the AGS and the Integrative Programs Section in OCE. The COV reports were presented to the GEO Advisory Committee at their October 2018 meeting. In its report, the COV looking at geospace programs recommended that programs consider sustainability of early career researchers, and recommended that a future COV examine the long -term effectiveness of supporting CubeSats. In 2019, COVs will review facilities and infrastructure in AGS and research programs in OCE. In 20 20, a COV will review lower atmospheric research , infrastructure, and education programs in AGS.

The programs in MPS span from individual investigator awards to large, multi- user facilities. MPS -funded science spans an enormous range as well: from the smallest objects and shortest times ever studied to distances and times that are the size and age of the universe. Individual investigators and small teams receive most awards, but centers, institutes, and facilities are all integral to MPS -funded research. The MPS FY 2020 Request is influenced by four key priorities: (1) sustaining core research programs, (2) supporting the hig hest priority facilities, (3) supporting early -career investigators, and (4) providing funding for targeted basic research in NSF -Wide Investments, including the NSF Big Ideas. MPS continues to support its core areas of science (astronomical sciences, ch emistry, materials research, mathematical sciences, and physics) as well as thet next generation of scientists. Early -career investigators continue to be a priority, and are supported via the CAREER program, MPS core programs, and by crosscutting programs in which MPS participates. MPS is the steward of funds designated for NSF Big Ideas: QL and WoU. These convergent activities will enable pursuit of fundamental research in quantum -enabled sciences and technologies and multi -messenger astrophysics. By expl oiting quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and squeezing, the QL activities will develop the foundations for and enable quantum computing, quantum sensors, quantum communications, quantum simulators, and other inherently quantum technologies. In addition, these activities will contribute to the development of the nation's workforce in quantum information sciences. The WoU activities will bring together fundamental research in electromagnetic waves, high -energy particles, and gravitational waves; advance the study of the universe; and grow the N ation's multi- messenger astrophysics, engineering, and data science workforce. For more information about the NSF Big Ideas, see the NSF -Wide Investments chapter.

In FY 2020, SBE expects to award approximately 900 competitive grants, including an estimated 550 research grants Program Monitoring and Evaluation Workshops and Reports: In FY 2018, NCSES funded a 27- month study by Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies). The study will have two components: (i) a panel study on transparency and repr oducibility for NCSES statistics, and (ii) a workshop on the implications of convergence for measuring the S&E workforce and the S&E enterprise. The desired objective of the consensus panel is to enable NCSES to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of NSF's statistics by and for data users and to facilitate improvement of the statistical program workflow processes of the agency and its contractors. The results are expected to help NCSES improve its processes for producing indicators from its surveys and from blended data sources, and to help data users better understand and apply NCSES data. The desired objective of the workshop is to identify and discuss issues in measuring \"convergence\" and consider the implications of these issues for the S&E work force and, more broadly, for the overall S&E enterprise. The results of the workshop are expected to improve NCSES's ability to take account of convergence in its statistical programs. The start -date for the grant was September 2018; the results from the w orkshop and the panel study are expected to be delivered in 2020. As part of an existing SES -managed award, partially funded by NCSES, the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) of the National Academies conducted a Consensus Panel Study to assess the NCSES approach to measuring the S&E workforce. The final report 2 from the study, which was delivered to NCSES in January 2018, spelled out several recommendations intended to improve the Center's ability to examine emerging S&E workforce issues while also allowing for stability in the estimation of key trends. Included 2 www.nap.edu/catalog/24968/measuring to Congress SBE - 5 among the Panel Study's recommendations were suggestions: (i) to accelerate the Center's efforts in developing sample designs that would facilitate the generation and analysis of longitudina l data on S&E workers; (ii) to enhance survey data related to the need for and acquisition of S&E skills and training; and (iii) to conduct research on optimal contacts, response modes, and incentives to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Cent er's S&E workforce surveys program. In response to recommendation (i), NCSES has developed longitudinal weights for its National Survey of College Graduates and has incorporated a longitudinal design into its Survey of Doctorate Recipients with plans to di sseminate longitudinal data after the 2019 survey cycle. For recommendation (ii), NCSES has begun assessing the quality and accessibility of administrative data sources to supplement the labor market data collected in its surveys. In response to recommenda tion (iii), NCSES has conducted research examining data collection approaches to develop an optimal contact strategy for each of its surveys. In response to requests for increased granularity in graduate student enrollment data, NCSES conducted an evaluation of its Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS). This evaluation included workshops with GSS stakeholders to determine data needs, studies to evaluate options for expanding the analytical capabilities of the surv ey, and site visits with educational institutions to determine the feasibility of collecting additional information. The result of this evaluation is the successful implementation of an improved GSS data collection effort that allows for the separate analy sis of master's graduate student and doctoral graduate student enrollment data. In the past, it was not possible to use GSS data to examine graduate student enrollment by degree level. Committees of Visitors (COV): In 2019, COVs will review BCS and SMA.

Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences SBE - 10 OISE - 1 OFFICE OF INTERNATIO NAL SCIENCE $46,240,000 AND ENGINEERING (OISE) -$2,740,000 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual About OISE OISE is the focal point for NSF's international science and engineering activities. OISE's mission is to promote an integrated, Foundation- wide international engagement strategy and manage internationally - focused programs that are innovative and catalytic. OISE focuses on international activities to promote innovation for U.S. researchers through access to international knowledge, infrastructure, and capabilities. OISE's FY 2020 Request supports this by focusing on three activities: (1) promoting the development of a globally engaged workforce, (2) facilitating and supporting international partnerships, and (3) providing opportunities for U.S. leadership to shape the global science and engineering agenda. In FY 2018, OISE launched the Accelerating Research through International Networks (AccelNet) program through a call for white papers, funded four workshops, and released a solicitation for funding in FY 2019. The goals of the AccelNet program are to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepar e the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations. The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to t ackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts. The program seeks to foster high -impact science and engineering by providing opportunities to create new collaborations and new combinations of resources and idea s among linked global networks. At the FY 2020 Request level, OISE will release a modified solicitation using lessons learned from the FY 2019 competition. OISE expects the FY 2020 solicitation to use new mechanisms for the international research community to accelerate discovery through network -to-network collaboration. In FY 2020, AccelNet will focus on NSF -priority investment areas , including NSF's Big Ideas . Each AccelNet award will build a network of networks across international and interdisciplinary boundaries. AccelNet will provide the funding to connect U.S. research networks with their international counterpart networks. These efforts will ensure the United States has access to the best ideas, people, and facilities wherever they may be. In FY 2020, OISE will continue to expand opportunities for STEM undergraduate and graduate students through the International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program. The IRES program supports the development of a diverse, globally- engaged U.S. science and engineering workforce. The IRES program supports active research in all disciplines of research funded by NSF. Given the increasingly global nature of science and engineering, the long -term goal of IRES is to enhance U.S. leadership by developing the next generation of STEM leaders. In FY 2020, IRES will continue to focus on three tracks. Track I focuses on the development of world- class research skills in international cohort experiences. Track II is dedicated to targeted, intensive learning and training opportunities that leverage international knowledge at the frontiers of research. Track III calls for U.S. institutional partnerships and coalitions to develop and evaluate innovative models for high -impact, large -scale international research and professio nal development experiences for graduate students, as individuals or groups. In FY 2018, NSF launched MULTIPLIER \u2014MULTIPlying Impact Leveraging International Expertise in Office of International Science and Engineering OISE - 2 Research Missions. MULTIPLIER replaced NSF's static international strategy of maintai ning three overseas offices. MULTIPLIER expeditions focus on fields of science and engineering where researchers are making significant developments and have the potential to benefit U.S. prosperity, security, health, and well-being. MULTIPLIER expands NSF 's commitment to international outreach by: Identifying emerging scientific research areas worldwide through a collaborative survey approach; Providing subject matter experts and international specialists to apply analytic approaches and diplomatic connect ions to leverage international capabilities that may benefit the U.S.; Organizing short -term missions for information gathering, ground truthing and network building; and Preparing analysis on country- and discipline -specific insights, as well as reports a nd presentations. In FY 2020, OISE will support the Partnerships in International Research and Education (PIRE) program through continuing awards. PIRE is an NSF- wide program that funds international research opportunities for U.S. investigators across al l NSF -supported disciplines. PIRE also supports high quality research and education that could not occur without international collaboration. PIRE seeks to catalyze a higher level of international engagement in the U.S. science and engineering community . The PIRE program is currently paused for submission of new proposals. The release of a new solicitation is anticipated for FY 2021, with funding in FY 2022. OISE co -fund with NSF directorates on meritorious proposals that include international collaboration through its Global Venture Fund. OISE will provide support to assure that U.S. researchers contribute to, and benefit from, complementary efforts around the globe. In FY 2019, OISE will contribute to the NNA and QL NSF Big Idea s. In FY 2020, OISE will continue supporting NNA at a level of $1.0 million, which will support research that builds on and extends existing observing networks and scientific knowledge as well as logistics support expertise to address the convergent scien tific challenges in the changing Arctic. Interagency, state government, and international partnerships will be further developed to achieve pan -Arctic and Arctic -global perspectives. In FY 2020, OISE will invest in QL at a level of $1.0 million. The Quantum Leap Big Idea will continue to build upon and extend the existing knowledge of the quantum world, fostering breakthroughs in the fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena and enabling the exploitation of these phenomena to disrupt the Nation's science and engineering landscape. These advances will unleash the potential of the Nation's quantum -based scientific enterprise, economy, and security.

AccelNet funds network -to-network collabor ations and not research , so while the total number of competitive proposals will increase, t he number of research grant proposals is expected to decrease by 55 percent compared to the FY 2018 Actual Estimate . OISE expects to award about 40 research grants from the IRES program. The decrease in the number of expected research proposals in FY 2020 is attributed to the pause of the PIRE program. Program Monitoring and Evaluation External Program Evaluations and Studies: An evaluation of the IRES program beg an in September 2018 and will produce deliverables at various stages of the evaluation. The evaluation is expected to be completed in early 2021. The evaluation will review educational and career trajectories of principal investigators and students and the extent of their international engagement as a result of participating in the program . The final results are expected by Fall 2021. Workshops and Reports: In FY 2018, five workshops were funded through the AccelNet program to stimulate the exchange of ideas and leverage international resources. Committees of Visitors (COV): December 2017, a COV convened to review OISE 's programs and activities. The COV chair presented the report to the NSF International Science and Engineering Advisory Committee January 2018. OISE responded to the COV 's recommendations in February 2018.1 Spring 2018, a COV reviewed awards to the Nationa l Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) Board on International Science Organizations (BISO). BISO's mission is to strengthen science for the benefit of society through U.S. leadership, collaboration, and representation i n international scientific organizations and initiatives. BISO provides information about these international scientific organizations and initiatives to the leadership of the National Academies, NSF, the Department of State , and other organizations.

In the Arctic, NSF helps coordinate research planning as directed by the Arctic Research Policy Act of 1984, and the NSF Director chairs the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) created for this purpose. In the Antarctic, per Presidential Memorandum 6646, NSF manages all U.S. activities as a single, integrated program, making Antarctic research possible for scientists supported by NSF and by other U.S. agencies. The latter include the National Aeronautics and S pace Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Smithsonian Institution, and the Department of Energy. The U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) research activity supported by NSF also supports leadership by the U.S. Department of State in the governance of the continent and Southern Ocean under the aegis of the Antarctic Treaty System. OPP supports investments in research and education and provides support for research infrastructure, such as permanent stations and temporary field camps in the Antarctic and the Arctic, including support for NSF Big Ideas\u2014N NA, WoU, and UR oL. OPP's FY 2020 Budget Request is influenced by three key priorities: (1) supporting critical facilities that enable frontier research in the Earth's polar regions; (2) maintaining strong disciplinary programs that provide a base for our investments in cross- disciplinary system science programs ; and (3) maintaining U.S. research community activities in polar system scie nce. These priorities reflect opportunities for fundamental scientific discovery uniquely possible in polar regions, as well as Office of Polar Programs OPP - 2 studies to investigate the causes and future trajectory of environmental and ecosystem changes now being observed at the poles t hat could impact global systems. This work will implement the Foundation's lead- agency role in facilitating the Nation's investment in polar science. In addition to shared cross -directorate basic research objectives, OPP investments will be guided by recent sponsored studies to identify priority areas and ensure effective polar research programs: For the Arctic, IARPC's Arctic Research Plan: FY 2017 -20211, and the World Meteorological Organization's Year of Polar Prediction Implementation Plan2 inform sci ence investment priorities. Efforts to build an integrated research capacity to address the potential opportunities and challenges of Arctic change for the Nation's security and economics and well -being of Arctic residents will continue. For the Antarctic, the 2015 National Research Council report A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research3 inform s science investment priorities. Specifically, in 2018, OPP initiated support of a five -year deep -field program to study the Thwaites Glacier region that was the highest priority in that study. The Thwaites program is jointly supported, including shared logistics, with the National Environment Research Council of the U.K. Major Investments OPP will support science in both polar regions and the major ramp up in the construction tempo of the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project. AIMS commenced in 2019 as a MREFC project to address major recommend ations by the USAP Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) report, More and Better Science in Antarctica through Increased Logisti cal Effectiveness. 4 The project is expected to be completed within 10 years from its award. In FY 2020, OPP will support research at $80.16 million. OPP will continue to support existing priority commitments, including the Thwaites Glacier progra m, and Arctic observing that received strong endorsement at the Arctic Science Ministerial, as well as new awards . Education activities across OPP will be through Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site s. OPP's investment in Antarctic Facilities and Operations will be $192.14 million. Most of the reduction compared to FY 2018 is due to a one -time investment in 2018 dedicated to replacement of the aging pier at Palmer Station in the Antarctic peninsula with funding above the Request provided from Congress . OPP will continue to support the three LTER sites and IceCube at their 2018 levels of funding . The AIMS project design will be fully funded by the end of FY 2019; no further design funding is anticipated after that.

These funds were carried over into FY 2018, and supported awards made in FY 2018 ($15.03 million). EHR is responsible for the management of this program. 1 In FY 2017, HBCU-EiR was funded at $10.0 million within the Integrative Activities budget. These funds were carried over into FY 2018, and supported awards made in FY 2018 ($20.15 million). The FY 2020 Budget Request for IA is $491.04 million. This request highlights NSF's continuing emphasis on building capacity across the U.S. research and education enterprise. About IA The IA budget is managed by the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA), which consists of three sections : Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Evaluation and Assessment Capability (EAC), and Integrative Act ivities. Through its IA investments, NSF incubate s new ideas and communities, support s innovation in research and NSF's own processes, and promote s integration across research and education domains. IA enhance s the competitiveness of the Nation's research through activities that build capacity for science and engineering (S&E) and broaden participation in research and education. IA expands NSF's capability to gather and use evidence about the progress and impact s of its programs; and as S&E increasingly evolves towards transdisciplinary, convergence- style research and IA catalyzes new cross- cutting programs . Integrative Activities IA - 2 IA provides NSF stewardship for several of NSF's 10 Big Ideas: Growing Convergence Research ( GCR), Mid-scale Research Infrastructure, and NSF 2026, as well as the NSF Convergence Accelerator activity. These novel programs support , respectively , innovative team science that crosses traditional domain boundaries, cutting -edge instrumentation, the ideation of broad research themes, and use- inspired, translational research. IA enhance s the capacity of jurisdictions, institutions, and individuals to conduct globally -competitive research. IA's jurisdictional and institutional capacity -based programs include EPSCoR, NSF's Historically Black Colleges and Universities Excellence in Research (HBCU -EiR) program, the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program , and Mid- scale Research Infrastructure. The Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) and the p restigious STEM honorary award program, the Alan T. Waterman award, are designed to grow the capacity of the U.S. research enterprise by investing in emerging talent. IA supports the Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships (STC) program , a center -scale program that promotes discovery and innovation through collaborative research and knowledge transfer . FY 2020 Activities NSF Convergence Accelerator Through a n organizational structure called the NSF Convergence Accelerator ( NSF C-Accel), NSF will continue to pilot a novel, phased approach to identifying, nurturing, and funding use -inspired research, moving ideas from discovery into practice. The first two research topics \u2014(1) workforce skilling and reskilling, and ( 2) open data sharing \u2014are derived from previous research in two of NSF's 10 Big Ideas, FW-HTF and HDR , which are well aligned with Administration priorities. NSF C-Accel will facilitate convergence and translational activities in these areas, especially by creating and leveraging external partnerships. To select the first cohort of PIs for each topic, a dear colleague letter issued in February 2019, will seek propo sals for Phase 1 awards to be made in FY 2019. These awards would support six months of idea refinement, team -building, and preliminary research, culminating in a first round of pitches by spring 2020 for the next phase of support focused on building prototypes, developing experimental designs and other deliverables, as appropriate. For more information about NSF C-Accel , see the narrative in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. Evaluation and Assessment Capability EAC will continue the systematic and rigorou s generation of evidence and facilitate its timely use to strengthen NSF's position as a leader in the evaluation and assessment of investments in S&E research, education, and infrastructure. With the support and advice of an agency- wide steering group of assistant directors and office heads, and a working group of program directors, EAC will: harness high- quality evidence to inform organizational learning and support the achievement of organizational objectives ; employ timely recommendations from cost -effective, contracted evaluations; and strengthen NSF's use of evidence in decision -making to achieve its mission . EAC will also work with programs to facilitate the development of continuous improvement frameworks , which can be used to guide program implementation and evaluation by identifying milestones and metrics to monitor progress. EAC will continue its collaboration with the OIRM Division of Information Systems (DIS) to enhance data quality and access. This collaboration is also making available machine learning tools for portfolio analyses and identifying reviewers for use by NSF staff. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress IA - 3 Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research EPSCoR investments assist NSF in its statutory function \"to strengthen research and education in the sciences and engineering, including independent research by individuals, throughout the United States, and to avoid undue concentration of such research and education.\" Facilit y Operation Transition The Facility Operation Transition is a pilot program that re flects NSF's strategic commitment to successful operations and maintenance (O&M) of new major facilities as well as balancing portfolio funding between facilities and investigator research, both of which were emphasized in the NSB's Congressionally request ed 2018 report entitled \"Study of Operations and Maintenance Costs for NSF Facilities\" (NSB -2018 -17).1 NSB envisioned a more flexible MREFC account as one way to achieve these goals; owing to the challenges that would be introduced by maintaining separate construction and operations funding in the MREFC line, the recommended strategic funding is requested in the R&RA account instead. The funds in this activity will be used to (1) partially support initial O&M of new facilities so that the full O&M costs can be gradually absorbed into the managing division or directorate, and (2) partially support divestment of lower -priority facilities, the full cost of which may significantly impact individual division or directorate funding. A total of $10.0 million is requested in FY 2020 for this program . For more information about Facility Operation Transition , see the discussion in the overview of the Facilities chapter. Graduate Research Fellowship Program GRFP supports the training of tomorrow's leaders in the resear ch community. Funding for GRFP is evenly split between IA and EHR. NSF's FY 2020 GRFP funding will support 1,600 new fellows. Information on recent evaluations of GRFP may be found in the Major Graduate STEM Education narrative in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter. Growing Convergence Research The GCR activity , as one of the enabling Big Ideas, supports basic research on novel, challenging, transdisciplinary questions. The unifying characteristics of these undertakings are that: (a) if successfully answered, they are likely to have a large impact, either on fundamental understanding in S&E or on our ability to meet pressing societal challenges, or both; and (b) they require the integration of knowledge, tools, and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. GCR also aims to grow the next generation of convergence researchers. In FY 2020, GCR investments will support ten to twelve exploratory research collaborations and up to four capacity- building activities . For more i nformation about GCR, see the narrative in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter.

The preparation of the project report is underway, and results are anticipated in FY 2019. This study is co- funded with ENG. SaTC. This study build s on STPI findings from a review of historical data from early investments in cybersecurity core programs from 2008 to 2011. The primary emphasis of th is evaluation is on data from the inception in FY 2012 of SaTC , an NSF cross -cutting program, to the pres ent. An understanding of how and in what ways SaTC makes collective progress toward its talent development goals and objectives will inform the use of these findings to refine existing and future SaTC program level activities. Data collection has begun , and initial findings will be presented to NSF in spring 2019. Final results are anticipated before the end of FY 2020. This study is co -funded with CISE. Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI). The purpose of this comprehensive assessment is to understand how the CCI program achiev es its stated goals. Of particular interest is an understanding of the nature of collaborative practices in the centers . The results of this study will be used to communicate how the program functions and to strengthen its design and operation. Preliminary reporting of findings from analyses of agency administrative data and publication records is underway. Results are anticipated in FY 2019. This study is co- funded with MPS. EPSCoR. The purpose of this evaluation is two- fold: (1) to develop a flexible framework to explore, describ e, and measure research competitiveness in relation to the unique contexts of each EPSCoR jurisdiction; and (2) to collect and use evidence of jurisdictional progress toward research Integrative Activities IA - 6 competitiveness over time for strategic program improvement. An understanding of how and in what ways progress is made towards increased research competitiveness will inform the use of these findings to refine EPSCoR program -level activities. The final project planning activities have been completed and the study team is finalizing the framework and proposed data analyses. Results are anticipated in FY 2020. This study is co- funded with EPSCoR. In 2018, two evaluations were completed, and their reports were submitted to NSF: Geoscience Education (GeoEd). This evaluation describes the extent to which the GeoEd portfolio is contributing to and progressing toward the achievement of pr ogram goals. The purpose of this evaluation was three -fold: (1) to develop a flexible framework to define, measure, and explore value and outcomes ; (2) to provide evidence of the range, synergies, and variability of factors contributing to impact over time ; and (3) to strengthen the practice of evaluative inquiry for program improvement among GeoEd decision- makers and stakeholder s. The results are being used to develop a strategic plan . The evaluation concluded in August 2018 with a final report and presentation delivered to internal NSF stakeholders. EAC staff facilitated a review of the report and incorporation of findings in a strategic visioning process that conclude s in March 2019. This study was co- funded with GEO. Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES). This evaluation examined the extent to which the SEES portfolio achieved its goals as measured by: (1) the creation of new knowledge and conceptual understandi ng; (2) the existence and enhancement of productive connections between and among researchers across disciplines; and (3) the creation of a workforce able to handle future sustainability challenges. The study , which compares SEES projects with non- SEES pro jects, found that the SEES projects were successful in bringing together multiple perspectives and developed more extensive principal investigator ( PI) networks. SEES PIs found that dissemination and outreach also yielded new research ideas. Evaluation a nd Assessment Capability Related Activities In the spring and early summer of 2018, EAC participated in NSF's Strategic R eview (SR) proces s, in which federal agencies assess their progress towards on their strategic objectives. EAC staff co -lead one SR, on developing a Learning agenda for NSF INCLUDES. Learning agendas are a systematic approach to engaging stakeholders in asking questions with answers that yield evidence to inform decision- making and policy action to enhance perf ormance of programs and other organizational units, including the agency as a whole. The NSF INCLUDES Learning Agenda Strategic Review laid the groundwork for the development of a learning agenda on which EAC began working at the start of FY 2019, in colla boration with EHR. The other four SRs covered the four pillars of Renewing NSF and were facilitated by EAC. In FY 2019, EAC will continue to support the implementation of Renewing NSF by leading the monitoring and assessment of progress. FY 2019 EAC rel ated activities include the ongoing projects described above. In addition: EAC will focus on gathering evidence to describe the implementation of two of NSF's 10 Big Ideas, NSF INCLUDES and GCR, as well as NSF C-Accel. The evidence thus generated will be used to inform day- to-day opera tions and performance improvement as these activities mature. EAC will also continue to monitor the progress of Renewing NSF. EAC, in collaboration with NSF's Office of Diversity and Inclusion, has begun to investigate the requirements for a potential monitoring system to understand the effects of NSF's policy on sexual harassment, announced in September 2018. In FY 2020, the GRFP, SaTC , and EPSCoR projects will continue, as will the work focused on NSF's 10 Big Ideas and NSF C-Accel. EAC will also lead NSF's response to the forthcoming OMB guidance and enable implementation of the requirements of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (FEBP, P. L. 115-435). In FY 2020, EAC will engage in new collaborative evaluation projects in accordance with NSF's priorities. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress IA - 7 Workshops and Reports: In FY 2018, with the National Institutes of Health and other agencies, NSF co-funded studies by the National Academies on: The role of inducement prizes in spurring innovation.

In general, about 12 percent of the EPSCoR portfolio is available to support new research grants. The remaining 88 percent support s grants made in prior years. EPSCoR uses three strategic investment tools: Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards, Co - Funding, and Outreach/Workshops. Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) RII awards will continue to support development of physical, human, and cyber -based research infrastructure i n EPSCoR jurisdictions with emphasis on collaborations among academic researchers, the private sector, and state and local governments to effect sustainable improvements in research infrastructure. These awards are designed to improve the research competit iveness of jurisdictions by strengthening their academic research infrastructure in areas of science and engineering supported by NSF and critical to the particular jurisdiction's science and technology initiatives. RII awards also invest in workforce deve lopment, increase the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, enable broader regional and topical collaborations among jurisdictions, and facilitate the enhancement of discovery, learning, and economic development of EPSCoR jurisdictions. Co-Funding EPSCoR co -invests with NSF directorates and offices on meritorious proposals from individual investigators, groups, and centers in EPSCoR jurisdictions that are submitted to the Foundation's research and education programs, including crosscutting ini tiatives. Outreach and Workshops The Outreach and Workshops component of EPSCoR solicits requests for workshops, conferences, and other community- based activities designed to explore opportunities in emerging areas of science and engineering, and to shar e best practices in strategic planning, diversity, communication, and other capacity -building areas of importance to EPSCoR jurisdictions. EPSCoR also supports outreach travel that enables NSF staff from all directorates and offices to directly engage and inform the EPSCoR research community about NSF opportunities, priorities, programs, and policies.

L. 101- 609), to establish the national policy, priorities, and goals necessary to construct a federal program plan for basic and applied Arctic scientific research. USARC advises the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee in developing national Arctic research projects and a five-year plan to implement those projects. USARC also supports interaction with Arctic residents, international Arctic research programs and organizations, and local institutions, including regional and local governments, in order to obtain the broadest possible view of Arctic research needs. USARC is an independent federal agency, funded through NSF's appropriation, specifically as an activity in the Research and Related Activities account. USARC is requesting $1.5 24 million , $90, 500 above the FY 2018 Actual . In FY 2020, new leases will be established for both USARC offices (in Arlington, VA, and in Anchorage, AK) by the General Services Administration. The FY 20 20 Request provides funds to advance Arctic research, and to recommend Arctic research policy that is consistent with the Administration's FY 20 20 Administrative Research and Development Budget Priorities (M-18-22). The FY 2020 Request will support three FTE funded at USARC. In addition, the FY 2020 Request supports one full -time contractor and four part -time contractors.

To accomplish this, EHR invests in the development of people and knowledge. Progress in STEM depends on the education of discoverers\u2014innovators and futur e leaders in the N ation's science and engineering (S&E) enterprise. These discoverers are critical members of the STEM and STEM-related workforce, including public and private sector, academic, policy, research, and teaching occupations. The progress of S& E also depends on a public that can take full advantage of STEM- shaped employment opportunities of the future, and values and participates in STEM (e.g., through formal and informal education, public participation in scientific research, and civic engagement). Importantly, the opportunities made possible by f ederal investments in STEM must be provided effectively to \u2014and draw from \u2014the full and diverse talent pool of the Nation. EHR plays a vital role in attaining these objectives. EHR is a leader in f ederal efforts to: prepare the STEM workforce for the future; remove barriers to participation in STEM careers; increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM; and promote excellence in STEM education for all learners across the life -course. EHR is responsible for careful stewardship of public funds that support the development of the N ation's human capital in STEM. EHR awards provide funds that support traineeships, fellowships, research experiences, reskilling and upskilling professional development, and a wide range of institutional capacity building programs. Collectively, these programs educate, train, and support discoverers; engage citizen scientists; and foster a well -informed, STEM -literate citizenry prepared to handle rapid technological change and pursue STEM careers. Uniquely in the f ederal context, EHR programs also fund the discoveries \u2014the crucial foundational research and the design and implementation studies \u2014that underpin these STEM human capital development initiatives. Just as NSF's R&R A directorates are dedicated to funding basic research that accelerates progress in S&E, EHR supports early- stage, exploratory research that enables improvements in STEM Directorate for Education and Human Resources EHR - 2 education, learning, and assessment. Each decade brings new challenges, new learnings, and new opportunities to enhance STEM learning \u2014and as scientists and engineers make new discoveries, education must adapt to the new skills and knowledge necessary for our nation to stay on the cutting -edge of scientific advances. Knowledge arising from EHR's research portfolio informs EHR's human capital initiatives and a suite of NSF-wide investments in undergraduate and graduate STEM education and broadening participation. Importantly, results, data, and innovations arising from EHR -supported research are also available to catalyze discoveries and inform investments at scale made by other agencies, organizations, and the private sector. In the preK -12 realm, for example, EHR invest s in research that yields focused, catalytic contributions to push the f rontiers of effective learning and practice in formal education and informal learning environments. In the area of professional workforce development, EHR invests in research that can advance and accelerate efforts to reskill and upskill the workforce in a reas where STEM disciplines and skills converge. Across learner populations, EHR invests in research to develop the theories and provide vital evidence to inform STEM education innovation and improvement. Collectively, EHR's research investments provide th e knowledge capital that underpins a broad spectrum of STEM education initiatives \u2014at NSF, f ederally, in schools and institutions of higher education, online, and in libraries, museums, and other learning contexts across the country. EHR's research and hum an capital investments are coordinat ed across three thematic areas: STEM lear ning and learning environments, broadening participation and institutional capacity, and STEM prof essional workforce development. These themes are consistent with the three aspir ational goals highlighted in the federal government's five - year strategic plan for STEM education, Charting a Course for Success: America's Strateg y for STEM Education : (1) build strong foundations for STEM literacy; (2) increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM; and (3) prepare the STEM workforce for the future. 1 EHR's thematic areas also provide a framework for coordinating EHR's contributions to NSF's 10 Big Ideas and identifying opportunities to deepen and strengthen syn ergies with the R&RA directorates. EHR's FY 2020 Budget Request is shaped by support for several of NSF's 10 Big Ideas . To increase diversity, equity and inclusi on in STEM, EHR will steward the NSF INCLUDES Big Idea , contributing basic, design and development , and implementation research. EHR will also coordinate the participation of other federal agencies and private sector partners in NSF INCLUDES . EHR's steward ship of NSF INCLUDES will incubate and widely disseminate successful models of engaging and retaining populations traditionally underserved in the STEM disciplines \u2014in particular, minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. In addition to NSF INCLUDE S, EHR will contribute to the HDR, FW-HTF, and NNA Big Ideas in FY 2020. As part of the HDR Big Idea, EHR will collaborate with other directorates and offices to make essential contributions to research on how to create and nurture a 21 st century data -capable workforce. Through investments from the Division of Undergraduate Education, EHR will continue advances in curriculum and pedagogy of data science . EHR investments will spur discoveries to foster lifelong learning and pervasive learni ng through technology as part of the FW -HTF Big Idea. Learners must be empowered to take advantage of the transformatio ns to society and work that have resulted from new technologies. EHR will foster discoveries to expand digital platforms and develop new cyberlearning systems to engage all learners in the STEM skills necessary for the workforce of the future. Lastly, EHR will participate in the NNA Big I dea which introduces questions about how to train the next generation of scientists to work at 1 www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/STEM -Education -Strategic -Plan-2018.pdf FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress EHR - 3 the intersection of social science, natural science, engineering, and economics, creating a laboratory for learning research in convergent spaces. EHR's investments will contribute to the development of a new generation of convergent thinkers and continue to advance innovative ways to engage the public in the research developed through the NNA Big Idea. For m ore information on NSF's 10 Big Ideas and other prioriti es, see the NSF -Wide Investments chapter . EHR staff continue to provide cross -agency leadership to the Federal Coordination in STEM Education Task Force and the associated i nteragency working groups .

EHR's evaluation priorities include ensuring the efficient use of available administrative data assets and coordinating evidence- building and us e across NSF's STEM education, workforce , and broadening participation programs. External Program E valuations and Studies : In FY 2018, EHR initiated a third- party evaluation of the ADVANCE program. In February 2019, EHR supported a workshop entitled Essential questions and measures: Assessing institutional transformation of undergraduate STEM education the results of which will inform future plans to evaluate the IUSE program. EHR tentatively plans to complete an assessment of the Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP) in FY 2019. EHR expects insights from this assessment will inform future evalua tions of related initiatives (e.g., the INTERN supplemental funding opportunity that since FY 2018 has supported non-academic research internships to improve graduate student preparedness for the STEM workforce). In November 2018, EHR completed a collabor ative project with the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) to update the Common Guidelines for Education R esearch and Development 2 (jointly released in 2013). A supplement, the Companion Guidelines on Replication & Reproducibility in Education Research , was issued in November 2018 to \"highlight the importance\" of reproducibility and replication studies in education research and \"provide cross -agency guidance on the steps investigators are encouraged to take to promote corroboration, ensure the integrity of education research, and extend the evidence base.\"3 In FY 2020, EHR will complete a systematic plan for addressing priority questions releva nt to the directorate's STEM human capital development programs and continue to review existing data assets and assess how they can be leveraged for monitoring and evaluative purposes. In FY 2020 and beyond, EHR -based infrastructure and processes will con tinue to be developed in collaboration with the NSF Evaluation and Assessment Capability, as appropriate. Additionally, EHR experts in evaluation will continue to collaborate with other federal agencies engaged in STEM education program evaluation as a means of sharing best practices, developing tools for portfolio and data analysis, working toward the use of common metrics and instruments, building collaborative expertise for STEM education evaluation across agencies, and accomplishing the objectives for operating with transparency and accountability set -out in the f ederal government's five- year strategic plan for STEM education, Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education. EHR will employ evidence from these and other ongoing eval uations and monitoring initiatives to inform future EHR -program decision- making. Committees of Visitors (COV): In 2015, EHR began a transition from COVs focusing on individual programs to division- wide COVs that comprehensively examine all programs in the relevant division. All four EHR divisions have now transitioned to this new model. In late 2018, COVs reviewed the Division of Graduate Education (DGE) and the Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE). Those COVs are expected to present their reports to the EHR Advisory Committee at its spring 2019 meeting. In fall 2019, a COV will review the Division of Research on Learning (DRL). 2 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13126/nsf13126.pdf 3 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19022/nsf19022.pdf?WT.mc_id=USNSF_179 Directorate for Education and Human Resources EHR - 6 In 2020, a COV will review the Division of Human Resource Development (HRD).

FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress EHR - 15 H-B NONIMMIGRANT PET ITIONER FEES $120,000,000 In FY 2019, Petitioner Fees are FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 EstimateFY 2020 RequestFY 2020 Request Change Over FY 2019 Estimate Beginning in FY 1999, Title IV of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) of 1998 (P.L. 105- 277) established an H -1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury for fees collected for each petition for alien nonimmigrant status. That law required that a prescribed percentage of funds in the account be made available to NSF for low -income scholarships; grants for mathematics, engineering, or science enrichment courses; and systemic reform activities. In FY 2005, Public Law 108- 447 reauthorized H -1B funding. NSF was provided with 40 percent of the total H -1B receipts collected. Thirty percent of H -1B receipts (75 percent of the receipts that NSF receives) are to be used for a low-income scholarship program, Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S -STEM). Ten percent of receipts (25 percent of the receipts that NSF receives) are designated for support of private- public partnerships in K -12 education through Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST). The FY 2020 Request includes a legislative proposal to double the ACWIA fee for the H -1B visa program (to $3,000 per worker for large employers and $1,500 for small employers) to prepare American workers for jobs that are currently being filled by foreign workers, especially in STEM fields. Under the proposal, NSF's allocation for the ITEST program (10 percent) would remain the same, while its allocation for S-STEM would decrease from 30 percent to 15 percent, a level that would maintain absolute funding levels under current estimates. Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S -STEM). The S -STEM program began in 1999 under P.L. 105- 277. Originally , the p rogram was named Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) and supported grants for scholarships to academically -talented students with demonstrated financial need pursuing associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degrees in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics. Grantee institutions awarded scholarships of up to $2,500 per year for two years to eligible students. The CSEMS activity continued under the American Competitiveness in th e 21 st Century Act (P.L. 106-313) with a prescribed percentage of H -1B receipts (22 percent) which totaled approximately 59.5 percent of the total H -1B funding for NSF. P.L. 106- 313 also amended P.L. 105- 277 by increasing the maximum scholarship duration t o four years and the annual stipend to $3,125. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108- 447), the prescribed percentage of H -1B receipts available for the low -income scholarship program was increased to 30 percent (approximately 75 percent of the total H -1B funding for NSF). E ligibility for the scholarships was expanded from the original fields of computer science, engineering, and mathematics to include \"other technology and science programs designated by the Director.\" The maximum annual scholarship award amount was raised from $3,125 to $10,000. Language also was added allowing NSF to use up to 50 percent of funds \"for Directorate for Education and Human Resources EHR - 16 undergraduate programs for curriculum development, professional and workforce development, and to advance technolo gical education.\" As a result, the program was renamed in 2006 from CSEMS to S -STEM. Low-income Scholarship Program: S -STEM. The S -STEM program provides institutions with funds for student scholarships to encourage and enable academically talented U.S. stu dents demonstrating financial need to enter the STEM workforce or STEM graduate school following completion of an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The program emphasizes the importance of recruiting students to STEM disciplines, mentoring and supporting students through degree completion, and partnering with employers to facilitate student career placement in the STEM workforce. Since its inception, the low -income scholarship progra m has received more than 7,000 proposals from all types of colleges and universities and has made 2,017 awards. In addition to scholarships, S -STEM awards also provide funding for student support activities featuring close involvement of faculty, student m entoring, academic support, curriculum development, and recognition of student accomplishment s. Such activities are important in recruiting and retaining students in high -technology fields through graduation and into employment. In FY 2020, in addition to the long -standing scholarship support, all S -STEM projects will continue to conduct research on interventions that affect associate or baccalaureate STEM degree attainment by academically talented U.S. students demonstrating financial need. Because S -STEM projects report much higher retention and graduation rates among their scholarship students than among other STEM majors, this research is important to understand this success so that effective practices can be used at scale. Approximately 90 awards are anticipated in FY 2020, with a continued emphasis on increasing involvement of community colleges, especially Hispanic -serving institutions. S -STEM activities in FY 2020 will leverage efforts in IUSE: EHR, LSAMP, and the IUSE: HSI Program to enhance persistence of students. S -STEM will continue to be a partner in the NSF INCLUDES initiative. S -STEM programming and research also will align with NRT , with the goal of understanding and enhanc ing effective learning environments and pathways for students on the continuum from two -year to four -year to master's and doctoral degrees. Private -Public Partnerships in K -12. The American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 106- 313) amended P.L. 105- 277 and changed the way petitioner fees were to be expended. P.L. 106- 313 directed the remaining 40.5 percent of the total H-1B funding for NSF (15 percent of H -1B receipts) toward K -12 activities involving private -public partnerships in a range of areas such as materials development, student externships, and mathem atics and science teacher professional development. The ITEST program was developed as a partnership activity in K-12 to increase opportunities for students and teachers to learn about, experience, and use information technologies within the context of STE M, including information technology (IT) courses. In FY 2005, P.L. 108-447 reduced the prescribed percentage of H -1B receipts available for private- public partnerships in K-12 to 10 percent (approximately 25 percent of the total H -1B funding for NSF). Private -Public Partnerships in K -12: ITEST. The ITEST program invests in K -12 activities that address the ongoing and growing need for STEM professionals and information technology workers in the U.S. and seeks solutions to help ensure the breadth and dept h of the U.S. STEM workforce. ITEST funds activities for students and teachers that emphasize mathematics, science, and engineering careers, and emphasizes the importance of evaluation and research to understand the impact of such activities. The program s upports the development, implementation, testing, and scale -up of models, STEM robotics projects, and research studies to improve the STEM workforce and build a student's capacity to participate in the STEM workforce. The solicitation places emphasis on capturing and establishing a reliable knowledge base about the dispositions toward and knowledge about STEM workforce skills in U.S. students. Since its inception, the ITEST program has received 3,751 grant proposals and made 488 awards (including co- funded projects) that allow K -12 students and teachers to work closely with scientists, FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress EHR - 17 engineers, and other STEM professionals on extended research projects that promote awareness of STEM careers and interest in pursuing education pathways to those careers. Fund ed projects draw on a wide mix of local resources, including universities, industry, museums, science and technology centers, and school districts to identify the characteristics that attract a wide and diverse range of young people to STEM careers, especi ally those students historically underrepresented in those careers. In FY 2020, ITEST will be a partner in the NSF INCLUDES initiative and will make approximately FY 2018 (Dollars in Millions) 1 P.L. 108-447 directs that 10 percent of the H-1B Petitioner funds go tow ard K-12 activities involving private-public partnerships in a range of areas such as materials development, student externships, math and science teacher professional development, etc. Explanation of Carryover Within the H-1B no-year account, $64.68 million was carried over into FY 2019.

This is being held as part of NSF's enhanced oversight of budget contingency 3Nonew funds were appropriated forNEON inFY2018. TheFY2018 Actual obligations reflect spending ofprior year carryover in FY 2018, and $1.42 million was carried over for future obligation. Modern and effective research infrastructure is critical to maintaining U.S. international leadership in science and engine ering. The future success of entire fields of research depends upon access to new generations of powerful research tools. Increasingly, these tools are large and complex and have a significant information technology or cyber -infrastructure component. To be considered for MREFC funding, NSF requires that a project represent an exceptional opportunity to enable research and education. The project should be transformative in nature, with the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding. The majo r research infrastructure projects included in this budget request meet these criteria based on NSF and National Science Board review and approval. The mid-scale projects funded through this budget line are evaluated separately as described in the section below. In FY 2020, NSF requests $223.23 million for mid-scale research infrastructure and t o continue construction on four ongoing major research infrastructure projects : the Antarctic Infrastructure Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 4 Modernization for Science (AIMS), the High Luminosity- Large Hadron Collider (HL -LHC) , the Large Synoptic Telescope (LSST), and the Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRV). For more information on each major research infrastructure project see the individual narratives later in this chapter. Major Research Infrastructure (Major Facilities) Since FY 2009, major research infrastructure projects funded through the MREFC account have been subject to NSF's \"no cost overrun\" policy. As a result, NSF processes and procedures must assure the developme nt of realistic and well -supported total project cost estimates such that approved budgets are sufficient to accomplish the scientific objectives. The current policy as published in NSF's Large Facilities Manual (to be replaced by the Major Facilities Guid e, or MFG, by the start of FY 2020) requires that: (1) the total project cost estimate when exiting the preliminary design phase includes adequate contingency to cover foreseeable risks; (2) any cost increases not covered by contingency be accommodated fir st by reductions in scope, provided that the actual enacted funding levels have been consistent with the established annual cash flow requirements; and (3) if the project is approved to continue and further scope reductions become too detrimental to scienc e, then the first 10 percent of any cost increase must be covered by the sponsoring directorate through R&RA funding transferred to MREFC, with Congressional approval. . Mid-scale Research Infrastructure As part of the American Innovation and Competitivene ss Act (AICA) of 2017, Congress required the agency to develop a strategy for supporting research infrastructure with a total project cost above the upper limit for the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program , $5.71 million, and below the lower thresh old for the MREFC account , $70 million . NSF has evaluated community demand through the issuance of a Request for Information (NSF 18 -013) that resulted in the submission of approximately $10 billion in ideas for projects in the NSF cos t range of $20 - $100 million. After evaluating that community input, existing mechanisms, and implementation options, NSF is proposing a new dedicated line within the MREFC account for research infrastructure projects in the $20 - $70 million range . Prior to this, such large mid- scale projects could only be minimally supported by the individual directorates due to constraints on R &RA funding. This dedicated funding line implements a high -priority, agency- wide mechanism that includes up - grades to major facilities as well as stand -alone projects, such that all research infrastructure investments above $20 million will be managed as a single portfolio. Individual projects will be selected from submissions to a dedicated program solicitation developed in FY 2019, using NSF's merit review process . Once selected, funding will be allocated from the MREFC account to the responsible d irectora te for award. The lower part of the mid- scale gap, between $6 million and $20 million in Total Project Cost , will be addressed by the individual d irectorates and by a new program drawing its heritage from the NSF -wide MRI program. This graphic shows NSF's central instrumentation and infrastructure programs. Information presented in this chapter focuses on the MREFC account. Information on Mid- scale Research Infrastructure programs, Mid-scale track 1 and track 2 , as part of the Mid -scale Big Idea, can be found in the Mid- scale narrative in FY 2020 OMB Budget Submission MREFC - 5 the NSF -wide priorities chapter. Information on the MRI program can be found in the IA narrative in the R&RA chapter. Dedicated Construction Oversight All projects funded through the MREFC account undergo periodic c ost, schedule, and risk reviews as required by the MFG and the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreements. NSF policies and reporting requirements are designed to ensure routine and reliable tracking of progress (including the use of Earned Value M anagement), project spending, and use of contingency, and that program and recipients each have sufficient oversight and management authority (respectively) to meet project objectives. NSF has greatly strengthened its oversight of major facility projects in recent years, with a number of those enhancements now codified in AICA . One significant enhancement is holding a portion of budget contingency (up to 100 percent) and only allocating contingency funds for obligation to the project based on demonstrated need. This oversight mechanism will generally result in some MREFC carryover each year. However, future obligation of this carryover is anticipated to manage project risks. Enhanced oversight of the construction stage now also includes mandatory incurred cost audits and independent cost estimates, as well as other audits and reviews based on NSF's annual major facility portfolio risk assessment. These efforts are conducted by NSF and are generally not attributable to a specific project at the time of budge t formulation, nor are they part of the total project cost developed and managed by the recipient. To properly support and transparently account for these efforts, actual costs and future estimates for Enhanced Oversight are shown separately from each proj ect in the MREFC account table. In FY 2017 and FY 2018, these activities were supported with funds recovered from projects completed in previous years. In FY 2019 and FY 2020, funding is requested for these ac tivities in the MREFC account.

MREFC - 7 ANTARCTIC INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZATION F OR SCIENCE (AIMS) $97,890,000 The Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science construction project will be initiated in FY 2019 with an investment of $103.70 million. The FY 2020 Budget Request amount is $97.89 million, the second year in a multi- year funding profile . See Baseline History below for a discussion of the Total Project Cost. FY 2019 EstimateFY 2020 $410.40Requested Funding Requirements for the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science Project (Dollars in Millions) In the FY 2019 Request , funding for AIMS was presented in the Office of Polar Programs within the R&RA account. However, in FY 2019 P.L. 116-6 appropriated $103.70 within the MREFC account for AIMS. As such, the FY 2020 B udget Request presents funding for AIMS in the MR EFC account. The AIMS project will replace major facilities at McMurdo Station, Antarctica, one of three permanent stations that comprise the U.S. presence in Antarctica, to meet anticipated science support requirements for the next 35 to 50 years. The project will help ensure enduring U.S. leadership and influence in this strategic region. It will also support critical scientific research and capabilities such as nuclear test detection, earthquake monitoring, and real -time weather data collection for global forecasting. McMurdo Station's main purpose is to support both near - and deep- field science in Antarctica including activities at Amundsen -Scott South Pole Station. AIMS will enable faster, more streamlined logistical and science support b y co-locating or consolidating field science support, warehousing, skilled trades work, and personnel and administrative support into more operational and energy efficient facilities. AIMS will also provide lodging replacement facilities, a vehicle equipment operations center, an emergency operations center, and necessary upgraded utilities to support these facilities. FY 2019 funds were used for initial procurements of material that will be transported to McMurdo Station in early FY 2020, in preparation for the beginning of major AIMS construction. Site preparation work also is beginning in FY 2019. FY 20 20 funds will be used to continue site preparation work for the backbone utilities and the initial buildings, continue to procure the first phases of con struction materials and associated equipment , and begin construction. The AIMS Project is currently anticipated to take up to 10 years to complete. Baseline History In 2011, the Office of Science and Technology Policy and NSF convened a Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) to evaluate the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) logistical enterprise. The BRP was asked to conduct a review of NSF facilities and operations supporting science in Antarctica and to ensure that it can support the scientific opportunities articulated by an earlier 2011 National Research Council report entitled Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean . The BRP report made numerous recommendations regarding maintaining and enhancing the U.S.'s world- class science program in Antarct ica. NSF responded to the BRP report by immediately addressing issues of safety, implementing operational efficiencies which resulted in immediate return on investment, and developing long- term plans for each of the three year -round U.S. stations : Palmer, Amundsen- Scott South Pole , and McMurdo. The AIMS project Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 8 is a pivotal component of the McMurdo Station Master Plan with a specific focus on the primary core functions of this critical logistics hub. The AIMS project seeks to enhance operational su pport for science by improving operations efficiency, containing operating costs, and enhancing safety. The following major scope elements are targeted to achieve these goals: Construction of a Centralized Services Building that replaces and modernizes mul tiple existing facilities on station including centralized warehousing. Construction of an Emergency Operations Facility to replace the existing Fire Station, Medical Facilities, and Fitness and Skills Development Facilities. Construction of a consolidated Field Science Support Facility. Construction of an Industrial Trades Shop to consolidate existing facilities across the station. Construction of a Vehicle Equipment Operations Facility (VEOC) that facilitates maintenance and repair of both heavy and light equipment ranging from traverse tractors, cranes, loaders, and earth moving equipment to trucks, vans, snowmobiles, field generators, etc. Construction of one new lodging facility to ensure adequate bed space to support near term needs, including populati on surges from an influx of construction workers. Importantly, this facility is comprised primarily of single -occupancy rooms needed to promote safety and health. Shared rooms exacerbate sleep disturbance that can arise from widely varying work and travel schedules for the station workforce as well as scientists and promote the spread of contagious conditions such as colds and flu. Upgrade of utilities distribution networks for fire protection water, domestic water, heating, power, communications, and sanit ary sewer. The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) held in December 2016 examined the baseline cost, scope, and schedule utilizing information and conditions available at that time. After an analysis of all information, the result of PDR, and an independent cost assessment, NSF estimated a Total Project Cost (TPC) of $355.0 million for AIMS . The National Science Board authorized NSF to request funds for AIMS, and the estimated TPC of $355.0 million was reflected in the FY 2019 Budget Request. During the two- year interval before the Final Design Review, significant unforeseen cost increases occurred that yielded initial estimates for a TPC as high as $450 million. These potential increases were externally driven and largely due to two causes: (1) significantly increased civil construction costs, related to robust construction opportunities in the continental U.S. that are lower risk compared to AIMS , including responses to several major hurricane and flood events; and (2) substantial global increases in commodity prices. The prime Antarctic Support Contractor was directed by NSF to undertake a reassessment and value engineering process that evaluated several options, including a de -scoped project that would retain the $355.0 million estimate. Holding to the previous cost estimate would severely impact the ability to support science from McMurdo Station, and compromise the health, safety, and efficiency that were integral parts of the AIMS design. However, significant savings were found by re- designing structures and eliminating features that were less critical to overall operational support, while retaining the major scope elements and required capabilities described above. These efforts resulted in a final TPC of $410.40 million . An Independent Cost Estimate was conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with NSF procedur es. The TPC of $410.40 million was authorized by the National Science Board in February 2019.

Management and Oversight AIMS will be accomplished under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) via an existing contract to Leidos Innovations Corporation as the current Antarctic Support Contractor. The Office of Polar Programs will work in collaboration with the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) to use existing contract mechanisms (e.g., monthly program reviews, earned value reporting, award fee evaluation) to ensure rigorous management and oversight of this work. Appropriate NSF major facility oversight requirements will apply, including engagement of the Large Facilities Office (L FO) and use of Independent Cost Estimates , with due consideration of award through a FAR -based contract. Reviews Conceptual Design Review (CDR): CDR was conducted March 31 -April 2, 2015. The NSF program staff concurred with the external panel's conclusion that the project execution plan and technical design Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 10 package met, and in some cases exceeded, the requirements of the Conceptual Design Phase. Preliminary Design Review (PDR): PDR was conducted December 2016. The external panel found that the project execution plan and the technical design package were both well -developed for the PDR phase and recommended that the pr oject was ready to proceed to the Final Design Phase. Following NSF deliberations, the National Science Board passed a resolution (NSB -2017 -20) authorizing NSF to include AIMS in a future budget request. Final Design Review (FDR): FDR was conducted Octobe r 2018. The external panel found that the project execution plan was well-developed for the FDR and recommended that the project proceed to the construction stage . They also recommended that NSF attempt to retain all the major sc ience - suppport capabilities in the original scope , in spite of the cost increase, in order to realize the long -term benefits needed by the USAP. An Independent Cost Estimate also was carried out as part of the FDR process. Project Status Leidos continues to advance the designs of AIMS and is in the process of preparing a final proposal for a contract modification anticipated in March 2019. On February 12, 2019 NSF received authorization from the National Science Board to proceed with construction . Cost and Schedule FY 2020 funds will be used to continue site preparation work for the backbone utilities and the initial buildings, continue to procure the first phases of construction materials, and begin construction. Construction will be phased to allow for minimal impact on scien ce support during construction, as well as ensure continuity of operations in the event that subsequent funding is disrupted. The evolution of the Total Project Cost was discussed above. Although the actual execution of the entire AIMS Project is expected to take 8 -10 years, the proposed appropriation profile is shorter in order to reduce risks (e.g., due to market conditions ) and to facilitate the lengthy supply chain (see Risks section below). Risks The primary risks at this stage of the project (i.e., p rior to contract award) are associated with the uncertainty in market conditions at the time of subsequent contract modifications , affecting labor and materials. During construction, a key risk is the lengthy supply chain required to get the necessary labo r and materials to Antarctica when needed. NSF and Leidos have implemented a rigorous risk management approach which includes the identification of risks and mitigating actions. Future Operations Costs Implementing AIMS will provide a material reduction in the annual cost to maintain and operate McMurdo station including an estimated $ 1.80 million in fuel and $ 4.20 million in labor and other direct costs in comparison with FY 2018 operating costs. By c onsolidat ing the station footprint and using modern energy efficient designs, AIMS will save an estimated 494,000 gallons per year of fuel . Consolidated warehousing and co- located workcenters will permanently reduce the support labor requirement by 80 workers. The new layout will enable improved quality of support and increase the throughput of field science projects. MREFC - 11 DANIEL K. I NOUYE SOLAR TELESCOP E (DKIST) $0 No funding is requested in FY 20 20 for construction of NSF's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. FY 2019 represent ed the final year in an 11 -year funding profile within a n NSB approved not -to-exceed total project cost of $344.13 million. Completion of construction atop Haleakal on Maui, Hawai'i is planned for no later than June 2020. This narrative provides an update o n the project's status. Prior YearsFY 2015 ActualFY Requested MREFC Funds for the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (Dollars in Millions) 1 FY 2019 was the final year for MREFC funding for DKIST construction. The Project is currently on track to complete construction in 2020 within the Total Project Cost cap. When completed, DKIST will be the world's most powerful solar observatory, poised to answer fundamental questions in solar physics by providing transformative improvements over current ground- based facil ities. DKIST will enable the study of magnetic phenomena in the solar photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. Determining the role of magnetic fields in the outer regions of the Sun is crucial to understanding the solar dynamo, solar variability, and solar activity including flares and coronal mass ejections. Solar activity can affect civil life on Earth through phenomena generally described as space weather and may impact the terrestrial climate. The relevance of DKIST's science drivers was reaffirmed by th e National Academ ies of Sciences , Engineering, and Medicine 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics decadal survey: New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics1 as well as the 2012 Solar and Space Physics decadal survey: Solar and Space Phy sics: A Science for a Technological Society .2 DKIST will play an important role in enhancing the \"fundamental understanding of space weather and its drivers,\" an objective called out in the National Space Weather Strategy and associated National Space Weather Action Plan3 both of which were released by the National Science and Technology Council in October 2015. An update to the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan has been developed through the Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation Working Group of the National Science and Technology Council and was informed by community input received through the Federal Register (83 FR 17526). This update, currently undergoing committee review within the Office of Science and Technology Policy, reaffirms a fundamental research objective that includes \"Understanding the underlying physical processes of the Sun that drive space weather events ...\" Baseline History Beginning in 2001, NSF provided funds to the National Solar Observatory (NSO) for an eight -year development and design program for DKIST and its initial complement of instruments through the Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) in MPS and through the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences in GEO. The current design, cost, schedule, and risk were scrutinized in an NSF -conducted Preliminary Design Review in October -November 2006. The original total project cost to NSF, $297.93 million, was set after a Final Design Review (FDR) in May 1 Equipme nt and Facilities Construction MREFC - 12 2009, which determined that the project was fully prepared to begin construction. NSB approved an award for this amount at the NSF Director's discretion, contingent upon completion of compliance with relevant environmental and cultural/historic statutes. In FY 2009, $153.0 million was appropriated to initiate construction. Funding was provided through a combination of the MREFC account ($7.0 million) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) account ($146.0 million). Given the timing of the receipt of budget authority and the complexity of project contr acting, the entire $153.0 million was carried over from FY 2009 and obligated in FY 2010. The environmental compliance requirements were completed on November 20, 2009, and the NSF Director signed the Record of Decision authorizing construction in December 2009. The Hawai'i Board on Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) approved the project's appli cation for a Conservation District Use Permit (CDUP) in December 2010. A contested case challenge to the 2010 CDUP issuance delayed site construction until the BLNR ruled in favor of the DKIST project and issued a new CDUP November 2012. Full access to the site atop Haleakal followed shortly thereafter. Site preparation and excavation began in November 2012. The unexpected length of the delay associated with the environmental compliance process led to a reassessment of the project schedule and total proj ect cost in 2012. An external panel of experts reviewed the revised baseline and recommended increasing the total project cost by approximately $46.20 million.

The DKIST telescope enclosure and Support and Operations building at the site on Haleakal , Maui, to Congress MREFC - 13 The DKIST project is a collaboration of scientists and engineers at more than 20 U.S. and international organizations. Other partners include the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and international groups in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Some partnership activities include: The U.S. Air Force (USAF) replaced the aluminizing chamber at their Advanced Electro -Optical System telescope on Maui and sized it to accommodate the DKIST primary mirror. An Interagency Agreement for use of the Mirror Coating Facility (MCF) was signed by NSF and the U.S. Air Force in FY 2017. This eliminates the need to build a -band instrument named the Visible Tunable Filter (VTF) as an in -kind contribution. Queens University Belfast (Northern Ireland) is leading a consortium of institutions from the United Kingdom that will suppl y high -speed visible cameras to feed the DKIST instruments. Discussions of other possible contributions for second- generation instruments, algorithm development, coordinated observations, and student exchange are ongoing. Management and Oversight NSF St ructure: NSF oversight is handled by a program officer in AST working cooperatively with staff from MPS, the Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management (BFA), the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) , and the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs. W ithin BFA , the Large Facilities Office (LFO) provides advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. Representatives from the above NSF offices comprise the DKIST Integrated Project Team, which meets on a quarterly basis to discus s outstanding project issues. External Structure: NSO conducts the construction project. NSF funds NSO operations and maintenance (O&M) and DKIST design and construction via separate c ooperative support agreements (CSAs) beneath an overarching c ooperative agreement (CA) with the managing organization, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA). The DKIST CSA for construction expires June 30, 2020. In 2015, the NSO CA and O&M CSA were renewed through the end of FY 2024. This peri od covers the DKIST construction phase and the achievement of sustainable operations of the completed facility.

Several councils and working groups give input from the solar and spac e physics communities. Reviews Management, Cost, and Schedule reviews: DKIST scope, schedule, budget estimate, and risk -adjusted total project cost were scrutinized and validated at the Preliminary D esign and Final Design Reviews. Independent Risk Assessm ent (IRA): LFO engaged a contractor to perform an independent assessment of the project's remaining risks as DKIST enter ed the critical integration, testing and commissioning (IT&C) stage of construction. The IRA consisted of a document desk review followed by an in- person meeting i n September 2017. The final report was received by NSF i n December 2017. The final report transmittal memo from the contractor states: \"We are pleased to report that the DKIST project has a mature risk management program that is well -positioned entering the Integration, Testing, and Commissioning (IT&C) phase. We found no critical areas that require corrective action.\" Government Accountability Office (G AO) Study : Based on congressional interest (Senate Report 114- 289), t he GAO assessed \"NSF Major Projects\", which included the DKIST construction project. The GAO final report was issued in June 2018. T he GAO characterized the DKIST Project as one of two NSF projects that have experienced both cost and schedule increases. As descri bed above, the cost and schedule increases were due to 30 months of unavoidable permitting delays , which resulted in the 2013 re-baseline of the project . Programmatic Review: A comprehensive external programmatic review of the DKIST MREFC construction proj ect is scheduled for April 2019 in Boulder, CO. In addition to an assessment of the project's status against the Project Execution Plan, the review will focus on project close- out and criteria for acceptance. Earned Value Management (EVM) System Surveillance: In conjunction with the programmatic review described above, a one -day surveillance of the project's EVM system will be conducted in April 2019. This surveillance will provide an updated assessment of the project's previously validated EVM system. Project Status The DKIST project continues to make progress on construction at the summit of Haleakal on Maui, HI, while remaining in compliance with all local, state, and federal environmental and cultural requirements. The project continues to consult w ith various stakeholders on a regular basis including the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources, the Hawai'i Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Park Service, and Native Hawai'ian cultural practitioners. Construction highlights : A Level 1 milestone was achieved in FY 2018 with the completion of the Telescope Mount Assembly (TMA). In FY 2018 the primary ( M1) mirror and the M1 Cell Assembly were successfully transported to Maui. The M1 commissioning blank and the M1 were both successfully coated at the USAF MCF . The M1 Cell Assembly successfully underwent site acceptance testing. The M1 commissioning blank was installed in the TMA to test the full range of motion under the mirror load. The M1 was installed in the Cell Assembly and the entire package installed on the TMA for initial alignment. In early FY 2019, DKIST achieved its first images of star light and completed its first pointing model using a temporary Nig httime Acquisition Telescope mounted at the telescope prime focus. In FY 2019, the project will continue to implement the critical IT&C phase of construction. Fabrication of the first of the DKIST instruments , the visible broadband imager (VBI), will be completed and the VBI delivered in FY 201 9. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 15 In FY 2019 the project is expected to achieve another Level 1 milestone, i.e., first -light on the sun with the VBI instrument. In FY 2020 the project will continue to work through the final stages of IT&C and the integrati on of all first -light instruments . By Q 4 of FY 2020, it is exp ected that DKIST will have achieved its final Level 1 milestone \u2014Start of Operations. Cost and Schedule The original baseline not -to-exceed, risk -adjusted cost was established following FDR. As noted above, a revised project baseline review was held in Oct ober 2012; NSB approved the new baseline in August 2013. Total project cost of $344.13 million is derived from ARRA ($146.0 million) and annual appropriations in the MREFC account ($198.13 million). A Monte Carlo analysis of the risk -adjusted project end date at the time of the project re - baseline indicated June 2020 at an 80 percent confidence l evel for successful completion. The project is currently on track for a FY 2020 end date . 4 Risks Project management control, interface control, and change controls are in place. The project also maintains a risk register that is reviewed and updated monthly . Technical : Most of the remaining technical risk s are relatively low because of the long development and design phase . The CSA between NSF and AURA identifies four facility- class instruments to be delivered by the DKIST project at the end of the MREFC construction phase. The P roject is on track to deliver those four instruments. The VTF is a fifth instrument and is an in- kind contribution from the German KIS being designed and developed through a Memorandum of Understanding between AURA and KIS; therefore, the risks for this instrument remain with the German institute. KIS is currently on track to deliver the VTF instrument to DKIST prior to the start of operations . Environmental and Cultural Compliance : AST, NSF's OGC , and the DKIST project have carefully worked through the applicable statutes, and a cultural monitor has been retain ed during construction. All required permits are in place and semi -annual consultations with a Native Hawai `ian working group continue. Following the November 2012 issuance of the CDUP as mentioned in the Baseline History section above, several challenges to both the CDUP and the University of Hawai`i's Haleakal Observatory (HO) management plan made their way through the State court system. In October 2016, the Hawai `i Supreme Court ruled against the appellant in both cases, upholding both the project's CD UP and the H O management plan. Remaining environmental and cultural compliance risks are low since the p roject continues to be in compliance with all requirements as defined i n the Biological Opinion (BO) ,5 the Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) ,6 and the Programmatic Agreement. 4 At the time of writing in February 2019, commercial power to Haleakala has been off -line for several weeks, possibly to extend up to two months, due to severe storm damage in Maui, H awai'i. This could cause a minor delay in project completion. 5 At the time of this writing, February 2019, complia nce obligations contained within the U .S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS') BO have been met and closed out via a letter to NSF from the USFWS. 6 At the time of this writing, February 2019, NSF is scheduled to appear before the Endangered Species Reco very Committee in March 2019 seeking a recommendation to close out comp liance obligations as listed in the State of Hawai' i Division of Forestry and Wildlife HCP .

Major Research Equipme nt and Facilities Construction MREFC - 16 Environmental Health and Safety : NSO has a well -developed safety program engendered in the DKIST project. The DKIST project has developed a site safety plan and conducts annual external safety reviews. In addition, safety update s are provided to NSF by the project on an monthly basis and DKIST project safety is one of the topics covered in the annual external program reviews. Operations Costs DKIST operations are funded through R&RA. In FY 2020, the projected budget of $19.01 million includes $17.01 million for DKIST operations and $2.0 million for cultural mitigation activities as agreed to during the compliance process. This will be the final year of the 10 -year award for cultural mitigation activities. MREFC - 17 HIGH LUMINOSITY -LARGE $33.0 million in FY 2020 to begin upgrading components of the A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS ) and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS ) detectors to the High Luminosity -Large Hadron Collider (HL -LHC). This is the first year of support for a five- year construction project with a preliminary total project cost of $150.0 million Prior Luminosity-Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) Upgrade (Dollars in Millions) The Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and highes t energy particle accelerator. Located near Geneva, Switzerland , and operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the LHC can accelerate and collide counter -propagating bunches of protons at a total energy of 14 tera-electron volts (TeV). Physicists study the debris from these collisions to learn about the elementary particles and fundamental forces that shape the universe. ATLAS and CMS are two general purpose detectors used by researchers to observe these collisions and analyze their characteristics. Baseline History Since 2011, U .S. funding for ATLAS and CMS operations and maintenance ( O&M ) funding has included investments in advanced research and development ( R&D ) for investigations into detector modifications that will enable them to function at much higher collision rates following an upgrade to the LHC to increase its luminosity . Each detector group, comprised of researchers from a ll participating countries, developed a scoping document1 that described its scientific goals and the technical path forward for operation in the challenging HL -LHC environment. In 2014, the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) , a subcommit tee of the High Energy Physcis Advisory Panel that advises NSF and the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ), recommended U .S. participation in the detector upgrades . In fall 2014, MPS charged a subcommittee of the MPS Advisory Committee (MPS AC) to advise on an appropriate response. The subcommittee, with MPS AC endorsement, recommended NSF provide construction funding at the MREFC level to enable meaningful participation by NSF -supported scientists in the HL -LHC research program. In November 2015, the NSF Dir ector approved entry of the HL -LHC upgrade to the ATLAS and CMS detectors into the Conceptual Design phase. The principal objectives of this activity were to define a quantitative statement of science requirements, develop a flow -down of the science requir ements to a set of technical requirements, define the major technical components, and provide NSF with a top- down estimate of the associated cost, schedule, and risk. Conceptual Design Reviews (CDR) in March -April 2016 established the major functional elem ents of each detector designated for NSF support and determined that these elements would enable the principal science objectives within the $150.0 million funding envelope defined by NSF in consultation with the MPS A C. In August 2016, the NSF Director approved entry into the Preliminary Design phase. The principal goals of this phase were to develop a detailed technical description of the scope to be fabricated, the risk -adjusted total project cost for each detector based on bottom -up cost estimates, the corresponding resource- loaded 1 Atlas: https://cds.cern.ch/record/1502664?ln=en ; CMS: http://cds.cern.ch/record/2020886 Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 18 schedules, year -by-year budget profiles for construction, and plans for managing risk. NSF directed that the total project cost should not exceed $150.0 million, or $75.0 million for each detector. NSF conducted Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR) of CMS and ATLAS, in December 2017 and January 2018 respectively, which established that ATLAS and CMS met the PDR requirements. The review panels expressed confidence that the MREFC scope for each detector upgrade could be accomplished within its individual preliminary $75.0 million MREFC budget cap. NSF subsequently carried out a comprehensive cost analysis that substantiated the basis of estimate for the requested construction budgets. In July 2018, the NSB authorized the NSF Director to include construction of the High Luminosity upgrades to the ATLAS and CMS detectors in a future B udget R equest . Science Plan Initial operation of the LHC , and the ATLAS and CMS detectors, enabled the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, leading to the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics . The Higgs mechanism explains how fundamental particles acquire mass. This represents the last major piece in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, which describes all fundamental particles and their interactions. Despite this historic accomplishment, the ATLAS and CMS experiments have only scratched the surface of the ultimate physics potential of the LHC. There are many open fundamental questions in particle physics. Three key science questions that the HL- LHC program will address are: What are the properties of the Higgs boson? Are there new particles and interactions beyond those predicted by the Standard Model? What is the nature of Dark Matter? To answer these questions, researchers must compare theoretical predictions with observations of various rare processes, such as those involving the Higgs boson, that could be sensitive indicators of new physical phenomena. Discovering meaningful departures from theoretical predicti ons will require high precision measurements and the collection of a data sample more than two orders of magnitude larger than the one used for the Higgs discovery in 2012. To accomplish this, CERN plans to upgrade the accelerator , which will be renamed th e High Luminosity -LHC , to deliver the high in tensity proton beams required. In parallel, NSF proposes to fund the development of critical components of the ATLAS and CMS detectors that will allow them to record and analyze the torrent of data to be produc ed. The accelerator enhancements and the detector upgrades will be installed and commissioned during 2024- 2026. More than 50 funding agencies worldwide will contribute various components of the upgraded detectors , including significant contributions by D OE. NSF is working closely with DOE to coordinate development and de sign activities, as well as operational aspects of their mutual involvement in the operation of the ATLAS and CMS detectors. The HL -LHC will commence 10- years of operation in mid- 2026 to produce more than 10- times the data collected by LHC operation through 2024. FY 2020 NSF Budget $16.60 - - - - - - - reflects $7.50 million of forward funding for FY 2019 and FY 2020 HL-LHC development and design. No additional funds are expected in these years. 2 O&M funding represents operations support for the current LHC facility and is forecast to remain constant during the HL-LHC upgrade. Installation, integration, and system testing of the upgraded detectors will be coordinated by CERN during 2024-2026. NSF's share of installation and commissioning costs is estimated at $5.0 million per detector, which will be funded from the FY 2024-2026 O&M budgets.Total Funding Requirements for HL-LHC Upgrades (Dollars Prior YearsFY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES $0$5$10$15$20$25$30$35 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025HL-LHC Upgrades Funding, by Stage (Dollars in Millions) Development & Design (R&RA) Implementation (MREFC) Operations & Maintenance (R&RA) Management and Oversight NSF Structure : NSF oversight is handled by a program officer in the MPS Division of Physics (PHY). Cross -foundation coordination is provided by an integrated project team (IPT) that includes staff from the Office of the Director, Office of the General Counsel, Office o f Legislative and Public Affairs, Office of the Assistant Director for MPS, OIS E, EHR , and BFA . Within BFA, the Large Facilities Office and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support provide advice to program staff and assists with agency oversigh t and assurance. The NSF program officer works closely with PHY Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 20 colleagues overseeing the Experimental Particle Physics research program at NSF, and with counterparts in the DOE Office of High Energy Physics. Interagency coordination is accomplished throug h a Joint Oversight Group (JOG), which meets semi -annually. The framework for joint DOE/NSF oversight of the U .S.-led portion of the international ATLAS and CMS collaborations has a successful history spanning nearly two decades. It is based on an initial interagency memorandum of understanding implemented in December 1999 and superseded in March 2018 to encompass HL -LHC activities. External Structure : Columbia University (ATLAS) and Cornell University (CMS) will be the primary MREFC awardee institutions. N SF-funded principal investigators at Columbia and Cornell will be responsible for accomplishing the NSF -designated scope . NSF and DOE funded activities, which together form the U.S. collaboration for ATLAS and CMS, will be coordinate d through the JOG as described above . The U .S. collaboration will coordinate with the international ATLAS and CMS project leadership to accomplish the entire upgrade program. The NSF construction scope for ATLAS and CMS was selected, at the outset of Conceptual Design, to be min imally coupled to other construction activit ies of DOE or international partners so that NSF's construction can be executed as two relatively independent projects within the overall scope of upgrade activities. NSF currently receives monthly technical status reports and quarterly financial reports of de velopment and de sign activity and will receive monthly financial and technical status reports throughout construction. Revisions to the scope, budget, and schedule baselines will be reported to NSF, and r evisions exceeding thresholds to be defined in the cooperative a greements for construction will require prior NSF approval. Interaction with CERN : In May 2015, DOE, NSF, and CERN executed a Cooperation Agreement concerning scientific and technical cooperat ion in nuclear and particle physics. The Cooperation Agreement establishes the framework under which DOE , NSF, and their awardees, as well as DOE national laboratories , will participate in the particle physics programs in the international ATLAS and CMS de tector collaborations (under the auspices of CERN ) in the era of the HL -LHC. Subject to availability of appropriated funds, NSF's total contributions to the HL -LHC upgrade program will be specified and incorporated under separate implementing arrangements in the form of a ddenda to the 2015 Cooperation Agreement . The CERN LHC Resources Review Boards (separate boards for ATLAS and CMS) are composed of representatives from each participating funding agency. The Boards monitor and oversee resource -related matte rs as defined by the framework for participation in each experiment. NSF is a full member of these LHC Resources Review Boards. The Boards meet semi - annually to approve all LHC upgrade planning at the international level. Reviews Conceptual Design Reviews: March 2016 (ATLAS); March and April 2016 (CMS). Preliminary Design Reviews: January 2018 (ATLAS); December 2017 (CMS).

Department of Energy (DOE) Critical Decision 1 (CD -1) reviews: June 2018 (CMS); July 2018 (ATLAS). CD -1 approval marks the completion of the project definition phase and the conceptual design. Major subsystems of the combined international effort were scientifically and technically reviewed by the CERN LHC Committee (LHCC) , an international committee of technical experts, followed by a cost and schedule review by the CERN Upgrade Cost Group , an international committee of technical and financial experts, which reported to the LHCC (July 2017- April 2018). Project Status PDR verified that all aspects of the technical scope are well defined. The flow -down from science to engineering requirement s is sound and the lowest level requirements appear to be complete. Designs are FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 21 capable of meeting performance requirements and are sufficiently mature that their risk -adjusted budgets may be confidently estimated. The Project Execution Plan (PEP) for each detector upgrade defines the construction responsibilities of the individual PIs and the awardee and subawardee university research groups . Each PEP documents the schedule and labor needed to accomplish these tasks. Each project has developed a credible r esource- loaded schedule, defining the integration of these tasks and the logical sequence of work to be done. During the Final Design phase, ATLAS and CMS will complete prototyping and preproduction testing of detector elements and electronic components. The PDR determined that the remaining engineering challenges are clearly defined and that the ATLAS and CMS development teams can meet them. ATLAS and CMS will complete preparatory planning and enabling R&D with the goal of commencing construction in Apr il 2020. NSF plans to hold Final Design Reviews of ATLAS and CMS around September 2019. In parallel, NSF will carry out a Cost Analysis informed by an Independent Cost Estimate review of the upgrades to confirm the validity of the construction- ready cost e stimate for each detector. Cost and Schedule Funding for development and design was accomplished by redirecting $2.0 million per year from the LHC O&M budget in FY 2017- 2019 and augmenting this amount with funding from the Division of Physics , including $7.50 million of forward funding from FY 2018 funds for FY 2019 and FY2020. The planned April 2020 construction start date is dictated by the need to complete fabrication and delivery to CERN to meet the international integration schedule for 2024- 2026. A significant delay could result in the transfer of critical NSF -funded scope to other international partners for accomplishment, resulting in lost leadership opportunities for U .S. scientists. NSF's contributions to the ATLAS and CMS upgrades represent ab out six percent of the international detector upgrade program. The MREFC project will be completed when the NSF -funded apparatus is delivered and passes component performance testing at CERN. Installation, integration, and system testing will be coordina ted by CERN during 2024- 2026. NSF's share of installation and commissioning costs is estimated at $5.0 million per detector, which will be funded from the FY 2024- 2026 O&M budgets. The annual O&M cost is forecast to remain constant during and following the HL-LHC upgrade installation. Risks Technical Risk : Technical designs are sufficiently mature to credibly support estimates of the costs to complete development and industrialization, and of construction. Remaining technical decisions during the Final Design stage have credibly bounded cost and schedule i mpacts. There are multiple alternatives for dealing with the remaining design uncertainties. Deployment Risk : The MREFC project concludes with delivery and verification of subcomponent operability at CERN. CERN has overall responsibility for assembly, integration, and commissioning of the upgraded detectors, integrating the contributions from more than 40 different countries. While a slip in the CERN schedule will delay scientific research, it will not increase the cost of the NSF -funded construction. A significant delay may place schedule demands on NSF's O&M beyond 2026. Management Risk : The PDRs established that the ATLAS and CMS management teams are well -qualified. Their organizational structures and delegations of responsibility are appropriate for p lanning and construction. After reviewing evidence of high -quality cost estimating processes (as defined in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide2), the PDR review panel reports expressed confidence that each 2 www.gao.gov/new.items/d093sp.pdf Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 22 upgrade can be accomplished within its estimated TPC of $75.0 million . The construction schedules for each upgrade have realistic durations and are based on sound assumptions and methods. Conservative estimates of the time needed to accomplish critical tasks significantly mitigate the risk of in curri ng overall delay in completing construction, although there are opportunities for continued optimization of schedule risk that will be pursued during Final Design. Partnership Risk : This activity supported through DOE and NSF research grants to univ ersities, which creates a partnership risk where a potential shortfall in available research funding to one agency could impair the construction plans of the other. NSF and DOE plan to work closely in the lead- up to construction to regularly monitor and co ordinate risk planning. Disposal Costs : CERN's policy is to dispose of all irradiated detector components when they are no longer used in the detectors. Consequently, there are no anticipated costs to NSF at the end of operation. Future Operations Costs An additional agreement between NSF, DOE, and CERN (\"Experiments Protocol II \"), signed in December 2015, documents the responsibilities of U .S. participants to provide normal maintenance and operation of detector subsystems and components provided by NSF and DOE. Future MOUs with CERN will describe the distribution of tasks and other responsibilities for all participating institutions, including those supported by NSF, a s well as the organizational, managerial, and financial guidelines to be followed by each detector collaboration. NSF anticipates providing approximately three percent of the total operation cost of the ATLAS and CMS detectors during HL -LHC operation (as i t does today). This proportion is based on the number of NSF -supported sci entists in each collaboration. Data handling and computing costs are not yet established. A 10-fold increase in data rates would have dramatic consequences if dealt with using curr ently available technology. A well -orchestrated global effort is underway, progressing in parallel with the HL -LHC detector upgrades, to meet these needs. ATLAS and CMS are coordinating their efforts within this framework to seek common solutions. This improved coordination extends to the U .S. funding agencies, other funding agencies, and CERN. These efforts will coalesce into a planned 2020 HL -LHC Computing Technical Design Report, which will lay the foundation for a computing and data management system that will meet the requirements of the HL -LHC in 2026. NSF's support for the new system will come from within the approximately $10.0 million per year operational support it plans to provide each detector for O&M . In addition, NSF recently made a five- year, $25.0 million award to a consortium of 17 universities led by Princeton University to establish a software institute as a first step toward addressing the Big Data and c omput ing challenges imposed by the data demands of the upgraded detectors . MREFC - 23 LARGE SYNOPTIC SURVE Y TELESCOPE (LSST) $46,340,000 The FY 2020 Request for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is $46.34 million. This is the seventh year of support for a nine -year construction project that began in August 2014. The NSB -approved not-to-exceed total project cost is $473.0 million for NSF's contribution to the project' s the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (Dollars in Millions) LSST is located in Chile and, when completed, will be an 8.4 -meter wide- field optical telescope designed to carry out surveys of nearly half the sky. The initial 10- year survey has a cadence enabling repeat observation of each survey field approximately twice weekly. The requirements for LSST were set by considering four key science areas: the physics of dark energy and dark matter a census of small bodies in the Solar System, including potentially hazardous Near -Earth Objects the structure and contents of the Milky Way galaxy the nature of transient astronomical objects on time scales ranging from seconds to years. By satisfying th e requirements defined by these key investigations, the LSST survey will result in a comprehensive data set that will enable hundreds of fundamental astrophysical studies by the entire research community on these and other topics. Thus, LSST has the potent ial to advance every field of astronomical study, from the inner Solar System to the large -scale structure of the Universe. Baseline History LSST is a joint NSF and Department of Energy (DOE) project to build an instrument that was ranked the top large gr ound- based astronomy project by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics decadal survey : New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics . 1 Prior to NSF's construction award, NSF, DOE, and privat e (non- federal) partners invested over $130.0 million in LSST -related work. About 70 percent supported design and development , and about 30 percent, from the non- federal funding, supported casting and polishing of the innovative combined primary- tertiary mirror (M1M3), initial site preparation, and prototype detector creation and evaluation, all of which significantly reduced construction risk. NSF and DOE conducted a series of reviews in 2011 and 2012 to determine the project baseline, including the NSF Preliminary Design Review and a subsequent cost estimation review. Plans were kept up -to-date to synchronize the DOE and NSF funding profiles as reviews continued, leading to NSF's Final Design Review (FDR) in December 2013. NSF then carried out a detailed cost analysis prior to following through on its approval process and making an award in the last quarter of FY 2014. 1 www.nap.edu/catalog/12951/new -worlds -new -horizons -in-astronomy -and-astrophysics Design $57.13 - - - - - - - - Operations & Maintenance311.10 - (Dollars in Millions) 1 FY 2018 obligations for Operations & Maintenance are intended to cover pre-operations costs for the first three years of the pre-operations ramp up, FY 2019-FY 2021. 3 Operations & Maintenance funding represents NSF support only and amounts to about 49 percent of the operations cost. Other support from DOE and non-federal contributors provides the balance. 4 Includes $4.74 million carried forward into FY 2019.2 Outyear funding estimates are for planning EstimatePrior YearsFY 2018 Actual1FY 2020 Cerro Pach \u00f3n, Chile , was selected for LSST because of the excellent sky transparency and image quality, dark skies, small fraction of cloudy nights, and the geological characteristics that enable the rapid telescope motions required to carry out the LSST survey. LSST will col lect nearly 40 terabytes of multi- color imaging data every night for 10 years, producing a long -lived data set of unprecedented utility. It will produce the deepest, widest -field sky image ever and issue alerts for changing and transient objects within 60 seconds of their discovery. Repeated deep imaging of every part of the accessible sky will turn up explosive events such as cataclysmic variable stars, supernovae, and the optical counterparts of X -ray flashes, as well as finding moving objects and better characterizing those already known.

Assuming other existing NEO efforts continue, at the end of LSST's 10- year prime mission, the catalog ue for objects larger than about 140 meters across should be about 75 perce nt complete for NEOs (about 80 percent for PHAs). Without LSST the completeness would be about 60 percent for NEOs ( about 65 percent for PHAs). LSST data will be widely accessible, and discovery opportunities will be available to K -12 students as easily as to professional astronomers. An innovative citizen science program will involve people of all ages in LSST discoveries. More than half of the cost during operations is for data management, including user - friendly interfaces tailored for the different an ticipated communities. The survey strategy makes the same data set usable for almost all of the astronomy community as well as for educators and the general public. The primary data archive is planned to be located at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Illinois. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is handled by a program officer in the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) working cooperatively with NSF staff through the Integrated Project Team with members from MPS, BFA, the Office of General Counsel , the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs, OISE, and the Office of the Director. Within BFA, the Large Facilities Office provides advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. The NSF p rogram officer works closely with counterparts in the DOE Office of High Energy Physics, who have oversight responsibility for the LSST camera sub -project. Interagency coordination is accomplished through weekly meetings of a Joint Oversight Group and was formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding signed in July 2012. External Structure: The responsible awardee for LSST construction is the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), a non- profit science management corporation consisting of 46 U.S. member institutions and 4 international affiliates as of February 28. AURA works closely with the LSST Corporation (LSSTC), which initiated LSST development and remains responsible for privately raised funding. AURA and LSSTC establish ed the LSST Project Office as an AURA - managed center for construction; this office is overseen by the AURA Management Council for LSST. The LSST p roject director and the LSST project manager are experienced in large facility construction and operation and are appointed by AURA, with the approval of NSF and DOE. AURA is also the responsible awardee for LSST pre- operations ramp -up activity that began in October 2018. AURA is responsible for coordinating construction activities and pre -operations activities that execute side- by- side. Reviews Technical Reviews : Reviews were conducted throughout the development and design phase, culminating in NSF's FDR in December 2013, with DOE involvement. All major sub- systems undergo regular system - level design reviews or ganized by the LSST Project Office with external participants. Management, Cost, and Schedule Reviews : Cost, schedule, and risk are also scrutinized by the technical reviews. During construction, NSF and DOE hold regular joint progress reviews. The m ost recent reviews are summarized below: A successful data management -focused review took place in July 2017, providing support for significant use of cost contingency. The third joint agency progress review occurred in Sept ember 2017 and was successful. The la test joint agency progress review occurred in July/August 2018 and was also 2 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.11.033 3 https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06209 Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 26 successful. Follow -up Earned Value Management surveillance reviews coincided with the 2017 and 2018 annual progress reviews. In January 2017, DOE and NSF held a joint external agency review of the project's plans for commissioning and t ransition to early operations. NSF and DOE followed up this review in August 2018 with another in- depth review of the project's advanced plans for commissioning as a significant extension of the annua l progress review. The review panel praised the state of LSST commissioning plans. In December 2017, NSF and DOE held a joint review of the project's proposal for operations of the full ten -year survey, plus an additional four years of pre -operations ramp up and two yea rs of post - survey activity. The review was successful, and NSF and DOE began initial funding of early pre - operations activity in FY 2019 (with NSF forward -funding from FY 2021) . Project Status NSF's construction award was issued in August 2014. As of January 2019, the project's MREFC scope is 66 percent complete. The primary telescope building has been completed, and dome installation and mirror cell lift construction are underway in earnest. About $100 million worth of components were successfully shipped or prepar ing for shipment to the site in 2018. The Auxiliary Telescope, used for calibration purposes, is being installed and commissioned. Progress on the LSST base facility located in La Serena, Chile, is progressing with no new risks that cannot be mitigated through the allocation of additional available contingency and is set to be completed in early to mid- year 2019. NSF - and DOE -supported activities remain tightly coordinated, both at the project level and between agency program officers. Cost and Schedule The FDR panel found the NSF Total Project Cost (TPC) of $473.0 million to be reasonable and justifiable, and they also recommended that the project introduce possible additional descoping options. NSF carried out further cost review prior to making the award. The LSST Project established a joint cost and schedule Monte Carlo (MC) method through their Project Management Control System and showed that the computed TPC corresponds to a bette r than 90 percent chance that the final cost of the current construction scope will fall within the NSB -approved funding cap and by the planned survey start date. This result was finalized in April 2015 and incorporated into the associated c ooperative support agreement. In addition to NSF' s contribution, DOE 's baseline for the camer a was fixed at $168.0 million. Construction also includes approximately $39 million from non- federal sources, all of which has been expended. As of September 2018, the project h ad allocated 5 3 percent of the total contingency to the baseline, and $38.40 million of contingency remains. One recent change was for a 2.5 -month schedule shift of the project finish date. The early finish is now in January 2022, reducing schedule conting ency to 8.5 months, down from the starting contingency of 13 months. The 2018 annual integrated MC analysis was completed and indicates an 88 percent confidence that the project will be completed within the TPC of $473.0 million and a 90 percent confidence that the project will be completed by August 2022, one month ahead of the defined period of performance for construction. At the same time NSF and DOE work closely with the project to monitor and consider remaining descoping and deferral options. Risks Technical : Much of the technical risk was retired during development and design. Since full construction began, no new major risks have appeared, and small, realized risks have been mitigated by use of cost and schedule contingency, including float internal to sub -projects. The Data Management (DM) construction effort has been identified as a risk and re- planning has been completed. Implementation of the recommendations of the July 2017 DM review, including the release of cost and schedule contingency, has been completed. Careful planning to stage DM deliverables in coordination with commissioning sequencing FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 27 will mitigate those risks associated with DM. Commissioning plans overall have pathfinders to mitigate technical risks as the entire system is assembled and integrated over the next two years. Environmental and Cultural Compliance : Environmental and cultural impact mitigation continues as planned with no unforeseen issues. Site: The possible site risk due to local geological anomalies, noted in previous requests, was realized during excavation. Since this risk was localized and anticipated, it was successfully handled. Site disruptions from geological events and extreme weather remain as possible risks with appropriate mitigation plans. Environmental Hea lth and Safety : The LSST project has a full -time head of safety with experience in AURA operations, which has a long history of an excellent safety record in Chile. Both the summit and base sites have on -site safety supervisors employed by LSST to monitor contractor and project activities. All safety plans are fully compliant with applicable standards from U.S., Chilean, and participating institutions, and are updated regularly. External reviews have given the project high marks for its safety culture. Partnership Risk : Significant attention has been paid to partnership risk, and that risk has been mitigated by careful coordination and unified project structures. The LSST project director oversees the entire project. A single project manager, agreed to by b oth NSF and DOE, manages the complete work breakdown structure elements. Budgetary management details are clearly set out between the project director, the project manager, the project's Change Control Board, the AURA Management Council for LSST, and the agenc ies' program officers, grants officers, and financial managers. Operations Costs Operation costs are funded within R&RA . NSF is planning to support approximately half of operations funding with the balance coming from the DOE and non- federal, primarily international contributors. Operations costs are planning estimates based on the most recently available data. The overall 10- year operations cost estimate to NSF remains unchanged at $310.0 million (then- year U.S. dollars). The final full operations costs and the amount required from non- federal contributors will be determined through a review, approval, and award process that began with the project's submission of a formal proposal for the full LSST survey operations, including pre- and post -survey activities, in August 2017 and initial external panel review in December 2017. An additional proposal for the first three years of pre -operations ramp -up was received in May 2018 and cover ed costs through FY 2021. This proposal was re viewed and awarded in FY 2018 using FY 2018 R&RA funds to cover the entire proposed period. Additional O&M funds are not anticipated to be required in FY 2019 - 2021. The N SB is expected to review a request to authorize an operations award in FY 2020 or FY 2021, which will fund operations beginning in FY 2022. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 28 In their joint memorandum of understanding, NSF and DOE agreed to fund operations, increasing agency support and revising the operations plans, as appropriate. AST is planning to provide approximately half of the original estimated steady -state amount, as well as operations ramp -up support, with the DOE Office of High Energy Physics providing one quarter, plus installation and commissioning support additional to the project construction cost. The project team has already established firm agreements to fund about half of the remaining one quarter with contributions from non- federal entities. Negotiations continue with potential partners to fund the remaining balance. LSST from Gemini South at Sunset, August 2018.

FY 2017 ActualFY $127.09 $353.97Appropriated and Requested MREFC Funds for the Regional Clas s Res earch Ves s el Project (Dollars in Millions) In justification of their recommendation to NSF for the construction of RCRV, the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) report, Sea Change: 2015 - 2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences ,1 described eight high- priority science questions that will be supported by RCRV in U.S. coastal waters: 1. What are the rates, mechanisms, impacts, and geographic variability of sea level change? 2. How are the coastal and estuarine ocean and their ecosystems influenced by the global hydrologic cycle, land use, and upwelling from the deep ocean? 3. How have ocean biogeochemical and physical processes contributed to today's climate and its variability, and how will this system change over the next century? 4. What is the role of biodiversity in the resilience of marine ecosystems and how will it be affected by natural and anthropogenic changes? 5. How different will marine food webs be at mid- century? In the next 100 years? 6. What are the processes that control the formation and evolution of ocean basins? 7. How can risk be better characterized and the ability to forecast geohazards like mega -earthquakes, tsunamis, undersea landslides, and volcanic eruptions be improved? 8. What is the geophysical, chemical, and biological character of the subseafloor en vironment and how does it affect global elemental cycles and understanding of the origin and evolution of life? Baseline History The RCRV project is a major component in the plan for modernizing the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF).2 In 2001, a report f rom the Federal Oceanographic Facilities Committee documented the need for Regional Class vessels. In 2004, NSF and the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) entered into an interagency agreement that resulted in two candidate designs for Regional Class ships. In 2007, the Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report identified the need for NSF -built Regional Class vessels to meet future science demand. In 2009, another National Academies report, Science at Sea, described the desirable characteristics of a modern Regional Class vessel. These characteristics and other science community factors were considered by the review panel when the preferred NAVSEA design was later down- selected. In 2012, NSF issued a solicitation for the refreshed design and potential constr uction of RCRV. Oregon State University (OSU) was selected and received the award in 2013.

In 2015, the National Science Board authorized inclusion of funds to initiate construction for the RCRV project in future budget requests at the NSF Director's discretion. The Final Design Review was conducted in December 2016 and the panel recommended to NSF that the project was ready to advance to the construction stage. OSU awarded a contract for construction to Gulf Island Shipyards, Houma, LA. NSF plans to fund the operati ons of the RCRVs without increasing overall fleet costs, which is a result of fleet right- sizing and modernization.

Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The RCRV project is overseen by the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) as part of the Ship Acquisition and Upgrade Program. OCE provides overall interdisciplinary science community guidance and oversight, while the administrative location of the RCRV project in the Integrative Programs Section promotes science facilities sup port expertise and coordination. Within NSF, RCRV project oversight is managed by a dedicated program officer with support from a secondary program officer who has experience with other OCE facilities. Cross- Foundation coordination is provided by an Integr ated Project Team (IPT). The IPT includes staff from the BFA Large Facilities Office, BFA Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, BFA Division of Institution and Award Support, $0$20$40$60$80$100$120$140 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025RCRV Funding, by Stage (Dollars in Millions) Development & Design (R&RA) Implementation (MREFC) Operations &Maintenance (R&RA)FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 31 Office of the Director, Office of the General Counsel, Office of the A ssistant Director for Geosciences, and Office of Legislative and Public Affairs. External Structure: The RCRV project is funded through a series of cooperative agreements with OSU to manage the design refresh ( conceptual, preliminary, and f inal designs), c onstruction, testing and trials, and eventual operation of the first RCRV for the scientific community. The principal investigator for the award is the project manager (PM), who reports directly to the OSU Dean of the College of Earth, Ocean , and Atmospher ic Sciences. The PM interacts directly with NSF and manages the RCRV administrative staff. The project scientist is a co -principal investigator on the award. The PM manages the core RCRV team including the risk manager, earned value management and schedule specialist s, contracting officer, and OSU shipyard representative (SR). The SR in turn manages the naval architect and engineering contract and oversees the OSU shipyard staff and marine science technical advisors. The RCRV Science Oversight Committee wit h regional representation, multidisciplinary expertise, and independent science representatives conducting research in mission areas supported by stakeholder federal agencies (e.g., NSF, Office of Naval Research, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) will be active through all project phases. The SOC provides guidance to the OSU RCRV project team through the PM and/or the NSF program officer. Reviews Proposal Review: In 2012, NSF issued Solicitation 12- 558, Construction of Regional Class Research Vessels, which resulted in the selection of OSU as the lead institution for construction and ship operations. RCRV proceeded through the standard NSF processes that included a Conceptual Design Review (December 2013), Preliminary Design Review (A ugust 2014) and Final Design Review (December 2016). The Final Design Review (FDR) ensured that anticipated project costs remained realistic and that no unforeseen events had arisen prior to the start of construction during FY 2017. The FDR Panel recommen ded that the project advance to the Construction Stage. Annual Progress Review: The first construction stage review was conducted in August 2018. Progress towards Design Verification and Transfer and OSU's management of the shipyard contract was evaluated. The panel expressed confidence that the OSU Team is well qualified, has extensive relevant experience in ship acquisition, has established a positive, professional working relationship with Gulf Island Shipyards , and is entirely capable of delivering up to three RCRV s, within budget and on schedule, that will meet mission requirements. Project Status As stated above, NSF selected OSU as the lead institution. A cooperative agreement was awarded to encompass the entire project, including tests and trials. T he project is divided into four distinct phases, each to be funded through separate cooperative support agreements, with award of each phase contingent upon successful completion of the prior phase. These phases are: Phase I: Project Refresh (Years one to three) Phase II: Shipyard Selection (Year four) Phase III: Construction (Years five through eight) Phase IV: Transition to Operations (Years eight and nine) The project completed Phase II in CY 2017, during which bids for construction of RCRV were solici ted and evaluated from U.S. shipyards. The Phase III construction award with OSU has been made. Total estimated funding to OSU for RCRV through FY 2019 is $ 11.39 million in R&RA funds for development and desi gn and $ 318.0 million in MREFC uction . An additional $540,000 in R&A funding was obligated for other design costs. The remaining unobligated funding for the construction of three ships is $35.97 million , which is contingency held at NSF, for a total of $ 353.97 million in MREFC funding. Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC - 32 Cost and Schedule The length of the project is projected to be nine fiscal years, including nine months of schedule contingency. Funding for the construction of RCRV from FY 2017 through FY 2020 supports the shipyard contract structure. One significant enhancement to NSF oversight is holding a portion of budget contingency (up to 100 percent) and only allocating to the program, for obligation to the project, based on demonstrated need. This oversight mechanism will generally result in some MREFC carry o ver each year ; however, future obligation is anticipated to manage project risks. Risks Technical : The following technical risks are among the principal risks identified on OSU's project risk register. Planned mitigation strategies are included here with each identified risk. (1) Various situations may occur that could delay or add cost to OSU's management portion of the project. These include delayed appointments of key personnel, contracting issues, lack of management capacity due to optimistic planning, or misunderstanding of requirements. Contingency funds are included to increase OSU management capacity if needed. Approximately $2.80 million in contingency ha s been allocated to -date as a result of realizing this Project Management Capacity risk . (2) So nar sensors, science load handling systems, and other vessel sub -systems may also not perform as required. Contingency funds are included to ensure performance capabilities are met, given that many warranties are not likely to be performance- based or be otherwise limited contractually with the shipyard. (3) Growth in weight and vertical center of gravity has require d design changes , namely lengthening by six feet, to ensure vessel seaworthiness. This is a typical risk for ship construction (and research ves sels in particular) that require s active management by OSU and the shipyard, as well as oversight by NSF, such that the ship can operate safely and effectively. Approximately $5.10 million has been allocated to- date as a result of realizing this Weight and Stability risk. This risk is reduced by the re -design, but will not be entirely eliminated until the as -built ship is evaluated. A science prioritized, time -phased de -scoping plan is in place (per NSF Large Facilities Manual, NSF17 - 066) to minimize impacts to science capabilities in case contingency funds are insufficient to cover realized risks. Future Operations Costs Annual ship operations costs are well understood after several decades of experience with vessels of all types in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. OSU included an estimate for the first year of operations beginning in 2022 using reasonable assumptions for escalations through 2021. They also assumed a robust but reasonable operating schedule of 200 days per year. OSU estimates each RCRV will cost $ 7.0 million to operate in its first full year, resulting in a rate of $3 5,000 per day, including technician support. This is comparable to the operation of current similar vessels after applying the appropriate cost escalation factors for size and complexity. NSF supports approximately 70 percent of the use of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet, which suggests RCRV is likely to cost NSF approximately $ 5.20 million in FY 2022, which is the first year the first two RCRVs transition into operatio ns in the ARF. The ultimate annual cost of approximately $14.70 million for operating three RCRVs will be balanced by cost savings from reducing scope elsewhere in the Academic Research Fleet. A solicitation for operations of additional vessels beyond the first RCRV (R/V Taani ) operated by OSU was released in January 2018. The The East Coast Oceanographic Consortium, whose members include URI, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the University of New Hampshire School of Marine Science and Ocean Eng ineering \u2014along with 13 associate members, was selected to operate the second RCRV (R/V Resolution) . Operator selection for the third RCRV will be made after the construction contract option is exercised. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress MREFC - 33 Artist's rendition of the RCRV.

The latest edition of Indicators , which was released in January 2018, include d a state data tool that allows for more frequent and timely updates and state one -pagers that highlight select data by state. At the recent request of Congress , the Board produced report s on operations and maintenance costs for NSF facilities and funding for mid -scale research infrastructure. Other items in the Advisory and Assistance Services line support multi media strateg ies, such as data-driven dynamic graphics, film, and video, to increase awareness and use of the Board's products by stakeholders. This budget line also supports maintenance of an electronic official records management system, which enables compliance with federal records requirements; th e webcasting and archiving of all open Board meetings; transcription services necessary for compliance with the Government in the Sunshine Act ; and board book management software which facilitates effective and efficient NSB meeting s. The NSB's Travel and Transportation of Persons budget line primarily covers costs related to Board member travel to NSF headquarters for the Board's four annual meetings and a member -only retreat, for oversight of NSF's large programs and facilities, and for engaging stakeholder s. In conjunction with the release of Indicators 2018, for example, the Administration, Congress, and scientific societies requested a greater number of briefings by Board members than in previous years. Recently , the Board org anized listening sessions in Washington DC, Virginia , and South Carolina to explore the challenges and opportunities facing the skilled t echnical w orkforce. Also supported in this budget line is travel for invited speakers and participants in the NSB 's activities , such as a panel on the future of fundamental S&E research that the Board organized at its February 2019 meeting . The Communications, Supplies, and Equipment budget line funds communications services and information technology . The FY 2020 Budget Request will support the Board's efforts to strengthen the U.S. S&E enterprise through its policy and information -related activities. Specifically, the Request will support the NSB's continued engagement with stakeholders \u2014including Congress, the Adm inistration, academia, the business community, and the general public \u2014to better understand their diverse needs. In turn, this will help the NSB (and NCSES) improve the usefulness of the resources it produces, ensuring that these stakeholders continue to ha ve access to timely, comprehensible, and objective S&E data and policy guidance. OIG - 1 OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL (OIG) $15,350,000 +$263,000 / 1.7% The Appropriations Act that funds the National Science Foundation contains a separate appropriation for NSF's Office of Inspector General. Accordingly, this FY 2020 OMB Budget Request identifies the resources needed to support OIG, including amounts for pe rsonnel compensation and benefits (PC&B), contract services, training, travel, supplies, materials, and equipment.

Office of the Inspector General Amount: $400,000 Reason: Funds are expected to be used to procure financial and forensic audit services. The selection of awards and institutions to be audited will require careful preparation and is subject to changing circumstances and new information that may require additional time to process. Obligation: Anticipated FY 2019 Quarter 4 Office of Inspector General OIG - 2 OIG Responsibilities and Structure OIG provides independent oversight of NSF's programs and operations. The office promotes effectiveness, efficiency, and economy in administ ering the Foundation's programs and prevents and detects fraud, waste, and abuse wi thin NSF or by individuals who receive NSF funding . By statute, NSF OIG is organizationally independent from the agency, with the Inspector General (IG) reporting directly to the National Science Board and Congress. Given the geographic breadth of the proj ects NSF funds, OIG conducts audits and investigations across the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Antarctica. To fulfill its important mission, OIG employs a diverse staff of scientists, attorneys, certified public accountants, criminal investigators, management analysts, data analysts, and information technology specialists. OIG's FY 2018 appropriation was just 0.2 percent of NSF's appropriation and 0.05 percent of NSF's $29.8 billion portfolio of active awards, yet its r eturn on investm ent is many times that amount. OIG serves as an invaluable safeguard against fraud, waste, abuse, and whistleblower reprisal. OIG's work is divided into two functional areas: the Office of A udits and the Office of I nvestigations, which are supported by t he Office of Management, Office of Counsel, and Immediate Office of the Inspector General. Highlights of the office's operational impact and strategic focus by functional area follow: Audit Impact and Strategic Focus OIG's Office of Audits (OA) conducts audits of NSF's contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants to universities and other research institutions, as well as internal audits of NSF's programs. These audits help ensure that financial, administrative, and programmatic activities are conducted economically, effectively, and in compliance with applicable regulations. In FYs 2017-2018, OIG audited $4.2 billion in NSF funding in 15 states and Washington, D.C. \u2014 resulting in 34 audit and other engagement reports containing a total of $5.1 million in questioned costs and 232 recommendations to improve NSF operations. The map below shows the value of the awards audited in each state. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress OIG - 3 In FY 2018, OA identified more than $1.32 million in questioned costs and made 101 recommendations to NSF and it s awardees to strengthen program and grant operations. NSF has already taken, or committed to take, corrective actions for 40 of the 101 recommendations . In addition to recouping questioned costs, implemented recommendations from recent OIG audits have hel ped strengthen NSF's records management, oversight of conference spending, and controls over its large- scale, multi -user research facilities (major facilities). Much of OA's work is focused on recipients of NSF's oversight of major facilities, which are s tate-of-the art infrastructure including telescopes, ships, and observatories. As of November 2018, NSF supported 25 major facilities, each of which cost between $70 million and $800 million to construct. NSF also spends approximately $1 billion a year on major facility operations. Since 2010, OIG has issued 61 reports containing 151 recommendations to improve NSF's management of major facility construction and operations. To date, NSF has addressed 145 of these recommendations. Additionally, Congress relie d on these audit reports and recommendations to codify several major facility -focused requirements in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 (AICA). OA is currently conducting an audit to determine whether NSF, as part of its oversight of the construction and operations of major facility projects, has internal controls that ensure awardees allocate their construction and operation expenses to the correct award. Ensuring that strong controls exist over the use Office of Inspector General OIG - 4 of such funds is vital, as the use of operations funds for construction work can hide cost overruns and deplete funding needed for the operations phase. OA's plans for continuing oversight of major facilities inclu de: Assess ing how NSF identifies, plans for, and manages essential divestment opportunities for major facilities. The AICA requires NSF to plan for the full lifecycle of a major facility, including costs associated with divestment of a facility at the end of a lifecycle. OA also plans to monitor NSF's actions in response to the AICA. Auditing NSF's oversight of awardee reporting of program income and its use of contractors to assess the impacts of its scientific investments. Monitor ing the design, construct ion, and ongoing capital investment and support of the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS ), one of NSF's most challenging major facility initiatives. According to NSF, the AIMS project will ensure that McMurdo Station remains a viable platform for supporting Antarctic science for the next 35 to 50 years. In addition to discretionary audits, OIG oversees the audit of NSF's annual financial statements, annual audits mandated by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA), biennial audits mandated by the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act), and triennial audits mandated by the Government in the Sunshine Act of 1976. Additionally, in FY 2 019, OIG is required to review NSF's fleet utilization, and may begin work to comply with the Grants Oversight and New Efficiency (GONE) Act. OA continuously reviews its audit approaches and techniques to identify opportunities for improvement. In FY 2018, OA reengineered its approach to internal audits by conducting audit work at awardee institutions to test the effectiveness of NSF controls. This new process will strengthen audit findings and help NSF improve its controls . OA also improved its proces s of contracting for grant and contract audits to ensure it has the flexibility to address the highest risk areas. In the past, contractors only conducted incurred cost audits. The new model includes an audit survey that evaluates the awardee's risks on si te and recommends the optimal type of audit to address those risks. This new approach will help ensure OA can address systemic issues relating to proper management of Federal funds, recapture misused funds, and ensure proper stewardship of Federal funds go ing forward. To increase efficiency and effectiveness, OA has also begun developing additional data mining tools for use in performing both internal and external audits. These new text -mining capabilities will allow the office to quickly analyze hundreds of documents, which would otherwise need to be reviewed one at a time, and combine predictive analytic capabilities to identify high -risk transactions, misuse of funds, or potentially fraudulent activity. Investigative Impact and Strategic Focus OIG's Office of Investigations (OI) conduct s investigations of criminal , civil, and administrative wrongdoing related to NSF programs and operations, including all entities and individuals that receive NSF funds . OIG also e valuate s allegations of research misco nduct such as data fabrication, data falsification, and plagiarism related to NSF -funded research. As the map below illustrates, OI's investigative oversight of the NSF award portfolio is expansive. I n FYs 2017 -2018 OI conducted 382 investigations spanning 46 states, as well as Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and Antarctica . FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress OIG - 5 When appropriate, OI refers the results of their investigations to the Department of Justice or other authorities for criminal prosecution, civil litigation, resolution via settlement agreements and institutional compliance plans, and other administrative actions to protect federal funds. OI's investigations resulted in numerous and significant criminal convictions, civil settlements, investigative recoveries, award suspensions and ter minations, and government -wide suspensions and debarments of individuals and entities. Office of Inspector General OIG - 6 OI investigations yield substantive results for NSF and the Federal government. S ince FY 2009, OI investigations have resulted in numerous convictions and financial r ecoveries to the Federal government of over $65.0 million, including nearly $51.0 million of NSF funds. In FYs 2015 -2018, OIG's investigations resulted in nearly $29.0 million in recoveries, or approximately $362 ,500 per OI line investigator , as well as 122 suspensions, debarments, or other actions taken to protect federal funds from unscrupulous individuals and entities. In FY 2019 to date, OI investigations have resulted in over $3.0 million in recoveries. OI's vigilance ensures that those who receive NSF funds to conduct research are held accountable and serves as an important deterrent to grant fraud and research misconduct. Continuing and emerging threats to the integrity of funded research challenge OI's ability to oversee NSF's award portfolio. Foreign threats to American research and development, as well as growth in Small Business Innovation Research a nd Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR /STTR) cases , continue to increase t he size and complexity of OI's workload. Beginning in FY 2018 and continuing into FY 2019, OI initiated its first criminal investigations focused on potential misuse of NSF funding by members of foreign \"talent plans\". Recent Congressional hearings have also focused on the theft of U.S. federally -funded research and development by foreign states who use talent plans to exploit the openness of American universities and research enterprises. OI has confronted this national security threat through close collaboration with the FBI and other investigative partners and is engaged in many efforts to assess whether actions by participants in such plans violated Federal laws, rules, or regulations . There are c osts associated with these investigations that do not apply to other civil or criminal investigations because document ary evidence along with interviews conducted in a foreign language may require transcription or the services of a certified translator. OI is also working to address fraud in the SBIR/STTR programs. Through its leadership of an OIG community working group focused on fraud in these programs, OI has generated more than 19 5 SBIR/STTR cases since 2010. With NSF's total annual SBIR/STTR award expenditures now approaching $200.0 million, protecting SBIR/STTR funds from fraud and abuse has become even more import ant. OI has successfully partnered with NSF program managers to improve SBIR/STTR processes and procedures to reduce the opportunity for fraud to occur . OI also conducts SBIR/STTR -related outreach at semiannual NSF awardee workshops, providing guidance to the small business community on how to properly handle Federal funds and the consequences of not following the rules. OI oversight also contributes to the integrity of funded research and to the identification of unscrupulous individuals who violate the basic precepts of responsible conduct of research through commission of data fabrication, data falsification, and plagiarism. OI's investigative scientists are respected worldwide for their expertise in dealing with research integrity violations and are of ten asked by international and national academic/research organizations to share their expertise regarding trends in research misconduct , particularly data falsification. They provided significant input and support for the National Academy of Science's (NAS) 2017 report on Fostering Integrity in Research, which addresse d rising trends in research misconduct and other violations of research norms. OIG also conducted a review of Responsible Conduct of Research programs at awardee institutions in response to a directive in the America COMPETES Act of 2007. In FY 2018, OI's investigative scientists began an assessment of 10 years' worth of plagiarism cases to identify trends and other information NSF and universities can use to help address the prevalence of plagiarism in the research enterprise. Support Offices' Actions and Impacts Office of Management. This centralized office is responsible for strategic planning/budgeting, procurement, human resources, IT services and administrative support for the entire office. Specific functional areas in Office of Management (OM) include: FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress OIG - 7 Budget and administration \u2014responsible for all budgetary, financial and most administrative business conducted by the office, as well as coordination with NSF to provide human resources and procurement support. Intake operation\u2014 all complaints regarding fraud, waste, and abuse are handled by an intake coordinator, who processes over 250 allegations annually. The external OIG Hotline website has been revamped to quickly identify substanti ve allegations which are then reviewed by management for consideration. Forensic accounting and data analytics \u2014several years ago , we added a forensic accountant skilled in data analytics to help investigators manage the large amounts of information they received through subpoenas and other means. The forensic accountant reduced the need for contract services by over 50 percent, saving $100,000 per year. Additionally, the application of data analytics to vital functions such as contractor oversight yields further management efficiencies and cost savings. IT services\u2014IT support including website maintenance and posting of reports, digital forensics, and data security. The digital forensics activity has become much more critical in investigations, as most of the evidence being captured is electronic. Office of Counsel. The Office of Counsel (OC) consists of the Counsel to the IG and two assistant counsels, one of which is part -time. It provides comprehensive legal advice and critical analysis to the IG and al l OIG divisions, including legal review of externally -issued OIG work product s and certain correspondence . OC handles myriad subject areas, including audit -related support , ethics, appropriations law, acquisitions, information disclosure, privacy, personnel, and IG Act authorities. OC also supports the larger IG community through active participation in CIGIE projects and committees. On average, OC handles more than 150 act ions per year, which include routine reviews, Freedom of Information requests, and legal opinions on various matters. Immediate Office. The Inspector General's immediate office includes the Chief of Staff and Executive Assistant. The Chief of Staff handles all matters relating to external affairs, primarily congressional relations, and public/media contacts. Government -wide Impact Though small relative to many other OIGs, NSF OIG continues to make significant contributions to the Inspector General commu nity and the government at large. For example: NSF's Inspector General has served as the vice chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency ( CIGIE) since 2014, which includes: 1. chairing CIGIE's IG Candidate Panel to help the White House identify strong candidates for vacant Presidentially -Appointed Senate -confirmed IG positions; 2. representing the IG community in a Five -Eyes effort focused on counter -fraud begun by the British government; and 3. leading CIGIE's Grant Reform Working Group, which provides valuable feedback and insights to OMB staff as they consider grant -related changes. NSF OIG has conducted outreach to the Federal IG community, provided training to other investigative agencies, and taken the lead to establish and run four IG community working groups to: 1. prevent fraud within the SBIR/STTR programs; 2. increase the use of government -wide suspension and debarment as tools to deter and reduce instances of fraud, waste and abuse; 3. foster the next generation of senior investig ative leaders within the IG community; and 4. address emerging threats to U.S. national security through efforts by foreign governments to steal intellectual property and other research. In FY 2017, OI hosted its fifth government -wide Suspension and Debarment Workshop. These free Office of Inspector General OIG - 8 events (which are now co- sponsored by the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Council) have trained hundreds of individuals from OIGs, Suspension and Debarment Offices, Offices of General Counsel, and United States Attorneys' Offices . Because of these workshops, several agencies that were not previously using suspensions or debarments to protect federal funds have begun to do so, while other agencies already using them are employing them more effectively. OIG staff are working with the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Council to plan the sixth suspension and debarment workshop in FY 2019.

During the past five years, the average cost per FTE increased by approximately 25 percent due to a rise in benefit expense, as well as the mission essential replacement of lower wage administrative staff with auditors and investigators. Travel costs for both audits and investigations are expected to increase by about 20 percent over current levels by FY 2020 due to several factors, including travel to the Antarctic for ove rsight work associated with the McMurdo modernization, as well as the expanding landscape of OIG investigations, as previously described. For these reasons, the Budget requests an increase of $263,000 in FY 2020. In addition, to help absorb anticipated cost increases due to travel and other cost increases, OIG will reduce the number of staff as well as spending in other areas, including contracts, IT resources, and training.

These can include instrumentation networks, observatories, accelerators, telescopes, research vessels, aircraft, and simulators. In addition, scientific utilization of cyber -enabled and geographically -distributed facilities continues to increase as a result of rapid advances in computer, information, and communication technologies. NSF's investments are coordinated with those of other organizations, federal agencies, and international partners to ensure they are complementary and well - integrated. Planning, operations , and maintenance of major facilities are funded through the R&RA account. Most construction is funded through the MREFC account. In FY 2018, NSF created the new position of Chief Officer for Research Facilities in the Office of the Director, to enhance oversight of major facilities throughout their complete lifecycle. The individual in that position serves as the senior agency official whose responsibility is oversight of the development, construction, and operations of major facilities across the Founda tion, as required by Section 110 of the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P.L. 114- 329). The Facility Operation Transition activity proposed in the Integrative Activities (IA) section is a pilot program that reflects NSF's strategic commitment to successful operations and maintenance (O&M) of new major facilities as well as balancing portfolio funding between facilities and investigator research, both of which were emphasized in the NSB's Congressionally requested 2018 report entitled \"Study of Operations and Maintenance Costs for NSF Facilities\" (NSB -2018- 17). 1 NSB envisioned a more flexible MREFC account as one way to achieve these goals; owing to the challenges that would be introduced by maintaining separate construction and operations fundi ng in the MREFC line, the recommended strategic funding is requested in the R&RA account instead. The funds in this activity will be used to (1) partially support initial O&M of new facilities so that the full O&M costs can be gradually absorbed into the m anaging division or directorate, and (2) partially support divestment of lower -priority facilities, the full cost of which may significantly impact individual divison or directorate funding. A total of $10 million is requested for the Facility Operation T ransition activity. Of this amount, $8 million will support O&M for NSF facilities that are within the first five years of their operational life \u2014the Ocean 1 National Science Board, Study of Operations and Maintenance Costs for NSF Facilities (NSB -2018- 17), May 2018, www. nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsb201817/nsb201817.pdf . Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 4 Observatories Initiative (OOI) , the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) , and the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). This funding will be divided among the three facilities in proportion to their total O&M requirements. This amount is less than 10 percent of the O&M costs of these three facilities, so that the majority of the funding remains the responsibility of the managing directorate. The Facility Operation Transition funds will assist the research directorates in sustaining the core research needed to take advantage of the new facility capabilities. The remaining $2 million for this activity will support an analysis of NSF's facilities portfolio in order to determine science priorities and divestment opportunities, as well as investments in actual divestment activities. The distribution of IA support between facilitie s O&M and divestment will be re- evaluated annually as new facilities come online and lower -priority facilities are removed from NSF 's portfolio. This program as a whole will be reevaluated after three years to determine whether it should be modified, conti nued, or ended. This chapter provides descriptions of each major facility supported through the R&RA account and provides funding information by lifecycle phase for each facility. The information presented for each facility follows the overall framework established by NSF for major facility projects. Information on projects under construction and funded through NSF's MREFC account is provided in the MREFC chapter. The following pages contain information on NSF's major facilities in FY 20 20.

The vessels in the ARF range in size, endurance, and capabilities, enabling NSF and other federally - and state -funded scientists to conduct ocean science and technology research with a diverse fleet capable of operating in coastal and open ocean waters. Funding for the ARF includes investments in ship operations; shipboard scientific support equipment; o ceanographic instrumentation and technical services; and submersible support. Funding levels reported here reflect investments by the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) within GEO . In addition to operations, OCE has undertaken selected construction projects based on inter-agency planning and coordination as discussed in the Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report1 published in May 2013. Details on these construction activities are contained in the Fleet Modernization section. $74.10 $74.10 Facility Upgrade Alvin upgrade 6.00 - - - - - - - Total $86.03 - $74.10 $74.10 $74.10 $74.10 $74.10 $74.10 2 Outyear estimates are for planning purposes only.

Facility Upgrade: In FY 2018, NSF awarded $6.0 million provided above the Requested level for upgrades to Deep Submergence Vehicle (DSV) Alvin. For more information on the upgrade please see Fleet Modernization section below. The ARF serves as the main plat form for the collection of data and testing of hypotheses about the structure and dynamics of the ocean, as well as the development and testing of novel technological instrumentation. Scientists contribute to advances in many areas including climate variab ility, marine ecosystems, fisheries, and ocean- related natural hazards, such as tsunamis, through use of these facilities. Participating graduate and undergraduate students interact with scientists and marine technicians, enabling them to gain first -hand exposure to ocean science field research. Increasingly, technological innovations allow research conducted at sea to be transmitted via satellite back to the classroom, broadening the educational impact of the vessels. The ARF is financially supported through an interagency partnership, principally with the Office of Naval 1 www.nopp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/federal_oceanographic_fleet_status_report.pdf FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 7 Research (ONR) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The operating costs for the fleet are divided proportionally among the vessel users based on usage over the past several years, including the Ocean Observatories Initiative's use of the fleet. NSF coordinates with ship -operating and ship- user academic institutions both directly and through the University -National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) organizational structure. Funding for scientists using the fleet is provided by NSF and other federal and state agencies. Within NSF, science is funded through competitive peer -reviewed proposals, most typically funded within OCE and through selected programs in the Division of Earth Sciences, Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, OPP, and BIO. Approximately 25 percent of OCE proposals request ship time. Not reflected in this number is the science that utilizes samples or data collected on prior cruises, scientists piggy -backing on scheduled cruises to accomplish additional science, international scientists sailing with the ARF , and science funded by other agencies. The FY 2020 funding level of $74.10 million will support approximately 1,625 ship operating days , and includes the entry into the fleet of the R/V Rachel Carson (owned by the University of Washington) replacing the retired NSF -owned R/V Clifford A. Barnes . During FY 2020 the ONR -owned Global Class R/V Revelle will re -enter the fleet af ter a one -year mid-life refit and the ONR -owned Global Class R/V Atlantis will enter her mid -life refit period which will have a one -year duration. In addition to being a general purpose research vessel, R/V Atlantis also serves as the support ship for the Deep Submergence Vehicle (DSV) Alvin. Alvin is scheduled to undergo a major refit during the same period R/V At lantis will be out of service. Addi tional details are included in the Fleet Moder nization section below. Fleet Operations/Management and Oversight Oversight: NSF provides oversight to the ARF through cooperative agreements with each ship- operating institution and through a separate cooperative agreement with the UNOLS Office. NSF is the cognizant agency for ship day- rate negotiations for the ARF, regardless of owner. In addition, NSF oversees the fleet through Business Systems Reviews, site visits, ship inspections, participation at the UNOLS Council , and various committee meetings by NSF P rogram Directors. Several P rogram Directors w ithin OCE at NSF, at NOAA, and at ONR are involved in the activities and oversight of the ARF. For purposes of performing proper oversight under AICA , seven individual vessels out of the eighteen in the ARF have been designated as major facilities. Additio nally, o nce they reach the operations stage, the three RCRVs will be included in this group as well. After an in -depth review of the application of rate structures on ARF ship- related activities, NSF and ONR have transitioned the accounting of Fleet activities into a Specialized Service Facility in accordance with OMB's Uniform Guidance for Federal Awards 2 CFR 200.468. Management: Management of an institution's ship -operating facilities varies with the scale of the operation, but the core responsibility typically resides with the d irector of the institution, the Marine Superintendent (for all aspects of the facility), and the ship's Captain (for at -sea operations). For larger multi- ship- operating institutions, a Chief of Marin e Technicians, schedulers, and finance administrators may also be involved in facility management. Reviews: Based on projected science requirements identified in recent reports and workshops, a fleet of vessels supporting ocean science and technological re search will be needed far into the future. Documents supporting this need include the Final Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force 2 of July 19, 2010. Two applicable reports by the National Research Council (NRC) include Science at Sea: Meeting Future Oceanographic Goals with a Robust Academic Research Fleet3 2 Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 8 published in 2009, and Critical Infrastructure for Ocean Research and Societal Needs in 20304 published in 2011. In coordination with UNOLS and the other federal agencies that invest in ocean research, the Interagency Working Group on Facilities and Infrastructure (IWG -FI) published a Federal Oceanographic Fleet Status Report5 in May 2013, reviewing the status and describing plans for modernizing the Federal Oceanographic Fleet, which includes both the Academic Research Fleet and the survey ships. This repor t was updated in March 2016.6 In January 2015, the National Academy of Sciences Report Sea Ch ange 2015- 2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences7 identified the U.S. Academic Research Fleet as having \"the strongest match between current infrastructure and the decadal science priorities\" and emphasized the overall importance of ships in all of the NAS -identified ocean science and technology priorities. Ship operations and technical services proposals undergo external review by peers every five years. Detailed annual reports describing activities accomplished are provided by the operating institutions and budgets are negotiated yearly since they are dependent on the number of days the ships will be at sea in support of NSF -funded research programs. Fleet Modernization Oversight: The NSF coordinator for fleet modernization activities is the Program Direct or for Ship and Submersible Support, within the Integrative Programs Section (IPS) in OCE, with additional IPS staff providing project management assistance as required. Ocean Class Research Vessels: ONR funded the design and construction of two new Ocean Class Research Vessels which have now been fully integrated into the ARF operating schedule. R/V Neil Armstrong operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution replaced the Global Class R/V Knorr and R/V Sally Ride operated by Scripps Institution of O ceanography replaced Global Class R/V Melville. Regional Class Research Vessel s (RCRV): In March 2012, NSF leadership approved the request to advance the RCRV to the Conceptual Design Review (CDR) phase as a candidate MREFC project. Funds to initiate cons truction were requested and appropriated in FY 2017 . Keel -laying for the first RCRV named R/V Taani was completed in November 2018. The RCRV w ill address requirements across government agencies for research vessels in support of ocean science research as d iscussed in the Fleet Status Report Update of 2016. Keel laying for the second RCRV named R/V Resolution will be in May 2019. For additional information on RCRV please refer to the MREFC chapter. R/V Sikuliaq , formerly the Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV): The R/V Sikuliaq represents NSF's first major contribution to fleet renewal in over twenty years. Delivery of R/V Sikuliaq took place in June 2014. This was followed by a period of final outfitting, scie nce trials, and transit to the first science operational area. Initial science operations began in late 2014. R/V Sikuliaq successfully completed ice trials in the Bering Sea and three science cruises in the Arctic Ocean during 2015. All final MREFC projec t activities were closed out under budget by March 2016. R/V Sikuliaq provides a sophisticated and significantly larger platform for scientists, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, to participate in complex multidisciplinary research activities and enables the training of the next generation of scientists with the latest equipment and technology . R/V Sikuliaq greatly expands research and technology capabilities in the Arctic, providing up to 250- 300 science days at sea annually. DSV Alvin: The A lvin upgrade project consists of two phases: Phase One, completed in 2014, consisted of a major overhaul of all vehicle systems and incorporation of a new titanium personnel sphere, which resulted in continued operation of the submersible at its historic d epth rating of 4500 meters. Phase Two, funded in 2018 , with $6.0 million, will enable operations to 6500 meters water depth and thus expand the accessible area of operations for Alvin from approximately 60 percent of the 4 www.nap.edu/catalog/13081/critical to Congress Facilities - 9 seafloor to more than 95 percent . It will also enable relatively shallow, mid -water work in places where the water depth currently prohibits operations. The Alvin Upgrade Project Team at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is working with the Naval Sea Systems Command to design, fabricate, test, and certify all components necessary to complete the upgrade. The primary long- lead item remaining in the schedule is the variable ballast system, which will require design, fabrication, testing and certification of new pressure spheres. This system , as well as new foam floatation and other improvements, will be ready for incorporation into Alvin during the overhaul in 2020, concurrent with the mid -life refit of the support ship R/V Atlantis . Renewal/Recompetition/Termination Ships supported by NSF are operated by academic institutions, each having a cooperative agreement with NSF. Renewal of all ship cooperative agreements, with the exception of one vessel , were renewed in FY 2018 using a process including external panel review . All future cooperati ve agreements for ship operator awards for NSF -owned ships will undergo an open competition every ten years. Awardees are subject to additional oversight measures, including quarterly safety and financial reporting, the use of NSF Business System Reviews, and site visit inspections. In 2018, NSF retired R/V Clifford A. Barnes, operated by the University of Washington, which was replaced by the R/V Rachel Carson purchased by the University of Washington.

Antarctic Facilities OPP provides the infrastructure needed to support U.S. research conducted in Antarctica, including research funded by NSF and by U.S. mission agencies, for year -round work at three U.S. stations, on two research ships, and at a variety of remote field camps. Support to other agencies includes mission- essential satellite communications support at McMurdo Station for the Joint Polar Satel lite System (JPSS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ground Networks for the relay of data. Through a partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NASA, and the European Organization for the Exp loitation of Meteorological Satellites, OPP supports the relay of real -time satellite - based weather information that informs global forecasting. In addition, OPP enables important climate monitoring activities for NOAA at the Clean Air Facility at South Po le Station . OPP also provides support for NASA's Long Duration Balloon program that enables research in fields ranging from astrophysics to cosmic radiation to solar astronomy; the South Pole Remote Earth Science and Seismological Observatory, the most sei smically -quiet station on earth and a key site contributing to U.S. activities associated with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to U.S. Geological Survey and NSF efforts for global seismic monitoring; and access to sites that are key to precise orbit determinations for optimizing use of the Global Navigation Satellite $192.14 $192.14 AIMS Development and Design 16.14 - - - - - - - Palmer Pier Upgrade 28.58 - - - - - - - Total $192.14 $192.14 $192.14 $192.14 $192.14 $192.14 are planning purposes only. 1 FY 2018 Actual includes $42.58 million in additional FY 2018 one-time funding above the requested amount; $14.0 million for AIMS Development and Design and $28.58 million for Palmer Pier constuction.Total Obligations for Antarctic Facilities (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 Actual1FY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES2 The FY 2020 Budget Request for Antarctic Facilities is $ 192.14 million. The reduction relative to FY 2018 is primarily due to one -time investment s made in FY 2018 to replace the aging pier at Palmer Station , funding to advance Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science ( AIMS ) development and design and other miscellaneous improvements. In FY 2020, funds will provide for station operations and science support at NSF's three Antarctic stations, various near and deep field camps, and two leased research vessels. OPP contracts with a prime contractor for science support, operations, the leasing of research vessels, and the maintenance of the Antarctic stations and related infrastructure in New Zealand and Chile. The FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 11 contractor is selected through a competitive process. Rotary and fixed -wing aircraft used in support of research are also provided through separate competitively -awarded co ntracts. Other agencies and contractors provide technical support in areas of expertise such as engineering, construction, and communications. Following a major refurbishment program, the U.S. Coast Guard's Polar Star returned to service in 2014 and provide s annual icebreaking services for the McMurdo Station resupply effort. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: OPP staff, including subject matter experts in operational and scientific disciplines, have overall responsibility for managing Antarctic Facil ities under the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP); NSF budgets for and manages USAP on behalf of th e Nation. This includes planning all activities and overseeing contractors. OPP's Antarctic Sciences section funds merit -reviewed research proposals for which access to Antarctica is essential to advancing the scientific frontiers and that can only be achi eved or are best achieved with research work in/on Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Research is conducted in a broad array of geo - and bio- sciences, including earth system science, and space and astrophysical sciences. The Antarctic Infrastructure and L ogistics section enables research in Antarctica on behalf of the U.S. government through a network of stations, labs, equipment, and logistical resources. External Structure: The Antarctic prime support contract is currently held by Leidos Innovations Corporation. There are many separate subcontractors for supplies and technical services, and other services are procured through separate competitively -bid contracts. Reviews: OPP evaluates the performance of the Antarctic support contractor annually via an A ward Fee Plan, which involves multiple tiers of review, including a Performance Evaluation Board (PEB) composed of representatives from OPP and BFA . In addition, OPP's performance is reviewed externally by Committees of Visitors and the OPP Advisory Committee. The USAP Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) released a report on its review of the program in July 2012. 1 The initial NSF response to the USAP BRP report was released in March 2013 and progress to address recommendations is ongoing .2 This budget request includes a request for funding for the AIMS project, a major part of the NSF response to the BRP report. Current Status All facilities (stations, research vessels, and field camps) are currently operating normally. The USAP BRP report concluded that ushering in a new age of Antarctic science simply by expanding traditional methods of logistical support would be prohibitively costly. Instead, it recommended numerous ways to more efficiently and cost -effectively support research while maintaining high standards of safety and increasing the flexibility to support evolving science foci in the future. For example, construction is underway to upgrade satellite communications systems to support operations and research , and construction activities to repl ace the Palmer Station pier to ensure long- term access to unique research in the peninsula region could begin as early as the 2020 austral summer season . NSF is also constructing a consolidated Information Tec hnology and Communications building. This was p hased to ensure continuous functionality when the AIMS project construction gets underway in FY 2020. 1 www.nsf.gov/od/opp/usap_special_review/usap_brp/rpt/index.jsp 2 www.nsf.gov/od/opp/usap_special_review/usap_brp/rpt/nsf_brp_response.pdf Helicopters provide support to field parties in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in southern Victoria Land and at remote field camps.

Leidos is in the process of complet ing the designs of all construction components, begin ning the site preparation work for the backbone utilities and the initial buildings such as the Vehicle and Equipment Operations Center, and procur ing the first phases of construction equipment and materials . The AIMS project will redevelop McMurdo Station to be a consolidated, cost-effective facility , including modernized utilities distribution and fire protection. For additional information on AIMS see the AIMS narrative in the MREFC Chapter . Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In FY 2012, Lockheed Martin Corporation was awarded a 13.5 year contract, consisting of a five -year base period and four option periods, exercised on the basis of performance, that total an additional eight and a half years. Leidos Innovations Corporation now holds the contract as it acquired the responsible division of Lockheed Martin in 2016. Contracts for fixed and rotary wing support are managed as assisted acquisitions by the Department of Interior, Office of Aviation Services. A five -year contract for helicopter support , currently held by PHI, Inc. of Lafayette, Louisiana , is currently under competition . A five -year contract for fixed -wing aviation services was recently awarded to Kenn Borek Air of Calgary, Canada. U.S. policy directs NSF to maintain a n active and influential presence in Antarctica, including year - round occupation of South Pole Station and two coastal stations. As the scientific forefronts addressed there evolve over time, so do the research emphases at the three stations and the infrastructure needed to support them. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 13 ARECIBO OBSERVATORY (ARECIBO) $4,260,000 1 The FY 2018 Actual includes $1.28 million in additional FY 2018 one- time funding above the requested amount, $2.0 million in supplemental appropriation funding for hurricane repairs, plus $2.69 million for forward funding of FY 2019 operations.Arecibo Observatory Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 Actual1FY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual Arecibo is a center for multidisciplinary research and education with advanced observational facilities. The observatory's principal facility is one of the world's largest single- dish radio/radar telescopes, a 305 -meter diameter reflector located near the town of Arecibo in western Puerto Rico on approximately 140 acres of U.S. Gover nment -owned land. Arecibo is currently operated and managed by the University of Central Florida (UCF) and subrecipients, Yang Enterprises, Inc. (YEI) and Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) , under a cooperative agreement with NSF that began on April 1, 2018 . The observatory serves over 350 users annually with a wide range of research and observing instrumentation in passive radio astronomy, solar system radar astronomy, and space and atmospheric sciences. A peer -review telescope allocation committee provides merit -based telescope time to users. The committee is common to the three fields, but specific subject matter experts from outside the observatory are consulted for reviews. NSF does not provide awards targeted specifically for use of Arecibo, although som e Arecibo users are supported through NSF or NASA grants to pursue scientific programs that require use of the facility. Currently, Arecibo is staffed at about 104 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, of which about 70 are funded by NSF. The remaining FTEs are supported by a grant from NASA, by the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center, and by other funding sources. Staff include approximately 16 scientists who, along with engineers, technicians, and operators, are available to help visit ing investigators with observing programs. In addition, there are management, administrative, and clerical positions, as well as maintenance staff, and several postdoctoral scholars and students. Along with the entire island of Puerto Rico, Arecibo Observ atory was severely impacted by Hurricane Maria, which struck on September 20, 2017. Damages to the facility included the physical infrastructure and scientific equipment. Two generators suffered damage and the other two were overused until commercial power was restored more than two months later. Basic science operations (planetary radar and radio astronomy) restarted within weeks of the storm , although at reduced and degraded performance levels. Funding for observatory repairs was provided in the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2018 (P.L. 115 -123) totaling $16.30 million. Of the total amount provided, $14.30 million was identified for Arecibo of which $2.0 million was disbursed in FY 2018 for the most c ritical immediate concerns including debris cleanup, rewinding of generators, repairs to damaged building infrastructure, engineering analyses, and repairs to the damaged catwalk leading to the 305 -m telescope platform. An award for the remaining $1 2.30 mi llion for more complex repairs, such as to the broken 430 MHz line feed and damage to the supporting steel cables which could impact overall structural integrity, will be made in FY 2019. The remaining repairs will take up to four years, carefully planned to prioritize the most critical structural repairs and to minimize impact to ongoing regular scientific observations.

Of the total amount provided, $14.30 million was identified for Arecibo and $2.0 million was obligated in FY 2018. The remaining $12.30 million will be obligated in FY 2019.2 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends in March 2023.1 The FY 2018 Actual includes $1.80 million in MPS and $890,000 in GEO for forward funding of FY 2019 operations.Total Obligations for Arecibo (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 Actual1FY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES2 Arecibo is jointly supported by the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) and the GEO Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS). B ased on the 2006 AST Senior Review recommendations ,1 AST and AGS reduced support for the Arecibo Observatory . An external review of the AST portfolio was completed in 2012, and an external review of the AGS portfolio was completed in 2016. In 2012, the AST Portfolio Review Committee recommended \"continued AST involvement in Arecibo be re-evaluated later in the decade in light of the science opportunities and budget forecasts at that time.\"2 The National Academies of S ciences, Engineering, and Medicine 's (the National Academies) August 2016 report, New Worlds, New Horizons: A Midterm Assessment , reinforced this, with Recommendation 3.1 noting: \"The NSF should proceed with divestment from ground- based facilities that hav e a lower scientific impact .\"3 The Geospace Section (GS) Portfolio Review Committee was charged by the NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences to review the most promising Geospace science strategies and critical capabilities and to reconcile these with th e science goals described by the 2013 Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics .4 The GS is associated with AGS and its portfolio includes grant programs in upper -atmospheric sciences, space science, and space weather. This GS portfolio review5 was carrie d out using the assumption of an inflation -adjusted, flat budget for GS over the next decade to FY 2026. The GS Portfolio Review Committee recommendations include the reduction of annual AGS Arecibo Observatory funding from $4.10 million to $1.10 million by 2020. GEO commissioned a review from a second panel assembled by the National Academ ies that assessed the process by which the GS Portfolio Review Committee reached its findings and recommendations. The panel published the results of this review 6 in early 2017 and, for Arecibo, reiterated the recommendations of the GS Portfolio Review Committee. NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 15 Because of these potential changes, NSF prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate proposed operational changes at Arecibo due to fundi ng constraints, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. NSF also completed its compliance obligations with the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Endangered Species Act. NSF prepared a Final EIS , which was published in August 2017.7 Following publication of the EIS, NSF published a Record of Decision8 in November 2017, which formalizes the selection of NSF's preferred alternative: to collaborate with interested parties to maintain science- focused operations at the Observatory with reduce d agency funding. NSF issued a solicitation in January 2017 requesting proposals to provide continued operations and management of Arecibo for five years at reduced funding. The planned NSF funding profile presented in the solicitation gradually tapered NSF support to $2.0 million by the fifth year of the award. In February 2018, NSF announced an award to University of Central Florida (UCF) to undertake formal transition activ ities for operations and management responsibilities for Arecibo Observatory in cooperative agreement with NSF . The award continues science- focused operations that will maintain the Observatory's existing research lines of atmospheric, planetary and astronomical research and continue its education and public outreach efforts. Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : Arecibo supplements NSF support with funding provided by other federal and non- federal sources. Since FY 2010, the NASA Near Earth Object Obser vation Program has committed $2.0 million annually to Arecibo for the planetary radar program; this increased to $3.60 million for FY 2013, with more observing time allocated to the NASA program. In FY 2020 NASA support is expected to be approx imately $ 4.65 million . Education and Public Outreach (EPO) : Arecibo hosts a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site, and Ph.D. students receive training through the use of the facility. Over 350 students have participated in REU programs at Arecibo. Arecibo also sponsors a major outreach program in Puerto Rico via the A ngel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center as well as summer workshops for K -12 teachers. This center attracts more than 80,000 visitors each year; over 1.4 million people have visited since its opening in 1997. Approximately 25 percent of these visitors are K -12 students. There was a downturn in visitors immediately following the 2017 hurricanes, but as the island recovered the number of visitors began to return to the expected rates each month. Exhibits at the visitor center were updated, and physical renovations to the visitor center building were completed in FY 2016. These improvements were funded by the Angel Ramos Foundation and the Ana G. M\u00e9ndez University System and were formally approved by NSF. With funds received from the Puerto Rico Department of Educ ation, Arecibo has hosted numerous teacher workshops and has trained approximately 500 teachers. This program integrates formal activities at the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center into the STEM curriculum in Puerto Rico. Arecibo also hosts several meet ings each year within a wide variety of scientific disciplines. 7 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/env_impact_reviews/arecibo/arecibo_feis.jsp 8 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/env_impact_reviews/arecibo/arecibo_rod.jsp An image of the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico.

Major Multi -User Research Facili ties Facilities - 16 Operations and Maintenance : Arecibo administers observing time to the astronomy and aeronomy communities via competitive observing proposals and conducts educational and public outreach programs at all levels. Observing hours among science programs are allocated based on the qualit y of proposals. The telescope is currently oversubscribed, counting ongoing astronomy surveys, new astronomy projects, solar system observations, and atmospheric sciences programs. About 75 percent of astronomy users conduct their observing remotely via ne tworked control software, while radar observations typically employ on- site users. Management and Oversight Funding: AST funding will maintain basic operations costs and science programs in passive radio astronomy. As recommended by the 2006 AST Senior Re view, AST funding for Arecibo has been gradually reduced. AGS funding will support basic operations costs and science programs in aeronomy and space physics, including space weather . NSF Structure: The lead NSF program officer in AST, in close cooperation with a program officer in AGS and in consultation with community representatives, provides ongoing oversight. T he program officers make use of detailed annual program plans, long- range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports , and annual reports submitted by the management and operations awardee. They also attend awardee governance committee meetings, as appropriate. To address issues as they arise, program officers work closely with other NSF offices such as the Office of the General Counsel and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support and the Large Facilities Office in BFA . The MPS Facilities team, together with the Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF), also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. AST and AGS program officers conduct periodic site visits and frequent, regular, teleconferences. External Structure: Management is via a cooperative agreement . In February 2018 NSF announced an award to UCF to undertake formal transition activities leading to U CF assumption of full operations and management responsibilities for Arecibo Observatory. The transition to UCF's management occurred on April 1, 2018. UCF has two sub- awardees: Yang Enterprises, Inc. (YEI) for engineering staff and facilities management and the Univer sidad Metropolitana (UMET) for management of the visitor's center and the education and public outreach efforts. Reviews: In January 2017 , NSF issued a solicitation requesting proposals to provide continued operations and management of Arecibo for five ye ars, but at reduced funding. Proposals received in response to this solicitation were afforded extensive NSF internal review together with formal review by a panel of external experts in observatory management and operations. Additionally, AST and AGS jointly conduct annual external reviews of Arecibo program plans; the most recent such review was held in January 2017. The next formal annual external review of UCF's management is scheduled to take place in the Fall of 2019. Renewal/Recompetition/Terminatio n In January 2017 NSF issued a solicitation for continued operations and management of Arecibo Observatory. Following a thorough review process, in February 2018, NSF announced an award to UCF to undertake formal transition activities expected to lead to U CF assuming full operations and management responsibilities. The current cooperative agreement with UCF for the management of Arecibo was awarded in April 2018, when UCF succeeded the previous managing organization . This followed a competitive process for a new five- year cooperative agreement, consistent with NSB policy. This agreement is in effect through March 2023.

CHESS is a high -intensity, high -energy X -ray facility located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York . It uses synchrotron light given off by charged particles, both electrons and positrons, as they circulate in a ring at nearly the speed of light. This multi- user facility provides X -ray beams for research in physics, chemistry, biology, materials, engineering, and environmental sciences. Emphasis areas include soft matter and thin film studies, solution scattering, nanomaterials, high -pressure science, structural biology, time -resolved studies of materials, and X -ray studies of structural materials. Oversight of the facility is provided through the MPS Division of Materials Research (DMR). As a national user facility , CHESS provides access to beamtime through a competitive proposal review process. The primary function of the staff is to maintain and operate the facility and to assist users from across the United States and overseas. Approximately 1,200 users annually perform a broad array of research including computationally- enabled scattering studies of complex materials, along with analyses of the structure of designer solids and the impact of processing . Scientists use time-resolved synchrotron radiation to enabl e research in engineering of materials, X-ray imaging and spectroscop y, structur al materials under operating conditions , and, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the analysi s of macromolecules and biochemistry. A n annual meeting of users and several workshops help disseminate results from the facility. CHES S supports users from academia, industry, and national laboratories. The facility has developed a dynamic testing station for structural materials through collaboration with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and the Office of Naval Research. Key colla borations include work with Department of Energy (DOE) -supported synchrotron facilities , such as the Advanced Photon Source (APS) , the National Synchrotron Light Source , and the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at Stanford. X -ray detectors developed at C HESS are now in use at third and fourth generation X -ray sources around the world, including LCLS, the world's first hard X -ray laser. Cornell University has just completed an upgrade to CHESS's light source, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). CESR is now a third -generation light source of the same class as the APS. The upgrade, funded by the State of New York , incorporated cost- effective undulators developed at CHESS . The se undulators will increase X -ray flux by order s of magnitude and enable scien tists to pursue time -resolved and high -resolution experiments and imaging not previously possible. The CHESS- developed undulators, and other innovations such as high -flux X -ray optics, are impacting synchrotron science worldwide. Researchers at CHESS also developed a new Kolsky bar apparatus to study the impact of high strain rates on structure using in situ diffraction from metals undergoing shock -wave induced strain. This unique capability uses the high flux in combination with a new high -speed pixel arr ay detector. Understanding high-impact deformation is particularly important to the automotive and aerospace industries. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 18 CHESS supports and enhances Ph.D .-level graduate education, postdoctoral research, and research experiences for undergraduates , K-12 students and science teachers. The education and outreach program annually impacts over 6,000 people of all ages, including over 1,300 visitors touring the Cornell facilities. Each year, about 60 Ph.D. degrees are granted to students who have used the facil ity for their research. CHESS is a key training ground for X -ray and accelerator scientists, with CHESS graduates being hired by other X -ray facilities in the U nited States and around the world. With the recent upgrade to CESR, CHESS is now equipped with a high -energy hard X -ray synchrotron source. In FY 2017, NSF conducted a review of the science case for this upgraded X-ray facility , named CHESS -U, and determined that this upgrade would provide new capability in a niche area at CHESS , but the unique aspects lacked sufficient breadth to justify continued stewardship of the source by NSF. This led to NSF's decision to continue funding CHESS operations only through March 2019 and to accept a transition proposal in FY 2018. CHESS has proposed to establish a new partnership model, whereby NSF would consider targeted support for the most promising science and unique experimental components but no longer support full operation of the source. The initial expiration date of the cooperative agreement was March 2019. NSF has extended the award to August 2019 to allow NSF to complete the transition process . FY 2019 funding for CHESS during this transition includes $15.0 million through August 2019, $10.0 million of which was funded in (BIO) 4.00 - 1.00 - - - - - Operations & Maintenance (ENG) 4.00 - 1.00 - - - - $5.00 $5.00 2018 Actual includes $10.0 million to fund part of FY 2019 costs. 2 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends in August 2019. The process for transition of CHESS from an NSF stewardship to a partnership model began in FY 2018 and should be completed in FY 2019. Future funding is dependent on proposal review. Total Obligations for CHESS (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES2 Management and Oversight NSF Structure: CHESS is supported by MPS through a cooperative agreement with Cornell University. A MPS/DMR program director is the primary contact with the facility. NIH provides additional support for CHESS operations throug h the Macromolecular Diffraction at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) award. A Joint Oversight Group (JOG) was established to better coordinate the CHESS and MacCHESS awards. The JOG serves as a vehicle to keep interested parties inform ed and includes MPS , ENG, BIO, and NIH program directors. The NSF Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) and the Large Facilities Office (LFO) in BFA provide oversight of financial and administrative aspects of the award . The MPS Facilities team, together with the Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF), also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. External structure: The Cornell Laboratory of Accelerator -baSed Sciences and Education (CLASSE), which falls under Cornell's Vi ce Provost for Research, administers CHESS. The principal investigator serves as the CHESS director and reports to the director of CLASSE. The CHESS director receives guidance primarily from an internal executive committee and diversity committee as well as from external groups including the External Advisory Committee and the U sers' E xecutive C ommittee. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 19 Reviews NSF provides oversight by monitoring annual plans and reports including user metrics, as well as by conducting monthly phone conferences with the director. NSF uses annual site visit reviews to assess the user program, in- house research, long -term plans to contribute significant research developments both nationally and internationally, as well as the operations, maintenance, and development of the facility. Annual reviews also assess the status of education, training and outreach ; operations and management efficiency ; and diversity plans. The reviews are conducted by a panel of experts from the research community . Representatives from NIH attend the reviews as observers. In addition to these annual scientific reviews, business reviews are conducted regularly by LFO and DACS . Renewal/Recompetition/Termination With the awarded five -month extension, the new expiration date of the curr ent cooperative agreement is August 2019. Pending the outcome of the proposal to transition to a partnership role , a new award is expected to be in place no later than September 2019. Th is partnership , which NSF will monitor closely, will be for a period of five years. S upport thereafter will depend on successful operation in the p artner ship mode and meritorious review of a renewal proposal .

Gemini North sits atop Mauna kea, Hawai 'i at an elevation of 4,200 meters, while Gemini South is located on the 2,700- mete r summit of Cerro Pach\u00f3n, Chile . Both telescopes offer a suite of modern optical and infrared instrumentation and employ sophisticated adaptive optics technology to compensate for the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere. Among the fundamental questions being investigated at Gemi ni are those pertaining to the age and rate of expansion of the universe, the origin of the \"dark energy\" that drives cosmic acceleration, the nature of non-luminous matter, the processes that give rise to the formation and evolving structures of galaxies, and the birth of stars and their planetary systems. Technological advances incorporated into the design of the two telescopes optimize their imaging capabilities and infrared performance as well as their ability to quickly swap instruments in response to changing atmospheric conditions. Gemini's flexible observing modes make it ideal for reacting rapidly to opportunities that arise in the new er a of multi -messenger astronomy . Gemini is also developing software and hardware aimed at enhancing its ability to respond to the expected growth in demand for observations needed to characterize objects discovered by NSF facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) , the Laser (LIGO) , and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The research agencies that currently form the Gemini international partnership include: NSF ; the National Research Council of Canada ; the Minist\u00e9rio da Ci\u00eancia, Tecnologia e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o of e Innovac i\u00f3n Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y Tecnol\u00f3gica of Chile ; and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute of South Korea , which joined the partnership in July 2018. These six agenc ies are signatories to the Gemini International Agreement , which current ly covers January 2016 through December 2021. Renewal of this agreement beyond 2021 is currently under negotiation, with all participants expressing their inten tions to remain in the partnership. Gemini helps educate astronomy and engineering students through undergraduate internship programs in both Hawai 'i and Chile. Gemini also provides an engaging focal point for public outreach and student training in all of the partner countries. Gemini -sponsored activitie s attract students and teachers at all levels of elementary through high school education. The unique Gemini -led Journey Through the Universe progra m in Hilo, Hawai 'i (now in its 1 5 th year) and its sister activity, Viaje al Universo in La Serena, Chile, bring astrono my into the classroom through week -long annual event s that involve dozens of astronomers from Gemini as well as from many of the other astronomical facilities at each location. Gemini staff also provide guidance and support to the 'Imiloa Astron omy Center, a public facility in Hilo that seeks to advance the integration of science and indigenous culture through education. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 21 The observatory supports four facility -class instruments at each telescope as well as a vigorous visiting instrument program . Each telescope is equipped with adaptive o ptics and l aser guide star systems which greatly improve the ability to correct for atmos pheric blurring. The unique M ulti-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) system on Gemini South provides near-infrared images that are often sharper than those observed from space, cover ing a field -of-view on the sky that is wider than any competing system on the ground. With support from NSF, the observatory is developing a similar capability for Gemini Nor th. Together, these two MCAO systems will provide the Gemini community with this unique capability over both hemispheres. The Gemini South telescope in Chile firing its laser into the night sky (left). The laser produces a \"constellation\" of five synthetic guide stars (center) that are used to correct for atmospheric blurring. The Gemini observation (on the right ) of a Globul ar Cluster shows an example of an image sharpened in this way. Credit: Gemini Observatory/NSF/AURA . The observatory is developing a number of new imagers and spectrometers. Instrument development is funded by the partners as a portion (typically 10 percent) of their annual operations contributions. These instrumentation funds are currently being used to build the Gemini High -resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST), a workhors e instrument for studying a vast array of astronomical objects , and an eight -beam optical/infrared spectrograph known as SCORPIO. SCORPIO will be used to characterize exotic transient phenomena discovered with LSST, LIGO, and other time -domain facilities in the 2020s. Two other major instruments are being designed and built by Gemini partners : the Gemini InfraRed Multi -Object Spectrograph, GIRMOS (Canada ), and a successor to a hugely popular visiting instrument, the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph, IGRINS (South Korea and the U nited States ). Together these four instruments will greatly enhance Gemini's capabilities well into the next decade, ensuring the observatory stays at the forefront of astronomical research in all areas . Construction of the te lescopes and their instrumentation involved a large number of industrial entities in several countries, with areas of specialization that included large and complex optical systems, engineering, electronics, electro -mechanical systems, and computing. Conti nued development in these areas is reflected in the instrumentation and facilities renewal activities that are incorporated into the overall budget. The U.S. share of Gemini Observatory observing time is open to proposals from any researcher in the U.S. astronomical community, with peer -review committees providing merit- based telescope time. NSF does not provide awards targeted specifically for the use of Gemini , although U.S. users are often supported through separate NSF research awards to pursue scienti fic programs that require the use of the observatory. In a typical year, approximately 600 unique observing programs are submitted to Gemini, 70 percent of which are from U.S. -based astronomers. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 22 In the FY 2020 Budget Request, NSF plans to maintain full operations of Gemini Observatory through the entire fiscal year. The Budget Request of $20.28 million includes the full contribution of the NSF (U.S.) share of facility operations costs. Due to recently provided funding for facility upgrades, t he requested budget does not include any NSF (U.S.) contribution to the Gemini Instrument Development Fund (IDF), which is obtained through partner contributions that typically have been 10.0 percent of annual operations contributions in recent $20.28 $22.98 million in additional FY 2018 one-time funding above the requested 1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends December 2022.Total Obligations for Gemini (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES1FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 Request Facility Upgrades: In FY 2018, NSF awarded $13.0 million for support of three related projects: (1) the development of a state -of-the-art MCAO system for Gemini North, (2) software improvements needed to optimize Gemini's capabil ity for rapid time -domain follow -up of transient sources and alerts for multi - messenger astronomy (MMA), and (3) p ublic information and outreach activities focused on MMA . Management and Oversight Governance Structure: The observatory is governed by the Gemini Board, which was established by the Gemini International Agreement signed by the six participating agencies mentioned above . This board meets at least twice a year and acts as the primary forum for interactions and decisions among the participant s in the Gemini Agreement; the Gemini Board ensure s that Gemini is managed and operated in accordance with the Agreement and is the body with overall budgetary and policy control over the observatory. The Gemini Board is supported by two sub -committees, th e Gemini Finance Committee (GFC) and the Gemini Science and Technology Advisory Committee (STAC). NSF serves as the Executive Agency for the partnership, carrying out the project on their behalf. The U nited States holds six of the 1 4 seats on the Gemini Bo ard; NSF appoints the five non- NSF U.S. members. Managing Organization: The Gemini Observatory is currently managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) on behalf of the partnership through a cooperative agreement with NSF. The current cooperative agreement covers January 2017 to December 2022. AURA conducts its own management reviews through oversight committees. NSF Structure: NSF has one seat on the Gemini Board, currently occupied by the AST program officer responsi ble for Gemini programmatic oversight. An other NSF staff member serves as Board executive secretary . The program officer monitors operations and development activities at the observatory, nominates U.S. scientists to Gemini advisory committees, conducts re views on behalf of the partnership, participates in various Board sponsored sub- committees, and approves funding actions, reports, and contracts . The program officer is also currently the chair of the GFC. To address issues as they arise, AST has a dedicat ed Integrated Project Team (IPT) which includes representatives from other NSF offices, such as the Office of General Counsel, OISE, and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support and the Large Facilities Office in BFA . The MPS Facilities team, to gether with the Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF), also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. Reviews: In addition to the oversight activities of the Gemini Board and its subcommittees, NSF conducts periodic reviews of the management and operation of the observatory, and of AURA's FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 23 financial systems. The IPT reviews quarterly operations, development, and financial plans, and also the observatory's annual progress report and program operations and development plan for the coming year. NSF conducted a Business System Review (BSR) of the observatory and AURA's centralized administrative services in 2013. In April 2017, NSF conducted a Gemini Accounting System Audit, and plans to conduct a n Incurred Cost Audit of the Gemini cooperative agreement and a new BSR in 2019 or early 2020. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The United Kingdom withdrew from the Gemini partnership at the end of 2012, resulting in about a 24 percent budget reduction for overall facility management and operations . More recently, Australia, a 6.3 percent partner in 2015, first moved to a limited -term collaboration and then ceased involvement entirely in late 2017. The Republic of Korea ha d a similar limited -term, year -to-year arrangement for a four- year period through the end o f 2018, though has since become a full Participant in the Gemini International Agreement. With a 5.0 percent share, Korea has essentially replaced the loss in revenue incurred w hen Australia left the partnership . The current Agreement between the six Gemini Participants expires in December 2021. At a recent A ssessment Point (November 2018 ), all Participants in the Agreement expressed their desire to remain in the partnership at current participation levels beyond December 2021. The details of a new Agreement are to be established over the next two to three years. Re-competition of the management and operation of Gemini was last conducted in 2014- 2015. The National Science Board authorized a new cooperative agreement with AU RA in February 2016 that covers January 2017 through December 2022. Depending on the success of the National Center for Op tical-Infrared Astronomy (see section on National Optical Astronomy Observatory in this chapter ), NSF will determine in FY 2020 whether to recompete the Gemini management, renew the cooperative agreement, or extend the cooperative agreement to facilitate its integration into the National Center for Optical -Infrared Astronomy and a future management competition. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 24 GEODETIC FACILITY FO R THE ADVANCEMENT $12,640,000 OF GEOSCIENCE (GAGE) -$20,000 / $12.64 -0.2%(Dollars Millions)Geodetic for FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual GAGE comprises a distributed, multi -user, national facility for the development, deployment, and operational support of modern geodetic instrumentation to serve national goals in basic research and education in the Earth sciences. GAGE focus es on studies of Earth's surface deformation at many scales with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. GAGE facilities support fundamental re search and discovery on continental deformation, plate boundary processes, the earthquake cycle, the geometry and dynamics of magmatic systems, continental groundwater storage, and hydrologic loading. GAGE is managed and operated for NSF by UNAVCO, a consortium of 119 U.S. universities and non- profit institutions with research and teaching programs in geophysics and geodesy and 111 associate members from foreign institutions. GAGE was formed in late FY 2013 from the geodetic component of the EarthScope faci lity and related geodetic facilities previously managed by UNAVCO. The FY 2020 Budget Request will enable GAGE to continue to provide key services for the geoscience research community, including global and regional observing networks, field and technical support for experiments worldwide, data management and distribution systems, and other related activities. Over the last three decades, the Earth science research community has greatly refined our ability to determine the position and motion of points on Earth's surface using space geodetic techniques, enabling high-resolution studies of Earth processes in a wide range of fields. Space geodesy applications are extremely broad and expanding to include important societal research on earthquake and tsunami hazards, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, coastal subsidence, wetlands health, soil moisture, groundwater distribution, and space weather. Applications of geodetic techniques to understand the complex interplay between climate dynamics, continental ice sheet and mountain glacier dynamics, crustal isostatic adjustments, and sea level change are of foremost relevance to current global issues confronting humanity. $12.64 1 Outyear estimates are for planning purposes only. Total Obligations for GAGE (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES1 To serve the research needs of the broad Earth science community, GAGE is organized under three primary service areas: Geodetic Infrastructure Currently, t he Network of the Americas (NOTA) includes 1,257 continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations ( more than 800 of which transmit data in real -time with sub -second latency) distributed across the U.S. , Mexico, and the Caribbean , with focus on the active plate boundaries . The FY2020 request includes funds support a network that includes about 1100 sta tions. The GAGE facility also provides operational and maintenance support for a network of 76 borehole FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 25 strainmeters and 79 borehole seismometers deployed along the San Andreas Fault and above the Cascadia subd uction zone and volcanic arc. Tiltmeters ( 26) and pore pressure sensors (23) are also collocated with the other borehole instruments. Together, data collected by these instruments enable scientists to study the full range of deformation in the solid Earth, from the rapid shaking associated with earthquakes, through more gradual motions related to slow slip events on faults and to Earth's evolving water cycles, up to long -term plate tectonics. Global geodetic arrays outside of the NOTA footprint are supported by GAGE in partnership with investigators. Eight hundred continuous GPS stations from over 60 networks around the world are now maintained and monitored, and have their data compiled into the GAGE data system. In addition, GAGE provides operational and maintenance support for 58 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) -supported stations, and the GNSS network that supports satellite orbit and clock corrections and the refinement of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF ). The ITRF is the foundation for high -precision global Earth science and other applications of geodesy such as land surveying. Community GPS /GNSS receiver and geodetic technology pool consists of over 700 GPS and GNSS receivers, ancillary equi pment, and six terrestrial laser scanners, which can be used by investigators for short - and long -term deployments on research projects supported via multiple Earth and Polar Programs science programs funded by NSF. GAGE supports the polar GPS network in A ntarctica (ANET) and development of specialized GPS monumentation, power, and telemetry solutions for use in harsh environments. GAGE also provides portable campaign deployment geodetic instrumentation, training, and field support for experiments in the po lar regions. Investigator Project Support includes project management, field engineering, and technical support services to plan and execute GPS surveys and permanent station installations. GAGE also maintains a staff focused on geodetic technology equipme nt testing services to evaluate new geodetic technologies and improve performance for science applications. Geodetic Data Services Geodetic Data Services manages an archive of over 300 terabytes of data from GPS, laser scanning, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and borehole geophysical instruments from all GAGE components including NOTA, global continuous geodetic networks, and campaign GPS observations; operates automated and manual syst ems to ensure the quality of all data stored in the archive; and provides systems to give the national and international research community timely access to these data. The archive of SAR imagery maintained and distributed by GAGE to support interferometr ic SAR imagery of continuous surface deformation at scales of 100 km to 1,000 km is complementary to discrete GPS measurement of displacement. UNAVCO, as the manager of GAGE, brokers for cost - effective community access to the SAR imagery acquired by foreig n SAR satellite systems. In the last quarter of FY 2018, more than 5,000 unique users downloaded data from the GAGE archive. These data enable the wide range of Earth science studies described above. Education and Community Engagemen t The GAGE Education and Community Engagement program enables audiences beyond geodesists to access and use geodetic data and research for educational purposes, including technical short courses, student internships, web- based materials, and programs for strengthening workforce development and improving diversity in the geosciences. Scientific community activities include scientific and technical workshops that bring together the international geodetic community and publications designed to communicate GAGE activities a nd results to the community. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 26 External affairs maintains outreach efforts to policymakers and planning for coordination with the international geodesy community. In addition to its role in providing observational data essential for basic Earth science research, GAGE also plays a significant role providing geodetic infrastructure support to NASA investigators and the international community by maintaining the Global GNSS Network (GGN) . GGN supports the refinement of the ITRF and corrections to satellite orbi ts and clocks, all contributing to the capability for millimeter - level geodetic positioning, subtle observations of Earth's time -varying gravity field, and detection of millimeter -level changes in sea level. Commercial surveyors and engineering firms down load GAGE facility real- time GPS data daily to support precision positioning which is now a mainstay of their industry . GPS is also used extensively for terrestrial and marine navigation both commercially and by the general public. The economic impact of access to these data has not been quantified but is clearly substantial. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) in GEO, through its Instrumentation and Facilities program, provides general oversight of GAGE to assure effective performance and administration. The program also facilitates coordination of GAGE programs and projects with other NSF-supported facilities and projects, and with other federal agencies, and evaluates and reviews the performance of UNAVCO in manag ing and operating GAGE. In addition, an I ntegrated P roject Team consisting of representatives from EAR, Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support , and the Large Facilit ies Office work with the cognizant program officer in addressing challenges and identifying potential barriers for success. The EAR Division Director and Integrated Activities S ection Head provide other internal oversight. External Structure: GAGE is managed and operated by UNAVCO, which is incorporated as a non- profit consortium repres enting 119 U.S. universities and non- profit organizations with research and teaching programs that rely on geodetic technologies for Earth Science research. Each voting member institution of the Consortium appoints a member representative, and these member representa tives elect the nine members of the UNAVCO Board of Directors, seven of which are drawn from member institutions, and two directors -at-large. The board members, who serve two -year terms, vet all internal program decisions associated with GAGE management an d operation, through consultation with UNAVCO staff and GAGE advisory committees (one for each major GAGE component and additional ad hoc working groups appointed for special tasks). The Board of Directors appoints a president of UNAVCO to a renewable two -year term. The president is responsible for UNAVCO operations, all of which are managed through the UNAVCO Corporate Headquarters in Boulder, Colorado. Reviews: In FY 2019 EAR will conduct a joint review of the data services activities of GAGE and its seismic facility counterpart Seismological Facility for the Advancement of GEoscience (SAGE). Renewal/Recompetition/Termination A successful NSF merit review of the proposal for the GAGE facility took place in 2017 and 2018, and funding for the current GAGE cooperative agreement began in FY 2019 and it will end in FY 2023. In preparation for the next recompetition that will begin in FY 2022, NSF will be engaging in two separate activities. First, NSF has requested the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, through the decadal study \" Catalyzing Opportunities for Research in Earth Sciences \" 1, to explore different models to manage geophysical capabilities to serve the Earth Sciences community. Second, NSF will convene an interagency working group to identify the needs other agencies have for the capabilities currently provided by SAGE and GAGE. The information from these two activities will be used to draft the solicitation requesting proposals to support geophysical capabilities for Earth Science s research and education. 1 www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=51287 FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress ICECUBE NEUTRINO ERVATORY over FY 2018 Actual IceCube is the world's first high- energy neutrino observatory and is located deep within the ice cap under the U.S. Amundsen- Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. With the discovery in 2013 of the very high- energy (PeV) neutrinos from beyond our solar system, the Observatory has demonstrated that it represents a new window on the universe, providing unique data on the engines that power active galactic nuclei, the origin of high -energy cosmic rays, the nature of gamma ray bursts, the activities surrounding supermassive black holes, and other violent and energetic astrophy sical processes. The energy and arrival direction of high-energy neutrinos ranging in energy from 100 GeV to 10 PeV (1 GeV is 109 electron Volts [eV]; eV; and are derived from the IceCube data stream. The IceCube collaboration has recently focused on studies of neutrino events with a deposited energy of 1 TeV and above . The number of neutrinos , detected by IceCube in the range between 100 TeV and 10 PeV has already exceeded 150, and so will provide a statistically robust basis for determining the extrasolar neutrino flux. Approximately one cubic kilometer of ice is instrumented with photo- multiplier (PM) tubes to detect neutrino- induced, charged reaction pr oducts that are produced when a high-energy neutrino interacts in the ice within or near the cubic kilometer fiducial volume. Since completion in 2010, the IceCube detector has been taking data in its final configuration with an uptime of well over 99 perc ent. To handle the high data rates, initial analysis of the data is performed by a cluster of computers housed in a two -story building placed on top of the array. The filtered data is sent over geostationary satellites to the IceCube Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. The Observatory includes a Deep Core Array (DCA) with tightly spaced digital optical modules to detect lower energy neutrinos (down to about 10 GeV), thus opening the door to studies of neutrino oscillation measurements below 250 GeV. The DCA closes the energy gap between the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and the Super -Kamiokande detector in Japan, and allows effective observations of high- energy neutrinos entering from the sky of the southern hemisphere. IceCube high energy neutrino observations recently helped to reveal a source for the first time ever, of very high energy cosmic rays. An IceCube telegram on September 22, 2017, report ed a well -reconstructed track of a ~290 TeV extraterrestrial muon neutrino that pointed to the location of a bright flaring blazar (a quasi - stellar radio source associated with a supermassive black hole at the center of an active giant galaxy ).

The science collaboration is much broader, currently consisting of over 300 scienti sts from 23 U.S. institutions and 24 institutions in 11 other countries (Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). NSF's foreign partners contribute a pro rata share of operations and maintenance costs based on the number of PhD -level researchers involved. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: Oversight of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the joint responsibility of the OPP and MPS's Division of Physics ( PHY). Support for operations and maintenance, research and education, and outreach are shared by OPP and PHY, as well as other external organizations and international partners. NSF provides oversight through regular site visits by NSF managers and externa l reviewers. External Structure: The UW management structure for IceCube includes leadership by the project's principal investigator supported by the director of operations and two associate directors (one for science and instrumentation and one for educat ion and outreach). A Collaboration spokesperson is selected by the Collaboration from the senior international scientific leaders for a two- year term, with an option to be renewed once for at most four consecutive years. At lower levels, project management includes international collaboration representatives, as well as participation by staff at collaborating U.S. institutions. UW has in place an external Scientific Advisory Committee and a Software and Computing Advisory Panel that meet annually and provide written advice to the project. UW leadership, including the Chancellor, provides additional awardee -level oversight. Operations Costs Full operations and maintenance in support of scientific research began in FY 2011. The associated costs are and will continue to be shared by the partner funding agencies U.S. (NSF) and non- U.S. proportional to the number of PhD researchers involved (55:45) . The current NSF award for operations and maintenance constitutes the bulk of the U.S. contribution to general oper ation of the facility. In addition, work in support of facility operations is performed by students, postdocs, and senior researchers who are participating in research on the data produced by the Observatory. Approximately $4.0 million annually is provided in NSF support for U.S. institutions working on more refined and specific data analyses, data interpretation (theory support), and instrumentation upgrades is provided in response to merit -reviewed proposals , through research grants. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 29 The general operat ions of South Pole Station, reported in the Antarctic Facilities and Operations narrative, also contribute to supporting IceCube. The cost of IceCube operations shown in the table herein includes only those that are project -specific and incremental to general South Pole Station operations. The expected operational lifespan of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is 25 years, beginning in FY 2011. Education and Outreach IceCube provides a vehicle for helping to achieve U.S. and NSF education and outreach goals. Specific outcomes include the education and training of future leaders in astrophysics, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates; K -12 teacher scientific and professional development, including development of new inquiry- based learning materials and use of the South Pole environment to convey the excitement of astrophysics and science generally to K -12 students; increased opportunity for involvement of students in international collaborations; increased dive rsity in science through partnerships with minority serving institutions; and enhanced public understanding of science through broadcast media and museum exhibits (such as the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Illinois) based on IceCube science and the South P ole environment. NSF supports evaluation and measurement -based education and outreach programs under separate grants to universities and other organizations that are selected following standard NSF merit review. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination NSF re -competed the IceCube operations and maintenance award in FY 2016. The new award was issued on April 1, 2016 for 60 months. The award 's mid -term panel review is currently scheduled for March 2019 and will provide an important basis for future recompetition co nsiderations .

The IODP represents an international partnership of the scientists, research institutions, and funding organizations of 23 nations to explore the evolution, structure, and behavior of Earth as recorded in the ocean basins. The program management structure focuses on maximizing facility efficiency, while retaining the intellectual cooperation and exchange with NSF's international partners. NSF, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan, and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) continue to provide drilling platforms. The IODP platforms provide sediment and rock samples (cores); in -situ monitoring, sampling, and measurement from borehole observatories; shipboard and shore -based descriptive and analytical facilities; down -hole geophysical and geochemical measurements (logging); and opportunities to conduct experiments to determine in- situ c onditions beneath the sea $45.80 1 Outyear are for planning purposes only. Total Obligations for IODP (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES1 Annual operations and maintenance support for operating the JOIDES Resolution , the most -used IODP platform, represents NSF's primary contribution to the program. The JOIDES Resolution is leased from an offshore drilling contractor under a long -term contract. Due to the long lead- time in planning IODP science expeditions, t he FY 2020 Request of $4 5.80 million for operations and maintenance of the JOIDES Resolution will support up to f our expeditions per year in the ship's calendar year 2022 schedule. The exact number and the complexity of the expeditions will be determined when the final FY 2020 Appropriation information becomes available. Another commer cial contractor provides down -hole-logging services. Databases and core repositories, preparing scientific publications emerging from JOIDES Resolution IODP expeditions, and management of international program proposal review through the IODP Science Support Office, represent additional NSF IODP science integration costs, made at minimal cost to NSF because of international contributions to the program. NSF also provides support for U.S. scientists to sail on IODP drilling platforms and to participate in IO DP advisory panels through an associated program. The annual costs for the associated science integration and science support (not included in the table above) for FY 2019 are projected to be approximately $8.50 million, funded separately through the Divis ion of Ocean Sciences (OCE) . The IODP scientific program emphasizes the following research themes: Climate and Ocean Change: Reading the Past, Informing the Future; Biosphere Frontiers: Deep Life, Biodiversity, and Environmental Forcing of Ecosystems; Earth Connections: Deep Processes and Their Impact on Earth's Surface Environment; and Earth in Motion: Processes and Hazards on Human Time Scales. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 31 The umbrella IODP Forum provides a venue for all IODP entities to exchange ideas and views on the scientific pr ogress of the program. In the current IODP, each drillship is governed by independent facility boards, each of which is unique and optimized for their respective drilling platform. In the case of the JOIDES Resolution Facility Board (JRFB), two advisory pa nels review proposals and provide science and safety advice. A U.S. scientist leads the JFRB, with other members from the scientific community, funding agencies, and the facility operator. The other IODP platforms use the JRFB advisory panels for drilling proposal review. IODP participants include the United States, Japan, ECORD (Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), Brazil, the People's Re public of China, Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand, with all participants except Japan providing financial contributions to JOIDES Resolution operations. Japan provides program support through substantial investment in Chikyu operations, with U.S. a nd Japanese scientists enjoying reciprocal rights on each drilling vessel, and through curation of JOIDES Resolution core samples at Japan's Kochi Core Center. The importance of scientific ocean drilling is underscored by these remarkable facts\u2014 since its inception, scientists from 98 countries have participated, resulting in more than 35,000 publications of which more than 11,000 were peer -reviewed, and more than 700 theses and dissertations. U.S. scientists serve as first authors on about 40 percent of the papers currently being published. U.S. scientists from over 150 universities, government agencies, and industrial research laboratories participate in the program . Samples and data have been distributed to well over 1,000 additional U.S. scientists. Scie ntists from these groups propose and participate in IODP cruises, are members of the program's advisory panels and groups, and supply data for planning expeditions and interpretation of drilling results. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: OCE in GEO manages IODP operations of the JOIDES Resolution and the IODP Science Support Office under the NSF Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) . NSF's ODP is located within the Integrative Programs Section, with one Program Director dedicated to its oversight. The Program Director has responsibility for t hree cooperative agreements supporting IODP: JOIDES Resolution operations ; IODP Science Support Office ; and the IODP U.S. Science Support Program (USSSP). External Structure: NSF provides the JOIDES Resolution as the light IODP drillship through a cooperative agreement with Texas A&M University. MEXT provides the Chikyu as the heavy IODP drillship through the Japan Agency for Marine -Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), while the British Geological Survey manages ECORD drilling contributions through single -use Mission -Specific Platforms. Each entity providing an IODP drilling platform is responsible for sample and data storage, publications, and other science costs associated with the respective platform operations. IODP JOIDES Resolution operations are determined by the JRFB, using advice and recommendations provided by the Science Evaluation Panel (SEP) and the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP). Representation on the panels is determined by contribution level to JOIDES Resolution operations and exchange with other facility boards. NSF is a member of the JRFB. Reviews: Performance of the JOIDES Resolution facility is reviewed yearly by an NSF panel , in consultation with the JRFB. Substantive review of management performance regarding JOIDES Resolution operations occur red in the third year of the cooperative agreement (FY 2017) to guide potential renewal or re -competition decisions. Review of scientif ic progress in broader thematic areas is conducted under the authority of the IODP Forum. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 32 Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In FY 2013, to facilitate support for drilling proposal review, advisory panel meeting logistics, and other integrative activities for scientists participating in IODP activities (e.g. , websites), the University of California, San Diego was selected, through a competitive merit -review process , to host the the IODP Science Support Office through award of a five -year (FY 2014\u2014FY 2018) cooperative agreement. In January 2018, following external merit -review of a renewal proposal, NSF award ed a 5-year cooperative agreement for continued su pport of this Office through FY 2023. In FY 2014, through a competitive process, Texas A&M University was selected to be the JOIDES Resolution Science O perator (JRSO) under a five -year (FY 2015\u2014FY 2019) cooperative agreement which may be renewed for a second five -year period subject to successful performance. This cooperative agreement contain s language encouraging the awardee to facilitate novel partnerships involving support of JOIDES Resolution operations between the U.S. scientific drilling community and commercial industry, thereby providing new intellectual opportunities and potential redu ction in overall facility cost. The National Science Board in February 2019 authorized the NSF Director, at her discretion, to enter into a new cooperative agreement from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2023. In FY 2015, to facilitate support for U.S. scientists participating on IODP platforms (i.e., salary and travel support) and for U.S. IODP education and outreach efforts, a new cooperative agreement was awarded, after external merit -review , to the Lamont -Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University for operation of the U.S. Science Support Program for a five -year period (FY 2015\u2014FY 2019). NSF has initiated the external merit- review process for considering a five- year renewal of the award. JOIDES Resolution underway for science expedi Gabriel Tagliard FY 2020 Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 33 LARGE HADRON COLLIDE R (LHC ) - ATLAS AND CMS Hadron Collider Funding in 2018 Actual1FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual The LHC , an international project at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN ) laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, is the most powerful particle accelerator ever constructed. It produces the highest energy particle beams ever created at a laboratory , making it the premier facility in the world for research in elementary particle physics. The LHC consists of a superconducting particle accel erator, approximately 16.5 miles in circumference, providing two counter -rotating proton beams with a design energy of seven TeV ( one TeV=1012 electron volts) per beam. It can also provide colliding beams of heavy ions, such as lead. Major \"high luminosity\" upgrade s to the ac celerator and detectors are planned to be installed during a suspension in operation that is planned for 2024- 2025 to significantly enhance performance of the accelerator and detectors to gather more than ten times the total amount of data collected previously . Four large particle detectors collect the data delivered by the LHC. They characterize the reaction products from high -energy proton- proton and heavy ion beam collisions. These are analyzed to investigate the fundamenta l properties of matter. More than 45 international funding agencies provide support for scientists to participate in experiments at the LHC. Participating scientists have self-organize d into distinct scientific collaborations to operate each of the detecto rs at the LHC. U.S. participation in the LHC scientific program is defined by Memoranda of Understanding and supporting agreements between NSF, the Department of Energy ( DOE ), and CERN. CERN is responsible for carrying out the overall LHC program goals of operation and maintenance, planning and implementing upgrades to the accelerator, detectors, and research infrastructure, and achieving scientific goals. As the host laboratory, CERN is responsible for coordinating international participation in the LHC pr ogram . The U .S., through a partnership between the DOE and NSF, made major contributions to the construction and operation of the A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detectors , two large general -purpose particle detectors at the LHC , while NSF additionally supports a stron g research team , of modest size , who participate in the LHCb experiment , a special purpose detector that focuses on studying the properties of elementary particles containing b and anti -b quarks . Researchers funded by NSF and DOE comprise the U.S .-ATL AS and U.S .- CMS collaborations, while the U.S.- LHCb collaboration is supported only by NSF. Currently, about 1,270 U.S. researchers participate in the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, including more than 100 post -doctoral fellows and about 450 students , of whom more than 250 are undergraduates . They comprise about 25 percent of the total membership of each international collaboration. NSF supports about 20 percent of the U.S. ATLAS and CMS contingent (plus about 30 of the 1 ,282 members of the LHCb collaboration). LHC data have resulted in major scientific discoveries. Foremost of these was the July 2012 announcement by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations of the discovery of a particle having properties consistent with th e long- sought Higgs boson, a prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics. Its existence was a prediction of the theoretical framework describing the origin of the masses of elementary particles. The experimental confirmation of this theory at the LHC led to the award of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics to Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs. In 2018, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced observations of Higgs bosons coupling to pairs of top and bottom quarks. Observing these extremely rare process es is a significant milestone for the field of High -Energy Physics as it allows physicists to test critical parameters Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 34 of the Higgs mechanism in the St andard Model . The new result s may also provide insight into one of the most puzzling aspects of the Standard Model: the wide range of masses among fermions, the class of particles that constitute matter and includes quarks and leptons. This analysis relied on the abundant data produced to confirm , with overwhelming statistical significance, that the strengths of these couplings are consistent with the predictions of the Standard M odel. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations continue to search for evidence of new physical phenomena beyond the Standard Model. The overall LHC research program includes searches for pa rticles predicted by various proposed extensions to the S tandard Model. These searches utilize the Higgs boson as a tool for discovery : investigating how it interacts with itself , searching for its possible coupling to dark matter , and scrutinizing the dat a for anomalies indicative of unanticipated phenomena . Despite no conclusive signs of new physics so far, the experimental results to date have helped tighten constraints on different models and possibilities, homing in on the most exciting areas of investigation ahead. Further accumulation of data enables these investigations to be carried out with ever -greater precision as researchers look for small , but statistically significant , deviations of measurements from theoretical predictions. This FY 202 0 Budget Request f or the NSF LHC program f unds operation and upgrade planning activities by U.S. university -based researchers participating in high energy physics at the LHC. In FY 2018, LHC operations were reduced by $2.0 million while planning for the hig h luminosity upgrade was underway. In FY 2020, HL-LHC planning will have been completed and construction will begin; as LHC resumes full - time operations, the $2 .0 million is restored and an additional $2.0 million is provided to cover anticipated increases in operations $20.00 Development & - Total $32.46 $20.00 $20.00 $20.00 $7.50 million of funding for FY 2019 and FY 2020 HL-LHC development and design. No additional funds are expected in these years.1 Outyear estimates are for planning purposes only. The cur rent cooperative agreements end in December 2021 (CMS) and January 2022 (ATLAS) .Total Obligations for LHC (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES1FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 Request A world -wide cyber -infrastructure, the LHC grid, is dedicated to LHC data processing, allowing scientists to remotely access and analyze vast data sets. The U.S .-ATLAS and U.S .-CMS collaborations continue to lead the development and exploitation of distributed computing within their respective international collaborative efforts. The LHC grid and the Tier 2 computing centers funded by NSF enable the researchers at 92 U.S. univers ities and five national laboratories to access LHC data and computing resources and thus train students in both state -of-the-art science and computational techniques. The High Energy Physics Advisory Panel, through the May 2014 report of its Particle Phy sics Project Prioritization Panel, recommended to DOE and NSF that the highest priority strategic goal for the U.S. particle physics research program, within a global context, should be continued support for involvement in the LHC program . Within the scope of supported activities, they recommended including the planned high luminosity upgrades which will increase the luminosity , or proton- proton interaction rate, tenfold. This will necessitate significant enhancements to the detectors to exploit this scient ific opportunity. NSF has been working with the U .S.-ATLAS and U.S. -CMS collaborations to plan for a possible contribution to this upgrade. Supplemental funds provided through the LHC operations award in FY 2016- FY 2018 enabled FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 35 the U.S.-ATLAS and U.S. -CMS collaborations to undertake significant preconstruction planning . This resulted in a robust project definition that is the basi s for the MREFC funding request. These supplemental funds also enable ongoing activities intended to prepare and complete constru ction -ready planning . Subject to final NSB authorization , NSF proposes to begin funding elements of the high luminosity detector upgrades to ATLAS and CMS in FY 2020 if construction funding (requested in the MREFC section of this year's NSF Budget Request ) is appropriated. Through the participation of young investigators, undergraduate and graduate students, and minority institutions , the U.S.- LHC program serves the goal of helping to produce a diverse, globally -oriented workforce of scientists and engineers. Innovative education and outreach activities allow high school teachers and students to participate in this project. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: A program director in the MPS Division of Physics is responsible for day -to-day project oversight. The Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support in BFA provides financial and administrative support. An Integrated Project Team, with r epresentatives from MPS, experience d program officers from other d irectorates within NSF , the Large Facilities Office (LFO) and other divisions in BFA , contribute s to the planning and oversight activities supporting NSF's FY 2020 Request for MREFC funding to commence constructing the high- luminosity detector upgrades. The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF), also provide high-level guidance, support, and oversight. External Structure: U.S. program management occurs through a Joint Oversight Group (JOG), created by NSF and DOE. The JOG has the responsibility to see that the U.S.- LHC program is effectively managed and executed to meet commitments made under the LHC international agreement and its protocols. NSF operations support is provided through cooperative agreements with Princeton University for U .S. CMS and with Stony Brook University for U .S. ATLAS. Reviews: NSF and DOE conduct separate and joint external reviews of operation and detector upgrade activities so that each agency is fully cognizant of the activities of the other partner. Two joint review meetings per year assess operational performance, scientific and financial status, management issues, and plans for fu ture activities. The most recent JOG was held in October 2018. The next major joint review w ill be held in June 2019 . NSF also conduct s external reviews of planning for the proposed high luminosity upgrades. The Final Design Reviews are scheduled to be hel d in September 2019. In addition, business reviews are conducted regularly by LFO and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support in BFA .

Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 36 Renewal/Recompetition/Termination Funding for operations and maintenance for the NSF LHC program was renewed in FY 2017 following external review of proposals from ATLAS and CMS. NSF's review process culminated in the implementation of cooperative agreements for operation that will expire in FY 2022. ATLAS and CMS periodically conduct internal competition among the U .S. universities within each collaboration to select the NSF PI and host institution for the Cooperative Agreement for operation. This process preceded the current award s, and it will be repeated prior to submission of the LHC operations proposal in FY 2022. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities 37 LASER INTERFEROMETER GRAVITATIONAL -WAVE $45,000,000 OBSERVATORY FY 2018 Actual includes $10.0 million in additional FY 2018 funding above the requested amount.Las er Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Obs ervatory Funding (Dollars in 2018 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that cataclysmic processes involving extremely dense objects in the universe, such as the collision and merger of two black holes, will produce gravitational radiation. On Sept ember 14, 2015, NSF's LIGO directly observed gravitational radiation from a black -hole merger, verifying this 100 -year-old prediction. This is an achievement of historic importance for fundamental physics, astrophysics, and astronomy, as it opens an entirely new observational window on the universe. This achievement was announced to the world in a series of international press con ferences on February 11, 2016. LIGO announced detection of a second black- hole merger on June 15, 2016. In October 2017, LIGO announced the first detection of a neutron star-neutron star merger , observed on August 17, 2017. This event was also observed in the electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to radio waves, by 70 telescopes around the world. These observations had the far -reaching consequence of confirming that most of the elements heavier than iron were produced by neutron star -neutron star merger s. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Barry Barish, Kip Thorne, and Rainer Weiss for their \"decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.\" In two separate observational periods beginning with the Sept ember 14, 2015 detection, LIGO has now detected gravitational waves from 10 stellar -mass binary black hole mergers as well as the one binary neutron star inspiral. During the first observing peri od, or \"run\" (O1), from September 12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which lasted from November 30, 2016, to August 25, 2017, saw a binary neutron star merger and a total of seven binary black hole mergers. GW170729, the third event detected in O2 on July 29, 2017, is the most massive and distant gravitational wave source ever observed. In this coalescence, which happened approximately five billion years ago, an equivalent energy of almost five solar masses was converted into gravitational radiation. The European Advanced Virgo interferometer joined NSF's two Advanced LIGO detectors on August 1, 2017, in O2. While the LIGO -Virgo three -detector network was operational for only three and a half weeks, five events were observed in this period. One of these, GW170814, was the first binary black hole merger measured by the three- detector network, enabling the first measurements of gravitational wave polarization and providing an additional confirmation of the theory of general relativity . The Virgo interferometer also contributed to the detection of the binary neutron star merger . All these observations were made while LIGO is still in the process of fine- tuning its instrumentation to reach design sensitivity. Advanced LIGO is currently preparing for a third scientific run beginning in 2019, and a fourth beginning in 2021, incrementally increasing its sensitivity to reach the full capabilities of the current suit e of instrumentation. LIGO, the most sensitive gravitational -wave detector ever built, comprises two main facilities, one in Livingston Parish, LA and one in Hanford, WA. At each facility, an L -shaped vacuum chamber, with two Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 38 4-km long arms joined at right angles, houses an optical interferometer. The interferometers are used to measure minute relative changes in the distances between the vertex of the L and mirrors at the ends of the arms that are caused by a passing gravitational wave. A passing gravitat ional wave causes the distance along one arm to lengthen while the other arm shrinks during one half cycle of the wave, and then the first arm shrinks while the other arm lengthens during the second half cycle. The predicted distortion of space caused by a gravitational wave from a likely source is on the order of one part in 10 21, meaning that the expected amplitude of the length change over the four-km length is only about 1/1000th the diameter of a proton. LIGO's four -km length was chosen to make the exp ected signal as large as possible within terrestr ial and financial constraints: longer arms would result in a bigger signal but would entail larger construction costs. Looking for coincident signals from both interferometers increases LIGO's ability to dis criminate between a gravitational wave and local sources of noise. In 2015, LIGO completed installation of the \" Advanced LIGO \" upgrade, funded through the MREFC account . The upgrade enabled the design, fabrication, and installation of an improved apparatus expected to increase LIGO's sensitivity 10 -fold relative to the initial LIGO apparatus (which had operated through 2009) . During O1, the Advanced LIGO interferometers operated at about four times the initial LIGO sensitivity, and at about six times the initial sensitivity during O2. LIGO's O3 goal is an eight -fold increase. Components for a third interferometer, initially intended for installation at Hanford as a further tool to discriminate candidate signal s from random noise, have been set aside in response to a proposed initiative from the Government of India to establish a gravitational wave observatory there. If realized, this third interferometer would greatly enhance LIGO's ability to locate gravitatio nal wave sources on the sky, facilitating follow -up investigations using optical and radio telescopes. The scientific value of o btaining complementary gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from the same source has already been demonstrated in the recent observation of a neutron star -neutron star merger. As the number of observations expands with enhanced sensitivity and localization, this will s ignificantly increase our understanding of supernovae and neutron stars. Such scientific prospects help m otivate the NSF Big Idea ' Windows on the $45.00 $10.0 million in additional FY 2018 funding above the requested amount.1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends in September 2023.Total Obligations for LIGO (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES1 Facility Upgrades: LIGO researchers are planning a series of instrumental upgrades to take place in the coming years. The first of these enhancements, known as Advanced LIGO Plus (or \"A+\"), will increase the volume of space surveyed by Advanced LIGO by a factor between four and seven, depending on the t ype of gravitational wave source. In FY 2018, NSF awarded $10.0 million to LIGO for the A+ enhancement, with an additional $10.47 million expected to be provided in FY 2019. This award is part of an international effort between NSF, the UK Research and Inn ovation (UKRI) and the Australian Research Council (ARC), who jointly support the U.S. -UK-Australian collaboration of researchers spearheading A+. The A+ upgrades are expected to start operating in 2024. LIGO is pursuing an integrated program of periodic scientific operation of the LIGO observatories, interleaved with engineering studies and upgrades that continue to enhance operating performance . The FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 39 operations budget also supports basic infrastructure maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of data obtained from the interferometers, and maintenance of computational resources for data storage and analysis. Operations funding also enables strategic research and development in instrument science that is expected to lead to longer -term enhancements to op erational performance. A small part of the operations budget supports education and public outreach (EPO) activities. The LIGO Science Education Center (LIGO SEC), located on the Livingston Observatory site, hosts 50 hands -on inquiry -based learning exhibi ts and reaches over 15,000 students, teachers and members of the public each year. Its activities benefit from a partnership with Southern University Baton Rouge (SUBR), the San Francisco Exploratorium, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF), and other col laborating educational entities. Trained docents from SUBR assist participants and serve as collegiate- age role models for young visitors. LIGO SEC programs are supported both through LIGO's operations cooperative agreement and through grants to SUBR and B RAF. The LIGO Hanford Observatory also promotes a highly successful program of outreach to K -12 students and the general public in the Washington State Tri -Cities region, reaching approximately 10,000 people each year. In 2018, LIGO Laboratory secured fund ing from Washington State for the conceptual design of a LIGO Hanford STEM Exploration Center to carry out a high-impact, interactive EPO program similar in mission to the LIGO SEC. LIGO Laboratory/Caltech plan s to submit a construction proposal to the Was hington State House of Representatives in 2019. LIGO Laboratory members supported by the operations budget also contribute to many activities of the EPO working group of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. LIGO created a number of connections to industry i n order to achieve the demanding technical performance requirements needed to detect gravitational waves. Innovations across a diverse range of technologies have led to new techniques with broad applications (for example, preparation of stainless steel for ultra-high vacuum application, adaptive laser beam shaping, and precision dielectric optical coatings). Other technological developments at LIGO have resulted in patents and commercial products (in- vacuum electrical connectors, high power electro -optic modulators). The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), an open collaboration that organizes the major international groups doing research supportive of LIGO, has 108 collaborating institutions in 20 countries with nearly 1,300 participating scientists. The L SC plays a major role in many aspects of the LIGO effort. These include establishing priorities for scientific operation, data analysis and validation of scientific results, and contributing to instrumental improvements at the LIGO facilities and exploring future technologies , as well as fostering education and public outreach programs. NSF supports LSC activities in the U nited States at approximately $8 million per year, which is provided through regular disciplinary program funds. Management and Oversigh t LIGO activities are funded through a five- year cooperative agreement that began October 1, 2017. NSF continually assesses the appropriate level of financial support by monitoring actual expenditures contained in quarterly activity -based financial reports from LIGO, and through annual external reviews of operations that examine performance relative to objectives defined in LIGO's annual work plans. Infrastructure refurbishments recently accomplished , such as repairs and improvements to the vacuum system, a s well as further work planned in 2020 will extend the facility life beyond 2030. NSF Structure: NSF oversight is coordinated internally by the LIGO program director in the MPS Division of Physics. The program director consults regularly with representatives from the Large Facilities Office and the NSF Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support in BFA . The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities, also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversi ght. External Structure: LIGO is managed by the California Institute of Technology under a cooperative agreement. A subaward from California Institute of Technology to Massachusetts Institute of Technology supports a team of scientists and engineers that a re fully integrated into all LIGO activities. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 40 The management plan specifies significant involvement by the user community, represented by the LSC, and collaboration with the other major gravitational -wave detector activities in Asia, Europe, and Australia. External review committees organized by NSF help provide oversight through annual reviews. Recent Reviews: Reviews of observatory operation are held annually. Special purpose reviews using external expert panels have also been held as needed, examining to pics such as long -term storage of the interferometer components set aside for possible deployment to India, LIGO computing plans, and LIGO ultra -high vacuum system needs. The most recent annual review was held in June 2018. The next annual review is planned for June 2019. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In 2015 and 2016 MPS conducted a detailed consideration of whether to recompete the management of the LIGO Laboratory in conjunction with the current five - year award . As LIGO had just completed installation of the Advanced LIGO apparatus in early 2015, and its operational activities were focused on initial commissioning of the apparatus , NSF concluded recompetition was inappropriate. The NSB was apprised of this at their August 9 - 10, 2016 meeting , and the award was renewed for the period of October 1, 2018 to S eptember 30, 2023. The 2015 study recommended that NSF, in partnership with the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and with input from the broader astrophysics community, again consider the circumstances and criteria for a possible recompetition midway through the current five -year period (i.e., 2020- 21).

FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 41 THE NATIONAL ECOLOGI CAL OBSERVATORY NETW ORK (NEON) $62,600,000 FY 2018 Actual includes $3.0 million in additional FY 2018 one- time funding above the requested amount.The National Ecological Observatory Network Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 Actual1FY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual The most persistent challenges facing the ecological sciences today are a result of our limited understanding of the complex interactions between living and non- living systems operating over large spatial and temporal scales. Critical global challenges such as ecological effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide land- use change, emerging infectious diseases, and invasive species highlight the complexity of key processes that are connected across large spatial scales and play out over decades. As thes e and other threats arise more frequently and spread rapidly across continents , it is critical to scientific progress that the short - and long- term effects of these phenomena be systematically monitored and assessed , as well as become more predictable through mathematical and statistical modeling . Assessment of ecological processes at a continental scale has been hindered by a lack of infrastructure to enable the research required to address complex ecological issues at the necessary spatial and temporal scales. NEON was designed to address this lack of infrastructure and enable vital research. NEON consists of 81 strategically located field sites, across 20 eco -climatic domains, with instruments, sensors, cameras, and manual biological sampling networked into an integrated research platform for regional - to continental - scale ecological research. The sensor networks, instrumentation, experimental infrastructure, natural history archive facilities, and remote sensing ar e linked via the internet to computational and analytical capabilities to create NEON's integrated infrastructure. NEON was constructed to revolutionize ecological research and engage the research and education communit ies in the use of open data . In doing so, it provides over 170 standardized data products including meteorological, soil, organismal, biogeochemical, freshwater and remote sensing data for ecosystems at various temporal and spatial scales across the United States over a 30 -year timeframe. Using NEON data, scientists across the U.S. are now able to conduct regional - to continental -scale research projects on the fundamental biological processes underlying invasive species, emerging diseases, changing biogeochemical cycles, land-use changes, climatic variation , and biodiversity , as well as other grand challenges in ecological science. Researchers can also arrange to use the Observatory's infrastructure ( field sites, instrumentation, airborne remote sensing, etc.) for their own studies to adv ance understanding of ecological processes. Current Status Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle) is the current awardee for management of NEON. Battelle is a non - profit professional management organization that operates a number of scientific and technic al facilities. Construction of NEON is 99 percent complete and expected to be concluded in mid -FY 2019. NEON is collecting and analyzing bio logical and chemical samples, measuring physical properties, transmitting sensor data to headquarters, and delivering processed datasets and data products via the NEON data portal . Cyberinfrastructure enhancements are underway including some for the data center connectivity and site sensor data processing. Battelle is implementing community engagement plan s that will support overall utilization of the data and resources that are now available to the community. The research community is Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 42 beginning to use NEON data and infrastructure in its research as evidenced by the increase in the number of awards in FY 2018, and the number of presentations at recent Ecological Society of America (31 NEON - related events) and American Geophysical Union (52 NEON -related Design $104.85 - - - - - - - - Operations Maintenance3,464.90 - 62.60 62.60 62.60 62.60 62.60 62.60 Cyberinfrastructure Enhancements - - - - Subtotal, - - Subtotal, MREFC Obligations4,5$447.48 $12.79 - - - - - $80.69 - $62.60 $62.60 $62.60 $62.60 Years2FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES1 1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends in FY 2020. 2 Development and design funding and implementation funding are cumulative of all prior years. 3 Future O&M requests will be based on a more thorough analysis of science capabilities and affordability. 4 In FY 2016, consistent with the revised total project cost, $20.0 million of FY 2016 R&RA appropriated funding was transferred to the MREFC In FY 2017, $5.86 million of FY 2017 R&RA appropriated funding was transferred into the MREFC account. 5 A total of $14.21 million of FY 2017 MREFC funding was carried over into FY 2018. Of this amount, $12.79 million was obligated in FY 2018 to complete project construction requirements. Approximately $1.4 million is being held by NSF to mitigate remaining risks. Cyberinfrastructure Enhancement s: The cyberinfrastructure enhancement s funding will support integration of up-to-date cyberinfrastructure components to strengthen NEON's ability to meet expected data delivery capabilities and user expectations. This will be accomplished through re- engineering and updating some aspects of NEON's data- gathering, processing, and storage infrastructure. C omponents of NEON 's cyberinfrastr ucture , includ e the Grouped Remote Access Peripheral Equipment, the instrumented system s transition pipeline, the data portal and programming interfa ce, and data center security, have been identified for improvement. Enhancements on these components will improve data volume handling, processing capacity and capability, data discoverability and accessibility, and data security. Management and Oversight NSF Structure : The NEON program is managed in BIO, with the Office of the Assistant Director (BIO/OAD) providing policy and programmatic guidance . Oversight resides within the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) and Division of Environmental Biology (DEB). T he NEON Program team within BIO consists of DBI and DEB senior managers, program officers, and a project manager . The Integrated Project Team (IPT) , chaired by the NEON cognizant program officer and which includes representatives from the BFA Large Facilit ies Office (LFO) and the BFA Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, with additional participation from the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs, BFA Division of Institution and Award Support -Cost Analysis and Pre- Award Branch, Office of General Counsel, Office of International Science & Engineering, and the Office of the Director , as necessary, provides guidance and advice in the review and oversight of the project. External Structure In the Spring of 2016, leadership and m anagement of the NEON project was transferred to B attelle , which oversees all aspects of project implementation and coordinates observatory operations. Within Battelle, the observatory director/ chief scientist (OD/CS) provides overall scientific leadership and interfaces with the FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 43 science community and other entitie s to support the scientific priorities and operations of NEON . A Science, Technology, and Education Advisory Committee (STEAC), composed of members of the NEON user community , provides oversight and guidance to the project and helps ensure that NEON will enable frontier research and education. The work of the STEAC is complemented by several Technical Working Groups that advise Battelle on the technical aspects of the project. Reviews A construction close -out review , scheduled for CY 2019, will document the completion of NEON construction scope and transition to operations. External evaluators will be tasked to review project documentation and confirm delivery of observatory ca pacity. Reviews of full operations and maintenance (O&M) are held annually. The first O&M review was held in July 2018, during which external reviewers were charged with the evaluation of details of NEON operations including: data collection, data delivery , community engagement, education and outreach, NEON's biorepository, cyberinfrastructure, cost performance, and risk management. The next review of O&M , emphasizing data availability and quality, is planned for summer of 2019. Progress against the annual program plan and towards implementation of review recommendations is also monitored by BIO via biweekly teleconferences, bimonthly operations reports, and site visits as needed. In addition to these scientific and technical reviews, there are periodic reviews by organizations within BFA . Operations Costs Operations and maintenance support began in FY 2014. In August of 2017, a supplemental operations award was authorized . For planning purposes, costs are held constant by BIO at the projected annual operations ceiling of $65.0 million, pending further evaluation of the time phased cost -proposal submitted by Battelle and identification of further operating efficiencies. Comm unity Engagement Battelle's community engagement efforts are led by the OD/CS. The community engagement programs facilitate increased awareness and understanding of ecological change and familiarize people with large, complex datasets.

Renewal/Recompetition/Termination The current O&M award to Battelle began in November 2017 and ends in October 2020. A n additional 12 months of funding to Battelle was also authorized but is to be awarded at the NSF Director's discretion for FY 2021. NSF is using established large facility processes to evaluate options for subsequent support to ensure continuity of operations beyond the current award. 1 www.youtube.com/neonscience Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 44 NATIONAL HIGH MAGNET IC FIELD LABORATORY (NHMFL) $36,780,000 -$17,38 1 The FY 2018 Actual includes $10.08 million in additional FY 2018 one-time funding above the requested amount and $9.34 million to fund part of FY 2019 costs.National High Magnetic Field Laboratory Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 Actual1FY 2019 (TBD)FY 20 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual NHMFL develops and operates high magnetic field facilities that scientists and engineers use for research in condensed matter and material physics, materials science and engineering, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, neuroscience, energy, and the environment. The laboratory is managed by Florida State University (FSU), and consists of facilities at FSU, the University of Florida (UF), and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). It is the world's premier high magnetic field laboratory with a comprehensive collection of high -performing magnet systems and extensive support services. The facilities are available to all qualified scientists and engineers through a peer -reviewed proposal process. There are approximately 1,700 users per year, including faculty and staff at the three host institutions. Stewardship and oversight of NHMFL is provided through the MPS Division of Materials Research (DMR), a nd the Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT -ICR) facility within NHMFL is overseen by the MPS Division of C hemistry (CHE). The laboratory is an internationally recognized leader in magnet design, development, and construction, including the development of new superconducting materials. Many unique magnet systems have been designed, developed, and built by the Magnet Science and Technology Division of NHMFL. Since 2012, the laboratory has held the world's record for the highest nondestructive, pulsed magnetic field at 100.75 Tesla, a unit of magnetic strength (magnetic flux density ). The 45 Tesla magnet currentl y provides the highest steady -state magnetic fields in the world for user access. T his world record has been held for almost two decades . In April 2017 , NHMFL's new 36 Tesla Series- Connected Hybrid (SCH) magnet reached its performance milestone of no chang e in magnetic field stability and homogeneity greater than one part per million (ppm) across the sampling volume . This stability has enabl ed the world's fi rst nuclear magnetic resonance s pectrum at 1.5 GHz , which opens a window for chemists and biologists to probe greater numbers of elements in the periodic table . Prior to this milestone, the previous record was set at 1.0 GHz. The o ne- year commissioning period for the SCH magnet ended in Fall 2017 and the magnet was added to the user program in January 2018. Both the 45 Tesla and 36 Tesla magnets enable scientists to gain new insights into the electronic structures of novel materials such as graphene, topological insulators, and high temperature superconductors . The 21 T esla FT-ICR spectrometer opened for user operations in October 2015. This instrument is unprecedented in sensitivity and selectivity, capable of analyzing chemical samples of great complexity, such as biological fluids, biofuels, and raw and weathered petroleum. The system impacts a broad ar ray of research areas, such as chemistry, molecular biology, and earth science. A major scientific impact from NHMFL is expected from the research on quantum materials conducted by researchers using the record- setting NHMFL magnets. These magnets allow fo r the exhibition, identification, and visualization of new and unusual quantum effects that lead to deeper understanding of quantum materials and enable the discovery of new ones. Another example of a n area of great potential is new imaging techniques for studying the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging and functional magnetic FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 45 resonance imaging are currently based on imaging proton spin density and intrinsic tissue relaxation rates. With higher magnetic field strengths, NHMFL is investigating other nuclei to use that would result in new insights into mapping the brain and neuroscience. NHMFL collaborates with more than 60 private sector companies as well as a number of national laboratories. These include those supported by the Department of Energy, such as O ak Ridge National Laboratory, which hosts the Spallation Neutron Source, and Argonne National Laboratory, which hosts the Advanced Photon Source. Additionally, NHMFL collaborates internationally. The laboratory delivered and commissioned a 26 Tesla SCH mag net to the Helmholtz -Zentrum Berlin for neutron scattering experiments. Collaborations also exist with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in France, and national magnet laboratories in several other countries, including France, the Nether lands , and Germany. NHMFL provides a unique interdisciplinary and convergent learning environment. The Center for Integrating Research and Learning at NHMFL conducts education and outreach activities, which include a Research Experience for Undergraduates program, summer programs for teachers, a summer camp for middle school girls, and activities to raise the scientific awareness of the general public. 1.73 1.73 Facility Upgrades3 Total -$36.78 $37.83 $38.91 $10.08 million in additional FY 2018 one-time funding above the requested amount.1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only.

The second supplement was provided to address one of the magnet goals recommended by the 2013 report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) on opportunities in high magnetic field res earch1 (see Management and Oversight section ). Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NHMFL is supported by DMR, with the DMR program director as the primary contact for most of the laboratory. CHE s upports the FT -ICR Facility , which is overseen by a CHE program director. The Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) and the Large Facilities Office (LFO) in BFA provide financial and administrative support and t he MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilit ies, also provide high- level guidance, support, and oversight. External Structure: A consortium of FSU, UF, and LANL operates NHMFL under a cooperative agreement. FSU, as the agreement signatory, is responsible for administrative and financial oversight and for ensuring that lab operations are consistent with the cooperative agreement. The principal investigator, the NHMFL director, reports to the FSU Vice President for Research. Four senior faculty members are co -principal investigators. The NHMFL director receives guidance primarily from the www.nap.edu/catalog/18355/high-magnetic -field -science- and-its-application -in-the-united -states Major Multi -User Facilities - 46 NHMFL executive committee, the NHMFL science council, and the NHMFL diversity committee together with recommendations from an external advisory committee and the users' executive committee. NSF initiated a community study through the National Academies on opportunities in high magnetic field research. The resulting report titled High Magnetic Field Science and Its Application in the United States was released in 2013 and presented to the NSB in May 2014. The report continues to inform future plans for investments in this area , including new magnet developments . In 2017, NSF held a workshop, Exploring Quantum Phenomena and Quantum Matter in Ultrahigh Magnetic Fields , to identify the most exciting directions of ultrahigh-field research that could impact the understanding of quantum materials. This workshop was informed by the long -term ultrahigh field magnet development recommendatio ns from the 2013 N ational Academies report . Reviews NSF monitors annual plans and reports including user metrics and conducts monthly teleconferences with the NHMFL director. NSF conducts annual external reviews to assess the user programs, in -house rese arch, long- term plans to contribute significant research developments both nationally and internationally, as well as operations, maintenance, and new facility development. Annual reviews also assess the status of education, training and outreach, operations and management efficiency, and diversity plans. In addition to these yearly scientific reviews, NHMFL undergoes periodic business systems review s by LFO and DACS . Recent and upcoming reviews include: Renewal of NHMFL operations award approved by the NSB, August 2017.

With two linked superconducting cyclotrons, K500 and K1200, it is the leading rare isotope research facility in the U nited States and is a world leader in nuclear physics with the unique capability of producing radioactive beams at energies relevant to nuclear astrophysics. Funding for NSCL also supports the research program of the MSU nuclear science faculty. Scientists at NSCL work at the forefront of rare isotope research. They make and study atomic nuclei that cannot be found on Earth and perform experimental research using beams of unstable isotopes to extend our knowledge of new types of nuclei, many of which are important to understanding stellar processes. Research activities include a broad program in nuclear astrophysics studies, the studies of nuclei far from stability using radioactive ion beams, and studies of the nuclear equation of state. In addition, research is carried out in accelerator physics. NSCL scientists employ a range of tools for conducting advanced research in fundamental nuclear science, nuclear astrophysics, and accelerator physics. Applications of research conducted at NSCL benefit society in numerous areas, including studies on the effects of ionizing radiation on DNA, tests of detectors to be used i n space missions, development of data acquisition systems and software, and homeland security. The K500 was the first cyclotron to use superconducting magnets, and the K1200 is the highest -energy continuous beam accelerator in the world. Through the Couple d Cyclotron Facility (CCF), heavy ions are accelerated by the K500 and then injected into the K1200, enabling the production of rare unstable isotopes at much higher intensities. The laboratory operates an MSU -funded reaccelerator facility (ReA3) that enab les experiments at very low energies\u2014a domain of particular interest to nuclear astrophysics. NSCL is the only facility in the world to provide radioactive beams in this energy regime. Nearly one third of recently proposed experiments will use the ReA3. Th e mix of experiments is determined by proposals for beam use. An external program advisory committee selects the best proposals at a typical success rate of about 50 percent, with constraints on beam availability. The science output of NSCL is driven by th ese experiments, with most running five to fifteen days. Beam physicist Mauricio Portillo in the NSCL beam transfer hall.

In FY 2018 , the operations and maintenance support totaled $18.0 million and research support totaled $6.0 million. The reductions in FY 2020 and FY 2021 reflect the transfer of a portion of the NSCL research support to the MPS Division of Physics' (PHY) core program, Nuclear Physics, as part of the planned transfer of NSCL operations and maintenance to the Department of Energy in 2022. NSCL supports and enhances doctorate -level graduate education and post -doctoral research experiences. About 10 percent of all doctorates granted in nuclear physics in the U nited States are based on research at NSCL. The lab also provides research experiences for undergr aduate students, K -12 students, and K -12 teachers. In a typical year about 800 users conduct research at NSCL; approximately 70 percent of those users are U.S. scientists. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: MSU operates NSCL under a cooperative agreement with NSF. NSF oversight is provided through annual site visits by the cognizant program officer in PHY and other staff, accompanied by external experts. NSF uses the annual site reviews to asse ss the user program, operations, maintenance, facility efficiency, national and international research developments, and in-house research programs. The NSF program officer monitors lab operations and plans through monthly phone conferences with the NSCL director. The program officer consults regularly with the NSF Large Facilities Office and the NSF Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support in BFA . The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities, also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. External Structure: MSU provides add ed support for NSCL, which is managed by a director and three associate directors (ex perimental research, education and outreach, and operations) as well as a chief scientist. The director has the authority to appoint associate directors and designate responsibilities, notifying NSF of changes. NSCL's research program is guided by a program advisory committee of external experts as well as an in -house expert and the chairperson of the NSCL user group. Opportunities for proposal submission occur once a year and the beam hour backlog is no longer than two years. Optimally the laboratory can provide about 5,000 beam hours to the scientific community each year, with actual output depend ing upon facility reliability factors and available funds. Reviews: An in -depth review in FY 2016 looked at results and achievements related to intellectual merit and broader impacts for the prior four years (FY 2012- FY 2015) as well as a review of proposed research, operations, and maintenance funding for the next five years (FY 2017 -FY 2021). The most recent annual review took place in August 2018. The report expressed overwhelming support for the management and operations of NSCL. The next review is planned for Summer 2019.

Credit: NSCL and MSU FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 49 Renewal/Recompetition/Termination NSCL currently operat es under a c ooperative agreement with MSU, which is due to expire at the end of FY 2021. After that time , NSCL will transition to the new Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (F RIB)1, which is being built by the Department of Energy (DOE) on the NSCL site. FRIB is scheduled to become operational in FY 2022 and will use much of the NSCL beamlines , instrumentation, and general infrastructure. NSF anticipates ending support for the operations component of NSCL when CCF operations cease so that FRIB can be integrated into the NSCL beamlines and FRIB becomes operational. MSU will be the performing institution under a cooperative agreement with DOE for the future FRIB. To facilitate interagency planning and coordinate the transition from the NSF -funded NSCL to the DOE -funded FRIB, a Joint Oversight Group of DOE and NSF personnel has been meeting since 20 10. DOE and NSF will coordinate transfer of facility stewardship as it transitions fr om NSCL to FRIB. 1 https://frib.msu.edu/ Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 50 NATURAL HAZARDS ENGI NEERING RESEARCH $11,750,000 INFRASTRUCTURE (NHERI) -47.5% 1 FY Actual includes $11.50 million in additional FY 2018 one-time funding above the requested amount.Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 Actual1FY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual The NHERI program was established in 2015 by NSF as a distributed, multi -user, national research facility for use by the Nation's natural hazards engineering research community. NHERI provide s researchers with access to state- of-the-art facilities and tools , unavai lable through any other agency, to study the performance of civil infrastructure, including buildings, geostructures, and underground structures, in individual natural hazards and in combinations of natural hazards. These facilities provide essential resea rch infrastructure to support two federally- mandated interagency programs: the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. The portfolio of research investigations, which is funded separately through NSF's highly competitive, parallel proposal evaluation process, involves large -scale experimentation linked to numerical modeling, and collection and sharing of data to increase the knowledge gleaned from investment in these facilities. Such research is essential to the development of more comprehensive and more realistic predictive models of how civil infrastructure responds to earthquake s, winds , storm surge s, and tsunami s. These advances, in turn, enable the design of more hazard- resilient civil infrastr ucture and improve safety for citizens during these events. The research infrastructure includes earthquake and wind engineering experimental facilities; a wave testing facility; a post -disaster, rapid -response research facility; cyberinfrastructure; comp utational modeling and simulation tools; and a research data repository. The research infrastructure investment also supports education and community outreach activities. During FY 2015 and FY 2016, NSF established NHERI through eleven cooperative agreeme nts: Network Coordination Office (NCO) at Purdue University, Cyberinfrastructure (CI) at the University of Texas at Austin, Computational Modeling and Simulation Center (SimCenter) at the University of California, Berkeley, Twelve -Fan Wall of Wind at Flor ida International University, Large -Scale, Multi -Directional, Hybrid Simulation Testing Capabilities at Lehigh University, Large Wave Flume and Directional Wave Basin at Oregon State University, Geotechnical Centrifuges at the University of California, Dav is, Large, High -Performance Outdoor Shake Table (LHPOST) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) , Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel, Wind Load and Dynamic Flow Simulators, and Pressure Loading Actuators at the University of Florida, Large, Mobile Dynamic Shakers for Field Testing at the University of Texas at Austin, and Post-Disaster, Rapid -Response Research ( RAPID ) Facility at the University of Washington. The NCO serves as the national and international scientific leader, community focal point, and network - wide coordinator for NHERI governance and community -building activities. Key NCO activities include FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Cong ress Facilities - 51 convening the governance groups; working with the NHE RI PIs to develop consensus -based policies and procedures for NHERI, and the annual NHERI -wide work plan; implementing the facility scheduling protocol to provide user access to the experimental facilities; leading developm ent of a community science plan; running NHERI -wide education and community outreach programs; and building strategic partnerships. NHERI awardees and the natural hazards engineering community work together, through governance and awardee activities, to establish a shared vision for NHERI , set natural hazards engineering research and education agendas and priorities, and make NHERI a highly value- added and productive research infrastructure. The CI awardee serves as the integrator for enabling NHERI to be a virtual organization for the natural hazards engineering community, by providing an array of information, resources, and services, including the definitive NHERI website; data repository (Data Depot); software service delivery platform with computational modeling, simulation, and educat ional tools (Discovery Workspace); collaboration tools; access to high-performance computing resources; and user training and support. The CI awardee also establishes and implements the NHERI -wide cybersecurity plan with all NHERI awardees. The SimCenter develops a portfolio of computational modeling and simulation software and educational modules that reflects a balance of community -prioritized, new capabilities for earthquake, wind, and multi - hazard engineering research and education. The SimCenter's too ls are integrated into the CI awardee's Discovery Workspace. The experimental facilities provide well- maintained and fully- functioning facilities, services, and staffing to enable earthquake engineering, wind engineering, and post -disaster, rapid -response research requiring experimental work and data collection. Data generated by these experimental resources and their users are archived and shared in the publicly accessible NHERI Data Depot. Along with direct operations and maintenance support for NHERI a wardees, NSF provides support for research involving NHERI experimental facilities through separate, ongoing research and education programs.

In its upgraded configuration, the LHPOST will be able to reproduce all six components of motion (two horizontal and one vertical translational components, as well as pitch, roll, and yaw rotational components) experienced by the ground during earthq uakes. In addition, ENG provided an additional $3.0 million to the University of Colorado at Boulder to establish and support a new extreme events reconnaissance research leadership corps that connects researchers from different disciplines, develops best practice guidelines for reconnaissance research, and supports public communications in the event of a major disaster. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 52 Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is handled by two program officer s in ENG/CMMI working cooperatively with staff from ENG ; the Office of Budget, Finance , and Award Management (BFA) ; the Office of General Counsel ; the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs ; and the Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF) in NSF's Of fice of the Director . Within BFA , the Large Facilities Office (LFO) provide s advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. External Structure: Each NHERI awardee is led by a principal investigator (PI), who is responsible for the overall award operations. The NCO awardee coordinates NHERI governance and network activities. Governance is comprised of the following groups: (a) a Council, which consists of the PI of each NHERI award, to provide collective and coordinated leadership f or NHERI as a national facility ; (b) Network Independent Advisory Committee, with diverse representation from the broad scientific and engineering communities served by NHERI, to provide independent external guidance and advice to the Council ; (c) User For um, consisting of representatives from the broad scientific and engineering communities served by NHERI ; and (d) Council -identified committees, comprised of internal awardee staff and/or users, to advise the Council on community priorities and needs for NH ERI. Oversight : NSF provides oversight to NHERI awardees through cooperative agreements. A wardee operations and activities are reviewed through quarterly and annual project reports (for the 11 cooperative agreements) and an annual report for the CONVERGE grant, submitted by awardees and through site visit and reverse site visit reviews conducted by NSF program officers . Studies In FY 2010, NSF supported two studies to assess the need for earthquake engineering experimental and cyberinfrastructure facilities beyond 2014, as described in the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) NSF 10 - 071. 1 One study, a workshop held by the National Research Council on Grand Challenges in Earthquake Engineering Research, was completed in FY 2011, and the second study was completed in FY 2012. These studies provided input to NSF for the determination of suppo rt for future earthquake engineering research infrastructure beyond FY 2014. The plan to support a smaller \"second generation\" Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation ( NEES ) (NEES2) during FY 2015- 2019 was presented to the National Science Board at t heir July 2012 meeting and described in DCL NSF 12 -107. 2 The plan proposed a lower annual operations budget, reflected in the $8.0 million reduction from FY 2014 in NSF's FY 2015 Budget Request, from $20.0 million to $12.0 million, to allow larger investme nt in earthquake engineering research using NHERI facilities. In 2012, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and NSF jointly supported a workshop that led to a roadmap report for measurement science research and development for windstorm and coastal inundation impact reduction, which was published in January 2014.3 In February 2013, NSF released solicitation NSF 13- 537 to compete and operate for FY 2015- 1 http://nsf.gov/pubs/2010/nsf10071/nsf10071.jsp 2 http://nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12107/nsf12107.jsp 3 www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=915541 The above image displays the University of California, San Diego outdoor shake table, which allows large structures to be tested against seismic activity.

Based on the merit review of proposals submitted under NSF 13- 537, NSF made no award. Based on the above studies and report, NSF established the plan for NHERI in FY 2014. This led to the release of solicitations NSF 14 -605 and NSF 15- 598 to establish NHERI through two competitions. Those competitions were completed in FY 2016. A wards for NHERI operations involve commitments for five years, contingent on available funds and satisfactory performance.

Those plans are expected to be announced in spring/summer 2019. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 54 OCEAN OBSERVATORIES INITIATIVE (OOI) over FY 2018 Actual The Ocean Observatories Initiative began in FY 2009 as a MREFC construction project. In FY 2016, OOI transitioned from the MREFC construction effort to the management and operations phase and is now referred to as the OOI Program. OOI is a networked ocean -focused research observatory with arrays of instrumented buoys, profilers, gliders, and autonomous vehicles within different open -ocean and coastal reg ions, as well as a cabled array of instrumented platforms and profilers on or above the seafloor over the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. This networked system of instruments, platforms, and arrays enables researchers to examine complex, interlinked physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes operating throughout the coastal regions and to investigate a spectrum of phenomena and processes including episodic, short -lived events (meteorological, tectonic, volcanic, geological, geophysical, and ecological), and more subtle, long -term changes and emergent phenomena in ocean systems (circulation patterns, climate change, ocean acidity, geophysical events, and ecosystem trends). The OOI facility provides the public, educators, students, and researchers with: (1) OOI long- term time series data sets (raw data and metadata are processed via conventional algorithms and quality control methods); (2) an in -situ ocean laboratory capability to allow OOI users to submit proposals for development and application o f new technologies by connecting their instruments or concepts to the OOI network; and (3) OOI tools that will support undergraduate classroom applications of the OOI, as well as public outreach through informal education. Currently, t he OOI delivers data/ metadata and education tools to the public via the OOI website 1. Since the operations and maintenance phase of the project started in January 2016, the OOI CI system infrastructure has served over 150 million user requests and delivered over 100TB of data to users from over 100 distinct countries across the globe. The overarching scientific themes of the OOI span six multi -disciplinary domains, and each theme incorporates a multitude of research questions. Ocean -Atmosphere Exchange. Quantifying the air -sea exchange of energy and mass, especially during high winds, is critical to providing estimates of energy and gas exchange between the surface and deep ocean, and improving the predictive capability of storm forecasting and climate -change models. Climate V ariability, Ocean Circulation, and Ecosystems . As both a reservoir and distributor of heat and carbon dioxide, the ocean modifies climate, and is also affected by it. Understanding how climate variability will affect ocean circulation, weather patterns, th e ocean's biochemical environment, and marine ecosystems is a compelling driver for multidisciplinary observations. Turbulent Mixing and Biophysical Interactions . Mixing occurs over a broad range of scales and plays a major role in transferring energy, mat erials, and organisms throughout the global ocean. Mixing has a profound influence on primary productivity, plankton community structure, biogeochemical 1 www.oceanobservatories.org FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 55 processes (e.g., carbon sequestration) in the surface and the deep ocean, and the transport of material to the deep ocean. Coastal Ocean Dynamics and Ecosystems. Understanding the spatial and temporal complexity of the coastal ocean is a long -standing challenge. Quantifying the interactions between atmospheric and terrestrial forcing, and coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes is critical to elucidating the role of coastal margins in the global carbon cycle and developing strategies for managing coastal resources. Fluid -Rock Interactions and the Subseafloor Biosphere. The oceanic crust contains the largest aquifer on Earth. Thermal circulation and reactivity of seawater -derived fluids modifies the mineralogy of oceanic crust and sediments, leads to the formation of hydrothermal vents that support unique micro- and macro -biological communities can form economically -important mineral deposits, and concentrates methane to form massive methane gas and methane hydrate reservoirs. The role that transient events (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and slope failures) play in these fluid- rock interac tions and in the dynamics of benthic and sub- seafloor microbial communities remain largely unknown. Plate -Scale, Ocean Geodynamics . Lithospheric movements and interactions at plate boundaries at or beneath the seafloor are responsible for short -term events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. These tectonically active regions are also host to the densest hydrothermal and biological activity in the ocean basins. The degree to which active plate boundaries influence the ocean from a physical , chemical, and biological perspective are largely unexplored. Current Status The OOI Program Team is successfully operating the in -water instrumentation , transmitting ocean data to storage, and incrementally delivering processed datasets and data product s via the website. During FY 2018 the OOI website received over 31 million visits/requests from over 50 countries and approximately 20 T bytes of data were transferred. Annual Work Plan activities for refurbishment and redeployments of the moorings, instruments, and platforms were completed as planned . Data quality management methodology continues to matur e with the transfer of this responsbility to the Marine Implementing Organizations under the new award. It includes active outreach by the OOI science team to the science community on the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) methods and procedures being used.

WHOI has major sub -awardees on the OOI Program Team to operate and maintain the marine infrastructure, manage the scientific data, and operate the cyberinfrastructure. The University of Washington (UW) operates the OOI Cabled Array. Oregon State University (OSU) operates the Coastal Endurance Array. W HOI operates the Pioneer Coastal Array as well as the Global Arrays at the t hree remaining OOI global sites in the Irminger Sea, the North Pacific and the Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 56 Sothern Ocean (the Argentine Basin Array was recovered with out replacement in 2018) , and also serves as the overall Program Management Office (PMO). Management of OOI data is now distributed between UW, OSU and WHOI. Rutgers University manages the cyberinfrastructure and Raytheon Corporation provides project manag ement support, systems engineering, and software services for the OOI cyberinfrastructure. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) in GEO manages OOI operations located within the Integrative Programs Section (IPS) . The oversight , conducted through a coordinated effort between the IPS Section Head and the Ocean Sciences S ection Head, includes the review of observatory metrics and data quality management, as well as integration of the OOI with any new science or infrastr ucture proposals and coordination with the science community. Additional NSF oversight of the OOI Program is provided by the Integrated Project Team whose core members include the Section Head for Integrative Programs and the Section Head for Ocean Science in OCE ; and two members from within BFA from the Cooperative Support Branch and the Large Facilities Office. External Structure: The awardee has a Science Oversight Committee (SOC) which provides input and guidance internally to WHOI for OOI infrastructure planning and management. In FY 2017, nine -member \"Ocean Observatories Initiative Board' (OOIFB) to provide input and guidance to NSF regarding the operation and management of the OOI. The OOIFB is indepe ndent of the SOC and held several meetings during FY 2017 and FY 2018. The OOIFB also established a Subcommitttee focused specifically on the topics of Data Delivery and Cyberinfrastruct ure (DDCI) and developed a timeline for reviewing and assessing the performance of the data deliver y system. Reviews: In December 201 7, NSF conducted a review of the OOI Glider Operations Program component. In June 2018, NSF conducted an in- depth review of the readiness for transition with participation from both the COL OOI Team and the new WHOI OOI Team. In FY 2019, NSF will conduct a focused review o f the DDCI and Community Engagement aspects of the OOI Program. Operations Costs Operations and m anagement in support of scientific research began in FY 2013 with the deployme nt of the first OOI instruments. The associated costs have been and will continue to be supported by OCE . Support for research using observatory data will be through the standard NSF proposal submission process to existing science programs in OCE ; however, because the data are freely available over the internet, researchers around the world have access to the unique data sets OOI is producing regardless of the source of their support. Education and Outreach The OOI website and cyber infrastructure provides an education portal to enable undergraduate level tools for education. The internal OOI SOC actively conducts outreach activities regarding the ocean science datasets to researchers, public, and education users. Renewal/Recompetiti on/Termination A successful NSF merit review of the proposal for the OOI facility took place in 2017 and 2018, and the new five -year OOI Operat ions and Management cooperative agreement with WHOI began on October 1, 2018. In preparation for the next recompe tition in FY 2022, NSF will continue to conduct an annual Program Review and engage with the OOIFB to receive input from the Ocean Sciences community. In addition, NSF will hold a focused mid -award Program Review in 2021 of the performance of the awardee. The information from these activities will be used to determine whether to proceed with renewal or re- competition. The cooperative agreement with COL is operating under a No- Cost Extension through June 30, 2019 to support award closeout activities. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 57 SEISMOLOGICAL FACILIT Y FOR THE ADVANCEMENT $23,160,000 OF GEOSCIENCE (SAGE) $23.16 -$2.29 -9.0%(Dollars in Millions)Seismological Facility for the Advancement of GEosciences Funding FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual The Seismological Facilit y for the Advancement of G Eoscience comprise s a distributed, multi -user, national facility for the development, deployment, and operational support of modern digital seismic instrumentation to serve national goals in basic research and education in the earth sciences, earthquake research, global real -time earthquake monitoring, and nuclear test ban verification. SAGE is managed and operated for NSF by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), a consortium of 125 U.S. universities and non- profit institutions with research and teachi ng programs in seismology, 21 educational affiliates, three U.S. affiliates, and 128 foreign affiliates. SAGE was formed in late FY 2013 from the seismic components of the EarthScope facility and seismic facilities previously managed by IRIS. The FY 20 20 Budget Request will enable SAGE to provide key services for the geoscience research community, including global and regional observing networks, field and technical support for experiments worldwide, data management and distribution systems, and other related activities. $17.89 1 Outyear estimates are for planning purposes only. Total Obligations for SAGE (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES1 The Earth's interior remains a major scientific frontier holding the key to understanding the origin of the planet. Recent developments in seismic sensor design and the acquisition, transmission, and storage of data have resu lted in dramatic improvements in the resolving power of seismic imaging of the interior of the Earth . To serve the research needs of the broad Earth science community, SAGE is organized under three primary service areas: Instrumentation Services The Globa l Seismographic Network (GSN) consists of over 150 permanently -installed broadband digital seismic stations, most of which have real -time data access. GSN stations provide critical data for a range of global Earth science research and support key national security needs such as nuclear test-ban treaty verification and natural hazards warning and response. GSN is operated in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Portable Seismology (PS) includes a pool of over 5,200 portable seismometers that a re made available to the E arth science research community for a wide range of principal investigator -driven experiments largely funded through the NSF merit review process to study a wide range of Earth processes . Polar Support Services supports the develo pment of specialized seismic equipment for use in harsh environments and provides instrumentation, training, and field support for experiments in the polar regions. The Transportable Array (TA) is a continental -scale seismic observatory designed to provide a foundation for multi -scale integrated studies of continental lithosphere and deep Earth structure. After operating 1,700 stations in the lower 48 states between 2004 and 2015, the full 280 -station TA network Major Mult i-User Research Facilities Facilities - 58 is now deployed in Alaska and western Canada. The TA stations collect data for use in studies of natural hazards including earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunami; the plate tectonic process that have formed Alaska; Earth's magnetic field; and Earth's changing climate. NSF is currently working with other Federal agencies on a plan for adoption of stations for long- term operations and maintenance, and any stations that are not adopted will be decommissioned in FY 2020 and FY 2021. The Magnetotelluric component exploits the natural variations in Earth's mag netic and electric fields to provide information on the distribution and composition of fluids in Earth's crust and upper mantle, which gives constraints on Earth's structure that are complementary to those resulting from seismology. Instrumentation Servic es-Coordinated Activities include efforts to develop the next generation of seismic instrumentation for large -scale scientific experiments; global -scale geophysical networks; and training courses to distribute best practices to partners worldwide. Data Se rvices SAGE Data Services (DS) manages an archive of over 500 terabytes of seismic, magnetotelluric, and other data from all SAGE components, the EarthScope program, and numerous affiliated networks; operates automated and manual systems to ensure the qual ity of all data stored in the archive; and provides systems to give the national and international research community timely access to these data. In the last quarter of FY 2018, more than 20,000 unique users downloaded over 134 terabytes of data from the SAGE archive. These data enable the wide range of Earth science studies described above. Education and Public Outreach The SAGE Education and Public Outreach program enables audiences beyond seismologists to access and use seismological data and research, including student internships, and programs for under -resourced educational institutions. Special Emphasis Areas The capabilities that SAGE provides have extensive societal impacts and supplement existing hazard monitoring efforts by US state and federal agencies. SAGE would provide key seismic- related infrastructure support to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The SAGE Global Seismographic Network is co- funded with support from the USGS and enables earthquake and tsunami hazard warning and monitoring by USGS and NOAA while also supporting the International Monitoring System that informs the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization. SAGE instrumentation also aids in USGS volcano hazard studies. The magnetotelluric studies enabled by SAGE, which measure electromagnetic fields in the Earth, are being used to mitigate damage to the US power grid associated with potential space weather events. The SAGE facility is used by researcher s supported by programs in the Division of Earth Sciences and other divisions in the Directorate of Geosciences; including Geophysics, Tectonics , Frontier Research in Earth Sciences, GeoPRISMS, Marine Geology and Geophysics Programs, and the Earth Sciences Program and the Glaciology Program in the Antarctic Sciences Section of OPP . For NSF sponsored research , SAGE supports deployment of portable seismic instruments and use of data managed by DS to solve major Earth science problems. Management and Oversigh t NSF Structure: EAR in GEO , through its Instrumentation & Facilities program, provides general oversight of SAGE to help assure effective performance and administration. The program also facilitates coordination of SAGE programs and projects with other NS F-supported facilities, and with other federal agencies, and evaluates and reviews the performance of IRIS in managing and operating SAGE. In addition, an integrated project team consisting of representatives from EAR, BFA Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support, and BFA Large Facilit ies Office work with cognizant program officer in addressing challenges and identifying potential barriers for success. The EAR Division FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 59 Director and Integrated Activities Section Head p rovide other internal oversight. External Structure: SAGE is managed and operated by IRIS, which is incorporated as a non- profit consortium representing 125 U.S. universities and non -profit organizations with research and teaching programs in seismology. E ach voting member institution of the Consortium appoints a member representative, and these member representatives elect the nine members of the IRIS Board of Directors. The Board members, who serve three- year terms, vet all internal program decisions associated with SAGE management and operation, through consultation with IRIS staff and SAGE advisory committees (one for each major SAGE component and additional ad hoc working groups appointed for special tasks). The Board of Directors appoints a president o f IRIS to a renewable two - year term. The president is responsible for IRIS operations, all of which are managed through the IRIS Corporate Office located in Washington, DC. Reviews: NSF recent ly completed a review of the SAGE facility which found that SAGE was a critical facility for U.S. and international Earth sciences. In FY 2019 EAR will conduct a joint review of the data services activities of SAGE and its geodetic facility counterpart Geodetic Facility for the Advancement of GEoscience (GAGE) . Renewa l/Recompetition/Termination A successful NSF merit review of the proposal for the SAGE facility took place in 2017 and 2018, and funding for the current SAGE cooperative agreement began in FY 2019 and will end in FY 2023. In preparation for the next recompetition that would begin in FY 2022, NSF will be engaging in two activities. First, NSF has requested the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, through the decadal study \" Catalyzing Opportunities for Research in Earth Sciences \" 1, to explore different models to manage geophysical capabilities needed by the Earth Sciences community. Second, NSF will convene an interagency working group to identify the needs other agencies have for the capabilities currently provided by SAGE and GAGE. Th e information from these two activities will be used to draft the solicitation requesting proposals to support geophysical capabilities for EAR funded research and education. 1 www8.nationalacademies.org/pa/projectview.aspx?key=51287 Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 60 FEDERALLY FUNDED RES EARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS (FFRDCS) NATIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH (NCAR) $99,700,000 FY Actual includes $26.64 million in additional FY 2018 one-time funding above the requested amount.National Center for Atmospheric Research Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 Actual1FY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual NCAR is an NSF -sponsored FFRDC serving a broad research community, including atmospheric and geospace scientists and researchers in complementary areas of the environmental sciences and geosciences.

Major Investments in FY 2020 : In FY 2020, investments at NCAR will focus on fundamental research aimed at improving our ability to predict atmospheric, chemical, and space weather hazards, and increasing our understanding of the variability in the Earth's climate system at regional and global scales. In all of these areas, NCAR scientists will work with their university colleagues to further understand the fundamental processes that control the Earth's climate and weather systems. This will include research thrusts in areas such as the role of the chemical composition of the atmosphere, better understanding of the structure and nature of hurricanes and other severe weather events, and the impacts of processes on the surface of the Sun on space weather and we ather on Earth. A continuous process of community prioritization will inform activities undertaken in FY 2020. Aircraft Support : NCAR operates two NSF aircraft: a C -130Q Hercules and a Gulfstream -V (the 'G -V'), both of which are highly modified and equipped with specialized instrumentation, to enable the support of research activities designed to provide new insights into atmospheric chemical processes, the dynamics and coupling of the atmosphere's layers, and interactions between the atmosphere and Earth' s surface. The two aircraft will support community -originated projects deemed by NSF , via separately -managed external peer review , to be of exceptional scientific merit , consistent with the research prioritization mentioned above. Computational Infrastruc : NCAR Wyoming (the NCAR -Wyoming Supercomputing Center), that supports high- end community modeling programs in atmospheric, solar, and other Earth Systems processes and has over 1,700 unique users. These include the Community Earth System Model (CESM) , the Weather Research and Forecasting Models (WRF), and the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), which use mathematical formulas to simulate and better understand the chemical and physical processes that drive Earth's climate and weather system. NCAR leads the development of these community models and supports many thousands of researchers in the U.S. and worldwide - for example in 2018, the cumulative number of registered WRF users exceeded 45,000, and was growing by an average of 4,400 per year. NCAR also maintains extensive data archives, providing access to a vast collection of observational, experimental, and modeling data, together with sophisticated Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 62 analysis and visualization facilities, and training and support for users of all levels.

Operating synergistically with optical, infrared, x- ray, and gravitational wave telescopes, NRAO facilities enable discovery over a remarkably broad range of key problems in modern astrophysics that reach from within our solar system to the most distant galaxies in the universe. Using NRAO observing capabilities and data archives, scientists: carry out precision cosmological measurements; test fundamental physics; probe deep into the earliest, most intense, and optically obscured phases of planet, star, galaxy, and b lack hole formation; reveal the cool gas from which stars form; provide essential tools for studying magnetic fields and high -energy cosmic phenomena; and seek to detect the sources of gravitational waves. As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia, NRAO operates the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico ; the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), with 10 sites throughout the c ontinental U nited States, Hawaii, and the U .S. Virgin Islands; and is also the North American implementing organization for the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). These ground -based observing facilities for radio astronomy are available to any qualified researcher, regardless of af filiation or nationality, on the basis of scientific, merit- reviewed proposals. In addition to conducting NSF-funded astrophysical observations, t he VLBA is used for fundamental support of the International Celestial Reference Frame, under an agreement wit h the United States Naval Observatory (USNO). NRAO facilities annually serve over 2,500 users worldwide; moreover, continued high demand for ALMA has resulted in the most proposals ever received for an astronomical facility in response to a single proposal call. NSF does not provide individual investigator awards targeted specifically for use of NRAO facilities, but many users are supported through NSF or NASA grants to pursue scientific programs that require use of NRAO facilities. Including the ALMA oper ations staff located at NRAO, staff in FY 2020 will consist of 402 full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) in the operations and maintenance components , including : 71 in telescope operations, 47 in science support and research, 39 in development programs, 81 in computing and data management, 73 in administrative services, and 19 in education and public outreach. These numbers exclude staff at the partitioned Green Bank Observatory , managed and operated separately from NRAO , as well as 72 staff in the NRAO co mmon cost pool that serve multiple observatories. In addition, the NRAO managing organization, Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), employs local ALMA operations staff in Chile, currently about 250 FTEs. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 69 In September 2017, Hurricane Maria damaged the VLBA facility on St. Croix, Virgin Islands.

Facility Upgrades : In FY 2018, NSF awarded $3.50 million for repair of tracks at the VLA (supporting critical maintenance) and for the provision of fiber optics for the VLBA, enhancing that facility's data transmission capability. The total FY 2020 NRAO Budget R equest includes ALMA operations ($4 7.26 million ) and non- ALMA operations and maintenance ( $38.40 million ). Included in the non -ALMA funding is $3.43 million for the VLBA which was reintegrated into NRAO beginning October 1, 2018. FY 2018 funding for the VLBA, formerly Long Baseline Observatory (LBO), was provided under a separate cooperative agreement and is shown in the O ther AST Facilities narrative. ALMA is in science operations following the comp letion of construction in 2015. An international partnership between North America, Europe, and East Asia, ALMA provides order s-of-magnitude improvement in observing sensitivity and image quality over previous facilities . Credit: NRAO/AUI. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 70 Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : NRAO supplements NSF Divis ion of Astronomical Sciences (AST ) support with funding provided by other NSF sources, other federal agencies, and non- federal sources. In FY 2018, NRAO received approximately $ 100,000 from non- AST sources at NSF, $1.2 0 million from other federal agencies, and $1.50 million from U.S. universities, foreign scientific and technical institutes, and other non -federal and industrial sources. The development of new telescopes, instrumentation, and sensor techniques is conducted in partnership with relevant industries through competitive sub -awards to various large and small aerospace companies, radio antenna manufacturing firms, and specialized electronics and co mputer hardware and software companies. The LBO received $6.76 million from the USNO while it was part of Other AST Facilities, before it was reintegrated into NRAO at the beginning of FY 2019. For FY 20 19, USNO provided $4.14 million in funding for the VL BA, and plans to provide $4 .19 million for FY 2020. Telescope Operations, $10.99 million : This encompasses support for direct telescope and array operations of the VLA including maintenance, infrastructure upgrades, and telescope management . Development, $7.57 million : The FY 20 20 Budget Request continues to support development programs including next generation electronics and detectors for radio astronomy , as well as planning and the development of technologies for a next -generation centimeter wavelength facility (next generation Very Large Array , or ngVLA) . Science Operations, $6.17 million : This includes telescope time allocation, staff research, science training and education, and science community outreach. Administrative Services, $ 10.49 million : This includes internal common costs used to allocate common and management expenses across the total pool of observatory activity, such as business services, utilities, and other facility costs at the operating locations, observatory management, and the library. Director's O ffice, $ 2.42 million : This supports the director's office and managing organization costs. Education and Public Outreach, $760,000 : NRAO supports a comprehensive outreach program that makes radio astronomy information availabl e to the public .24 With over 150 students involved per year, NRAO facilities are used by graduate students carrying out dissertation research and work experience programs and by undergraduates participating in the Research Experiences fo r Undergraduates program. NRAO also supports a visitor and education center and conducts active educational and public outreach programs. The VLA visitor center attracts over 20,000 public visitors each year. ALMA Operations, $ 47.26 million : In FY 2015, NRAO completed construction of the international ALMA Observatory, funded through the MREFC account. Early operations funding for ALMA began in FY 2005 and ramped up to steady state operations in FY 2018. Operations funding supports a share of observatory operations in Chil e, a technical development program, and the North American ALMA Science Center (NAASC). NRAO created the NAASC in 2006 to provide technical and scientific support for, and easy access by, the broad astronomical community that uses ALMA. The NAASC also organizes summer schools, workshops, and courses in techniques of millimeter and submillimeter astronomy. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: In consultation with community representatives, a n AST program officer carries out continuing oversight and asses sment for NRAO and ALMA by making use of detailed annual program plans, long -range plans, quarterly technical and financial reports, and annual reports. This p rogram officer participates in the international ALMA Board and attends AUI/NRAO governance and advisory 24 https://public.nrao.edu/ FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 71 committee meetings. To address issues as they arise, AST has a dedicated Integrated Project Team (IPT) which includes representatives from other NSF offices, such as the Office of General Counsel, OISE , and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperati ve Support and the Large Facilities Office in BFA . The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities, also provide high-level guidance, support, and oversight. External Structure: Management is through a cooperative agreement with AUI , which m anages the observatory through its own community- based oversight and users committees. The NRAO director reports to the AUI president. Oversight of the international ALMA project is vested in the ALMA Board, which includes a member fr om NSF; coordination and management of the merged international efforts are the responsibility of the Joint ALMA Observatory whose staff includes an ALMA director. An international ALMA review committee advises the ALMA Board. Reviews: NSF conducts annual reviews of the NRAO Program Operating Plan and strategic planning documents, ALMA operations, and the AUI Management Report. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination Following a solicitation issued in FY 2014 (NSF 14- 568), management and operation of NRAO, including ALMA, was competed and the NSB authorized a cooperative agreement with AUI for October 2016 through September 2026. Reintegration of the VLBA operations support into NRAO occurred i n October 2018. Major Multi- User Research Facilities Facilities - 72 NATIONAL SOLAR OBSERVATORY (NSO) $21,140,000 -$9,680,000 / -31.4% Amount Percent $30.82 - 1 The FY 2018 Actual includes $3.50 million in additional FY 2018 one-time funding above the requested amount as well as $8.0 million to forward fund part of the FY 2019 operations costs.National Solar Observatory Funding (Dollars in Millions) FY 20181 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Request FY 20 20 reflects the equilibrium level of the NSO budget commensurate with requirements to operate the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) , the construction of which is scheduled to be complet ed in June 2020. (See the MREFC chapter for more information). The FY 2020 Budget Request fully funds both the DKIST operations requirement (science operations and data center) and the NSO Integrated Synoptic Program (NISP) . As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, NSO is headquartered on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder and provides leadership to the solar community through management of the cons truction of DKIST . When comple ted, DKIST will be the world's most powe rful solar observatory. Life on Earth is critically dependent upon the Sun. S olar phenomena such as space weather (e.g. geomagnetic storms) can significantly impact our increasingly tech nological society. DKIST will investigate the structure and evolution of magnetic structures on the Sun on spatial sca les of tens of kilometers, the fundamental length scales of the processes that drive space weather. With DKIST poised to answer fundamental questions in solar physics by providing transformative improvements over current ground- based facilities, solar research enabled by DKIST will benefit all of humankind . NSO also operates a coordinated worldwide network of six telescopes specifically desi gned to study solar oscillations . NSO routinely provides detailed synoptic solar data used by individual researchers and other government agencies through the NSO Digital Library. NSO data are also made available to the user community via the Virtual Solar Observatory. In 2010, the National A cademies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine ( the National Academies) conducted its sixth decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics. In their report, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics , 1 the National Academies committee recommended that \"NSF - Astronomy should complete its next senior review before the mid -decade independent review that is recommended in this report, so as to determine which, if any, facilities NSF -AST should cease to support in order to release funds for (1) the construction and ongoing operation of new telescopes and instruments and (2) the science analysis needed to capitalize on the results from existing and future facilities.\" In response to this recommendation, the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (A ST) conducted a community- based review of its portfolio. The resulting Portfolio Review Committee (PRC) report, Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges , 2 was released in August 2012 and include d recommendations about all of the major AST telescope facilities. Prior to receiving the PRC report, NSF had instructed NSO to begin divestment of the facilities on Kitt Peak, including the McMath- Pierce Solar Telescope and the Vacuum Tower (no longer in use), thereby accelerating the already -planned divestment by a few years. The PRC endorsed this decision. The PRC 1 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 2 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 73 recommended continued operation of the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) at Sacramento Peak through 2017 and a 50.0 percent reduction in funding of NISP. The status of the transition of NSO -operated facilities is as follows: McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope, Kitt Peak, AZ: NSO ceased operating the McMath -Pierce Solar Telescope as a national user facility at the end of FY 2017. NSF completed a divestment options study of NSO facilities on Kitt Peak and initiated an environmental impact analysis process in FY 2018, consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act . In late FY 2018, NSF made a five -year award to the Kitt Peak National Observatory Visitor Center, part of NSF's National Optical Astronomy Observatory, to repurpose the McMath -Pierce facility as an astronomy outreach and education center. This Windows on the Universe Center for Astronomy Outreach will highlight all of NSF's research facilities related to astronomy and astrophysics. Sacramento Peak Observatory, Sunspot, NM : This facility includes the DST and associated infrastructure including office space, laboratory space, dining facilities, and housing . NSO ceased operating Sacramento Peak Ob servatory as a national user facility at the end of FY 2017. A proposal from New Mexico State University (NMSU) to transition operations of the facility from NSO to an NMSU- led consortium was funded in FY 2016. As discussions on the future of Sacramento Peak continue d with NMSU, in parallel NSF began the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in late 2016. Fully compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act, t he final EIS was published in November 2018. The NSB gave it s approval for the NSF Director (or her designee), at her discretion, to sign the Record of Decision (ROD) selecting Alternative 2: Transition to Partial Operations by Interested Parties with Reduced NSF Funding. Moving forward, a potential plan that would be consistent w ith Alternative 2 involves an NSF -NSO -NMSU partnership to operate the facility in a limited fashion. The ROD was signed in Feb ruary 2019. NSO Integrated Synoptic Program : NISP consists of the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) and the Synoptic Optical Long- term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS). GONG now has a component of its operations funding provided through a five-year (FY 2016-FY 2020) interagency agreement wi th the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This NOAA funding supports the use of GONG and its data products for operati onal space weather forecasting. (Also s ee Partnerships section below). NSO is in the process of relocating the SOLIS facility to the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) on Big Bear Lake, - - $30.82 $21.14 $21.79 $22.46 $3.50 million in additional FY 2018 one-time funding above the requested amount.1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement ends September 2024. 2 Excludes funding for cultural mitigation activities in FY 2018 and FY 2020 as agreed to during the compliance process. The FY 2018 Actual includes $8.0 million to forward fund FY 2019 operations. See the MREFC chapter for more information on DKIST.Total Obligations for NSO (Dollars in Millions) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestESTIMATES1 Facility Upgrades : In FY 2018, NSF awarded $3.50 million for development of DKIST level 2 (advanced) data products, making DKIST data more accessible and usable to the solar research community. Major Multi- User Research Facilities Facilities - 74 Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : The managing organization for NSO is the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) , which comprises 46 U.S. member institutions and four international affiliate members. NSO partners include NOAA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , industrial entities, and universities and institutes that collaborate with NSO on solar instrumentation development. NSF is currently under discussions with New Mexico State University (NMSU) regarding future operations of Sacramento Peak Observatory and New Jersey Institute of Technology on future operations of SOLIS at B BSO . Due to the increasing national and interna tional awareness of the impacts of space weather on critical infrastructure and society in general, the importance of operational space weather forecasting has become apparent to U.S. policy makers. Space weather forecasting requires both accurate models o f the heliospheric environment and precise observational data inputs to those models. NSO's GONG program provides operational data products on a routine basis that are used as inputs to predictive space weather models from the U.S. Air Force and the NOAA S pace Weathe r Prediction Center. NSO is continuing the process of upgrading the GONG facility with $2.50 million of funding provided in FY 2016, with the upgrade expected to be completed in FY 201 9. NSF and NOAA are currently in the fourth year of a five -year interagency agreement whereby NOAA provid es approximately $800,000 per year in funding support for GONG operations. NSO Base Operations, $3.83 million : NSO Base Operations includes the offices at NSO's Boulder, Colorado headquarters and the world- wide NSO Integrated Synoptic Program consisting of the GONG array and the SOLIS telescope. DKIST Operations , $17.01 million : Support for DKIST operations is through the R&RA account , while DKIST construction support is through the MREFC account. (See the MRE FC chapter for more information on construction.) The FY 2020 Budget Request for DKIST Operations represents the equilibrium level for the NSO budget commensurate with requirements to operate DKIST. This profile is funding the development of the DKIST science operations and data center in preparation for full DKIST operations, which is expected to begin in 2020. Education and Public Outreach, $300,000 : NSO supports U.S. education goals by promoting public understanding and support of science and by providing education and training at all levels. NSO introduces undergraduate students to scientific research by providing stimulating environments for basic astronomical research and related technologies through NSF's separately funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. NSO has diverse education programs, including teacher training and curriculum development , and a newly -redesigned web portal.3 Management and Oversight NSF Structure: NSF oversight is handled by a program officer in AST working cooperatively with staff from MPS, BFA, the Office of the General Counsel, and the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs. Within BFA, the Large Facilities Office pr ovides advice to program staff and assists with agency oversight and assurance. Representatives from some the above NSF offices comprise the recently - chartered NSO Integrated Program Team, which meets on a semi -annual basis to discuss outstanding program i ssues. The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF), also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. External Structure: AURA is the managing organization for NSO. The NSO director reports to the president of AURA, who is the principal investigator on the current NSF cooperative agreement. AURA receives management advice from its Solar Observatory Council, composed of members of its scientific and management communities. NSO utilizes a users committee for the purposes of self -evaluation and 3 www.nso.edu FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 75 prioritization. The users committee, composed of scientists with considerable experience with the observatory, reviews for the NSO director all aspects of NSO that affect user experiences. Reviews: NSF conduc ts regular reviews of NSO's Annual Progress Report and Program Plan (APRPP) . The most recent APRPP review was held i n February 2018 with the next schedule d review to occur March 2019. NSF periodically conduct s Business Systems Review s covering both the managing organization, AURA, and the center, NSO. The most recent BSR ended in March 2016, and AURA successfully implemented report recommendations and resolve d outstanding issues. In Q3 FY 2019 a comprehensive midterm review of NSO's long -range plan for the seco nd five years of the cooperative support agreement (CSA) will be conducted. Results of this review will be reported to the NSB. NSO also participate s in reviews of the DKIST project . Recent reviews includ e: an Independent Risk Assessment conducted by the NSF Large Facilities Office (Sept ember -Dec ember 2017) (Nov ember 2017 -June 2018), and an incurred cost audit (Aug ust 2018-present). In addition, a comprehensive external programmatic review and an Earned Value Management (EVM) system surveillance are planned for early Q3 FY 2019. These DKIST related reviews are described in the DKIST narrative in the MREFC chapter. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination In August 2014, the NS B authorized a renewed cooperative agreement with AURA for management and operation of NSO . The renew al award was put into place in June 2015 and will run through September 2024. Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 76 OTHER A STRONOMICAL FACILITI ES $8,420,000 -$3.49 -29.3%Other Astronomical Facilities Funding (Dollars in Millions) 1FY2018 Actual includes both GBO and LBO/VLBA, while the FY 2020 Request only includes GBO funding.Change over FY 2018 Actual FY 20181 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 Request For FY 2020, Other Astronomical F acilities consist s of the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) , which was separated from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) beginning in FY 2017. The Long Baseline Observatory (LBO) , which was separated from NRAO at the same time as GBO and was previously in \"Other Astronomical Facilities ,\" has been reintegrated as the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) into NRAO effective October 1, 2018. The reassignment of that share of the funding request accounts for the significant difference in the requested FY 2020 total. Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI) remains the managing organization for GBO through a c ooperative agreement with NSF. This narrative presents the FY 2020 Budget Request for GBO. GBO provides ground- based radio -wavelength research facilities fo r the U .S. national community, while carrying out a program in education for public visitors and students. The Green Bank Telescop e (GBT ) is the world's largest fully steerable single -dish radio telescope and is GB O's flagship research instrument . The GBO contributes to a broad area of scientific research , including fundamental physics , astronomy , and the search for intelligent life beyond the Earth. GBO is the administrative site of the 13,000- square -mile National Radio Quiet Zone, where all radio transmissions are limited. Having telescopes within th is quiet zone allows for detection of faint scientific signals that would otherwise be drowned out by human -made signals. In 2010, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine conducted their sixth decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics. In their report, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics ,1 the committee recommended that \"NSF -Astronomy should complete its next senior review before the mid -decade independent review that is recommended in this report, so as to determine which, if any, facilities NSF -AST should cease to support in order to release funds for (1) the construction and ongoing operation of new telescopes and instruments and (2) the science analysis needed to capitalize on the results from existing and future facilities.\" In response to this recommendation, the MPS Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) conducted a community- based review of its portfolio. The resulting Portfolio Review Committee report, Advancing Astronomy in the Coming Decade: Opportunities and Challenges ,2 was released in August 2012 and included recommendations about all major AST telescope facilities. In 2012, the Portfolio Review Committee recommended divestment of GBT and VLBA from AST funding because of a less compelling mapping to the science questio ns of the 2010 decadal survey compared to other facilities . As announced in a Dear Colleague Letter, NSF 13 -074,3 NSF partitioned GBT and VLBA from the competition for NRAO management and operations, which increased flexibility for exploring cost - efficient operational models and sustainable partnerships for GBO (comprising GBT and the Green Bank site and facilities) and VLBA/ LBO . Existing partnerships are described below, and additional partner 1 www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12951 2 www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/ast_portfolio_review.jsp 3 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13074/nsf13074.jsp FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Facilities - 77 discussions with governmental and non- governmental entities are ongoing. In FY 2016, AST received a proposal from A UI to continue management and operation of GBO and LBO in FY 2017 and FY 2018, separate from the management and operation of NRAO. Previously, the obligations for GBO and VLBA/ LBO were heavily matrixed and not separable from the overall obligation for NRAO. Hence, GBO and VLBA/ LBO , which were previously included in the NRAO narrative, were first presented as a separate entry in the FY 2017 Budget Request. Through the development of ( primarily) federal government partnerships, NSF was able to decrease its funding commitment to VLBA/LBO operations to a satisfactory level that ensures the future of the facility and enable d the reintegration back into NRAO at the beginning of FY 2019 while maintaining the over all facility top -level funding line. Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act , NSF has conducted a formal environmental review of GBO and developed an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) , which considers the environmental impact of various future alternatives for GBO . The final EIS was published in February 2019, and the process is anticipated to conclude in FY 2019 with a decision on the way forward for GBO, which will be memorialized in a Record of Decision published by $8.42 $8.42 LBO Operations & Maintenance23.49 - - - - - - - Total $11.91 - $8.42 $8.42 $8.42 $8.42 $8.42 $8.42Total Obligations for Other Astronomical Facilities (Dollars in Millions) ESTIMATES1 2 Funding for LBO was reintegrated into NRAO as VLBA effective October 1, 2018.FY 2020 Request 1 Outyear funding estimates are for planning purposes only. The current cooperative agreement for GBO has been extended through September 2019.FY 2019 (TBD)FY 2018 Actual GBO Operations and Maintenance : The FY 20 20 Request of $8.42 million encompasses support for direct telescope operations at GBO, including maintenance, infrastructure upgrades, and telescope management , as well as funds allocated for Educati on and Public Outreach. Partnerships and Other Funding Sources : In FY 2017, GBO received approximately $ 4.3 million from other sources, mostly from non- federal partners. External (non-NSF) contributions represent ed approximately 35 percent of the total operations budget of GBO. Many of the GBO partnerships involve guaranteed allocations of observing time on the GBT. In FY 2016, GBO began a 10- year partnership with Breakthrough Listen and had funding partnerships with West Virginia Universi ty and the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) consortium that are expected to continue through FY 2020. (The NANOGrav funding comes from the NSF award to the NANOGrav Physics Frontier s Center.) In addition, the GBO part nership with the RadioAstron space mission continue d into FY 2019. Other partner ship development efforts are continu ing. Management and Oversight NSF Structure: In consultation with community representatives, a dedicated AST program officer carries out co ntinuing oversight and assessment for GBO by making use of detailed annual program plans, technical and financial reports, and annual reports submitted to NSF. The AST program officer attends AUI governance and advisory committee meetings. To address issues as they arise, AST has a dedicated Integrated Project Team for GBO, which includes representatives from other NSF offices, Major Multi -User Research Facilities Facilities - 78 such as the Office of General Counsel, OISE , and the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support and the Large Facilities Office in BFA . The MPS Facilities team, together with the NSF Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF), also provide high -level guidance, support, and oversight. External Stru cture: Management is through a cooperative agreement with AUI. AUI manages the observatories through its own community- based oversight and users committees. The GBO director report s directly to the AUI Vice President for Radio Astronomy. Reviews: NSF condu cts annual reviews of the Program Operating Plan and reports, including external advice from community representatives. The last annual review took place in June 2018, and the next one is scheduled for April 2019. Renewal/Recompetition/Termination GBO is currently supported through a cooperative agreement, w hich ends on September 30, 2019. NSF expects to receive a proposal from AUI that will help to identify the future structure and operat ional support required for GBO beyond FY 2019.

NSF C-Accel is an entity that will make timely investments that (1) initiate new capabilit ies to accelerate convergence research in areas of nationa l importance , and (2) build capacity in multi -stakeholder convergence teams to address these critical challenges. Focusing on use -inspired, convergence research, with directed deliverables and using an approach that rewards innovation, risk -taking, and transition to use , NSF C-Accel is model ed on acceleration and innovation activities that have proven successful at the most forward- looking universities and companies . NSF C-Accel will align NSF's processes and operations with contemporary science and en gineering research. As the only federal agency that funds foundational research and education across all fields of non - biomedical science and engineering, NSF is uniquely poised to initiate this structural change. NSF also has a unique role with colleges and universities, which are critical participants in this activity, as well as with other stakeholders, such as other federal agencies, industry, non- profits, foundations, and funding agencies around the world. While NSF C -Accel is separate from directorates in leadership, budget, and programmatic approaches, it will be aligned with, build upon, and stimulate new directions for directorates' foundational research investments. These activities will become a standard part of NSF's portfolio of funding mechanisms to accelerate research across a broad range of themes. To build partnerships, NSF C -Accel will use a variety of methods , such as multi -stakeholder roundtables and workshops , to surface grand challenge theme s that are of mutual interest and that could b enefit from acceleration. Individual themes are anticipated to last up to five years with the option to continue another five years, if deemed successful. Each theme will engage a number of multi -stakeholder teams that will work collaboratively to accelerate science and engineering and the transition from research to practice. An initial NSF C -Accel pilot in FY 2019 focus es on two of NSF's research Big Ideas: HDR and FW -HTF. Themes (or tracks) that come from t hese particular research areas have been identified by the cross -agency NSF C -Accel Working Group and align with Administration R&D Priorities, 1 the President's Management Agenda ,2 and the U .S. Five-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan.3 Pilot tracks include, for HDR, advancing data-driven discover y using artificial intelligence ( AI) and machine learning, through early 1 Office of Management and Budget's and Office of Science and Technology Policy's \"FY 2020 Administration Research and Development Budget Priorities\" memo (M -18-22), www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/M -18-22.pdf 2 Office of Management Budget (2018), www.whitehouse .gov/wp -content/uploads/2018/03/The -President%E2%80%99s - Management -Agenda.pdf 3 Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education\" National Science and Technology Council (2018), www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/STEM -Education-Strategic -Plan-2018.pdf . Convergence Accelerator NSF-Wide Investments - 4 prototypes of an open knowledge network . The pilot tracks for FW -HTF include (1) smart job matching, including the development of predictive analytic tools, economic and labor market analyses of future workplace skill requirements, and educational technologies for life- long, adult learning ; and (2) innovative approaches to support the development of workers with the skills required for 21st century work, including data science, predict ive analytics and AI/machine learning techniques. These initial NSF C -Accel tracks are distinguished from the corresponding Big Ideas by the nature of the research, the time scale of the activities supported, and the more hands -on, agile approach to proje ct management and support that is envisioned. Goals 1. Accelerate the progress of use- inspired convergence research. Accelerate scientific discovery and innovation by applying more agile team identification, funding, and project management mechanisms to use -inspired, convergence research that requires the integration of knowledge, skills, and methodologies from multiple disciplines and stakeholders. 2. Harness partnerships to design and enable translational convergence research. Assist academic researchers to engage with non- NSF partners - such as commercial entities, non - profits, foundations, philanthropies, other state or federal agencies, and international funders - to create partnerships that identify high -impact research directions and collaborate to achieve the research goals. 3. Focus cohorts of teams around broad national goals. Support activities that bring together the range of expertise needed to tackle pressing, transdisciplinary research challenges and enable the formation of advanced research teams. Use coopetition mechanisms to enable cohorts of teams to progress towards research goals more rapidly than single teams alone can do. FY 2020 Investments In FY 2020, $60.0 million will support the continuation of the two initial tracks of the NSF C-Accel. This funding will also support new tracks stimulated by research in HDR , FW -HTF , and other Big Ideas, based on mutual interest of the partners and readiness of the research community to respond. New tracks will develop through community workshops, roundtables (e.g., with industry, non- profits, and foundations) and analysis of emerging foundational advances in NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NSF anticipates that external partners will contribute an additional $40 .0 million in FY 2020. For the partners, this is a n ew avenue for R&D, allowing access to academic researchers working at the forefront of knowledge . For the academic researchers, this allows access to partners who are interested in contributing to research projects and the broader themes/tracks.

Each of these goals is designed to amplify the intrinsically multidisciplinary nature of the emerging field of data science. The H DR Big Idea will establish theoretical, technical, and ethical frameworks that will be applied to tackle data -intensive problems in science and engineering, contributing to data -driven decision making that impacts society. Harnessing the Data Revolution NSF-Wide Investments - 6 FY 2020 Stewardship Investments Foundations of Data Science ($6.0 million) HDR will continue to support research in data science and data -enabled science and engineering primarily through the Transdisciplinary Research In Principles Of Data Science (HDR TRIPODS) program. HDR TRIPODS wil l bring together the electrical engineering, mathematics, statistics, and theoretical computer science communities. Through integrated research and training activities, these communities will collaborate to develop the theoretical foundations of data scien ce. Phase I HDR TRIPODS awards will support the development of small , collaborative \"data science i nstitutes .\" Subsequent Phase II awards will enable the most successful of these smaller institutes to expand in scope and impact into a smaller number of lar ger-sized data science i nstitutes. Data -Intensive Research in Science and Engineering ($2 1.0 million) HDR will continue to support the Institutes for D ata-Intensive Research in S cience and E ngineering (DIRSE) . The DIRSE institutes will complement the HDR TRIPODS institutes described above, and will harness diverse data sources and develop new algorithms, methodologies, systems, technologies, and infrastructure for data management and analysis to address critical national problems. These institutes will be developed through a two -phase process involving conceptualization followed by convergence. By creating a portfolio of interrelated institutes, NSF aims to accelerate discovery and innovation in multiple areas of data- intensive science and engineering. Education and Workforce Development ($3.0 million) HDR will continue to support data science education and workforce development through its Data Science Corps program. This program will provide data scientists and data science students with practical experie nces, new skills, and teaching opportunities across multiple learning environments . The program will also strive to promote data literacy and provide basic training in data science to the existing workforce across various communities. Additional FY 2020 I nvestments HDR Track within the NSF ( NSF C -Accel) The NSF C -Accel seeks to transform how the agency supports the most innovative science, reflecting its commitment to be at the cutting -edge, supporting foundational research, while also encouraging rapid advances through partnerships between academic and non -academic stakeholders. Tracks within the NSF C-Accel focus on grand challenge themes that would benefit from acceleration . To fully exploit the progression from data to knowledge to information, the HDR track within the NSF C -Accel will support research and development of an Open Knowledge Network (OKN). The OKN will allow stored data (both structured and unstructured data) to be located, and their attributes and relationship s to other data and to real-world objects and concepts to be understood at a semantic level . A focus of the OKN will be on exploiting publicly available datasets from the U.S. Government and other sources. For more information on the NSF C -Accel, please refer t o the NSF C -Accel narrative in this chapter. Foundational Activities These activities comprise ongoing investments by NSF directorates and offices in programs that laid the initial foundation s for the HDR Big Idea and HDR Track in the C -Accel . These activities will continue to be supported and aligned with the overall HDR strategic goals. The se foundational programs are currently managed by NSF's directorates and offices and will continue to remain within the directorates and offices with respect to their funding and management . NSF-Wide Investments - 7 THE FUTURE OF WORK A T THE HUMAN -TECHNOLO GY FRONTIER (FW -HTF) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 Request Stewardship Activities - - $30.00 Foundational Activities $159.95 - $114.30 CISE 89.89 - - 11.50 Total $159.95 - $144.30FW-HTF Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview The FW-HTF Big Idea supports convergent research to develop new human- technology partnerships leading to increased worker productivity and innovation. This research will prepare the workforce for human -technology partnerships by combining the benefits of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual environments, with increased understanding of value -based social , economic , and educat ional impacts. The landscape of jobs and work is changing with unprecedented speed, driven by the development of new technologies that have moved from the factory floor to an expanding array of knowledge and service occupations. These changes, while promis ing benefits to the Nation in the creation of new industries and occupations, increased productivity, enhanced innovation, and sustained global leadership, come with risks for workers as technology may, in some cases, eliminate entire job classes. The FW-HTF Big Idea , started in FY 2018, is responding to the challenges and opportunities associated with the changing landscape of jobs and work by supporting new convergent research to understand and advance the human -technology partnership, design new technologies to augment human performance, illuminate the emerging socio -technological landscape, and foster lifelong and pervasive learning with technology. Investments in research and development at the human -technology frontier will enable technologies that amplify and augment human capabilities to learn, adapt, make decisions, and make sense of complex patterns and situations. It will be necessary to fund interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer and information science, engineering, social , behavioral, and economic sciences, and education. Increasing human capabilities is the result of the incorporation of advances in AI , data science , and closely related technologies for sensing, actuation, coordination, communication, and control with humans-in-the-loop; and depends upon understanding human communication, thinking, and action. These advances will underpin the creation of systems that are adaptive and human -centered and capable of collaborative interactions with humans. By evaluating the aspects of work that humans do most effectively and the complementary aspects of work that technology can improve, the research will support advances that improve work quality, increase worker productivity, and even make work more meaningful. Additionally, f urther research investments are needed to understand how these changes will affect society and what new approaches to education and training will be required. Moreover, NSF investments will explore the ethical and societal implications of new scientific technologies such as AI and advance the pursuit and adoption of responsible and ethical approaches to using data and furthering data science. These research investments will accelerate progress and enable the Nation's workforce and economy to lead in a futur e that is increasingly and unavoidably driv en by technology and knowledge. The Future of Work at the Human- Technology Frontier NSF-Wide Investments - 8 Goals The FW-HTF Big Idea seeks to maximize benefits and minimize risks of the changing technological environment , to foster support of the workforce in increasing productivity and innovation, and to lay the foundation for new knowledge and developments in science and engineering, through the following four strategic goal s: 1. Understand and build the human- technology partnership. Research on the future of work will identify how new technologies affect jobs , the workplace, organizations, and society, as well as how these technologies can be designed and built to increase national productivity, job opportunities, and worker satisfaction, while enabling worker creativity. 2. Design and de velop new technologies to augment human performance . By augmenting the physical and mental capabilities of humans, new technology can open new job opportunities . Using AI -based, real-time, adaptive physical and cognitive prosthetics can increase opportunit ies for those with disabilities and enhance capabilities in all individuals. 3. Illuminate the emerging socio -technological landscape . As technology becomes increasingly more capable, companies and organizations will be transformed, as will society , the econ omy, and relevant laws. Research will clarify the benefits and risks of such change, and help support human value -based design of new technology and software . 4. Foster lifelong and pervasive learning through technology . Design of training , including novel A I- based approaches, will support both the skill training and reskilling needed to work with new technology and to enable workers to migrate from old jobs to new ones. Adaptive pervasive training systems will depend on new research in cyberlearning systems, as well as the integration of training into task performance and management. FY 2020 Investments FY 2020 activities will leverage the investments made through the FY 2018 and FY 2019 FW -HTF solicitation s that support research on advancing cognitive and physical capabilities in the context of human- technology interactions, the evolving symbiosis of human and artificial intelligence in work, and the understanding and explanation of productivity, innovation, and learning in the workplace. New funding opportunities will be released in FY 2020 that continue to emphasi ze the four FW -HTF strategic goals listed above . FY 2020 catalytic activities include standard grants, workshops, and grants for planning and coordination. These funding opportunities \u2014such as the planning grants and coordination grants \u2014will set the foundation for future integrative activities such as centers- scale institutes and larger -scale grants in FY 2021 and beyond. During FY 2020, FW -HTF will also seek synergies with other Big Ideas and NSF - wide efforts, including GCR , HDR , RI, NSF within NSF Convergence Accelerator (NSF C -Accel ) The NSF C -Accel seeks to transform how the agency supports th e most innovative science, reflecting its commitment to be at the cutting -edge, supporting foundational research, while also encouraging rapid advances through partnerships between academic and non -academic stakeholders. Tracks within the NSF C-Accel focus on grand challenge themes that would benefit from acceleration. The FW-HTF track aims to strengthen the U.S. economy, improve worker performance and job satisfaction, and facilitate life -long learning. Some example projects for the FW -HTF track include efforts to match workers with jobs of the future and to develop living lab oratories, such as in classrooms and manufacturing environments , where hypotheses about learning and productivity will be tested . The actual sub-tracks will be informed by analysis of emerging foundational advances in FW -HTF research and input from stakeholders . The FW - HTF track will align with, build upon, and help reshape directorates' foundational research investments. For more information on NSF C-Accel , please refer to the NSF C -Accel narrative in this chapter. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 9 Foundational Activities These activities comprise continued investments by participating directorates and offices in existing (ongoing) NSF programs that have laid the foundation for the FW -HTF Big Idea and FW -HTF Track in the C-Accel and will continue to be aligned with FW -HTF goals. These foundational programs are currently managed by NSF's directorates and offices and will remain within the directorates and offices with respect to their funding and management. NSF-Wide Investments - 10 NAVIGATING THE NEW ARCTIC (NNA) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 Request Stewardship Activities (GEO) - - $30.00 Foundational Activities $23.67 - $13.00 BIO 1.50 - 1.50 EHR - - 1.25 ENG 2.84 - 2.00 GEO 0.50 - 1.75 SBE 0.38 - 0.50 OISE 1.00 - 1.00 OPP 17.45 - 5.00 Total $23.67 - $43.00NNA Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview Arctic temperatures are warming faster than nearly everywhere else on Earth, with some models predicting that continued warming could produce an ice -free Arctic Ocean by mid -century. The rapid and wide -scale changes occurring in response to this warming portend new opportunities and unprecedented risks to natural systems; social and cultural systems; economic, political and legal systems; and built environments of the Arctic and across the globe. The lack of scientific observations and the prevalence of interdependent social, natural, and built systems in the Arctic make it challenging to predict the region's future. Understanding and adapting to a changing Arctic will require creative new directions for Arctic- specific research, education, workforce development, and leveraging of science, engineering, and technology advances from outside the Arctic. NNA, one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas, embodies the Foundation's forward- looking response to these profound challenges. NNA seeks innovations in Arctic observational networks and fundamental convergence research across the social, natural, environmental, computing and information sciences and engineering that address the intersection of natural, social, and built systems. By drawing upon expert ise from across the agency , NNA investments will accelerate research needed to inform decisions regarding the economy, security, and resilience of the U.S. as an Arctic Nation. On the observing front, NNA will advance and address key gaps in the existing array of observational networks, leveraging resources with the Mid -scale RI Big Idea as appropriate . NNA will also support knowledge co- production with indigenous and local people to enhance observations in key areas. Interagency, state government, and international partnerships will be further developed in order to achieve pan- Arctic and Arctic- global perspectives. NNA will provide support for research activities that advance understanding of the social changes underway, including shifting demographics, changing ways of life, and traditional ecological and other knowledge in danger of being lost. Researchers will also examine economic, cultural, and social impacts on gr oups and communities living in regions impacted by Arctic changes in order to better understand how the social, economic, and governance systems interact with infrastructure such as the delivery of services and access to resources. Findings from this resea rch can help to anticipate social changes that are likely to emerge from increased economic activity. NNA -supported data efforts will enable major advances in modeling and prediction of Arctic systems and their global interactions. Strong coupling of obse rvations, computation, and theory will be supported to FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 11 ensure progress. NNA will leverage investments through the HDR Big Idea by federating data systems supported by NSF and interagency and international partners so that data can be readily discovered, accessed, and interoperated to facilitate more rapid theory and idea development and testing. NNA will build on NSF's STEM investments and the NSF INCLUDES Big Idea to encourage innovative and appropriately evaluated education and public engagement efforts that leverage exciting NNA science and inspire diverse participation in STEM. NSF plans to invest in NNA through FY 2023. Goals 1. Improved understanding of Arctic change and its local and global effects that capitalize on innovative and optimized observ ation infrastructure, advances in understanding of fundamental processes, and new approaches to modeling interactions among the natural environment, built environment, and social systems. 2. New enhanced research communities that are diverse, integrative, and well-positioned to carry out productive research at the intersections of Arctic natural and built environments and social systems. 3. Research outcomes that inform U.S. national security and economic development needs in the Arctic and enable resilient, sustainable Arctic communities. In FY 2017, NSF issued a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) on the GCR Big Idea (NSF17 -065) to explore Convergence approaches within four of the research -focused NSF Big Ideas including NNA. This DCL request ed proposals for Resear ch Coordination Networks (RCNs), workshops, and activities to enhance Arctic observational systems. In FY 2018, NSF issued a DCL on Stimulating Research Related to NNA (NSF18 -048), requesting proposals for workshops, RCNs, and proposals be submitted to the Arctic Sciences program in OPP. NSF awarded 25 new projects under these two DCLs and related opportunities . In FY 2019, NSF issued a solicitation for NNA (NSF19 -511) and plans to make approximately 25 awards to support research grants, and planning grants that develop convergence research teams. FY 2020 Investments NSF's NNA activities in FY 2020 will focus on enabling advances in priority areas , which will be developed by building on outcomes from FY 2017 - FY 2019 activities . In 2019, NNA focused on advances in observing technologies and convergent social/built/natural environment systems science. FY 2020 support for this investment will continue , and NSF expects to issue another solicitation in FY 2020. NSF will also continu e coordination and leveraging of NNA -related activities with external stakeholders, including other federal agencies through the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee chaired by the NSF Director, local residents and indigenous peoples through state and local governance structures of Alaska, as well as with international partners through fora such as the biannual International Arctic Science Ministerial. All of the identified FY 2020 NNA activities will support goals 1, 2, and 3. NSF-Wide Investments - 12 THE QUANTUM LEAP (QL ) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 Request Stewardship (MPS) - - $30.00 Foundational Activities $90.37 - $36.00 BIO - - 1.00 6.83 - ENG 9.60 - 2.00 30.00 OISE - - 1.00 Total $90.37 - $66.00QL Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview The QL Big Idea will build upon and extend our existing knowledge of the quantum world to observe, manipulate, and control, from first principles, the behavior of particles at atomic and subatomic scales. It will enable discoveries in both naturally -occurring and engineered quantum systems and develop next - generation quantum technologies and devices for sensing, information processing, communications, and computing. These advances will unl eash the potential of the Nation's quantum -based scientific enterprise to enhance the Nation's well -being , economy, and security. NSF envisions a platform for the advancement of our fundamental understanding of how quantum phenomena at subatomic scale are manifested at the macroscopic scale. Discovery will lead to new methods of characterization and control, enhance predictive and modeling capabilities, and lead to new computing and networking paradigms. A cross -disciplinary approach combining expertise fr om multiple NSF scientific areas and a strong coupling of experimentation, computation, and theory will facilitate progress. Cross -disciplinary approaches will help identify the knowledge and skills necessary for the responsible conduct of quantum researc h to make fundamental advances in quantum science. Educational research on the learning and teaching of quantum concepts will contribute to the development of the future quantum workforce. QL investments will empower U.S. scientists and engineers to advan ce quantum technologies and understanding , which will in turn lead to the discovery of novel materials, tools, devices, algorithms, simulations, systems, and programming paradigms, as well as new and creative application domains, along with a quantum -capab le workforce. NSF's level of investment in QL is strongly aligned with Administration priorities on Q uantum Information Science (Q IS) and the National Quantum Initiative and will consolidate and expand the U.S.' world- leading position in fundamental quantum research and deliver proof -of-concept devices, applications, tools, or systems with a demonstrable quantum advantage over their classical counterparts. NSF will also broadly engage scientific, engineering, and educational communities, building a human ca pital foundation in pursuit of a better understanding of quantum phenomena. Through a subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council on QIS, NSF coordinates QL activities with other federal agencies and regularly holds meetings to assess and recommend government - wide strategies. Consistent with and crucial to its mission, NSF will seek to form partnerships with other federal agencies, industry, private foundations, national laboratories, and existing centers in order to leverage NSF investmen ts in QL. NSF will seek to increase international cooperation with like -minded partners consistent with the O ffice of Science and Technology Policy National Strategic Overview for the close ly connected area of QIS. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 13 Goals 1. Understand fundamental limitation s in time, distance, and scale for entanglement and coherence of quantum states. 2. Learn from quantum phenomena in naturally -occurring and engineered quantum systems, including emergent behavior, complexity, the quantum -class ical boundary, and theoretical foundations. 3. Galvanize the science and engineering community to enable quantum discoveries, devices, systems, and technologies that surpass classical capabilities. FY 2020 Investments QL activities will focus on enabling advances in selected priority areas, sustaining the NSF QL community, building on outcomes from FY 2018 and FY 2019 activities, and adjusting emphases, as warranted. In FY 2020, a particular focus will be on team effort s to address important challenges in QIS, including but not limited to quantum computing and communications. Funding mechanisms will include targeted solicitations, Dear Colleague Letters, and other existing mechanisms such as Research Advanced by Interdis ciplinary Science and Engineering, E Aarly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research, Industry - University Cooperative Resea rch Centers, and Ideas Labs. NSF also will continue coordination and leveraging of quantum -related activities with external stakeholders, including other federal agencies and the private sector . A Quantum Idea Incubator, prototyped in FY 2018 through the RAISE funding mechanism , was established in FY 2019 through the solicitation \"Enabling Quantum Leap: Quantum Idea Incubator for Transfor (QII -TAQS ) 1\". QII-TAQS established collaborations to develop functional demonstrations of quantum devices, systems, and/or applications , that will continue to receive funding in FY 2020. A Quantum Challenge Institutes s olicitation, \"Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes (QLCI )2\", supporting center -scale quantum activities, was issued in February 2019 and will continue to expand in FY 2020. QLCI research will identify and address science and engineering challenges in addressi ng fundamental at -scale problems in quantum communication, quantum computing , quantum sensing, and quantum simulations. Other QL activities in FY 2020 include increasing support for accelerated quantum materials design, synthesis, characterization, and translation for quantum devices, systems, and networks as part of the FY 2019 solicitation, \"Enabling Quantum Leap: Convergent Accelerated Discovery Foundries for Quantum Materials Science, Engineering, and Information (Q - AMASE -i)3.\" 1 www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf19532 2 www.nsf.gov/publi cations/pub_summ.jsp?org=NSF&ods_key=nsf19559 3 www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505504 NSF-Wide LIFE: PREDICTING PHENOTYPE (URoL) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 Stewardship (BIO) - - $30.00 Foundational Activities $118.18 - $85.00 BIO 35.00 - 30.00 CISE 6.00 - 5.00 ENG 10.03 - 3.00 GEO 4.00 - 4.00 MPS 53.65 - 39.00 SBE 4.50 - 4.00 IA 5.00 - - Total $118.18 - $115.00URoL Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview Imagine a world where we can forecast how life will respond to a changing planet and where we can prevent the emergence of infectious diseases and other dangerous species; a world where a bio -economy uses bioengineered organisms to ensure human and environmental well -being and provides a safe and stable food supply; and a world where genetic and neurodegenerative disease is a thing of the past. Recent advances in understanding and engineering organisms at the fundamental level of the genome place us on the cusp of turning this vision into reality, of re -engineering cells, organisms, and natural systems, and of creating innovative biochemicals and biomaterials that sustain a vibrant bio -economy and strengthen society. Understanding the rules that govern how k ey features of life, such as robustness, resilience, and adaptability, emerge from the interaction of genome, phenotype, and environment, through convergence approaches of all NSF science and engineering will provide a framework for the design of new biolo gical systems from the molecular to ecosystem scale that will enhance human well -being. The NSF Big Idea , URoL, aims to create a new paradigm at the convergence of science, engineering , and technology that will elucidate theoretical frameworks (rules) to enable prediction of the diversity of evolutionary solutions that biological systems use to support life processes seen across the planet. URoL also aims to train the next generation of researchers capable of using those rules/theories not only to predict the behavior of biological systems, but to design biological systems that benefit humankind . NSF released a number of dear colleague letters (DCLs) to announce URoL opportunities for catalytic activities in FY 2018. Building on those catalytic activities , in FY 2019, NSF anticipates funding projects submitted in response to two Foundation- wide URoL solicitations: Understanding the Rules of Life: Synthetic Cell: An Ideas Lab Activity 1 and Understanding the Rules of Life: Epigenetics .2 NSF anticipates URoL will run through FY 2023. Goals 1. To support a convergence of science, engineering, and technology in discovery of rules governing the emergence of robust, resilient, and adaptable phenotypes at three levels of biological organization: (1) 1 www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505600 2 www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505582 FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 15 cells and cell systems; (2) multi -cellular organisms and their co -dependent microbial associations; and (3) complex networks of organisms and species involving social, ecological, and population dynamics. These rule sets are referred to as, respectively, minimal rules, i nteraction rules, and complexity rules . Understanding t he rules at these three different scales should enable the prediction of the behavior of biological systems and how those systems interact with, respond to, and modify the environment , and will facilitate the design of new biological systems at each scale that can serve hu mankind. 2. To support the discovery of scale invariant rules that govern biological systems. These theories should begin to explain the existence of a diversity of solutions that biology creates and uses to solve the essential problems of living systems at all scales: maintenance and transmission of information (genome), capture and conversion of raw materials to make the biochemicals and biomaterials that make up a living system, capture and conversion of energy to support all life processes, and reproduction to perpetuate the species. These universal, scale -invariant rules will serve to help improve human health and safety (e.g., agricultural adaptability, food safety, and environmental sustainability). 3. To support networks of researchers, technology developers , and educators engaged in URoL activities such that a robust community is developed, with an impact that is sustained beyond the five -year investment in the URoL Big Idea. The conve rgence nature of research addressing emergent properties of life stimulates technological innovation that feeds back to drive the science forward. This includes development of: new and improved techniques in molecular, genomic, and cellular examination and manipulation; improved technologies for the captur e, analysis, and interpretation of biological, behavioral, and social phenotypic data in free -living organisms; new sensors and observing capabilities from nano- to macro -spati al and temporal scales; more capable cyberinfrastructure to support robust, data- and computational -enabled URoL discovery and sharing of research results; new approaches for data analysis, such as machine learning; advances in computation and complex modeling to support learning and simulation -driven URoL investigations; and advances in theory coming from all of these sciences and engineering . The predictive goals of URoL also guide investments in training and workforce development to produce scientists that have a firm grounding in t he life sciences as well as the mathematical, physical, computational, behavioral and/or social sciences and engineering that enable them to work collaboratively across disciplinary boundaries. Finally, URoL provides a rich context in which to expand science literacy efforts, in both formal and informal learning environments, aimed at diverse communities across the nation. Research networks provide a mechanism for sustained support of distributed groups of investigators all working to achieve URoL goals. FY 2020 Investments FY 2020 activities will build upon the investments made in FY 2019. New solicitations will be released to support networks of researchers, technology developers and educators (Goal 3) , as well as research to elucidat e interaction rules (Goal 1). In addition, new catalytic activities, including workshops and exploratory grants , will be awarded in FY 2020 to seed investments in convergence approaches to the discovery of scale invariant rules that govern biological systems (Goal 2), which will be fully funded in future years. NSF-Wide Investments - 16 WINDOWS ON THE UNIVERSE (WoU) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 Request Stewardship Activities (MPS) - - $30.00 Foundational Activities $24.66 - $24.50 MPS 24.66 - 22.50 OPP - - 2.00 Total $24.66 - $54.50WoU Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview For millennia, humankind has viewed the universe through the optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum to which human eyes are sensitive. Over the last half century, this range has been extended to observe electromagnetic radiation across the full spectrum from radio waves to X -rays and gamma rays. Observatories constructed and operated over the past two decades have extended this view to include high - energy particles such as neutrin os and cosmic rays. Most recently, with LIGO, NSF has established the ability to view the universe through gravitational waves. This ushers in the era of multi -messenger astrophysics. The three messengers \u2014electromagnetic radiation, high- energy astrophysica l particles, and gravitational waves\u2014each provide unique information. Together, they provide a detailed picture of the Universe that allows scientists to study matter, energy, and the cosmos in fundamentally new ways\u2014 through several powerful and diverse \"w indows\". WoU will build these capabilities and accelerate the synergy and interoperability of the three messengers to realize integrated, multi -messenger astrophysical explorations of the Universe. Prior investments have led to important recent discoveries that demonstrate the power of WoU. The coincident detection of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation identified a merging binary neutron star system, confirmed Einstein's theory of General Relativity, and revealed critical information on the origin of heavy elements. Recent observations of high energy neutrino emission coincident with gamma - ray flares from the nucleus of an active galaxy have revealed for the first time an astrophysical source of high energy cosmic rays. These discoveries, alo ng with others, have heralded the era of multi -messenger astrophysics. WoU is anticipated to be a 10- year effort and builds upon decades of prior investments in individual and large -scale efforts. These include both presently operating observatories such as IceCube (for the detection of high- energy neutrinos) and LIGO (for the detection of gravitational waves) as well as development efforts for future experiments. In the FY 2019 Request, stewardship funding for WoU was first introduced and was complemented by the ongoing investments in foundational activities aimed at building capabilities for each of the three messengers. This funding strategy (stewardship funding supplemented with investments in foundational activities) will continue in FY 2020. These inv estments will also serve to grow the workforce not only for multi -messenger astrophysics but also for engineering, data science, and many other areas. Goals The overarching goal of WoU is to build the capabilities and accelerate the synergy and interope rability of the three messengers to realize integrated, multi -messenger astrophysical explorations of the Universe. There are three focus areas: FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 17 1. Enhancing and accelerating the theoretical, computational, and observational activities within the scientific community : Support efforts within the scientific community to build the observational and analysis capabilities in each of the three window areas, integrate the different research communities to develop full interoperability between the three windows, and develop a new workforce that is skilled in this new paradigm. 2. Building dedicated mid -scale experiments and instrumentation : Construct experiments and instrumentation in the mid -scale project range that will make critical contributions to the multi - messenger research infrastructure by enabling new capabilities in energy range or sky coverage, improved sensitivity, or new computational c apabilities. The Big Idea: Mid -scale Research Infrastructure program, described elsewhere in this chapter, is an essential part of realizing this goal. 3. Exploiting current facilities and developing the next generation of observatories : Enhance infrastructure and provide modest upgrades to enable full utilization of the current generation of multi - messenger facilities, and support planning and development for the next generation of observatories to accelerate progress to realize significantly greater capabilities and extend the scientific reach. FY 2020 Investments WoU is implemented through a new and dedicated program, \"Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi - Messenger Astrophysics (WoU -MMA).\" 1 The WoU -MMA program includes the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Division of Physics within MPS, and OPP within GEO. The WoU -MMA program will address all of the WoU goals. Stew ardship funding ($30.0 million) will reside in the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities but will be allocated to awards from all participating divisions and directorates on the basis of merit and portfolio balance. Participating divisions and offices may elect to supplement this allocation through foundational activities in core research programs in order to advance particularly compelling scientific opportunities related to WoU. For MPS this is expected to be primarily in research grants in astronomy , particle astrophysics, and gravitational physics. OPP will supplement the WoU allocation with grants from the Antarctic Astrophysics and Geospace Sciences Program. 1 PD 18 -5115: www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505593 NSF-Wide Investments - 18 GROWING CONVERGENCE RESEARCH (GCR) FY 2018 ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 Request IA $5.00 - $16.00GCR Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview GCR empowers the U.S. research community to leverage multiple scientific and engineering (S&E) disciplines and develop novel research strategies to address extremely challenging and complex problems . GCR research challenges are inspired by deep scientific questions or pressing societal needs and requir e the integration of multi -disciplinary perspectives. GCR is a n \"enabling \" Idea within NSF's 10 Big Ideas. The grand challenges of today \u2014such as exploring the universe at all scales; developing infrastructure resilient to extreme events and geo -hazards; combining biology, chemistry, engineering , and computer science to produce the machines and materials of the future ; and creating the b reakthroughs that will enable the industries of the future \u2014will not be solved by one discipline alone. They require convergence: the merging of ideas, approaches, tools, and technologies from widely diverse fields of knowledge to stimulate innovation and d iscovery. Key reports describing the importance of convergence for the research ecosystem include Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) reports from 2011 1 and 2016,2 National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine reports from 20143 and 2017,4 and a 2013 report published by Springer.5 These reports emphasized the importance of convergence approaches to S&E research to address grand challenges and underlined the importance of team science to such efforts. These reports also emphasized the role of federal funding agencies in realizing the benefits of convergence, namely, that federal agencies should expand mechanisms for funding convergence research. Convergence research is a means of solving vexing research problems. The unifying characteristi cs of these problems are that: (a) if successfully answered, they are likely to have a large impact, either on fundamental understanding in S&E or on the Nation's ability to meet pressing societal challenges, or both; and (b) they require the integration o f knowledge, tools, and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. Goals The goals of the GCR Big Idea are: 1. Catalyze convergence approaches to compelling scientific and engineering research problems at the intersection of existing disciplines ; and 2. Enhance NSF 's review process to more effectively assess the merit of convergence research proposals. 1 The Third Revolution: The Convergence of the Life Sciences Physical Sciences, and Engineering.

To support convergence research, NSF will enhance its review processes by addressing the key technical, organizational, and logistical challenges that hinder the evaluation of truly integ rative research. GCR's strategic investments in emerging convergence research themes will support the development of new fields of inquiry, discovery of the knowledge necessary for society to develop solutions or technologies to address important societal challenges, and the training of a new generation of convergence researchers. GCR will use several mechanisms to accomplish programmatic goals, including: Capacity -Building Activities : GCR will seek to broaden the range of those engaged in convergence efforts. A portion of the GCR funds will be invested in capacity -building activities, such as workshops, Ideas Labs, and Research Coordination Networks (RCNs). NSF remains open to novel approaches to capacity -building that may be suggested by researchers and other stakeholders. One goal of capacity - building will be to foster new partnerships between U.S. academic researchers and other sectors such as industry, federal laboratories, non- profit research organizations, and the international research community. Another emphasis will be to broaden the demographic diversity of teams participating in convergence research. GCR began in FY 2017 by funding capacity -building activities aimed at addressing grand challenges within NSF's 10 Big Ideas. 6 Exploration Grants : NSF will fund exploratory grants to enable research teams to demonstrate their ability to collaborate effectively; resolve epistemological and ontological differences between disciplines ; begin the process of integrating conceptual models, tools, methodologies, and infrastructure; and show progress on their convergence research projects. Exploratory grants are expected to have budgets of up to $3.60 million and duration s of up to five years. Exploratory grants will prepare research teams for larger scale convergence research awards through programs such as Science and Technology Centers, Engineering Research Centers, and NSF Research Traineeships. NSF announced the first exploratory grant opportunity in FY 2018 7 for awards in FY 20 18 and FY 2019. In Februa ry 2019, GCR released a new solicitation, NSF 19- 551, announcing opportunities for funding in FY 2019 and FY 2020. 8 Enhanced Merit Review Process : An enhanced merit review process will be employed for convergence research projects. NSF will identify a cad re of experienced convergence researchers using data- mining tools, the knowledge of program staff, and suggestions from learned societies. Within this group, NSF will ask a diverse pool of researchers to participate in a College of Reviewers (CoR). The CoR will be a resource that will enable NSF staff to recruit appropriate reviewers for convergence research. FY 2020 Investments GCR funded activities in FY 2020 include: Targeted, capacity -building activities in emerging convergence research themes will emphasize activities that strengthen links between researchers and other stakeholders (up to $1.60 million). Up to four such activities are anticipated. Exploration grant support will continue into FY 2020, giving teams opportunities to explore emerging convergence research challenges and begin integration of tools, techniques, data archives, and knowledge. About 10 to 12 awards are anticipated . Initial funding for these awards is expected to total 6 GCR funded 23 new activities including: a Quantum Science Summer School; a RCN that brings together natural, physical, social, and information scientists, and indigenous scholars to advance the understanding of rapid changes in the Arctic; and a RCN in which early - and mid-career scientists explore one of the most profound and persistent topics in biology , the origins of life. 7 \"Dear Colleague Letter: Growing Convergence Research,\" (NSF 18 -058) www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18058/nsf18058.jsp. This resulted in seven awards in FY 2018. Five to s ix additional awards are anticipated in FY 2019. 8 www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=505637&ods_key=nsf19551 Growing Convergence Research NSF-Wide Investments - 20 approximately $14 million .

For the United States to remain the world leader in STEM innovation and discovery , it must identify and develop talent f rom all sectors to become tomorrow's STEM professionals. Indeed, providing opportunities and support for members of all communities and sectors across the Nation is both necessary for the Nation's economic welfare and NSF's commitment to broadening partici pation. NSF INCLUDES is NSF's response to the Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering's (CEOSE) 2011 -2012 Biennial Report to Congress1 recommending: \"NSF implement a bold new initiative focused on broadening participation of underrepr esented groups in STEM, similar in concept and scale to NSF's centers, that emphasizes institutional transformation and system change; collects and makes accessible longitudinal data; defines clear benchmarks for success; supports the translation, replicat ion, and expansion of successful broadening participation efforts; and provides significant financial support to individuals who represent the very broadening participation that we seek\" (p. v). As part of NSF's continuing response to CEOSE's recommendation, NSF has committed to a plan spanning ten-years, FY 2016 - FY 2025. Specifically, NSF is investing in developing and sustaining the NSF INCLUDES National Network. The overarching goal for NSF INCLUDES is to achieve significant impact at scal e in transforming STEM education and workforce development. To achieve this vision, NSF is funding a suite of projects, including NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots (funded in FY 2016 and FY 2017), NSF INCLUDES Alliances (funded in FY 2018 a nd FY 2019), and an NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub (funding commenced in FY 2018). These activities form the foundation for the NSF INCLUDES National Network. Opportunities to join the NSF INCLUDES National Network have been extended to other NSF -funded pro jects through on- ramps and language in more than 10 EHR and 1 www.nsf.gov/od/oia/activities/ceose/reports/Full_2011 -2012_CEOSE_Report_to_Congress_Final_03-04 -2014.pdf ) NSF INCLUDES NSF-Wide Investments - 22 R&RA program solicitations inviting projects that align with the principles of NSF INCLUDES . Other organizations (e.g., K -12 school districts, colleges and universities, professional organizations , government agencies, foundations, businesses and industries) will also be able to join the NSF INCLUDES National Network and support its goals. NSF INCLUDES Alliances will serve as test beds for designing, implementing, studying, and refining change mode ls that are based on collective impact -style approaches.2 Thus, the NSF INCLUDES investment will provide valuable evaluation knowledge that will strengthen this initiative and contribute to NSF's understanding of strategies for addressing the Nation's most challenging diversity and inclusion issues. Goals NSF INCLUDES investments target the following three strategies: 1. Broadening Participation (BP) in STEM Research: Synthesize and build the research base for broadening participation in STEM and foster the spread and adaptation of proven effective practices. 2. Shared Goals and Objectives: Support stakeholders as they identify shared goals and objectives, including those from specific STEM disciplines. The attainment of shared goals and objectives will be essen tial for success in achieving inclusion in high -quality, STEM learning opportunities, and in the Nation's scientific workforce. 3. NSF INCLUDES National Network: Support local and regional, discipline -specific, and crosscutting, multi- stakeholder partnership s and networks as part of the NSF INCLUDES National Network. The NSF INCLUDES Big Idea rests on principles of collaborative change and the role of networks and organizational partnerships in enabling sustainable and scalable changes in systems and is based on the approach of collective impact and similar models for scaling and growth. 3 Since the program was launched in FY 2016, NSF has funded 70 Design and Development Launch Pilots. In total, the NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilots are engaging 758 partnering organizations in the important work of BP in STEM using innovative collaborative change approaches. BP challenges addressed in the projects include, but are not limited to, providing STEM engagement for students and communities to promote interest in future car eers in STEM, enhancing support systems for undergraduate and graduate students, and expanding access to quality STEM education. Leadership, data collection, expansion, and sustainability are also emphasized. Elements of ten Design and Development Launch Pilots have been incorporated into Alliances that were funded in FY 2018. The progress for the first two years of the program is summarized in the NSF INCLUDES Report to the Nation released in January 2018. 4 A second report on the progress of the program will be published in December 2019. NSF INCLUDES is guided by a detailed theory of change and include s principal investigator interviews and focus groups, NSF stakeholder interviews, technical assistance evaluation, and ongoing portfolio analysis. The first internal Annual Evaluation Report, released in 2018, featured efforts to build and measure collabor ative infrastructure via a shared vision, partnerships and networks, common metrics, and communication needed to produce collaborative change. A Dear Colleague Letter, NSF 17 -111, resulted in 14 E Arly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER s), confe rences, and supplement awards in existing BP programs , thus providing on- ramps to the NSF INCLUDES portfolio. The NSF INCLUDES National Network added five NSF INCLUDES Alliances and one Coordination Hub in FY 2018. The Alliances focus on diversifying gradu ate education programs and STEM faculty , providing research experiences for ru ral first -generation college students, preparing community college students for advanced 2 Kania, J., & Kramer, M .

Additional NSF INCLUDES Alliances will be funded in both FY 2019 and FY 2020, and other funding mechanisms (e.g. supplements, pilot projects, planning grants, and starter networks) will funded, serving as on- ramps to the NSF INCLUDES Alliances and Nati onal Network. FY 2020 Investments In FY 2020, NSF plans to invest $20.0 million in NSF INCLUDES . Goal 1: Broadening Participation in STEM Research NSF INCLUDES will continue to fund BP projects and related research through NSF INCLUDES Alliances and th e existing NSF BP portfolio such as pilot projects, planning grants, and starter networks (e.g., research coordination networks) that serve as on -ramps to the NSF INCLUDES Alliances and the NSF INCLUDES National Network. NSF INCLUDES will support the disse mination and adaptation of proven strategies for expanding the use of innovative and collaborative BP practices in the NSF INCLUDES National Network and NSF's existing BP portfolio. Goal 2: Shared Goals and Objectives NSF will provide ongoing funding to the NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub, which was first funded in FY 2018, to oversee the implementation of a system of measurement, communication, and mutually reinforcing activities across the NSF INCLUDES National Network. NSF will support connections of exi sting NSF BP programs and other NSF -funded projects that support the NSF INCLUDES vision to the NSF INCLUDES National Network using existing funding mechanisms (e.g. , supplements) or other innovative approaches to engage all NSF directorates and offices. NSF will develop a comprehensive evaluation, monitoring, and feedback framework for the NSF INCLUDES National Network, implemented in conjunction with the NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub, which will include indicators and measures for tracking progress towards the achievement of the project goals of the NSF INCLUDES National Network. Goal 3: NSF INCLUDES National Network NSF will fund NSF INCLUDES Alliances, which are five-year, center -scale projects committed to solving a specific set of objectives. NSF INCL UDES Alliances will leverage existing Design and Development Launch Pilots, programs, people, organizations, technologies and institutions to catalyze NSF's BP investments. FY 2020 funding will provide ongoing support to NSF INCLUDES Alliances funded in FY 2018 and FY 2019. NSF will regularly convene principal investigators of NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilots, Alliances, and the Coordination Hub to discuss BP challenges, proposed strategies, scaling mechanisms, and the feasibility of sustaining projects. NSF-Wide Investments - 24 MID -SCALE RESEARCH I NFRASTRUCTURE (MID- SCALE RI) FY 2018 MREFC - - $45.00 R&RA (IA) - - 30.00 Total - - $75.00Mid-scale RI Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview Mid-scale Research Infrastructure (Mid -scale RI) is a n NSF -wide effort to meet the research community's needs for modern research infrastructure to support exciting science and engineering research. Mid-scale RI is an \"enabling\" Big Idea to implement agile mechanisms for funding experimental research capabilities costing bet ween $6.0 million and $70.0 million. The objective is to transform individual scientific and engineering research fields with new infrastructure, while simultaneously training early -career researchers in the development, design, construction, and use of cu tting-edge infrastructure. The scientific importance of mid -scale research infrastructure is reflected in the 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) , which directed NSF to \"evaluate the existing and future needs, across all disciplines su pported by the Foundation, for mid- scale projects.\" Responding to Congress, the National Science Board report, \"Bridging the Gap: Building a Sustained Approach to Mid- scale Research Infrastructure and Cyberinfrastructure at NSF\", 1 highlights that: \"The research community has identified mid -scale research infrastructure as a key enabler of scientific advances on shorter timescales than required for the larger projects funded within the MREFC account. ... Infrastructure investments at the required mid -level can also help maintain the United States' standing among global partners and competitors.\" This graphic shows NSF -wide instrumentation and infrastructure programs. Information presented here focuses on the programs, Mid- scale RI - Track 1 (Mid -scale RI -1) and Mid- scale RI - Track 2 (Mid -scale RI-2) that constitute the Mid- scale RI Big Idea. Information on the complementary Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program may be found in the Integrative Activities (IA) narrative, while information on the MREF C program may be found in the MREFC chapter. Combined, Mid- scale RI -1 and Mid- scale RI-2 support the implementation of research infrastructure at scales that are above what is possible through the MRI program and below what has been funded through the MREF C account. Mid -scale RI Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 25 are distinguished from Mid- scale RI -1 awards by the scale, risks and consequent oversight mechanisms associated with the projects. These two tracks are programs that have a strong scientific heritage within NSF and the com munity. The Mid-scale RI -1 program builds on the knowledge gained through NSF's stewardship of the MRI program. The new Mid- scale RI -2 program, funded through MREFC, builds on NSF's expertise in working with the research community to develop and implement large -scale, complex research infrastructure projects. Both programs will use lessons learned from past and existing infrastructure programs in individual directorates such as Next Generation Networks for Neuroscience in BIO, the Mid- Scale Innovations Program in MPS' Division of Astronomical Sciences, and Materials Innovation Platforms in MPS' Division of Materials Research. Goals 1. Provide access to cutting -edge mid-scale research in frastructure, including instrumenta tion. 2. Enable agile development and implementation of frontier scientific and engineering research infrastructure with a high potential to significantly advance the Nation's research capabilities. 3. Train early -career scientists and engineers in the development and use of advanced research infrastructure that will enable them to make substantive scientific contributions and to envision and realize the larger -scale infrastructure that will transform entire disciplines. FY 2020 Investments The FY 2020 Request for Mid -scale RI is $75.0 million, which is to be split between two separate programs, Mid-scale RI -1 ($30.0 million) scale RI -1 will be funded through the R&RA account, and Mid- scale RI -2 will be funded thr ough the MREFC account. Both programs address all three goals listed above. In fall 2018, NSF issued two Mid-scale RI funding opportunities. O ne solicitation (Mid -scale RI -1, NSF - 19-537) 2 include s an opportunity to propose Mid- scale RI projects with a tot al NSF project cost between $6.0 million and $20.0 million, while a second (Mid -scale RI -2, NSF -19-542)3 includes an opportunity to propose projects with a total NSF cost between $20.0 million and $70.0 million . The resulting awards will be made in FY 2019 and FY 2020. Over the course of the two years, the anticipated number of awards is three to ten for Mid -scale RI -1 and four to six for Mid- scale RI -2. 2 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19537/nsf19537.htm 3 2026 FY (TBD)FY 2020 Request IA - - $6.50NSF 2026 Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview NSF 2026 is dedicated to growing and supporting new activities that set the stage for foundational, breakthrough discoveries and innovations in STEM and STEM education in anticipation of the Nation's 250 th anniversary in 2026. The overall objective of NSF 2026 is t o provide a mechanism for identifying long -term (10 years or more), forward -looking agency initiatives in a systematic fashion and then funding their exploration. It will engage a variety of STEM research and education stakeholders and the general public i n thoughtfully designed exercises to identify challenges requir ing long- term support. It intends to reach beyond single disciplines, directorates, or priority areas and allow for a strategic, agency -level view of science and engineering horizons. NSF 2026 aims to improve NSF's current process for identifying research areas for long -term investment . While program development occurs throughout NSF, it usually happens at the directorate or division level. Moreover, cross -cutting programs are typically develop ed on yearly budget cycles, which may limit vision and scope. NSF 2026, one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas, intends to transcend established scientific structures and go beyond standard operating procedures to ensure continuous exploration at the frontiers of discovery and innovation. NSF 2026 began in FY 2018 with the launch of the first NSF 2026 Idea Machine, 1 which continues into FY 2019. An Idea Machine is a prize competition that invites a broad swath of stakeholders in the science, engineering, and STEM educ ation research enterprise to identify some of the grand challenges for future, long- term investment by NSF, (e.g., to identify the next set of Big Ideas , themes for existing center -scale programs, or other new initiatives ). Specifically, NSF is calling on science, engineering, and STEM education researchers from academia, industry, and non -profit organizations, teachers (who are encourag ed to enter on behalf of their high school classes), and the public, more broadly, to enter the contest. The most promising entries (narratives and videos) will be posted for public comment and judged by panels of STEM experts from multiple stakeholder groups . The winning ideas will: (1) have the potential for significant scientific and societal impact; (2) can generate a great deal of excitement among judges and the public; and (3) be ambitious, original, timely, and beyond the scope of current and planned NSF activities. The winning entries will be aw arded cash prizes and public recogni tion when the competition ends in fall 2019. The name \"NSF 2026\" recognize s and celebrates the Nation's 250th anniversary ; however, NSF anticipate s that the procedures and policies resulting from this effort will contribute to the development of NSF's long-term investment strategies well beyond 2026. If successful, NSF 2026 will identif y STEM research and education initiatives necessary to address the novel scientific and engineering challenges the Nation will face in 2026 and beyond. In addition, the act ivity will surface the best ways of eliciting the most forward - looking ideas and of supporting discoveries and discoverers over the next decade to sustain America's leadership in the science and engineering enterprise. 1 www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/nsf2026ideamachine/index.jsp FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 27 Goals Overarching Goal : By enabling a broad consensus with respect to major initiatives that require and deserve long- term support, NSF 2026 will effectively bolster NSF's global leadership in fundamental science and engineering research and education, enabling discovery and innovation of unprecedented scale and impact. The goals of the NSF 202 6 Big Idea are : 1. Continue to evolve the Foundation's portfolio of major, long- term investment areas by exploring the winning ideas identified by the NSF 2026 Idea Machine. 2. Refine NSF's pro cedures for identifying future (FY 2021 through FY 2030) investments, including using novel and existing mechanisms to engage the broader community, such as the Idea Machine, Ideas Labs, and other forms of prize challenges and crowd sourcing. The frequency of these activities going forward will be informed by the outcome of the pilot run of the Idea Machine in FY 2018 and FY 2019. FY 2020 Investments Specific Investment 1: Preparing the research community to explore the NSF 2026 Idea Machine winning ideas . In FY 2020, a n investment of $5.50 million will support workshops, Research Coordination Networks (RCNs), and EArly -concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGERs), topically focused on the winning ideas identified by the 2018 -2019 Idea Machine competit ion. These catalytic activities will support Goal 1, enabling NSF to refine the winning ideas identified by the Idea Machine . Subsequently, NSF will shape these winning ideas into actionable research themes that can be inserted into existing programs (e.g. , Science and Technology Centers and NSF Research Traineeships) and/or into new, long- term NSF 2026 programs that will launch in FY 2021 and beyond. These activities will bring together researchers from multiple STEM disciplines to form collaborative teams , readying them to respond to the new NSF 2026 funding opportunities and tackle the grand challenges identified therein. Specific Investment 2: Analysis , evaluation , and implementation. An investment of $1.0 million will support the assessment of NSF's long -term research portfolio, the evaluation of the NSF 2026 Idea Machine and other processes that NSF uses to plan and develop its future long- term initiatives, and the incorporation of lessons learned into the design of the NSF 2026 activity. The assessmen t continues the work of tracking the evolving NSF portfolio and identifying gaps and opportunities, a critical exercise that will inform future long -term investment strategies at an agency -wide level. The evaluation will assess the success of the first Idea Machine, inform improvements to its design and execution, and support implementation of additional procedures to identify future investment priorities. Taken together, these activities will advance the Foundation's efforts to craft a flexible, sustainabl e, idea - generating process that can be tailored to meet particular needs and repeated as needed to ensure that NSF stays at the forefront of discovery and innovation.

With world population projected to increase to nine billion (U.S. population reaching 400 million) by 2050 and urban populations expected to double, there are expected to be major increases in demand for FEW resources. NSF support of basic research in the science and engineering disciplines is needed to understand the interdependent and interconnected FEW systems and could lead to an integrated model useful not only for scientific understanding, but also informed decision- making. The INFEWS investment area enables interagency cooperation on pressing sustainability issues facing the Nationunderstanding interactions across the FEW nexus, how it is likely to affect our water resources, and how we can proactively plan for its consequences . Understanding t he food, energy, and water nexus its complex, coupled processes and systems function is a grand research challenge. There is also a critical need for research to enable new technologies that will enhance the productivity of the system and subsystems, minimize overall usage of FEW resources, and define new means for socially and technologically adapting to future variability and demands. Investigations of this complex system will produce discoveries that would not emerge from research on food or energy or water systems alone; research into the interactions among these components and the context(s) of the problem(s) they pose at the FEW nexus will produce new knowledge and technologies. These multifaceted interactions are impacted on the one hand by fundamental laws governing various physical, chemical, and biological processes, and on the other hand by the social, behavioral, and economic decisions made by individuals, organizations, and governments. NSF has invested in discovery research at a disciplinary level, as well as cross- cutting research through programs such as Water, Sustainability and Climate; Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems; Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering and Materials; Cyber Innovation for Sustainability Science and Engineering; Interdisciplinary Research in Hazards and Disasters; and Basic Research to Enable Agricultural Development. Building on prior investments, NSF launched INFEWS in FY 2016 to support fundamental scientific and engineering research for new technologies, design concepts, and development of solutions that address the complexity of the food, energy, and water nexus and its subsystems. The desired endpo int is to improve understanding of the interdependencies of the FEW systems, within a disciplinary and transdisciplinary context. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 29 Under INFEWS, NSF partners with the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA/ NIFA) to combine resources to identify and fund high- impact projects that support their respective missions and foster collaboration between agencies and the investigators they support. In addition, NSF and USDA/NIFA promote international cooperation that links scientists and engineers from a range of disciplines and organizations to solve the significant global challenges at the nexus of FEW systems. NSF plans to end formal investment in INFEWS at the end of FY 2020, and thus will undertake planning and s trategizing exercises internally and in consultation with other federal agencies to determine which aspects of INFEWS should be supported through core programs and which aspects may become part of a different investment area or scientific thrust for the Fo undation beyond FY 2020. Goals 1. Significantly advance our understanding of the food- energy -water system through quantitative and computational modeling, including support for advanced relevant cyberinfrastructure; 2. Develop real -time, cyber -enabled interfaces that improve understanding of the behavior of FEW systems and increase decision support capability; 3. Enable research that will lead to innovative solutions to critical FEW system problems; and 4. Grow the scientific workforce capable of studying and managing the FEW system, through education and other professional development. In FY 2016- 2018, NSF issued solicitations to support research to advance all four goals of INFEWS. Two examples of funded research are: one research project examines approaches to managing food, energy, and water systems under stress in California; another project is conducting an analysis of interventions and the impacts of conservation on reducing household food, energy and water consumption. In FY 2016 -2017, NSF issued Dea r Colleague Letters (DCLs) to support research activities in nitrogen, phosphorus, and water in the context of INFEWS. Research supported by these DCLs is advancing knowledge of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles; the production and use of fertilizers for food production; and the detection, separation, and reclamation/recycling of nitrogen- and phosphorus -containing species in and from complex aqueous environments. One research project team is developing receptors to detect and measure nitrogen/phosphorous to improve accuracy and to inform decisions on fertilizer use and wastewater treatment. This project also provides undergraduate and graduate training and internship opportunities within the agricultural industry. Another project is providing information c ritical to restoring floodplain ecosystems in ways that maximize water quality improvements for nitrogen and phosphorous. In FY 2019, NSF is in the process of reviewing and awarding grants from the FY 2018 solicitation as well as providing continuing support for ongoing projects. A lso, in FY 2019, t he INFEWS working group continue s to coordinate with intra -agency, inter -agency, and international partners to identify and promote additional opportunities to support FEW - related research. FY 2020 Investmen ts In FY 2020, NSF will continue to support ongoing awards made under the final INFEWS solicitation issued in March 2018. This funding will further INFEWS and NSF Strategic Plan objectives by continuing to build interdisciplinary and convergent research and innovation capabilities. O ther activities contributing to INFEWS in FY 2020 will include ENG support for research related to the soil microbiome.

The I-Corps program provides immersive, experiential entrepreneurial education to scientists and engineers by supporting I -Corps Teams and building a National Innovation Network (NIN) that work s cooperatively to build, utilize, and sustain the national innovation ecosystem. NIN support s innovation research and education and enhance s the development of technologies, products, and processes that benefit society. NIN components are diverse in resear ch areas, resources, tools, programs, capabilities, and geographic locations, while the network has the flexibility to grow or reconfigure as needs evolve. These components contribute to enhancing and enlarging the NIN's community of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors. The I -Corps program supports NSF's strategic vision of \"A Nation that is the global leader in research and innovation.\" Specifically, I -Corps contributes directly to strategic objectives in NSF 's 2018- 2022 Strategic Pla n including: objective 1.1, to \"advance knowledge through investments in ideas, people, and infrastructure ;\" objective 2.1, to \"support research and promote partnerships to accelerate innovation and to provide new capabilities to meet pressing societal needs ;\" and objective 2.2, to \"foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation .\" I-Corps stimulates the translation of the results of basic research to societal impact and prepar es the future workforce to contribute to both use -inspired research and the commercialization of ideas enabled by fundamental research. Additionally, Section 601 of t he American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) , signed into law in January 2017, stipulates that NSF shall carry out, further develop, and expand the I -Corps program and other training programs that focus on education in entrepreneurship and commercialization. Goals The specific goals of the I -Corps program are to: 1. Capitalize on NSF's investment in fundamental research; FY 2020 OMB Budget Submission NSF-Wide Priorities - 31 2. Offer academic researchers an opportunity to learn firsthand about technology -based innovation and entrepreneurship, and thereby fulfill the promise of their discoveries; 3. Foster national collaborations of academic researchers with peers conducting research and commercialization, industrial mentors, startup investors, and entrepreneurial education; and 4. Prepare students for real -world experience through curricular enhancements and provide them with opportunities to le arn about and participate in the process of transforming scientific and engineering discoveries to meet societal needs. FY 2020 Investments The I -Corps program c urrently has three components : I-Corps Teams are funded at $50,000 per Team with a duration of one year. NSF current ly funds approximately 240 teams per year. NSF will grow the number of Teams trained through partnerships with other federal agencies and programs, states, and regional organizations, and will continue to identify and fund the best Teams emanating from fundamental , applied, and translational research funded across the Foundation. I-Corps Sites are funded at up to $100,000 per year for two to five years. NSF currently supports 100 active Sites. New I-Corps Nodes are supported for up to five years; funded at up to $1.20 million in year one, declining to $300,000 in year five. Renewing Node s are funded at up to $900,000 in year one declining to $300,000 in year five. NSF currently supports nine Nodes. To build on the I -Corps program 's success and fully realize its potential to help expand the Nation's innovation ecosystem, NSF will scale up the I -Corps program. This scale -up calls for a strategy to provide I-Corps curriculum and experience to a much larger community of techn ology innovators and entrepreneurs who do not have prior connections with NSF and may otherwise not have access to the I - Corps curriculum . The expanded target community will include local and regional entrepreneurs, university spinoffs, and awardees of o ther federal agencies, state governments, and non -profit organizations. By leveraging existing entrepreneurial and innovation capacities in universities and tapping into federal, state, and regional resources, the I -Corps NIN, currently compris ing Nodes a nd Sites, holds significant potential to reach out to a larger number of budding and existing innovators and entrepreneurs. In FY 2018, NSF beg an planning for and experimenting with scaling up the I-Corps program nationwide by growing the network , including increasing the numbers of I -Corps Sites and Nodes . To further increase the pace of scale- up, NSF is developing a new NIN model , in which responsibilities for some I-Corps activities are redistributed . The network is expected to continue to be diverse, inclusive , and flexible . NSF anticipates rolling out this model in FY 2019 and FY 2020 , while continuing to support new Teams and existing Nodes and Sites. NSF will also continue to build NIN partnerships with stakeholders who have access to innovators and entrepreneurs, including federal agencies, state governments, universities, and non- profit organizations.

Seemingly overnight, society has become deeply reliant on the smooth functioning of its digital infrastructure. Unfortunately, attacks on corporations, agencies, national infrastructure , and individ uals have exposed the fragility and vulnerability of this complex cyberspace. Achieving a truly secure cyberspace requires addressing not only challenging scientific and engineering problems involving many components of a system , but also vulnerabilities that arise from human behaviors and choices. Examining the fundamentals of security and privacy as a multidisciplinary subject is the m ost promising approach to develop better ways to design, build, and operate cyber systems; to protect existing and future infrastructure ; and to motivate and educate individuals about cybersecurity. Achieving these goals not only requires expertise in computer science, engineering, statistics, mathematics, social , behavioral , and economic sciences, and education research, but also the translation of new concepts and technologies into practice. SaTC is a multi- year investment area that began in FY 2012 and must evolve continuously to address new threats . Outcomes from SaTC include an organized scientific body of knowledge that informs the theory and practice of cybersecurity and privacy, and an improved understanding of the causes of and mitigations for current threats. SaTC contribute s to the development of foundational countermeasure techniques leveraging sound mathematical and scientific foundations, principled design methodologies, and socio-technical approaches that consider human, social, organizat ional, economic, and technical factors, as well as design metrics for evaluating success or failure of these approaches. In the space of training and education, SaTC make s recommendations for new instructional materials, degree programs, and educational pa thways . Foundational research in SaTC lead s to a research community pursuing a broad and deep multidisciplinary research portfolio spanning cybersecurity and privacy, whose results underlie methods for securing critical infrastructure. Ultimately, through SaTC, NSF expects to produce an innovation ecosystem that ensures (a) new and existing technologies are secure from attack s and (b) users' information is protected from violations of privacy despite new attack surfaces that these technologies may present. Similarly, the creation of a n American workforce and citizenry with an understanding of cybersecurity and privacy issues is one of the benefit s of NSF's support for activities related to the education and training of cybersecurity researchers and professionals. As the goals of SaTC contribute to national security, NSF plans to continue investments in this area for the forseeable future. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 33 Goals 1. Foundational Research: Develop the scientific theory, methodologies, and tools necessary for the development of trustworthy and usably secure systems and appropriate privacy safeguards. 2. Accelerating Transition to Practice: Transition successful fundamental research results and innovations into early adoption and use, and allow NSF cyberinfrastructure to serv e as a premier proving ground and state- of-the-art environment for advancing cybersecurity solutions and moving them into technical and organizational practice. 3. Education and Preparation of Cybersecurity Researchers and Professionals: Increase the number o f qualified American students who pursue degrees in cybersecurity and privacy and enhance the capacity of institutions of higher education to produce professionals in these fields to meet the needs of our increasingly technological society. This goal also includes NSF's investment in the CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which supports cybersecurity education and workforce development. FY 2020 Investments Goal 1: Foundational Research NSF will issue a revised SaTC solicitation for FY 2020 . SaTC will continue to fund innovative projects that advance the science of cybersecurity and privacy, with emphases on : sociotechnical aspects; \"blue sky\" approaches to security and privacy ; artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for cybersecurity; security of AI and machine learning (ML) systems, including adversarial ML; implications of quantum computing for security, including post-quantum cryptography ; and architectures and technologies for protecting cyberspace from the ever -growing smart -and-connected commodity devices . NSF will issue a separate solicitation under the SaTC umbrella in FY 2020 for center -scale efforts that address \" grand challenge \" research areas in cybersecurity and privacy . NSF will build upon existing and develop new partnerships with other federal agencies, industry, and international organizations to more effectively achieve the SaTC program's long- term goals. Towards this end, NSF will support a Research Coordination Network (RCN) that focus es on fostering internati onal collaborations between US -based researchers and their counterparts in other countries. NSF will pursue additional efforts to grow the cybersecurity research community to include more researchers who cross the boundaries between computer and informati on science and engineering , engineering, the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, mathematics, statistics, and education research. For example, NSF may issue a Dear Colleague Letter that will focus on bringing together computer and information scient ists and engineers with social, behavioral, and economic scientists to enable early -stage, socio -technical advances in cybersecurity and privacy . In addition, NSF will hold workshops on a range of cutting -edge topics, including novel applications of blockchain, as well as security and privacy challenges in smart infrastructure, autonomous , and AI -based systems. Goal 2: Accelerating Transition to Practice (TTP) SaTC will continue its focus on TTP research results ready for experimental deployment, early adoption, commercial innovation, and/or implementation in cyberinfrastructure through support of TTP-designated projects.

In FY 2013, the multi -agency Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative was announced, with NSF as one of the lead participating agencies; Congress reaffirmed its support for NSF's continued investments in the BRAIN Initiative as part of the 2017 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (PL 114- 329). 1 Through several cross- cutting programs and numer ous existing core programs, NSF will continue to support catalytic innova tion and the establishment of a national research infrastructure that will accelerate understanding of brain function. There remains much to discover to attain a comprehensive under standing of the general principles underlying how cognition and behavior relate to the brain's structural organization and dynamic activities; how brain, behavior, and environment interact; and how the brain can recover from lost functionality. The critica l challenge to this comprehensive understanding is to integrate research and innovation across multiple scales of space and time, from biophysical, molecular, physiological, and genetic to cognitive and behavioral, with the ultimate goals of establishing i ntegrative, quantitative, computational, and predictive theories of brain structure, activity, and function. NSF is uniquely positioned to address this challenge and continue advancing research on understanding the brain by bringing together a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines to reveal the fundamental principles underlying brain structure , activity , and function. Since FY 2014, the UtB activity has consolidated NSF's ongoing activities in cognitive science, neuroscience, and the BRAIN I nitiative. UtB will continue to run through FY 2020. NSF has been instrumental in supporting transformative breakthroughs in brain research and related technologies, such as optogenetics, the CLARITY brain preservation technique, and the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved artificial retina, which all began with NSF support. The convergence of NSF's disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields is expected to foster new transdisciplinary and convergence approaches to transform understanding of brain, cognition, behavior, and education appr oaches, through the development of new theories and technologies. Goals The overall goal of UtB is to enable scientific understanding of the full complexity and function of the brain in action and in context. This multi -year goal is being pursued across four ongoing priority areas: 1 www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3084/text Understanding the Brain NSF-Wide Investments - 36 1. Develop innovative neurotechnologies, new physical and conceptual tools, experimental approaches, theories, and models to monitor and analyze brain activity and integrate neuroscience information across scales and scientific di sciplines ; 2. Identify the fundamental relationships among neural architecture, activity, cognition, and behavior ; 3. Transform understanding of how the brain responds and adapts to changing environments ; and 4. Train a new generation of scientists, engineers, and educators for a transdisciplinary, globally - competitive workforce in neuroscience and neuroengineering. FY 2020 Investments In FY 2020, NSF 's total investment in the UtB activity is $ 123.36 million. Within this amount, $64.62 million will support activities related to the BRAIN Initiative. NSF will maintain the UtB focus by continuing to employ investment strategies designed to enable the transformational research, engineering, infrastructure (including cyberinfrastructure) dev elopment, and training required to accomplish the multi - year overall goal s specified above. Using dedicated solicitations and existing mechanisms including, workshops, dear colleague letters (DCLs), Resear ch Coordination Networks for Exploratory Research (EAGERs), Ideas Labs, and supplements to existing awards, NSF will continue to bring together the diverse relevant scientific communities in biology ; chemistry ; behavior and cognition; computer, computational , and information science; education ; engineering ; physics ; psychology; mathematics; and statistics to identify scientific priorities and needed research infrastructure (including cyberinfrastructure) , to establish cross -disciplinary standards, integrate da ta and methods, and catalyze the development of conceptual and theoretical frameworks. As part of the BRAIN Initiative, NSF will continue to run three specialized programs: (1) the Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience agency [both NSF and National Institutes of Health ( NIH) ], multinational program that funds projects with the goal of providing a powerful modality for larger -scale interaction and collaborative discovery; ( 2) the Integrativ e Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF -NCS) program that supports research and innovation to enable large -scale aggregation, sharing, and open science driven by integrative neural and cognitive discovery; and ( 3) the Next Generati on Networks for (NeuroNex) program that supports \"Neurotechnology Hubs\" and \"Theory Teams\" to develop and disseminate the newest technologies and theories to neuroscience researchers most able to capitalize on them for advancing understanding of brain function. Through these three programs and numerous other disciplinary and special programs across the directorates, NSF is implementing a phased approach for establishing a national research infrastructure for neuroscience as described in NSF's D CL \"National Brain Observatory: A Phased Approach for Developing a National Research Infrastructure for Neuroscience\" ( NSF 16 -047). 2 While the NeuroNex program is focused primarily on priority areas 1 and 4 above, the CRCNS and NSF -NCS programs focus prima rily on priority areas 2, 3 and 4. NSF is promoting work in educational neuroscience through the NSF-NCS program, noting that advances in neural systems can have significant implications for research on education , consistent with priority areas 2 and 3. Early outcomes of NSF -supported efforts include new international partners for NeuroNex in FY 2020 and a special issue of the journal Neuron highlighting the importance of neuro- ethics for neuroscience research, the first written from a global scale.3 The NSF-wide UtB Coordinating Group will continue to facilitate this cross -foundational activity with a particular focus on leveraging future investments with past investments made not only by NSF, but also by other agencies and foreign countries. The UtB Coordinating Group will also oversee the progress on scientific and programmatic activities to ensure that expected outcomes are being accomplished. 2 www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16047/nsf16047.jsp 3 www.internationalbraininitiative.org/news/neuron -special -issue -neuroethics NSF-Wide -$5,990,000 / CISE - - 2.00 EHR 90.97 - 78.30 ENG 0.05 - 4.75 GEO 5.82 - 5.70 OPP 0.05 - 0.48 Total $99.12 - $93.13IUSE Funding (Dollars in Millions) Overview High -quality undergraduate STEM education is essential for preparing a diverse professional STEM workforce that can sustain U.S. leadership in STEM innovation. 1,2 IUSE is an NSF -wide activity that works toward the goal of ensuring that every college student in the U.S. has exceptional STEM learning opportunities. To this end, IUSE supports research and development to improve undergraduate STEM education from individual STEM classrooms to nation -wide efforts . IUSE also supports innovations in undergraduate STEM education in emerging areas, such as those needed to produce a STEM workforce that can use innovative interdisciplinary approaches , massive data sets, and/or computation to identify and solve problems. All IUSE projects include research and assessment components, thus also contribut ing new knowledge about what works in undergraduate STEM education and why. STEM undergraduate education is essential to meet the demand for STEM professionals in the U.S. workforce. Currently, STEM -related occupations represent about six percent of total U.S. employment 3 and the demand for workers in STEM -related occupations is expected to continue to grow at higher than average rates. The average wage of STEM occupations is nearly double that of non -STEM occupations.4 In addition to educating STEM worke rs, high -quality undergraduate STEM education is essential for producing STEM -knowledgeable workers who can use STEM skills in business and industry, as well as a STEM - literate public that understands and benefits from the progress of STEM .5 Reflecting the breadth of STEM, IUSE is one of NSF's most flexible funding programs , capable of supporting projects relevant to any NSF directorate .

Today, emerging fields of S&E increasingly demand collaborations that span institutions, disciplines, and national boundarie s, and require the use of sophisticated data infrastructure, instruments, and networks of researchers. Computationally intensive and data-enabled science is dramatically changing the knowledge and experience required of researchers and other STEM professio nals across all fields. Thus, the preparation of graduate students in STEM must continue to evolve to provide a supply of scientists and engineers who not only meet the needs of the STEM enterprise, but who also have the knowledge, skills, and preparation to advance it and lead innovation in academia and the private and public sectors. Investing in discoverers\u2014 that is, building a diverse and talented next -generation of STEM research leaders and professionals across sectors through inclusive processes\u2014 is an important NSF focus. A major portion of NSF's overall investment in graduate education and graduate students supports research assistants funded through research grants. NSF also supports graduate students through other mechanisms such as fellowships and traineeships. Goal The goal of NSF's investments in STEM graduate education and STEM graduate students is to prepare a diverse workforce with advanced research training that is equipped to transform the frontiers of S&E and to prepare professionals to pa rticipate and innovate in STEM intensive careers. This goal is based on the following framework 1 to: Advance Science and Engineering Research: Support graduate students and graduate education to enable long- term contributions of new knowledge at the fronti ers of science and engineering. Broaden Participation to Promote Excellence in Research and Build the Next Generation STEM Workforce : Recruit graduate students from a variety of geographic, demographic, social, and educational backgrounds to promote the a dvancement of science and a highly qualified professional workforce. Build Effective Models of Graduate Education and Workforce Development: Support the development and use of innovative models and evidence -based approaches in graduate education, including education and research about promising practices and program effectiveness. FY 2020 Investments NSF's two major agency -wide programs in graduate education are the Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) and the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program. EHR leads administration for both programs. NSF -wide working groups guide the management of these programs.

GR FP has identified and supported outstanding STEM researchers since 1952. The NRT program focuses on developing researchers in high priority interdisciplinary research areas. Both programs provide professional development opportunities for graduate students , including internships and international research experiences. Ongoing evaluation and monitoring of the programs and students involved in GRFP and NRT provide rich data that will be used for gaining a better understanding of graduate program experiences and interventions, monitoring career outcomes longitudinally, and contributing to improving the understanding of STEM professional workforce development. There are several other programs at NSF that focus on developing sectors of the STEM workforce and provide support to students in testing new models and approaches to graduate education. For example, the CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, led by EHR, addresses the national need for a cybersecurity workforce. The Robert Noyce Teacher Schola rship program (Noyce) provides fellowship support to members of the master teacher cohort at the graduate level and funds innovation and development in STEM teacher education approaches. The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation's Bridge to the Doctorate (LSAMP -BD) track and NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S -STEM) support the successful entry and transition of underrepresented and underserved populations into STEM graduate education and into the STEM workforce. This broad suite of programs contributes substantially to the NSF investment in graduate education of the STEM research and education workforce of the future.

The LSAMP program provides funding to alliances comprised of multiple degree- granting organizations that can im plement comprehensive and Major Investments in STEM Graduate Students and Graduate Education NSF-Wide Investments - 42 sustained strategies that result in the graduation of well -prepared, highly- qualified students from underrepresented groups. The LSAMP -BD is a targeted activity where established alliances provide post - baccalaureate fellowship s to cohorts of students to obtain the necessary academic and research skills to successfully earn STEM doctoral degrees and transition to the STEM workforce. LSAMP -BD funding allows institutions to provide graduate stipend support ($32,000 per year) along wit h cost of education allowance to the institution for tuition, health insurance, and other normal fees up to $10,500 per year for up to two years of post -baccalaureate study. NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S- STEM) NSF established the S -STEM program in accordance with the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (P.L. 105- 277), as modified by P.L. 106- 313 and P.L. 108- 447 in 2005. The Act reflects the national need to increase substantially the nu mber of American scientists and engineers. In addition to the long -standing scholarship support, S -STEM projects contribute to the knowledge base of research in education by carrying out research on factors such as recruitment and retention of STEM student s. S-STEM is funded through H -1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account receipts. The S -STEM program provides institutions with funds for student scholarships to encourage and enable low-income, academically talented U.S. students with demonstrable financial need to enter the STEM workforce or STEM graduate school following completion of an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree in STEM fields. The program emphasizes the importance of recruiting students to STEM disciplines, mentoring and supporting student s through degree completion, and partnering with employers to facilitate student career placement in the STEM workforce. S -STEM provides individual scholarships of up to $10,000 per year, depending on financial need. Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) The Noyce program seeks to encourage talented STEM majors and professionals to become K -12 mathematics and science teachers. Through the Noyce NSF Teaching Fellowship track, funding supports STEM professionals who enroll as NSF Teaching Fellows in master's degree programs. The fellows are then able to earn teacher certification or licensing to teach a STEM discipline in an elementary or secondary school while they are fulfilling a four -year teaching commitment in a high -need school district. The Noy ce NSF Master Teaching Fellowship track provides support to experienced and exemplary K -12 STEM teachers, who are certified/licensed teachers that either possess a master's degree or are enrolled in a master's degree program in their field. The fellows par ticipate in mentoring and professional development activities to become highly effective master teachers and leaders. They are provided salary supplements while they fulfill a five -year teaching commitment in high -need school districts. The Noyce Teaching and Master Teaching track expects to fund about 120 fellows in FY 2020.

Centers exploit opportunities in science, engineering, and technology in which the complexity of the research program or the resources needed to solve the problem require the advantages of scope, scale, duration, equipment, facilities, and students. Centers are a principal means by which NSF fosters interdisciplinary research. Amount Percent Centers for Analysis & Synthesis $6.00 - $4.80 -$1.20 -20.0% Centers for Chemical Centers 46.40 - ActualFY 2019 (TBD)FY 2020 RequestChange over FY 2018 Actual Description of Major Changes Centers for Analysis and Synthesis - BIO The FY 2020 Request of $4.80 million funds one Center for Analysis and Synthesis \u2014the National Social - Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC). SESYNC, located at the University of Maryland, is dedicate d to accelerating scientific discovery at the interface of human and ecological systems. This center allows scientists from diverse disciplines to transform approaches for identifying solutions to society's most challenging and complex environmental proble ms. Workshops sponsored by this Center engage philosophers, sociologists, political scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, and environmental biologists (together with policy makers) to integrate broad disciplines from the outset and to set precedence for all subsequent activities. FY 2020 is the final year of the five- year renewal award and funding will provide continued support for staff and core research activities. Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) - MPS The FY 2020 Request of $19.0 million is expected to fund up to six Phase II CCIs, three continuing, one potential renewal, and up to two new centers. CCIs accelerate the solution of fundamental chemical research challenges, produce transformative research that leads to innovation, and attract broad scientific and public interest. CCIs respond rapidly to emerging opportunities through enhanced collaborations as well as initiate high risk / high reward projects. CCIs integrate research, innovation, education, broadening participation, and informa l science communication. Each CCI is focused on a chemistry challenge and assembles a multidisciplinary, multi -sector collaborative team. CCIs encompass synthesis, characterization, theory, modeling, data science and computation, along with training for students at all levels. CCIs are also actively engaged in knowledge transfer to industry and commercialization of their discoveries and new technologies. Each year, CCIs include nearly 100 participating academic institutions, 65 non- academic partner institu tions, and over 175 Senior Personnel, 100 Postdoctoral Associates, 255 Graduate Students, and 6 2 NSF Centers NSF-Wide Investments - 44 Undergraduate Students. The CCI program makes awards at two levels: smaller Phase I (three- year awards) for center development, and larger Phase II for full c enters (five- year awards with the potential for renewal for up to a total of ten years). In FY 2020 three continuing Phase II CCIs and one potential renewal will be funded. Five Phase I CCIs started in FY 2017 will also be eligible to compete for Phase II in FY 2020, out of which up to two new Phase II CCIs may be funded. A Phase I CCI competition will be held in FY 2020, supporting up to three new developmental awards. Phase I awards are considered part of the NSF Division of Chemistry's core research prog ram investments as they fall under the threshold for formal NSF center awards; thus, their funding is not captured here. The themes of the new Phase I CCI are varied and include the QL, URoL, and HDR Big Ideas, as well as sustainable chemical technologies, and other topics in advanced manufacturing. An independent CCI evaluation was funded in FY 2017 and is expected to be completed in late calendar year 2019. This evaluation is intended to inform both internal management and external stakeholders about the effectiveness of the CCI program in meeting its core mission. The CCI Program is unique within NSF in that it offers a Phase I on ramp to the larger Phase II competition. Evaluation of this on- ramp is expected within the overall CCI evaluation. Engineeri ng Research Centers (ERC) - ENG The FY 2020 Request is $54.66 million. This funding levels supports 17 NSF Engineering Research Centers. The total includes initial funding for three 4th -generation Engineering Research Centers that will advance convergent engineering research to tackle high -impact challenges and benefit U.S. security, prosperity, health and society. The new ERCs will implement new strategies for effective team formation and engagement with stakeholder communities to maximize their impacts. All NSF ERCs enable innovation, combining the energy and intellectual curiosity of university research focused on discovery with real -world engineered systems and technology opportunities through partnerships with industry. Since the program began in 1985, ERC products of innovation include more than 2,400 inventions disclosures, 2,000 patent applications filed, 800 patents awarded, and 1,300 licenses. The centers also have a successful track record for educating a technology -enabled workforce with hands - on, real -world experience. Together, the NSF ERCs have graduated 4,284 Bachelor's, 4,159 Master's, and 4,790 Doctoral degree students and impacted a total of 68,000 K -12 teachers and students. The NSF ERCs are effective at broadening participation from unde rrepresented groups. For example, across currently active ERCs, women comprise approximately 32 percent of those involved in center activities, in comparison to the national average of 16 percent across engineering. In addition, the percentage of underrepr esented minorities participating is more than double that of engineering's national average. The ERC program periodically commissions studies by external evaluators to examine aspects of the program, such as the effectiveness of ERC graduates in industry and the benefits of ERC membership to industry. In FY 2015, NSF funded the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study the future of center -based, multidisciplinary engineering research. The study report, delivered May 2, 2017, articulates a vision for the future of NSF -supported center -scale, multidisciplinary engineering research. After careful consideration, in FY 2018 ENG sparked new convergent engineering research collaborations through planning grants, providing 60 awards to bui ld capacity for a new generation of engineering research centers . In October 2018 (NSF 19- 503) ENG released a solicitation for the 4th generation of ERCs and anticipates awards in 2020 . The report 1 \"Post -Graduation Status of http://erc -assoc.org/sites/default/files/topics/Grad_ERC_Report-Final.pdf FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 45 augmented by a recent update, found that 29 of the 35 centers (83 percent) that graduated after 10 years of NSF support are self -sustaining, with most NSF ERC features in place and strong financial support from other governme nt sources and industry partners. Materials Centers - MPS This long -standing, flagship program will complete its triennial competition in FY 2020 and will fund up to nine new centers. MRSECs exist as hubs to solve complex grand challenge materials probl ems requiring broad complementary multidisciplinary expertise within the physical sciences and engineering to understand materials phenomena, exploit materials behavior, and to create and discover new materials. Through collaborative efforts involving acad emics, industry, national laboratories experts, and international and educational partners, MRSECs are a primary example of what is known as transdisciplinary convergent research which typically includes synthesis, theory, characterization, evaluation, and application in interactive feedback loops. MRSECs have five major components: (1) interdisciplinary research thrusts, (2) education and outreach, (3) industrial outreach/partnerships, (4) the materials research facilities network \u2014providing access to more than 1,250 state -of-the art equipment instrumentation to materials researchers across the Nation \u2014and (5) the SEED program which enables MRSECs to rapidly react/move into new high risk and potentially transformative areas not yet fully explored. Each year, MRSECs produce over 200 PhDs in STEM fields, mentor nearly 500 research experiences for undergraduate students and nearly 70 research experiences for teachers, and impact over 1 million students and parents through outreach activities such as summer camps, K-12 science curriculum development, K -12 in- school science demonstrations, development and deployment of science kits, and partnering with the Nation's top museums to create STEM -related exhibits that impact the public. Since 1994, the program has created over 161 startups and annually produces about 50 awarded patents and 30 patent licensures. MRSECs engage and assist about 250 industrial partners per year in advancing fundamental materials research that can be translated into the market place. The FY 2020 Request of $54.0 million is expected to fund 17- 18 Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSECs). FY 2019 will be spent preparing for the next MRSEC competition in FY 2020. This includes stimulating the seeding efforts built within each MRSEC to start addressing emerging research areas relevant to the Division of Materials Research. These areas include NSF's Big Ideas QL, FW -HTF, URoL, GCR, and HDR, as well as Materials Sustainable Development research. Informational sessions will take place at several u niversity campuses across the country; potential university applicants will be attending these sessions. Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships (STC) - multi- directorate The FY 2020 Request of $42.05 million will support twelve existing STCs ($41.50 million) and the costs of STC program management and oversight ($550,000). The twelve existing STCs are continuing awards from the FY 2010, FY 2013, and FY 2016 cohorts. FY 2020 is the last year for providing ramped down funding for the five centers in the 2010 cohort. The competition for the FY 2021 cohort begins in FY 2019. Currently, full STC awa rds are for five years, with possible renewal for an additional five years, or 10 years total. The award sizes of the existing STCs are approximately $5.0 million per year with ramp down in years nine and ten. The STC program advances interdisciplinary discovery and innovation in science and engineering through the integration of cutting -edge research, excellence in education, targeted knowledge transfer, and the development of a diverse workforce. The STC portfolio reflects NSF -supported disciplines. Exa mples include: engineering biological systems; energy -efficient electronics; new ways of handling the extraction, manipulation, and exchange of information; and new atomic scale imaging modalities. STCs engage the NSF Centers NSF-Wide Investments - 46 Nation's intellectual talent and collabora te with partners in academia, industry, national laboratories, and government. STCs strengthen the caliber of the Nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce through intellectually challenging research experiences for students, pos tdoctoral fellows, researchers, and educators; they advance public scientific understanding through partnerships with K -12 and informal education communities. The knowledge transfer activities focus on engaging stakeholders with the intention of supporting innovation, providing key information to public policy -makers, and disseminating knowledge from one field of science to another. To inform NSF about the progress of individual centers and the program as a whole, the STC program has developed a network of evaluators working with the centers to share information and lessons learned about the most effective way to measure progress.

Other parts of this chapter, NSF -Wide Investments, provide narratives for NSF - wide priority investments such as NSF's 10 Big Idea s, SaTC , INFEWS, and UtB. Additional cross -cutting programs at NSF are selected for present ation in the narrative below . Full funding data for these programs are provided in the Summary Tables chapter. ADVANCE In FY 2020, $18.0 million in funding is requested for the ADVANCE program to encourage institutions of higher education and the broader science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) community, including professional societies and other STEM -related not -for-profit organizations, to address various aspects of STEM academic culture and institutional structure that may differentially affect women faculty and academic administrators. As such, ADVANCE is an integral part of the NSF's multifaceted strategy to broaden participation in the STEM wor kforce and supports the critical role of the Foundation in advancing the status of women in academic science and engineering. Funding for ADVANCE in FY 2020 is consolidated into the EHR account, but the program will continue to fund projects in all areas o f STEM supported by NSF. Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) The CAREER program offers NSF's most prestigious awards in support of early -career faculty and is designed to provide stable support at a sufficient level and duration to enable awardees to develop careers not only as outstanding researchers but also as educators demonstrating commitment to teaching, learning, and dissemination of knowledge . The FY 2020 Request provides $249.14 million for the CAREER program , funding approximately 446 new CAREER awards, which support exceptionally promising college and university junior faculty who are committed to the integration of research and education and who are most likely to become the leaders in their fields. Funding for CAREER is provided by BIO, CISE, ENG, GEO, MPS, and SBE. Long -Term Ecological Research (LTER) The FY 2020 Request provides $ 28.43 million for LTER. LTER supports fundamental research that requires data collection over long time periods, to unravel the principles and processes of ecological science, which frequently involves long- lived species, legacy influences, and rare events. This program supports a loosely coordinated network of 28 field sites that focus on: (1) understanding ecological phenomena that occur over long temporal and broad spatial scales; (2) creating a legacy of well -designed, long- term ecological experiments; (3) conducting major syntheses and theoretical efforts; and (4) providing information to identify and to address environmental challenges. LTER projects represent a diversity of habitats in continental North America, the Caribbean, Pacific Ocean, Arctic, and the Antarctic; including coral reefs, arid grasslands, estuaries, lakes, prairies, forests, alpine and Arctic tundra, urban areas, and agroecosystems. Th e support for LTER in FY 2020 will be used to sustain site- specific research activities examining ecological and evolutionary dynamics in natural populations, communities, and ecosystems, some of which have been studied for over 30 years, and conducting sy ntheses of long -term data using contemporary modeling methods. Funding for LTER is provided by BIO and GEO . The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) infrastructure will be co -located at eight LTER sites. NEON is a continental -scale infrastructure facility providing standardized physical and data resources to researchers and educators. LTER is a network of long- term research projects aimed at understanding ecological processes in a wide range of ecosystems. Ongoing research at LTER sites may take advantage Selected Crosscutting Programs NSF-Wide Investments - 50 of data generated using NEON infrastructure. In addition, the co- location of NEON infrastructure at LTER sites will stimulate new research that builds on the long history of LTER research by enhancing the ability to extend site -based knowledge to regional and continental scales. For more information on NEON, see the NEON narrative in the Major Multi -User Research Facilities chapter. Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) In FY 2020, $76.37 million in funding is requested for the REU Sites and Supplements program. NSF's ongoing support for REU reflects the importance of undergraduate research experiences in building students' interest and competence in STEM disciplines. REU grants involve students at all stages of undergraduate education. REU Supplements allow students to join research projects that are supported by NSF research grants. REU Sites support cohorts of students to conduct research within STEM disciplines or on topics that cut across disciplines. Most of the students in an REU Site come from outside the host institution. This feature enables the program to involve students in research w ho might not otherwise have the opportunity, particularly students from institutions where faculty research activities are limited. The REU program encourages partnerships between community colleges and baccalaureate degree- granting institutions to provide research opportunities for community college STEM students and faculty. NSF's REU Sites and Supplements programs fall within the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education framework as affiliated programs, with budget and award decisions remaining within indi vidual directorates. Funding for REU is provided by BIO, CISE, ENG, GEO, MPS, and SBE. Research in Disabilities Education (RDE) The FY 2020 Request for NSF's RDE program totals $6.50 million. The RDE activity helps increase participation in STEM for postsecondary students with disabilities.

NSF's global change- related programs support the research and related activities to advance fundamental understanding of physical, chemical, biological, and human systems and the interacti ons among them. P rograms encourage interdisciplinary approaches to studying Earth system processes and the consequences of change, including how humans respond to changing environments and the impacts on ecosystems and the essential services they provide. NSF has been investing in the fundamental research at the heart of global change issues for several decades. Long- term, continuous, and consistent observational records are essential for testing hypotheses quantitatively and are thus a cornerstone of global change research. NSF supports a variety of research observing networks that complement, and are dependent on, the climate monitoring systems maintained by its federal partners. The results of NSF investments have helped communities address challenges associated with mitigation , adaptation, and other responses to a changing and variable environment. NSF funding for USGCRP in the FY 2020 Request is $ 224.10 million. NSF' s investments will continue to support research that contributes to the USGCRP Goal Areas to (1) advance scientific knowledge of the integrated natural and human components of the Earth sy stem and (2) i nform decisions by providing the scientific basis to i nform and enable timely decisions on adaptation and mitigation. In FY 2020, NSF will continue to engage with other USGCRP agencies on priorities from intra -seasonal to centennial predictability, predictions, and projections; water cycle research; understan ding the impacts of global change on the Arctic region and effects on global climate; and fundamental research on actionable science. In addition, NSF will further seek greater integration of social -science research, methodologies, and insights into unders tanding and supporting responses to global change, improving computing capacity, and maintaining needed observational capabilities over time. Past investments have helped inform the National Climate Assessment and several other technical reports mandated by the Global Climate Research Act of 1990. Investments have also aided U .S. communities to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies to address both challenges and opportunities derived from a changing environment. The fundamental knowledge gained thr ough NSF disciplinary and cross -cutting programs focusing on the coupled natural -human system are critical in developing effective solutions to these challenges and opportunities. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress NSF-Wide Investments - 61 FY 2020 Investments by Program Component Area (PCA) Goal 1: Advance scientific knowledge of the integrated natural and human components of the Earth system Earth System Understanding : Improving our knowledge of Earth's past and present climate variability and change through Multidisciplinary Earth and Human System Underst anding \u2014NSF participates in the Earth System Understanding PCA through activities to document and understand long -term climate cycles across the globe, as well as to better understand the natural variability of climate and the processes responsible for global changes using a range of paleoclimate and instrumental data and modeling approaches. NSF also supports activities to improve our understanding of the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events, particularly wet and dry extremes of the water cycle, their causes, and how those may be manifested in the future. Upgrading and expanding critical environmental observing systems are vital to these efforts. NSF also supports Earth System Understanding through activities spanning a broad range of disciplines and topics that seek to better understand the physical, geological, chemical, biological, and human components of the Earth system and their interactions. Examples of major foci include fundamental research on all aspects of the carbon cycle, t he water cycle, atmospheric composition and greenhouse gas processes, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and ocean and atmospheric circulations that both drive and respond to climate and global change. Human drivers of change include urbanization, populati on growth, and economic and technological development over a range of temporal scales. NSF has a strong commitment to fostering new interdisciplinary research approaches that allow exploration of the interdependencies across these areas. Integrated Observ ations : NSF contributes to the Integrated Observations PCA through its advanced capabilities to observe the physical, chemical, biological, and human components of the Earth system over multiple space and time scales. Facilities such as the Academic Resear ch Fleet and the National Ecological Observatory Network assist the Nation in gaining a fundamental scientific understanding of the Earth as well as monitor important variations and trends that allow the research community to examine major feedback process es between the climate and natural and human systems. Integrated Modeling : NSF will continue to devote significant resources to advancing climate modeling capabilities from global and centennial to regional and decadal scales. Since there is increasingly deep interplay among observations and modeling at multiple spatial and temporal scales, a high priority will be given to developing more complete representations \u2014models of coupled interactive atmospheric chemistry, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, biogeochemical cycling, and middle atmospheric processes. In addition, NSF is encouraging the development of ecosystem and water models at regional scales, as well as models that integrate human system components such as risk, vulnerability, and decision -making. Goal 2. Inform Decisions: Provide the scientific basis to inform and enable timely decisions on adaptation and mitigation Inform Adaptation and Mitigation : Assessing the Nation's vulnerability to current and anticipated impacts of global change through the science of adaptation and science to inform a daptation decisions. A key focus of the USGCRP is developing better means of assessing and responding to the impacts of global change as well as the vulnerability and resilience of both human and natural sy stems to those changes, particularly in highly sensitive regions such as the Arctic. In addition to supporting research that will inform adaptation decisions, NSF will also support fundamental research regarding the science of adaptation, defined as the adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment that exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates negative effects. This research ranges from developing the theoretical framework for evaluating adaptation options (and avoiding unint ended consequences of adaptation choices) to risk assessment and decision -making. NSF will continue interdisciplinary research (including human U.S. Global Change Research Program NSF-Wide Investments - 62 factors) in water sustainability, resiliency, biodiversity, ocean acidification, and vulnerable areas, particula rly in the rapidly changing Arctic.

Monitoring of activities funded as Mid- scale Research Infrastructure supported by the MREFC account has been added to the infrastructu re investment monitoring goal. NSF will also have one or more new Agency Priority Goals (APG) in FY 2020, covering the time period of FY 2020- FY 2021. These will be defined in FY 2019 and the first quarter of FY 2020, and published in early calendar year 2020 on performance.gov and in the FY 2021 NSF Request to Congress. F or the second year, NSF's APP supports the Renewing NSF effort, the agency -wide change initiative that arose from NSF's internal work over the summer of 2017 to implement agency reform per M-17- 22. NSF 1 www.nsf.gov/about/performance Performance Performance - 4 wrote Renewing NSF into its annual performance plans beginning in FY 2019: the FY 2018- 2019 APG to Expand Public and Private Partnerships supports one of the four pillars of Renewing NSF, and the existing goals in the Performance Plan that monitor inclusion, human resources, and information technology customer service were refocused to support Renewing NSF efforts in Workforce and IT. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 5 FY 201 8 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE PROGRESS UPDATES In FY 2018, the National Science Foundation conducted Strategic Reviews (SRs) of the six Strategic Objectives in its 2018- 2022 Strategic Plan, in response to the requirement of the GPRA Modernization Act 2010 Section 1116(f) . Table 1 summarizes the analyses performed and the outcomes to date of each SR. The table also provides NSF's determination as to whether performance towards an Objective is making noteworthy progress, should pursue focused improvement , or neither . Topic Selection and Conduct of the Strategic Review In FY 2018, NSF developed topics by following the 2017 recommendation to apply strategic review methods more broadly to decision -making. Five cross- cutting issues, where the traditional directorate -based decision -making framework was likely to prove infeasible, were identified and mapped to NSF's six Strategic Objectives, new in FY 2018 under the new Strategic Pla n. All were in response to larger administration activities which the Foundation was seeking to implement constructively and with minimal burden. Four arose from the agency reform effort, internally named Renewing NSF: workforce management, information tec hnology, partnerships, and internal process improvements. The fifth SR developed out of NSF's efforts to use learning agendas to guide evidence -based policymaking. The four Renewing NSF teams received the same charge: to assess the current status of the area, to develop a vision for their area, to relate it back to the larger Renewing NSF vision, and to identify next steps. A carefully facilitated Strategic Visioning process was used to accomplish this charge, to help teams define a compelling and collabo rative vision of the future and a broad but flexible strategy for achieving that vision. The Learning Agenda SR also followed a facilitated process, in which the NSF INCLUDES program management team reflected on its prior actions and considered how having a Learning Agenda would have contributed to decision- making at each step of the program's lifecycle. Both approaches prioritize d participatory decision- making, engaging dozens of participants in a novel collaborative approach to institutional learning and transformation. Results and Follow -Up All of the SRs generated broad suggestions for potential paths forward over the life of the new Strategic Plan. The Renewing NSF teams, i nstead of a focus on answering questions and developing prioritized recommendations, used the SR to articulate a vision for the future and suggest bold steps that could turn that vision into a reality. These visions and bold steps were used to generate wid espread agency buy -in, first among leadership and then among agency staff , in a process of engagements in the summer and fall of 2018. Due to its more focused scope, the Learning Agenda SR team made recommendations for particular actions regarding using ev idence to evaluate and inform programmatic decisions , practices that were reinforced by the eventual passage of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act. NSF's Performance Improvement Officer ( PIO) determined rankings by assessing the maturati on stage of each SR's implementation plans. Since the strategic reviews concluded in the summer of 2018, multiple mechanisms for agency engagement and collection of feedback on the possible ways forward have been implemented . Performance Performance - 6 Table 1. NSF's 2018 Strategic Reviews results summary, rankings , and progress updates. Strategic Objective and Ranking Summary of Strategic Review Findings Progress Update as of Spring 2019 Objective 1 .1 Knowledge Advance knowledge through investments in ideas, people, and infrastructure. Objective 1.2 Practice Advance the practice of research. Not Ranked Focus area: Renewing NSF: Streamlining, standardizing, and simplifying processes and practices (S3) . In this team's vision, s cientific d iscoveries and discoverers are cat alyzed and enabled by S3 processes and practices. The four components to this vision are: Priorities must reflect NSF values: Flexibility, Efficiency, Quality and Accuracy, Effectiveness, Inclusion, Focus on Mission; Evidence -based improvement becomes the NSF culture, leading to a dynamic, adaptive organization; S3 will yield time for higher impact work; and S3 must be achieved through, with and for NSF staff. Motivated by the SR , NSF is exploring ways to prioritize and distribute grantmaking workload across the fiscal year . Two automation projects were chosen to demonstrate short -term, high - yield progress: internal document clearance and compliance checking of incoming proposals against published criteria. Objective 2.1 Societal Impacts Support resea rch and promote partnerships to accelerate innovation and to provide new capabilities to meet pressing societal needs. Ranked as Noteworthy Progress Focus area : Renewing NSF: Expanding and deepening public and private partnerships . NSF envisions e xpanding partnerships to enhance the impact of its investments and contribute to American economic competitiveness and security. There are three components to this vision: A unified strategic vision to guide proactive identification and pursuit of partnerships that advance NSF's mission; Streamlined, flexible processes and tools for implementing a range of different types of partnerships, along with mechanisms for sharing knowledge and expertise; and Systematic and continual evidence- based improvement of costs and benefits of partnerships, through evidence- based assessment. The SR determined that a \"partnerships toolkit\" would be useful. The Partnerships Agency Priority Goal team is developing an \"MoU Builder\" tool, which would use pre -approved language and the answers to a set of standard questions to produce draft MoUs and focus the approval process on any non- standard areas. The APG team is also developing and testing a set of guiding questions to be asked early in the Partnership development process , which would ensure strategic alignment between NSF and its partners. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 7 Strategic Objective and Ranking Summary of Strategic Review Findings Progress Update as of Spring 2019 Objective 2.2 STEM Workforce Foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation. Not Ranked Focus area: SR of NSF INCLUDES t o illustrate a Learning Agenda . The SR team found that the Learning Agenda process, appropriately adapted, can support an overarching vision of NSF as a learning organization where policies and decisions are informed by evidence . It made three recommendations: 1. Provide infrastructure, tools, capacity, and resources for organizational learning. 2. Provide incentives for contributing to organizational learning. 3. Build organizational learning into the way we do our work. OIA's Evaluation and Assessment Capability section (EAC) co -led this SR in response to the Commission on Evidence - Based Policymaking's recommendation to \"Develop 'learning agendas' to identify evidence- building priorities and needs. \" EAC is spearheading pilot projects to inform implementation of the requirements of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act, which includes a mandate to establish and maintain Learning Agend as. Objective 3.1 Human Capital Attract, retain, and empower a talented and diverse workforce. Ranked as Noteworthy Area for Improvement Focus area : Renewing NSF: Adapting NSF's work and workforce . To ensure NSF has a w orkforce s killed to m eet the needs of the f uture , this team envisioned a workforce of the future where everyone can say: I add value and impact science. We work anywhere, anytime and with anyone. We broke down barriers and built up trust. NSF bridged the gap between skills and needs. My work has meaning and purpose, and we're inspired to reach our full potential. High performance is not only expected, but continually achieved. Goals 7 and 8 in the FY 2020 Annual Performance Plan in this Chapter measure activities that arose from and/ or support the direction suggested by this SR: To ensure that employee job requirements are aligned with competencies and skills needed for the future , starting in FY 2019, NSF is beginning to review and modernize existing position descriptions.

Multiple years of trend data are available for NSF's longstanding quantitative performance measures (Infrastructure Investments and Timely Proposal Decisions). Other performance goals monitor progress towards multiyear goals, such as implementation of a new process ( Improve Review Quality, Culture of Inclusion ), upgrades to ongoing processes ( Align Job Requirements, Improve User Interactions) , or strategically important investments (Key Program Investments, Expand Public and Private Partnerships). Performance Performance - 10 Goal 1, A gency Priority G oal: Expand Public and Private Partnerships Lead Organization s: Directorate for Biological S ciences , Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering . Goal Statement Expand public and private partnerships to enhance the impact of NSF's investments and contribute to American economic competitiveness and security. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 2 : Advance the capability of the Nation to meet current and future challenges. Objective 2.1, Societal Impacts: Support research and promote partnerships to accelerate innovation and to provide new capabilities to meet pressing societal needs. About t his Goal Private industry, foundations, and non- profits, together with other federal agencies and international funding organizations, bring additional expertise, resources, and capacity to NSF -funded research. This, in turn, accelerates discovery and translation of research to products and services, and enhances preparation of the future workforce to benefi t society and grow the American economy. Partnerships require significant time and intellectual capital, as well as strategic foresight, in their development. NSF will improve efficiencies in dev eloping, implementing, and managing partnerships to ultimately grow the number and scope of partnerships and maximize the sci entific, economic, and societal impacts of its investments. Discussion of FY 2018 Results To collect reliable information on the number and types of partnerships and/or award actions in use at NSF , an NSF -wide Implementation Team determined data sources and designed a data collection methodology and inventory instrument that would be uniform across all units in FYs 2017 (baseline year), 2018, and 2019. For the purposes of this APG, a partnership activity was defined as a formal agreement between NSF and at least one external, domestic stakeholder and for which there was investment , other quantifiable Current Year FY Target 2019 By September 30, 2019, NSF's number of partnerships and award actions with other federal agencies, private industry, and foundations/philanthropies will grow by 5 percent, relative to the FY 2017 baseline, to make available infrastructure, expertise, and financial resources to the US scientific and engineering research and education enterprise. Reporting Year FY Target Result 2018 None 2017 = 5 6 partnerships (baseline) 2018 = to be reported in June 2019 on performance.gov Previous Years This is a new goal in FY 2018 . The topic was identified as a priority from the agency reform/Renewing NSF process. FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 11 contribution, or new commitment formalized in the fiscal year. \"Formal agreements\" include, but are not limited to, Interagency Agreements (IAA) and Memoranda of Understanding (MOU). A partner was defined as the external stakeholder with whom NSF engages in a partnership activity. Part nership activities were categorized as interagency, private (including industry), and/or nonprofit/foundation, depending on the nature of the partners. Within NSF's 56 partnerships in FY 2017, 46 were with other agencies, seven were with the private sector , and three were with the nonprofit sector. Seven of the interagency partnerships also included one or more international partners. FY 2019 and beyond Reporting on this subset of NSF's partnerships will conclude at the end of FY 2019, although NSF expects to continue quantifying partnerships as appropriate . The working group is developing internal administrative tools, best practices , and processes to help NSF staff consider and evaluate the potential value of entering into new partnerships in the future. Use of these newly developed strategic resources will begin in FY 2019.

Achieved 2014 Monitor the progress of CEMMSS, CIF21, I -Corps, INSPIRE, SaTC, and SEES using a common set of milestones and indicators . Not achieved FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 13 About This Goal NSF instituted the Key Program Investments goal in FY 2014 to track the interim progress of major investments towards their long- term goals. Each year, NSF highlights a number of cross -agency investments in its Budget Request to Congress. Most are descri bed in the NSF -Wide Investments chapter of the Request. Although the overall impact of these investments might not be measurable for many years, tracking near -term indicators of progress can help the agency make formative changes or course corrections. NSF selects a subset of these investments for closer quarterly tracking by leadership, based on internal assessments of the value that tracking is likely to add. For example, new programs, programs with recent changes, or high -profile programs may particul arly benefit from the attention of leadership, and programs that are stably operating or sunsetting have reduced need for monitoring. Discussion of FY 2018 Results In FY 2018, NSF successfully monitored the progress of four NSF-wide investments \u2014Understanding the Brain (UtB) , Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems ( INFEWS ), Risk and Resilience, and NSF INCLUDES-using a common set of indicators and reviewed the results with senior leaders. The indicators that NSF chose to measu re were programmatic inputs and outputs that can provide valuable signals to managers and leaders about a program's health, such as whether the program is being administered as planned or whether the prog ram is generating enough interest from the community . The following were tracked quarterly in FY 2018: Input indicator: progress towards the investment's funding level target . Output indicators: solicitations issued, proposals r eceived, awards made. Investment -specific activities: defined by each investmen t in its roadmap, this can include PI meetings, Ideas Labs, workshops, and evaluation contract deliverables. These measures enabled managers and leaders to quickly gauge the status of a program's implementation, interest from the scientific community, whe ther the review process resulted in awards in a timely manner, and whether the program ha s met its internal goals for short -term outcomes. Tracking these measures over time provided managers and leaders with the opportunity to assess whether mid -course co rrections were needed to improve program management and/or the overall direction of the investment. FY 2019 and Planned FY 2020 Changes NSF plans a shift for this goal in FY 2019 to focus on monitoring the implementation of the 10 Big Ideas , which are bold inquiries into the frontiers of science and engineering. By investing in these efforts, NSF endeavor s to break down the silos of conventional scientific research to embrace the cross- disciplinary and dynamic nature of the science of the future. Si x of the Big Ideas are research ideas, which build on the foundation built by NSF in fundamental research over the last fifty- seven years. The Research Big Ideas are complemented by four process- related Enabling Big Ideas, which are areas in which research endeavors to improve the way in which science is done, from impacting the workforce to developing the infrastructure that will drive the discoveries and aid the discoverers of tomorrow's science. More information about the individual Big Ideas can be fou nd in thi s Request's Overview or in the NSF-Wide Investments chapter. All Big Idea programs issuing solicitations in FY 2019 will be monitored as a KPI in FY 2019. This focus is expected to continue into 2020, although the final decision will be made in the first quarter of that year. Goal Change History By design, this goal's monitored programs change annually to match the funding priorities of the year. In addit ion to the annual change in the list of monitored programs, described in the narrative and the table below , the G oal Statements have changed slightly each year for this goal, as follows: Performance Performance - 14 FY 2019: Ensure that key FY 2019 NSF -wide program investments are i mplemented and on track.

Goal Statement Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship of major research facilities and infrastructure. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 1: Expand knowledge in science, e ngineering, and learning. Objective 1.1, Knowledge : Advance knowledge through investments in ideas, people, and infrastructure. About This Goal The MREFC account supports the acquisition, construction, and commissioning of major research facilities and equipment that provide unique capabilities at the frontiers of science and engineering. Performance of construction projects funded by the MREFC a ccount is monitored using the Earned Value Management (EVM) system. EVM is an integrated management control system for assessing, understanding, and Current and Upcoming Years FY Target 2020 Construction Project Monitoring (MREFC and R&RA): For 100 percent of Major Facilities in the Construction Stage that are over 10 percent complete, and Mid-scale Research Infrastructure in the Construction Stage with a Total Project Cost (TPC) above $20.0 million that are over 10 percent complete and using Earned Value Management (EVM), keep negative cost and schedule variance at or below 10 percent. 2019 Construction Project Monitoring: For 100 percent of MREFC facilities under construction that are over 10 percent complete, keep negative cost and s chedule variance at or below 10 percent. Reporting Year FY Target Result 2018 Construction Project Monitoring: For all (100 percent) MREFC facilities under construction that are over 10 percent complete, keep negative cost and schedule variance at or below 10 percent. Achieved . Measure Information for All Years Monitoring 2014- 2018 and including targets for FY 2019- 2020Performance Performance - 16 quantifying what a contractor or field activity is achieving with program dollars. Monitoring cost and schedule is a standard measure of performance for construction projects. Projects that are under ten percent complete are not considered eligible for this goal because EVM data is less meaningful statistically in the very early stages of a project. Discussion of FY 2018 Results For more information about all projects currently funded from the MREFC account, see the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction chapter of this submission. All of the projects that w ere over 10 percent complete by the end of FY 2018 were on track . At the end of FY 2018, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) was 95 percent complete, the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) was 88 percent complete , and the Large Synoptic Survey Te lescope (LSST ) was 60 percent complete . Each project had cost and schedule variances well below the 10 percent thresholds. FY 201 9 and Planned FY 2020 Changes The net population of projects monitored by this goal is not expected to change in FY 2019. The NEON project is expected to complete construction during the FY 2019 reporting period, and the Regional Class Research Vessel (RCRV) project, to meet anticipated ocean science requirements for U.S. coastal waters, is expected to cross the percent compl ete threshold during FY 2019. In FY 2020, the population of projects will expand. The Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2019. It is anticipated that AIMS would then cross the percent comp lete threshold during FY 2020. Additionally, projects funded by the NSF Big Idea Mid -scale Research Infrastructure will be included within the project population for this goal. More specifically, those Mid-scale Research Infrastructure projects with a To tal Project Cost (TPC) above $20.0 million and using Earned Value Management (EVM) will be reported.

All targets achieved 2014 HRStat : NSF will develop a human capital ma nagement dashboard and establish quarterly reviews of HC metrics by senior management. PortfolioStat : NSF's IT governance boards will evaluate proposed investments and NSF will reduce IT costs. All targets achieved Performance Performance - 18 objectives. In FY 2014, NSF developed a first -generati on human capital management dashboard that included Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey scores and internal HR data. In FY 2015, the dashboard was updated to include three areas of focus for workforce initiatives that year: Employee Engagement, Recruitment and Retention, and Workload. In FY 2016, the dashboard and HRStat briefings were expanded to include data about Diversity and Inclusion. Federal regulations and OPM guidance governing HRStat changed in FY 2017 while NSF further expanded the scope of the HC and HR data it provided to leadership via HRStat briefings. Expanded HRStat briefings included progress updates toward agency HC goals established via NSF's Strategic Reviews, GPRA -MA, and OPM -required initiatives Hiring Excellence campaign). In FY 2018, NSF's HRStat program shifted to satisfy specific requirements of the new 5 CFR 250 regulations and OPM guidance. In its current form, NSF's HRStat program provides updates and data relative to the agency's Human Capital Operating Plan that is a ligned with, and a derivative of, the agency's strategic plan, annual performance plan, and agency reform plan (i.e., \"Renewing NSF\"). Portfolio Stat These targets monitor NSF's IT investment evaluation process. NSF's IT investments support the Foundation's business needs through a formal and disciplined IT investment review and decision- making process. Specifically, NSF's process for approving centrally -funded IT investments requires advocates for new IT investments to complete detailed justification an d business case documentation. This ensures that advocates for new IT investments have fully considered the business need, benefits, impacts, and strategic alignment of each potential investment. This also helps the CIO and governance boards verify that IT, rather than policy changes or business process reengineering, is the appropriate solution to a business need. The process provides NSF's CIO and governance boards the information needed to review, approve, and prioritize investment proposals using a c omprehensive evaluation methodology. Targets relating to monitoring of in- process investments cost and schedule data ensure that governance boards are aware of the progress and accomplishments for those investments that they recommended for funding. Discussion of FY 2018 Results HRStat NSF's performance target for HRStat in FY 2018 ensured that the agency's HRStat program contained metrics and targets for agency initiatives related to NSF's new strategic plan, new OPM and/or Administration initiatives, and NSF's agency reform plan. Portfolio Stat In preparation for the FY 2020 budget development, IT Governance groups carried out investment oversight activities to monitor the performance of all ongoing investments. Following established processes, the IT Governance groups evaluated the F Y 2020 planned priorities for all ongoing and new proposed investments, ensuring alignment to agency strategic priorities. FY 2019 and Planned FY 2020 Changes To align with agency reform/Renewing NSF efforts, this goal was modified in FY 2019 and beyond (see Goals 8 and 9) . HRStat and PortfolioStat continue within the CHCO and CIO reporting frameworks. Goal Change History FY 2014 HRStat 1.

At the time of this goal's establishment in the early 2000s, one of the most significant issues raised in customer satisfaction surveys was the time it takes NSF to process proposals , with dwell times only around 50 percent . Too long a time period inhibits the progress of research as it delays the funding p rocess, but too short a time period may inhibit the merit review process. The 70 percent target sought to strike a balance between the need of the investigator for timely action and the need of NSF for a credible and efficient merit review system. NSF's r esponse time has been consistently above 70 percent for nearly two decades, and m ore recent surveys have sho wn that Current and Upcoming Years FY Target 2020 75 percent. 2019 Reporting Year FY Target Result 2018 75 percent. Not Achieved. Result = 72 percent. Measure Information for All Years (see \"Goal Change History\" for details) FY including targets for FY 2019- 2020FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 21 this is now the second most common concern mentioned by PIs (see Goal 6, Improve Review Quality, for more recent survey results). Discussi on of FY 2018 Result Explanation of Unmet Goal NSF missed this goal in FY 2017 and FY 2018 for reasons related to the headquarters move at the end of FY 2017. NSF staff were directed to prioritize processing award decisions ahead of decline decisions in FY 2017 to facilitate an early close -out in advance of NSF's move to new headquarters in Alexandria. To reduce impact on individual employee performance, this goal was not included in any employee performance plans for the GWF performance period April 2017- March 2018. The FY 2017 result likely reflects this delay in decline processing and the FY 2018 result likely reflects this change in employee performance plans. FY 2019 and Planned FY 2020 Changes The 75 percent dwell time will continue. Goal Change History In FY 2015, this target was raised from 70 to 75 percent to be more in line with the historical trend of achievement between 75 and 80 percent . (The exception of FY 2014, in which NSF exceeded the 70 percent target by a historically lo w margin, was likely due to Foundation- wide delays in proposal processing after the lapse in funding authority in October 2013. ) Performance Performance - 22 Goal 6, Improve Review Quality Lead Organization: Office of Integrative Activities, Office of the Director. Goal Statement Improve the quality of written reviews of NSF proposals. Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 1: Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning, all Objectives Strategic Goal 3, Enhance NSF's performance of its mission. Objective 3.2, Processes and Operations: Continually improve agency operations. About This Goal This goal addresses and incorporates feedback NSF has received about its customer service. Committees of Visitors (COVs), program officers, and principal investigators frequently note that the quality of individual written reviews is variable. In 2015, NSF conducted a survey of researchers who were submitting Current and Upcoming Years FY Target 2020 By September 30, 2020, 1. 140 NSF programs will have had reviewers view the presentation \"Tips on how to write better reviews.\" 2. 10,000 reviewers of NSF proposals will have viewed \"Tips on how to write better reviews\" prior to preparing written reviews. 2019 By September 30, 2019, 1. 60 NSF programs will have had reviewers view the presentation \"Tips on how to write better reviews.\" 2. 8,000 reviewers of NSF proposals will have viewed \"Tips on how to write better reviews\" prior to preparing written reviews. 3. Improve the perceptions report ed by survey respondents in a repeat survey of proposers and reviewers. Increase the percentage of PI survey respondents who agree that written reviews are thorough from a baseline of 55 percent (2015) to 57 percent in FY 2019. Increase the percentage of PI survey respondents who agree that written reviews are technically sound from a baseline of 63 percent (2015) to 65 percent in FY 2019. Reporting Year FY Target Result 2018 By September 30, 2018, 1. 50 NSF programs will have held orientation sessions that include \"Tips on how to write better reviews.\" 2. 5000 reviewers of NSF proposals will have viewed \"Tips on how to write better reviews\" prior to preparing written reviews. 1. Achieved 2. Not achieved. Previous Years New goal in FY 2018 . FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 23 and/or reviewing proposals. Survey respondents identified the quality of reviews as the factor that would have the most significant effect on improving their proposals and fostering science (see chart below, n=22,174 respondents). A strategic review in the spring of 2015 recommended that NSF apply what was learned from the PI and reviewer survey to inform a new performance goal aimed at improving customer service. This goal was designed in response to that recommendation. This goal measures the implementation of a pilot program, initiated in December 2016, to improve the quality of written reviews of NSF proposals. The pilot encourages NSF programs to use the video presentation \"Tips on how to writ e better reviews\" early in the review process to orient reviewers and provide information on how to write more effective reviews. The assumption is that orienting reviewers before the reviews are written (as opposed to at the beginning of a review panel, a t which time the reviews have been drafted but not finalized) helps reviewers better understand and apply the review criteria. The intention is to make written reviews more useful to both principal investigators and NSF program staff. Discussion of FY 201 8 Results Through September 30, 2018, reviewers across 127 programs viewed the orientation video, exceeding the target of 50 programs. 3,022 reviewers viewed the orientation video prior to preparing written reviews, not reaching the target of 5,000 reviewers. Explanation of Unmet Goal Goals in their first year often take time to ramp up to full performance. After a midyear progress review, outreach within NSF and to the community was increased, which led to increased performance the second half of the fiscal year, resulting in exceeding the target for the number of programs. Of the two targets, the reviewer target was anti cipated to be harder to achieve. Increasing the number of programs can be done solely with outreach to NSF employees, but increasing the number of reviewers viewing the video involves influencing the b ehavior of thousands of external reviewers. Nevertheless, the outreach effort did lead to a sharp rise in the second half of the year in the number of reviewers who saw the video. FY 201 9 and Planned FY 2020 Changes NSF will conduct another survey in FY 2019 to learn whether the perceived quality of reviews has changed. Despite the funding lapse in Q2 of FY 2019, this survey is still scheduled for FY 2019. In light of the exceeded FY 2018 target, the target for number of programs was increased for FY 2020 to 140.

Achieved FY 20 20 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 25 Fostering inclusive work environments and realizing the full potential of the workforce's diversity requires agencies to employ effective management practices. NSF puts a high premium on diversity and inclusion: by engaging the talent of all our workforce, individuals are empowered to realize their full potential; by insuring that our workforce is diverse, our collective ability to deliver on our scientific mission is enhanced. NSF is always looking for ways to intensify and innovate diversity efforts throu gh active leadership and include and engage everyone in the workplace. This goal will encourage leaders to participate in engagement initiatives being used around the Foundation, including , but not limited to: New Inclusion Quotient (New IQ) workshops, Diversity and Inclusion Dialogues, Workforce Inclusiveness Assessment, Special Emphasis observances, Employee Resource Groups, unconscious bias awareness training, and inclusion learning activities for all employees. Discussion of FY 2018 Results Starting in FY 2016, this goal focused on bringing the New IQ process to NSF to increase the inclusion scores of specific organizational units. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs, developed the (New IQ) in FY 2013 to drive inclusive intelligence in the federal workplace. Inclusive intelligence is the intentional, deliberate, and proactive acts that increase work group intelligence by ensuring people feel they belong and are uniquely valued. The New IQ consists of 20 questions identified through a rigorous factor analysis trial of the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) questions with the highest correlation to inclusive environments. OPM's Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) developed a process to supplement use of the New IQ. The process uses a set of change management tools that equip agencies with instruments and practices necessary to support diversity and inclusion more fully. The 90 -day process is designed to help leaders strengthen their workplace teams to their fullest potential by leveraging unique exper iences, perspectives, and viewpoints of all members of the team. The most recent FEVS scores, or a self -survey conducted at the beginning of the ninety -day process, establish a baseline for the group, and the survey is distributed again at the end of the process. The expected outcome of the process is improved employee engagement levels, as measured by an increase in the overall New IQ scores and corresponding FEVS scores over time. In FY 2018, NSF used the New IQ process to improve scores across four organizational units by an average of 10 percent. FY 201 9 and Planned FY 2020 Changes In FY 2019, and beyond, this goal will expand beyond the New IQ to also count other inclusion activities. Goal Change History NSF has had a performance goal relating to diversity and inclusion since FY 2011. For five years, goals were largely focused on NSF's efforts to attain \"Model EEO Agency\" status. Inclusion represented a new direction for this goal since FY 2016. The focu s on leadership represents a new direction for this goal in FYs 2019 and 2020.

Measure, Milestone, or Deliverable Strategic Alignment Strategic Goal 3, Enhance NSF's performance of its mission . Objective 3.1, Human Capital : Attract, retain, and empower a talented and diverse workforce. About This Goal This goal incorporates principles from Renewing NSF, the agency operational reform plan initiated in FY 2017 in response to M -17-22. Technological improvements have automated many tasks once performed by NSF staff. Requirements for NSF's administrative staff have evolved from the more traditional competencies related to general clerical and office tasks such as categorizing, processing, and tracking paper forms to more advanced competencies related to the use of multiple automated data systems. Additionally, the inc reasing high number of proposals NSF receives, processed by the relatively stable number of program officers, means greater support is needed in data processing, data mining, analytics, and use of automated processes. NSF is also putting into place efforts to enable transdisciplinary, convergent research, and the agency needs to ensure its current and future workforce can adapt to this convergent approach. NSF will review and realign its workforce to ensure its greatest resource -its people -are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and abilities for success now and in the future. Ultimately, this will result in increased alignment between NSF's organizational structure, its core mission, and strategic plan. NSF will improve performance and increase accountab ility by systematically reviewing the NSF workforce from top to bottom. This review will allow NSF to revise position descriptions (PDs) that are outdated or do not reflect current and future work responsibilities. This PD modernization effort will enable NSF to identify the skills needed in today's work environment and will establish more relevant opportunities for training and developing NSF's existing workforce, while also enabling hiring managers to better target recruitment and outreach efforts to obta in the highest caliber of external candidates. FY 2019 and Planned FY 2020 Changes This is a n ew goal in FY 2019.

About This Goal This goal incorporates principles from Renewing NSF, the agency operational reform plan initiated in FY 2017 in response to M -17-22. As NSF positions itself to operate as a more agile organization, information technology will play a major role in enabling NSF's mission and allowing NSF to remain flexible to adapt to reform areas. NSF will look to leverage state- of-the-art IT solutions t o develop flexible tools that support the formation of agile work teams; to drive changes in the way research is solicited, identified, and funded; and to ensure user adoption is achieved to the maximum extent possible while also easing the use of IT systems. This emphasis on efficiency and improved service to end users will ensure that IT responds rapidly to changes in the way NSF is organized and carries out its mission, with the goal of ensuring that NSF IT tools minimize staff workload and simplify deci sion-making by providing accurate data, easy -to-use interfaces, and readily available and reliable access.

FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 29 FY 201 8 MANAGEMENT CHALLENG E PROGRESS REPORT Background Under the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000, NSF's Inspector General is required to summarize what it considers to be the most significant management and performance challenges facing NSF in the coming year in a memo to the NSF Director. The management challenges are identified by NSF's Inspector General and announced at the beginning of each fiscal year. In response, the Director issues a memo to acknowledge receipt of the OIG Management Challenges and to provide a report on NSF's progress and achievements made over the prior year. The OIG's challenges, NSF's response, and NSF's progress update towards addressing previously ident ified challenges are included in the annual Agency Financial Report (AFR) published in November on NSF's website. 1 This section provides NSF's progress report highlighting the significant actions taken in FY 2018 on the management challenges identified by NSF's Inspector General at the beginning of that fiscal year. Enterprise Risk Management Starting in FY 2018, NSF 's Progress Report applied its Enterprise Risk Management framework to document its assessments of the inherent and residual risks for each of the OIG's Challenges for FY 2018, including actions to mitigate risks. NSF management's overview of the challenges presented represent NSF's view of the residual risk in light of the key actions NSF has already taken to address the OIG - identified challen ge. Further, NSF management developed the anticipated milestones in consideration of NSF's strategic objectives, the risks inherent to NSF's work, and the key actions NSF has already taken to address those risks. In response to NSF's incorporation of ERM principles in its FY 2018 report, the OIG updated its reporting format for FY 2019, and recognized NSF's progress by removing two Management Challenges cited for FY 2018: Management of the Government's Records and Cybersecurity and Info rmation Technology Management. These changes in NSF's and OIG's reports enable constructive dialogue between NSF and the OIG about risk , and advance fulsome consideration by NSF of the OIG's new challenges.

NSF's Key Actions to Address the Challenge Agency Actions Taken in Prior Fiscal Years Strengthened controls over NSF's major facility portfolio through the development of several new policies and procedures in FY 2016 and FY 2017 including: (1) retaining a portion of the recipients' contingency funds; (2) periodically conducting cost incurred audits; (3) completing a cost proposal review for reasonableness of proposed costs; (4) obtaining an independent cost review of the proposed budget; (5) conducting earned value management system verification, validation and acceptance; and (6) reviewing proposed fees and requiring recipients to track fee expenditures. Developed the Major Facilities A -123 Oversight Process Narrative and revised the Large Facilities Manual (LFM) to incorporate new guidance for recipients related to cost estimating and analysis. Actions Taken in FY 2018 Appointed a new Chief Officer for Research Facilities (CORF) in the Office of the Director to ensure agency -wide acceptance of policies and procedures related to oversight of major facilities. Appointed Accountable Directorate Representatives (ADR) in each Directorate with major facilities and formed the Major Facilities Working Group (consisting of the ADR's) to rev iew and socialize policies and procedures related to the oversight of major facilities. Formed the Facilities Governance Board to approve major facility oversight policies and procedures at the agency level. Revised the Integrated Project Team (IPT) Standard Operating Guidance (SOG) to include facilities in the Operations Stage. Developed the Core Competency SOG to codify the minimum competencies for the core IPT members. Conducted an independent third- party review of NSF's strengthened policies and procedu res related to cost surveillance. NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge NSF understands the importance of overseeing its recipients' management of major facility awards. The agency also recognizes the importance of assessing prospective recipients' ca pabilities for managing proposed awards. Over the past several years, NSF has been in the process of strengthening its policies and procedures as illustrated above. This includes an annual major facilities portfolio risk assessment to determine the necessary BFA -led reviews and audits to be conducted by the Large Facilities Office (LFO) and the Cooperative Support Branch (CSB). In close cooperation with program, LFO and CSB conduct the reviews described above, which were specifically created to safeguard NS F's investments in supporting the scientific endeavor. NSF leadership has shown its commitment to oversight in the past several years by strengthening the LFO and in establishing the new CORF position. The new governance structure now in place will help en sure consistent implementation of its expanded controls for major facilities oversight. NSF has recently undergone a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review related to its No Cost Overrun Policy and oversight practices related to recipient cost and schedule development. In the June 2018 report entitled National Science Foundation: Revised Policies on Developing Costs and Schedules Could Improve Estimates for Large Facilities (GAO- 18-370), the GAO recommended that NSF should revise its policies for estimating and reviewing the costs and schedules of large facilities projects to better incorporate FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 31 the best practices in GAO's guides. NSF agreed with the GAO recommendations and has a corrective action plan in place to address the findings. Based on NSF's risk -based evaluation of this Management Challenge, coupled with activities already completed and those planned for FY 2019, NSF has determined that the residual risk impact is \"very low\" and the likel ihood is \"low.\" NSF is confident that its current and planned policies and procedures related to major facility cost and schedule oversight adequately consider and balance risk, resources, and stewardship of federal funds. NSF's Anticipated Milestones Anticipate receipt of independent third -party report related to cost surveillance - Q1 FY2019. Finalize Selection of Independent Cost Estimate Review SOG already implemented in practice - Q1 FY2019. Describe the purpose and customary methods for sensitivit y analysis and application of GAO's 12 steps of a high -quality cost estimating process (LFM Section 4.2) - Q3 FY 2019. Finalize and align BFA SOGs related to selection of independent cost estimate reviews, standardized cost analysis, and pre- award budget r eviews to specifically address American Innovation and Competitiveness Act requirements and GAO good practices - Q4 FY 2018. Develop and implement a new Major Facilities Review SOG to more fully utilize external review panels in addressing elements of cost and schedule - Q2 FY 2019. Create a new LFM Section 4.3, Schedule Development, Estimating, and Analysis - Q3 FY 2019. Update BFA Cooperative Support Branch's Standardized Cost Analysis Guidance SOG to include assessment of schedule due to the potential impact scheduling has on costs - Q4 FY 2018. Performance Performance - 32 Business Operations Management : Improper Payments Lead: Chief Financial Officer Summary of OIG Identified Challenge (a) Ensure proper payments to awardees for the $7 billion issued annually in grant and cooperative agreement payments without verification; (b) address substantial concerns with the depth, substance, and documentation of t he NSF risk assessment; (c) address significant limitations in NSF's analysis of six of the nine OMB risk factors; and (d) improve assessment of NSF payments to employees. NSF's Key Actions to Address the Challenge Agency Actions Taken in Prior Fiscal Y ears Developed and published SOG for improper payments risk reviews incorporating the nine Improper Payment Elimination and Recovery Act ( IPERA ) risk factors and additional considerations from the OIG review report. Completed improper payments risk reviews for FY 2016 and FY 2017. The risk reviews included input from subject matter experts (SME s) for grants, contracts, charge cards, and payments to employees. Both reviews concluded that NSF did not have a significant risk of improper payments. OIG in spection of the FY 2016 and FY 2017 risk reviews found NSF in compliance with IPERA requirements. Actions Taken in FY 2018 Conducted advanced and baseline grant monitoring activities including grant payment testing. Operated, evaluated, and reported on an effective internal controls program providing assurance that NSF controls over grant and grant payment processes are properly designed and operating effectively. Collaborated with the OIG, BFA, and program offices on risk reduction activities including completion of an initial fraud risk assessment for grants under the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act. Completed an improper payments risk assessment for FY 2018 that built on the improper payments risk reviews completed during FY 2016 and FY 2017. NSF M anagement's Overview of the Challenge NSF appreciated the OIG's current determination of NSF's compliance with IPERA and closure of all recommendations from the previous OIG reports. The reports clearly validate that NSF has taken the steps necessary to d emonstrate compliance and effectiveness in the agency's implementation of IPERA because NSF has: Demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support to incorporate risk management concepts into business processes and management functions; Ensured tha t NSF has the people and resources to effectively comply with IPERA by assigning a senior staff associate responsible for coordinating and integrating risk management and program integrity activities; Developed and completed a corrective action plan in Jul y 2016 that addressed the root causes of the IPERA reporting issue, implemented solutions, and completed all OIG recommendations; Established processes to monitor and validate the effectiveness and sustainability of the corrective measures; and Incorporate d corrective measures into policy and process documentation. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 33 NSF's Anticipated Milestones Continue advanced and baseline grant monitoring activities including grant payment testing. Continue internal controls program activities to provide assurance that NSF controls for its payment processes are operating effectively. Continue collaboration with the OIG on risk reduction activities. Continue to improve improper payments risk assessment and reporting compliance activities. Performance Performance - 34 Business Operations Manageme nt: DATA Act Lead: Chief Financial Officer Summary of OIG Identified Challenge Address challenges set forth in OIG audit report 18 -2-001, dated November 17, 2017, reporting on the OIG's assessment of completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of data submitted by NSF in accordance with the DATA Act. NSF's Key Actions to Address the Challenge Actions Taken in FY 2018 Developed and implemented Corrective Action Plan in response to the FY 2017 audit with the following actions: Examined processes identified as potential audit risks, identified ways to improve or strengthen the processes, and documented changes in NSF's standard operating procedures. Submitted corrections for any data errors identified in the audit. Included comments with NSF's submissions to explain legitimate differences between File C (Award and Financial Detail) and Files D1/D2 (Financial Assistance and Procurement Award and Awardee Attributes). Reviewed submission process with the internal controls team and identified opport unities for improvement. Performed policy review of the application of \"legitimate differences\" guidance to warnings when linking Files C to D1/D2. Worked closely with the DATA Act Audit Collaboration Working Group of the CFO Council (CFOC) and the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) to identify issues to be addressed to improve DATA Act implementation and clarify government -wide guidance and audit standards. Worked with a subgroup of the Financial Assistance Committee for E -Government (FACE) in collaboration with a DATA Act Internal Control subgroup of the CFOC to provide a solid framework and data quality plan template that agencies can leverage and customize to develop their own data quality plans. Initiated implementation of OMB Circular A -123 Appendix A, requiring agencies to maintain a Data Quality Plan that considers the incremental risks to data quality in federal spending data and any controls that would manage such risks. NSF's data quality plan will leverage the e xisting plans for the Financial (Files A -C) and Procurement (File D1) data as well incorporate the new data quality requirements for the Financial Assistance (File D2) data. Reviewed SharePoint processes to ensure all required BFA Division Director validat ions are complete, properly labelled, and available for Senior Accountable Official (SAO) review. NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) is a government -wide initiative led by OMB and the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) to standardize and publish the federal government's wide variety of reports and data compilations related to spending: financial management, payments, budget actions, procurement, and assistance. On April 28, 2017, NSF s uccessfully met the DATA Act's requirement for federal agencies to begin submitting data to Treasury. From the outset, NSF prioritized DATA Act implementation, initially naming an SAO from the Office of the Director and later transitioning that role to th e NSF Chief Financial Officer where it remains. The agency allocated appropriate resources to both the implementation and operations phases of its DATA Act work, leveraging agency staff from BFA and OIRM as well as contract resources. Early on, NSF recogn ized the importance of government -FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 35 wide engagement and earned the Treasury Secretary's Certificate of Appreciation in recognition of NSF's outstanding commitment to collaboration on this government -wide implementation challenge. The DATA Act required the O IG of each federal agency to review a sample of the financial data submitted by the agency and report on its completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy, as well as the implementation and use of consistent data standards by each agency. The NSF OIG issued its report on November 17, 2017. NSF generally agreed with the audit recommendations and has addressed them all, developing corrective actions that have been resolved and closed by the OIG. In connection with this work, NSF staff conducted a root cau se analysis of its challenges, noting that many of the OIG -identified errors were government -wide in nature and beyond NSF's control, which the OIG recognized in its report. Among the corrective actions NSF has implemented is the agency's continued lead ership and engagement in government -wide DATA Act -related work. On June 6, 2018, OMB issued new guidance, Appendix A of OMB Circular A -123, superseding prior DATA Act guidance and creating a requirement for agencies to develop data quality plans that incl ude management assurance in the quality of its data. NSF analysis confirmed that the prior guidance had dramatically amplified NSF error rates because auditors relied on it to evaluate errors at the transaction level, rather than at the data element level . Agencies will now be audited against the revised approach, and NSF is confident that the agency's reported error rate will drop significantly as a result. NSF's progress on the DATA Act has been enabled by the NSF Deputy CFO's deep engagement in suppor ting the activities relating to the Audit Collaboration Working Group of the CFOC and CIGIE, which will develop agency best practices for implementing the new guidance. The CFOC is also collaborating with GAO and CIGIE as they develop their related audit guidance, which will take the new OMB guidance into account. In addition, the NSF Division Director for BFA's Division of Institution and Award Support and other NSF senior staff are supporting the government -wide financial assistance community's work to develop a framework for the required data quality plans, which NSF will leverage as it prepares its own required plan. Based on NSF's risk -based evaluation of this Management Challenge, along with the causes analyzed and actions that NSF has taken to dat e, NSF believes that its risk of reporting inaccurate, incomplete, and untimely data has been significantly reduced. NSF's Anticipated Milestones Participate in government -wide working groups to develop a DATA Act Playbook to support federal agencies' compliance and audit readiness; Develop an NSF DATA ACT data quality plan; and Monitor changes to NSF systems to determine impact on DATA Act reporting.

Continue initiatives to reduce the amount of paper, supplies and equipment that NSF uses and stores given less office space available in the new NSF headquarters as well as efficiently and effectively manage the scanning/digitiz ation effort to reduce the amount of paper. Provide updated records management training to staff in accordance with NARA Bulletin 2017- 01 (Agency Records Management Training Requirements). NSF's Key Actions to Address the Challenge Agency Actions Taken in Prior Fiscal Years Verified and validated the accuracy of the report on records that were 30- years old or more and determined there are no records meeting this criterion in existence within the agency. (October 2015) Conducted a review of records at the Federal Records Center (FRC) locations where agency records are stored and determined that no unscheduled records remain there. (October 2015) Began presenting an overview of general records management responsibilities at NSF's New Employee Orientation se ssions. (August 2017) Revised NSF records management training course to cover all NARA -required elements. (June 2017) Scanned over 7,000 permanent and temporary records from August 2016 to August 2017 during the process of relocating to the new NSF headquarters as part of an agency -wide \"green\" initiative to eliminate paper and property. The initiative ultimately reduced 1,200,000 pounds of paper and property, compared to a goal of 500,000 pounds. Actions Taken in FY 2018 (a) (b) (c) Issued NSF Bulletin 18-05, Records Management Program, and NSF Bulletin 18- 04, Managing Records in Electronic Messages, to identify staff responsibilities at all levels of the agency. Issued guidance for executing NSF's Capstone Officials' Email Management Program under Bulle tin 18- 03. Issued NSF Bulletin 18- 12, Managing Email of Supervisory, Support and/or Administrative Personnel as Records Classified OIG and Office of the General Counsel's electronic records as official records. Completed an analysis of records at the FRC. Implemented blacklist capability on NSF - managed mobile devices to prohibit restricted application downloads. Implemented a full -text search capability in the Electronic Records Management System (ERMS). Created an online training for the ERMS. Issued NSF Bulletin 18 - 06, Required Records Management Training, to implement new requirement for all staff to take annual records management training. New personnel on boarding after April 30, 2018 are required to complete the course within 60 days of employment and annually each fiscal year thereafter. All other personnel are required to complete this course by September 30, 2018, and annual ly each fiscal year thereafter. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 37 Issued updated NSF Bulletin 18 -07, Mobile Communications Devices, to include guidance related to electronic records on NSF-issued smartphones. Updated mobile device rules of behavior to comply with NSF Bulletin 18- 07. Added instructions to the agency's standard operating procedures (SOP) for social media on how to capture and retain records in social media posts on NSF accounts. NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge NSF is on track to comply with NARA's 2012 directive (M -12-18) to take specific actions by appointed dates to reform the policies and practices for the management of government r ecords. The agency has committed appropriate resources to prioritize its compliance and has already met the requirements for Goal 2 in the 2012 directive. NSF's anticipated milestones focus on completing the requirements for Goal 1 and ensuring it maintain s compliance with Goal 2. The Foundation has worked closely with senior management and the OIG to formulate corrective action plans that outlined many of the actions taken in FY 2018 and to be taken in the future. Actions taken to- date have significantly r educed the inherent risk, such as non- compliance and lost records, to a low level. The NSF digitization project in preparation for the move to Alexandria was a great success. Multiple offices around the building not only reduced their paper footprint to f it into their new space, but now have excess storage capacity they are looking to repurpose. Among other benefits, NSF's above -described actions reduced the inherent risk associated with paper records, including space limitations and loss of records; there fore, the agency plans to continue to promote digitization of paper records. NSF records management training content and policy complies with NARA Bulletin 2017- 01. Formalized, required records management training will promote transparency and accountabil ity in the management of federal records. NSF implementation of this training has addressed the inherent risk set forth in the OIG's management challenge, bringing the residual risk to a low level. Agency progress in this area is demonstrated by the result s of the NARA on -site assessment conducted in May 2018 where NARA reviewed NSF's Records Management Training Program and policies related to records management. Senior staff within the NSF Division of Administrative Services Records Management Section were engaged with NARA and demonstrated the new Records Management for Everyone and eRecords Management System online training courses. NARA reviewed five recently issued records management - related NSF Bulletins. At the end of the assessment, NARA praised the training modules and bulletins, and said they would like to highlight NSF's records management program as a model for the federal government. NSF's Anticipated Milestones (a) (b) (c) Update remaining records schedules to classify electronic records as official agency records and get approval from the Archivist of the United States by the end of FY 2019. Issue a policy on managing email of supervisory, support, and administrative personnel as records by December 2018. Destroy all records at the FRC that have met their disposition date by the end of FY 2018. Complete an agency - wide records inventory by November 2018. Monitor compliance with annual records management training requirement for staff utilizing LearnNSF automatic tracking capability. Performance Performance - 38 Complete the NARA 2019 Annual Record s Management Self -Assessment, the Annual Federal Email Management Report, and the Annual Senior Agency Official for Records Management Report by April 2019. Implement a tool for automated capture of text messages on NSF -managed mobile devices by November 2 018. Continue to scan records to put in ERMS. Initiate quarterly workshops for NSF -wide Division Records Custodians by December 2018. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 39 Business Operations Management: Subrecipient Monitoring Lead: Chief Financial Officer Summary of OIG Identified Challenge Transparency and oversight of NSF funds passed through to subrecipients (e.g. ensure awardees review sufficient cost information to demonstrate that subrecipients' costs are allowable, fair, and reasonable). NSF's Key A ctions to Address the Challenge Actions Taken in FY 2018 Piloted a Targeted Review Assessment (TRA) methodology to assess compliance with prime awardee oversight of subrecipients. Reviewed NSF's Advanced Monitoring Program subaward module assessment protoc ols based on TRA findings and Uniform Guidance requirements. Continued to require prime awardees to take corrective actions for findings related to subaward monitoring. Continued practice of applying 1 to 5 risk points to awards containing subawards at or exceeding $100,000 as part of NSF's annual risk assessment process. Updated the standard NSF budget form to eliminate awardee confusion around subcontracts vs. subawards. The form now only allows for subawards. Changed award notification language to reflec t subaward vs. subcontract. Updated NSF's fact sheet on subrecipient monitoring to reference requirements in 2 CFR \u00a7200.331 for pre- and post -award monitoring. NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge Historically, NSF has understood the importance of ov erseeing its recipients' management of large and multiple subawards. The Foundation also recognizes the importance of assessing prospective awardees' capabilities for managing proposed subawards. NSF currently has in place a risk -based approach to oversee its award recipients' subaward management through advanced monitoring activities, including Advanced Monitoring Site Visits, Desk Reviews, and Business Systems Reviews (BSRs). NSF leadership has shown its commitment to oversight for nearly two decades by t he establishment and continued support for the Division of Institution and Award Support (DIAS) and the Large Facilities Office (LFO) within NSF's Office of Budget, Finance, and Award Management . These offices were specifically created to safeguard NSF's i nvestments in science and conduct the reviews described above. NSF also assesses risk related to subaward monitoring during its pre -award reviews, specifically for proposals of $10M and greater. Advanced pre -award reviews are handled by expert cost analyst s within DIAS, and NSF also utilizes expert advice of outside sources as warranted. NSF has recently undergone an OIG audit of the agency's monitoring of recipients managing subawards. The OIG stated that \"in most cases, NSF's processes for monitoring gr antees were sufficient to ensure that pass- through entities monitored subrecipients properly.\" The audit report recommended that NSF strengthen several policies and procedures to better align with the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR \u00a7 200) as it relates to subreci pient compliance. NSF agreed with all OIG recommendations, has already acted on several issues, and intends to take additional actions to address all recommendations in the audit report pursuant to a corrective action plan. Based on NSF's risk -based evalu ation of this process, coupled with the extensive OIG audit of this area, NSF believes that the residual risk to the agency is low and is consistent with NSF's low risk appetite for misuse of funds and non- compliance with reporting and performance requirem ents. NSF is confident that its current pre - and post -award processes adequately consider and balance risk, resources, and stewardship. Performance Performance - 40 NSF's Anticipated Milestones Revise DIAS's Subrecipient Review module to require review of awardee compliance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.331 by October 2018. Revise the DIAS Over -$10M SOG to align with 2 CFR \u00a7 200 as it relates to the agency's responsibility to oversee its prime recipients managing subawards by October 2018. Revise the BSR Guide to align with 2 CFR \u00a7 200 as it rel ates to the agency's responsibility to oversee its prime recipients managing subawards by November 2018. Revise the Large Facilities Manual to align with 2 CFR \u00a7 200 as it relates to the agency's responsibility to oversee its prime recipients managing subawards by June 2019. Revise the \"DACS/CSB Standardized Cost Analysis Guidance\" to align with 2 CFR \u00a7 200 as it relates to the agency's responsibility to oversee its prime recipients managing subawards by September 2018. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 41 Management of the IPA Program Co-Leads: Assistant Director, BIO and Office Head, OIRM Summary of OIG Identified Challenge (a) (b) (c) (d) Because individuals can serve in a temporary capacity for up to four (4) years, there is frequent turnover in staff at NSF, especially in senior leadership positions. The amount of time IPAs spend on Independent Research/Development (IR/D) at their home institution raises concern about the ability of IPAs to fulfill their responsibilities at NSF and to be fully engaged in the agency's mission. NSF' s reliance on IPA's comes at an added cost because IPAs are not subject to Federal pay and benefits limits. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) requires a report on NSF's efforts to control costs associated with IPAs. NSF could strength en some of its internal controls to improve NSF's ability to identify and or mitigate IPA conflicts of interest. NSF's Key Actions to Address the Challenge Agency Actions Taken in Prior Fiscal Years (a) Established an ongoing culture of staff development to ensure that there is a \"bench\" of staff ready for developmental detail assignments in the event that there are vacancies in executive positions, to include the Federal Executive Institute (FEI), American University Executive Leadership Program, Harvard Business School Leadership Training, Individual Development Plans, and NSF Academy training activities. Developed and implemented a new employee onboarding program, the New Executive Transition Program (NeXT) in 2009 (NSF has historically held new employe e onboarding sessions that include IPAs). The NeXT program supports the onboarding of employees and IPAs transitioning into executive -level positions. The program provides a comprehensive set of tools and information to help new executives reach full performance as quickly as possible by developing executive knowledge about NSF mission, culture, organization, people, and business processes. The NeXT Program currently includes a three- day Executive Leadership Retreat and a one- day Oversight of Merit Review, which applies to most executive IPAs. NSF also offers executive coaching to help IPAs and all executives understand their new roles and navigate the Federal environment. Instituted mandatory and optional training for Program Officers, who comprise a lar ge proportion of IPAs, on NSF's Merit Review process which teaches how research proposals are evaluated and how to execute the Program Officer role. There is a Merit Review Basics series (MRB I through MRB IV), and the first two modules have been required since 2011 and the remaining two are optional. NSF is in the process of changing the requirement to include all four one -day modules. There is also an optional two- day capstone workshop called the Program Management Seminar which is typically taken by a ma jority of Program Officers (including IPAs). Created a parallel performance management system in 2014 for IPAs to ensure clarity in setting expectations and providing feedback on performance. Established a knowledge transfer process in 2015, by which exiting executives can transfer key pieces of knowledge and information to incoming executives. Implemented a required three- day supervisory training and development course in 2015 called Federal Supervision at NSF designed to assist new federal supervisor s (including IPAs) in understanding their roles and all of the requirements pertaining to federal human capital management. Performance Performance - 42 Established a Steering Committee for Policy and Oversight of the IPA Program (IPA Steering Committee) in April 2016 to serve as the primary body for considering policy on NSF's use of IPAs, and to oversee common approaches to budgeting and implementation of the IPA program. A key responsibility of the Steering Committee is to develop and track metrics related to the use of IPAs. (b) Established an IR/D Council in October 2011 to develop and monitor internal controls related to the IR/D program, including tracking the time spent on IR/D activities. Data from these internal controls are disseminated to NSF senior management quarterly , for use in managing the IR/D program within each organization. Developed an IR/D Guide in 2012 to clearly communicate NSF policies on the use of IR/D, including the possibility that participation in the IR/D program could be curtailed if it compromised the completion of NSF duties. Designated IR/D experts in each Directorate/Office who receive annual training to ensure that NSF policies are implemented appropriately. Instituted a requirement that a ll IR/D plans provide an explanation of how the IR/D activiti es enhance the requestor's ability to perform NSF duties. Published a revised IR/D Guide in January 2017 that includes guidance limiting NSF payment of IPAs' IR/D travel to their home institutions to 12 trips per year. The guidance encourages IPAs to combine other NSF official business and/or telework with these trips to get the most efficien t use of those travel dollars. (c) Completed an IPA Steering Committee analysis of costs associated with the IPA program in FY 2016 and determined that the incremental cost of the program (i.e., computing the cost differential if the positions held by IPAs were instead filled with federal e mployees) was approximately $5M (or 0.07% of the NSF budget). Proportionally, this cost differential only nominally increases the total IPA program costs. As part of this analysis, the IPA Steering Committee did identify opportunities for potential cost s avings, and NSF in turn initiated a pilot requiring 10% cost sharing by IPAs' home institutions of their academic- year salaries and fringe benefits (per NSF Bulletin 16- 11). This pilot applies to all new IPA agreements initiated in FY 2017 and beyond, including those for executive and program level staff. Additionally, NSF eliminated reimbursement for lost consulting. Designed and began data collection for an evaluation led by the NSF Office of Integrated Activities Evaluation and Assessment Capability t o determine the cost implications associated with the 10% cost sharing pilot and the extent to which the policy change impacts NSF's ability to recruit strong IPAs. Received notice from the OIG closing the sole open audit recommendation related to IPA costs as a result of these efforts. Recommendation closed in February 2017. (d) Continued to apply the same suitability, credentialing, and security vetting process for employees and IPAs alike, and to require IT security and privacy training for all employees and IPAs for physical and logical access to facilities and systems. Contin ued to implement NSF's long- standing policy with respect to statutory and perceived conflicts of interest (COIs) for staff and reviewers. Staff who manage the merit review process are required to take training on the agency's ethics rules. These policies and requirements apply to all staff, including IPAs. Formulated a corrective action plan in response to the OIG's recommendations to strengthen and add to existing controls as cited in its June 2017 audit report, NSF Controls to Mitigate IPA Conflicts of I nterest . The report concluded that NSF had \"implemented internal controls to identify and mitigate IPA conflicts of interest.\" Issued a memorandum (OD 17- 03) in March 2017 to all staff, including IPAs, reminding them of the importance of high ethical stan dards. NSF also issued a notice to supervisors in August 2017 FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 43 (OD 17 -17), reminding them of their ethics responsibilities, specifically the responsibility to ensure that all subordinates, including IPAs, comply with the agency's ethics rules. Reviewed and updated core policies relating to IPAs in the NSF Personnel Manual. Developed a required online ethics training module for all new employees, including IPAs. Actions Taken in FY 2018 (a) Conducted analysis (January 2018) on IPA years of service and found that, on average, IPA executives serve 3.1 years at NSF (January 2018) and are 3 times more likely to stay for 3 -4 years compared to staff -level IPAs. Non -executives serve, on average, 2.3 years at NSF. Per OPM, the average time a career SES spends in a p osition is 3.4 years and non- career SES is 1.7 years.2 Engaged with the GAO on an inquiry into the turnover of IPAs. NSF embraces IPA turnover as it helps enable NSF to keep pace with rapidly changing scientific advancements. NSF makes every effort to matc h those changes with a continuous cycle of deep scientific expertise and strong ties to the scientific community. The short -term nature of the rotator tenure allows NSF to continuously renew and align resources to our core mission requirement to promote the progress of science. (b) Delivered the IR/D Annual Report to NSF Deputy Assistant Directors (DADs) (November 2017) indicating, on average, 72% of IPAs participated in IR/D, down from 76% two years ago. On average, IPA IR/D plans requested 37 days of IR/ D, yet only 19 days were used. As of October 2017, active IR/D plans for IPAs totaled $1.36M in dollars requested with an expected actual spend of approximately $680,000. Delivered a \"Benefits of the NSF IR/D Program\" report to the DADs (March 2018), high lighting the value of IR/D in recruitment, research currency , and ethics protection. IPAs participating in IR/D are at the forefront of the research landscape and impact merit review decisions using the latest knowledge, thus having a direct impact on the NSF mission. (c) Extended the Cost -Share Pilot into FY 2018 to continue to evaluate th e effectiveness of the 10% cost-share requirement. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the IPA Cost -Share Pilot that was launched for FY 2017 indicated that there was a cost -share percentage increase from 7.2% in FY 2016 to 7.9% in FY 2017, resulting in an average cost -share increase of almost $5,000 per IPA assignment. Engaged with the GAO on the salary reimbursements associated with IPAs. NSF does not set the salaries for rotators who are detailed to NSF using the IPA authority , as their salaries are set by their home institutions. Submitted to Congress responses to the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 (P.L. 114- 329) (AICA), Section 111 (Personnel Oversight), regarding the Justifications for Rotator Pay Exceeding the SES Pay Max; and Evaluation of the Cost -sharing Pilot (January 2018). (d) Clarified NSF Policy ( Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide ) requiring a substitute negotiator on proposals submitted by former NSF staff, including IPAs, for one year after their departure. Addressed the corrective actions associated with the OIG audit NSF Controls to Mitigate IPA Conflicts of Interest (17- 2- 008). Three of the four recommendations in the corrective action plan have been closed by the OIG. NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge NSF provides the opportunity for scientists, engineers, and educators to rotate into the Foundation as tempora ry Program Directors, advisors, and leaders. Rotators bring fresh perspectives from across the 2https://www.opm.gov/policy -data-oversight/senior -executive-service/facts -figures/#url=Demographics Performance Performance - 44 country and across all fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation, helping influence new directions for research in science, engineering, and education, including emerging interdisciplinary areas. In fact, many of these rotators remain involved in their professional research and development activities while working at NSF through participation in the IR/D program, which is managed by the NSF IR/D Council. NSF takes a proactive approach in the management of the IPA program to appropriately consider and mitigate inherent risks associated with its execution. Demonstrated Top Leadership Commitment: The IPA Steering Committee reports directly to NSF Director France A. C\u00f3rdova and Chief Operating Officer (COO) F. Fleming Crim and has been in place since April 2016. The IPA Steering Committee comprises senior -level leadership across the agency, namely a Chair who is part of the agency's Senior Executi ve Service (SES), the Chairs of the NSF Executive Resources Board (ERB) and IR/D Council, Head of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and four at -large members, including two SES and two executive - level IPAs. The IPA Steering Committee is charged with ensuring NSF is best utilizing the IPA hiring authority. It advises the Foundation's senior leadership on matters that directly concern policy on the use of the IPA program, and on common approaches to budgeting and implementation of the program. It also regularly reports on its oversight and stewardship of the IPA program, including costs associated with the program, to the Director and COO; to OMB; and to Congress, pursuant to the AICA. Capacity: The IPA Steering Committee is supported in the execution of its responsibilities by various NSF units with key expertise for risk management, reporting, and accountability, including BFA, the OIRM Division of Human Resource Management, the Office of General Counsel, the Office of Legislative and Public Affairs, and the Office of Integrative Activities. Corrective Action Plan: With this support, the IPA Steering Committee is pursuing an enterprise risk management approach to identify and understand the potential risks associated with the IPA program, the inheren t impacts and likelihood of these risks, the risk reduction steps being undertaken to address these risks, and the residual risk impacts and likelihood. As part of this approach, and given the management challenges identified by OIG, four risks have been identified: frequent turnover in staff, particularly in senior leadership positions; the time that IPAs spend away from NSF, e.g., as part of their IR/D activities; internal controls associated with IPAs' conflicts of interest; and the costs associated wi th the IPA program. NSF has addressed the corrective action plan associated with the most recent OIG audit on NSF Controls to Mitigate IPA Conflicts of Interest (17 -2-008). Three of the four recommendations in the corrective action plan have been closed by the OIG. NSF has successfully closed all recommendations from previous OIG audits and reviews of the IPA program. Monitoring: Coupled with rigorous data capture, analysis, and sharing across the agency, the IPA Steering Committee is now enabling rigor ous decision making to improve directional oversight for the management of the program. For example, the IPA Steering Committee analyzed the costs of the IPA program, identified potential areas for cost savings, and pursued implementation of these approac hes. Additionally, it led the design and data collection effort for an evaluation of the associated policy implementation, in conjunction with NSF's Evaluation and Assessment Capability within OIA. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 45 Demonstrated Progress: Based on the above, NSF has taken several steps to further strengthen the IPA program. The NSF Director issued a memorandum to all NSF staff, including IPAs, in March 2017 reminding them of the importance of high ethical standards (Staff Memorandum OD 17 -03); and a separate notice to supe rvisors, in August 2017, reminding them of their ethics responsibilities, specifically the responsibility to ensure that their subordinates, including IPAs, comply with agency ethics rules (Staff Memorandum OD 17 -17). Further, the IPA Steering Committee re commended, and NSF adopted, the initiation of a pilot requiring 10% cost - sharing by every IPA's home institution of the IPA's academic- year salary and fringe benefits (per NSF Bulletin 16- 11), which applies to all new IPA agreements initiated in FY 2017, i ncluding those for executive- and program -level staff. NSF has also ended support for lost consulting payments and, in January 2017, published a revised IR/D Guide that includes guidance limiting NSF payment of IPAs' IR/D travel to their home institutions to 12 trips per year. This encourages IPAs to combine other NSF official business and/or telework with these trips to get the most efficient use of those travel dollars. Pending the basis for an evaluation of these changes, particularly the cost -sharing pi lot, NSF extended the pilot through FY 2018. NSF is therefore constantly improving its management of the IPA program and addressing the management challenges identified by the OIG as well as other agency -identified risks and challenges. In this way, NSF is ensuring the program fully supports the mission of the agency and the nation's interests. Indeed, NSF believes that the steps taken to date and described above have reduced the inherent risk substantially, such that the residual risk is acceptable to th e agency. NSF's Anticipated Milestones (a) (b) (c) (d) Deliver the first IPA Program Annual Report to the Director of NSF. This report will provide annual data and trend analyses on various aspects related to the use of IPAs at NSF, for use by the Director and NSF senior managers in assessing and overseeing the program. Develop the CAP in response to the GAO report, \"A Workforce Strategy and Evaluation of Results Could Improve Use of Rotating Scientists, Engineers, and Educators\" (GAO -18-533). Monit or time spent on IR/D by both permanent and rotating staff, and provide data to NSF senior managers to ensure appropriate oversight of IR/D. Develop the year two cost - share pilot evaluation report for submission to the IPA Steering Committee and the Office of the Director. Submit to Congress responses to the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P.L. 114-329) (AICA), Section 111 (Personnel Oversight), regarding the Justifications for Rotator Pay Exceeding the SES Pay Max; and Evaluation of the Cost - share Pilot. Implement an electronic separation clearance process that tracks completion of the OGC ethics exit interviews where separating staff will acknowledge their responsibility for being familiar with post-employment restrictions. Performance Performance - 46 U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) Management Co-Lead s: Assistant Director, GEO, and Office Director, Polar Programs Summary of OIG Identified Challenge (a) (b) (c) (d) Ensure a successful transition from Lockheed Martin to Leidos as the Antarctic Support Contractor (ASC) together with their respective subcontractors by having strong cost controls to protect the government against unwarranted increases in ASC costs during a period of reorganization and mergers. Continue to coordinate with the ASC to soundly manage the acquisition and shipment of Antarctica- bound inventory stored and maintained at Port Hueneme, California; Punta Arenas, Chile; and Christchurch, New Zealand. Ensure modernization of McMurdo Station as it proceeds to construction under the Antarcti c Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project by obtaining the necessary funding from Congress, capitalizing on lessons learned from NSF's large facility work as appropriate, and minimizing the impact that the AIMS planning and construction pro cess will have on Antarctic science. Continue to address misconduct in the Antarctic as set forth in the 2015 OIG Report, Audit of Health and Safety in the U.S. Antarctic Program. NSF's Key Actions to Address the Challenge Agency Actions Taken in Prior Fiscal Years (a) Held routine executive meetings with Lockheed Martin leadership to understand the strategic rationale for the transition to Leidos and the impact to the ASC. Began implementing the novation a greement processed by the Defense Contract Manag ement Agency (DCMA) as the cognizant Federal Agency, which concluded that restructuring was in the best interest of the government. Monitored Leidos' operations on legacy Lockheed Martin systems. The Accounting System, Estimating System, Material Managemen t and Accounting System, Purchasing System, and Property System were approved by DCMA in a letter dated August 25, 2016. (b) Conducted two detailed root cause analyses in response to early fiscal year (FY) 20 17 failures, followed by process improvements. NSF directed the ASC to develop reports on the damaged science equipment and mishandled science samples explaining how and why the damage occurred, and to implement corrective actions to avoid such damage in the future. NSF then approved the action plans and monitored contractor activity for effectiveness. Modified contract policy so that going forward, senior ASC management will be directly involved in all high value -science sample shipments to ensure minimu m risk. Final approval for shipment must come from the senior transportation manager. Ensured that appropriate mitigation for the risk of loss or damage was implemented by November 2016. (c) Continued progress on the 2012 Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) recommen dations, including investment in lifecycle acquisitions and infrastructure upgrades. Addressed major infrastructure upgrades recommended by the BRP report for McMurdo Station through the following design efforts: Completed designs for the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science (AIMS) project, including Core Facility and Utilities packages, and presented the designs to the MREFC Preliminary Design Review (PDR) Panel. Completed designs of the Vehicle Equipment/Operations Center using NSF Re search and Related Activities Funding. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 47 Continued design on the Information Technology & Communications (IT&C) Primary Operations Center, Lodging, and Palmer Pier Replacement Projects. Completed presentation to the National Science Board (NSB), which result ed in the NSB's recommendation that the NSF Director or her designee include the AIMS project in a future budget request. Completed ~ $2M in infrastructure investments in the Black Island Telecommunications Facility to address BRP Recommendation 4.7- 5, Bl ack Island Telecommunications Facility risk management . Issued a Sources Sought Notice on FBO.gov to apprise potential offerors on the AIMS project. Continued internal coordination with LFO in order to leverage institutional knowledge pertaining to previous large facilities work, including best practices and considerations outlined in NSF's Large Facilities Manual (NSF 17 -066). (d) Code of Conduct : Developed a process for reporting and reviewing Code of Conduct violations, which states that each year the Office of Polar Programs will send a request to all USAP employing organizations and NSF's on- site representatives (for grantees) for a report of all significant instances of on ice misconduct for the previous 12 months. This audit action item (#1) regarding the USAP Code of Conduct was formally closed by the OIG on March 28, 2017. Law Enforcement : Oversaw NSF's law enforcement program 's achievement of full compliance with all U.S. Marshals Service requirements for certification and training, and recommendations for law enforcement tools made by the Service. Initiated planning for a future site visit to Antarctica, resources and schedules permitting. OPP had internal conversations with OGC and reached out to law enforcement organization contacts. Breathalyzer Testing : Procured breathalyzer units that do not require calibration. These units provide redundancy for the existing breathalyzer inventory. This audit action sub -item (#4.2) regarding breathalyzer calibration was formally closed by the OIG on 12/22/2015.) Continued to explore the advisability and feasibility of the OIG -recommended requirement for breathalyzer testing for all USAP participants. Consultations with the Department of Justice on policy and legal concerns are being planned. Actions Taken in FY 2018 (a) Monitor ed the transfer of business systems from Lockheed Martin to Leidos. Subsequently, the Leidos DCMA Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer reviewed and approved Leidos business systems. Continued to monitor invoices, Annual Program Plans, business syste m reviews (accounting, estimating, purchasing systems), indirect rates and financial reporting for the USAP contractor to ensure strong cost controls continue with the new entity. (b) Directed NSF's annual assessment of ASC performance, which will identif y cargo failures and contractor responses. Emphasis will be placed on opportunity costs of mishandled science samples and replacement costs of damaged inventory. Penalties will be considered in the contractor award fee. Continued to monitor cargo shipments during the August 2017 - February 2018 cycle. Conducted weekly NSF -led meetings with the prime contractor focused on protecting government property. Performance Performance - 48 (c) Authorized additional design to advance the AIMS design beyond bridging documents (35%). Initiate d and completed necessary initial solicitation efforts for individual AIMS components. Completed designs for and awarded IT&C Primary Addition for construction. Initiated acquisition of major components of the Ross Island Satellite communications Earth Station (RIES) to address Black Island Telecom Facility deficiencies. Prepared for AIMS Final Design Review (FDR), anticipated in Q1 of FY 2019. Continued to update the long- range capital plan to include lifecycle and real property investments for all Anta rctic locations. (d) Code of Conduct : Continued to implement NSF process for reporting and reviewing Code of Conduct violations. Updated Code of Conduct to clarify to the community the consequences (e.g., potential removal) of misconduct in Antarctica. Law Enforcement : Reviewed the final report dated March 12, 2018 of a group of law enforcement officials who had conducted an on- site evaluation in February 2018. The Law Enforcement Review and Site- Visit assess ed equipment and training for special deputies and reviewed other areas, such as legal jurisdiction, USAP law enforcement staffing, facilities, communications with the U.S. Marshals Service, and detainment and transportation of suspects. The report contains recommendations and suggestions. This audit action item (#3) regarding USAP Law Enforcement was formally closed by the OIG on June 12, 2018. Breathalyzer Testing : Finalized a memo detailing the results of NSF exploration of the advisability and feasibility of implementing a requirement for breathalyzer testing for all USAP participants. NSF determined that since USAP supporting organizations have their own breathalyzer testing programs, the benefit of establishing and enforcing an NSF -managed breathalyzer program would not be worth the legal, contractual and fi nancial obligations. NSF decided to accept the risk of not implementing its own breathalyzer program. This audit action sub -item (#4.1) regarding the legality of requiring breathalyzer testing for all USAP participants was formally closed by the OIG on 02 /05/2018.) NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge NSF\u2014through the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) in the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) \u2014funds and manages the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP). The USAP supports United States' research and national policy goals in the Antarctic. The inherent risks associated with Antarctica's remote location, extreme environment, and the short period of time during which the continent is accessible has precipitated several actions under the USAP management challenge fo r NSF. These actions include: a) ensuring a successful transition from Lockheed Martin to Leidos as the Antarctic Support Contractor (ASC) while preventing unwarranted increases in cost; b) ensuring sound management of the acquisition and shipment of Antarctica- bound property and inventory stored and maintained at three ports \u2014Port Hueneme, California, Punta Arenas, Chile, and Christchurch, New Zealand; c) ensuring modernization of McMurdo Station as it proceeds to construction under the Antarctic Infrastr ucture Modernization for Science (AIMS) project; and d) continuing to address misconduct in the Antarctic, including items noted in the 2015 OIG Report, Audit of Health and Safety in the U.S. Antarctic Program . Through leadership commitments, dedication o f staff and resources, corrective action planning, and monitoring implementation of plans, NSF has demonstrated significant progress in reducing the inherent risk to residual risk levels for USAP management that are well within acceptable ranges. The transition of FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 49 the ASC responsibilities to Leidos has occurred without disruptions in operations or unwarranted increases in cost. Management controls and operating procedures for monitoring invoice processing and systems performance are in place. Efforts are underway to evaluate an automated process to review invoices and identify inaccuracies. NSF performed root cause analyses of issues pertaining to the shipment and storage of property and inventory, and consequently developed and implemented process improv ements. Routine NSF-led meetings are held with Leidos to emphasize prime contractor responsibilities to protect government property. Planning and implementation of the modernization of McMurdo Station and other large facilities work in Antarctica are und erway with cognizance by the National Science Board (NSB), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Congress. Plans going forward include engaging the scientific community in efforts to minimize disruption that the AIMS planning and construction pro cess might have on Antarctic science. NSF has dedicated staff with primary responsibility of stewardship for the long -range capital plan, to include lifecycle and real property investments for all Antarctic locations. All 2015 OIG misconduct -related acti on items, as expressed in the Audit of Health and Safety in the U.S. Antarctic Program , were closed by the OIG. NSF and USAP efforts have been positive steps and continuing efforts will help ensure USAP is well poised to address misconduct in the future. NSF's Anticipated Milestones (a) (b) (c) (d) Continue to apply invoice processing in accordance with the current NSF \"Guidance and Instructions for Invoice Review and Processing\" SOP. Evaluate an automated process to review invoices and identify inaccuracies. Monitor cargo during the upcoming shipment cycle (August 2018 - February 2019). Continue to conduct weekly NSF-led meetings with the prime contractor focused on protecting government property. Complete necessary solicitation efforts for AIMS project. Conduct AIMS Final Design Review (FDR) in Q1 of FY 2019. Engage the scientific community in efforts to minimize disruption that the AIMS planning and construction process might have on Antarctic science. Advance the long -range capital plan to in clude lifecycle and real property investments for all Antarctic locations. Code of Conduct : Continue to implement its process for reporting and reviewing Code of Conduct violations. Continue to update the Code of Conduct as circumstances require d. Law En forcement : Implement appropriate changes in response to the Federal Law Enforcement S ite Visit Report. Performance Performance - 50 Cybersecurity and IT Management Lead: Chief Information Officer Summary of OIG Identified Challenge (a) (b) (c) System Monitoring : Protect information systems against unauthorized access or modification to decrease the risk of unauthorized transactions and unauthorized changes to data, audit logs, and configurations that remain undetected and affect the integrity of financial transactions.

Mobile Devices : Develop effective measures to preserve social media messag es, capture text messages on NSF-owned devices, and monitor downloads of smartphone applications to ensure compliance with Federal requirements and guidance for electronic records management. NSF's Key Actions to Address the Challenge Agency Actions Tak en in Prior Fiscal Years (a) (b) (c) Continu ed monitoring activities to compl y with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and ensured ongoing operational security throughout the system lifecycle. Implemented numerous risk mitigating actions in FY 2017 to address the O IG's management challenges. Established configuration baselines for productions systems and implemented the D epartment of Homeland S ecurity Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program Phase I with more frequent c onfiguration scans. Documented user administration processes for the Award System and webTA. Adjusted the USAP security plan review and updated process to provide earlier updates to validate controls being in place for the year. Implemented a mobile dev ice management (MDM) capability to enforce configuration management and ensure the integrity of agency information. Actions Taken in FY 2018 (a) (b) (c) Established technical controls to monitor the NSF network for unauthorized access to reduce the risk of unauthorized transactions, changes to data, audit logs and configurations. Conducted configuration scans and regular reviews of audit logs and reported results to management. Proactively assessed the security state of systems through NSF's IT security continuous monitoring program . Allocated appropriate resources to the USAP IT security program to address FISMA findings. Completed security plan updates and a business impact analysis to address recovery priorities. Updated and issued guidance related to the use of smartphone applications that support encryption and/or automatically delete messages. Implemented controls in May 2018 that prohibit applications identified as violating NSF policy from being downloaded onto NSF -issued mobile devices. Prohibited applications that support encrypted communication unless their use is approved by the OGC and NSF Records Officer p er federal guidance . Implemented quarterly monitoring of applications . FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 51 NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge The availability of information technology (IT) resources and security posture of its IT systems is vital to NSF's ability to carry out its mission. The agency's Chief Information Offi cer is part of the Office of the Director and oversees the Foundation's proactive IT security management structure that takes a risk -based approach and provides timely and relevant information to stakeholders. The agency has assessed the risks in the three areas set forth in the OIG Management Challenge for Cybersecurity and Information Technology Management and is confident that overall the residual risks remaining are low. As of July 2018, NSF analyzed the root causes, e.g. people, process and tools, and agency staff implemented solutions to address the three challenges noted above. NSF senior management established and committed to a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) as a performance measure to monitor corrective action progress. The POA&M incorporat es the IG Management Challenges for systems monitoring, USAP IT security, and mobile devices. The POA&M is updated quarterly, and a progress report is distributed to senior management for review. Systems Monitoring. NSF established a system -wide audit log review process by implementing procedures and tools to monitor the system and report results to senior management on a regular basis. While NSF acknowledges the potential impact of unauthorized activity on agency systems, based on these actions and the ab ove described evaluation of this risk, causes and outcomes, NSF is confident that the remaining residual risk is low. USAP IT Security. The Office of Polar Programs (OPP), U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) Section for Antarctic Infrastructure and Logistics (G EO/OPP/AIL) prioritized IT security initiatives and committed resources to address FISMA findings. Specifically, GEO/OPP/AIL conducted a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to identify mission and business processes, prioritize the processes, and determine the impact on the processes if systems are unavailable. The OPP BIA identifies important functional relationships and interdependencies, as well as time sensitivities that impact the USAP mission. OPP implemented the National Institute of Standards and Technol ogy Risk Management Framework to enable GEO/OPP/AIL to prepare, execute, and communicate in keeping with cybersecurity risk management best practices. OPP's risk-based approach to cybersecurity is supported by operational activities, regular program review s and management reporting that support risk decisions and risk mitigation actions. Through improved oversight and resource allocation to priority tasks, OPP continues to manage the residual risk for USAP information systems. Monitoring and reporting pr ocesses communicate cybersecurity risk to senior management to assess risk and determine appropriate courses of action consistent with organizational risk tolerance. The IT security program is evaluated in accordance with the FISMA. NSF is proactive in rev iewing security controls and identifying areas to improve the IT security program and incorporates information gained and lessons learned to strengthen NSF's cybersecurity posture. NSF's adaptive risk management is very responsive to a changing cybersecur ity environment with low residual risk. Mobile Devices . In addition to ensuring the availability and strong security posture of agency IT systems, NSF recognizes the importance of protecting the integrity of information on, and appropriate use of, NSF - issued mobile devices. Part of this responsibility is ensuring that information on agency mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, is captured and retained per Federal recordkeeping requirements. NSF's mobile device management capability enforces co nfiguration requirements on mobile devices that access NSF email, contacts, and calendars, and provides mechanisms to ensure compromised devices are disconnected from agency systems so information is not lost. Additionally, NSF has implemented new procedur es and controls which allow specific applications to be blacklisted, preventing their use on NSF - issued mobile devices. NSF has blacklisted two mobile applications that support encryption and/or the ability to automatically delete messages after they are r ead or sent, which could be used to circumvent Performance Performance - 52 agency recordkeeping systems. NSF is monitoring installed applications on agency- issued mobile devices each quarter to identify if there are new applications that should be restricted from use. Furthermore, NS F continues to research alternatives for the automatic capture and retention of text messages on NSF -issued mobile devices and plans to have this capability in place by November 2018. In addition to the technical controls previously described, NSF conti nues to educate mobile device users on their responsibilities for ensuring the capture and retention of information mobile devices per Federal records management guidance. In May 2018, the Foundation published a revised NSF Bulletin related to the assignment and use of agency mobile devices, including more detailed information on protecting and preserving agency information. The May 2018 NSF Bulletin revision updated the rules of behavior outlining responsibilities for individuals with NSF -issued mobile dev ices. With recent and planned actions related to NSF's mobile device services program, comprising technology controls and policy guidance, there is low residual risk of loss for electronic records requiring capture and retention. NSF continues to evaluate its mobile device services program offerings to focus on the intersection between users and technologies, with the goal of protecting agency information against loss or disclosure. NSF's Anticipated Milestones (a) (b) (c) Employ capabilities to further strengthen the cybersecurity program and implement application event monitoring tools and audit log reviews to detect potential unauthorized changes to financially significant data or configuration changes that affect NSF's security process. Maintain OPP o perational IT security awareness, review program priorities , and allocate resources to ensure IT security program infrastructure and staffing requirements are adequate. Ensure OPP's NextGen project addresses IT infrastructure upgrades. Continue to research alternatives for the automatic capture and retention of text messages on NSF - issued mobile devices and plans to implement this capability by November 2018. Continue to evaluate additional enhancements to NSF mobile device services program, including new capabilities to preserve information and ensure the retention of agency electronic messaging and information per federal guidance. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 53 Encouraging the Ethical Conduct of Research Lead: Chief Operating Off icer Summary of OIG Identified Challenge (a) (b) (c) It is essential that NSF continue to recognize the importance of its Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) requirement. It is important to emphasize research integrity as a core value. NSF awardees could benefit from NSF providing written guidelines or templates for universities to follow. NSF has an opportunity to encourage incorporation of best practices into RCR programs. NSF should encourage institutions to extend their RCR programs to faculty. NSF's Key Actions to Address the Challenge Agency Actions Taken in Prior Fiscal Years Issued Important Notice No. 140, Training in Responsible Conduct of Research - A Reminder of the NSF Requirement from the NSF Director on August 17, 2017. Actions Taken in FY 2018 (a) Evaluated themes and common threads of research misconduct cases and used the analysis to draft additional guidance for the FY 2019 Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG) on the definition and consequences of research misconduct and on NSF -funded resources available for RCR training . Revised Cultivating Cultures for Ethical STEM (CCE STEM) program solicit ation to incorporate specific references to RCR training and online resources to assist with RCR training. Sponsored an SBE special lecture at NSF, \"Fighting against Doubt and Promoting Public Trust in Research Practices\", presented by Kristen Intemann. Emphasized integrity as a core value in the NSF strategic plan, Building the Future: Investing in Discovery and Innovation, by specifically stating that \"We hold each other and our awardees to the highest standards of ethical behavior. We strive to ensure the trustworthiness of the results of NSF-funded research by promoting the responsible conduct of research.\" Included RCR requirement in NSF outreach at the NSF Grants Conference and other outreach events. (b) Incorporated a reference to Chapters 9 (\"Id entifying and Promoting Best Practices for Research Integrity\") and 10 (\"Education for the Responsible Conduct of Research\") of Fostering Integrity in Research (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017) (NASEM Report) into the draft PAPPG scheduled for publication in October 2018. Encouraged awardees to incorporate promising RCR practices by initiating outreach regarding proposed PAPPG changes. Revised the CCE STEM program solicitation to incorporate the Fostering Integrity in Research conclusion that \"training for responsible conduct of research is most effective when it is part of a comprehensive approach to enhance an organization's research enterprise.\" Synthesized a set of findings regarding best ethical research practices based o n reports from three of the ethics workshops NSF funded over the past three years. Held meeting with CCE STEM PIs to review synthesized workshop findings and receive input on dissemination plans. (c) Produced a set of slides on RCR and research misconduct for use in NSF staff outreach to the research community, suggesting that STEM faculty incorporate RCR into their mentoring, teaching, and curriculum development. Held NSF senior management briefings about the importance of involving PIs and Co- PIs in the RCR requirement. Performance Performance - 54 Drafted guidance language for the FY 2020 PAPPG: \" NSF encourages training of faculty in the responsible and ethical conduct of research. \" NSF Management's Overview of the Challenge NSF leadership emphasizes that NSF does not tolerate research misconduct, which means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing or performing research funded by NSF, in reviewing research proposals submitted to NSF, or in reporting research re sults funded by NSF. The OIG investigates allegations of research misconduct and makes recommendations to NSF for disposition. NSF's Chief Operating Officer decides on disposition of the referrals for research misconduct based on input from staff in the O ffice of General Counsel, the Office of Integrative Activities, and the Office of the Director. In 2017, the NSF Director issued an Important Notice reminding NSF awardees of the NSF requirement for training in responsible conduct of research, and NSF's st rategic plan for FY2018- 2022 emphasizes integrity as a core value. As reported by the OIG in its Spring 2017 Semiannual Report, the number of research misconduct referrals to NSF from FY 2005 through FY 2017 has remained relatively low and has not trended upward. NSF also performed a more detailed root cause analysis of referrals to the agency by the OIG in FY 2016 and FY 2017. In this 2- year period, NSF made 23 findings of research misconduct based on 24 referrals (excluding referrals arising from the Smal l Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer programs). Nine of the findings arose from plagiarism by faculty in proposals to NSF that were not funded. Considering that the total number of referrals by the OIG is relatively low and NSF reviewed over 98,000 proposals and funded over 23,000 proposals in the same period, it is difficult to identify trends. However, NSF notes that a significant subset of findings involve plagiarism by faculty in unfunded proposals. NSF is addressing these issues through additional guidance and outreach. NSF will continue to track and analyze the OIG's investigation referrals to assess responsive actions and identify new trends. NSF recognizes the potential high impact of research misconduct and has taken ac tions to reduce the likelihood of such activities. NSF's Anticipated Milestones (a) (b) (c) Publish the 2019 PAPPG with the additional language on the definition and consequences of research misconduct and on the NSF -funded resources available for RCR training. Continue to fund the Online Ethics Center and research on best practices. Incorporate workshop findings into the Online Ethics Center. Hold a \"promising practices summit\" conference with examples of effective RCR approaches. Publish revised PAPPG incorporating a reference to Chapters 9 (\"Identifying and Promoting Best Practices for Research Integrity\") and 10 (\"Education for the Responsible Conduct of Research\") of the NASEM report. Continue to encourage awardees to incorporate promising RCR pract ices by initiating outreach regarding new PAPPG changes. Use the new outreach materials for encouraging faculty to participate in RCR training and demonstrate best practices. Encourage STEM faculty to incorporate RCR in their mentoring, teaching, and curriculum development. FY 2020 NSF Budget Request to Congress Performance - 55 OTHER INFORMATION Management Reviews Each quarter, NSF senior leadership reviews progress towards all performance goals of the agency in a data-driven review meeting led by the Chief Operating Officer and Performance Improvement Officer. The quarterly progress of the Agency Priority Goals (AP Gs) and performance goals are reviewed. Alignment of Human Capital Efforts with Organizational Performance In order to drive individual and organizational performance, NSF requires that the performance plans of all employees, executives, and the general workforce contain individual goals aligned with the agency's mission and strategic goals. NSF provides training and makes tools and templates available for all supervisors and employees on linking performance plans to agency mission, as well as providing assistance and training on the policies, processes, requirements, and timeframes for the development of performance plans and appraisals. NSF also directly aligns its strategic human capital and accountability efforts to the agency goals identified in the NSF Strategic Plan. Agency performance goals currently outline specific human capital goals, and NSF uses HRStat as the agency reporting mechanism to articulate the nexus between NSF's strategic goals/objectives, including agency performance goals, and human capital initiatives at the agency. Senior leaders are briefed quarterly regarding the status of agency performance goals and the human capital initiatives aligned to those goals. Strategies and Collaborations No one standard strategy is used across NSF for achievement of goals. Goal leaders at NSF choose strategies tailored to their stakeholders' needs and their institutional capabilities. NSF goals often involve testing the impacts of new activities or new approaches to existing activities, so feedb ack mechanisms are built in. Use of analysis, evidence, and evaluation findings is also at the discretion of each individual goal leader, as is the decision to collaborate with other agencies or external entities or to invest in contract support for their activities. Performance at NSF is reviewed quarterly by NSF's Performance Improvement Officer, who reports on goal progress to NSF senior management. Advisory Committees and Committees of Visitors Each directorate and office has an external advisory com mittee that typically meets twice a year to review and provide advice on program management, discuss current issues, and review and provide advice on the impact of policies, programs, and activities in the disciplines and fields encompassed by the director ate or office. In addition to directorate and office advisory committees, NSF is also advised by external committees on specific topics. Recent examples include : astronomy and astrophysics; environmental research and education; equal opportunities in science and engineering; direction, development, and enhancements of innovations; polar programs; advanced cyberinfrastructure; international and integrative activities; the agency's merit review processes; and business and operations. Committees of Visitors (COVs) are subcommittees of NSF directorate advisory committees. COV reviews provide NSF with external expert judgments in two areas: (1) assessments of the quality and integrity of program operations and program -level technical and managerial matters pertaining to proposal decisions; and (2) comments on how the outputs and outcomes generated by awardees have contributed to the attainment of NSF's mission and strategic outcome goals. COV reviews are conducted at regular intervals of approximately four years for programs and offices that recommend or award grants, cooperative Performance Performance - 56 agreements, and/or contracts and whose main focus is the conduct or support of NSF research and education in science and engineering. Approximately one -fourth of NSF's divisions are assessed each year. A COV typically consists of up to 20 external experts, selected to ensure independence, programmatic coverage, and geographic balance. COV members come from academia, industry, government, and the public sector. They meet for two or three days to review and assess program priorities, program management, and award accomplishments or outcomes. Each COV prepares a report and the division or program that is being reviewed must prepare a response to the COV recommendations . These reports and responses are submitted to the parent advisory committee and to the Director of NSF. All reports and responses are public and posted on NSF's website. 1 In FY 2018, five directorates or offices convened nine COVs, covering all or part o f seven divisions and one office . A table of the COVs performed in recent years and planned through FY 2020 is provided on the next page. The chapters of the directorates also contain information on these COVs, as well as information on ad hoc reports . Evaluations and Research Evaluations at NSF are currently performed at the discretion of the individual directorate, office, or program being evaluated. A list of the evaluations completed in FY 2018 follows. For more details about how the results of thes e specific evaluations are being used to shape agency decisions, see the chapter of the sponsoring directorate. Directorate chapters also contain a list of selected high -impact events (workshops, symposia, or other meetings resulting in publications) that inform their decision -making.

The guidance from GAO indicates that agencies should \"...describe the means the agency will use to verify its performan ce data...\" and \"...provide confidence that [their] performance information be credible.\"2 In FY 2018, NSF contracted with Nexight Group to perform the independent verification and validation. Nexight assessed the validity of NSF data and verif ied the reliability of the methods used to collect, process, maintain, and report that data. Nexight's FY 2018 report concluded: The Nexight Team was able to verify the reliability of the processes used to generate the performance measure results for seven performance goals. Although some of the measures have issues that should be addressed in future years, the data collection processes for all measures adhere to the five V&V criteria \u2014Complete, Consistent, Accurate, Timely, and Valid \u2014and are sufficient to ensure that the results are usable. The Nexight Team was also able to confirm the reported results for most of the performance measures under the seven goals. Overall, the Nexight Team verifies that NSF relies on sound data collection practices, internal con trols, and manual checks of system queries to ensure accurate performance reporting. Based on the V&V assessment, the Nexight Team has confidence in the systems, policies, and procedures used by NSF to calculate results for its performance measures. NSF co ntinues to take concerted steps to improve the quality of its systems and data. The Nexight Team confirms NSF's commitment to ensuring the accuracy of its reported Government Performance and Results Act ( GPRA) results, and the reliability of its processes for collecting, processing, maintaining, and reporting data for its performance goals . 3 The data and information required to measure progress towards NSF's performance goals fall into three broad categories. 1. NSF automated administrative systems. Performance monitoring can be a valuable secondary function of such systems. Reporting can include data from systems that: Store and approve publications such as solicitations announcements, and Dear Colleague Letters; Collect transactional data about proposal and award management; Perform financial transactions; Store human resources data; or Permit keyword search of abstract or full texts of proposals and awards. The data were used either directly or for achieving milestones that involve the writing of a report. While not all goals require a high level of accuracy, data from these systems are highly reliable. 2. Data requests of external parties. Qualitative or quantitative information is solicited directly from awarde es. 2 GAO, The Results Act: An Evaluator's Guide to Assessing Agency Annual Performance Plans, GAO/GGD-10.1.20 (Washington, D.C.: April 1998), pp. 40-41. 3 Nexight Group with Energetics Incorporated, National Science Foundation Performance Measurement Verificat ion and Validation Report, Fiscal Year 2018 .

GAO NumberTitle (Final Audit Report Date) GAO RecommendationStatus of Recommendation Timeline for Final Implementation GAO-16-511 Information Technology Agencies Need to Improve Their Application Inventories to Achieve Additional Savings (09/29/2016)Recommendation 17: To improve federal agencies' efforts to rationalize their portfolio of applications, the Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, the Interior, and Labor; and the Director of the National Science Foundation should direct the CIOs and other responsible officials to modify existing investment management processes to address applications more completely. Specifically, the Director of the National Science Foundation should direct the CIO to consistently document evaluations for all applications and report cost information for them in the roadmap or other documentation.Open The NSF has implemented this recommendation. In March 2019 the Foundation sent documentation to GAO that demonstrated that a small number of applications had been accounted for in the rationalization process. Closure of the recommendation is pending GAO review. GAO-16-573 Federal Research Grants: Opportunities Remain for Agencies to Streamline Administrative Requirements (06/22/2016)Recommendation 9: To further standardize administrative research requirements, the Secretary of Energy, the NASA Administrator, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Director of NSF should coordinate through Office of Science and Technology Policy's (OSTP) Research Business Models working group to identify additional areas where they can standardize requirements and report on these efforts.Open The NSF participates in the Research Business Models (RBM) working group. The working group is finalizing the 2019 RBM Report to Congress on reducing Federal administrative and regulatory pre-award burden on extramural researchers. Once the report is complete, the RBM and its participating agencies will establish priorities for the future and continue to make advances in standardizing requirements among research agencies.

In November 2018, NSF provided GAO with supporting documentation. Closure of the recommendation is pending GAO review. GAO-12-791 Organizational Transformation: Enterprise Architecture Value Needs to Be Measured and Reported (09/26/2012)Recommendation 45: To enhance federal agencies' ability to realize enterprise architecture benefits, the Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture, the Air Force, the Army, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, the Interior, Labor, the Navy, State, Transportation, the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs; the Attorney General; the Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Small Business Administration; the Commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Social Security Administration; and the Directors of the National Science Foundation and the Office of Personnel Management should periodically measure and report enterprise architecture outcomes and benefits to top agency officials (i.e., executives with authority to commit resources or make changes to the program) and to OMB.Open The NSF has implemented this recommendation. In November 2018, the Foundation provided evidence to GAO that it periodically measures and reports Enterprise Architecture outcomes to top agency officials. Closure of the recommendation is pending GAO review.
