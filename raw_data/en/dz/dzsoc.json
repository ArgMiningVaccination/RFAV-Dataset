The intent of the law is to impose regulation on occupation s and professions only when it is necess ary to protect the public heal th, safety or welfare. DORA must prepare a report ev aluating the justificat ion for regulation bas ed upon th e criteria c ontained in the sunrise statute: (I) Whether the unregulated pr actice of the occupa tion or profession clearly harms or endangers t he health, safety, or welfare of t he pub lic, and whether the potential for the harm is eas ily recognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument; (II) Whether the public needs, and can reasonably be expected to benefit from, an assurance of initial and continuing pr ofessional or occupat ional competence; and (III) Whether the public can be adequately protected by other means in a m ore cost-effecti ve manner. Any professional or occupatio nal group or organization, an y indiv idual, or any other interested party may submit an application for t he regulation of an unregulated occupat ion or profession. Applications must be accompanied by supporting signatures and must include a description of the proposed regulat ion and justification for such regulation. Applica tions received by July 1 must have a review comp leted by DORA by October 15 of the y ear following the year of submission. MMeetthhooddoollooggyy DORA has completed its evaluatio n of the proposal for regulatio n of naturopathic physicians. During the sunrise review proc ess, DORA performed a literature search, contacted and interviewed the applic ant, reviewed licens ure laws in other states, conducted interviews of administrators of those program s, and interviewed other groups of healthcare practitioners. DORA attended a meeting between the Colora do Medical Society and the Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Also, DORA facilitated a meeting bet ween proponents and opponents of regulation. I n order to det ermine the number and types of complaints filed against naturopat hs in Color ado, DORA contacted the Offic e of the Attorney General, and the Colorado Board of Medical Examiners. 1 PPrrooppoossaall ffoorr RReegguullaattiioonn The Colorado Assoc iation of Nat uropathic Ph ysicians (Applicant ) has submitted a sunrise application to the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) fo r review in a ccordance with the provisions of s ection 24-34-104.1, Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S.). This occupational group is known as Doctors of Naturopathy, N.D., nat uropaths, naturopathic practitioners, naturopathic phys icians, Doct ors of Naturopathic Medicine, and Naturopathic Medical Doctors. The Applic ant proposes a stat e licensure program for natur opathic physic ians that would define a sc ope of practice, establish clear titl es that the public understands , and allow for discipline of practitioners. The Applicant seeks regulation in or der to enable the pu blic to clearly differentiate between the various m ember s of the naturopathic pr ofession in regards to training and qualifications, and to allow nat uropathic physicians a scope of practice and authorization to practi ce. The Applic ant further argues t hat Colorado needs regulation of naturopathic physicians for the following reasons: The public should not be required to beco me experts in medical educ ation and detection of false credentials in order to access health care. Regulation should provide c lear avenues for public complaint, a f unctional disciplinary process by whic h the public c an register complaints, allo w th e state to control inappropriate practice, and ensure that pr actitioners are afforded due process. The following components would characteri ze the recommended licensure program: Program administered by the Division of Registrations located within DORA. Establishm ent of minimum education st andards, including a degree from a naturopathic medical college accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Passing sc ores Defined 2 The Applic ant previously subm itted sunrise applications in 1993 and 1998. Comparable to the current application, the pr evious applications propos ed a licens ure progr am that required a degree from a CNME-accredit ed naturopathic medi cal college and succ essful passage of the NPLEX. The 1993 sunrise review conc luded that the Applica nt had not shown that the public was being s ubstantially harmed by t he unregulated practice of naturopathic physicians. In addition, the number of naturopathic physicians in Colorado c omprised s uch a small number (20) that a regulatory program would place an unreasonable burden on practitioners because the licensing fee would have been approximately $1,500 per year. Although t he sunris e review c onducted in 1993 recom mended again st regulation, a bill for full regulat ion and lic ensure of naturopathic physicians was int roduced in the General Assembly. The 1998 sunrise rev iew deli neated the benefits of regulation and discuss ed the pot ential public conf usion regarding the e ducation and training of pers ons in Colorado who ref er to themselves as naturopathic physicians, naturopathic medical doctors, Doctors of Naturopathy, and N.D. Furthermore, the 1998 sunris e review maintained that if the General Assembly determined that regul ation of naturopathy was warra nted, two regulatory models (title protection and lic ensure) would be reas onable to consider. PPrrooffiillee ooff tthhee PPrrooffeessssiioonn Historical Perspective Naturopathy is a system of health care bas ed on the philosophy t hat the human body has the power to heal it self by restoring its natural balance. Natur opathy encompasses an evolving sy stem that includes hy medicines, psy chology, physiotherapy , and spi nal manipulation. Natural medicine grew out of the alternative healing sys tems of the 18th and 19th centuries, but traces its philosophical r oots to the Hippocratic school of medicine (circa 400 B.C.). Naturopathic medicine has been practiced in the United States and in Europe throughout history. Conventiona l medicine and natur opathy were at one time quite similar in their use of medicinal plants, diet therapi es, and hydrotherapy treatments. Only within the last 40-50 years has conventional medicine diverged from this path. The naturopathic prof ession has a 100-year hi story in North Am erica. Naturopathy ev olved in the late 19th century from the work of Dr. Benjamin Lus t, a German physician who came to the Unit ed States in 1892 to spread the prac tice of hydrotherapy. Naturopathy grew to include all natural methods of healing, including the use of botanical medic ines, homeopathy, nutritional therapy, and manipulativ e therapies. T he term \"naturopathy\" was coined for this evolv ing system o f natural th erapies in 1895 by Dr. J ohn Scheel of New York City, to describe his method of health care. 3 Naturopathic medicine was popular and widely av ailable throughout the U.S. well int o the early part of the 20th century. Around 1920, from coast to coast, there were a num ber of naturopathic medical schools, th ousands of naturopathic phys icians, and a large number of patients using naturopathic therapies. Naturopathic medic ine went in to decline, along with most other natural health professions, after the 1930s. Dr. Benjamin Lust's death, conflict between various sc hools of natural medicine ( homeopathy, Eclectic s, Physio-Medi calism, herbalis m, naturopathic medicine, and others.), the rise of medi cal technology, and the use of \"miracle drugs\" like antib iotics were all contributing factors. By the 1970s, however, the American publ ic was inspired to look for \"new\" options and alternatives to conventional medic ine. Naturopathy and all of complementary alternative medicine began to enter a new era of rejuvenation. 1 The Naturopathic Phy sician In states that regulate naturopathic physicians, they function as primary care physicians and have attended four-year graduate le vel naturopathic medical sc hools. They study holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on diseas e preventio n and optimizing wellness. Naturopat hic phys icians encourage the s elf-healing abilities of the individual t hrough the education and prom otion of therapeutic me thods and modalities.2 Their training with respect to modalities includes a f ocus on nu trition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, physical manipulation, phar macology, and minor surgery. Some naturopathic physicians have additi onal training in natural chil dbirth and/or acupuncture. The American Association of Naturopathic Ph ysicians defines naturopat hic medicine as \"a distinct system of primary health care - an art, science, philos ophy and practice of diagnosis, treatment, and preven tion of illne ss.\" 3 The practic e of naturopathy is based on the philosophy that can be summarized as: \"helping the body heal itself in the least invasive, most fundamentally cur ative manner possible. This approach is not tied to any particular therapy or modality, but rather is oriented to a rational blend of vit alistic and mechanistic principles working with the whole person, and educat ing the patient in the ways of health.\"4 1 University of Marylan d acce ssed Jul y 19, 2005. 2 Holly J. Hou gh et al., Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Prac tice. San Fran cisco: Ce nter for the Health Professio ns, University of California, 20 01. 3 The Ameri 12, 2004. 44 Rand all Brad ley, N.D., Philoso phy of Na turopathi c Me dicine. Pizzo rno: Murray & Bradley, 198 5. There are six princ iples that naturopathic physicians c onsider to be fundam ental in def ining naturopathic medicine. They are: 1. The Healing Power of Nature: Naturopathic medicine recogniz es an inherent healing process in the person that is ordered and intelligent . The body is capable of healin g itself. The r ole of the naturopathic physician is to id entify and remove obstacles to hea ling and recove ry and to fa cilitate an d augment this inherent natural tendency of the body. 2. Identify and Tr eat the Cause: Naturopathic phys icians seek to identify and re move the underlying ca uses of illness, not merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. 3. First Do No Harm: Naturopathic physicians follow three gui delines to avoid harming patients: 1. Utilize methods a nd medic inal substances that mini mize risk s of side effects, using the least force n eeded to diagnose and treat. 2. Avoid, when possible, the har mful suppression of symptoms. 3. Acknowledge and work with the indi vidual's self-healing process. 4. Doctor as Teacher: Naturopathic physic ians recall that the origin of the word \"doctor\" is the Latin word, \"to teach.\" A fundamental emphasis in naturopa thic medicine is patient education. 5. Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic phys icians attempt to take into cons ideration al l the factors that make up patients' liv es and affect their health and well-being. 6. Prevention: Naturopathic medicine emphasizes the prevention of disease, assesses risk factors, and makes appropriate interventions with patient s to prevent illness. Naturopathic physicians believ e that health resu lts from the harmonious functioning of all parts of a person. Therapy is directed at the whole person and at the underlying ca use of illness, such as the patient's lifesty le, diet habits, and emotional state. Naturopaths take a holistic approach to heal ing. I n diagnos ing ailments, naturopathic physicians take medical histories, order labor atory tests, and perform physical examinations . Treatment methods include nutri tional adv ice, the use of hom eopathic remedies, herbs and botanical medicines, vitami n and mineral t herapy, physi otherapy, hydrotherapy, psychological couns eling, stress management, and sp inal manipulation. In regard to spinal manipulation, natur opathic physicians differ from chiroprac tors in that chiropractors may specialize in one therapeutic approach while natur opathic practic e usually includes a broad range of drugless therapies. 5 One treatment method, homeopat hy, bas ed on the principle that \"like c ures like,\" is a treatment i n whic h the patient receives tiny dosages of natural substances that in larger dosages would cause the same symptoms as the ailment. It is based upon the obser ved relationsh ip between a remedy's ability to produce signs and symptoms in a healthy individual and the same remedy's ability to cure a sick patient with similar signs and symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are derived from a wide vari ety of plant, mineral, and chemical s ubstances. The 1938 Federal Food, Dr ug, and Cosmetic Act gave legal status to homeopathic remedies. These remedies are recognized as drugs in the Homeopathi c Phar macopoeia of the United States . Homeopat hic remedies are available from practitioners, pharmacists, and heal th food stores, as well as ma nufacturers who sell directly to the public. Hydrotherapy, another method of treatment used by naturopathi c physicians, is defined as the use of water in any of its forms for the maintenance of healt h or the treatment of disease. Water at various temperatures is used for therapeutic purposes. For example, the physiother apy departments of many hospitals hav e heated hydr otherapy p ools for treatment. Alternate treatments with hot a nd cold water are used to stim ulate the circulation of the blood. Nat uropathic physicians may also re commend hydrotherapy for its revitalizing properties during convalescenc e. Education and Training All naturopathic medical coll ege programs are residential (s tudents attend classes and laboratories in person) and hav e four-year academic programs. The U.S. Department of Education (U.S. DOE ) recognizes the Council on Naturopathic Medica l Education (CNME) as the programmatic accrediting agency for the residential naturopathic medical colleges. The CNME requires four years of graduate level study in medical sc iences and naturopathic therapeutic s. The CNME received federal recognition from t he U.S. DOE in 1987 and acted as the institutional accr editing agency for naturopathic programs fo r the next 13 years. In 1999, the U.S. DO E staff and the National Advisor y Commi ttee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) requested that CNME's application for renewal of recognition be denied. The recommendation was bas ed on ev idence that CNME did not res pond appropriately to violations of its standards at Southwest Colle ge of Naturopathic Medicine (SCNM). Between 1997 and 1998, SCNM ex perienced significant financial and administrative difficulties. Although the CNME stated that it had clos ely followed the situation and urged school offici als to correct the problems, the U.S. DOE staff and a majority o f NACIQI members c oncluded that CNME had failed to issue a timely ord er to show caus e why SCNM should not have its c andidacy for accreditation ended. The U.S. DOE withdrew its recognition of the CNME on January 16, 20 01. In September 2003, CNME regained its U.S. DOE recognition with a renewal date set for 2005. In June 2005, NACIQI voted to recommend that the U.S. DO E grant re-recognition fo r three additional years to the CNME. Subsequen tly, the U.S. DOE extended the recognition of the CNME for three years. 6 The first two years of graduate study in naturopat hic medical colle ges focus on the standard medical s ciences (e.g., anatomy, physiolog y, pathology, biochemistr y, immunology, embryology, and related areas), with specialty courses in pediatrics, obstetri cs, cardiology, dermatology, neurology, urology , and ot her clinica l sciences. During this period of study, students als o begin their training in diagnos tic procedures (physic al examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging). During the third and fourth academic years , clinical methods of natur opathic medicin e are presented in preventive medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics, gynecology, obstetrics, physical tice management. The focus on therapeutic interventions intensifies, covering the broad range of diverse natural treatment modalities such as clinical nutrition and diet, botanical medicine, homeopat hy, naturopathic physical medicine, hy drotherapy, counseling, and h ealth psychology. During this clinical phase, students ar e also trained in pharmac ology, cons istent with a naturopathic scope of practice and in minor o ffice procedures, such as remo val of superficial lesions and suturing of minor lacerations. In addition, during the third and fourth years of the naturopathic medi cal pr ogram, students participate in clinical internsh ips, whic h consist of 1,500 hour s of treating patients under the supervision of licensed naturopathic and convent ional medical physicians. At the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon for example, c linical training hours comprise 1,525 of the total 5, 188 hours of instruction. Though not required for graduation, if an individual wishes to ga in more clinical experience, he or she may enter a naturopathic postdoc toral residency pr ogram. The SCNM, for example, has developed an inte grated residency program, w hereby resident s are expo sed to private practice, community clinics, res earch, and teaching environme nts. In addition, affiliation agreements with are a hospita ls and m edical c linics offer access to hospita l facilities, in cluding em ergency rooms. The C ancer Tr eatment Centers of America offer a full-time, two-year naturopathic residency progr am at its Midwestern Regional M edical Center. The program highlig hts general medicine with a st rong emphasis on naturopathic oncology. Currently, Utah is the only state r equiring a one-year residency prior to obtaining a license. There are three nat uropathic medical c olleges in the United States accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the CNME and one college that is a candidate for accreditation. These colleges in clude Bast yr University in Se attle, Washington; National College of Naturopathic M edicine in Portland, Oregon; the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medic ine in Scottsdale, Arizona; and the University of Br idgeport in Bridgeport, Connectic ut (candidacy status). A minimum of three years of under graduate premedical study from an accredited college or univer sity is a pr erequisite f or entry to an accredited naturopathic medical college. 7 Bastyr University was founded in 1978 t o train natur opathic physicians with a sc ientific approach. Since then, degree progr ams in nutrition, acupunctur e and Orie se sc ience, and herbal sciences and health have been added. In addition to accreditation by CNME, Ba styr is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Northwest Asso ciation of Schools and Colleges. The Bastyr University AIDS Res earch Center was est ablished in October 1994, under a cooperative grant from the National Instit ute of Healt h's National Inst itute of Allergy and Infec tious Diseas e and the National Center on Comp lementary and Alte rnative Medicine. Founded in 1956, the National Coll ege of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM) is the oldest naturopathic medical school in No rth America. The Naturopathic Physic ian (N.D.) degree accredited by the CNME is a four-year gr aduate program that prepares graduates for licens ure and the general practice of natu ropathic medicine. NCNM was the first naturopathic institution to devel op a residenc y program certifi ed by the CNME. The program has site residenc ies in six states and 18 r esidents for the 2003- 2004 acad emic year. Over 50 percent of the licensed nat uropathic physicians practicing in the United States are graduates of NCNM. In June 2005, NCNM receiv ed accredi tation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. The accreditation was backdated to the beginning of the academic year co mmencing on September 1, 2004. The Doctor of Naturopathic M edicine pr ogram began at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine & Health Sciences (SCNM) in 1992. The SCNM is approved by the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Board of M edical Examiners and the Arizona Boar d for Private Post-Secondary Educat ion and accredited by the CNME. Additionally, the college has candidacy status with the Higher Learning Commis sion of t he North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The residency progr am at SCNM is a post graduate, formal education program that offers t he participant the opportunity to gain a wide range of c linical experiences in the ar ea of family practice m edicine. SCNM has a num ber of preceptorship opportunities for graduates. A preceptorship, as opposed to a residency position, allows a graduate (licensed or unlicensed) to practice under a licens ed naturopathic physician in a clinical setting. The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (N.D.) degree program offered at the Univ ersity of Bridgeport was licens ed by the s tate of Connecticu t Department of Higher Education in May 2000, and granted Candidacy St atus from the CNME in March 2001. Examinations In 1985, in response to a need f or the developm ent of standards for licensing naturop athic physicians, a group of licensed naturopathic ph ysicians Naturopathic Phys icians Licens ing c ontracted with the National Assessm ent Institute to do the initial development of the examination. A questionn aire was sent to licensed naturopathic physicians nat ionwide to determine which functi ons of diagnos is and treatment were being encountered in pract ice, and to a ssess the level of fr equency and criticality associated with each aspect. A set of s even (7) c linical examinat ion blueprints were developed, on which t he NPLEX is based. T wo \"Add-On\" e xaminations (in Homeopathy and Minor Surgery) were also made available to jurisdictions that required demonstrated competence in these areas. 8 The National Assess ment Instit ute set standards for test devel opment, administration, item review, and scoring, all of whic h are follo wed today. NPLEX has contracted with ot her organizations (including Colum bia Asses sment Services and the Washington St ate Department of Healt h) to provide the ex amination production and scoring ser vices. Gradually, NPLEX, Inc. has taken over more of the responsibility for this process. For the purposes of the App licant's request for licensure, the psychometrician from the Divis ion of Registrations reviewed the exami nation development, scoring, and securit y of NPLEX. A summary and total analysis may be found in Appendices A and B beginning on page 40. 9 SSuummmmaarryy ooff CCuurrrreenntt RReegguullaattiioonn TThhee CCoolloorraaddoo EExxppeerriieennccee From 1923 until it closed in the 1960s, the University of Natura l Healing Arts and its College of Naturopathy was located in Denver and trained naturopathic doctors, physical therap ists, and chiropractors. The schoo l offered a four-year, dence dual c hiropractic and naturopathic degree program . Currently, there are no f our-year programs in Colorado accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of E ducation that offer Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degrees. There ar e no laws to regulate the practice of naturopathic physicians, or to establis h standards for scope of practice. For example, in Colorado, ther e is a practicing Doct or of Naturopathic Medicine wit h a diploma from the Colorado Univer sity of Naturopathic Medicine. His diplom a is emboss ed with a seal from the Colorado Alte rnative Medical Regulatory Boar d. A copy of this diploma \"establishes confirmation of cert ification, acc reditation, and licens e endorsement in a single authenticating document.\" Res earch was initiated to further compile information on the Colorado University of Naturopathic M edicine and the Colorado Alternative Medica l Regulatory Board. The only information av ailable on the Colora do Un iversity of Naturopathic Medicine was found on the state websites of bot h Michigan and Oregon, which list colleges and univ ersities whose degrees are not accepted by the state civil servic e as satisfying any educational requir ements. Furthermore, the Stat e of Oregon proc laims that a degree from this entity is invalid for use in state or licensed employment in Oregon and the use of such degrees can result in criminal prosecution or ci vil penalties depending on the circumstances of the use. Moreover, the Colorad o Alter native Medical Regulatory Board has no affiliation with any State of Colorado regulatory authority. Although t he sunris e review c onducted in 1993 recom mended again st regulation, a bill for full regulat ion and lic ensure of naturopathic physicians was int roduced in the General Assembly, indic ating that the Joint Sunris e/Sunset Committee found that regulation was necessary. The 1998 Sunrise Review of Naturopat hic Physicians maintains: \"While it is not clear whet her the sunrise crit eria for regulation have been sati sfied, there are reasons to consider regulation of naturopathic phys icians.\" Furthermore, the review states that if the Colorado General Assembly determines that the regulation of naturopat hic physicians is necessary, a licens ing scheme administer ed by th e Director of the Div ision of Regist rations could provide adequat e public pr otection. 10 Sloan's Lake Managed Care Sloans Lake Managed Ca re provider network is compri sed of approximately 10,500 individual providers. In its capacity as a Preferred Provider Organi zation (PPO), Sloan's Lake provides managed care s ervices to insurance carriers and corresponding employer groups. It is among the first managed care compani es offering alt ernative care. Alternative care offered in the network includes acupun cture, ayurvedic medicine, Chinese medic ine, herbology, homeopathy, massage therapy, mind/ body interventions, and naturopathic medicine. The criteria that Sloan's Lake Managed Car e uses fo r credentialing Naturopathic Doctors includes the following: \u0083 Completion of a four year Council on Naturopathic Medical Examination (CNME) accredited doctoral program in Naturopathic Medicine; \u0083 Passing sc ing Examination (NPLEX); \u0083 Current license to practice in a state wh ich regulates the practi ce, with no pending investigations or action by that state's licens ing board; and \u0083 Completion of a one year residency program or a minimum of five years experience in full time practice. Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians There are approximately 84 natur opathic physicians in Colorado who have graduated from CNME-acc redited colleges. Of these 84, 74 main tain licens es in states that have a regulatory program to license naturopathic physicians. Of t hese 74 naturopat hic phys icians, 45 are professional members of the Colorado Association of Naturopathic Phys icians (CANP). CANP, established in 1985, is a professional associ ation of naturopathic physicians formed to promote t he merits of naturopathic medic ine in Colorado and to work towards a law that would enabl e its members to practice. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) recogniz ed the CANP as a co nstituent organization in the fall of 1987. Active members in the CANP must hold ei ther a valid license to pract ice naturopathic medicine in a state with a board of examiners recognized by the AANP or hold a degree of Doctor of Naturopat hic Medic ine from a naturopathi c medical c approved by the CNME. 11 IInn OOtthheerr SSttaatteess The legal status of natur opathy varies from state to state. In some states, the practice of naturopathy, though not regul ated, is protected through court rulings or attorney gene ral opinions. In most states, naturopathic physician st atus is unpr otected or unclear. Two states, Florida and Nevada, hav e repealed regulation of this profession. Nevada ceased licens ing naturopathic physic ians in 1987 (in Ne vada naturopathic physic ians were required to be supervised by medical doctors). Al though naturopathic licens ing in Florid a was discontin ued in 1959, there ar e still laws and a boa rd regulat ing those naturopaths still practicing. Florida allows natur opathic physicians lic ensed pr ior to program termination dates to c ontinue to practice. In Tenness ee and in South Caroli na, the practic e of naturopathy is illegal. Tennessee law, for example, provides that the practice of naturopathy is a Class B misdemeanor, but r enders this prohibition inapplic able to \"persons who comply with the regulatory laws of the state with respect to the practi ce of the various healing arts.\" Without a similar textual qualif ication, however, a South Ca rolina statute prohibit s the practice of naturopathy and subjects offenders to a fine not to exceed $500 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one y ear, or both. The multiplicity of therapies and t echniques that typically comprise the statutory definitio n of naturopathy may often fall within the scope of practice for other prof essions. The Montana Naturopathic Practice Act expres sly acknowledges this fact by recogniz ing that many of the therapies used by naturopathic physicians, such as the use of nutritional supplements, herbs, foods, homeopathic preparations, and such physical forces as heat, cold, water, touch, and light, are not the e xclusive priv ilege of naturopathi c physicians, and their use, practice, prescription, or administration by persons not licensed to practice naturopathic medicine is not prohibited by this practice act. Currently, 15 states and the Dist rict of Columbia license naturopathic phy sicians: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticu t, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, K ansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, V ermont, and Wash ington. In several states, licensed naturopathic physicians must also qualify for a ce rtificate to practice natural childbirth, acupunctur e, or to dispense a natural substance or device. The foll owing highlights the regulatory programs found in the 15 states. Alaska's law plac es several restrictions on t he practice of naturopathy. A person who practices naturopathy may not pr escribe a prescription drug, pe rform surgery, or use the word \"physician\" as a title. There are curr ently 36 licens ed naturopathic doctors in Alaska. 12 Arizona's Naturopathic Phys icians Board of M edical Examiner s (Arizona Board) was established in 1935. Arizona remains the st ate with the third highes t number of licensed naturopathic physicians (400). T he Arizona Board has the statut ory authority to adopt rules for recognizing naturopathic spec ialties. Th e Arizona Board has appr oved training programs in four specialty areas and has is sued certificates to at least 16 naturopaths in the specialt y of family medicine. Addition ally, the Arizona Board has asse mbled a formulary of more than 460 items that naturopathi c phy sicians may dispense incl uding both prescrip tion drugs and some controlled substances. In 2000, the Arizona Board under went a performance audit. The review c onclud ed that terminating the Arizona Board woul d not significantly harm the public 's health and safety since the practice of medicine would cont inue to be regulated by the Allopathic Board of Medical Examiners. Naturopaths could continue to perform many traditional activities , but would no longer be allowed to act as primary medical care provid ers. Howe ver, the review further stated that te rminating the Arizona Board could har m the public 's welf are by potentially limiting acc ess to alte rnative medical c are. Subseq uently, there was no action taken by the Arizona legislatur e to repeal the Arizona Board. California's . The Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine (Bureau) within the Department of Consumer Affairs was establis hed to administ er the Naturopathic Doctor's Act and was authorized to collect f ees and re ceive license applications beginn ing Januar y 1, 2004. This act authorizes the creation of an adv isory committee comprised o f three lic ensed naturopathic doctors, three lic ensed physici ans, and three public m embers. The committee's first meeting was convened on December 13, 2004. Additionally , a naturopathic formulary advis ory committee wa s formed and a natur opathic childbirth attendance advisory committee was created to issue recom mendations concerning the practice of naturopathi c childbirth attendance. The scope of practice for licensed naturopat hic doctors includes diagnosis and treatment of patients, including the authority to order lab tests and pr escribe most drugs subject to supervision of a medical or osteopathic physi cian. Licensed naturopathic doctors may perform minor procedures, such as treating la cerations and removing moles and growths. The program began accepting lic ense applic ations in January 2005 . Currently there are 129 licens ed naturopathic doctors in California. Connecticut's law, which was enacted in 1920, does not allow licens ed naturopathic physicians to perform minor surger y, prescribe drugs, or practice obstetrics and gynecology. The statute requires that naturo pathic phy sicians maintain professiona l There are currently 196 licensed naturopaths in Connecticut. 13 District of Columbia In May 2004, final approval was given to t he Naturopathic Medicine Licens ing Amendment Act of 2004 to lic ense naturopathic physicians as primary car e providers. The act recogniz ed naturopathic ph ysicians who have completed four-years of naturopathic medical colle ge training and successfully pass ed the NPLEX. Prior to the passage of this act, the District of Columbia had a registration program for naturopaths. A person registered to practice naturopathy was entitled to use the title \"Doctor of Naturopathy.\" The only requirem ents for regist ration were that applican ts must be at least 18 years of age and not have been convicted of a cr ime of moral turpitude that bears directly on the applicant's fitness to be re gistered. The practic e specif ically excluded the use of x- rays, performing any surgical procedure, inject ing any substance into a person by needle, or performing any invasiv e procedure. As of September 2005, the Distric t of Columbia had not promulgated any rule s or issued any licens es. Florida's licensing authority for naturopathic physic ians was abolished in 1959 a nd licens ees who were licensed at that time were allowed to continue practici ng naturopathic medicine. Draft legis lation pr oposed by the Florida Nat uropat hic Physician As sociation was introduced in 2004 to reestab lish regulation of nat uropathic medicine through lic ensure and to create the Board of Natu ropathic Medicine within the Department of H ealth. A 2004 Sunrise Report on Pro posed Licensure of Naturopathic Physic ians, by the Florida Hous e of Represent atives, Committee on Health Care, c oncluded that while there is evidence for support of licens ure based on the existenc e of accredited training programs and lic ensure examinations, there is no doc umented evidence of substantia l risk from not licensing naturopathic physic ians. Moreover, there is potential risk from licens ing naturopathic physicians and allowing them to provide a broad range of primary care services. Hawaii has regulated naturopat hic physicians sinc e 1925. There are curre ntly 81 lic ensed naturopaths. Originally, the Board of Health wa s responsible for conducting examinations and issuing licenses . In 1969, the regulati on was transferred to the Department of Regulatory Agencies, now the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. The regulation of naturopathy wa s reviewed in 1978 and 1985, with continued regula tion recommended in both instances. Idaho became the 15th state i n 2005 to creat e a licens ure program for naturopathic physicians. The legislation is a full sc ope and title protection act. The law requires the creation of a formulary council to determi ne pharmaceutical privileg es for naturopathic physicians. Kansas passed legis lation during t he 2002 legislativ e session to regulate the practice of naturopathic medicine . The bill, signed into la w in May 2003, provides registration for naturopathic doctors, rather than licensi ng, yet requires educational and testing requirements. Naturopathic medicine is defined to include such procedures as venipuncture, naturopathic acupuncture, and minor office procedures. Naturopathic doctors may not perform surgery, practice obstetrics, administer ionizing radiation or prescri be, dispens e or administer any controlled substanc es or any prescription-only drugs except those listed on the naturopathic formu lary adopted by the Kansas board. 14 Maine's Board of Complimentary Health Care Providers regulat es 19 naturopathic doctors. Naturopathic doctors have the exclusive right to the use of the terms \" naturopathic doct ors,\" \"naturopathic,\" \"naturopath,\" \" doctor of the term \"physician\" by a licens ee is prohibited. Naturopathic Do ctors have a limited scope of prescriptive authority. Montana's Naturopathic Health Care Practice Ac t was enacted in 1991 to regulate lay midwives and naturopathic physicians. Natur opathic physicians are authorized to perform minor surgery, attend a natural c hildbirth if in possession of a cert ificate of specialty prac tice, and prescribe certain drugs as established by the nat ural s ubstance formulary list. When the program first began there were only fiv e licensed naturopathic physic ians in the st ate, however, as of August 2005, there were 66. New Hampshire's Naturopathic Health Care Practice Act was enacted in 1994. Spec ialty certificates in naturopathic ch ildbirth and ac upuncture are offer ed. Doctors of naturopathic medicine with spec ialty certification in natur opathic c hildbirth are author ized to use oxyt ocin and pitocin. There are currently 36 licensed naturopathic physicians in New Hampshire. Oregon first began licensing naturopathic physicians in 1927, although they were able to practice before then under an ex emption in the Osteopathic Pr actice Act. The total number of licensed naturopathic physic ians in Oregon equals 636, ranking second f or licensees in a state. Oregon als o has the most encompassing la w as practitioners are allowed to prescribe drugs, perform minor surgery, and practic e natural childbirth with a certificate of special competency. Utah's Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Board wa s created in 1996. The board currently issues fiv e different categories of lic enses: naturopath, naturopath inc luding surgery/obstetrics, naturopat hic physician, temporary naturopathic physician, and naturopathic controlled substance. In order to perform natur opathic childbirth, a licensee must satisfy the standards of the American College of Natu ropathic Obstetricians or its successor. Vermont's licensed naturopathic physic ians may order , prescribe, dispens e, and administer certain medications of miner al, animal, or botanic origin and must adhere to the Naturopathic Physic ian Formulary Rules promul gated by the Vermont Department of Health. Licensees may not practice naturopathic child birth unless they have obtained a special endorsement that requires spec ific education; training; passa ge of an examination; and actual childbirth assistance, participation, and observation. Washington has regulated naturopathic phys icians s ince 1919, as part of it s law created to regulate professions engage d in \"drugless healing.\" The law was substantially amend ed in 1988 to ref lect the cur rent practice of naturo pathic phys icians. T he total number of licens ed naturopathic physicians in Washington is 650, r anking first for licensees in a state. 15 16Legal scopes of practice accompany licensi ng acts. Naturopathic physicians often must adhere to different sets of laws and regulations promulgated by the legislative a nd licensing bodies in the va rious jurisdictions that lic ense them.

The Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physi cians (Applicant) argues that harm can come to consumers through improper diagnosis, improper dispens ing of medicine, inap propriat e application of therapies, and failure to recognize conditions requiring referral. To suppor t their claim that regulation of naturopat hic phys icians is needed to pr otect the public, the Applicant provided the following case studies regarding act ual or potenti al harm. A review o f these cases reveals that some natur opaths are alleged to have ca used signific ant harm, while others are alleged to have enga ged in inappropriate conduct. Case 1A: 17-Year Old Female in Wheatridge, Colorado Experienced Cardiac Arrest. (Rocky Mountain News, July 20, 2004 ) A health care practitioner who ref erred to himsel f as a naturopathic medi cal doctor performed a procedur e called photolum inescence or ultraviolet blood irra diation. In such a process, blood is removed from the bod y, passed under ultraviolet ligh t, and injected back into the body. The procedure is purported to combat illnes s by increasing o xygen in the blood , stimulating the immune system, and fighting viruses and toxins. Following t he blood treatment, the 17-year old female went into cardiac arrest and was rushed to a local hospital in critical condition. Physicians at the hospital where the female was treated reported that she had h ad a heart attack possibly triggered by an air bubble or embolism, anaphy lactic shock, or a contaminated product. The practitioner was arrested on charges of practicing medici ne without a licens e, criminal impersonation, assault, and theft. The practitioner's n aturopathic degree was awarded by a correspondence cours e offered by the Herbal Healer Academy locat ed in Mountain View, Arkansas. In addition, this practitioner exhi bited a license from t he Federal Intermediary Counc il on Alternative Medicine in Washington, D.C., as a naturopathic medic al doctor and a diploma from the Colorado Univer sity of Naturopathic Medicine. 22 Case 1B: Questionable Medicine: Criminal Charges Focu s Spotlight on Alternative Healing, Wheatridge, Colorado. (Rocky Mountain News , September 25, 2004, p.23A and February 8, 2005.) On several occasions , the naturopathic medical doctor described in Case 1A treated a 19- year old male patient with a photoluminescence procedure for his ter minal canc er. The treatments were promoted as bei ng abl e to fi ght disease and cancer by ki lling tox ins and mutated cells in the blood and by stimulating the body's imm une system to fight disease. After each treatment, the patient's blood oxygen level content declin ed significantly. During the final treatment that involved taking blo od from the patient's body, his blood oxy gen plummeted to 17. A healthy lev el would be in the high 90s. T he patie nt died the next day. The family believes that their son was deprived of his last few months of life because of this treatment that was provided by the naturopathic m edical doct or. The practitioner faces charges of manslaughter fo r his treatment of this 19-year old male patient. Case 2: Naturopath Guilty in Diabetic's Death. (Citizen-Times.com, ( Ashville Citizen - Times: Voice of the Mountains) April 16, 2002, http://orig.citizen-times.com An eight-year old female in As hville, North Carolina who was a n insu lin dependent diabetic, was the patient of an unlicens ed naturopath. The naturopat h's credential inc luded board certification in c linical naturopathy from the Americ an College of Naturopathy. This certification is not affiliat ed with any four-year medical pr ogram recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. The naturopath reco mmended that the child c ease taking insulin. Subsequently, an autopsy determined t hat the child died of high blood sugar levels broug ht on by insulin deprivation. The practitioner was found guilty of practicing medicine without a licens e and involuntary manslaughter. Case 3: Adult Female Tr eated for Breast Cancer. (Letter fro m Dr. Paul Reilly, ND, L.Ac dated June 26, 2004, Cancer Tr eatment Center of Americ a, Seattle, Washington) An adult female was being treat ed for breast cancer by an unlic ensed naturopathic do ctor in Idaho. She was repeatedly told by the practiti oner that she was improv ing. Her c ondition deteriorated such that she visited the Cancer Tr eatment Center of America (CTCA) in Se attle, Washington. CTCA is a network of cancer tr eatment hospitals and facilities. Its approach combines the latest medical, surgical and r adiologic al therapies with supportive therapies lik e nutrition, mind-body m edicine, ph ysical ther apy, naturopathy, and spiritual wellness. When the patient was evaluated at CTCA, it was determined that the cancer had destroyed the entire breast and had penetrated into the underlying m uscle and bone. Dr. Reilly r eported in his letter that he had seen other patients wit h large we eping lesio ns that became inf ected and necrotic because they delaye d treatment on the advi ce of unlicensed ND's in ot her states who assu red them they were improvi ng despite all evidence to the contrary. 23 Case 4: Licensed Naturopathic Doctor in Arizona Convict ed of 185 Counts of Illegal Distribution of Controlled Substances. (Arizona Republic , May 13, 2004, December 22, 2004) In 2004, a licens ed naturopathic doctor in Scotts dale, Arizona was convicted in federal court of 185 cou nts of illega l distributio n of controll ed substa nces and was sentenc ed to 12 years in prison and three years of supervised release for dis tributing the drugs ov er an 18- month period. The practitioner was convicted of know ingly and intentionally d istributing cont rolled substances outside his legitimate practice and without legitimate medica l purposes. The U.S Attorney's Office reported that e vidence at t he trial indicated 10 patients and 2 under cover Drug Enforcement Agents posing as patients received over 10,000 doses of prescribed narcotics. It was determined that the drugs dispens ed, whic h included O xyContin, Perc ocet, we re Case 5: Van Nu ys \"Faith Healer\" Sent enced to Nin e Years in State Prison. (Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office Release, February 9, 2004, http://da.co.la.ca.us/mr/020904b.htm ), Los Angeles Times , February 10, 2004, pg. B4. A 54-year old male in Californi a consulted a naturopathic faith healer seeking treatment for a persistent skin disorder. After being injected with v itamins and an anti-inflammatory drug, the man went into convulsions and later died. T he faith healer was subsequen tly sentenced to nine years in prison for practi cing medicine without a license and injecting dr ugs into a man who later died. Case 6: Utah Man Charged in Cancer Patient's Death. (Deseret Morning News , November 21, 2004), ( In the Fourth District Court of Utah County, State of Utah , November 15, 2004, Case No. 041404455) A Canadian practitioner of al ternative medicine who periodically visited Utah to see patients was charged with three third-degree felonies involv ing practicing medicine without a license. If convicted on all three accounts, he faces up to 15 years in prison. According to court documents: (a) the practitioner allegedly treated a Utah wom an who had breast cancer and subseque ntly died in October 20 04; (b) the incl and homeopathic products; and (c) t he woman was advised to eat apricot pits and hav e her amalg am fillin gs removed. The practitioner allegedly determined that her cancer dev eloped bec ause of gangrene and mercury poisoning in her teeth. The practitioner applied for a Utah naturopathi c licens e in 1997, but wa s denied bec ause he lacked appropriate qualifications. 24 Case 7: Colorado Woma n with Thy roid Condi tion B ecame Dangerousl y Ill After Follow ing Advice of a Naturopath. (Letter from Patient in Durango, August 5, 2004) A 47-year old woman visited a naturopathic docto r in Durango because she was experiencing a persistent feeling of malaise for several months. This practition er presented to the public as a Doctor of Naturopathy on the ba sis of her national ce rtification and board certification by the American Naturopathic Medical Ce rtification and Ac creditation Board. The practitioner's disclos ure statement declared th at she would not adv ise any patient to quit any prescription medication. However, according to the patient, the practitioner stated that she could cure the thyroid dis ease and that there would no longer be a need for t he hormone medication that she had been taking for 20 years. Results fro m a diagn ostic mach ine utiliz ed by the n aturopath indicated that the pa tient's thyroid and pituitary glands were malfunctioni ng and t hat she had Epstei n-Barr virus. She was given a detailed schedule to wean herself from the thyroid medication. Despite complaints of increasing fatigue, the practitioner continued to tell the pat ient that her thyroid was functioning and s he did not need the prescription medication. Evaluations were ba sed on the results from the diagnostic m achine. No l ab work was ordered. Due to increasing fatigue and other symptoms, the pat ient visited an endocri nologist who ev aluated her thyroid function and subs equently determined that her thyroid was in the dangerous and crit ical range. Under treatment through her endocrinologist, the patient recovered. The patient wrote to the naturopathic doctor to complain about her treatment outcome, but the practitioner denied making any suggestion to stop the thyroid medici ne and refused to take any responsibility for the patient's condition. Case 8: F ederal Ag ents Raid \"Natur Rh ode Island . (The Prov idence Journal, January 8, 2005 and June 18, 2005) The Prov idence Journal reported that the office of a practitioner in Rhode Island was raided i n January 2005 and again in April 2005 by F ood and Drug Admini stration and Int ernal Revenue Service agents who s eized equipm ent and dietary supplement produc ts. It was reported that a complaint from a state medica l board official purported that the practitioner was practicing medicine without a license. He continued to practice until t he Health Department suspended the practice in June 2005 maint aining that the practitioner was an immediate danger to the public. Evidence was submitted by the Health Department indic ating that the practitioner had presented himself as a naturopathic doctor and a medical doctor. At the hearing, the practitioner agreed to accept the Health Depar tment's suspension of his natural h ealing practice. 25 Case 9A: Adult Female Patient Instruct ed to Cease Taking Th yroid Medicine. (In the Fourth District Court of El Pa so County, State of Colorado, 2005, Case No. 2005CV2881) In July 2004, a Colorado wo man visited a naturopathic ph ysician who is licens ed as a naturopathic physician in Montana, and as an acupuncturist in Colorad o. The practitioner held hims elf out to the public as having ex tensive clinical experienc e in proctology, homeopathy, minor surgery, hemorrhoid treatm ent, spinal manipulation, and labo ratory diagnostics . The patient informed the practiti oner of her under active thyroid that had been persistent for the previous eight years. The patient alleged that the naturopathic phy sician sold the patient \"USP\" Armour thyroid medici ne (pig gland), for whic h prescribing authority (medical license) is required in Colorado. Wi thin a month, the patient suffered from hot flashes, hair loss, fluid retenti on, weight gain, and fati gue. A blood test was performed at the office of the endocrinologist, who reported that t he results indicated a very low thyroid level. The endocrinologist indicated that the implic ations for not taking prescription thyro id medication in the long-term coul d be fluid retention, weight gain, sluggishness, rise in cholesterol levels, myxedema, and heart attacks. An injunction by th e Colorado Board of Medical Examiners was imposed on the naturopat hic physician for engag ing in the unlicensed practice of medicine. The final disposition ( September 1, 2005) of th is case between the Colo rado State Board of Medical Examiners and the nat uropathic physician (defendant) in cluded the following terms: (1) the defendant will not engage in the prac tice of medicine as de fined in section 12-36-106, et seq. , C.R.S., (2) the defendan t will not pe rform any kind of surgical operation (as defined in the permanent injunc tion) upon a human being, and ( 3) the defendant agreed not to practice proctology, surgery, the writing of or dis pens ing of prescriptions for prescription drugs, intravenous therapy, vitamin and miner al inje ctions, topical anesthesia injections, and obstetrics. Case 9B: Adult Male Tr eated for Hemorrhoids. (In the Fourth District Court of El Paso County, State of Colorado, 2005, Case No. 2005CV2881) In March 2002, a m ale patient presented to a hospital emergency room in Colorado with complaints of painful hemorrhoids. The em ergency room physician evaluated the patient, determined that the sit uation was not an emergency, and diagnos ed that the patient suf fered from inflamed hemorrhoids. The physic ian pre scribed Demerol, and a topica l anesthetic to relieve the discom fort, and re commended that the pati ent have a surgeon remove the hemorrhoids at a later date. Later that same day, the patient visited a naturopathic clinic for removal of the hemo rrhoids. The naturopathic physician performed outpatient surgery by removing the hemorrhoids. The practitioner held himself out to the public as having ext ensive clin ical experience in proctol ogy, homeopathy , minor hemorrhoid treatment, spinal ma nipulation, and laboratory diagn osing. An injunction was imposed on the naturopathic physi cian for engaging in the unlic ensed prac tice of medicine (see case #9A for the final disposition). 26 Of the cases described previously, five cases in volved three Colorado practitioners and si x cases occ urred in other states. Of the thr ee Colorado practitioners, two who ident ified themselves as naturopathic practitioners had not graduated from Council on Naturopathic Medical Education-accredited in stitutions. Only one of the Colorado pr actitioners held a licens e in a state that licenses naturopathic physicians . The majo rity of these illustrations of physical harm or potential har m were caused by individ uals who would not be allowed to represent themselves as natur opathic phy sicians or naturopat hic medica l doctors if the licens ing s cheme submitted was adopted by the General Assembly. NNeeeedd ffoorr RReegguullaattiioonn The second sunrise criterion asks: Whether the public needs and can reasonably be expect ed to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing pr ofessional or occupational competence. There are currently 84 naturopat hic physicians practicing in Colorado who have grad uated from CNME-accredited naturopath ic medic al colleges . Since they are unregulated, they cannot per form the full range of services that they are tr ained to perform, because some services could be inter preted as the practice of medicine, the practice of phy sical thera py, or the practice of chiropractic therapy. There are other problems for the practitioner and the patient in the current system. Without licens ure, naturopathic physi cians have a more difficult time procuring malpractice insurance that would provide additional sa feguards to the public. Currently , three carriers write policies for naturopathic phys icians practici ng in states with licensing laws, only one writes limited coverage for those practicing in states without licens ing laws. Nor can they be reim bursed under most insurance plans. The lack of licensing presently may inhibit fu ll cooperation between naturopat hic medic ine and other health care providers. As the syste m currently operates, if a referral is necessary, the naturopathic physic ian may find t he medical doctor re luctant to consult on that referral, since the naturopathic phy sician lack s legal authority to practice. In fact, some practices that naturopathic physicians engage in may be included in the definition of the \"practice of medicine.\" \u0089 The \"practice of medicine\" is defined as holding out one's se lf to the public within this state as being able t o diagnose, treat, pre scribe for, palliate, or prevent any human disease, ailment, pain, injury, deformity, or physical or mental conditio n... [\u00a712-36- 106(1)(a), Statutes]. \u0089 Suggesting, recommending, prescribing, or adminis tering any form of treatment, operation, or healing f or the inte nded palliation, relief, or cure of any physic al or mental disease, ailment, injury, condition ... [\u00a712-36 -106(1)(b), C.R.S.]. \u0089 Performing any kind of surgical operat ion upon a human being...[\u00a712-36-106(1)(e), C.R.S.] 27 The current lack of regulation restricts naturopathic physicians ' ability to consult with other health professionals and to utili ze community diagnostic and treatment services, such as laboratory work and diagnostic x- rays. Naturopathic phys icians focus on prevent ion as the key to better health. Regulation of naturopathic physicians would increase access to primary health care practitioners and encourage wellness and preventive care. Few people have the time or expertise to invest igate a health care practitioner's education or credentials. One of the pur poses of regulation is to assure a minimal level of education and competency. State regulation a ssists the consumer in choosi ng a provider with appropriat e training an d skills by issuing lice nses only to those the state deems minimally competent. Public Confusion There are numerous correspondence sc hools and distance education programs easily accessible on the Internet that offer Doctor of Naturopathy degrees. These schools have different standards and graduat ion/certification requir ements (see Appendix C on page 55). Adding to this confus ion, naturo paths often refer to themselves by varying titles, such as \"naturopathic physician\", \"naturopathic medical doctor\", \"Doctor of Naturopathy\", and \"N.D.\" addition, the distinction bet ween other forms of alternativ e medicine is not necessarily known or fully understood by the public. For ex ample, many members of the public do not know the difference between a homeopath and a na turopath. Regulation of naturopathic physicians may help to increase public awar eness and assist the public in determining whic h qualifications to look for in a practitioner. The term \"naturopathic physic ian\" is largely reserved by states with licens ure programs for those who have gone to a four-year accredited naturopathic medica l college. There are als o educational programs for those who refer to themse lves as \"traditional naturopaths\" that offer \"N.D.\" or Naturopathic Doctor degrees. Thes e programs are not accredi ted by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Educ ation. Ac cording to a review of the naturopathic profession by the State of California, Profile of a Profe ssion: Naturopathic Practice ,5 in states that license nat physic ians, the titles \"naturopathic phy \" naturopath\" may be prot ected by statute for use only by those who have completed the four-y ear naturopathic physician program. In addition to the plethora of titles and educ ational programs that ex ist in the arena of naturopathy, there are several organi zations that represent themse lves as the legal authority for licensing naturopaths. For ex ample the Colorado Al ternative Medical Regulatory Boar d (CAMRB) appears to distribute a document periodic ally that affirms that CAMRB, under legal authority of the Colorado De partment of Regulat ory Agenc ies (DORA), functions in cooperation with DORA. This is untrue. 285 Holly J. Hou gh et al., Profile of a Profession: Naturopathic Prac tice. San Fran cisco: Ce nter for the Health Professio ns, University of California, 20 01. To add to t he public 's confusion, during the c ourse of this review, t he Naturopathic National Counc il Inc ., which represents itself as a nati onal licensing agency for traditional naturopaths, contacted DORA and the Color ado Office of the Attorney General, in addition to at torneys general throughout the Unit ed States. The documentation subm itted purports to establish the Naturopathic National Council Inc.'s jurisdicti on over the branch of medicine of traditional naturopathy by prov iding occupa tional lic enses to traditional nat uropaths that includes, but is not limited to Doctor of Natur opathy, nutritional consultants, and herbalists. Furthermore, the Counc il states that the Naturopathic National Counc il, Inc. has jurisdiction ov er the title Doctor of Naturopathy, (N.D.) and they intend to us e this title in practice in Colorado. AAlltteerrnnaattiivveess ttoo RReegguullaattiioonn The third sunrise criterion asks: Whether the public can be ad equately protected by ot her means in a more cost- effective manner. One consideration in establishi ng a new regulatory program is w hether the costs of regulation limit the number of pr oviders. To determine the cost s of any new program various expenditures must be analyzed. The following expenditures ar e most often associated with other DORA professional lic ensing programs: personal s ervices , operating budget, indirect costs, investigations, legal s ervices, adminis trative law j udges, leased space, and information technology services. Licensure generally gives a pr ofessional an economic monopoly to persons who meet the qualifications establis hed by the Legis lature. Additiona lly, the regulatory structure can r estrict the types of activities of those providers regula ted. Lim itations on scope of practice and the activities the practitioner is qualified for, or ot herwise may provide, may reduce market and provider organization flexib ility and efficiency. National and state natur opathic physician associations argue that becau se naturopathic medicine emphasizes prevention, patient participation, and les s technolo gically adv anced treatments, it is a cost effective al ternative to convention al medicin e. Colorado Consumer Protection Act Current Colorado statutes provide some prot ection in the form of the Colorado Consumer Protection Act (CPA). There are currently persons in Colorado using the title \"Ph. D. in Naturopathy\" in Color ado who m ay be in violation of t he CPA, (\u00a7 6-1-707(1)(a ), C.R.S.). The CPA states that persons engaged in decept ive trade practices when they claim, either orally or in writing, to possess an academic degr ee or an honorary de gree of the title assoc iated with that degree, unles s the perso n has been awarded the degree from an institution that is: \u0089 accredited by a regional or professional accrediting agen cy rec ognized by the U.S . Department of Education or the C ounc il on Post-secondary Accreditation; 29\u0089 provided, operated, and suppor ted by a state government or any of its political subdiv isions or by t he federal gov ernment; \u0089 a school, institute, college, or university chartered outsi de the United States, the academic degree from whic h has been validated by an a ccrediting agency approved by the U.S. Department of Education; or \u0089 a religious seminary, institut e, college, or university, wh ich prepares students for a religious vocation, career, occupat ion, profession, or lifework. In addition, the CPA s tates that persons may not us e \"Dr.\", \"Ph.D.\", \"Ed.D. \", \"D.N.\", or \"Th.D\" or any other title that signifies t hey have a doctorate degree, unless their degree falls under the auspic es of the four previ ously mentioned criter ia. None of the doctorate degrees from the correspondence and distance education programs (see Appendix C on pa ge 55) satisfy these criteria. The educ ation, trai ning, and philosophy of these distance educ ation programs are substantially different from t hat of the CNM E graduates. There is potential for confusion for the Colorado resident trying to differentiate among the various persons calling themselves naturopaths, naturopathic physicians, doctor of naturopathy, N.D., Ph.D. in naturopathy, or naturopathic medical doctors. The Color ado Office of the Att orney General has initiated consumer protection actions on behalf of the State of Colorado against individuals who have offered a product or service t o treat or cure a dis ease. Those actions were brought under the Decept ive Trade Practices Act that can be found in section 6- 1-105, C.R.S. While the CPA o ffers some protection to the public against the illegal use of degree title s, a formal regulatory program would offer greater protection and more consistent and thorough oversight. CCoonncclluussiioonn The Purpo se and Implications of Regulation of Health Professions The traditional reas ons given for the regulation of healt h care professions are to prevent non- diagnosis, misdiagnos is, non-treatment and mist reatment by unqualifie d medical providers. The aims of the regulatory mechanism are: 1) protecting the public from the dangers o f unskilled practitioners and unso und treatment or adv ice; and 2) protecting the public from reliance on unskilled practitioners, as well as directing them to proper medical care.6 There are reasons to consider regulation of naturopathic physic ians: it is possible that the public is c onfused by the comm on use of the various forms of the term \"naturopath;\" it is possible that the practice of some naturopaths who re fer to themselves as \"doctors\" are in violation of the Colorado C onsumer Protection Act; and t he use of naturopathic and alternative medicine c ontinues to be utilize d by Color ado consu mers, thus requiring some level of regulatory oversight. The potential r egulation of any health profession has numerous implications for consumers, provi ders, and soci ety as a whole. Sometimes in discussions of the implic ations of regulation, the interests of consumers and prov iders conflic t, while at other times, they Cohen, \"Holistic and Regulatory S chemes.\" Arizona La w Revi ew. 38, 1 (Sp ring 19 96):83-164. Reason s for Utilizing Complement ary Alternative Medicine (CAM) According to one study, most users of alternative therapies believe they have explored the full utility of conventiona l Wester n approaches. \"Most have chronic illness es (e.g. cancer, HIV infection, or AIDS, arthritis, chronic pain, si nusitis, migraines) for which Wes tern medicine can usually offer only sym ptomatic relie f or palliation, not definitive treatment. Alternative ther apies are often used in c ombination with the appropriate conventional approac hes, as a way of enhanc ing and complementing them. Sometimes al ternative approaches are used inst ead of conventional therapies when the latter have pr oved ineffective or have produced deleterious side effects.\" 7 As noted earlier in this sunrise review, a potent ial for public har m exists in the unregulated practice of naturopathy. What is more, this potential harm arises in the realm of public health, which is arguably m ore important than other ar eas of potential harm, such as pecuniar y damage. Opposition to Licensure Not every one agrees that Complementary Al ternative Medic ine (CAM) represents an appropriate form of medical care. To some, m any of t he therapies cons idered to be CAM represent unscientific treatments that may at best be benign and at worst harmful (Nationa l Counc il Against Health Care Fraud, 1994). The argument made against CAM is that if these therapies were to be proven scient ifically valid, they would be adopted by allopathic m edicine, and would become mainstream. Al though these opponents of CAM often admit that there are some CAM therapies that have been demonstrated to be effective, they maintain that supporting or validating all CAM allows uns crupulous practitioner s to prey on unsuspe cting patients who may be directed away from trul y helpful m edical treatments. Cr itics of CAM poin t to the relative lack of rigorous, controlled e ffectiveness studies, and call for caution in evaluating the usefulness of a therapy until more scientific evaluation can be conducted. Howev er, practices that were once cons idered alternative, such as massage ther apy, acupunctur e, chiropractic manipula tion, and therapeutic application of nutrition, have bec ome more accepted within mainstream medicine. Many acute care, long-term care , and ambulatory care clinic s are beginning to offer CAM. During the sunrise review process, DORA m ade every effort to elicit informati on and comments from all interested parties. Se veral opponents of licens ure for naturopathic physicians responded to the sunris e application by submitting opposition papers and letters to DORA. The Coalition for Natura l Health, the National Council Ag ainst Health Fraud, Colorado Family Phy sicians, Colorado Dental Assoc iation, Colorado Chiropractic Association, and the American Naturopathic Medical A ssociation submitted documents. 317 J.S. Gordon, M.D. \"Alternative M edicin e and Fam ily Physi cian. 54, 7 (1996):2205-2212. Coalition for Natural Health There are a signific ant number of practitioners in Colorado who refer to themselves as \"traditional naturopaths.\" In their report, Profile of a Profession: Na turopat hic Practic e8 the Center for Health Professions at the Univer sity of California describes this group as: practitioners who adhere to the strict est defi nition of natural healing and do not incorporate surgical, non-nat ural phar maceutical or obstetrical care into their practices. They may focus their work on one or more of the various modalities that com prise naturopathic healing. They have a much m ore varied set of pathway s for entry into pr actice and training ranges from self instruction and apprenticeship to formal cour se of study. Practitioners of naturopathy are currently in debate about the def inition of nat uropathy and the training requirements for entry to the profession. T his disagr eement is articulated by two different of h represents providers of \"naturopathic medicine\" and the Coalition for Natural Health, which is a non-profit organizat ion purportedly representing thousands of i ndividuals nationwide to promote the holistic approach to health and to ens ure that natural health alternatives remain widely acc essible to the public. The mission of the CNH is to educate the public to the true meaning of traditional naturopathy, to educate legisl ators to the efficacy of natural healt h and traditional naturopathy, and to prevent legislation that would proh ibit practitioners of natural health modalities including tradi practi cing The CNH submitted a 31-page docum ent to DO RA in oppos ition of licen sure. CNH state s that \"traditiona l naturopaths\" do not use procedures that are common to medical care, such as prescribing drugs and pharmac euticals, performing invasiv e surgical procedures , and deliv ering babies. Instead, they focus on heal th and education, teaching their client s how to create internal and exter nal environments that are conducive to good health. Furthermore, the CNH contends that nat uropat hic physicians seek pr otection from legal prosecution because they know t hat the scope of practice they seek constitutes the practice of medicine. On the other hand, traditional naturopaths can pr ovide traditional naturopathic services to the public in Colo rado - now, without licensure - because traditional n aturopaths do not practice medicine. The Applic ant submitted a response to the CNH 's opp ositional document. In their document, the Applica nt notes that the greatest risk for t he reside nts of Colo rado is tha t diploma mills, distance learning progr ams, and other unaccredit ed progra ms that issue Doctorate of Naturopathy degrees severely lack curriculum, pr ovide no clinic al training, and promote the practice of medicine among their graduates despite this lack of training. Als o, the Applicant maintains that many of the schools of traditiona l naturopathy pose a risk to the public, as evidenc ed by the cases of harm documented in the application and this sunrise report. 8 Holly J.

National Council Against Health Fraud The National Council Against Health Fraud ( NCAHF), compri sed of health professionals, educators, researchers, attorneys, and consumer s, is a non-pr ofit voluntary health agency focusing on health misinformation, fraud, and quackery as public health problems. The Colorado Area Coordi nator of the NCAHF subm itted several articles in addition to a 20- page com mentary to DORA ur ging the denial of licensure fo r naturopathic physic ians. Several key points that it made are listed below: Naturopathic educ ation has only the appear ance of that of a standard medic al school. A foundation in bas ic science s does not qualify anyone to practice medicine. Naturopathic education in di agnosis and treatment is not evidenc e-based and bears no resemblance to standard medical school education. Naturopaths are a public health risk, parti cularly to children. T hey advise the public against fluoridation, pasteuriz ation, and immunization. A principal danger to the public of licensing nat uropaths is the false sense of security that the public is given regarding the com petence of a licensed naturopath to practice medicine as opposed to naturopathy. There are no standard naturopathic treatments for specific conditions in the sense tha t anything is ruled out. Naturopaths are taught to diagnos e and treat patients wit h invalidated, irrational, and potentially dangerous methods. They use their patients as guinea pigs . All divert patients away from evidence-bas ed care. Colorado Famil y Physicians Colorado F amily Phys icians (CFP) represents the Colorado Ass ociation of Family Me dicine Residences and the Colorado As sociation of Family Physicians. Its letter states: The Colorado Assoc iation of Nat uropathic Physicians application for licens ure may ultim ately have merit, if it leads to ensuring patient safe ty by introducing into the naturopathic approach to health c are procedures that are sci entific ally proven to be efficacious and not harm ful to consum ers of health care. The concerns of CFP regarding two iss ues in CANP's application is discussed in the summary b elow. 1. The Consumer's Perception of the Health Care Provider The naturopathic phy sician's us e of family m edicine, primary care physicians, and fami ly physicians is grossly misleading. Furthermore , the education and c linical experience of naturopathic physicians inadeq uately prepares them to recognize an d treat early manifestations of serious illness es that occur among ambulatory pa tients or acute and complex presentations . 33 2. Scope of Practice A defined scope of practice is an essential el ement in protecting patients. Unscientific naturopathic beliefs pose irrational challenges to proven public health measures. Practices within the proposed sc ope of practice for naturopaths are already included in the legal scope of practice for family medi cine. Lic ensing nat uropathic physicians as independent primary care physici ans will deteriorate standards of health care, expose the public to the inev itable risk of inferior medic al service, and c ause further confusion to the health cons umer. Colorado Dental Association In a letter presented to DORA, the Colorado D ental Association expre ssed its opposition to licens supposed 'profession' immerses itse lf in pseudoscienc e, uses quackery to further its i ncome and puts the public at m edical risk (i ntravenous hydrogen peroxide injections), that is not i n the best i nterest of any comm unity. Furthermore, the letter stated th at naturopaths are against the us e of water fluoridation and the use of amalgam re storations (silver-colored fillings). The letter further expounds that fluoridation has been listed as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century by t he Centers for Disease Control and Preve ntion, and amalgam restorations hav e been proven to be a safe and effective restorative material for decayed teeth. Colorado Chiropractic Association The Color ado Chiropractic Association (CCA) submitted a letter to the Colorado Board of Chiropractic Examiners that was forwarded to DOR A. CCA expressed concern that the website of many naturopathic ph ysicians that are linked to the Colorado Chapter of the Association of Naturopathic Phy sicians website, advertise that they perform manipulation. CCA believes that t he use of this advertising misl eads and endangers the public . They contend that naturopathic phys icians should not be per forming m anipulation without a license from the Board of Chir opractic Examiners. American Naturopathic Medical As sociation Founded in 1981, the American Naturopathic Medical Ass ociation's website descr ibes t he association as a nonprofit, scientific, educati onal organization dedica ted t o exploring new frontiers of mind, body, medicine and health. Me mbership is availabl e to indiv iduals with Doctor of Naturopathy (N.D.) or D octor of Na turopathic Medicine ( N.M.D.) degrees, as well as other healt h care fields. The m embers subscri be to the motto \"Doctor do no harm.\" The President Emeritus submitted a letter to DOR A strongly opposing the licensure of naturopathic physicians becaus e they \"lack the education to offer anything beyond natural non-invas ive therapies.\" Furthermore, the letter states that nat uropathic phys icians from four- year resident schools are mislea ding the public into believ ing they are trained like m edical doctors. 34 Benefits of Regulation Regulation of a healt h professi on could, at least in theory, have a number of benefits. First, the regulation might improve t he quality of care consumers receive, as unqualifie d or unethical providers are eliminat ed. Consumers could be protec ted from unknowingly seeking care from an untrained or unskilled provider . Second, consumers may have access to more information on what type of training should be expecte d of a provider of a certain type of care. Consumers might hav e better ability to seek out provide rs with app ropriate training a nd skills. In addition, they create database s, which fac ilitate the monitoring of practitioner geographic distribution and spec ialty, whic h can ass ist pub lic health agencies in planning. Third, providers who are regulated would not be subj ect to legal act ion for practicing within the scope of their profession. The report from the Pew Commission10 articulates the following principles for a health care workforce regulatory system: Promoting effective health outcomes and protecting the public from harm; Holding regulatory bodies account able to the public; Respecting consumers' rights to choose thei r health care providers from a range of safe options; Encouraging a flexible, rational and cost-eff ective health care system that allo ws effective working relationships among healt h care providers; and Facilitating professional and geographic mobility of competent providers. One problem identified in this report is the unsafe practice of unregulat ed naturopathic physicians or other \"healers\" referring to themselves as na turopaths, naturopathic medical doctors, and N.D.s. The foundation princ iple that a pplies to the creation of new occupational regulation in Colorado is whether there is evidenc e that Colorado citizens are being harmed absent regulation, and that the imposition of new regul ation will alleviat e that harm in the most cost- effective manner. The Applic ant has demonstrated that Color ado citiz ens have been harmed, including death, at the hands of one practitioner, and t he applicant has established t hat the potential for future harm, as found across the nati on, exists in Colorado. As discuss ed previously in this report, 15 stat es currently license naturopaths. For the most part, those 15 states regulate naturopathy consistent with t he sunrise proposal of the Applicant. Further, the experie nce of these states shows t hat the regulatory scheme is successful. 3510 Chri stine M. Grag nola a nd Elizabeth Stone, MD, Considering the Future of Hea lth Care Workforce Regulation, Pew He alth Professio ns Commission, Sa n Fran the Health Profes sions, Unive rsity of California, 1995. The negative impact on Colorado citizens as a result of Colorado's status quo is twofold. First, this state's citizens are denied access to a complimentary health care modality. That is so becaus e most of the element s of a naturopathi c scope of practice may violate any nu mber of existing practice ac ts includ ing medical practice and chiropracti c. Therefore, the 70 or so practitioners who would qualify for licens ure under the app licant's proposal could find themselves out of business at any point that a regulatory board might choose to exert its authority. In fact, duri ng the course of this review, the professional association representing chiropractors filed a c omplaint with the Board of Chiropractic Exa miners alleging that s ome naturopaths advertise to per form manipulation. Second, Colorado consumers ar e presently at a disadvantage when choosing a naturopath. This situation is creat ed becaus e anyone can refer to himself or herself as a natur opath, doctor of naturopathy or any other title, regardle ss of training, or in the absenc e of any training at all. This, in fact, is one of the assertio ns made in the case concerning the death of a patient. As this report has dis cussed, there is opposit ion to the creation of a regulatory program for naturopathic physicians as described in the sunrise application. The CNH has thoroughly laid out its opposition to the sunr ise proposal. The Applicant's proposal would impact s ome people who advertise as naturopaths . However, this review find s that the concerns of those practitioners represented by the CNH do not outweigh the public po licy conc erns raised by the Applicant regarding naturopathic practice. The primary consider ation leading to this finding is the extremely disparate training and education that allows entry as a practitioner. Without meaningful accreditation, one c annot reas onabl y ass ess the skill and kno wledge of the practitioner (See discussion \"Public Co nfusion\" on page 28 of this report). The Colorado membership of CNH is u nknow n. Without proper data regarding CNH membership, this review is unabl e to estimate the economic im pact, if any, which would r esult from regulation of naturopaths . As examples, one cannot estima te the number of clients or patients that CNH m embers treat. There is no infor mation ava ilable showing the var iety of treatments employed nor the outcom es of treatments. Nor is it clear what titles t hese practitioners use to advertise. For thes e reasons, this review does not support CNH's position that Colorado should take no action becaus e any action would be detrimental to its membership. An argument raised in oppos ition to the Applic ant's proposal is a broad assault upon the efficacy of naturopathic practice. This opposition makes little or no distinction between groups or philos ophies lumping all naturopathy into t he realm of quackery. Many of these arguments are not compelling, but the most sophisticated of them holds th at nat uropathic practices are not proven effective by medica l standards for testing, and, consequently, natur opathic doctors or physicians are not medical doctors. This review concurs with those premises but di ffers in the conclusion drawn from them. To dispens e with the easiest cas e, naturopathic doctors are not medical doctors and the application for regulation does no t assert that they are, or should be construed as such. 36 This review concurs with the oppo nent's pos ition that naturopathic practice may not satisfy the requirement of allopathic medical research st andards. This standard, however rigorous and time-tested, is not the standard f or regulation of a profession. Colorado c urrently regulates acupunctur e and chiropractic, m odalities that may be or onc e were subject to the same criticisms. The regu latory test for government intervention in consumer choices, and barring clear evidence of fraud, or ot her compounding factors, is to determine the proper lev el of education, experience, exami nation, and subsequent s cope of practice. This, coupled with disciplinary authority ov er practitioners who violate the state's standards constitutes the proper role of government. Ult imately, given a saf e market place in which to choose, consumers will make the appropriate decisio ns more efficiently tha n will government. This review therefore is not convinced by the arguments of opponent s who belie ve that naturopathy should not be regulated becaus e of the lack of effica cy of the practice itself. Regulatory Models The following three regulatory m odels are organized in terms of degree of regulatory burden from least burdensom e to most extensiv e. Title Protection A title protection program could be modeled a fter the title pr otection pr ovisions (\u00a7 6-1- 707(1)(a)(III)(b), C.R.S.) for diet icians found in the Colorado Consumer Protection Act. Following this model, the terms \"naturopath,\" \"and doctor of naturopathic medicine\" would be reserved for those per sons who have gr aduated from an ap proved naturopathic medical colle ge ac credited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) and have s uccessfully passed CNME is ecogniz ed by the U.S. Department of E ducation as the national agency for accreditation of naturopathic medical curriculum. Such a r egulatory scheme posses ses the advantage of offering the public a certain degree of protection an d is less restrictive than a licens ing program. Under a title protection scheme, enforcement would be t aken pursuant to the Colorado Consumer Pr otection Act (CPA) by the Colorado Offic e of the Attorney General. Howev er the CPA has rarely been used to enforce ti tle protection despite the fact that several professions (including dieticians and occupational therapists) are referenced in the CPA. This type of regulation is of limited us e as evidenced by the fact that it was not employed in the recent Colorado case involving a practitioner w ho may well have been in violation of the CPA. 37 Exemption from the Medical Practice Act Section 106 of Article 36 of Titl e 12 of the Colorado Revised St atutes [Medical Practice Act (MPA)] provides exemptions for licensing for spec ific activities. For example, the Board of Medical Examiners (Board) promul gates rules and regulations specifying the types of s ervices that a qualified athletic trainer may render. Naturopaths coul d be exempted from the MPA and other health care acts to allow them to pr actice the full range of their profession (with certain restrictions, if necessary ). Additiona lly, like athletic trainer s there would be stated examination and educ ation qual ifications, in addition to a scope of practice. The public may be adequately protected by re quiring standardized qualifications for individuals holding themselves ou t to be \"naturopathic physicians.\" The authority of the Board in section 12-36-106(2), C.R.S., allows the Board to investigate complaints. Licensure Program A licensing scheme administered by the Director of DORA's Division of Registrations should include provisions addressing the following issues: Title Protection for licensed naturopathic phy sicians Title protection will as sist the public in i dentifying those indiv iduals the state h as determined to be qualified naturopathic physi cians. Individuals who satisfy the educational requirements established by t he state would be per mitted to use the titles \"Licensed Naturopathic Phy sician,\" \"Naturopath\" or any deriv ative thereof. The protected ti tles would be reserved for thos e persons with the following credent ials: (1) Graduated from an approved nat uropathic medical c ollege accredited by, or with a c urriculum equiv alent to, t he accreditation standards of the CNME, and (2) Passed a lic ensur e examination t hat conforms to the standards approved by the Director of the Division of Registrations . A definition of the scope of prac tice for naturopathic phy sicians By defining the practice of naturopathy, it will be c lear which practitioners fall within the scope of the licensing program. Restricting the practice of licensed naturopathic physic ians The restrictions on the practice of \"Licensed Naturopaths\" could prohibit: Prescribing or giving a prescripti on drug or a controlled substance Engaging in minor surgery Practicing obstetrics 38 The program would be cash-f unded and located within the Offic e of the Director of the Divis ion of Registrations. Licensed Naturopaths may be exempted fr om the Medical Practice Act and other health c are acts to allow them t o practice the full range of their profession (with the restrictions above). Full range of disciplinary ac tions against lic ensed nat uropathic physicians, including civil penalties. The Direct or of the Division of Registrations could be granted the authority to convene a Naturopathic Advisory Committee. A licens ing scheme would offer t he public the great est level of regulatory protection. Only those individuals who have fulfil led the requir ements for licens ure would be allowed to e ngage in the scope of practice for naturopathic ph ysicians, thus ensuring a minimum lev el ermined not to implement one of thes e three options, this will leave in effect, Colorad o's status quo as discuss ed. 39 ith Stan dards For Educational and Ps ychological Testing11 - Executive Summar y The Colorado Office of Ex amination Ser vices (OES) within the Department of R egulator y Agencies, Divis ion of Registrations performed a psychometric review of the NPLEX Part II\u2014 Core Clinic al Science Series Examinations. T he NPLE X Part II\u2014Core Clinic al Scie nce Series Examinations consist of eight m ultiple-choice examinations that are intended to meas ure the skills an d technica l knowledge that an entry-lev el naturopathic physician needs to practice safely. There also are three additiona l multiple-c hoice examinatio ns in the Part II-Clinic al Add- On Series. The Part II-Core Clinical Science Se ries is requ ired by ev ery jurisdictio n that regulates the naturopathic professi on. A licensing/regulatory aut hority also may require any or all three examinations in the Pa rt II-Clin ical A dd-On Series. The psychometric review conduc ted by the OES reviewed evidence about (1) the kno wledge and skills identified by NPLEX fo r credential-worthy performanc e as a naturopathic p hysician, (2) the content purported to be assessed by NPLEX Part II\u2014Core Clinical Sc ience Series Examinations, (3) test construction, (4) standard setting and equating/link ing of different forms of a test, (5) reliability and errors of measur ement, (6) test administration, (7) scoring, (8) attention to fairness, and (9) score reporting and records. Th e results of the psychometric review are discuss ed in the report that follows. O verall, findings led to the following k ey observations: \u00be Do the NPLEX Part II Clinical Licen sing Examinations Measure Clinical Competen ce? The NPLE X Part II clinical xamin ation progr am utilizes knowledge\" associ ated with the naturopa thic physician profession. 9 Per the NPLEX 2003 Technical Manual , Item #6, p. 19: \"Limitations of a multipl e choice examination : \"With more than 1000 examinees being tested each year, NPLEX c annot employ formats which could more appropriately test clinical competence (e.g., essay exami nations, model patients).\" 9 To date, there is little generalizable evid ence that the NPLEX Part II clinical licens ing examinations actually measure clinical competenc e. This concer n may be alleviated to some degree if the educat ional programs, which now receiv e programmatic accreditation from the Council of Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), can demons trate that students fulfill sufficient clinical requirements and are tested by independent entities in their c linical competence before they sit for the current NPLEX Part II clin ical licensing exam inations. & Coun cil on Measurement in Education. (1999 ). Standards fo r Educatio nal an d Psycholo gical Test s. Washington, DC: American Ed ucatio nal Research Asso ciation. 9 Until recently, the C NME also served as the institutional accrediting body for naturopathic schools. While t he institutional accreditati on role recently has been shifted appropriately to regi onal accrediting bodies recogni zed by the United State s Department of Education and th e four U. S. natur opathic colleges currently either are in a candidacy status or have attained 5-year institutional accreditation by one of the recognized regional accrediting bodies, the pr evious dual accreditation role assumed by CNME (programmatic and institutional ) may call into question whether development of the naturopathic professi on to date has unfolde d via independent higher lear ning experiences that lead to unbiased theorie s of s cience and practice that produces replicable results. \u00be To What Extent Does Constru ct Under-Represent ation and/or Measurement Imprecision Threaten the Validity of Test Score Interpretations? Each Part II clinical licensing examinati on contains 50% new items that have not been pre-tested. Many of t he clinical licensing examination parts contain only 50 multiple-choice items in total. Items ar e analyzed befor e they are scored; however, if new items do not perform as des ired, then the test may not adequately repr esent the universe of generalization it was intended to represent when it was developed (e.g., new items may have more than one correct ans wer (accept multiple options ) or they may be flawed in way s that render them us eless (all options need to be accepted). 9 Any reliability coefficient using the data will likely overs tate matters because the testing conditions facet is effectively \"fix ed\" in that the test is given in one administration every s ix months and the relia bility coefficient is based on the \"internal consistenc y\" in whic h all of the items measure a comm on characteristic of the examinee (e.g., technical k nowledge) on t hat test administration occasion. Thus, error variance is lik ely to be understat ed by the NPLEX clinical licensing examinations. 9 Any interpr etation of a test score or a comparison of test scores from the NPL EX II clinical licensing examinations must be made with an acute awarenes s of the standard error of measuremen t. Although the magnitude of errors of measurement decreases as the reliability coef ficient in creases, errors of appreciable size can still be found with reliability coefficients that ar e considered to be high (e.g., .90 or .95). The thirteen years of NPL EX examination statistics pr esented in the 2003 NPLEX Technical Manual, Appendix E, and exam ined in pages 7-9 of the following psychometric analyses indicate t hat the ban d within which we ca n be reasonably sure an examinee's true s core lies c an be variable and s omewhat c oncerning if we are drawing c onclusions about technical k nowledge of a candidate based on his/her particular test score. 41 \u00be Are the NPLEX Part II Clinical Li censing Examinations Adeq uate for Licensing Decisio ns if Co lorado Requi red Regulation of Naturopathic Physicians? The II Clin ical ations have many a cceptab le psychometric characteristics, including but not limit ed to evidenc e of: (1) careful test construction, (2) appropriate test administrat ion, (3) attention to scanning ac curacy, (4) psychometric analysis before final test scores are computed, (5) attempts to determine pass/fail cut-points t hat are independent from the di stribution of s cores for a test session, (6) adequate explanation of score conversions, and (7) good documentation about the NPLE X tests and test guides that help examinees know what to expect and how to prepare for the NPLEX examinations. It is feasible that measures of the techni cal knowledge needed for safe practice, suc h as those provided by the NPLEX Part II licensing examinations, can prov ide the assurances required for public protection if: 1. The clinic al competence of natur opathic physicians can be assured via educational or other programs that demonstr ate unequivocally that the graduate can perform safely a scope of practice in wh ich reasonable potential for therapeutic gain s in a patient's medical conditi on out-weighs t he risk of treatment [See \u00a712- 36-117(3)(a), C.R.S. in the M edical Practic e Act that defines \"alternative medicine\" for the purposes of that section]; and 2. The educat ional programs that are programmatically accredited by CNME lead to a naturopathic physic ian degree t hat is granted through instit utions of higher learning that hold accreditation status from an independent regional accrediting body recognized by the U. S. Department of Education.
