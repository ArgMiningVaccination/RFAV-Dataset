On 15 December, the CHMP concluded that a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen may be considered at least two months after the first dose for people aged 18 and over. In 2009, a study published in PLOS One explored how repeated vaccination with the same antigen at short intervals ('booster shots') can overstimulate the immune system, inducing autoimmune processes, as a natural consequence of normal immune response when stimulated maximally beyond the system's self-organised criticality. Among other things, antibodies against one's cells result from gene re-expression mutations, as this research showed [[1]](#def1). What additional information and scientific studies has the CHMP requested to assess this autoimmune risk due to immune system stimulation with additional doses of the same antigen?
