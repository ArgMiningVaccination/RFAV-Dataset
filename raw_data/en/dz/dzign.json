I can't wait to get into my kitchen and play.\" Lori \"Though I cook with many of these spices, I had never realized that they had medicinal properties. I just thought they tasted delish and smelled heavenly. You have really opened my eyes. As I live in Canada, I will especially enjoy trying Trikatu and homemade chai this winter. I sincerely appreciate your generosity in sharing your time and in-depth knowledge with us.\" Elizabeth \"You're the BEST, Deborah! Thank you so much! You're changing my life in beautiful ways.\" Tara \"I wanted to thank you for continuing your pranayama series. It's been such a great way to start my mornings. I have found it has made a big difference in my yoga practice. I am able to go deeper into poses because the length of my breath has expanded. I also noticed increased lung capacity when blowing up my kids pool toys. \" Kristen \"Can't say enough good things about Eternal Radiance Ayurveda! I had the Eternal Bliss package done and left the treatment like I was walking on a cloud. Loved it!\" Lauren \"When I came to Deborah Garland, I had very little knowledge of Ayurveda. I just knew that I felt out of balance and had tried many different treatments and doctors. Her calm way made me feel relaxed as she learned about my issues. She was careful not to overwhelm me with many different ideas or treatments and the few that she started with were effective and nurturing. I look forward to being in her presence and I feel grateful to have someone advising me in such a knowledgable and calm way. She is a partner in my journey of health, happiness and balance.\" Jamie \"My favorite so far is the 100x Washed Ghee! And in one of my orders you gave me Radiant Beauty Balm which I absolutely love!\" Kim \"I am enjoying the learning process and the natural healing I'm receiving. Deborah is helping me change behaviors and teaching me to live a cleaner and healthier life.\" Joni \"Transformative and Healing for the Soul...Deborah is helping me become my true and authentic self and shed practices that are not in harmony with my inner being. The assessment was so thorough and enlightening and Deborah's knowledge of ayurveda explained so much that was going on with my body and finally everything made sense. I am excited to put it all into practice and optimistic that I can make changes that restore my body to a healthy balanced state again at age 60!\" Angie \"I received my oils yesterday!! I love them! I used the bigger oil bottle last night. Feels SO silky smooth!! I'm anxious to try them all!\" Raina \"Deborah Garland is the real deal!

She deepened my practice of pranayama, showed me how to eat for my body type and gave me practical ways to make my body and my life healthier, better, brighter and happier. Deborah lives what she teaches. It is her lifestyle. And her lifestyle is a beautiful example of what happens when we honor and balance the physical, mental and spiritual parts of ourself.
