DESIGNATION OF ACTING PRESI\u00ad DENT PRO TEMPORE The legislative clerk read the following letter: U.S. SENATE, PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, Washington, D.C., February 28, 1967. To the Senate: Being temporarily absent from the Senate, I appoint Hon. FRANK J. LAUSCHE, a Senator from the State of Ohio, to perform the duties of the Chair during my absence. \u00b7 \u00b7 CARL HAYDEN, President pro tempore. Mr. LAUSCHE thereupon took the chair as ,Acting President pro tempore. THE JOURNAL On request of Mr. MANSFIELD, and by unanimous consent, the reading of the Journal of the proceedings of Monday, February 27, 1967, was dispensed with. MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages in writing from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Mr. Jones, one of .his secretaries. HEALTH AND EDUCATION-MES\u00ad SAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT <H. DOC. 68) The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BuR\u00ad DICK in the chair). The Chair lays be\u00ad fore the Senate a message from the Presi\u00ad dent of the United States on health and education. Without objection, themes\u00ad sage will 'be printed in the RECORD, with\u00ad out reading, and appropriately referred. The message from the President was referred to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, as follows: To the Congress of the United States: In Edmonds, Wash., three new eve\u00ad ning classes today are helping 150 high school dropouts finish school \u00b7and gain new job skills. In Detroit, a month ago, 52,000 chil\u00ad dren were immunized against measles, during a campaign assisted by Federal funds. In 25 States, Federal funds are helping improve medical care for 6.4 million citi\u00ad zens who get public assistance. Over 8 million poor children are now getting a better education because of funds provided under title I of the Ele\u00ad mentary and Secondary Education Act. Nineteen million older citizens enjoy the protection of medicare. Three years ago, not one of these pro\u00ad grams existed. Today, they are :fiourishing-because a concerned people and the creative 89th Congress acted. They are the result of 24 new health laws and 18 new education laws. But even the best new programs are not enough. .. Today, we face major challenges of or\u00ad ganization and evaluation. If our new projects are to be effective, we must have the people to run them and the facilities to support them .. We must encourage States and localities to plan more effec\u00ad tively and comprehensively for their growing needs and to measure their progress toward meeting those needs. Above all, each community, each State, must generate a spirit of creative change-a willingness to experiment. In this, my fourth message to Con\u00ad gress on health and education, I do not recommend more of the same, but more that is better----to solve old problems, to create new institutions, to fulfill the po\u00ad tential of each individual in our land. Nothing is more' fundamental to all we seek than our programs in health and education. Education-because it not only over\u00ad comes ignorance, but arms the citizen against the other evils which aftlict him. Health-because disease is the cruelest enemy of individual promise and be\u00ad cause medical progress makes less and less tolerable that illness still should blight so many lives. I. EDU~ATION I believe that future historians, when they point to the extraord~nary changes which have marked the 1960's, will iden\u00ad tify a major movement forward in Amer\u00ad ican education. This movement, spurred by the laws of the last 3 years, seeks to 'provide equality of educational opportunity to all Amer\u00ad icans-to give every child education of the highest quality, no matter how poor his family, how great his handicap, what color his skin, or where he lives. We cannot yet fully measure the re\u00ad sults of this great movement in Amer-\u00b7 ican education. Our progress can be traced partially by listing some of the ex\u00ad traordinary bills I have signed into law: The\u00b7 Higher Education Act of 1965. The Elementary and Secondary Edu\u00ad cation Act of 1964. The Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963. The Vocational Education Act of 1963. The scale of our efforts can be partially measured by the fact that today appro\u00ad priations for the Office of Education are nearly seven times greater than 4 years ago. Today we can point to at least 1 million college students who might not be in college except for Government loans, grants, and work-study programs, and to more than 17,500 school districts helping disadvantaged children under the Elementary and Secondary Educa\u00ad tionAct. This breakthrough is not the work of Washington alone. The ideas for these programs come from educational leaders all over the country. Many different communities must supply the energy to make these programs work. Yet they are national programs, shaped by national needs. Congress has played a vital role in reviewing these needs and setting these priorities. The new Federal role in education is, in reality, a new alliance with America's States and local communities. In this alliance, the Federal Government con\u00ad tinues to be a junior partner: Local school districts will submit, and State governments will approve, the plans for spending more than $1 billion this year to improve the education of poor children. Federal funds for vocational education are administered through State plans controlled by State, not Federal, officials. The recommendations of the States have been sought and followed in more than 95 percent of the .projects for cen\u00ad ters and services which are funded by the U.S. Office of Education. The education programs I recommend this year have three major aims: To strengthen the foundations we have laid in recent years, by revising, improv\u00ad ing, and consolidating existing programs. To provide special help to those groups in our society with special needs: the poor, the handicapped, victims of dis\u00ad crimination or neglect. To build for the future by exploiting the new opportunities presented by sci\u00ad ence, technology and the world beyond our borders. The budget proposals I am making for 1968 will carry forward our efforts at a new level. The total Federal dollar ex\u00ad penditures for educatjonal purposes, in\u00ad cluding health training, which I have proposed for fiscal 1968 will amount to $11 billion-an increase of $1 billion or 10 percent over 1967 and $7 billion, or 175 percent, over 1963. STRENGTHENING EDUCATION PROGRAMS State and community education lead\u00ad ers have shouldered heavy new burdens as a result of recent increases in Federal programs. If these officials are to de\u00ad velop wise and long-range plans for education, they must have more help. The Elementary and Secondary Edu\u00ad cation Act has provided funds to strengthen State departments of educa\u00ad tion. But additional funds are needed\u00ad money to improve community, State, and regional educational planning. Nothing can do more to insure the effective use of Federal dollars. I recommend legislation authorizing $15 million to help State and local gov\u00ad ernments evaluate their education pro\u00ad grams and plan for the future. A BETTER EDUCATION TIMETABLE \u00b7 One condition which severely hampers educational planning is the congressional schedule for authorizations and appro\u00ad priations. When Congress enacts and funds programs near the end of a ses\u00ad sion, the Nation's schools and colleges must plan their programs without know\u00ad ing what Federal resources will be available to them to meet their needs. As so many Governors have said, the Fed\u00ad eral legislative calendar often proves in\u00ad compatible with the academic calendar. I urge that the Congress enact educa\u00ad tion appropriations early enough to allow the Nation's schools and colleges to plan effectively. I have directed the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to work with the Congress toward this end. Another way to ease this problem is to seek the earliest practical renewal February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4641 of authorization for major educational measures. I recommend that Congress this year extend three major education measures now scheduled to expire in June 1968: The National Defense Education Act of 1958. The Higher Education Act of 1965. The National Vocational Student Loan Insurance Act of 1965. IMPROVING PROGRAM EVALUATION Most of our education programs have been operating too short a time to pro\u00ad vide conclusive judgments about their effectiveness. But we should be heart\u00ad ened by the evaluations so far. Recently, the National Advisory Coun\u00ad cil on the Education of Disadvantaged Children reported: The morale of teachers and administrators in schools with many poor children-their will to succeed \u00b7and their belief in the possi\u00ad bility of succeeding-is perceptibly on the rise in many of the schools visited. More teachers than ever are involved in an active search for paths to success. The paths are not all clearly visible as yet, but decidedly the search has taken on a new vigor. The council did identify problems and weaknesses in the school districts. OUr efforts to identify shortcomings and to assess our progress can never be fully effective until we provide sufficient re\u00ad sources for program evaluation. I have requested $2.5 million to assure careful analysis of new programs so that we can provide a full accounting to the Congress and the American people of our successes and shortcomings. THE EDUCATION PROFESSIONS ACT OF 1967 Our work to enrich education finds its focus in a single person: the classroom teacher, who inspires each student to achieve his best. Next year, more than 170,000 new teachers will be needed to replace un\u00ad certified teachers, to fill vacancies, and to meet rising student enrollments. More\u00ad over: There are severe shortages of English, mathematics, science, and elementary school teachers. More teachers are needed for our col\u00ad leges and junior colleges. Well-trained administrators at all levels are critically needed. New kinds of school personnel-such as teacher aids-are needed to help in the schools. By 1975, the Nation's schools will need nearly 2 million more new teachers. To help meet this growing demand, the Federal Government has sponsored a number of programs to train and im\u00ad prove teachers. These programs, though they have been effective, have been too fragmented to achieve their full potential and too limited to reach many essential sectors of the teaching profession. Teacher aids and school administrators have not been eligible to participate . We must develop a broader approa-eh to training for the education professions. At the State and local level, education authorities must have greater flexibility to plan for their educational manpower needs. I recommend the Education Profes\u00ad sions Act of 1967 to: CXIII--294-Part 4 Combine and expand many of the scattered statutory authorities for teacher training assistance. Provide new authority for the training of school administrators, teacher aids, and other education workers for schools and colleges. IMPROVING STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS In the Higher Education Act of 1965, Congress authorized a program to sup\u00ad port State guarantees for student loans made by banks and other lending in\u00ad stitutions. For students of modest means, the Federal Government also subsidizes the interest cost. The program has become an example of creative cooperation between the Fed\u00ad eral Government, the States, private financial institutions, and the academic community. Though it began in a time of tight credit, the program is off to a promising start. This year, it is expected that loans totaling $400 million will be made to nearly 480,000 students. By 1972, outstanding loans are expected to total $6.5 billion. I have asked all of the Government omcials concerned with the program\u00ad the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Budget, and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers-to review its operations in consultation with State and private or\u00ad ganizations concerned. If administrative changes in the pro\u00ad gram are necessary, we will make them. If any amendments to the legislation are in order, we will submit appropriate rec\u00ad ommendations to the Congress. SPECIAL PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL NEEDS EDUCATING POOR CHILDREN Over the past 2 years, we have in\u00ad vested more than $2.6 billion in improv\u00ad ing educational opportunities for more than 10 million poor children. This has been an ambitious venture, for no text\u00ad book offers precise methods for dealing with the disadvantaged. It has also been rewarding: we have generated new energy, gained new workers and devel\u00ad oped new skills in our effort to help the least fortunate. Dollars alone cannot do the job-but the job cannot be done without dollars. So let us continue the programs we have begun under Headstart and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Let us begin new efforts-like the Headstart followthrough program which we can carry forward into the early grades the gains made under Headstart. THE TEACHER CORPS Young as it is, the Teacher Corps has become a symbol of new hope for Amer\u00ad ica's poor children and their parents\u00ad and for hard-pressed school adminis\u00ad trators. More than 1,200 interns and veteran teachers have volunteered for demand\u00ad ing assignments in city and rural slums. Teacher Corps volunteers are at work in 275 schools throughout the country\u00ad helping children in 20 of our 25 largest cities, in Appalachia, in the Ozarks, in Spanish-speaking communities. The impact of these specialists goes far beyond their number. For they rep\u00ad resent an important idea-that the schools in our Nation's slums deserve a fair share of our Nation's best teach\u00ad ers. Mayors and school omcials across the country cite the competence, \u00b7the energy, and the devotion which Teacher Corps members are bringing to these tasks. Perhaps the best measure of the vi\u00ad tality of the Teacher Corps is the de\u00ad mand by school districts for volunteers and the number of young Americans who want to join. Requests from local schools exceed by far the number of vol\u00ad unteers we can now train. Ten times as many young Americans as we can presently accept--among them, some of our brightest college graduates-have applied for Teacher Corps service. The Teacher Corps, which I recom\u00ad mended and which the 89th Congress es\u00ad tablished, deserves the strong support of the 90th Congress. I recommend that the Teacher Corps be expanded to a total of 5,500 volun\u00ad teers by the school year beginning in September 1968. I propose amendments to enhance the role of the States in training and assign\u00ad ing Teacher\u00b7corps members. Finally, to finance next summer's training program, I strongly recommend early action on a supplemental appro\u00ad priation request of $12.5 m1llion for the Teacher Corps in fiscal year 1967. EDUCATING THE HANDICAPPED One child in 10 in our country is af\u00ad :fiicted with a handicap which, if left un\u00ad treated, severely cripples his chance to become a productive adult. In my message on children and youth, I proposed measures to bring better health care to these children-the men\u00ad tally retarded, the crippled, the chroni\u00ad cally ill. We must also give attention to their special educational needs. We must more precisely identify the techniques that will be effective in helping handi\u00ad capped children to learn. We need many more teachers who have the training essential to help these chil\u00ad dren. There are now only 70,000 special\u00ad ly trained teachers of the handicapped\u00ad a small fraction of the number the Na\u00ad tion requires. In the next decade, five times that number must be trained and put to work. I recommend legislation to: Establish regional resource centers to identify the educational needs of handi\u00ad capped children and help their parents and \u00b7teachers meet those needs. Recruit more men and women for ca\u00ad reers in educating the handicapped. Extend the service providing captioned films and other instructional materials for the deaf to all handicapped people. ENDING DISCRIMINATION Giving every American an equal chance for education requires that we put an end once and for all to racial segregation in our schools. In the Civil Rights Act of 1964, this Nation committed itself to eliminating segregation. Yet patterns of discrimi\u00ad nation are still entrenched in many com\u00ad munities, North and South, East and West. 4642 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 If equal opportunity is to be more than a slogan in our society, every State and community mu~t , be encouraged to face up to this legal anQ. moral responsibility. I have requested $30 million-nearly a fourfold increase over this year's ap\u00ad propriation.:...:....to provide the needed re\u00ad \u00a7Ources un,der title IV of the Civil Rights Act to help States and communities face the problems of school desegregation. EPUCATION FOR THE WORLD OF WORK \u00b7 Three out of 10 students in 'America dl!OP out before completing high school. Only two out of 10 of our Nation's youp.g men -and women receive college degrees. J Too few of these young people get the training and guidance they need to find good jobs. \u00b7 I recommend legislation to aid second\u00ad ary schools\u00b7 and colleges to develop new programs in vocational education, to make work part of the learning exp~ri\u00ad ence and to \u00b7provide career-counseling for their students. ~ A number of our colleges have\u00b7 highly successful -programs of cooperative edu\u00ad cation which permit students to vary periods of study with periods of employ\u00ad ment. This is an important educational mnovation that'has demonstrated its ef\u00ad fectiveness. It should be' applied more widely in our schools and universities. I recommend an amendment of the college we'rk-study program which will for the first time permit us to support cooperative education projects. I am also requesting the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Secreta:cy \u00b7 of Labor to use Neighbor\u00ad hood Youth Corps func;is at the high school level for this purpose. COMBATING ADULT ILLITERACY At \u00b7least 3 million adults in America cannot read or write. Another \u00b713 mil\u00ad lion have less than an eighth-grade edu\u00ad cation. Many of these citizens lack the basic learning to . cope with the toutin,e business of daily life. : \u00b7 This is a national tragedy and an eco\u00ad nomic -loss for which each one of us must pay. The Adult Education Act, enactecllast year; is our pledge to help eliminate this needless loss of human talent. . This year, I am requeEi\"ting $44 mil\u00ad lion-an increase of nearly '50 percent\u00ad for education programs. . 't'hese funds will help 'new projects; sponsored by both public agencies and nonprofit private groups, to train 'Volun\u00ad teers for work in adult-literacy programs and to establish neighborhood education programs . reaching beyond the_ form~l classroom. BUILDING FOR TOMORI,tOW 1 _PUBLIC TELEVISIQN \u00b7 _In 1951, tbe Federal Communications Commission set aside the :first \u00b7 242 tele\u00ad vision ~channels . for noncommercial bro~dcasting, dec,laring: _ The public interest will be clearly served if these stations contribute significantly to the educational process of the Nation .. The first educational television station went on the air in May '1953. Today, there are 178\u00b7 noncomme .rcial television stations ~m the air or under construc\u00ad tion. Since 1963 the Federal Govern\u00ad ment has provided $32 million under the Educational Television Fac111ties Act to help build towers, transmitters, and other ~acilities. These funds have helped sta\u00ad tions with an estimated potential audi\u00ad ence of close to 150 million citizens. .Yet we have only begun to grasp the great promise of this medium, which, in the words of one critic, has the power to \"arouse our dreams, satisfy our hunger for beauty, take us. on journeys, enable us to participate in events, present great drama and music, explore the sea and the sky and the winds and the hills.\" Noncommercial . television can.bring its audience the e.xchement of excellence in every field. I am convinced 'that \u00b7a vital and self-sufficient .noncommercial tele:\u00b7 vision system wtil, .only in'struct, our~people. - Practi~allY all, nonC()mrile;rci~l st~ .tic.ms have serious shortages of the facilities, equipment, money, and staff they need to present programs of high quality. There are not en6ugh stations. Inter\u00ad connections between stations are il'lade\u00ad quate !tnd seldom \u00b7permit \u00b7the timely scheduling of current programs. Noncommercial television today is reaching only a fraction of its potential audience--and achieving only a fraction of its potential worth. \u00b7 \u00b7 Clearly, the time has come to build oh the experience of the past 14 years, the important studies that have been made, and the beginnings we have made. \u00b7 I recommend that Congress enact the Public Television Act of 1967 to: Increase Federal funds for television and radio facility construction to $10.5 million in fiscal 1968, more than three times this year's approprjations. Create a Corporation for Public\u00b7 Tele\u00ad vision authorized to provide support to noncommercial television and radio. Provide $9 million in fiscal 1968 as initial funding for the Corporation. Next year, after\u00b7 careful review, I will make further proposals for the Corpora- tion's long-term ':financing. \u00b7 \u00b7 . Noncommercial \u00b7 television and radio in America, everi though supported by Federal funds, must be absolutely free from any Federal-Government interfer\u00ad ence over programing: . As I said ih the state of the Union message: We should insist that the public interest be tully serv.ed through the public's airwaves. T~e boar\u00a21 of dlr~qtors of include American le'aders in,.ed.ucation:, commu\u00ad nications, and the creative arts. \u00b7 I rec\u00ad ommend that the board be comprised of 15 members, apPointed by the President and confirmed by the Se~ate. The Corporation would provide sup\u00ad port to establish production centers and to help local stations improve their pro\u00ad ficiency.\u00b7 It would be authorized to ac\u00ad cept funds from other sources, public and private. ' \u00b7 The\u00b7. strength of .public television should lie in its diversity. Every region and every community should be chal\u00ad lenged to contribute its best. Other opportunities for the\u00b7 Corppra- \u00b7 tion exist to support vocational training for young people who desire careers in\u00b7 public television, to foster research iand' development, and\u00b7 to\u00b7 explore new ways to serve the'viewingpublic. \u00b7.One of the Corpdratton's :first tasks should be to study the practicality and the economic advantages of using com\u00ad munication satellites to establish an edu\u00ad cational television and radio network. To assist the Corporation, I am direct\u00ad ing the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to conduct experiments on the requirements for such a system, and for instructional television .: ln coopera\u00ad tion with other interested agencies of the Government arid the private sector. Formulation of long-range policies concerning the future of satellite com\u00ad !!lunications tive branch and the Congress. I antici\u00ad pate that the appropriate committeeS of Congress will hold hearings to consider these comple~ issues of public policy. The executiv~ branch will carefully study these hearings as -we shape our recom\u00ad inendatiqns .. INSTRUCTIONAL TELEVISION I ~ecommend legislation to authorize the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to launch 1 a\u00b7 major study of the values and the p;romise of instructional television which is being used more and more widely in our classrooms, but whose P?tentia~ has not been fully developed. COMPUTERS \" IN EDUCATION In my 1968 budget, I propose that the National Science Foundation be given new resources to advance man's knowl\u00ad edge and serve the Nation. Its endeavors will help our scholars better to under\u00ad stand the atmosphere, exploit the ocean's riches, probe the behavior and the nature of man. The Foundation will also step up its pioneer work to develop new teaching materials for our schools and colleges. The new math and the new science are only the first fruits of this innovative work. One equcational resource holds excit\u00ad ing'promise for America's classrooms: the electronic computer. Computers areal\u00ad ready at work in educational institutions, primarily to assist the most advanced re\u00ad search. The computer can serve other educational purposes--if we find ways to employ it eij'e-<;:tively and economically and if we develop practical courses to teach students how to use it. \u00b7 I .have directed the National Science Foundation working with the U.S. Office of Education to establish an experimen\u00ad tal prog:J;\"am for developing the potential of,co~putersin educ~tion. \u00b7-ENRICHING THE ARTS, AND THE HUMANITIES \"Our progress will not be limited\u00b7 to scientific advances. The National Foun\u00ad dation on the .Arts and the Humanities, established in 1965, has already begun to bring.new cultural and scholarly spirit to our scho.ols and communities. State arts councils, museums, theaters, and orches\u00ad tras have received not only new funds but new energy and enthusiasm through the National Endowment for the Arts. . The National Endowment for the Hu\u00ad manities ha.s made grants to support' new :Q:istorlcal studies of our Nation's herit\u00ad age, to encourage creative teaching in our colleges, to offer outstanding young scholars opportunities for advancement. I recommend that Congress appro\u00ad priate for the National Foundation on the February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4643 Arts and Humanities $16 million-an in\u00ad crease of nearly one-third. HIGHER EDUCATION FOR INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING For many years, America's colleges and universities have prepared men and women for careers involving travel, trade, and service abroad. Today, when our world responsibilities are greater than ever before, our domestic institutions of higher learning need .more support for their programs of international studies. The 89th Congress, in its closing days, passed the International Education Act-an historic measure recognizing this Nation's enduring belief that learn\u00ad ing must transcend geographic bound\u00ad aries. Through a program of grants un\u00ad der the act, America's schools, colleges, and universities can add a world di\u00ad mension to their students' learning experience. I urge the Congress to approve promptly my forthcoming request for a supplemental appropriation of $350,000 for the International Education Act, to :Permit necessary planning for next year's program, as well as an appropriation of $20 million for fiscal 1968. \u00b7 ll. HEALTH No great age of discovery in history can match our own time. Today, our wealth, our knowledge, our scientific genius give us the power to prolong man's life-and to prevent the erosion of life by illness. In 1900, an American could expect to live only 49 years. Today, his life ex\u00ad pectancy has been increased to 70 years. These advances are the result of spec\u00ad tacular progress in research, in public health, in the medical arts. We have developed: Sufficient knowledge to end nearly all of the hazards of childbirth and pregnancy. \u00b7Modern nutrition to wipe out such ail\u00ad ments as rickets, goiter, and pellagra .. Vaccines, antibiotics and modern drugs to control many of the killers and crip\u00ad plers of yesterday: polio) diphtheria pneumonia. ' New medical and surgical techniques to combat cancer and cardiovascular disease. Lifesaving devices: plastic heart valves, and artificial artery transplants. In 1967, to pursue this vital work, the Federal Government is investing more than $440 million in the construction of health facilities, $620 million for health manpower education and training, $1.3 billion in biomedical research, $7.8 billion to proVide medical care. But each gain, each victory, should focus our attention more sharply on the unfinished business facing this Nation in the field of health: Infant mortality is far higher than it need be. Handicaps afflicting many children are discovered too late or left itntreate(l. Grave deficiencies remain 1n health care. for the pdor, the handicapped and the chronically ill. American men between the ages of 45 and 54-which should be the most pro\u00ad ductive years of their lives-have a death rate twice that of men of the same age in a number of advanced coimtrles. We' still search in vain for ways to prevent and treat many forms of cancer. Many types of mental illness, retarda\u00ad tion, arthritis and heart disease are still largely beyond our control. Our national resources for health have grown, but our national aspirations have grown faster. Today we expect what yesterday we could not have envisioned\u00ad adequate medical care for every citizen. My health proposals to the 90th Con\u00ad gress have four basic aims: To expand our knowledge of dise,ase and our research and development of better ways to deliver health care to every American; To build our health resources, by stepped-up training of health workers and by improved planning of health facilities; To remove barriers to good medical care for those who most need care; To strengthen our partnership for health by encouraging regional, state, and local efforts-public and private\u00ad to develop comprehensive programs serving ,all our citizens. . HEALTH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: THE FOUNDATION OF OUR EFFORTS SUPPORTING BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH Our progress in health grows out of a research effort unparalleled anywhere in the world. The scientists of the Na\u00ad tional Institutes of Health have shaped an alliance throughout the N,ation to find the causes and the cures of disease. We must build on the strong ba.se of past research achievements, exchange ideas with scholars and students from ,all parts of the world, and apply our knowl\u00ad edge more swiftly and effectively. We must take advantage of our prog\u00ad ress in targeted research as we h.a ve done in our vaccine development program, in. the heart drug study, in artificial kidney and kidney tran.Splant research, and in the treatment of specific types of c.ancer. In the 1968 budget, I am recommend\u00ad ing an increase of $65 million-to an an\u00ad nual total of almost $1.5 billion-to sup- port biomedical research. \u00b7 I am seeking funds to establish an In\u00ad tern,ational Center for Advanced Study in the Health Seience.s and to provide scholarships and fellowships in the Center. I am directing the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to appoint im\u00ad mediately a lung cancer task force to supplement the continuing work of 'ex\u00ad isting task forces on leukemfa, cancer chemotherapy, uterine cancer, solid tumor, and breast cancer. HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT America's annual spending for health and medical care is more than $43 bil\u00ad lion. But despite this .invel:)tment, our system of providing health services is not operating as efficiently and effective\u00ad ly as it should. In some U.S. counties infant mortality rates, one yardstick of health care, are 300 percent: higher than the national average. \u00b7 Seventy percent of automobile acci\u00ad dent deaths occur in communities of less than 2,500 people, where medical fa- cilities are often poorest. Even though we have good techniques for detecting and curing cervical can\u00ad eer, 8,000 women die each year for lack of proper care. \u00b7 Emergency rooms in U.S. hospitals are, seriously overcrowded, not with actual emergency cases, but with people who cannot find normal outpatient care any\u00ad where else. Research and development could help eliminate these conditions by pointing the way to better delivery of health care. Yet the Government-wide total invest\u00ad ment in health service research amounts to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of our total annual investment in health care. We have done very little to mobilize American universities, industry, private practitioners, and research institutions to seek new ways of providing medical services. There have been few experiments in applying advanced methods-systems analysis and automation, for example\u00ad to problems of health care. Our superior research techniques have brought us new knowledge in health and medicine. These same techniques must now be put to work in the effort to bring low cost, quality health care to our citi\u00ad zens. We must marshal the Nation's best minds to: Design hospitals, nursing homes and group practice facilities which provide effective care with the most efficient use of funds and manpower; Develop new ways of assisting doctors to reach more people with good health services; Devise new patterns of health services. To begin this effort, I have directed the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish a National Center for Health Services Research and De\u00ad velopment. I recommend legislation to expand health services research and make pos\u00ad sible the fullest use of Federal hospitals as research centers to improve health care. I also recommend an appropriation of $20 million to the Department of Health Education, and Welfare in 1968, for re~ searc:Jt and development in health serv\u00ad ices-nearly twice as much as in 1967. DEVELOPING MANPOWER AND FACILITIES FOR \" HEALTH HEALTH MANPOWER The United States is facing a serious shortage of health manpower. Within the\u00b7 next decade this Nation will nee.d 1 million more health workers. If we are to meet this. need, we must develop new skills and new types of health work\u00ad ers. We need short-term training pro\u00ad grams for medical aids and other health workers; we need programs to develop 1Ph~sicians' assistants, and speed the traming of health professions. We also need to make effective use of the thou\u00ad sands of medical corpsmea trained in the Armed Forces who return to civilian life each year. Last May, I appointed a National Ad\u00ad visory Commission on Health Manpower to recommend how we can: Speed the education of doctors and other health personnel without sacrific\u00ad ing the quality of training; Improve the use of health manpower both in and outside the Government. \u00b7. Meanwhile, I directed members of my Cabinet to intensify their efforts to re\u00ad lieve\u00b7 health manpower shortages 4644 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 through Federal programs. This week they reported to me that federally sup\u00ad ported programs in 1967 will train 224,000 health workers-an increase of nearly 100,000 over 1966. Thirty thou\u00ad sand previously inactive nurses and technicians will be given refresher train\u00ad ing this year. \u00b7 Through the teamwork of Federal and State agencies, professional organiza\u00ad tions, and educational institutions, we have launched a major effort to provide facilities and teachers for this immense training mission. To maintain this stepped-up training already started in fiscal year 1967, I am recommending expenditures of $763 mil\u00ad lion-a 22-percent increase for fiscal year 1968-to expand our health man\u00ad power resources. PLANNING FOR FUTURE HEALTH FACILITIES Over the past two decades, the Hill\u00ad Burton program has assisted more than 3,400 communities to build hospitals, nursing homes and other health care centers. Hill-Burton funds have helped to provide 350,000 hospital and nursing home beds, and to bring modern medical services to millions of Americans. The authorization for this program expires on June 30, 1969. The contribution of the Federal Government in financing construction of health facilities has changed, especially with the beginning of medicare, medicaid, and other new programs. It is timely, therefore, that we take a fresh look at this area. I am appointing a National Advisory Commission on Health Facilities to study our needs for the total system of health facilities--hospitals, extended care fa\u00ad cilities, nursing homes, long-term care institutions, and clinics. In addition to considering the future of the Hill-Burton program, the Commission will make rec\u00ad ommendations for financing the con\u00ad struction and modernization of health facilities. ELIMINATING BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE In previous messages to Congress this year, I have made recommendations to: Extend medicare to 1.5 million seri\u00ad ously disabled Americans under age 65. Establish new health services through broader maternal and child health pro\u00ad grams; a. strengthened crippled chil\u00ad dren's program, and new projects in child health and dental care. Improve medical services for the needy under medicaid. Combat mental retardation by sup\u00ad porting construction of university and community centers for the mentally re\u00ad tarded, and for the first time, helping to staff the community centers. Guarantee the safety of medical de\u00ad vices and laboratory tests by requiring Food and Drug Administvation preclear\u00ad ance of devices, and by requiring li\u00ad censing of clinical laboratories in inter- state commerce. We must aot in other ways to ove\u00b7r\u00ad come barriers to health care. The Office of Economic Opportunity has developed a program of Neighbor\u00ad hood Health Centers which not only bring modern medical care to the poor but also train citizens for jobs in the health field. - Last year, Congress endorsed this new approach and authorized funds for 24 such centers. More are needed. I am requesting the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity to en\u00ad courage communities to establish addi\u00ad tional centers. Our goal will be to double the number of centers in fiscal 1968. In the past 4 years, we have launched a new program to attack mental illness through community mental health cen\u00ad ters. This program is now well un\u00ad derway. More centers are needed, and we must strengthen and expand exist\u00ad ing services. I recommend legislation to extend and improve the Community Mental Health Centers Act. Among the most tragically neglected of our citizens are those who are both deaf and blind. More than 3,000 Ameri\u00ad cans today face life unable to see and hear. To help reach the deaf-blind with the best programs our experts can devise, I recommend legislation to establish a Na\u00ad tional Center for the Deaf and Blind. ENDING HOSPITAL DISCRIMINATION With the launching of the medicare program last July, the Nation took a major step toward ending racial segre\u00ad gation in hospitals. More than 95 percent of the Nation's hospitals have already complied with the antidiscrimination requirements of the medicare legislation. They are guaran\u00ad teeing that there will be no \"second\u00ad class patients\" in our health-care insti\u00ad tutions; that all citizens can enter the same door, enjoy the same facilities and the same quality of treatment. We will continue to work for progress in this field-until equality of treatment is the rule not in some, but in all of our hospitals and other health facilities. RISING MEDICAL COSTS In 1950, the average cost per patient per day in a hospital was $14.40. In 1965, this cost more than tripled to over $45. Other health costs have also risen sharply in recent years. Last August, I asked the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to initi\u00ad ate a study of medical costs. This study, now completed, indicates that medical oosts will almost certainly continue to rise. It emphasizes the absolute neces\u00ad sity of using medic,al resources more effi\u00ad ciently if we are to moderate this in\u00ad crease in the cost of health care. This is a job for everyone who plays a part in providing or financing medical care-the medical profession, the hos\u00ad pital industry, insurance carriers, State and local governments and many other private and public groups. Federal pro\u00ad grams must also play a role in promoting cost consciousness in medical care. The new National Center for Health Services Research and Development will develop ways to make our .medical sys\u00ad tems more efficient. The Center's first assignment will be to develop new ways to improve the use of professional and auxiliary health workers--a key factor in reducing hospital costs. We can take other steps. I am directing Secretary John Gard\u00ad ner to Convene, at the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, a Na\u00ad tional Conference on Medical Costs. This Conference will bring together leaders of the medical community and members of the public to discuss how we can lower the costs of medical services without impairing the quality. In the weeks and months ahead, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare will consult with representatives of the medical profession, universities, business, and labor to: Find practical incentives for the effec\u00ad tive operation of hospitals and other health facilities. Reduce the costs of construction and speed the moderniZ<ation of hospitals, nursing homes, and extended care fa\u00ad cilities. Support those innovations in medical education which will lead to better training programs and promote the effi\u00ad cient practice of medicine. OUR PARTNERSHIP FOR HEALTH The partnership for health legislation, enacted by the 89th Congress, is designed to strengthen State and local programs and to encourage broad-gage planning in health. It gives the states new flexibil\u00ad ity to use Federal funds by freeing them from tightly compartmentalized grant programs. It also allows the States to attack special health problems which have special regional or local impact. I recommend that Congress extend the partnership for health legislation for 4 years; provide supplemental appropria\u00ad tions for planning in fiscal19{;7 million-an in\u00ad crease of $41 million-in fiscal 1968. Our regional medical programs for heart disease, cancer, and stroke depend on a second partnership, involving doc\u00ad tors, medical schools, hospitals, and State and local health departments. These programs will bring to every citi\u00ad zen the fruits of our Nation's research into the killer diseases. They will also promote the continuing education of the Nation's doctors, nurses, and other health workers. To sustain these nationwide programs, I recommend an appropriation of $64 million for fiscal 1968-an increase of $19 million over 1967. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY Occupational health and safety is an\u00ad other area in which we need to strength\u00ad en our partnership with labor, industry, medicine, and government. In 1965, more than 14,000 job-con\u00ad nected deaths and 2 million disabling work injuries caused untold misery and privation to workers, 230 million lost man-days of production, and billions of dollars in lost income. We must learn more about the nature of job-connected injuries, so we can set e1fective safety standards and develop better protective measures. I am recommending in the 1968 budget an appropriation for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare of $8.1 million-a 25-percent increase over this year-to expand research and training programs in occupational health, and to strengthen State and local public health programs in this field. I am directing the Secretary of Labor to improve and strengthen health pro\u00ad tection and safety standards for work\u00ad ers through cooperative Federal-State programs. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4645 m. TO FULFILL THE INDIVIDUAL As a people, we have wanted many things, achieved many things. We have become the richest, the mightiest, the most productive nation in the world. Yet a nation may accumulate dollars, grow in power, pile stone on stone-and still fall short of greatness. The meas\u00ad ure of a people is not how much they achieve-but what they achieve. Which of our pursuits is most worthy of our devotion? If we were required to choose, I believe we would place one item at the top of the list: fulfillment of the individual. If that is what we seek, mere wealth and power cannot help us. \u00b7 We must also act--in definable and practical ways-to liberate each individual from conditions which stunt his growth, as\u00ad sault his dignity, diminish his spirit. Those enemies we know: ignorance, ill\u00ad ness, want, squalor, tyranny, injustice. To fulfill the individual-this is the purpose of my proposals. They present an opportunity-and an obligation-to the 90th Congress. I hope and believe this Congress will live up to the high expectations of a pro\u00ad gressive and humanitarian America. LYNDON B.

CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS OF SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my colleague from South Carolina [Mr. THURMOND], I ask unanimous consent to have inserted in the RECORD two resolutions recently adopted by both houses of the South Carolina General Assembly requesting the Secretary of Agriculture to provide for more loose leaf tobacco sales on South Carolina markets in 1967. The concurrent resolutions were re\u00ad ferred to the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, as follows: A CoNCURRENT RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE U.S. SECRETA)!Y OF AGRICULTURE TO PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF LOOSE LEAF TOBACCO IN SOUTH CAROLINA Whereas, the offices of the Governor of South Carolina and the Commissioner of Agriculture for South Carolina have recently conducted a farm to farm survey among the tobacco producers in South Carolina to as\u00ad certain the wishes of the growers as to the marketing of loose leaf sales for the 1967 flue-cured tobacco crop; and Whereas, the questionnaire or survey sheets returned represent growers of 71,428.47 acres, out of a total allotmenrt; of 77,000 acres of tobacco planted in South Carolina for the farm year 1966; and Whereas, the recent survey figures reveal ninety per cent of the South Carolina to\u00ad bacco growers favor a full season of loose lea! sales, nine per cent favor a split season of loose leaf and tied tobacco, four\u00ad tenths of one per cent favor a full season of all tied tobacco and six-tenths of one. per cent expressed no preference, and . Whereas, the South Carolina tobacco growers and others deem it unwise to force loose lea! stocks on export markets until such markets have had time to arrange for storage facilities and equipment for handling loose leaf stocks. Now, therefore, Be it resolved by the Senate, the House of Represen ta ti ves concurring: That the Honorable Orville Freeman, United States Gecretary of Agriculture, is requested that loose leaf sales of tobacco in South Carolina be permitted for the 1967 flue-cured tobacco crop and that sales be slowed down to the point where congestion would not develop.

Be it further resolved, that copies of this resolution be forwarded to the Honorable Orville Freeman, to the Chairman of the Pub\u00ad lic Hearing scheduled to be held in Marlon, South Carolina, on Monday, February 20, 1967, to the Governor of South Carolina, to the Commissioner of \u00b7Agriculture for-South Carolina and to members of the United States Senate and members of Congress from South Carolina. A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE U.S. SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE To PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF LOOSE LEAF TOBACCO IN SOUTH CAROLINA Whereas, the offices of the Governor of South Carolina and the Commissioner of Ag\u00ad riculture for South Carolina have recently conducted a farm to farm survey among the tobacco producers in South carolina to ascertain the wishes of the growers as to the marketing of loose leaf sales for the 1967 fiue-cuTed tobacco crop; and Whereas, the questionnaire or survey sheets returned represent growers of 71,- 428.47 acres, out of a total allotment of 77,000 acres of tobacco planted in South Carolina for the farm year 1966; and Whereas, the recent survey figures reveal ninety per cent of the South Carolina to\u00ad bacco growers favor a full season of loose leaf sales, nine per cent favor a split season of loose leaf and tied tobacco, four-tenths of one per cent favor a full season of all tied tobacco and six-tenths of one per cent expressed no preference; and Whereas, the South Carolina tobacco grow-' ers and others deem it unwise to force loose leaf stocks on export markets until 'such markets have had time to arrange for stor\u00ad age facilities and equipment for handling loose leaf stocks: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring, That the' Honorable Orville Freeman, U.S. Secretary of Agri-_ culture, is requested that loose leaf sales of tobacco in South Carolina be per\u00ad mitted for the 1967 flue-cured tobacco crop and that sales be slowed down to the point where congestion would n.ot develop; be it further Resolved, that a combination of loose leaf and tied tobacco sales be permitted and that the price support be provided on all grades of tobacco; be it further Resolved, That copies-of this Resolution be forwarded to the Honorable Orville.

Edward White Rawlins, U.S. Navy <retired)\" to the Chief Commis\u00ad sioner of the Court of Claims for a report thereon, which was referred to the Com\u00ad mittee on the Judiciary. <See the above resolution printed in full when submitted by Mr. TYDINGS, which appears under a separate head\u00ad ing.) TO PROHffiiT THE SLAUGHTERING OF ELK IN YELLOWSTONE NA\u00ad TIONAL PARK Mr. HANSEN submitted a resolution <S. Res. 91) prohibiting the slaughtering of elk in Yellowstone National Park, which was referred to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. <See the above resolution printed in full when submitted by Mr. HANSEN, which appears under a separate head\u00ad ing.) FEDERAL OFFENSE TO INCITE OR PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN RIOTS Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, I send to the desk a bill, and ask that it be ap\u00ad propriately referred. The bill contemplates making it a Federal offense for persons promoting or participating in a riot which in any man\u00ad ner interferes with the free flow of inter\u00ad state commerce. It also provides that if there is any interference with firemen in the performance of their duties in ex\u00ad tinguishing fires, as an incident of an interference with interstate commerce, such action shall likewise constitute criminal misconduct in violation of Fed\u00ad eral law. My bill has its origin in thought in the instances where interstate commerce has been blocked by rioters and inci\u00ad dentally interfering with firemen at\u00ad tempting to extinguish fires caused by the riot. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately referred. The bill <S. 1094) to make it a Federal offense to incite or participate in a riot which impairs interstate or fo.reign com\u00ad merce or to interfere with a fireman or law enforcement officer who is perform\u00ad ing official duties incident to and during such a rio.t, and for other purposes, in\u00ad troduced by Mr. LAuscHE (for himself and other Senators), was received, read twice by its title, and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. \u00b7 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if the Senator from Ohio has no objection, that my name be added as a cosponsor of the bill. Mr. LAUSCHE. Yes; I am glad to have the Senator as a cosponsor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name also be added as a cosponsor of the bill. Mr. LAUSCHE. With the consent of the Senate, I would also like to have the Senator from Delaware become a co\u00ad sponsor of the bill, as he has indicated. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. ESTABLISHMENT OF WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT NATIONAL HIS\u00ad TORIC SITE Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, I in\u00ad troduce a bill for appropriate reference. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately re\u00ad ferred. The bill (S. 1095) to provide for the establishment of the William Howard Taft National Historic Site, introduced by Mr. LAuscHE, was received, read twice by its title, and referred to the Commit\u00ad tee on Rules and Administration. Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, the purpose of the bill is to have the birth\u00ad place of William Howard\u00b7 Taft declared to be a national historic site. This dis\u00ad tinguished Ohioan occupied the office of the Presidency and was also a Chief Jus\u00ad tice of the United States. There is no adequate memorial in honor of former President William How\u00ad ard Taft. The Taft family has now ac\u00ad quired control of the Alphonso Taft house, where William Howard Taft was born in 1857. The father of William Howard Taft, Alphonso Taft, was a dis\u00ad tinguished American. He was a leading judge in Ohio. He was Secretary of War and Attorney General under President Grant and also Minister to Austria and Russia. The family, through a nonprofit corpo\u00ad ration, the William Howard Taft Memo\u00ad rial Association, has, with its own fi\u00ad nances, restored a part of the old house, but has encountered insurmountable bar\u00ad riers. It is for that reason that I have introduced the bill. TEHAMA-COLUSA CANAL ENLARGEMENT Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, I in\u00ad troduce, for appropriate reference, a bill to enlarge positions of the Tehama\u00ad Colusa Canal to allow it to serve ade\u00ad quately the Central Valley project as presently planned. The Central Valley project, in my State of California, was designed to bring water to the Sacra\u00ad mento and San Joaquin Valleys. The Tehama-Colusa Canal, when completed, will run from Red Bluff in Tehama County to a point near the boundaries of Colusa and Yolo .Counties, a distance of some 126 miles. As presently proposed, the canal will be adequate only to serve the area origi\u00ad nally planned. However, the proposed West Sacramento Valley project, when authorized and built, will provide serv-February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4649 ice to the counties of Yolo and Solano, which lie south of the present area served. The water for this new worth\u00ad while project will travel the same route as the Tehama-Colusa Canal. It will travel in the Tehama-Colusa if that con\u00ad duit is enlarged, in accordance .with the legislation introduced today, to be able to handle the added capacity. If it is not enlarged, an entirely new canal will have to be constructed parallel to the Te\u00ad hama-Colusa Canal. The folly of this approach is apparent. My bill will allow the Secretary of the Interior to enlarge the capacity and ad\u00ad just the elevation of the Tehama-Colusa Canal to provide service to the addi\u00ad tional areas to be served by the West Sacramento Valley project when com\u00ad pleted. This approach wlll have con\u00ad struction costs, as well as reducing the amount of land which would be taken off the local tax rolls by virtue of construct\u00ad ing a parallel canal. In this way the local area will be doubly served. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bUl will be received and appropriately re\u00ad ferred; and, without objection, the bill will be printed in the REcORD as re\u00ad quested by the Senator from California. The bill <S. 1098) to amend the act of September 26, 1950, authorizing the Sacramento Valley irrigation canals, Central Valley project, California, in or\u00ad der to increase the capacity of certain project features for future irrigation of additional lands, introduced by Mr. KucHEL, was received, read twice by its title, referred to the Committee on In\u00ad terior and Insular Affairs, and ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: S.1098 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That section 2 of the Act entitled \"An Act to authorize Sacramento Valley irrigation canals, Central Valley project California,\" approved Septem\u00ad ber 26, 1950 (64 Stat. 1036), is amended by adding to the first paragraph of that section the following: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5 of this Act, the Secre\u00ad tary of the Interior is authorized to provide sufficient extra capadty and elevation in the Tehama-Colusa Canal to enable future water service to Yolo, Solano, Lake, and Napa Counties for irrigation and other purposes, and to treat the cost of providing such extra capacity as a deferred obligation. The de\u00ad ferred obligation is to be paid under arrange\u00ad ments to be made at such time as the works to serve the additional areas may be author\u00ad ized as an extension of the Central Valley project. In the event such works are not authorized, the deferred obligation is to be paid from other revenues of the Central Valley project.\" FIVE-POINT PREFERENCE ON CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATIONS TO CER\u00ad TAIN VETERANS Mr. MciNTYRE. Mr. President, I in\u00ad troduce, for appropriate reference, a bill to provide meaningful and statutory five-point veterans preference for those veterans who were supposedly given this preference already by the Veterans Re\u00ad adjustment Benefits Act of 1966. The background and need for this bill CXIII--295-Part 4 can be simply explained. In the last Congress we enacted the Veterans Re\u00ad adjustment Benefits Act of 1966, which purported to give those cold war vet\u00ad erans who had served for 180 or more consecutive days after July 1, 1955, pref\u00ad erence on civil service examinations under the Veterans Preference Act of 1944, as amended. The 1966 act did provide preference for cold war veterans. It did not specify how this preference was to be granted. On March 2, 1966, after the bill had been sent to the President for his signa\u00ad ture, but before it was signed, the Civil Service Commission issued its Federal Personnel Manual Letter 211-3, which dealt with the problem posed by the new legislation. The Commission ruled that the newly covered veterans would re\u00ad ceive, by regulation, as opposed to legis\u00ad lation, the same five-point preference which was already given by statute to other preference eligibles. What the bill that I am introducing today does is to grant by statute what is presently being granted by regulation. I believe that the veterans of the cold war, including those now :fighting in Southeast Asia, deserve the same treat\u00ad ment which was extended to their prede\u00ad cessors on the battlefields of Korea, and World War I and II. I believe that our veterans laws will be more consistent and logical if we extend this five-point preference by statute, as we have done for all previous veterans, and not have some benefits conferred by statute and others by regulation. Finally, I believe that our cold war vet\u00ad erans will feel more secure in their rights if they need not rely upon a simple regulation of a Government agency, but are able to rest assured that their rights are spelled out in the law of the land. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately referred. The bill <S. 1100) to amend title 5, United States Code, so as to give a five\u00ad point preference on civil service exam\u00ad inations to veterans who served in the Armed Forces after July 1, 1955, and for other purposes, introduced by Mr. MciNTYRE, was received, read twice by its title, and referred to the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIA\u00ad TIONS FOR THE SALINE CONVER\u00ad SION PROGRAM Mr. JACKSON. Mr. President, by re\u00ad quest I introduce for appropriate refer\u00ad ence, a bill to authorize appropriations and expand the program for saline water conversion. The program which was authorized un\u00ad der the act of July 3, 1952, dealt pri\u00ad marily with basic research. The basic research must continue, but the success of the program indicates we must now move ahead with testing and practical application. To do this, we must expand the exist\u00ad ing program its authorization for the fis\u00ad cal years 1968 through 1970. Fifteen years ago it cost an estimated $5 per thousand gallons to convert salt water into fresh water. Today, this can be done for 40 cents per thousand in moderately large plants. In larger, dual\u00ad purpose plants such. as the proposed Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, this could be accomplished for 25 cents per thousand. Mr. President, this is an area of great promise in the solution of our water shortage problem. I request that the letter from the Secretary of Interior re\u00ad questing this legislation, and the text of the proposed bill, appear in the RECORD. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately re\u00ad ferred; and, without objection, the bill and letter will be printed in the RECORD. The bill <S. 1101) to authorize appro\u00ad priations for the saline water conversion program, to expand the program, and for other purposes, introduced by Mr. JACKSON, was received, read twice by its title, referred to the Committee on In\u00ad terior and Insular Affairs, and ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 1101 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Act of July 3, 1952 (66 Stat. 328), as amend\u00ad ed (42 U.S.C.l961 et seq.), is hereby further amended as follows: (a) In section 8 substitute \"$188,082,000, plus such additional sums as the Congress may hereafter authorize and appropriate but not to exceed $86,918,000,\" in lieu of $90,- 000,000, plus such additional sums as the Congress may hereafter authorize and ap\u00ad propriate but not to exceed $185,000,000,\". (b) In subsection 2 (b) add the words \"test bed,\" after the word \"laboratory,\". (c) At the end of subsection 2(b) add the following: \"the five demonstration plants authorized by the joint resolution of September 2, 1958 (72 Stat. 1706), as amended (42 U.S.C. 1958 (d) ) , shall hereafter be regarded as test beds subject to the provisions of this Act. The provisions of sections 3 and 6 of such joint resolution, and those provisions of sec\u00ad tion 4 relating to the method of disposal and disposition of the proceeds of sale shall also continue to be applicable to them;\". (d) In subsection 2 (c) insert the word \"prototype\" and delete the world \"demon\u00ad stration\". (e) By adding a new section 9 to read as follows: \"This Act may be cited as the 'Saline Water Conversion Act'.\" The letter presented by Mr. JACKSON is as follows: U.S. DEPARTMEWT OF THE INTERIOR, OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, Washington, D.C., February 27, 1967. Hon. HUBERT H. HUMPHREY, President of the Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Enclosed is a draft of a proposed b111 \"To authorize appropriations for the Saline Water Conversion Program, to expand the program, and for other purposes.\" We recommend that the enclosed bill be referred to the appropriate committee for consideration, and we recommend that it be enacted. The program for the development of saline water conversion processes is making signifi\u00ad cant progress in its efforts to develop eco\u00ad nomic methods for producing fresh water from saline and brackish waters. It has supplied incentives for the development of desalting technology and has encouraged the growth of an increasingly valuable and sig\u00ad nificant scientific program. The program authorized under the Act of July 3, 1952, was focused primarily upon 4650 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 basie-research. While basic research efforts must continue, the program is now at the stage where it must place growing emphasis on the testing and practical application of the earlier research effort. To achieve this purpose, it is necessary to expand the exist\u00ad ing saline water conversion program authori\u00ad zation in order to cover the proposed program for Fiscal Years 1968 through 1970. The en\u00ad closed bill has been drafted to accomplish these needs. The Act of July 3, 1952 (Public Law 82- 448), as amended, authorizes \"to be appropri\u00ad ated such sums, to remain available until expen~d. as may be necessary, but not more than $90,000,000, plus such additional sums as the\u00b7congress may hereafter authorize and appropriate, but not to exceed $185,000,000\" (emphasis supplied). Through Fiscal Year 1967, $82,500,000 has been appropriated. The Temaining amount, $7,500,000, plus $15,782;- 000, is required to meet the total program Fiscal Year 1968 appropriation request of $23,282,000. Based on current estimates the appropriations required for Fiscal Years 1969 and 1970 are $39.3 and $43.0 million re\u00ad spectively. Thus, the draft pill authorizes the current authori~ation to be increased from $90,000,000 to $188,082,000, and reduces the $185,000,000 figure included in the cur\u00ad rent bill to $86,918,000 to reflect the increased authorization requested for these years. With the authorization for Fiscal Year 1968, we will be able to meet the program goals of the following four major activities: 1.' Operating expenses for research and de\u00ad velopment, $18,532,000; Design,\u00b7 construction, modification, op\u00ad eration and maintenance of saline water conversion test beds a:tid test facilities, $4,298,000; 3. Design construction, acquisition, modi\u00ad fication, operation and maintenance of saline water 4. Administratkm and coordination, $1,- 762,000. . The above listed amounts require some explanation. First, the four activities total $26,782,000, which is the sum of \"total obli\u00ad gations for \"Salaries and Expenses\" and \"Operation and Maintenance\" shown in the Fiscal Year 1968 budget. Secondly, the total is $3,500,000 more than the appropriation re\u00ad quested for Fiscal Year 1968 in order to reflect the funds appropriated for Fiscal Year 1967 but not now planned to be obligated. The four program activities are defined as follows: 1. Operating expenses for research and de\u00ad ve,lopment. This includes all programs au\u00ad thorized under the Act of July 3, 1952, as amended, except those identified with other program activities. 2. Saline water conversion test beds and test facilities. Test beds are intermediate\u00ad size plants used as experimental tools. They are designed to facilitate the introduction of experimental hardware into the conversion process, for performance testing. Proposed for inclusion under this heading are the five demonstration plants authorized by the joint resolution of September 2, 1958 (PUblic Law 85-883) . It is proposed in the draft bill to transfer the modification, operation, and maintenance of these plants to the authority of the amended 1952 Act. The plants have adequately demonstrated the concepts for which they were originally designed and now better serve the function of test beds. Test facilities are sites including building, ut111- tles, and other services used for the purpose of conducting research and engineering and development projects which provide module, test bed, pilot plant, and component test operations. 3. Saline water conversion modules. These are sections of prototype plants which simu\u00ad late the operation of a complete plant and confirm essential design features. . 4. Administration and coordination. This includes planning, supervisory, technical and administrative activities within the Office of Saline Water related to its research and de\u00ad velopment contract and grant program, pro\u00ad gram analysis, feasibility studies, water eco\u00ad nomics investigations, and associated ad\u00ad ministrative support activities. For Fiscal Years 1969 and 1970 detailed discussions of program status and planned activities will be prescribed to the Senate and House Committees on Interior and In\u00ad sular Affairs well in advance of appropriation hearings. In administering the saline water conver\u00ad sion program, it is the Department's goal to maintain every degree of control necessary to insure that the obligated amounts set fo:r:th above will not be exceeded for any of the four major program activities. Nevertheless, because of the very nature of a research and deyelopment program it is recognized that program requirements may occasionally change during the fiscal year. For the most part, these program changes will be minor. However, in the event of unanticipated changes that necessitate a significant in\u00ad crease in any of the activities, the Depart\u00ad ment wm keep both Senate and House Com\u00ad mittees on Interior and Insular Affairs fully informed of the need for reprograming. Further, no reprograming action wm be taken to increase the amount specified for administration and coordination or to pro\u00ad vide funds for the construction, acquisition, or modification of a prototype plant. In addition to authorizing appropriations for the program for Fiscal Years 1968 through 1970, the bill makes a series of amendments to the Act of July 3, 1952, as amended. One of the amendmentS is to insert, following the word \"laboratory\" in subsection 2(b), the words \"test bed\". As indicated, \"test beds\" include the demonstration plants as well as any future intermediate-size plants needed to develop various desalting processes. The demonstration plants are no longer be\u00ad ing used as such. They can be of great value to the program when used as test beds, and it is proposed that they be made subject to the basic saline water Act. They will, how\u00ad ever, remain subject to section 3 (Financial Assistance from Public Agencies) , section 6 (Contracts for Materials and Supplies), and part of section 4 (which recognizes State equities). The portion of section 4 :which requires the plants to be disposed of at the end of twelve years (1970) will no longer ap\u00ad ply; the plants may be retained as long as they are needed for the program, which is presently authorized through Fiscal Year 1972. Subsection 2 (c) of the 1952 Act is amended to substitute the word \"prototype\" for the word \"demonstration\". This revision is in accord with the terminology currently in use within the program when referring a new section 9 is added to the 1952 Act which provides that the Act may be cited as the \"Saline Water Conversion Act\". The enclosed bill will permit a new step forward in the development of processes for the economical conversion of saline waters for beneficial consumptive use. We urge its immediate consideration and ap\u00ad proval. The Bureau of the Budget has advised that this proposed legislation is in accord with the program of the President. Sincerely yours, FRANK C. DILUZIO, Assistant Secretary of the Interior. PENSION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ACT OF 1967 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I intro\u00ad duce for appropriate reference a bill en\u00ad titled \"The Pension and Employee Bene\u00ad fit Act of 1967.\" This bill, in my judg\u00ad ment, is the first truly coptprehensive legislative proposal to deal with the_ma-jor problems and defects in our private pension plan system. As the ranking minority member of the committee having principal charge of such matters, I have introduced the bill as a matter of duty. The principal provisions of the bill are a creation and development of the think\u00ad ing of the minority counsel of the Com\u00ad mittee on Labor and Public Welfare, Frank Cummings, a member of the bars of New York and the District of Colum\u00ad bia, who is about to leave that service\u00ad as of today, as a matter of fact-to go with a New York law firm. In my judg ... ment, I think the whole Nation owes him a debt of gratitude for the work he has done on a very comprehensive plan to deal with problems of pension and wel\u00ad fare funds. This bill, which, as I have said, deals with the major problems and defects in our private pension plan system, would accomplish the following: First, the bill would establish mini\u00ad mum vesting standards for pension plans, thereby giving assurance that no pension plan could set its eligibility standards so high as to deny pension eligibility to all but a few employees. Second, the bill would establish mini\u00ad mum funding standards, thereby giving assurance that pension funds will be operated on a sound and solvent basis, enabling the fund to deliver the benefits which have been promised. Third, the 'bill would establish a pro\u00ad gram of pension plan reinsurance so that plans meeting the vesting and funding standards of the bill would be insured against termination, and retirees would be insured against loss of benefits when an employer goes out of business before the plan has been fully funded. Fourth, the bill would provide for the establishment of a special central port\u00ad ability fund, participation in which would be on a voluntary basis, enabling pension plans to have a central clearing\u00ad house of pension credits for persons transferring from one employer to an\u00ad other. Fifth, the b111 would establish certain minimum standards of conduct, restric\u00ad tions on conflicts of interest, and other ethical criteria which are to be followed in the administration of pension plans and other plans providing benefits for employees. Sixth, the bill would establish a U.S. Pension and Employee Benefit Plan Com\u00ad mission to administer the requirements of this bill. The Commission would be given sufficient enforcement powers to insure compliance, but the bill also pro\u00ad vides for judicial review, insuring to the maximum feasible extent against arbi\u00ad trary exercise of the Commission's powers. And seventh, the bill consolidates in the Commission most existing Federal regulatory standards relating to pension and welfare plans, thereby relieving em\u00ad ployers, unions, insurance companies and banks of the necessity of dealing with multiple Federal agencies--such as the Labor Department under the Dis\u00ad closure Act or the Treasury Department under the pension provisions of the tax code. Under this bill, a qualification February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- \u00b7 SENATE 4651 certificate from the Pension Commission will be sufficient to satisfy most, if not all, Federal regulatory statutes govern\u00ad ing employee benefit plans. I. BACKGROUND Mr. President, there are now almost $100 billion in private pension plans, yet there is almost no Federal regulation of the conduct of these plans' affairs, no minimum standards governing their es\u00ad tablishment or operation, and, far too often, no practical means by which a beneficiary can secure his rights. Mr. President, I am committed to pre\u00ad serving, fostering, and improving the private pension plan system. I join those who also want to improve social security, but I have no illusions that so\u00ad cial security will ever, or ought ever, to replace private pension plans. For pri\u00ad vate plans serve a dual purpose of sup\u00ad plementing the very limited benefits pay\u00ad able under social security while at the same time providing very substantial funds for investment, thereby fostering the growth of this Nation's economy. Two years ago, the President's Com\u00ad mittee on Corporate Pension Funds is\u00ad sued a report, which has become the \"bible\" in this field, in which\u00b7 it was rec\u00ad ommended that every pension plan be required to \"provide some reasonable measure of vesting for the protection of employees\"; that minimum funding standards be established because \"inade\u00ad quate funding of private pension plans under present standards places an un\u00ad warranted financial risk on employees during their retirement years\"; that \"the possibility of developing an institution arrangement for transferring and accu\u00ad mulating private pension credits deserves serious study\"; and that, although fund\u00ad ing provides some measure of protection for retirees, it \"may not protect plan participants from losing at least some of their equity in the event of a plan's termination,'' and, to meet the latter problem, the idea of reinsurance \"is worthy of serious study.'' That was 2 years ago, but as far as I know, no comprehensive plan for imple\u00ad mentation of the recommendations of the President's Committee has been forthcoming until this bill which I intro\u00b7\u00ad duce today. I hasten to add that it was not forth\u00ad coming last week when the President called for enactment of additional pro\u00ad tection for welfare and pension 'Plan beneficiaries. For the bill he endorsed last week, which has been introduced in the Senate as S. 1024, is strictly a con\u00ad flict-of-interest and ethical-standards bill. It includes basic standards of good faith for plan trustees, but it sets no standards for the plans themselves. The President's bill, moreover, ignores almost all the recommendations of the President's own Committee on Corporate Pension Funds--particularly those con\u00ad cerning vesting and funding. It ignores the need for reinsurance. It does nothing for portability. It continues to rely, moreover, in large part,. on the now well-nigh dis\u00ad credited technique of requiring more dis\u00ad closure--on the theory, I suppose, that if you can only get the plan administra\u00ad tor to disclose enough, the beneficiaries will figure out what is w.rong. I doubt that they will. It is hard enough for lawyers and actuaries to read annual reports, balance sheets, and other finan\u00ad cial statements. I doubt that we can expect the average pensioner to absorb, let alone to have the expertise to see all the implications of, a complex pension plan. The President's bill, while it has some worthwhile features--almost all of which are included in essence in titles IV and V of my bill-would require audits of pen\u00ad sion books by accountants, which is fine as far as it goes, but the key men in this field are the actuaries who can tell you, not just how much cash you have, but how much you will n~ed 10 years from now to meet the benefits which will ac\u00ad crue in the meantime. My bill requires actuarial certifications at periodic in\u00ad tervals, not just accountants' audits. The President's bill gives all power to the Secretary of Labor. With all due respect to my good friend, the Secretary of Labor, pension plans, in my judgment, are highly technical financial arrange\u00ad ments, every bit as complex as stocks and bonds, and what we need here is an independent commission~like the SEC-to administer this highly complex field. My bill would establish a U.S. Pension Commission-patterned on the SEC-to do just that. So I suggest that the President's bill has barely scratched the surface. The Congress, however, has begun to look further. The Fiscal Policy Subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee, of which I am also a member, held several hearings growing out of many complaints received from all parts of the country protesting that people who had worked long years for a pension were denied benefits on various grounds which seemed unfair or that the funds set aside to provide the benefits they had been promised proved far from sufficient. Other hearings looked into the feasibility of a pension reinsurance program, and the possibility of amending ,the Taft-Hartley provision dealing with labor-management trust funds. And, of course, the Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommit\u00ad tee, of which I am a\u00b7 member, held sev\u00ad eral very revealing investigations of the affairs of certain plans, and unearthed shocking misapplication of plan assets-\u00ad some $4 million in one case-all without violation of any State or Federal law. In short, we have been nibbling at this problem, circling around the edges, but we have never met the issues head on. U. THE BASIS FOR THIS BILL This subject is so complex, so tech\u00ad nical, that, in the absence of a specific proposal, the details of which are spelled out in a bill, the pension dialog tends to become abstract and diffuse. We are all against sin and in favor of virtue, but the specifics are much harder to pin down. I introduce this bill, therefore , as a basis for discussion-a way of bring\u00ad ing the pension dialog down to earth. I do not, however, claim that this bill is necessarily the right way to deal with every problem in the pension field. But it is my earnest hope that this bill, and subsequent discussion of it, hearings on it, and amendments to it, will help us find out what properly can and ought to be done in this field to improve our private pension system. The bill is drafted on the hypothesis that if it is desirable to deal with all the pension problems which have come to the surface in recent years, there is a way, a comprehensive way, to do it. This bill, in my judgment, presents the first concrete comprehensive scheme for establishing basic minimum pension standards and dealing with the problems which have come to light in recent years. 'Whether, in solving those problems, the bill creates a host of new ones, is something we have to find out, and I call upon those with specialized knowl\u00ad edge or significant experience in the field to give us their expert assistance so that this measure can be pragmatically eval\u00ad uated and improved or modified. UI. THE NEED. FOR A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH I believe that all of these problems are so interrelated that they cannot be solved without a comprehensive legisla\u00ad tive program dealing not only with mal\u00ad feasance of administrators, and not only with the consequences of plant shut\u00ad downs and plan terminations, but also with the broad spectrum of questions such as adequacy of funding, reasonable minimum standards of vesting, transfer\u00ad ability of credits under some circum\u00ad stances, and, in short, the establishment of certain general minimum standards to which all private pension plans must conform. That is by no means to say that we should crearoe a legislative straitjacket which would destroy the flexibility and inventiveness which have been one of the foundations of the enormous growth of pension plans in recent years. But I do think there ought to be some minimum standards in \u00b7this field. And, in my judg\u00ad ment, those minimum standards will no more force all pension plans to be the same thian the minimum wage law forces all employees' wages to be the same. The minimum is merely the basic level which decency and order require. A. FUNDING AND VESTING When we speak of adequate \"fund\u00ad ing,\" we mean setting aside sufficient funds to pay the benefi,ts provided in the plan. When we speak of \"vesting,\" on the other hand, we ordinarily mean the establishment of a participant's interest in a fund which he will retain even if he loses his job. It is easy enough to \"fund'' a plan with no vesting-as there are no vested liabil\u00ad ities, there is no need for funds to pay those liabilities. Thus, for example, if a fund promises to pay \"such benefits as the tl\"WSStees may decide from time to time to pay,\" the plan can never be \"un\u00ad funded\" because the trustees can always decide to cut benefits. Conversely, a \"vested interest\" in an ~unded plan may be worth very little, because no matter how \"vested\" a pen\u00ad sion right may be, it is worthless if the trust fund is depleted. Either way-a vested interest in an unfunded plan, or a funded plan with no 4652 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 vested interests-an employee may learn after years of faithful service that his expected pension was a cruel hoax. There is no easy solution, however. Industry needs vary widely; vesting after 20 years may work well in an industry with a stable work force, while in certain high-labor-turnover trades such 20-year vesting may set the standards so high as to make pension almost unattainable for most employees. I refuse to believe, however, that the problem is insoluble. This bill sets the standards at a point which is, in my judgment, a bare mini\u00ad mum: as to vesting, the bill requires that an employee after 15 years of serv\u00ad ice and reaching the age of 45 must re\u00ad ceive a nonforfeitable right to a full pen\u00ad sion, or, in the alternative, a 50-percent right after 10 years and full entitlement after 20. That is not a high standard; it is minimal. A man who has devoted 15 years of his life to working under a plan in the expectation of pension has earned something, he has paid for it, and he ought not to be told in his later years, after devoting much of his working life to service with one company, that his rights have been forfeited because of the \"small print\" in the pension contract. As to funding, again this bill is mini\u00ad mal, for it gives existing plans 40 years to amortize their unfunded liabilities, and 30 years for new plans. That is a long time, but it is considered a reason\u00ad able amortization period by most pen\u00ad sion planners. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that this bill, without further qualifica\u00ad tions, could have a damaging effect on pension plans in certain low-wage in\u00ad dustries. In some of those industries, it is argued, payment of even minimal pensions depends upon marginal funding and eligibility standards so high that most employees do in fact forfeit their rights before retirement. That is an un\u00ad happy situation, but if it is true that the choice in those industries is between such a plan or no pension plan at all, then we need to find out the facts-the pre\u00ad cise details-and I call upon the pension planners and administrators, the Gov\u00ad ernment agencies and others with spe\u00ad cific knowledge and experience in the field to come forward with what infor\u00ad mation they have so that we can be sure that whatever law we enact will help and not hinder the development, solvency, and fairness of private pension plans. Conversely, it may also turn out, in some multiemployer plans, that, because of the added opportunity for continued employment under these plans even after involuntary separation from a particular job, vesting standards may not need to be as high as elsewhere and can still as\u00ad sure eligibility of a reasonable propor\u00ad tion of the participants. Once again, we need the facts, the precise details of as many varied types of pension plans as we can find, to be sure that this legisla\u00ad tion is refined and tailored to fit the needs of the private pension industry. But the only way, in my judgment, to find those facts is to focus on a particu\u00ad lar bill, a precise legislative proposal, and see exactly how it will work. B. PORTABILITY -be insuring that the money will be there, The problem of portability is intimate- without insuring that anyone will have ly related to funding and vesting. As a right to receive it when he retires. long as plans have no minimum stand- This bill reinsures against only one ards, it will be difficult, indeed, to devise contingency: termination of the employ\u00ad any effective portability scheme-for how er's business before the unfunded liabili\u00ad can an employee with a vested interest ties of the pension plan are funded.

If we are to insure employees that their pen\u00ad sions will be paid even if the employer's business terminates, then we must regu\u00ad late the pension fund itself, at least to a limited extent. S~rely we would not ask the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor\u00ad poration to reinsure bank deposits with\u00ad out some control of the bank's affairs. Yet, if we regulate the fund itself, it seems inevitable that we require some mini\u00ad mum standard of vesting, or else we may developed over the years in our courts of equity. E. REMEDIES Title V of the bill gives the Commis\u00ad sion the right to sue in Federal court to require compliance with the vesting\u00ad .funding-reirumrance provi.sions of the bill, and it gives the Federal district courts equivalent jurisdiction to enter\u00ad tain a suit by a plan administrator to test any action of the Commission. This title also gives the Commission authority to sue to enforce the ethical standards es\u00ad tablished by title IV of the bill. And it February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4653 also permits private parties to sue for rights guaranteed by the bill, as well as for breach of any contract or trust guar\u00ad anteeing them any rights. The alternative remedies are impor\u00ad tant; too often .a beneficiary who has wrongfully been denied his rights will not bring suit because his costs in main\u00ad taining a legal action will exceed the small amount of his pension. It is in cases like these in which a pensioner-or a group of pensioners-with a meritori\u00ad ous case c,an request the Commission to bring suit in their behalf. The district courts, in turn, are au\u00ad thorized to issue injunctions or other orders to compel compliance with the law, and, if necessary, to put a fund into receivership until it..<; affairs are put in order. The bill does not attempt to spell out all the fiduciary standards to which every trustee must adhere. It does spe\u00ad cifically prohibit certain confticts of in\u00ad terest, but, beyond that, the bill leaves the matter of trustee standards to the courts--as has been done with great suc\u00ad cess for hundreds of years under our Anglo-American legal tradition. \u00b7 The law the courts will apply under this bill in such cases will vary-if the trust agreement specifies the law of a particu\u00ad lar State, that State's law will apply\u00ad otherwise it will be Federal common law, as developed by the Federal courts. In my judgment, that is the best way to de\u00ad velop fiduciary standards-and it is the way most consistent with our legal tradi\u00ad tions. F. SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF PROFIT-SHARING RETmEMENT PLANS Profit-sharing plans, which I have long sought to encourage as a valuable in\u00ad ducement to labor-management coop\u00ad ~ration in the interest of stability and higher productivity, present many sig\u00ad nificant differences from pension plans, even when profit sharing involves pay\u00ad ment of benefits on retirement. This was clearly brought out last year in hear\u00ad ings on private pension plans held by the Joint Economic Committee. These dif\u00ad ferences in operation necessitate differ\u00ad ences in treatment, although in both cases the goal should be to insure fulfill\u00ad ment of the legitimate expectations of the participants. The bill I am introducing today seeks to reflect these important differences. It defines profit-sharing retirement plans separately from ordinary pension plans, and reflects the fact, for example, that true profit-sharing retirement plans are automatically fully funded because bene\u00ad fits are entirely dependent upon the em\u00ad ployer's profits. IV. THE PENSION COMMISSION-A SINGLE AU\u00ad THORITY TO REPLACE MULTIPLE AGENCIES The concept of a single authority to regulate the creation and operation of pension plans is one which should be beneficial to the labor organizations, em\u00ad ployers, and participants as well as those who sell and service pension plans, such as the banks, insurance companies, and pension consultants. Presently various aspects of some pension plans are un\u00ad regulated while other aspects are regu\u00ad lated by State agencies, by the Treasury Department, Labor Department, Securi\u00ad ties and Exchange Commission, among others. The need for coordination of these efforts together with any new regu\u00ad lation is obvious. Accordingly, this bill would make the qualification procedures now administered by the Treasury a part of the operations of the proposed Pen\u00ad sion Commission. It may be that the entire scope of Treasury operations af\u00ad fecting pension plans should be trans\u00ad ferred to the Commission. And yet, such determinations as the manner of inte\u00ad grating pension benefits with social se\u00ad curity benefits and the determination of reasonable levels of compensation obvi\u00ad ously have an important impact on Fed\u00ad eral revenue considerations. Similarly, the extent to which regulations of pen\u00ad sion plan investments is now performed by the Securities and Exchange Com\u00ad mission warrants careful consideration as to what functions, if any, should be transferred to the proposed Commission. The point to be made here is that a great deal of thought will be required to develop a rational and coordinated sys\u00ad tem for the regulation of pension and other employee benefit systems without adversely affecting the traditional role of existing agencies now concerned with some aspect of these plans. But the goal is an important one, and worthy of the effort that will be required. For, after much thought on this subject, I am con\u00ad vinced that a single agency is required. It will be a very difficult task to regulate the operation of employee benefit plans sufficiently to assure the legitimate ex\u00ad pectations of employee participants while at the same time avoiding undue or un\u00ad necessary interference with the opera\u00ad tion of these plans. Overregulation or unnecessary regulation would be worse than none, for it would deter the instal\u00ad lation and improvement of these much needed programs. It is a tortuous course to be steered between the problems of frustrated expectations for pension plan members growing out of no regulation and the equally damaging frustrations growing out of an irrational regulatory scheme which deters the employer from instituting a pension plan for the em\u00ad ployees. It seems clear to me that this course could best be steered by an agency which has the general responsibility for encouraging the growth of the private pension system including the implemen\u00ad tation of needed rules to protect pension participants. Mr. President, as I have said, the com\u00ad plexities in this field are awesome. The bill I introduce today is not perfect, but it represents several years work by my\u00ad self and my staff, in consultation with representatives of the business com\u00ad munity, organized labor, and the bank-. ing and insurance industries. I hasten to add that none of those groups endorse all o'f the bill, though each, I suspect, has much to gain from certain features of it. But the bill now needs the wider scrutiny that comes with introduction, publica\u00ad tion, hearings, and the rest of the legis\u00ad lative process. I ask, therefore, Mr. President, that the text of this bill be printed in the RECORD at this point, together with an accompanying analytical explanation. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Where an insured pension plan is funded by level annual premiums extending not beyond the retirement age for each individual member and benefits are guaranteed by the insurance company to the extent that pre\u00ad miums have been paid, the report required by this subsection may certify the adequacy of the premiums to provide for the pay\u00ad ment of all benefits under the plan in lieu of the matters required to be certified under clauses (1), (2), and (3). (d) The administrator in respec\u00b7t of a registered pension plan shall cause the plan to be reviewed by a person authorized by subsection (e) not more than three years af\u00ad ter registration and at intervals of not more than three years thereafter and the person reviewing the plan shall prepare a report certifying- (1) the estimated cost of benefits in re\u00ad spect of service in the next succeeding year and the rule for computing such cost in subsequent years up to the date of the next report; ( 2) the surplus or the experience deficiency in the pension plan after making allowance for the present value of all special payments required to be made in the future by the employer as determined by previous reports; and (3) the special payments which will liquidate any such experience deficiency over a term not exceeding five years. If any such report discloses a surplus in a pension plan, the amount of any future pay\u00ad ments required to be made to the fund or plan may be reduced by the amount of such surplus. A report under this subsection shall be filed with the Commission by the ad\u00ad ministrator upon its receipt. (e) The reports and certificates referred to in subsections (c) and (d) shall be made by an actuary certified by the Commission under section 4 (c) : Provided, That the Commission may exempt any plan, in whole or in part, from the requirement that such reports and certificates be filed where the Commission finds such filing to be unnecessary.

(II) the Commission may by regulation approve alternative requirements for pay\u00ad ments into the fund other than those speci\u00ad fied in subparagraph I of this subsection (f), when, in the opinion of the Commission, such standards will provide reasonable assurance of sufficient assets in the fund of the multi\u00ad employer plan to provide for payment of anticipated benefits. (g) Each pension plan shall, as a condi\u00ad tion of registration under this title, apply for reinsurance and pay the reinsurance premiums provided in title II. (h) For the purpose of this section, a profit-sharing-retirement plan, within the meaning of section 2(26) of this Act, which meets the requirements of title I insofar as they are made specifically applicable to such a plan by section 105 shall be deemed fully funded.

SEC. 507. In any case in which a trust agreement relating to a fund subject to this Act contains a provision stating that it shall be construed under the law of a particular State, such provision shall be controlling in any suit arising under this Act for breach of any agreement or trust relating to an em\u00ad ployees' benefit fund. SEc. 508. Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to nullify any provision of any State or Federal law not in direct confiict with a provision of this Act. If any provision of this Act or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Act and the applica\u00ad tion of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected. The statement, ordered to be printed in the RECORD, is as follows: EXPLANATORY NOTES CONCERNING PRINCIPAL PROVISIONS OF THE PENSION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ACT DEFINITIONS The definitions, as well as title I of the bill, follow the general format, after extensive revision, of the Pension Benefits Act, 1965, of the Province of Ontario, Canada. While the language of that Act obviously required substantial re-working to fit within the spe\u00ad cial framework of United States law and the different pattern of United States pension plans, nevertheless the general outlines of the Ontario Act may be useful, as a statute in pari materia, in interpreting this bill. The full text of the Ontario Act, as well as its interpretative regulations and an explana\u00ad tory statement by the Prime Minister of Ontario, are set forth in Private Pension Plans, Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Fiscal Policy of the Joint Economic Com\u00ad mittee 89th (section 2(2)) refers to a new agency, the United States Pension and Employee Benefit Plan Com\u00ad mission, which would be established under section 3 and would be given enforcement jurisdiction over all provisions of this Act, as well as over other existing laws dealing with employee benefit plans which are now administered by other agencies. The terms \".employee benefit plan\" and \"employee benefit fund\" are used only in title IV and the enforcement provisions of title V. Title IV does not regulate employee benefit plans which do not provide for bene\u00ad fits through the medium of an employee benefit fund. Only one section of the Act in any way affects an employee benefit plan without a fund, and that is section 504, which permits suits by private parties for breach of an agreement relating to an em\u00ad ployee benefit plan. The \"commerce\" language (section 2(9)) is intended to reach the outer limits of the Constitutional power to regul~te interstate commerce, subject to the specific exemptions and exclusions set forth in 'the bill. The term \"pension plan\" (section 2(13)) does not include a plan meeting defini\u00ad tion of a \"profit-sharing-retirement plan\" (section 2(25)). Profit-sharing-retirement plans are dealt with separately in the bill. To the extent that a deferred profit sharing pian does not meet the terms of\u00b7 the defini\u00ad tion set forth in section 2(25), however, it could nevertheless be considered a pension plan subject to the requirements of the bill applicable to such plans. A regular profit\u00ad sharing plan, however, as distinguished from a profit-sharing-retirement plan, ordinarily would not fall within either definition and would not be covered by title I, because no retirement benefits would be provided. The term \"reinsured pension plan\" (section 2 ( 14) ) , which is used in ti j;le II, is, strictly speaking, a misnomer, as the program pro\u00ad vided under title II is really an insurance, rather than a \"reinsurance\", program, except in cases involving plans funded originally through the medium of an insurance con\u00ad traet. Note also that, while plans are re\u00ad quired to pay premiums from the first day of coverage under the Act, they do not become effectively \"reinsured\" until 5 years have ex\u00ad pired. Note further that an amendrilent to a plan resulting in a substantial increase in unfunded liability may be deemed a new \"plan\" for reinsurance purposes. 1 ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION The Commission established by section 3 would be an independent agel?-CY organized on the SEC pattern. The language of section 3(a) is similar to the language establishing the SEC. The general intent of the bill is to centralize all federal regulation relating to employee benefit plans in a single agency, thereby to the maximum feasible extent re\u00ad lieving plan administrators of the burden of multiple-agency regulation and avoiding the necessity of multiple applic_ations, multiple inspections, and overlapping jurisdiction&. It is understood, howev:er, that not all as\u00ad pects of this field can be so consolidated. T.he SEC will continue to have responsibility to enforce the securities laws, and the Fed\u00ad eral Reserve and other agencies will continue to regulate banks. Section 4(b) (1) recog\u00ad nizes this fact and attempts to avoid dupli\u00ad cation by allowing the Commission to dele\u00ad gate its functions in certain cases to other agencies which would be inspecting banks !n any event. Section 4(c). would authorize the Com\u00ad mission to license persons performing actuarial services and certifications under the bill. Despite the rather extended series of definitions in section 2 and rather technical statement of funding and vesting require\u00ad ments in title I, a great deal will inevitably depend on the accuracy 9f actuarial deter\u00ad minations. It would be impossible to regu\u00ad late actuarial assumptions such as life ex\u00ad pectancy and rate of labor turnover by setting forth requirements in statutory form. The only viable approach, therefore, is to regulate to some extent the persons compe\u00ad tent to make certifications based on such assumptions. The long-term accuracy of actuarial assumptions \u00b7 and certifications, however, is subject to a check underysection 108(b) (3), which requires that an actuarial error resulting in an experience deficiency would need to , be corrected and funded over a. much shorter period of time than any other unfunded liability. Section 6(a) transfers to the Commission the administration of the Welfare and Pen\u00ad sion Plans Disclosure Act. Ideally, that Act should be consolidated with and made a part of the provisions of this blll, and no doubt such would be the case in the long run. As an interim matter, however, Section 103 does permit the Commission to consolidate the reporting requirements of the two Acts into a single report form. Section 6(c) should be read together with the enforcement provisions of title V. While title V permits institution of legal proceed\u00ad ings in any of the United States District Courts. there are often problems of obtaining service of process upon all the necessary parties. The Administration bill (S. 1024) would permit an action in any United States District Court and then allow the court's process to reach beyond the confines of its district-indeed, nationwide. The result would be that anyone could be made to respond anywhere, subject to a later motion to transfer the case to a more convenient forum. Section 6 (c) of my bill would per\u00ad mit an action to be brought against a plan or person in only one district outside his home district, and that would be the Dis\u00ad trict of Columbia, as service of process could always be made upon the necessary parties merely by serving the Commission as statu\u00ad tory agent. FUNDING AND VESTING As indicated above, this title uses the Ontario Pension Benefits Act as a general model (see comments on definitions, above). It should be noted that the enforcement provisions relating to title I do not, how\u00ad ever, appear in this title but rather are placed in title V, along with all other en\u00ad forcement provisions under the Act. En\u00ad forcement \u00b7of title I is not based on the typical device of an administrative hearing followed by review in the Court of Appeals, where the Commission's findings would be final and binding. Rather, the Commission would be required in any case in which, for example, registration is denied, to bring an action in a District Court to compel com\u00ad pliance with the registration requirements of the Act, and the Commission would have to prove its case de novo. In addition, any person aggrieved by an action of the Com\u00ad mission, as, for \u00b7example, in a case in which registration is denied, would not be required to wait for the Commission to seek enforce\u00ad ment but could bring an action in a District Court. immediately to review the Commis\u00ad sion's action. Thus, maximal judicial re\u00ad view is provided. J The notice requirements of section 106(a) require not only that_ each participant \u00b7re\u00ad ceive an explanation of his rights under a plan, but also that an employee leaving J;lis job with a vested interest in a pension must receive a certificate telling him what kind of a right he has, so that, years later when he reaches retirement age, he will know precisely -what he can expect. The vesting provisions of section 107 re\u00ad quire either full vesting of a non-forfeitable pension right after.15 years of service, or 50% vesting after 10 years and full vesting after 20 years, in each case subject to attaining the age of 45. It should be noted that this provision does apply retroactively to service ,performed prior to tne effective date of the Act, as the initial sentence of section 107(a) makes its requirements applicable only \"in respect of service on or after January 1, 1968.\" Indeed, even if a plan increases its benefits, the required vesting would only apply to service after the effective date of the increase, though the plan would be permitted, of course, to vest the iucrease retroactively. It should also be noted that the \"full pension benefits\" which must be vested in the stipu;\u00ad lated time are those based upon service up to the vesting date; additional benefits could then be added in respect of further service after the vesting date. The funding provisions of section 108 are basically 40 year funding for old p~ans, and 30 year funding for new plans or new amendments. Thus, a plan starting out anew with an initial unfunded 11ab111ty based upon past credited service occurring prior to the effective date of the plan would be re-4660 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- \u00b7 SENATE February 28, 1967 quired to pay into the plan sufficient money to cover current service costs plus sufficient additional moneys to amortize the initial unfunded liab111ty over 30 years. But in any case in which the estimate of the sums necessary to achieve such 30-year funding is in error and an \"experience deficiency\" de\u00ad velops, the deficiency must be made up in 5 years, subject to the hardship proviso set forth in section 108(b) (3). In the case of multiemployer plans meet\u00ad ing the requirements of section 108(f), al\u00ad ternative funding requirements are pro\u00ad vided, in recognition of the fact that such plans tend to be more stable and less sus\u00ad ceptible to termination. Section 108(f) is designed to meet some of the problems of such industries as the apparel\u00b7 and clothing industries, where, because the plans' con\u00ad tinuance does not depend on the continuance of any particular employer, full funding need not be achieved as rapidly. Even so, it has been suggested that an additional alterna\u00ad tive funding arrangement in such industries may be warranted, requiring that in such plans, for example: (A) The projected income throughout the ensuing 10-year period, based on expected contributions at contribution rates stipu\u00ad lated in existing collective bargaining agree\u00ad ments, plus expected interest, shall be at least as great as the projected expenses ot the plan, provided that such plan (i) has been in existence and has paid benefits for at least 10 years prior to the registration of the plan, and (11) has retired at least 5 per centum of the employees covered by the plan at the time of registration and thereafter; and (B) The calculation of the projections under paragraph (A) above shall be based on the following numbers of employees: (1) employees who may be anticipated tore\u00ad ceive retirement payments during the suc\u00ad ceeding 10 years, including those already on the retirement rolls; and (2) employees who within one year prior to acquiring vested rights hereunder notify the plan administra\u00ad tor in writing of their expectation to acquire such rights. under the plan during the fol\u00ad lowing year. The viab111ty and soundness of such addi\u00ad tional alternatives, along with such others as may be proposed, are certainly worthy of serious consideration. Sections 111 and 112 would have the effect of consolidating within the Commission jur\u00ad isdiction over the principal existing regula\u00ad tory laws concerning pension plans--tax and minimum wage qualification. It is under\u00ad stood that jurisdiction over section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code has been jealously guarded by the Treasury. Nevertheless, sec\u00ad tion 111 recognizes that the Treasury may have confiicting policy considerations: on the one hand, it seeks to implement the policy of encouraging pension plans, which is in\u00ad herent in section 401 of the Code, yet on the other hand the Treasury is legitimately con\u00ad cerned with maximization of revenue. The transfer of section 401's enforcement to the Commission would ensure that that section will be interpreted in a manner most sympa\u00ad thetic to the growth and soundness of pri\u00ad vate pension plans. REINSURANCE This feature of the bill is based in part on a measure sponsored by Senator Hartke in the 89th Congress. The two major differences between this title and that bill is that this bill does not insure against loss of plan as\u00ad sets through bad investments, and it does undertake to insure pension plans without regulating them. Instead, this title insures against one contingency only-termination of the employing enterprise before full fund\u00ad ing-and insurance applies only to plans meeting the vesting and funding standards of title I, and then only after 5 years, compli\u00ad ance. The bill sponsored by Senator Hartke last year made reinsurance a condition of tax qualification, while this bill makes rein\u00ad surance a mandatory requirement, u,nder sec\u00ad tion 203(a), as a tration under section 108(g). PORTABILITY The portabillty program under title III is completely voluntary, and section 301 (a) sets forth a specific declaration of policy pro\u00ad hibiting the Commission from making par\u00ad ticipation in the portab111ty program a condi\u00ad tion of registration under title I. The exist\u00ad ence of a portab111ty clearing house, however, may be a useful serv-ice to those organiza\u00ad tions which have already begun to seek ways of developing reciprocal credit systems. Cer\u00ad tain labor organizations, particularly in the building trades, have pension plans in vari\u00ad ous regions of the country with similar bene\u00ad fit and funding features, and have sought to establish reciprocity systems between such regional plans. The existence of a central pension credit clearing house may be a use\u00ad ful accommodation and catalyst for such reciprocity arrangements. ADMINISTRATION OF EMPLOYEES' BENEFIT FUNDS Title IV deals with many of the same prob\u00ad lems as are dealt with in the Administration bill introduced by Senator Yarborough, S. 1024, and Mr. Perkins, H.R. 5741. There are a number of significant differences, how\u00ad ever. Section 401 requires that if there is a fund, it must be established pursuant to a duly executed trust agreement, thus, in effect, producing substantially the same effect as is accomplished by the Administration's bill, which clothes the administrators of such funds with the responsibilities of \"fiduci\u00ad aries.\" The basic difference here is that estab\u00ad lishes the fam111ar standard of \"a man of ordinary prudence\" and then turns the interpretation of that term over to the Federal courts exclusively. (Sections 14(a) and 9) . The result of those provisions of the Administration blll would seem to be to wipe out the vast body of State case law on the subject of trusts and fiduciary re\u00ad sponslb111ty, except to the extent that it is incorporated into the development of federal case law on the subject. Such a develop\u00ad ment of a federal case law of trusts, how\u00ad ever, will only occur after many years, as the cases arise one by one in the federal courts. In the meantime, there will be considerable uncertainty among trustees as to what the law really is. Such uncer~ainty for an extended period may well be too high a price to pay for the establishment of fed\u00ad eral fiduciary standards. Titles IV and V of this b111, on the other hand, take a more moderate approach. In\u00ad sofar as trust agreements contain \"choice of law\" provisions designating the trust law of a particular state as applicable, such provisions are required to be honored, pur\u00ad suant to section 507. If no such \"choice of law\" provisions is included in the trust agreement, then the federal courts would apply federal law. Under this system, cer\u00ad tainty would be preserved for those trustees who reqUire it-typically banks and trust companies--while the development of fed\u00ad eral trust law would proceed in those cases where no specific State law is spelled out. Along the same lines, the Administration bill again attaches no importance to the his\u00ad torical development of trust law, in that it provides, in section 14(k), that no \"exculpa\u00ad tory provision\" shall relieve any fiduciary from any of his responslb111ties. Of course, the law of trusts, as it has developed in the cases down through the centuries, has de\u00ad veloped various standards for enforcing or nullifying such \"exculpatory clauses,\" de\u00ad pending on the circumstances. For exam\u00ad ple, in many pension trusts, responsib111ty is divided between the trustee (often a bank or trust company) and a labor-manage\u00ad ment \"Committee,\" which typically is given power to \"instruct\" the trustee as to certain matters. Typically, a trust company or bank simply wm not accept appointment as a trustee under these circumstances unless t.he trust agreement provides that the Bank shall not be held responsible for any action taken in reliance on instructions from the \"Committee\" as provided in the agreement. Is this an illegal \"exculpatory clause\" under the Administration bill? It seems likely. Nor can all such problems be spelled out in the statute. The answer, once again, is to leave such matters to development through the case law, and to preserve what certainly we already have by allowing existing case law to continue in existence where it is specifical\u00ad ly made applicable under the terms of the trust agreement. The \"conflict of interest\" provisions of this b111 and the Administration b111 are quite similar. As indicated above, title IV applies only to funds, not to plans without funds-i.e., those whose benefits are payable solely out of the general assets of the em\u00ad ployer. A principal difference between the provisions of this bill and the administration bill concerns the prohibition against being on two payrolls at once. The administration bill, like this bill, prohibits fiduciaries from receiving any assets out of the fund, except as regular benefits. The administration b111 attempts to accomplish this first, by stating that the moneys in the fund shall be used \"for the sole and exclusive purpose\" of providing benefits and defraying \"reason\u00ad able costs of administering the plan.\" (Sec\u00ad tion 14(c)). The Administration bill also prohibits the making of loans from the fund to any fiduciary (Section 14(f)), and pro\u00ad hibits a fiduciary from dealing with the fund in his own account (section 14(e) (3)). These provisions will probably cover most conflict of interest situation, unless a dis\u00ad honest person is quite clever. The trouble is that recent hearings have shown the de\u00ad velopment of the most ingenious schemes for siphoning off pension funds, and a b111 such as this ought to be drafted with such ingenious schemes in mind. The administration concentrates on the possible misdeeds of the fiduciary-the trus\u00ad tee himself, while my bill concentrates on the representatives of the employer or the union. My bill controls the actions of the truly independent trustee only by application of the law of trusts, without attempting to spell out every detail of that law as it exists in the cases, but my bill does specifically pro\u00ad hibit the representatives of the employer or the union from siphoning off fund assets to their own use, and this is done in much more comprehensive language than that used in the administration bill (section 404). One other major difference between the two bills relates to payroll padding. Last year's Investigations Subcommittee hearings dis\u00ad closed that one of the most effective ways of depleting a fund was to permit an officer of the employer or the union to draw a salary from both the fund and the employer or union, as the case may be. The theory of my bill is that if a union officer is serving as a trustee and still drawing his salary from the union, he may not also draw a salary from the fund itself-though he may receive expense money and a reasonable fee for at\u00ad tending fund meetings, and the same pro\u00ad hibition is applied to management officers. (Section 404). The Administration bill al\u00ad lows such officers to be on both payrolls at once, but instead limits fiduciaries to \"rea\u00ad sonable compensation\". Such a provision may well get the Labor Department into the business of passing on the reasonableness of every fee paid to every trustee in the Nation, which seems to me to be neither necessary nor wise. I would rather focus on those sal\u00ad aries which are paid in the true conflict of interest situation, and, when it comes to the hiring of the truly independent trustee in a truly arms-length business situation, rely on the ordinary law of trusts. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4661 ENFORCEMENT Title V contains enforcement provisions covering the whole bill. These provisions should be read in connection with the notes under section 6 (service of process) and Title I (judicial review of Oommission determina\u00ad tions with respect to funding and vesting). Basically, section 501 permits the Commis\u00ad sion to sue to enforce title I, and section 502 permits the Commission to sue to enforce title IV. Section 503 authorizes the Court to appoint a receiver, where necessary, in either case. Section 504 provides a private remedy in case of violation of title IV or in case of violation of any provision of a plan. The law applicable in any such case based upon a breach of contract or breach of trust, how\u00ad ever, would be State law in any case in which the agreement designates the law of a State as applicable, and in all other cases, federal common law would apply, although, of course, the federal courts would be expected to draw upon the State common law as a source for the development of a federal com\u00ad mon law in this area. Of particular im\u00ad portance are the provisions of sections 502 and 504 which permit suit to be brought by the Commission or a participant either against the fund. to compel payment of bene\u00ad fits, or \"in the name of the fund\" against any other person to compel return of misap\u00ad propriated assets--a remedy comparable to the fam111ar \"stockholders deriv~tive suit\" under the law of corporations. Mr. JAVITS. I also ask unanimous consent that this bill, which has its pri\u00ad mary emphasis in the labor field, be re\u00ad ferred first to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, and that if it should be reported from that committee and, as reported, it should contain any provisions affecting the tax laws, it will then be re\u00ad ferred to the Finance Committee for consideration of those provisions. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without \u00b7objection, it is so ordered. SAN FELIPE DIVISION, CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT, CALIFORNIA Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, I send to the desk for appropriate reference a bill to authorize the Secretary of the In\u00ad terior to construct, operate, and maintain the San Felipe division, central valley project, in California. My able colleague and longtime friend in the House of Representatives, CHARLES S. GUBSER, has previously introduced this legislation in the House. This project will eventually provide 273,000 acre-feet of water annually for 448,000 acres of land in the counties of Santa Clara, San Benito, Santa Cruz, and Monterey on the west slope of the coast range. Wells in that area are be\u00ad coming dry, or polluted from boron in\u00ad filtration, and in the coastal areas, sea water intrusion has become a major problem. Rapid urbanization of the area has also resulted in serious pres\u00ad sures on the existing water supply. The project water supply will be ob\u00ad tained from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta through the operation of existing facilities of the central valley project, and will then be transported through facilities of the State water project from the delta to the San Luis Reservoir. A low level tunnel will carry the water through Pacheco Pass in the Diablo Range to a 104-mile canal and pipeline distribution system. Other features of the project will in\u00ad clude one large and several smaller pumping plants, power transmission fa\u00ad cilities, three small regulatory reservoirs, and distribution facilities. The total Federal investment will be $89.8 million. Inlet works and the first 2-mile section of the Pacheco Tunnel are nearing completion under a 1964 con\u00ad tract awarded as an economy measure to permit construction before the site was covered with water by the filling of the San Luis Reservoir. In October 1966, the Department of the Interior approved and submitted to Congress a Bureau of Reclamation feasi\u00ad bility report recommending authoriza\u00ad tion of the $89.8 million project. There\u00ad port stated that the project was eco\u00ad nomically feasible and financially justi\u00ad fied, the cost-benefit analysis showing a very favorable 1: 3.27 ratio. Local agencies are cooperating with Federal authorities in planning this project. The tricounty water authority has shared the cost of investigation to date, and other local interests are orga\u00ad nizing an agency qualified to contract with the United States under reclama\u00ad tion law. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD at this point. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately re\u00ad ferred; and, without objection, the bill will be printed in the RECORD. The bill <S. 1111) to authorize the Sec\u00ad retary of the Interior to construct, op\u00ad erate, and maintain the San Felipe di\u00ad vision, central valley project, California, and for other purposes, introduced by Mr. KucHEL, was received, read twice by its title, referred to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, and ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 1111 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, for the purpose of providing irrigation and municipal and industrial water supplies, area redevelopment, conserving and developing fish and wildlife resources, enhancing out\u00ad door recreation opportunities and other re\u00ad lated purposes, the Secretary of the Interior, acting pursuant to the Federal reclamation laws (Act of June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388, and Acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto), is authorized to construct, operate, and maintain, as an addition to, and an in\u00ad tegral part of, the Central Valley project, California, the San Felipe division.

Mr. President, recently in the Nevada Legislature a proposal was introduced, now being studied by the Nevada Assembly Committee on Taxa\u00ad tion, which seeks to impose an additional tax on coin operated devices through a tax credit formula. I ask that the assembly measures be printed in the RECORD following my re\u00ad marks. The bill which I now introduce renews a proposal I made, along with my col\u00ad league [Mr. BIBLE], in 1965 which recog\u00ad nizes that since Federal legislation in this field is designed for purposes of reg\u00ad ulation rather than for the raising of revenue, a more realistic formula be in\u00ad stituted. Our proposal stipulates that 80 per\u00ad cent of the occupational taxes collected on these devices be credited for similar taxes imposed by a State where the op\u00ad eration of such devices are legal. It is an amendment which would be consist\u00ad ent, in our opinion, with the action taken by the Congress in 1965 in the case of the New Hampshire lottery. Nevada, like New Hampshire, is in need of these locally raised revenues to 4662 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 meet its growing costs of government, not the least of which is . support of schools.

Mr. President, I introduce, for appropriate reference, a bill to establish the Dinosaur Trail National Monument near Glen Rose, Tex. This bill would authorize a national monument to preserve the site of per\u00ad haps the most numerous and best pre\u00ad served dinosaur tracks in the world. The footprints of the vanished dino\u00ad saurs can be seen preserved in the nat\u00ad ural rock that forms the bed of the beautiful little Paluxy River. The tracks, in part forming a trail, are said to be 135 million years old. My colleagues, Representatives Boa POAGE, of Waco, and JIM WRIGHT, of Fort Worth, earlier this year sponsored House bills to create this national monument. I am honored to introduce this companion Senate bill today. It is noteworthy that united community spirit in Glen Rose and Somervell County favors the preservation of these tracks in a national monument. About 30 dinosaur tracks are said to be visible today, left by dinosaurs in mud which has hardened into limestone. More tracks are likely to be uncovered. This legislation is made necessary by 'the fact that people pry up the dinosaur tracks out of the rock and carry them away. Previously, some of the tracks were quarried, and are on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Texas Memorial Museum in Austin. All of these tracks might be subject to removal were a na\u00ad tional monument not created to preserve the tracks as they were originally created by the feet of the dinosaurs. I have personally walked this creek bed and have seen the tracks, originally in mud, now turned to stone, where these giant, extinct creatures of a vanished time cycle walked up the creekbed with vast strides longer than that of any living creature. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4663 bill will be received and appropriately referred. The bill (S. 1113) to authorize the establishment of the Dinosaur Trail Na\u00ad tional Monument in the State of Texas, introduced by Mr. YARBOROUGH, was re\u00ad ceived, read twice by its title, and re\u00ad ferred to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. EXTENSION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE FEDERAL-STATE PROGRAM OF CHILD WELFARE SERVICES Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I introduce, for.appropriate reference, a bill to amend title V of the Social Security Act so as to extend and improve the Federal-State program of child welfare services. This proposed legislation was intro\u00ad duced in the 89th Congress in the House of Representatives by the late Congress\u00ad man John E. Fogarty, of Rhode Island, and could be called the greatest unfin\u00ad ished program left by Mr. Fogarty's un\u00ad timely death. The legislation calls for Federal participation in the cost of State child welfare services based on the State's per capita income. The proposal has the support of practically all of tho\u00b7se individuals most concerned with child welfare. Specifically, the bill would au\u00ad thorize: 1. SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT MATCHING FOR SALARIES AND TRAINING The Federal Governnient would pay 75 percent of the total of each State's sal\u00ad ary and training costs for child welfare personnel employed or preparing for em\u00ad ployment. 2. FIFTY TO EIGHTY -THREE PERCENT FOR ALL OTHER CHILD WELFARE COSTS Each State would receive funds to pay for a percentage of the cost of all child welfare services for every child who is the responsibility of the State or local public welfare agencies. Such funds would include coverage for purchase of care from voluntary agencies and for ad\u00ad ministrative costs other than salaries. Payments would be made on a match\u00ad ing basis, depending on a State's per capita income. The Federal share of each State's expenditures---for other than salaries and training-would be at least 50 percent and no more than 83 percent, with those States having the lowest per capita income receiving the largest Federal share. 3. STATES MUST SPEND NO LESS THAN BEFORE To make sure that the additional Fed\u00ad eral money made available by the bill would be spent to strengthen and expand child welfare programs, rather than used to replace State dollars, the legislation requires that State and local expendi\u00ad tures for child welfare services may not be less than such expenditures were for the year ending June 30, 1966. 4. SERVICES TO CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE STATE To be eligible for funds, a State must have a plan for a comprehensive child\u00ad welfare program-a program that would include services to help children remain in their own homes as well as foster-care services. The plan must meet Federal requirements that are essentially the same as those already est\u00b7ablished-by the 1962 amendments of the Social Se-curity Act, part IV. They include the important proviso that the program must extend throughout all political sub\u00ad divisions of the State. That is, services must be provided for children in all counties of the State. 5. GRANTS FOR EXPERIMENTATION Federal project grants would be avail\u00ad able to States for developing and main\u00ad taining new or experimental forms of child-welfare services, including _ services for children with special needs. Such grants would give States a specific incentive to develop new projects and to try them out within a limited local area, thus encouraging experimentation with programs that have not been sufficiently tested to justify their application on a statewide basis. Mr. President, we should remember that in half the counties of the Nation there are presently no child-welfare services. We should also not lose sight of the fact that there are thousands of homes in our land where the abilities of parents to cope with the problems of their children are extremely limited, either by reasons of health, income or inability. This legislation would give parents a modicum of help presently un\u00ad available which would aid them in meet\u00ad ing their needs as parents. The expenditures under this measure could be called a capital investment in the future. For better child-welfare services today would mean a healthier citizenry, both physically and mentally, in the future. Mr. President, I hope that this pro\u00ad posal will meet with early and approving consideration by the Senate, for there can be no more fitting memorial to John E. Fogarty than its enactment. I ask that the full text of the proposed legisla\u00ad tion be printed at the conclusion of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately referred; and, without objection, the bill Will be printed in the RECORD. The bill <S. 1116) to amend title V of the Social Security Act so as to ex\u00ad tend and improve the.

Mr. President, 1n 1949, during the 81st Congress, a b111 was first February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4665 introduced in the Senate to promote Comdr. Edward White Rawlins to the rank of captain in the U.S. Navy. A sub\u00ad committee of the Senate Armed Services Committee held hearings on the bill. The basic justification of that bill was that the Wartime Promotion Panels con\u00ad sidering Rawlins' promotion acted has\u00ad tily and without consideration of all rele\u00ad vant documentation. Moreover, the one apparently unfavorable item in Rawlins' record at the time he was being consid\u00ad ered for promotion-an unenthusiastic fitness report from an immediate supe\u00ad rior-was later withdrawn by the su\u00ad perior. The Navy Department stated, at the 1949 hearings, that it agreed Commander Rawlins' record has no blemish. The Armed Services subcommittee concluded that there was considerable merit to the claim that an injustice had been done to Commander Rawlins by his promotion denial-Senate Report No. 562, 81st Con\u00ad gress, first session. A House Committee considering this matter in 1950 found that: There is ample evidence in the record that Commander Rawlins may have suffered due to an administrative error. It appears that a letter was missing from his file whic:h would have refuted a detrimental statement concerning him (H. Rep. No. 3012, 81st Cong., 2nd Sess.). Commander Rawlins' claim for promo\u00ad tion has been supported by an impressive number of Navy flag officers, including Adm. Robert B. Carney, and Adm. Louis Denfeld, both former Chiefs of Naval Operations. The Rawlins' promotion bill was not passed by the Congress during the 81st Congress, though the Senate passed a bill which would have required the Navy to reopen his case, among others. In the 83d Congress, the Senate passed a bill promoting Commander Rawlins to captain, but the House refused to accept it. In 1955, during the 84th Congress, hearings were again held on this issue, and at that time a subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee con\u00ad cluded that whatever injustice may have been caused Commander Rawlins by his promotion denial was no greater than the possible injustice to other o:mcers denied promotion by the Wartime Pro\u00ad motion Panels. Specifically, this sub\u00ad committee found that whatever docu\u00ad ments were absent from Rawlins' file when his promotion was being considered would have had no material impact on his promotion request. The Senate took no action on Rawlins' relief bill. This matter did not end here. In 1961, another private bill was introduced on Rawlins' behalf, and the Navy then agreed to set up a special board to re\u00ad consider Rawlins' claim. That board refused to give Rawlins the rank of cap\u00ad tain. Rawlins claims, however, that this board failed to take into account that his early unenthusiastic fitness report had been retracted by the reporting of\u00ad fleer and that the board did not have available other evidence of Rawlins' fit\u00ad ness for promotion. Moreover, Rawlins was not permitted to appear before the board, with or without representation by counsel. It should be noted that if the Navy had not convened a special panel to con\u00ad sider Rawlins' claim, but rather per\u00ad mitted his claim to go before the board for correction of Navy records-as it has done in cases similar to Rawlins-then Rawlins would have had the right to testify in person, to be accompanied by counsel, to introduce witnesses, and to present all available new evidence in his behalf. Mr. President, this case has a long his\u00ad tory. It seems to me desirable that Rawlins should be given a \"day in court\" so that the conflicting factual allegations and conflicting views of the equities of the situation can be sorted out. During the 89th Congress, the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judiciay Machinery, of which I am chairman, of the Senate Ju\u00ad diciary Committee did considerable work on a bill to provide for reference of pri\u00ad vate bills to the commissioners of the court of claims. My SIUbcommittee believed that Con\u00ad gress could benefit greatly by receiving the impartial judgment of these commis\u00ad sioners regarding private bills to remedy apparent inequities, particularly where conflicting factual allegations are in\u00ad volved. I am pleased that the Congress enacted this legislation. I believe the machinery set up by that legislation for reference of private bills is most appropriate for the bill I introduced to\u00ad day, on behalf of Commander Rawlins. Accordingly, I am also submitting a Senate resolution, referring the Rawlins bill to the chief commissioner of the court of claims, for findings regarding the equities of that bill and a report to the Senate at the earliest practicable date. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately re\u00ad ferred; and, without objection, the reso\u00ad lution will be received and appropriately referred. The bill <S. 1122) for the relief of Comdr. Edward White Rawlins, U.S. Navy <retired), was received, read twice by its title, and referred to the Commit\u00ad tee on the Judiciary. The resolution <S. Res. 90) was re\u00ad ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary, as follows: S. RES. 90 Resolved, That the b111 (S. 1122) entitled \"A b111 for the relief of Commander Edward White Rawlins, United States Navy (re\u00ad tired)\", now pending in the Senate, together with all accompanying papers, is hereby re\u00ad ferred to chief commissioner of the United states Court of Claims pursuant to sections 1492 and 2509 of title 28, United States Code; and the court shall proceed expeditiously with the same in accordance with the pro\u00ad visions of said sections and shall report to the senate, at the earliest practicable date, its findings of fact and conclusions thereon as shall be sufficient to inform the Congress (a) of the nature and character of his demand, as a claim legal or equitable, against the United States, (b) whether Commander Rawlins suffered nonpromotion to the grade of captain as a probable consequence of any arbitrary, capricious, inadvertent, improper, inequitable, or wrongful act or action or combinations thereof by or within the De\u00ad partment of the Navy, and (c) in such event, the amount legally or equitably due from the United States to the claimant, notwith\u00ad standing the lapse of time and any statute of limitations or laches. FIRE RESEARCH AND SAFETY ACT OF 1967 Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the senior Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. COTTON] I send to the desk, for appropriate ref\u00ad erence, the proposed Fire Research and Safety Act of 1967. One of the earliest and one of the most important discoveries of mankind was the use of fire. Yet throughout history, fire has also posed a threat to man, when it is an uncontrolled and unwanted fire. Some fires have gone down in history\u00ad the great fire of London in the 13th cen\u00ad tury, for example. Other fires receive scant attention in the daily newspapers. Yet to the victims of fire, the results are equally tragic. It is ironic that here in the United States, with all of our vast technical know-how, the per capita death rate from fire is four times as high as the rate in the United Kingdom and more than six times as great as the rate in Japan. President Johnson, in his message, \"To Protect the American Consumer\" said: \"We can do better, and we must.\" These are my sentiments, exactly. I have therefore introduced a bill, the Fire Research and Safety Act of 1967, which is designed to help cut down the toll of 12,000 lives and $1% billion in property losses that the Nation suffers each year as a result of fires. There is not a Member of this body who has not come into contact, directly or indirectly, with the human tragedy behind the grim statistics. Earlier this month, in the Lake Stevens area of Snohomish County in my home State of Washington, a fire in the middle of the night took the lives of an entire family\u00ad mother, father, and three little chil\u00ad dren. The children never even had a chance to get out of their beds. And this is not an exceptional case. A casual glance at newspapers around the coun\u00ad try would reveal many similar stories of tragedy and loss. There are a number of public and pri\u00ad vate institutions that are active in the field of fire safety. Without their ef\u00ad forts, the situation today would no doubt be much worse than it is. However, there is still much more that needs to be done. We are making no headway at the present time in reducing the per capita death rate from fires. Moreover, the number of fires per capita and the property damage per capita have in\u00ad creased during the past 5 years. Obvi\u00ad ously, something must be done to correct this deteriorating situation. The bill I have introduced would amend the Organic Act of the National Bureau of Standards to authorize a com\u00ad prehensive fire research and safety pro\u00ad gram. This objective would be accom\u00ad plished through support and expansion of existing public and private programs \u00b7, wherever possible. Specifically, the proposed program would include: First, investigation of the incidence of fires, and research on the causes of fires; second, education of the public on fire hazards and safety tech\u00ad niques; education of firemen on fire\u00ad fighting methods including the develop-4666 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 ment of fire safety courses; third, refer\u00ad ence and data services to provide infor\u00ad mation \u00b7 on all aspects of fire safety; fourth, support for demonstration proj\u00ad ects on improved methods for the preven\u00ad tion and control of-fires, and for projects designed to improve fire services; and fifth, grants to State and local govern\u00ad ments, and to other public and nonprofit institutions for the purpose of achieving the objectives outlined in the bill. I believe that the proposed program is a well thought out approach to a diffi\u00ad cult and complex problem. It may be that some fires cannot be avoided, as, for example, those started by lightning and other natural causes. Nevertheless, most of the causes of fires are related to human carelessness in the highly technological and potentially hazardous environment we have created for ourselves in the 20th century. In my opinion, the problem of fire safety is a perfect example of a prob\u00ad lem which can best be resolved throug}l the cooperative efforts of public and pri\u00ad vate organizations, and through a work\u00ad ing partnership of government at all levels, Federal.- State, and local. The bill I have proposed takes just such an approach. I urge all Members to study the proposals carefully, and I believe the public interest will be well served through swift enactment of this legis\u00ad lation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the text of the bill be printed at the close of my remarks, together with a statement of purpose and need and a brief summary of the proposed national fire safety program. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately re\u00ad ferred; and, without objection, the bill, statement of purpose, and a summary of the proposed national fire safety program, will be printed in the RECORD. The bill (8. 1124) to amend the Or\u00ad ganic Act of the National Bureau of Standards to authorize a fire research and safety program, and for other pur\u00ad poses, introduced by Mr. MAGNUSON (for himself and Mr. COTTON), was received, read twice by its title, referred to the Committee on Commerce, and ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: s. 1124 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of. the United States of America in Congress assembled, Tha.t this Act be cited as the \"Fire Research and Safety Act of 1967.\" DECLARATION OF POLICY SEC. 2. Congress finds that a comprehen\u00ad sive fire research and safety program is needed in this country to provide more ef\u00ad fective measures of protection against the hazards of death, injury and damage to property. The Congress finds that it is de\u00ad sirable and necessary for the Federal Govern\u00ad ment, in carrying out the provisions of this Act, to cooperate with and assist public and private agencies. The Congress declares that the purpose of this Act .is to amend the Act of March 3, 1901, as amended, to provide a national fire research and safety program including the gathering of comprehensive fire data; a comprehensive fire research pro\u00ad gram; fire safety education and training pro\u00ad grams; demonstrations of new approaches and improvements in fire prevention, control and. reduction of death, personal injury and property damage. Additionally , it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary should establish a fire research and safety center for administering this Act and carrying out its purposes, including appropriate fire safety liaison and coordination. FIRE RESEARCH AND SAFETY AMENDMENTS SEc. 3. The Act entitled \"An Act to estab\u00ad lish the National Bureau of Standards\" ap\u00ad proved March 3, 1901, as amended ( 15 U.S.C. 271-278e) is further amended by adding the following sections: \"SEc. 16.

Nothing contained in this Act sball be deemed to repeal, supersede, or diminish existing authority or responsib111ty of any agency or instrumentality of the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment . AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS SEC. 5. There are authorized to be appro\u00ad priated for the purposes of this Act, $10,000,- 000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1968, and such sums a.S may be necessary for each of the following four fiscal years, and such appropriations are authorized to be made without fiscal year limitations. The statement of purpose and need, and the national fire safety program presented by Mr. MAGNUSON are as fol\u00ad lows: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND NEED This proposed \"Fire Research and Safety Act of 1967\" would amend the Organic Act of the National Bureau of Standards to au\u00ad thorize a comprehensive fire research and safety program to gather comprehensive fire data, conduct intensive fire research, educate and train in fire protection and safety and support demonstrations of improved and ex\u00ad perimental fire protection and safety. The best estimates available indicate that in 1965, fire in the United States caused 12,100 deaths and property damage amount\u00ad ing to $1,741,300,000 or ($8.98 for every man, woman, and child). Our per capita fire death rate is twice Canada's rate, four times the rate for the United Kingdom, and six and one-half times the rate for Japan. While our much higher per capita death rate may reflect the hazards that accompany our higher standard of living, this merely indi\u00ad cates that we must put forth greater fire safety efforts as our living standards rise; 1! we are to eliminate excessive loss of life to fire. Over the past five years, the best privately estimated per capita fire death rate from all causes has remained relatively constant (al\u00ad though U.S. Public Health Service figures for non-transportation fires have increased nine percent). Over the same period the es\u00ad timated per capita number of fires in the United States has increased nine percent and the estimated per capita property damage has increased four percent. Our 1965 esti\u00ad mated per capita property damage contrasts with $6.85 for Canada, the next highest per capita loss among major countries. Japan, with a population of about one-half that of February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4667 the United States, has a per capita loss of only $1.32 and its total number of fires in 1965 is about one-fortieth of the number that occurred in the United States. The ravages of uncontrolled fires have dotted the pages of history from its begin\u00ad ning. Great fires that are well known go back at least to Nero's Rome in the middle of the first century. King John promulgated building ordinances to prevent the spread of fire between buildings after the London fire of 1212-three years before the Magna Charta. Research and testing of building constructions for fire resistance in this coun\u00ad try started early in the last century but remained at a very low level until the great fires in Chicago, Baltimore and San Fran\u00ad cisco, the last two in the first decade of this century. The resulting impetus to fire stud\u00ad lea has lead to a more systematic approach and to the present collection of standard test methods. \u00b7At about the same time that fire testing and research was beginning to grow, the gathering of fire information and attempts at public education on fire safety took on a new stature. The National Fire Protec\u00ad tion Association, founded in 1896, is the chief source for educational materials and consolidated fire information. ROLE OF FIRE IN PUBLIC SAFETY Fire strikes at man both physically and economically. There is no place or time when he may safely relax his guard. His homes, places of amusement, cities, trans\u00ad portation, and national resources are all vul\u00ad nerable to fire. Fires start from natural causes such as lightning, but most causes are related to man's carelessness among the hazardous surroundings he has made for himself. Fires in homes and apartments take many lives every year. Tragedies strike in places of public assembly despite laws and recom\u00ad mendations on construction, decoration, oc\u00ad cupancy, and means of egress. Large losses o~ life have occurred in just the past few years as a result of fires in schools, hospi\u00ad tals, hotels, and restaurants. The recent tragedy in a penthouse restaurant in Mont\u00ad gomery, Alabama, took 25 lives. Without the significant efforts of private and public organizations in the field of fire safety, the record would be much worse. However, this record can and should ~ im\u00ad proved. Greater support of fire safety pro\u00ad grams will be needed, if such improvement is to be achieved. The Federal Government should provide needed support through a national fire safety program, including direct financial support of activities of private non\u00ad profit and public organizations, and increased Federal activities to provide technical sup\u00ad port for their programs. The national pro\u00ad gram should encourage local initiative by supporting improved methods and tech\u00ad niques for preventing and controlling fires, reducing personal injury and property dam\u00ad age, or improving the efficiency, operation or organization of the fire services. Comprehensive and detailed Information on fire causes and effects is essential to the best use of available resources to minimize the harm from fires. These resources must be directed to the most significant areas of the overall problem, which are only par\u00ad tially identified at present. For example, present fire cause data are not detailed enough to permit analysis to determine where research and other activities will be most beneficial. Similarly, education in fire safe\u00ad ty and protection is hindered by a lack of detailed information on the nature and scope of the problem. INFORMATXON Our present national efforts to gather in\u00ad formation on fire causes and effects are carried on by private organizations. These organizations depend on voluntary coopera\u00ad tion of their members and others who are interested enough to provide reports. The National Fire Protection Association is gen\u00ad erally recognized as having the best com\u00ad pilation of data on fire causes and losses of life and property. Despite diligent effort on the Association's part, however, it receives statewide loss data from only about half of the States, and data on causes from about one-third of the States. The present NFPA budget, derived from members' dues plus the sale of publications cannot support staff operations in the field to gather directly the data which is not supplied to the Association. Nor can the Association appeal to any incen\u00ad tive for cooperation in the data gathering other than a common Interest In fire safety. Another group gathering data Is the Insur\u00ad ance industry. However, their primary in\u00ad terest is in the area of establishing insur\u00ad ance rates, and their data, and analyses thereof, are of appropriately limited scope. We need more fire information than vol\u00ad untary efforts have been able to gather. The proposed legislation would authorize Federal support that could be used to increase that level of effort significantly. Voluntary and :uniform reporting of fire information could be achieved by grants to local organizations. The information gathering program would utilize a stanqardized reporting system, and one or more \u00b7teams of experts to investigate selected fires in depth and evaluate and im\u00ad prove the reporting system. There would also be a clearinghouse service for fire in\u00ad formation, which would maintain a com\u00ad prehensive libr,ary, provide materials and an abstract service, publish bibliographies and maintain roosters of those having highly specialized expertise. The information gathered under this pro\u00ad gram would aid in planning, research, and in providing fire safety education. The clearinghouse service would furnish useful fire information to the fire service and others interested in fire safety throughout the country. RESEARCH The present research effort is carried on by fire equipment and building materials in\u00ad dustries, trade associations, universities, non\u00ad profit organizations, commercial laboratories, and Government agencies. The industry and trade association research, for the most part, is of an applied, product-oriented nature. Individual companies conduct little basic re\u00ad search. Industry has made use of trade as\u00ad sociations as a mechanism for industry-wide support of research on common problems. But this work also is predominantly applied research. Industry tends to look to those who are not profit motivated for the basic research information. The Federal Government's funding for fire research program is about six million dollars, concentrated mainly in the Forest Service and Department of Defense, the latter in\u00ad cluding the Office of Civil Defense. Smaller amounts go to the National Bureau of Stand\u00ad ards, National Science Foundation, Bureau of Mines, and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The research of the Government agencies is largely mission\u00ad oriented, and not applicable to many com\u00ad mon fire safety problems. The primary deficiency of these research programs is that inadequate attention is given to establishing an understanding of th\u00b7e basic nature and behavior of fire upon which could be based a theory and mo!l'e effi\u00ad cient practi~ of fire prevention and con\u00ad trol. Instead, great reliance is placed on the less efficient method of empirical fire testing, to dete!l'mine the fire resistance of various materials: The number of samples of build\u00ad ing matedals and assemblies that can be fire te&ted is limited because of cost, thus re\u00ad stricting teohnologioal innovations in the building industry. A majO!l' research gap is in the area of fire department operations. The need f\u00b7O!l' re\u00ad search here is becoming critical. Increasing costs of operating community services, the trend to great agglomeration of communities into metropolitan regions, and the rapid so\u00ad cial and technological change are imposing demands on fire services fO!l' greater efficiency. In rural areas, the longer distances and un\u00ad certain water supplies, plus the hazard orf large quantities of stored combustible agri\u00ad cultural products on :many fanns, place great demands on local fire services. The legislation will authorize additional research nearly equal to the present Fede!l'lal level immediately, much orf which will be used, through contracts, to support funda\u00ad mental studies in the universities and other non-Fede'l'al facilities. There would also be development of improved methods and tech\u00ad niques fO!l' preventing and oontrolllng fires, and for rehabilitating injured pe!l'Sons and damaged property. EDUCATION The National Fire ~rotection Association, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the National Safety Council each has a national progi\"am in fire prevention educa\u00ad tion. Of these, NFP A's is the largest and in\u00ad cludes Spring Clean-Up Week and Fire Pre\u00ad vention Week in October. GoveTnment and local public education programs are gener\u00ad ally related to the national prograins and make use orf their educational literature. Despite these efforts at public education, many members of the public are complacent and do not take tlle precautions needed to reduce the occurrences of fires caused by carelessness. Inadequate financial resources now preclude existing programs from fully effective use of mass communication media and of other public educational activities. The legislation would authorize gl\"ants to s1late and local fire service groups and sup\u00ad port to national fire education groups for public fire safety education. It will also authorize Federal technical support of such educational activities. Insufficient attention is given to fire p!l'e\u00ad vention eduoation in our institutions of higher learning. Engineering, architecture, city planning and comparable curricula should include fire problems and design ap\u00ad proaches that will minimize fire occurrence and spread. Such design should become an integral part of the overall practice of those professions. Specialized training in the sci\u00ad entific and engineering aspects of fire protec\u00ad tion are also needed. Only two universities offer four-year curricula leading to degrees in fire protection engineering. The proposed legislation would authorize gmnts for the development of curricula and oourse mate\u00ad rilal to faoiUtate the establishment of fire protection curricula in additional colleges or universities, and facilitate the introduction of fire protection courses in other curricula. Most professional fire personnel lack suf\u00ad ficient training in command and control of disaster operations and in the control of special hazards. Education and training is essential to attainment of the highest levels of competence for the fire services. Many states have fire service schools offering short courses. However, the content and amount of training varies from state to state, and even within states since individual partici\u00ad pation in some cases is dependent on the availability of local funds. The proposed legislation would authorize grants and sup\u00ad port of the development of and participation in professional extension courses for fire service personnel and officers. We believe the objective should be .th~ establishment of a program of periodic professional train\u00ad ing for all fire services personnel, and for the staff of State Fire Marshals Offices or other offices whose responsibilities have sig\u00ad nificant relationship to fire. Such increased education should enhance professional stat\u00ad ure and encourage career and executive de\u00ad velopment in the fire services, thereby attracting greater numbers of highly quali\u00ad fied individuals to this important area of public service. 4668 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS Many interested firemen and other public spirited individuals have applied themselves to problems of public education, fire safety, and fire department operations. Frequently, these individuals have not been able to sup\u00ad port, or find support for, practical demonstra\u00ad tions of the feasib111ty of improved training aids, operational procedures, public educa\u00ad tion programs, or other fire safety methods and techniques. ldeas for useful demonstra\u00ad tion will also result from Federal fire safety activities. The proposed legislation would authorize Federal support of appropriate demonstrations, and thus would encourage local and individual initiative in the solu\u00ad tion of fire safety problems. NATIONAL FIRE RESEARCH AND SAFETY CENTER This proposed legislation would state the sense of Congress that the Secretary should establish a fire research and safety center. While much of the research under this pro\u00ad gram will be performed outside the Federal Government or in other Federal fac1lities, neither private nor Government fac111ties in this country are equipped for certain kinds of research, such as growth and spread of fires within full-scale multistory buildings or the interactions among structural ele\u00ad ments under fire conditions. The results of these and similar studies could lead to ad\u00ad vanced design practices reducing the likeli\u00ad hood and spread of fires. Consequently an advanced research center is needed for per\u00ad formance of such fundamental studies. Additionally, the center would provide a central focus for management of the national fire safety program under this proposed leg\u00ad islation. By establishing close contact with research personnel, the center would facili\u00ad tate development of necessary staff com\u00ad petence for both technical support of non\u00ad Federal activities and scientific management of contracts and grants. Finally, the program also would utilize fully existing competence and facilities of other Federal agencies, and would be coordi\u00ad nated carefully with related existing Federal programs. NATIONAL FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM Comprehensive program is needed to pro\u00ad vide better protection against deaths, injur\u00ad ies, and property damage caused by fire. This objective should be accomplished through support and expansion of existing public and private programs, wherever possible. New program would include: 1. Investigation and Research: Investigation of causes, frequency, severity, and other important data. Research on causes of fires; development of better methods for fire prevention, control, and rehab111tation of affected people and property. 2. Education of the public on hazards, safety techniques, etc.; of firemen on tech\u00ad niques, etc.; and developing fire safety cur\u00ad ricula and courses. 3. Information: Reference and data services on all aspects of fire safety. 4. Support for Demonstration Projects on improved methods for prevention, control, re\u00ad hab111tation and improving fire services. 5. Grants to State and local governments, other public and non-profit institutions. THE SLAUGHTER OF ELK IN YEL ... LOWSTONE ~ATIONAL PARK Mr. HANSEN. Mr. President, again this year the National Park Service has taken its riflemen and skinning crews to Yellowstone National Park for the pur\u00ad pose of slaughtering the magnificent elk which range there. Yesterday, the Service announced, through gunfire that echoed south from the park, that the so-called direct re\u00ad duction program-that is to say, kill\u00ad ing-of Yellowstone elk was again under\u00ad way after a brief pause called either to cool the rifles from earlier killing or to evaluate the strenuous objections elicit\u00ad ed by the slaughter . To date, some 15,000 elk have been \"directly reduced\" by the National Park \u00b7 Service since that expedient was first be\u00ad gun three decades ago. I am compelled to comment on the killing of the magnificent Yellowstone elk, to ask that an editorial from the Wyoming State Tribune be printed in the REcORD at the conclusion of my com\u00ad ments, and to submit for consideration by the Senate a resolution which seeks alternatives to direct reduction. Mr. President, the recent brief pause in the killing to which I referred was ostensibly for the purpose of studying other remedies to the park's elk-versus\u00ad food problem. After a short study by a Dr. Cowan, Mr. Starker Leopold, and Mr. Tom Kim\u00ad ball, two of whom were members of a similar blue ribbon study commission ap\u00ad pointed 4 or 5 years ago, the Park Service has come to the judgment that it must resume killing. Six hundred elk are slated for slaughter. Some 10 days ago, I had announced my hope that this study group would flnd better ways to bring about elk re\u00ad duction without the necessity of slaugh\u00ad ter. Now the study group has simply confirmed the long-established and un\u00ad deviating position taken by the National Park Service. I think it is extremely regrettable that the Park Service has not called upon the expertise and talents of other inter\u00ad ested parties in this controversy. I speak of our Wyoming Game and Fish Commission-one of the best State agen\u00ad cies in this country-and of our com\u00ad mission's sister agency in the State of Montana. I speak also of the invaluable advice that could be given by local citizens in\u00ad timately involved with the management of our wildlife resources. These groups hruve made a number of excellent sug\u00ad gestions, all worthy, I believe, of atten\u00ad tion by the National Park Service. Among these suggestions is the possi\u00ad bility of improving the live trap program by placing traps, portable or otherwise, in areas of the park where they are not presently available. Part and parcel of this approach would be the use of hay to further bait animals toward these traps and the driving of animals from inaccessible areas by helicopter. Another suggestion with great merit would question the inflexible and arbi\u00ad trary control program presently ad\u00ad vocated by the Park Service. To estab\u00ad lish a maximum elk population at 5,000 head without regard to changing range conditions, snow conditions and hunter harvests defies both good management principles and commonsense. The Park Service claims that the present elk slaughter does not constitute an emer\u00ad gency, but if this is not an emergency, I do not know what is. Further, the Park Service will find itself confronted with recurring emergencies of just this sort if it persists in sticking by a magical limit of 5,000 head. I would respectfully suggest that the Park Service should consider the advisa\u00ad bility of maintaining the northern Yel\u00ad lowstone-Upper Lamar elk herd be\u00ad tween approximate maximum and mini\u00ad mum limitations. This would then allow the Federal officials flexibility in man\u00ad agement. The conditions in the moun\u00ad tains and plateaus of Yellowstone Park today recommend this approach. The Park Service has admitted that the elk are now wintering in scattered bands on high and inaccessible wind\u00ad blown ridges. It is certain that if the elk are truly scattered then a minimum amount of damage will be done to the winter range this year. If, next year or the year after, a heavy early snowfall serves to drive the elk to lower altitudes in concentrated bands, then the Park Service could pursue an intensive live trapping program that would cut back the excess numbers allowed on the range this winter. These four things, then, I believe could be offered as a direct answer to the elk slaughter situation with which the Park Service finds itself confronted: First. Revision of management policy to allow for a more flexible range of elk numbers. Second. Greater cooperation between the National Park Service and Wyoming and Montana citizens and game agencies. Third. Intensification of a more effec\u00ad tive live trap method. Fourth. More effective hunter harvest outside of Yellowstone Park. Mr. President, I submit a resolution which I hope will express the concensus of the Senate that methods other than direct reduction are deserving of further exploration by the National Park Service in its effort to limit the size of the Yellow\u00ad stone elk herds. The essence of this resolution is that the National Park Service ought to meet in a dispassionate and constructive at\u00ad mosphere with the States contiguous to Yellowstone National Park to work out alternatives to direct reduction, that the Service ought to apprise the States and the appropriate committees of Con\u00ad gress of precisely what it is costing the taxpayers to slaughter the elk and what it might cost them to employ other methods to achieve the same end, and that, for the present at least, the killing ought to be stopped. As I have stated, I will do everything in my power to assist the Park Service in securing funds for any control pro\u00ad gram which envisions alternatives to direct reduction and my office stands ready ever to promote cooperation be\u00ad tween the \"Yellowstone States\" and the Federal Government. It is time now to substitute reason for rifles in Yellowstone National Park. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be received and appro\u00ad priately referred; and, without objec\u00ad tion, the resolution and editorial will be printed in the RECORD. The resolution (8. Res. 91) was re\u00ad referred to the CQmmittee on Interior and Insular Affairs, as follows: February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4669 S. RES. 91 Whereas the people of the United States, and particularly the Rocky Mountain States, are appalled that in this age of sophisticated management techniques, the alternative of slaughter is the principal means whereby the National Park Service has been able to keep within manageable limits the number of elk in Yellowstone National Park; Whereas in the past three decades fifteen thousand elk have been killed in Yellow\u00ad stone Park, reducing greatly the magnifi\u00ad cance of the wildlife herds in that area; Whereas the National Park Service has refused to justify the present practice of slaughtering elk by a cost\u00b7 analysis and a logical and comprehensive management plan and has failed to sufficiently consider alternative management techniques such as increased live trapping, and a concerted ef\u00ad fort to encourage the migration of elk out of Yellowstone Park during the fall of each year; Whereas the National Park Service has demonstrated its disinclination to discuss alternatives to the satisfaction of the Game and Fish agencies of the several States con\u00ad tiguous to Yellowstone Park; Resolved, That the National Park Service be prohibited in 1967 from further imple\u00ad mentation of its herd management program for Yellowstone Park through the expedient of wha;t is known as direct reduction; that the National Park Service submi\u00b7t to the appropriate Committees of Congress and to the Governors of States contiguous to Yel\u00ad lowstone Park, in writing, cost analyses com\u00ad paring the several alternatives to direct re\u00ad duction, together with a logical and compre\u00ad hensive long-range management plan; that the appropriate officials of the National Park Service or its parent agency, the Department of the Interior, meet in an atmosphere of cooperation to discuss to the satisfaction of all parties the several alternatives to direct reduction; that the Congress will be on rec\u00ad ord as opposing the elk herd management expedient known as direct reduction, unless the Interior Department and the Governors of the States involved shall agree that it is the most efficacious, economical and de\u00ad sirable alternative available for such control. The editorial presented by Mr. HANSEN is-as follows: THE PEACE THAT DIDN'T LAST It is to be hoped that the U.S. will secure a more lasting peace in Vietnam than the Great Elk war of Wyoming. We thought this confiict had been settled four years ago, and so noted in an editorial on Jan. 11, 1963, the day following an an\u00ad nouncement by Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall in Washington that the National Park Service had capitulated to the People's Army of Wyoming, captained by Sen. Milward L. Simpson and Gov. Cliff Han\u00ad sen. For those who are not up to date on this contest, which has covered almost as long a period as the Punic Wars, the Great Elk war had raged for years over a policy by the National Park Service and carried out ex\u00ad clusively, insofar as we have been able to de\u00ad termine, in Yellowstone National Park, of having park service rangers de-populate the Yellowstone elk herds by shooting the ex\u00ad cess animals. This shooting program has involved num\u00ad bers ranging from several hundred to several thousand per year; and it gradually evolved from a cold war into a hot one with the passage of time, until in the winter of 1961- 62 and 1962-63 things got pretty sticky. It now appears the only mistake we made was not in bombing their principal cities and throwing a naval blockade around Mam\u00ad moth Hot Springs. As a private citizen, Milward Simpson in December, 1961, tried but failed to obtain a federal court injunction against the Yel-lowstone park superintendent in an effort to halt the shooting; but in the following year he was elected to the United States Senate, and being on a little higher ground and with the considerable assistance of Cliff Hansen, who had been elected governor at the same time, the Park Service saw it was losing the battle. On Jan. 30, 1963, the Park Service, accord- \u00b7 ing to our somewhat inadequate files, called for a Panmunjom type conference in the governor's conference chamber here to dis\u00ad cuss the value of the National Park Service to the state of Wyoming. While this parley was in the process of discussing some of the finer points of the law, Secretary Udall in Washington issued a surprise announcement saying the Park Service was giving up the elk killing. This news was greeted by all sorts of joyous reactions. Simpson and Hansen is\u00ad sued statements saying how pleased they were, and editorialists (including this one) praised the Great Day saying it hadn't been expected but since it had arrived, why wel\u00ad come, and all that. Four years later, almost exactly, plus a week or so, we are sadly disillusioned. The Park Service says it will resume shooting elk because there are too many, they are de\u00ad stroying the natural habitat, and the only way to get rid of them is by slaughter. We should like to point out the trouble with India is that there are too many In\u00ad dians, too, but nobody has suggested shoot\u00ad ing them; instead President Johnson is sending them 2,000,000 tons of wheat. May\u00ad be we ought to send the elk some wheat, too; that way they won't browse so vigorously and destroy the rangeland in Yellowstone; the wheat farmers will be happy, the Park Service people and the anti-elk killers will be satisfied, and no doubt the elk will be, too. Nobody has asked them their choice in the matter but it is to be assumed they'd rather dine on a sack of wheat shorts, than be confronted with a rifietoting ranger out for their hides (and tallow, too) . No, doubt, our advice will not be accepted in this respect; so we must sadly assume that judging from yesterday's press accounts, the great fracas will be re-played with a slight change in the cast of characters. The Park Service's theater commander, Yellowstone Superintendent Lemuel Garri\u00ad son, has gone on to other fields, to be re\u00ad placed by a new man. Mr. Simpson is no longer in the Senate, but it might be ob\u00ad served that he is even closer to the firing line than he was in Washington, and he already has gotten off one salvo from Litchfield Park, Ariz., where he is getting a bit of the Arizona sun. While the fires of battle are stirring Mil\u00ad ward, his second-in-command in the Battle of 1961-63, Cliff Hansen, holds Simpson's old job in Washington, and the latter has been succeeded by a worthy contender in his own right, Stan the Man. Therefore, it appears we're headed back to the war, and if somebody doesn't do some\u00ad thing quick-like getting Senator Fulbright or Walter Lippmann out here-things are apt to get mighty bad. Before it is over, we should like to predict, there will be other bodies dragged off the field of battle than those of elk. CHANGE OF REFERENCE Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance be disc.harged from consideration of the bill, S. 1032, to provide for the disregarding, for pur\u00ad poses of determining need under pro\u00ad grams established pursuant to the pub\u00ad lic assistance titles of the Social Security Act, of\u00b7 certain income of. aged persons employed under programs receiving as-sistance under the Older Americans Act of 1965, and that the bill be referred to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS OF BILLS Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at its next printing, the name of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. RANDOLPH] be added as.a cosponsor of the bill (S. 428) to amend the Elemen\u00ad tary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 in order to provide assistance to local educational agencies in establish\u00ad ing bilingual American education pro\u00ad grams, and to provide certain other as\u00ad sistance to promote such programs.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. NOTICE OF HEARINGS ON MISCEL\u00ad LANEOUS BANKING AND CREDIT UNION BILLS Mr. PROXMIRE, Mr. President, I would like to announce that the Suboom\u00ad mittee on Financial Institutions of the Committee on Banking and Currency will hold hearings on March 14 on three bills: S. 714 consists of two sections. The first deals with loans to executive officers by member banks of the Federal Reserve System; it passed the Senate in 1965 as S. 1558, but did not become law. The second section amends the Federal Credit Union Act to modify loan provisions re\u00ad lating to directors and members of the supervisory and credit committees of Federal credit unions; S. 965 would authorize Federal Reserve banks to invest in certain obligations of foreign governments. It passed the Sen\u00ad ate in 1965 as S. 1557 but did not become law; S. 966 is known as the eligible paper bill. It passed the Senate in 1965 as S. 1559 but also did not become law. 'J'he hearings on these three bills will begin at 10 a.m. in room 5302, New Sen- ate Office Building. \u00b7 Persons desiring to testify or to submit written statements in connection with these bills should notify Mr. Matthew Hale, Chief Counsel, Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, room 5300, New Senate Office Building, Washington.

PRINTED IN THE RECORD On request, and by unanimous con\u00ad sent, addresses, editorials, articles, etc., were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: By Mr. RANDOLPH: Telegram of congratulations by him to Dr. Jame.s Madison Nabrit, Jr., president of Howard University, Washington , D.C., dated February 27, 1967. UNANIMOUS-CONSENT ' AGREEMENT Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I have discussed with the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. CLARK], the distinguished chairman of the Com\u00ad mittee on Armed Services [Mr. RussELL], and my distinguished colleague, the senior senator from Illinois, the minority leader [Mr. DIRKSEN], the possibility of a time limitation on the amendments which will be offered to the military pro\u00ad curement bill, the pending business in the Senate. With their full agreement, I ask unani\u00ad mous consent that, beginning at the con\u00ad clusion of morning business tomorrow. debate be limited to 1 hour on each amendment, the time to be equally di\u00ad vided, and that 4 hours of debate be allowed on the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I would add one reservation to that re\u00ad quest. I have not had an opportunity to confer with the distinguished Senator from Indiana [Mr. HARTKE]; and if he enters any objection insofar as the agree\u00ad ment applies to his amendment or amendments, I will move that the order be vacated with respect to his amend\u00ad ments. \u00b7 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that in the form of an amendment? Mr. MANSFIELD. No; that is in the form of a qualifying statement of intent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Montana advise the Chair if he wants the unanimous-consent agreement in the regular form? Mr. MANSFIELD. I do. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The unanimous-consent agreement, subsequently reduced to writing, is as follows: UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT Ordered, That, effective on March 1, 1967, at the conclusion of routine morning busi\u00ad ness, during the further consideration of the bill (S. 665) to authorize appropriations during the fiscal year 1967 for procurement of aircraft, missiles, and tracked combat vehicles, and research, development, test, evaluation, and military construction for the Armed Forces, and for other purposes, debate on any amendment, motion, or appeal, ex\u00ad cept a motion to lay on the table, shall be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the mover of any such amend\u00ad ment or motion and the majority leader: Provided, That in the event the majority leader is in favor of any EUCh amendment or motion, the time in opposition thereto shall be controlled by the minority leader or some Senator designated by him: Provided further. That no amendment that is not germane to the provisions of the said bill shall be re\u00ad ceived. 01\u00b7dered further, That on the question of the final passage of the said bill debate shall be limited to 4 hours, to be \u00b7equally divided and controlled, respectively, by the majority and minority leaders: Provided, That the said leaders, or either of them, may, from the time under their control on the passage of the said bill, allot additional time to any Senator during the consideration of any amendment, motion, or appeal. CIA CONTROVERSY MANY FACETED Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, the current controversy over the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency has many facets. One aspect of the matter was covered in the Carl T. Rowan column, \"In Defense of the CIA~s Undercover Links,\" in the February 26 issue of the Washington, D.C., Sunday Star, with the emphasis placed on the possibility that in pursuit of openness of action and undisciplined speech we may be exceeding prudence. Another aspect of the matter, the manner in which allied nations handle similar intelligence operations, was re\u00ad viewed on the same date in the Washing\u00ad ton, D.C., Post under the heading, \"Ofuer Democracies Do Their Spying in Dif\u00ad ferent Ways.\" I believe these areas of the current CIA furor deserve wider public attention, and I am providing these items for insertion in the RECORD. I ask unanimous consent that these articles be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Washington (D.C.) Star, Feb. 26, 1967] IN DEFENSE OF THE CIA's UNDERCOVER \"LINKS\" (By Carl T. Rowan) When the stream of criticism and con\u00ad tempt for the Central Intelligence Agency rolls so forcefully and resolutely, one risks all manner of \u00b7accusations if he moves against the tide. But move against it I must, for there are some tragic aspects of the furor over the CIA's financing student, labor and other pri\u00ad vate groups that have not been given ade\u00ad quate attention. Surely I break no vows of secrecy made in my government days if I say now that this string of \"exposes\" of CIA associations can go on and on. There are dozens of yet un\u00ad named groups that cooperated with CIA\u00ad simply because they believed it to be in their children's and the nation's interest. I admire one of them-the Hobby Founda\u00ad tion of Houston, Texas-for publicly ex\u00ad pressing pride in having cooperated. The disciplines of self-acclaimed intellec\u00ad tualism, or liqeralism, or idealism compel some people to deplore these private in\u00ad volvements in the dirty business of waging a cold war. They say the' health of the na\u00ad tion requires that our press, universities, students et al. remain \"free of government manipulation.\" I cannot understand the schizophrenia that has caused these purists to exempt the Federal Bureau of Investigation from criti\u00ad cism for so fang. The FBI has its hand, and agents, in far more domestic organizations than the CIA. But somehow the press and the public have accepted that as necessary to trap those frightful spies and saboteurs. It must be reckoned one of the great pub\u00ad lic relations failures of American history that the.CIA has not won acceptance for its clan\u00ad destine activities on the valid ground that it is fighting the same deadly. struggle as the FBI. ,As the tedious string of. \"revelations\" un\u00ad wipd~. \u00b7 I conclude that American opinion\u00ad molders have become almost as psychotic about \"the CIA\" as those foreigners who talk as though the agency is capable of over\u00ad throwing their governments on five minutes' notice. The harsh truth is that these exposures have destroyed the CIA as an effective in\u00ad strument in many arenas of the cold war that is still being waged furiously, despite the recent talk about \"detente.\" So what the Communists spent billions--unsuccess\u00ad fully-to do, we Americans, out of our ideal\u00ad ism, have delivered to them as a gift. It disturbs me that this rush to bare CIA \"links\" has\u00b7 tainted \"Crossroads Africa,\" the \"American Society for African Culture\" and other groups that have worked honestly and intelligently to keep alive in millions of Af\u00ad ricans a faith and hope in democracy. Sanctimonious, theoretical~y. correct argu\u00ad ments that \"private business and industry\" should have provided the funds demolish themselves against one hard fact: Business and industry had neither the interest, the attitudes nor the inclination to support these efforts properly . \u00b7 . It pothers m\u00ab;l that these \"revelations\" have comprom ised, perhaps fatally in some oases. hundreds of young men arid women who might have become leaders of the developing nations. The wounds intUcted upon the Alliance for Progress are grave. \u00b7Many a U.S. Peace Corps worker or diplo\u00ad mat, and numerous foreign scholars and labor leaders who have struggled. bravely in the cause of freedom, will have their integri;ty impugned and their futures jeopardized be\u00ad fore this great expose frizzles out. Sure, one can say the CIA built this colossal tragedy by wrongly involving all these peo\u00ad ples and groups in the first place. I say nonsense. Several\u00b7 presidents, sev\u00ad eral cabinets, dozens of congressmen and the leaders of all the groups involved went into this business with their eyes wide open. And it wasn't because of an ugly assumption that the ends justify the means, as some idealists argue. They made a practical recognition of the fact that the adversary bad already set the dirty rules of battle, so either we played by his rules or got our bl'ains beaten out. I can't find it in my journalistic heart to say the press is wrong to dredge up all it has about CIA \"covers.\" Yet, I have an uneasy feeling that in pursuit of a hallowed bit of journalistic dogma, we are slaying some dragons that will come back to haunt our progeny. I 'keep remembering President Kennedy saying to the American Newspaper Publish\u00ad ers Association in 1961: \"This nation's foes have openly boasted. of acquiring through our newspapers informa\u00ad tion they would otherwise hire agents to ac\u00ad quire through theft, bribery or espionage . : . \"Today no war has been declared-and however fierce the struggle, it may never be declared in traditional fas.hion ... \"If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever. posed a grea~r threat to our security.\" February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4671 Is it heresy for me to ask whether the bene\u00ad fits to \"freedom\" accruing from these exposes of the CIA are great enough to balru1ce out the damage done to our security? (From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Feb. 26, 1967] OTHER DEMOCR ACIES Do THEIR SPYING IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN BRITAIN, THEY KEEP QUIET (By Karl E. Meyer) LoNDON~A fundamental difference be\u00ad tween British and American intelligence or\u00ad ganizations was proclaimed last week on thousands of newsstands throughout Britain. On the cover of the international editjon of Time magazine was a portrait of Richard Helms, the director of the Central Intelli\u00ad gence Agency. No British magazine or news\u00ad paper could be expected to carry a similar picture of Helms' counterpart here. This name of the chief of MI-6, Britain's CIA, is never published , and indeed is not even known by the vast majority of the populace. Even Members of Parliament and ambassa\u00ad dors profess ignorance of his identity. He is simply \"X\" or, as every movie goer knows, \"M.\" The paucity of infor-mation about. MI-6 makes it extremely difficult to offer any ob\u00ad jective comparison between its efficacy and that of CIA. One observation can be safely made. Whether MI-6 is be'tter or worse than the CIA, it is surely different. And so are the countries they serve. \u00b7 Compared to America, Britain is a homo\u00ad geneous society accustomed to rule by a tra\u00ad ditional elite. It is more like a cozy club than a railway terminal. The club's inner circle is accustomed to work in discreet in\u00ad timacy, arranging with a hint what in Amer\u00ad ica requires an act of Congress . It can be assumed that over the years covert assistance has been given to private organizations e~gaged in cold war hostilities. But it can also be assumed that most of this aid will not become publicly ~nown for dec- ades. The D-notice Secrecy is enforced not only through tradi\u00ad tion. The government can use an official secrets act to close blurting Ups. Only the other day, Britions were reminded of another sil'encing wea_pon the government possesses -the system known as the D-notice. Under this system, begun in 1912, news\u00ad papers have voluntarily agreed not to pub\u00ad lish\u00b7 ~nformation that officials deem contrary to security. Twice last week, Prime Minis\u00ad ter Wilson attacked the Daily Express for allegedly violating a D-notice in reporting that security agents were still reading tele\u00ad grams sent overseas. -But even if silencing devices were removed, it is doubtful that the public would discover ~e kind of prodigious secret aid practiced by the CIA.. A shrewd observer put in this way: \"Americans think they need hundreds of thousands of dollars to get anywhere-the whole paraphernalia of letterheads, carpeted suites, secretaries, first-class plane tickets. Here a few thousand pounds (a pound is $2.80) is enough. A musty office, a scruffy bright young man and a single mimeograph n)achine is enough.\" \u00b7Moreover, there exist organizations that can provide overt assistance, most notably the British Council. Founded in 1934, this agency gives broad support to overseas cul\u00ad tural programs with state money. Its budget for 1966-67 was $30 million. BRITISH PRATFALLS British intelligence has endured its prat\u00ad falls. There are still bitter memories in the Middle East about a \"black\" radio station beamed from Cyprus with covert British help during the Suez crisis. Moreover, there is a lively controversy under way over exaggerated claims some feel were made for British war\u00ad time subversion in France. But here discretion and frugality are the rule. One qualified observer said: \"A persistent problem with CIA oper~tions is that not enough thought is given to what might happen when they are exposed. 'This was true of the Ba.y of Pigs, of the U-2 flight and the large subsidies to student organiza\u00ad tions. In each case, American prestige was vested in debatable risks--Cuban exiles,, a hired pilot and youngsters still in college. \"No doubt these efforts often produce rE;\u00ad sults. But when they backfire, the noi!le can be heard clear around the worict'.\" \u00b7 ' In Britain, it might be said; any backfire is usually muffled in a clubby smoking-room. The MI-6 i~;~ not a government, but for the most J?ar.tit is truly invi.sible. \u00b7 . i. ' --,. ~- ~( 1 IN FRANCE, THEY PAY OPENLY t' (By Waverley Root) PARis.-The French reacti9n to the subsidy given by the CIA to the National Students . Association is: \"It couldn't happen here.\" This is not because French secret services would necessarily be above such tactics; but because somebody else is already taking care of such subsidies-more or less. openly . .' - During the Algerian revolution, ~he Na\u00ad tional Union_of French Students . was openly receiving subsidy from the LFrench gov\u00ad ernment through the MinistrY: of Educ\u00b7ation. When the UNEF <began to\u00b7respouse the cause of Algerian independence, the subsidy was canceled and government support was then .given to a rival student organization, oriented politically to the right. But the government tactics backfired. The new recipient of government largesse also took. up the cudgel for the Algerian cause ~ Today, the UNEF is agaip. the principal stu\u00ad dent o,rganization and once again is enjoy\u00ad ing goverriment support. The past is for\u00ad given. A ?tormal action This is the difference between French ana American uses of the subsidy. In France, helping your political supporters is consid\u00ad ered a normal action which need not be car\u00ad ried on in secret. Undercover activities in connection with organizations receiving subsidies would occur either through bona fide members who would consent to inform secret services, or by se\u00ad cret services planting members in any organi\u00ad zation they wanted to watch. But there is not as much open government subsidizing of organizations as \u00b7 there used to be in France. Before the war, the Ministry of the In\u00ad terior had a secret account for subl)idizing publications. The original idea was to re\u00ad ward newspapers which gave the government a break-but getting a share of the gravy came to be regarded as a right. Secrecy distrusted Such subsidies no longer exist, In addi\u00ad tion, if the French spread any money about abroad, they do it through overt channels. Their secret organizations don't get it to spend. Tlie French have had a good deai of experience with them, and don't trust them with any more power than neces.sary. France's closest parallel to the CIA is the counterespionage organization which came under fire in the Ben Barka kidnaping-the SDECE. The light the Ben Barka case turned on the SDECE revealed certain details of its modus operandi including secret agents at airports to watch the comings and goings of people in whom it was interested and bugging public rooms. But this was not much of a surprise to the French, for whom the tap\u00ad ping of telephones has long been common\u00ad place. \u00b7The trial resulting from the kidnaping of Ben Barka, the Moroccan opposition leader, has not been completed-so it is not known whether the SDECE as a whole was involved in the. case or only one of its agents, but the case reminded the French of the need to keep watch over their watchdogs. \"You Americans make the mistake of leav\u00ad ing the heads_ of your secret organizations in their jobs too long,\" I was once told by a highly placed French politician who had held such a job. L.B.J., A GREAT PRESIDENT WITH A GREA 'r MESSAGE ON HEALTH AND EDUCATION _Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, the President of the United States has just sent to this body his message on educa\u00ad tion and health in America .. This is \u00b7a message that. should make every-Member of the Congress proud. \u00b7 .. Mr: President, with all the brickbats many of us aim at the White House, it seems to me time that we take off our hats and salute President Johnson as the President who has done more for the health and m,ore for the education of Americans than any President in the history of this country. _ After all, what is more important than education and health for our country's strength, our country's future, and the happiness of 200 million Americans? Mr. President, this is not a matter of rhetoric or partisanship. This is a mat\u00ad ter of fact. Within the past 2 .years this Congress, led by President Johnson has $ione more for the health of Americans than ever before\u00b7 in history. . In the past 2 years Congress has pro\u00ad vided a greater impetus to education than ali other Congresses combined in the-history of this Nation. \u00b7_ A gr~at President has sent the Con\u00ad gress a great me~age today charting an even better future. :I say this as one who has consistently fought fpr a reduc\u00ad tion in spending and who will continue to do so. But .in the Nation's health and the Nation's education, parsimonious penny\u00ad pinching would bfl ,very foolish. It would mean the Nation was failing to make the sound investment in its future which will bring returns many times over. I honor the President for asking for additional funds in these areas. \u00b7 Every dollar we invest in additional training opportunities will come back in full in a very f~w years in welfare costs. It will come back again in higher taxes paid. And most importantly it will come back in a stronger, better, . freer, happier America. TRIBUTE TO HENRY ~\u00b7 LUCE\u00b7. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, it is my sad duty to call to the attention of the Senate the death, earlier this morning, of Henry R. Luce, the former editor in chi~f of Time magazine, and well known throughout the world as the head of the Time-Life-Fortune publishing -empire. Mr. Luce, as is well known, was born in China of American missionary par\u00ad ents. He was a graduate of Yale Uni\u00ad versity and -was very prominent in its activities. In 1923, he founded, with Briton Hadden, the Time magazine; in 1930, he founded Fortune magazine; and in 1936, he founded Life magazine. To\u00ad getl}er, they represent probably the single most important publishing force that we know. He was very active, as everyone 4672 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 knows, in the United China Relief which he organized in 1940. He was a stalwart advocate of freedom of the press, and was well known as having initiated the Committee on Freedom of Press in 1944. Mr. President, when a man passes away in the fullness of his years, in the vigor of his talents, we always seek to praise him. Harry, as he was known to his friends--and I have the honor to num\u00ad ber myself among them-and to his as\u00ad sociates in his great publishing empire, made history. He and his associates inaugurated a new epoch of journalism especially for the complete man; we might use the ex\u00ad pression, \"the compleat man.\" He was ahead of his time when he began and time has hardly begun to catch up with him now that he is gone. To those who had the privilege of knowing him, his dominant characteristic was liveliness, and our memory of him, and that of the world, will be the brighter for it. I know of no more beautiful epitaph for a vigorous man, who died in the full\u00ad ness of his activities, than a comment from one of his associates, who told me a few minutes ago: Harry would have wanted to die this way\u00ad when he went he was barreling along with a full head of steam on the many problems which absorbed his heart and mind. Henry R. Luce lived a life of excite\u00ad ment. He and his associates inaugurated a new approach to journalism: the sum\u00ad mation of news after research in depth, and placing it in context by showing its relationship to other news. His aim was the compleat man in information, cul\u00ad ture, education, sports, finance, and liv\u00ad ing. He made one of the truly historic contributions in communications, and to this ideal he devoted his life. I know my colleagues will wish to join me in expressing our deepest sym\u00ad pathy and condolences to Clare Booth Luce, a personal friend of mine, who served the State of Connecticut in the other body. She is a very gifted, and a very exciting woman herself, for whom this is a very sad hour. We can only hope that the expressions of friendship and sympathy which will be heard on the :floor of the Senate to\u00ad day will be of some comfort to her in her sad bereavement. Mr. MANSFIELD and Mr. DODD ad\u00ad dressed the Chair. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I yield first to the distinguished majority leader, and then I shall yield to the Senator from Connecticut. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I wish to join the distinguished senior Sen\u00ad ator from New York [Mr. JAVITSJ and the distinguished senior Senator from Con\u00ad necticut [Mr. Donn] to express regret at the passing of Henry Luce. He founded Time in the twenties, during a most difficult period; he set a new stand\u00ad ard for a news magazine which has since been emulated very often. Henry Luce was a man of controversy and' one could always take issue with some of the articles published under his direction. I believe that that was a part of the attraction which Time held for so many people. This man was born in China of missionary parents and his life reflected his great interest in that part of the world. He has made a contribu\u00ad tion which cannot be fully measured by those of us who are here today. Per\u00ad haps his greater contribution will come when his magazine, Time, will be looked back upon as a document which can be considered as the source of material for historic research. To me his passing was totally unex\u00ad pected. He will be missed, his contribu\u00ad tion to journalism will be missed but that contribution will also serve as a monu\u00ad ment in history. Mr. JAVITS. I am grateful to the majority leader for his comments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. JA VITS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 5 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. J A VITS. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut. Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. I wish to join him and the majority leader in paying tribute to Henry R. Luce. Mr. Luce and his wife were for many years residents of the State of Connecti\u00ad cut. Mrs. Luce represented her district in the House of Representatives with great ability and grace, and she made a great contribution in her time in the House of Representatives for the better\u00ad ment of the country. I have been privileged to know Henry Luce for 22 years. I considered him one of the outstanding journalists of this country, a great publisher and, more than that, a truly great American citizen. I believe that his contribution in the field of journalism will be a monument to the improvement of factual reporting in this country for many, many generations to come. I believe, Mr. President, that the coun\u00ad try has suffered a great loss. I did not know that he was seriously ill. It will be a personal loss to a vast number of people who enjoyed the warmth of his friendship, and who also enjoyed his publications. I join my colleagues in extending sym\u00ad pathy to Mrs. Luce and his relatives on this sad occasion. Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I join the Senator from New York and the Senator from Connecticut in tribute to the late Henry Robinson Luce. Mr. Luce was a controversial man with whom, I suppose, at one time or another, everyone in the Senate disagreed and disagreed violently. But, at the same time, he was a man who made a great contribution to American journalism, in that at the age of 23, fresh out of Yale University, he founded Time magazine. As the Senator from New York has pointed out, \u00b7 he founded many other publications, but Time magazine held the Nation's attention with its provoca\u00ad tive, readable, exciting style and format, which made everyone sit up and pay at\u00ad tention to current events in a way which had not been done before. Since then, Time magazine has had some imitators, but I am sure that one reason why Americans ' are as well informed today as they are is due to the formula of Luce and Hadden. The smashing success that Time maga\u00ad zine has achieved, of course, brought Mr. Luce great wealth and power; but far more important, he made a vast contri\u00ad bution to public understanding and pub\u00ad lic literacy, enabling the American peo\u00ad ple to follow what was going on in the world in an intelligent manner. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin very much for his remarks. Mr. President, I should like to reserve an opportunity for other Senators to have a similar opportunity to speak on Mr. Luce, and I therefore ask unanimous consent that such statements may be included in the REcoRD as a part of these remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to Henry Luce. I did not have the opportunity of knowing him as well as the Senator from New York or the Senator from Wisconsin but I did have the opportunity to meet him on severat occasions and I found him to be a delightful and talented man. Having read Time magazine from week to week, I know, too, that his presence will be sorely missed in the field of journalism. I extend to Mrs. Luce my heartfelt sympathy at this sorrowful moment in her life. EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, I proudly and enthusiastically support the President's message on education which keeps us on the successful course begun by the 89th Congress. I applaud that part of the message that calls for an in\u00ad crease in Federal funds for constructing new educational television facilities in this country and for the establishment now of a Public Television Corporation. I am hopeful that when this legislation is introduced it will be referred to the Sen\u00ad ate Commerce Committee and assigned to my Subcommittee on Communica\u00ad tions with my assurance to the Congress and to the administration that hearings will proceed with all possible expedition. Television, over the past decade, has become an integral part of quality edu\u00ad cation, and far from detracting from in\u00ad dividual attention provided to the stu\u00ad dent in the classroom, it has enhanced personal attention by freeing teachers from formal lecturing for more individ\u00ad ual tutoring assignments. Also it has enhanced classroom visual arts instruc\u00ad tion-so necessary to help students thor\u00ad oughly understand difficult and complex subjects. Educational TV also permits even the smallest college to have access to some of the great scholars in the world. Yet no one is contending that educa\u00ad tional television has fully lived up to its promises or expectations. It will never, for example, replace the most vital ele\u00ad ment in the classroom: the skills and talents of the individual teacher. Nor is it intended to do so. Rather, educational television and the support by the Federal Government of numerous ETV stations across the country have acted significantly to supplement educa\u00ad tional needs. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4673 I agree with the President's proposal that a thorough study must be made of the feasibility of satellite communica\u00ad tions in building an educational network to encourage the widest and the most effective use of educational broadcasting facilities and to study the impact of edu\u00ad cational TV and its relationship to in- structional TV. . As recently as August of 1966 during my subcommittee's hearings on the so\u00ad called Ford Foundation proposal, I made it abundantly clear and I reiterate now that satellite communications will play a vital role from a national standpoint in the development of a nationwide educa\u00ad tional television system and how this is to be done requires a national policy which should be developed wi\u00b7th care and I am happy to see that the President is cognizant of this and has called upon the executive, the Congress, and private sec\u00ad tors to cooperate together in developing this national policy. Again I applaud the message of the President on education in all of its aspects. LEAGUE OF NATIONS FAILURE ON HUMAN RIGHTS SHOWS WHY U.N. MUST NOT FAIL HUMAN RIGHTS Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, sin- cere persons have asked, \"Why is it neces\u00ad sary for the community of nations to outlaw genocide? Surely it is obvious that civilized man will not condone such a monstrously heinous crime.\" We can all hope that the civilized world will not condone another act of genocide, but\u00b7 barbaric genocide has been per\u00ad petrated within the lifetime of most of us. Who among us can deny that the League of Nations' impotence in protect\u00ad ing German citizens from their own gov\u00ad ernment contributed significantly to the impunity with which the Third Reich waged its subsequent campaigns of do\u00ad mestic persecution and foreign aggres\u00ad sion? How could these uncivilized acts of terror against\u00b7 German citizens have been allowed? Simply because the Third Reich asserted its absolute sov\u00ad ereignty over its citizens and denied the League of Nations any right of inspec\u00ad tion. The League's failure to enact meaning\u00ad ful international agreements on protect\u00ad ing human rights enabled any govern\u00ad ment so disposed to organize and execute a program of terror against its own people. In 1939 when anouncing his intention to destroy the Polish race, the diabolically canny Hitler recognized both the failure of civilized nations to intervene and the willingness of civilized nations to forget past atrocities when he asked: \"Who still talks nowadays of the extermination of the Armenians?\" Well, I am sure that the American peo\u00ad ple do remember the Armenians, do re\u00ad member the Jews, do remember the Poles, the Slavs, the Hungarians, and the Rumanians who have faced the execu\u00ad tioner-not because of any criminal charge, but simply because they were born Armenians, Poles, Jews, or Slavs. Every American certainly can recall vividly that 291,557 American me? and CXIII--296-Part 4 boys made the ultimate sacrifice in World War II to stop Hitlerism. The United Nations has not made the same mistake which the League did. The United Nations has proposed and enacted universal covenants on human rights. The Convention on Genocide, unani\u00ad mously adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, was signed by the United States in 1949. Tragically mindful of past in\u00ad action, civilized man wanted to be sure that the world would never again be af\u00ad flicted with genocide. But has the Senate forgotten? The United States has historically been a be\u00ad hemoth in battle: Will the Senate continue to restrict the United States to being a dwarf in pursuit of international human rights? The Senate should shake off its lethargy of indifference and move with all dispatch toward recognizing the uni\u00ad versality of human rights-by immedi\u00ad ately ratifying the Convention on Geno- ct~. . MILWAUKEE JOURNAL CITES ATOMIC MILESTONE Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I invite the attention of my colleagues to an editorial published in the Milwaukee Journal, Sunday, February 19. It ob\u00ad serves that last year, for the first time since it was founded 20 years ago, the Atomic Energy Commission's spending for peaceful projects matched that' for weapons. I think it now can be said that, 22 years after the first atomic blast at Alamogordo, N. Mex., the dream that this immense energy could be harnessed for the enrichment of mankind is bear\u00ad ing significant fruit. All mankind hopes that atomic power will never again be used for war, but that, instead, there will be ever-expand\u00ad ing uses for this energy in peaceful projects that will mean a better and richer life for all men everywhere. It is in this 22d year of the atomic age that the United States and Russia-the two outstanding nuclear powers-are discussing a treaty on nuclear arms con\u00ad trol. We should give our leaders every encouragement so that 1967 may signal the coming of age of atomic power. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the REcORD the article to which I have referred. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE BENEFICIAL ATOM President Truman called it \"the most im\u00ad portant branch of government to be created in 100 years.\" He was referring to the atomic energy commission, which 20 years ago took over the nation's atomic energy program. The commission has presided over the orderly transfer of control of atomic energy from military to civ111an hands and the development of peaceful uses for nuclear energy. When the commission was created the de\u00ad structive potential of the atom was fresh in memory, but the constructive potential was less clear. During the AEC's early years military goals continued to occupy most of the new agency's energies. America's early lead in weapons production has not been overcome by a_ny other naltion. An historic shift was signaled in 1953 when President Eisenhower proposed . an \"atoms for peace\" program in a speech be\u00ad fore the United Nwtions. A law passed the following year cleared the way !or the paci\u00ad fication and internationallzwtion of atomic energy. Secrecy was lifted, permitting dis\u00ad tribution to the world's scientists of much of America's nuclear knowledge. The AEC's monopoly on atomic reactors was ended. Agreements were signed with other nations for the exchange of information on peaceful uses of the atom. The AEC encouraged private electric com\u00ad panies to invest in nuclear generating plants. The agency's prototype reactor at Shipping\u00ad port, Pa., began producing electricity in 1957. Within six years, 16 more electric power re\u00ad actors were operating or under construction. Last year, utilities announced plans for a record 27 new generating plants. The AEC estimates that p.uclear reactors will s1,1pply 25% of the nation's electricity by 1980 and half by 2000. \u00b7 Materials and devices developed as a result of nuclear experimentation have found scores of peaceful applications in medicine and industry. Other applications are under development, including processes to remove f'!alt from sea water and to preserve foods. Some projects have been given up for the time as impractical-the nuclear airplane, for example. Now atomic scientists are plan\u00ad ning nuclear powered rockets to carry man to the moon and beyond. A significant milestone was reached last year when, for the first time, AEO spending for peaceful projects matched that for weap-. ons. If the United States and Russia could agree on a nuclear arms control treaty now under discussi\u00b7on, both would be able to turn vastly greater resources to harnessing atomic \u00b7 energy for the. benefit of man. ~ .. DR. WOODLIEF THOMAS Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, Dr. Woodlief Thomas is one of the handful of those who received a Ph. D. from the old Brookings Graduate School. Robert Brookings founded the institution which has, of course, long since ceased to grant graduate degrees with the ideal of im\u00ad proving the quality of personnel charged with research, analysis, and policymak\u00ad ing in the Government. I am sure that if Mr. Brookings were alive today\u00b7 he would have had many occasions to fMl proud not only of the institution which he began, but of the professional output and influence which its graduates and fellows have had-and probably in no case would this be more so than that of Woody Thomas. It is rather hard for us today to realize that somebody, sometime in the past, working against frustrations, had to con\u00ad ceive, nurture, and refine such a thing as the industrial production index, which we take for granted. No matter how critical some of us are at times of the Federal Reserve System and its policies, we all appreciate the privilege it has been to have known and had the opportunity to be advised by one who was a part of the Federal Reserve thinking in its early days as it felt its way through the 1920's and 1930's from a passive attitude to a more active attitude toward the money market. We are certainly still learning by the month and by the year about the uses and misuses of monetary policy as a stabilization tool. How much more must one have learned who has had such an 4674 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 intimate part in the evolution of our cen\u00ad tral bank for 40 or 50 years through the time when it was evolving from a system of regional banks through the early stages of a true central bank when open market operations first took the form of coordinated bond purchasing activities. I need not mention the changes that took place in the 1930's, especially the Banking Act of 1935, but I do want to say that we have recognized and greatly benefited by the presence with us of a man who knows how things got the way they are. Since he left active work -wi-th the Federal Reserve System, Dr. Thomas has been an adviser to the Government of Chile in establishing their central bank and, more recently, he has been a staff member with the Senate Banking and CUrrency Committee. He is leaving tha.t role as of today and this is the occasion prompting me to these remarks. I will certainly miss the opportunities to consult with Woody and I think .I speak the feelings of all of the other members of the Banking and CUrrency Committee when I say that we deeply appreciate the help and advice he has been giving us and we will greatly miss his presence. Perhaps I should add that we are not going to give him up entirely but if the occasion arises when some need to understand the developing system bet\u00ad ter comes up, I am certainly going to write and ask for his advice and counsel. THE PROPOSED ~D STATES\u00ad SOVIET CONSULAR TREATY Mr. JA VITS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 15 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I intend to introduce what I consider to be a rather important bill. Before I do that, I call the attention of the Senate to the action of a group of Republican Members in the other body who have joined to\u00ad gether to endorse the Consular Treaty, which the Senate will be considering shortly. I ask unanimous consent that the text of their statement and the list of those signing it be printed in the RECORD as a part of my remarks. There being no objection, the state ... ment and list of names were ordered to be printed in t}?.e RE.CORD, as follows: STATEMENT \u00b7ON CONSULAR TREATY \u00b7 The proposed consular treaty and protocol with the Soviet Union is important in the national interest and we strongly urge its ratification. At a critical time in international affairs the ratification of the treaty can serve two clear objectives of U.S. foreign policy. First, it can insure that some 18,000 Amer\u00ad ican tourists wm be afforded basic protec\u00ad tions in the Soviet Union and that our offi\u00ad cers in any consulate would enjoy diplo~atic immunity. This treaty, which provides re\u00ad ciprocal rights, inures significantly to our benefit. Second, while the consular treaty is a modest step, its ratification may encourage greater flexibility in Soviet policy and facili\u00ad tate improved U.S.-Soviet relations. It can serve as a clear demonstration that the world's two most powerful nations are de\u00ad termined to move from a position of mis-trustful polarization toward more positive efforts for the achievement of peace and stability. Rejection of the treaty could have serious implications for U.S.-Soviet relations. Our two governments, together and separately, are exploring a number of vitally important subjects: an honorable settlement of the Vietnamese conflict; a non-proliferation treaty; the expansion of non-strategic East\u00ad West trade; an avoidance of a major new arms race of a much higher order of magni\u00ad tude involving a new generation of ICBM's and ABM systems. Agreement in any of these areas could have a profound impact on the \u00b7stability of international affairs. Rejection of the con\u00ad sular treaty might create a psychological at\u00ad mosphere in which serious negotiations with the Soviet Union on any of these subjects would be infinitely more difficult--if not precluded. Assurances given to the President from the Director of the Federal Bureau of Inves\u00ad tigation that the Bureau could deal effec\u00ad tively and efficiently with any problems which might arise under the treaty would seem to remove any significant reason for opposition to ratification. As Republicans, we take pride in the fact that the treaty is the culmination of an idea first proposed by a Republican Administra\u00ad tion eight years ago. We hope that it w111 have continued Republican support. From the offices of Congressmen: Ogden R. Reid, New York. Alphonzo Bell, California. Daniel E. Button, New York. Silvio 0.

THE CRIME-COMMISSION AND ALCOHOLISM Mr. JAVITS. 'Mr. President, the re\u00ad port of the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, like the recent report on crime in the District of Columbia, reflects the growing national concern with our Na\u00ad tion's fourth largest health problem, alcoholism. Recent court decisions--Easter against District of Columbia, and Driver against Innnant--have estal:rUshed the prin\u00ad ciple that intoxication cases must be handled medically and socially. The Crime Commission report deals with the problem of public and chronic ~lcoholism . on this basis. Other nations in the Western World have long recognized this principle and now, it would appear, the United States is following suit. , The Crime Commission has recom\u00ad mended the establishment of detoxifica\u00ad tion units as part of comprehensive treatment programs, aftercare for al\u00ad coholics and expanded research into al\u00ad coholism, the problems of alcoholics, and methods of treatment. Together with the Senator from Utah [Mr. Moss], I am preparing comprehensive legislation along these lines to be introduced by us and cosponsoring Senators from both parties in the near future. This measure will be the successor to the b1lls we introduced in the last Congress. The chapter of the Crime Commis\u00ad sion's report dealing with alcoholism and drunkenness offenses merits study by every American. I ask unanimous consent that it be included as a part of my remarks. There being no objection, the extract was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: DRUNKENNESS OFFENSES Two million arrests in 1965--one of every three arrests in America-were for the offense of public drunkenness. The great volume of these arrests places an extremely heavy load on the operations of the criminal justice system. It\u00b7burdens police, clogs lower crimi\u00ad nal courts and crowds penal institutions throughout the United States. Because of the sheer size of the problem and because of doubts that have recently been raised about the efficacy of handling drunkenness w1 thin the system of criminal justice, the Commission sought to reexam\u00ad ine present methods of treating drunkenness offenders and to explore promising alterna\u00ad tives. It was not in a position to undertake a comprehensive study of the complex medi\u00ad cal, social, and public health problems of drunkenness. THE EXISTING SYSTEM Drunkenness laws Drunkenness is punishable under a variety of laws, generally describing the offense as being \"drunk in a public place,\" often with\u00ad out providing a precise definition of drunk\u00ad enness itself. Some laws include as a con\u00ad dition that the offender is \"unable to care for his own safety.\" In some jurisdictions there are no laws prohibiting drunkenness, but any drunken\u00ad ness that causes a breach of the peace is punishable. In Georgia and Alabama, for example, drunkenness that is manifested by boisterous or indecent conduct, or loud and profane discourse, is a crime. Other juris\u00ad dictions apply disorderly conduct statutes to those who are drunk in public. In Chicago, for example, the police, having no drunkenness law to enforce, use a disorderly conduct statute to arrest nondisorderly in\u00ad ebriates. Some jurisdictions permit police to make public drunkenness arrests under both State laws and looal ordinances. The laws provide maximum jail sentences ranging from 5 days to 6 months; the most common maximum sentence is 30 days. In some States an offender convicted of \"ha\u00ad bitual drunkenness\" may be punished by a 2-year sentence of imprisonment. The offenders The two million arrests for drunkenness each year involve both sporadic and regular drinkers. Among the number are a wide variety of ,offenders--t.he rowdy college boy; the weekend inebriate; the homeless, often unemployed singie man. How many offend\u00ad ers fall into these and other categories ls not known. Neither is it known how many of the offenders are alcoholics in the medical sense of being dependent on alcohol. There is strong evidence, however, that a large number of those who are arrested have a lengthy history of prior drunkenness arrests, and that a disproportionate number involve poor persons who live in slums. In 1964 in the city of Los Angeles about one-fifth of all persons arrested for drunkenness ac\u00ad counted for two-thirds of the total number of arrests for that offense. Some of the repeaters were arrested as many as 18 times in that year. A review of chronic offender cases reveals that a large number of persons have, in short installments , spent many years of their lives in jail. In 1957 the Committee on Prisons, Probation and Parole in the District of Co\u00ad lumbia studied six chronic offenders and found that they had been arrested for February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4675 drunkenness a total of 1,409 times and had served a total of 125 years in penal institu\u00ad tions. A recent article in a Syracuse, N.Y., newspaper illustrates the point even more succinctly: \"H ____ F ----\u00b7 69, appeared in Police Court for the 277th time on a public intoxication charge. F ----\u00b7 who has served 16 years in the Jamesville Penitentiary in short terms on the charge, was returned there jor a 6- month sentence.\" The great majority of repeaters live on \"skid row\"-a dilapidated area found in most large and medium-size cities in the United States. On skid row substandard hotels and ;roominghouses are intermingled with nu\u00ad merous taverns, pawn shops, cheap cafeterias, employment agencies that specialize in jobs for the unskilled, and religious missions that provide free meals after a service. Many of the residents--including the chronic drunk\u00ad enness offenders--are homeless, penniless, and beset with acute personal problems. The arrest oj the drunkenness offender The police do not arrest everyone who is under the infiuence of alcohol. Sometimes they will help an inebriate home. It is when he appears to have no home or family ties that he is most likely to be arrested and taken to the local jail. One policeman assigned to a skid row precinct in a large eastern city recently de\u00ad scribed how he decided whom to arrest: \"I see a guy who's been hanging around; a guy who's been picked up before or been making trouble. I stop him. Sometimes he can convince me he's got a job today\u00b7or got something to do. He'll show me a slip showing he's supposed to go to the blood bank, or to work. I let him go. But if it seems to me that he's got nothing to do but drink, then I bring him in.\" Drunkenness arrest practices vary from place to place. Some police departme~ts strictly enforce drunkenness statutes, while other departments are known to be more tolerant. In fact, the number of arrests in a city may be related less to the amount of public drunkenness than to police policy. Some of the wide variations in police prac\u00ad tices can be seen in the table below that com\u00ad pares drunkenness arrests by two police de\u00ad partments known to be. guided by policies of . strict enforcement (Atlanta, Ga., and Wash\u00ad ington, D.C.) to arrests by a department that is considered more tolerant (St. Louis, Mo.). In some large and medium-size cities, police departments have \"bum squads\" that cruise skid rows and border areas to appre\u00ad hend inebriates who appear unable to care for their own safety, or who are likely to annoy others. Such wholesale arrests some\u00ad times include homeless people who are not intoxicated. Operation oj the criminal system ajter arrest Following arrest, the d-runk is usually placed in a barren cell called a \"tank,\" where he is detained for at least a few hours. The tanks in some cities can hold as many as 200 people, while others hold only 1 or 2. One report described the conditions found in a tank iri this way: \"Although he may ha!:e been picked up for his own protection, the offender is placed in a cell, which ~ay frequently holQ. as many as 40--50 men where there is no room to sit or lie down, where sanitary fac111ties and ventilation are inadequate and a stench of vomit and urine is prevalent.\" \"The drunken behavior oj some of the in\u00ad mates is an added hazard: It is questionable whether greater safety is achieved for the individual who is arrested for his safe keep\u00ad ing.\" The chronic alcoholic offender generally suffers from a variety of ailments and is often in danger of serious medical compli\u00ad cations, but medical care is rarely provided In the tank; and it is difficult to deteet or U> diagnose serious 1llness since it often re-sembles intoxication. Occasionally, chronic offenders become 111 during pretrial deten\u00ad tion and die without having received ade\u00ad quate medical attention. If the offender can afford bail, he usually obtains release after he sobers up. In many jurisdictions an offender is permitted to for\u00ad felt bail routinely by not appearing in court. Thus, if the arrested person has the few dol\u00ad lars required, he can avoid prosecution; if he has no money, as is usually the case, he must appear in court. Drunkenness offenders are generally brought before a judge the morning after their arrest, sometimes appearing in groups of 15 or 20. Rarely are the normal procedural or due process safeguards applled to these cases. Usually defendants are processed through the court system with haste and either released or sentenced to several days or weeks in jail. In some cities only those offenders who request it are jailed. In others, chronic offenders, who are likely to be alcoholics, are generally sent to jail. When a defendant serves a short sentence, he is fed, sheltered, and given access to available recreational fac111ties. In most in\u00ad stitutions there is such a lack of facUlties and financial resources that it is not possible to do more. Austin MacCormick, a former New York City Commissioner of Corrections, noted recently: \"The appallingly poor quality of most of the county jails in the United States is so well known that it is probably not necessary to discuss this point at any great length. The fact that the majority of all convicted alcoholics go to these institutions, however, makes it imperative that the public, and particularly those thoughtful citizens who are interested in the treatment oj alcoholics, nev-er be allowed to forget that our county jails are a disgrace to the country \u00b7and that they have a destructive rather than a beneficial effect not only on alcoholics who are committed to them but also on those others who are convicted of the most petty offenses.\" Comparison of drunkenness arrests in 3 cities Number of arrests (1965) Percentage of all arrests Population (1965 estimates) Drunkenness arrests Washington, D.c __________ 802,000 44,792 St. Louis, Mo ______________ 699,000 2,445 Atlanta, _______________ 522,000 48,835 After serving a brief sentence, 'the chronic offender is released, more likely than not to return to his former haunts on skid row, with no money, no job and no \u00b7plans. Often he is rearrested within a matter of days or hours. In a memorandum of law submitted in a recent case of a homeless alcoholic, defense counsel noted that his client had been ar\u00ad rested 31 times in a period of 4 months and 6 days. Counsel maintained that \"it is fair to conclude [in view of three commitments during that period of time] that he must have been arrested once out of every two days that he appeared on the public streets of the District of Columbia.\" EVALUATION Of THE EXISTING SYSTEM Effect on the offender The criminal justice system appears in\u00ad effective to deter drunkenness or to meet the problems of the chronic alcoholic offender. What the system usually does accomplish is to remove the drunk from public view, de\u00ad toxify him, and provide him with food, shelter, emergency medical service~ \u00b7and a brief period of forced sobriety. As presently constituted, the system is not in a position to meet his underlying medical and social problems. Effect on the system oj criminal justice Including drunkenness within the system of criminal justice seriously burdens and dis\u00ad torts its operations. Because the police often do not arrest the intoxicated person who has a home, there is in arrest practices an inherent discrimination against the homeless and the poor. Due process safe\u00ad guards are often considered unnecessary or futile. The defendant may not be warned of his rights or permitted to make a tele~ phone call. And although coordination, breath, or blood tests to determine intoxica\u00ad tion are common practice in \"driving-while\u00ad intoxicated\" cases, they are virtually non\u00ad existent in common drunk cases. Yet, with\u00ad out the use of such chemlcal tests, it is often difficult to determine whether the individual is intoxicated or suffering from a serious 111- ness that has symptoms similar to intoxi\u00ad cation. ) I accounted for by- \u00b7, Drunk, Disorderly disorderly, conduct and All arrests Drunk and vagrancy arrests vagrancy arrests arrests 52.5 76.6 The handling of drunkenness cases in court hardly reflects the standards of fair\u00ad ness that are the basis of our system of criminal justice. One major reason is that counsel is rarely present. Drunkenness cases often involve complex factual and medical issues. Cross-examination could be conducted on \"observations\" . of a police such as \"bloodshot\" \"staggering gait,\" \"odor\" of alcohol fendant's breath. The testimony of an ex\u00ad pert medical witness on behalf of the de\u00ad fendant could be elicited . The extent of police time allotted to han\u00ad dling drunkenness offenders varies from city to city and from precinct to precinct. In most cities a great deal of time is spent. The inebriate must be taken into custody, transported to jail, booked, detained, clothed, fed, sheltered, and transported to court. In some jurisdictions, police officers must wait, often for hours, to testify in court. There is a commensurate burden on the urban courts. Notwithstanding the fact that an overwhelming caseload often leads judges to dispose of scores of drunkenness cases in minutes, they represent a significant drain on court time which is needed for felony and serious misdemeanor cases. More subtly, drunkenness cases impair the dignity of the criminal process in lower courts, which are forced to handle defend\u00ad ants so casually and to apply criminal sanc\u00ad tions with so little apparent effect. In correctional systems, too, resources are diverted from serious offenders. After court appearance, some offenders are sent to short\u00ad term penal institutions, many of which are already overcrowded. Correctional author\u00ad ities estimate that one-half the entire mis\u00ad demeanant population is comprised of drunkenness offenders. In one city it was reported that 95 percent of short-term prisoners were drunkenness offenders. LINES FOR ACTION The sheer size of the drunkenness problem in relation to the very limited knowledge about causes and treatment makes it impos\u00ad sible to speak in terms of \"solutions.\" 4676 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 There are, however, some important and promising lines that the Commission be\u00ad lieves should be explored. Treating drunkenness as noncriminal The Commission seriously doubts that drunkenness \u00b7 alone (as distinguished from disorderly conduct) should continue to be treated as a crime. Most of the experts with whom the Commission discussed this mat\u00ad ter, including many in law enforcement, thought that it should not be a crime. The application of disorderly conduct statutes would be sufficient to protect the public against criminal behavior stemming from intoxication. This was the view of the President's Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia, which recommended that the District of Columbia drunkenness law \"be amended to require specific kinds of offensive conduct in addition to drunk\u00ad enness.\" Perhaps the strongest barrier to making such a change is that there presently are no clear alternatives for taking into custody and treating those who are now arrested as drunks. The Commission believes that cur\u00ad rent efforts to find such alternatives to tre.atment within the criminal system should be expanded. For example, if adequate pub\u00ad lic health facilities for detoxification are de\u00ad veloped, civil legislation could be enacted authorizing the police to pick up those drunks who refuse to or are unable to co\u00ad operate--if, indeed, such specific authoriza\u00ad tion is necessary. Such legislation could ex\u00ad pressly sanction a period of detention and allow the individual to be released from a public health facility only when he is sober. The Commission recommends: Drunken\u00ad ness should not in itself be a criminal of\u00ad fense. Disorderly and other criminal con\u00ad duct accompanied by drunkenness should remain punishable as separate crimes. The implementation of this recommendation re\u00ad quires the development of adequate civil de\u00ad toxification procedures. Among those seeking alternatives to proc\u00ad essing drunkenness cases through the criminal system are the Vera Institute of Justice in New York City and the South End Center for Alcoholics and Unattached Per\u00ad sons in Boston. The Vera Institute has re\u00ad cently undertaken a project to explore the feasibility of using personnel other than the police to pick up drunks. Included in the study is an attempt to determine what per\u00ad centage of drunks will come to a treatment fac111ty voluntarily. The Vera program would circumvent the criminal process by establishing a system within a public health framework to care for the immediate and long-range needs of the skid row inebriate. The Boston program, which has received funds from the Office of Economic Oppor\u00ad tunity, provides an alternative to the police\u00ad correctional handling of the homeless alco\u00ad holic. Staff personnel of the Boston South End Center have approached homeless in\u00ad ebriates in skid row and offered them assist\u00ad ance. An official of the program estimates that 80 percent of the people approached in this way responded willingly. 'l'he center screens and evaluates the cases and refers homeless alcoholics to appropriate commu\u00ad nity fac111ties. In the past year it has han\u00ad dled the cases of over 900 homeless alco\u00ad holics. The importance of developing an alterna\u00ad tive to treating drunkenness within the crim\u00ad inal system is underlined by court decisions in two Federal circuits holding that alco\u00ad holics cannot be convicted for drunkenness. Easter v. District of Columbia, 361 F.21 50 (D.C. Cir. 1966); Driver v. Hinnant, 356 F.2d 761 (4th Cir. 1966). Pursuant to the Easter decision, alcoholics are no longer being con\u00ad victed of public drunkenness in Washington, D.C. Detoxification centers An alternate approach to present methods of handling drunkenness offenders after ar\u00ad rest and a prerequisite to taking drunken-ness out of the criminal system is the estab\u00ad lishment of civil detoxification centers. The detoxification center would replace the police station as an initial detention unit for in\u00ad ebriates. Under the authority of civil leg\u00ad islation, the inebriate would be brought to this public health facility by the police and detained there until sober. Thereafter, the decision to continue treatment should be left to the individual. Experience in New York and Boston indicates that some alco\u00ad holics may be willing to accept treatment beyond the initial \"sobering up\" period. The center should include such medical serv\u00ad ices a-s physical examinations, an emergency\u00ad care unit for the treatment of acutely intoxi\u00ad cated persons, and transportation to a hos\u00ad pital, if advanced medical care seems neces\u00ad sary. The Commission recommends: Communi\u00ad ties should establish detoxification units as part of comprehensive treatment programs. The Department of Justice has recently provided funds to establish detoxification centers as demonstration projects in St. Louis and Washington, D.C. The St. Louis center is already in full operation; plans for the Washington center are under way. Both units have sufficient facilities to house for a period of a few days those who are in need of \"drying out.\" They also have \"inpatient programs,\" in which patients are given high protein meals with vitamin and mineral supplements and appropriate medication to alleviate alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Bath and laundry facilities are available, as are basic clothing and limited recreational facilities. Regularly scheduled Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, film showings, work . projects, group therapy, and lectures are part of the program. During their stay patients are counseled by social workers and other staff members. . The police might also bring to such a cen\u00ad ter intoxicated persons charged with a variety of petty offenses apart from drunkenness, with violations of administrative codes, and with such felony offenses Hs driving while intoxicated, assault, and larceny. If the po\u00ad lice planned to prosecute the case, a sum\u00ad mons could be left with the offender to ap\u00ad pear in court at a later date. If an intoxi\u00ad cated defendant was charged with commit\u00ad ting a felony, the police could make an in\u00ad dividual determination as to the most ap\u00ad propriate detention facility. If he seemed likely to appear in court he might be taken to the detoxification fac111ty. Otherwise, he would presumably be taken to the local jail, unless there were adequate detention facil\u00ad ities on the premises of the detoxification center. Aftercare programs There is little reason to believe that the chronic offender will change a life pattern of drinking after a few days of sobriety and care at a public health unit. The detoxifica\u00ad tion unit should therefore be supplemented by a network of coordinated \"aftercare\" fa\u00ad c111ties. Such a program might well begin with the mobilization of existing community resources. Alcoholics Anonymous programs, locally based missions, hospitals, mental health agencies, outpatient centers, employ\u00ad ment counseling, and other social service programs should be coordinated and used by the staff of the detoxification center for re\u00ad ferral purposes. It is well recognized among authorities that homeless alcoholics cannot be treated without supportive residential housing, which can be used as a base from which to reintegrate them into society. Therefore, the network of aftercare facilities should be expanded to include halfway houses, community shelters, and other forms of public housing. The Commission recommends: Communi\u00ad ties should coordinate and extend aftercare resources, including supportive residential housing. The success of aftercare fac111ties Will depend upbn the ab1llty of the detoxification unit to diagnose problems adequately and to make appropriate referrals. A diagnostic unit attached to, or used by, the detoxifica\u00ad tion unit could formulate treatment plans by conducting a thorough medical and social evaluation of every patient. Diagnostic work should include assistance to the patient and his family in obtaining counsel\u00ad ing for economic, marital, or employment problems. Subsequent referrals to appro\u00ad priate agencies will be crucial to the success of the overall treatment plan. The diag\u00ad nostic unit, through referral to a job and housing service, might also assist the patient in moving out of the deteriorating environ\u00ad ment of skid row. Philadelphia has already established a diagnostic and relocation center, which offers diagnostic, recreational, therapeutic, vocational counseling, and housing relocation services, including train\u00ad ing in social and occupational skills. Research With over five million alcoholics in the country, alcoholism is the Nation's fourth largest health problem. Research aimed at developing new methods and facilities for treating alcoholics should be given the prior\u00ad ity called for by the scope of the need. The Commission recommends: Research by private and governmental agencies into alcoholism, the probl~ms of alcoholics, and methods of treatment, should be expanded. The application of funds for research pur\u00ad poses appears to be an appropriate supple\u00ad ment to the proposed detoxification and treatment units. Consideration should be given to providing further legislation on the Federal level for the promotion of the neces\u00ad sary coordinated treatment program. Only through such l:\\-joint commitment will the burdens of the present system, which fall on both the cr~minal system and the drunk\u00ad enness offender, be alleviated. THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, on Tuesday, February 21, 1967, it was my privilege to speak before the World Affairs Council of Northern California, at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. I ask unanimous consent that a par\u00ad tial text of my comments, entitled \"The United States and Latin America,\" be printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the state\u00ad ment was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA (Partial text of remarks by U.S. Senator THoMAs H. KucHEL, before World Affairs Council of Northern California, San Fran\u00ad cisco, Calif., Feb. 21, 1967) From George Washington's injunction in his Farewell Address, about steering clear of entangling alliances, until now, America's relations with her neighbors in the Western Hemisphere have been on a different basis than our ties with the rest of the world. Our direct participation in the affairs of Latin America dates back to the 1820's, when the great Simon Bolivar pushed the idea of a conference of independent American countries to be held in Panama in 1826. Mexico and Colombia invited the United States to attend, and the matter was sub\u00ad jected to vigorous and heated Congressional debate which lasted for four months. The invitation was finally accepted, but our participation in the affairs of the conference left much to be desired. One of our dele\u00ad gates died en route to Panama, while the other started his trip so belatedly that he subsequently gave up the idea of attending at all. In the ensuing years, we did participate actively in inter-American conferences, and, as the Twentieth Century neared, began to take initiative in strengthening diplomatic February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4677 and economic ties among the nations in this Hemisphere. In 1889, the first Pan American Conference met in Washington, all independ\u00ad ent nations attended, and, in addition to problems of trade and commerce, attention was also turned to common legal and polit\u00ad ical questions. Thus, while isolation continued to be our basic doctrine, we had begun to show a neighbor's interest in those who lived near us. The First World War brought a change, bringing us, almost against our will, into the drama of the globe. In the 1930's Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"Good Neighbor\" policy was in\u00ad augurated. As the gathering clouds of the Second World War began to take shape, hemispheric ties came to assume a far greater importance than ever before. When that conflict erupted in Europe, the nations of this Hemisphere saw an increas\u00ad ing need for mutual security. Agreements were reached on an early course of action if any American nation were attacked. Most Latin American countries saw the threat to freedom as we did and joined in the fight against the Nazis. This experience and its aftermath brought a new spirit of unity to our Hemisphere. By the Rio Treaty of 1947, the republics of Latin America and the United States agreed on the principle of a collective defense \"in accordance with the principle of continental solidarity.\" In 1948, the Organization of American States was established as a cap\u00ad stone of decades of effort to create a perma\u00ad nent regional agency to work continually toward our common goals. Today, isolation-going it alone-is at last gone, except in the minds of a few who wish the calendar would turn back to the 1800's. It won't come back because it can't, and they ought to know it. In this ever-shrinking world neighborhood where we live, the suc\u00ad cesses and the failures of neighbors are all of the utmost import to the people of the United States. A decent respect for our brethren suggests it. Self-preservation re\u00ad quires it. Thus, today we play a fuller role in the problems of this Hemisphere, and of the world. What is it we have in common With our neighbors to the South? The fact that we live on the same piece of God's earth gives American nations somewhat the same view of the rest of the world, no matter how different the interpretations. A few milllon of our fellow citizens trace their ancestry to lands south of the border. Particularly in the West, we observe a Wide Latin American contribution to art, music, food and language-a contribution to an all\u00ad American culture which merits our pride. The ringing phrases written into our Declaration of Independence, the guarantees of liberty in our Constitution, have been re\u00ad echoed by free men south of us. In the corridors of our common history, Washington and Lincoln walk hand in hand with Bolivar, San Martin, and Benito Juarez. Our all-American goal was simply stated by the late President Kennedy in Mexico City: \"We are dedicated to the ideal of a peace\u00ad ful and free hemisphere, of free and equal nations. 'Democracy,' said Benito Juarez, 'is the destiny of humanity; freedom its inde\u00ad structible arm.' \" The achievement of these goals has be\u00ad come a bipartisan effort in the United States, and is a matter equally beyond dispute in the rest of the Hemisphere from Canada to Chile. In the days following the Second World War, Communism began to probe for weak spots. While America was busily engaged in binding up the wounds in Europe and Asia, Communism sought to penetrate the Americas, and to divide and destroy the solidarity which had been achieved after so many decades. Dwight Eisenhower clearly saw the danger and the responsibility . In the idea of equal\u00ad ity of opportunity through democratic social change, he saw the means of making the Hemisphere proof against the Marxist threat. This concept led to the creation of the Inter-American Development Bank in 1959 and the Act of Bogota of 1960. His aims were: \"1. To help Latin America develop insti\u00ad tutional and human resources. \"2. To strengthen the framework of free\u00ad dom and \"3. To gain a better life for those who are underprivileged, underemployed and under\u00ad educated.\" Prior to the signing of the Bogota Agree\u00ad ment for economic cooperation, the Eisen\u00ad hower Administration sought and received Congressional approval of a contribution of $600,000,000 toward the achievement of these goals. The outgrowth of the 1960 action was the formulation in 1961 by the new President John F. Kennedy of the Alliance for Progress which was incorporated in the Charter of Punta del Este. Partisan politics were not dominant in the Pan American decision of either Eisenhower or Kennedy. They stlll have no place in the administration of the Alliance. We all look hopefully at these programs, and, indeed, there has been some achieve\u00ad ment. In general, the nations of Latin America have begun to make economic prog\u00ad ress in the past five years. A limited growth per capita income has been achieved. Capi\u00ad tal flows have improved. Steps, although small, have been made toward economic in\u00ad tegration. Doctors have found health stand\u00ad ards on the rise. In all this, the role of the United States has been substantial. Total U.S. assistance to the Alliance for 1966 exceeded one billion dollars. Only about one-third of our aid is in grant form. By far the greater portion is in repayable loans, which over the years will result in a net gain for the U.S. Balance of Payments. Private investment, too, has continued to grow. For 1966 the Department of Com\u00ad merce reports a substantial rise in American capital investment in Latin America, well above the record rate of $171,000,000, reached in the previous year. But the rate of growth in most of Latin America has been plagued by rising popula\u00ad tion and insu1Hcient fOOd output. In 1966, total agricultural production declined below levels achieved in 1965. Latin America is to\u00ad day a net importer of food. Over the past ten years agricultural total output increased twenty-seven percent, but per capita output has declined. The population of Latin America Will reach 600,000,000 people by the end of this century at present rates of growth. At the present rates, the population Will double every 26 years. In Brazil, with a population of 85,- 000,000, it will double in about 22 years. The updraft in population is matched by a shift in rural population to the cities re\u00ad sulting in critical shortages in housing, and other vital facilities. In Latin America 45 million people live in urban slums. They live without water or sewage in impossibly over\u00ad crowded conditions. Three to four persons live together in one room. The situation is little better for ali equal number of poople living in rural areas. Meanwhile, there is an alarming emigration of the scientists, engineers, physicians and other trained people who are vitally needed for economic development. The fiow of doc\u00ad tors from Latin America to the United States over the past ten years was equal to the pro\u00ad duction of about four of our medical schools. Over the past five years the cost to Latin America of the emigration of university\u00ad educated people to the United States has been estimated at nearly $80,000,000. Professor John Paddock of Stanford has written an account of the disappearance of the \"Cloud People of Mount Alban\", the ancient people of the Valley of Oaxaca in Southern Mexico, whose civilization came to a sudden end about 900 A.D. He gives as the probable cause for the failure of this once glorious culture the inability of the society to deal successfully with the losing race be\u00ad tween population and food supplies. Despite the grandeur of their culture, the Cloud Peo\u00ad ple could not survive unless they solved this fundamental problem. In the collapse at Oaxaca, their nation all but disappeared. Like each of you, I have a profound respect for those great, mystical Indian civilizations of distant antiquity in the Americas whose progress and whose struggles relate a remark\u00ad able story by any human standard. We are only now beginning to understand the sig\u00ad nificance of these ancient cultures. It is against this proud background of accom\u00ad plishment that we see a virtual renaissance in modern Mexico. The Mexican Republic-with its moment\u00ad ous revolution against tyranny and its suc\u00ad cessful fight for liberty and independence\u00ad has marked many milestones of progress. There is much that all America can learn from the Mexican achievement of self-sus\u00ad taining growth. The National Product over the past fifteen years has grown at rates far surpassing the goals of Punta del Este. Its agriculture is in surplus. I was particularly pleased when President Diaz Ordaz last September set a national ob\u00ad jective to insure that two-thirds of all in\u00ad vestment come from the private sector. The Republic of Mexico has begun her own pro\u00ad gram of aid to Central America, including 6 million dollars to the Central American Bank for Economic Integration. She has also signed technical assistance agreements with Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Mex\u00ad ico has become a leading contributor to the achievement of the goals of which our great democratic leaders have dreamed. We are all looking with hope to the up\u00ad coming Summit Conference of Latin Amer\u00ad ican heads of state to provide new de\u00ad partures in our search for their goals. Next April's meeting will require a thorough and objective appraisal of all of the issues of the Hemisphere. Vexing problems remain unsolved between the United States and a number of our Latin American neighbors. I regret exceedingly that jurisdiction over the open oceans 200 miles seaward of their borders has been claimed by some of our neighbors. No nation should be allowed to harm the vital interests of her neighbors, but I regret to say that in at least one instance, we have in our Hemisphere a very real problem in\u00ad volving the vital interests of all American states. The traditional, historic concept of freedom of the seas has been summarily abrogated by some of our southern neigh\u00ad bors who are asserting a seaward jurisdiction . as much as 200 miles from their coast line. That is hardly a good neighbor policy on their part. Such claims are unreasonable and arbitrary. The skirmishes which have occurred because of those claims have be\u00ad more more frequent and are :rruiking a bad situation infinitely worse. In 1965 I suc\u00ad ceeded in amending the Foreign Aasistance Act to provide that aid can be Withdrawn from nations that interfere with American fishing vessels on what, by any reasonable determination, should be called the high seas. I continue to believe, however, that the good people in the countries involved should-no, must-come into an agreement on a rea\u00ad sonable basis, as has been the case in the set\u00ad tlement of other inter-American disputes in recent years. I have sponsored legislation designed to achieve a reasonable settlement \u00b7 on a basis other than our simply refusing to ally ourselves with the progress of the countries involved. We come then to the agenda. What is to be done to improve our Hemispheric neigh\u00ad borhood? 4678 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 If La tin America is to use its resources for progress, it should be freed of the bur\u00ad den of excessive armament costs. The pro\u00ad posed creation of a Latin American Nuclear Free Zone made up of the nations south of the United States should permit our neigh\u00ad bors to continue their progress without pay\u00ad ing the astronomical costs of competing in a nuclear arms race. A Nuclear Free Zone will have its problems. Cuba will not par\u00ad ticipate. But the unanimity-minus-one of states who will join this cause leaves no doubt that the overwhelming interest of the peoples of the Hemisphere is to seek peace with justice in the nuclear age. The might of the United States must stand ready now, as always, to defend the Americas against nuclear attack. This position is im\u00ad plicit in the solidarity agreements of the Rio Treaty. It should be made clear by a further strengthening of Charters of the Organiza\u00ad tion of American States. No nation should have any doubt about the readiness of the United States to resist aggression and sub\u00ad version in the Hemisphere, in whatever form or time. In my opinion, the consultative arrange\u00ad ments of the OAS should be amended to take account of the need for rapid response to any nuclear attack on this Hemisphere. There is little to be gained by consulting after the fact of any nuclear exchange. Rather, in the first instance, let the nations of the world be on notice. The Americas wm be resolutely defended. . There are those who might cynically view this as traditional imperialism. Let them be assured the direct opposite is the case. Citizens of the United States, like all decent people everywhere, are peace loving, and as a matter of mutual interest are wi111ng to come to the aid of their neighbors who want to live as they do. This is an interdependent world; all reasonable men recognize that fact. The larger issue, however, rests with the question of social and economic development, particularly of organizing the resources of the Americas for progress exceeding the rate of population growth. In the past 5 years there has been an em\u00ad phasis on economic integration through the Latin American Free Trade Association, the Central American Common Market, the In\u00ad ter-American Bank, and the Alliance itself. The United States must look with favor on the formation of a Common Market in the South. Our southern neighbors do not now seek United States membership, for many reasons, which I believe are valid. Our membership in a Common Market would distort the efH\u00ad cient flow of goods among the developing nations, whose economic units must come to reinforce each other and eliminate point\u00ad less competition. The United States can continue to help capital resources, especially from the private sector, and to assist, where. we can, in the expansion of markets. The success of international banking insti\u00ad tutions, such as the Inter-American Bank, its new counterpart, the Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank, itself, suggests that the use of multilateral assistance should be broadened, as a means of mobilizing capi\u00ad tal. I think this kind of repayable, interest\u00ad bearing bank loan is particularly important in La tin America where direct aid from the United States has in the past taken on politi\u00ad cal overtones, unrelated to the objectives of ra tiona! economic progress. In my view, our program of aid ought to be essentially one of repayable loans. The banking function helps to assure sound business practices and a uni\u00ad form system of procedures in accounts and at law. Bank investment also helps to ex\u00ad pand the scope of the market for free com\u00ad petitive enterprise. Latin American nations must also con\u00ad centrate increasingly on multi-national projects in public works, in power trans\u00ad mission in tele-communications and 1n the exploitation of Latin America's vast river systems. We should also recognize fully the need for a Second Atlantic-Pacific Canal as a means of increasing the fiex1bil1ty of our trade patterns with one another. In all of this, free competitive enterprise should be given an ever larger role. Today United States investment in Latin America employs 1,500,000 persons, it supplies one\u00ad tenth of total production, pays one-fifth of all taxes, and accounts for one-third of all export earnings. The local participation arrangements which Kaiser Industries have made in Brazil and Argentina are a clear example of the evident interest of American business in the development of Latin America. The Administration would do well to con\u00ad sider agreements to eliminate double tax\u00ad ation on American firms. As a further in\u00ad centive, profits on American investments in Latin America should be given tax credits by our government if they are re-invested in a reasonable period of time. In this development effort much greater emphasis must be placed on education of all kinds. The people of Latin America must come to realize ,the dangers of their rapid population growth. The experience in India has suggested that as people move from the farm into town, it is easier to explain to them the possib111ties of family planning. The development of urban educational cen\u00ad ters could play a major role in this vital problem . The \"brain drain,\" which poses a serious threat to the formation of the necessary pool of skills, is a problem that must be dealt with imaginatively. The creation of regional institutions at the graduate level on a re\u00ad gional basis would give an opportunity for intellectual and technical advancement and eliminate much of the appeal of emigration. The need to expand intellectual horizons is critical for those who would advance in technical fields. This need is probably a major cause of the Latin brain drain. Finally, all of us must have a common understanding of our history, both to know each other better and to have a clearer view of the path we are treading together. At present rates of population growth, our Hemisphet:e will be the home of more than a b1llion people, not long after the turn of the century. There will be a lot of people living in our neighborhood. Of all the areas of the world, those closest to us re\u00ad quire the most consideration. Let me emphasize that this Hemisphere should have the number one priority in American policy in our efforts toward the positive achieve\u00ad ment of the peace, security, independence and freedom which we all cherish. This is not merely a case of mutual defense or pre\u00ad serving democracy. The survival of our own way of life depends on what the Americas do with their Hemisphere; so we must heed the cry for action. THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH MESSAGE Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the 3-minute limitation on speeches, I be permitted to continue for 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, the White House message on education and health in America has been received by Congress today. In it. we are told that an appropriation of $8.1 million-a 25-percent increase over this year-has been requested in :fiscal year 1968 to expand research and training programs in occupational health and to strengthen State and local public health programs in this :field. As a member of the Senate Appro\u00ad priations Subcommittee which votes funds for the Departments of Labor, and Health, Education, and Welfare, I have had ample opportunity to watch the in\u00ad terest of the Federal Government in oc\u00ad cupational health programs for the last several years. It is unfortunate that this interest has not been as great as the need. I personally led the campaign to con\u00ad duct a survey by the U.S. Public Health Service on the chest diseases which af\u00ad flict coal miners. This program was be\u00ad gun in 1962 on a small scale and, while it has been continued through the years, it still is not on the same scale as that conducted in other countries. I am told that similar needs exist for the occupational hazards of noise, stress, and tension-to mention just a few. The 1965 special report to the Surgeon General on occupational health said that the :first year cost of mounting a national program would be approxi\u00ad mately $15 million. The request contained in today's mes\u00ad sage is about one-half of that amount. Moreover, I am informed that nearly 40 percent of the $8.1 million to be appro\u00ad priated in fiscal year 1968 is required for administration, with another 33 percent to be allocated for research grants. The remaining funds are not sufficient to delve into new programs for other oc\u00ad cupational hazards. The $15 million recommended in the special report to the Surgeon General included some $5 million to be spent for Federal specialists to work with the in\u00ad dividual States for on-the-site studies of occupational hazards facing men and women at their jobs. The $18.1 million to be appropriated in fiscal year 1968 would apparently eliminate this activity or, to say the least, allow it only on a minor scale. I know from firsthand experience that the problems which face America's work\u00ad ing people take a tremendous toll in human suffering and can be an economic and social burden on the well-being of whole communities. I have seen many of my friends in West Virginia fall ill, have to stop work, and ultimately die because of the work they did. I have seen their families go hungry because the father was too incapacitated to do any kind of work. I have sponsored ap\u00ad propriations for research to find out why soft coal workers develop chest diseases and what can be done to eliminate, con\u00ad trol, and cure these diseases. I have also supported the development of a national center for research on occupational res\u00ad piratory diseases so that the knowledge developed from the research on coal miners' chest diseases can be used to benefit other workers. I also know that workers face health hazards other than chest diseases--that four out of :five workers are unprotected on the job. The problems of a celery picker in Michigan, a garage mechanic in California, a machine shop worker in Pennsylvania, a textile plant employee in North Carolina, just to name a few, are different from those of my West Vir\u00ad ginia miners-but they are problems February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4679 nonetheless, and it should weigh heavily on the conscience of the Nation that so little has been done about them. Research, by itself, is not the answer. If a worker in a chemical plant in New York becomes ill from exposure to toxic fumes, there is no way of assuring that the knowledge of the hazard and the necessary precautionary measures reach the chemical companies in other parts of the country. This is why improved re\u00ad porting of occupational diseases is so important. Twice within the last year the Presi\u00ad dent has expressed his concern about the health of the American working public, and yet the 1967 plans a~d budget pro\u00ad posals for occupational health were not responsive to the President's concern. It was left to my subcommittee on ap\u00ad propriations to add funds to assure that the research on occupational respiratory diseases would move forward at a reason\u00ad able pace. Now, it appears that it will be up to Congress again to appropriate the moneys necessary to enable the Depart\u00ad ment of Health, Education, and Welfare to move forward in this area. I think it is fair to say that the con\u00ad cern of the Federal Government about the health of workers has not matched that of labor and big business, nor that of Congress for that matter. Leadership from the very highest level of govern\u00ad ment is needed to strengthen the na\u00ad tional occupational health effort to hasten the day when every worker can go to his job with the assurance that his health is protected. RECREATION IN WEST VIRGINIA Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, recently the Pittsburgh Press carried an article that merits the widest possible circulation, particularly in the East. Written by Gilbert Love, \"Worth an Ogle\" is a brief but comprehensive description of the wonders of Oglebay Park, a magnificent recreational facility that is attracting visitors from an ever\u00ad lengthening radius to the Wheeling area. I shall ask that the article be placed in the RECORD. My colleagues, partic\u00ad ularly those who drive beyond the Ohio River from the Nation's Capital, ought to take note of it. For that matter, Oglebay Park is less than 6 hours from Wash\u00ad ington by automobile--not an unreason\u00ad able distance for a family looking for the unusual over a long weekend. West Virginia is also ready to take care of those with only a day or two to spare, for no area of the State is without unique and refreshing points of diversion for in\u00ad dividuals and families seeking rest and play. While our parks in the eastern part of the State are becoming more pop\u00ad ular by the year, new facilities are now under construction to offer expanded va\u00ad cation sites for both West Virginians and out-of -State guests. West Virginia's mountains have al\u00ad ways been a mecca for those seeking the solitude of nature unspoiled. Now, as those who reside in metropolitan areas look for new avenues of escape from monotony and tension, the hospitable river valley sections of West Virginia will also increase in popularity. The State's potential as a recreation area is almost without limitation, and there is no ques\u00ad tion but that there will be progressively sharp increases in the number of vaca\u00ad tionists who will come to enjoy West Vir\u00ad ginia's beauty as the Nation's population continues to grow. The capacity of Atlantic seaboard re\u00ad sorts is already being overtaxed. For the city dweller who takes his family to the beach for a weekend, the ride home over congested highways and bridges tends to negate whatever advantages a swim in the ocean may have had. Within 6 weeks or so, as the first indications of spring come to soften winter skies, access to the shore on a Friday night will become in\u00ad creasingly difficult. By mid-June, trav\u00ad elers will ask themselves whether the trip was necessary or desirable. As beach traffic continues to pick up, the mountains of West Virginia will reach out and persuade more and more families to behold the majestic beauty and incomparable tranquillity that God has built into the wide regions of my State. As new facilities are developed and present facilities expanded, West Virginians are also broadening the range of hotels, motels, and dining facilities to assist in providing every service for guests who will visit our State this year and in the future. So, I say to my colleagues and other Americans, come to West Virginia. We have the parks, the revitalizing scenery, and the kind of warm hospitality to con\u00ad vince one and all that life begins not necessarily \"at 40\" but, indeed, it be\u00ad gins when one has spent a weekend or a holiday season in the West Virginia hills. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the article t'J which I have referred be printed at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: WORTH AN OGLE (By Gilbert Love) [This is another article in a series about wandering in a winter wonderland.] 0GLEBAY PARK, W. VA.-The chances seem good that you know this park in summer. It's less than 60 miles !rom Pittsburgh and is one o! the best-equipped in the East, o!\u00ad !erlng golf, swimming, boating, 1lshing, rid\u00ad ing, picnicking, dancing, outdoor theater, nature walks and all sorts o! special events. It doesn't have as long a recreational menu in winter, but it stlll is a llvely place and worth an afternoon's visit or a weekend stay. Unlike most rural parks it has people at this season. Even on week days popular Wil\u00ad son Lodge has many guests. On week ends its guest rooms are likely to be sold out and its big dining room filled with people who have come out !rom Wheeling, or !rom near\u00ad by cities like Pittsburgh and Cleveland, to ski or enjoy other park !ac111ties. The big Mansion Museum is open 9:30 to 5 every week day and 1:30 to 5 on Sundays. It has one o! the nation's best glass collections, rooms done in period furniture and, cur\u00ad rently, a special exhibit titled \"How to Look at a Painting.\" The museum has become so popular that it is able to command an admission price of $1 for adults. Children under 12 are not charged. The Garden Center, including a palm house, specialized gift shop and library, is open Tuesdays through Saturdays and Sun\u00ad day afternoons. The park's greenhouses are open dally, 7:30 to 4. The ski area, with poma lifts and rope tows, operates daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. when there's snow or enough cold weather to make it artificially. When there isn't, there's golf. There's also riding, out o! the park's sta\u00ad bles, over 12 miles of bridle paths. And hiking, o! course. Schenk Lake is heavily stocked with rain\u00ad bow trout, bass and channel catfish and fish\u00ad ing is permitted whenever the lake has no ice cover. No West Virginia license is re\u00ad quired, but persons over 12 are charged $1.50 and everyone pays by the inch !or any fish he catches and wishes to keep. (A trout over 18 inches long would be $4 . . . and worth it) . In winter the park also offers a !ull sched\u00ad ule o! lectures, films and classes. Next Sun\u00ad day afternoon Roger Latham, OUtdoor Edi\u00ad tor o! The Press, will be a winter lecture series speaker. Quite a place, Oglebay. It's a former coun\u00ad try estate, in the West Virginia Panhandle, that was given to the City o! Wheeling and has been intensively developed by its Park Commission. Pittsburghers can drive to it in about an hour by taking U.S. Route 19 south to Wash\u00ad ington, Pa., then Interstate 70 and some re.;. maining sections o! U.S. 40 to an intersec\u00ad tion with State 88 in suburban Wheeling. You can contact Wilson Lodge by mail or phone through Wheeling. DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INTERESTS Mr. CASE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators CLARK, HART, HATFIELD, KUCHEL, and TYDINGS, I intro\u00ad duce a bill to require the public disclosure of the financial interests of Members of Congress and top legislative staff, as well as top officials in the executive branch. Our bill would require Members of Congress-and candidates for Congress\u00ad and top legislative staff, as well as top officials in the executive branch, to make annual reports covering all their income and the sources thereof, gifts received of more than nominal value, liabllities. and assets, and all transactions in com\u00ad modities, real and personal property. These reports would be filed with the Comptroller General and would be freely accessible to the press and public. I am more convinced than ever that such a measure offers the most effective way to protect the integrity of govern\u00ad mental processes, both legislative and ad\u00ad ministrative. So far as the Congress is concerned, the last few years have provided ample demonstration of the futility of expect\u00ad ing Congress to discipline itself. For years the Senate, for example, has squirmed uneasily in the face of recur\u00ad rent \"exposes\" or allegation of miscon\u00ad duct by Members or staff. But we have yet to come to grips with the problem. For example, in 1958, Congress adopted a code of ethics covering all persons in Government service, Congress included. Printed in red, blue, and gold, it is avail\u00ad able to hang on any Member's wall. It does add a decorative note, but I rather doubt that it serves any other purpose, since it consists of pious homilies, unex\u00ad ceptional in themselves but too general in nature to provide real standards, much less any means of enforcement. In any case, only a few years later the Bobby Baker case broke, and we 4680 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 had the on-again-off-again Rules Com\u00ad mittee inquiry. Ineffective though it was, the inquiry could not avoid the conclu\u00ad sion that the former secretary to the majority was \"guilty of many gross im\u00ad proprieties\" and \"used the influence of his public office to feather his own nest and hence acted unethically\"-a state\u00ad ment to which the committee appended the puzzling comment \"even though the subject matter did not touch the 'public' interest.'' . The committee reported several recom\u00ad mendations, including a limited dis\u00ad closure requirement. They were, how\u00ad ever, not acted upon by the Senate since consideration of them terminated ab\u00ad ruptly when the Senate adopted a reso\u00ad lution to establish a new Select Commit\u00ad tee on Standards and Conduct. Understandably, there was no rush to volunteer for service on the select com\u00ad mittee, and it was many months before the committee was organized. Shortly thereafter, it was confronted with allega\u00ad tions involving a colleague, and its in\u00ad quiry into this matter has been proceed\u00ad ing ever since. The inquiry had hardly begun when a Supreme Court decision made clear the unique position in which legislatures find themselves in matters of ethical stand\u00ad ards and conflicts of interest prob\u00ad lems. In a case involving a Member of the House of Representatives, the Court pointed to article I, section 6, of the Con\u00ad stitution, which provides that ''for any speech or debate in either House, they (Senators and Representatives) shall not be questioned in any other place.\" This provision, the Court concluded, ''general\u00ad ly forecloses from executive and judicial inquiry'' the motivation behind a Con\u00ad gressman's conduct. As the Court ex\u00ad plained: The legislative privilege, protecting against possible prosecution by an unfriendly execu\u00ad tive and conViction by a hostile judiciary, is one manifestation of the \"practical security\" for ensuring the independence of the legisla\u00ad ture. I fully agree. It does indicate, how\u00ad ever, why the conflict of interest approach has been so ineffective when applied to legislatures. It has been large\u00ad ly left to legislatures to police them\u00ad selves. But history shows that legisla\u00ad tures do not police themselves. Apart from election frauds, only twice in the last 100 years has the U.S. Senate acted even to censure one of its own Members for any cause. Our public disclosure proposal has sev\u00ad eral advantages. First. It would be preventive rather than punitive. The knowledge that one's financial activities and. interests would become known would serve as a \"stop and think\" signal. At the very least, it would tend to sharpen awareness of possible confusion of public and private interests. Second. It would be nearly automatic in operation. The reports would put the facts on the table, and the press and the public could make their own judgment. So far as the executive branch is con\u00ad cerned, it would correct a vital omission in the Executive order issued in 1965 by the President. His order requires Federal employees to submit financial reports to their superiors, or in some cases to the Civil Service Commission. But these re\u00ad ports are not available to the public and availability to the press and public, as provided in our bill, is vital to the effec\u00ad tiveness of the disclosure principle. Third, disclosure would protect the right of the people to elect whomever they wished, while enhancing their right to full knowledge of the economic inter\u00ad ests and financial activities of those who represent them or who present them\u00ad selves as candidates for public office. A second section of our b111 would apply the disclosure principle to another im\u00ad portant area of governmental activity. Exercising great powers over particular segments of our economic structure, the administrative agencies are natural tar\u00ad gets for those who look to \"influence\" to press their cases. Rumors of back\u00ad door approaches, influence pedtlling, and the like are constantly circulating, and sometimes, as we know, not without cause. Our bill would deal with the problem by putting all-and I emphasize \"all\"\u00ad approaches to administrative agencies with regard to particular cases on the record. For example, all communica\u00ad tions, routine or otherwise, written or oral, formal or informal, from Members of Congress or any other\u00b7persons outside the agency itself in behalf, say, of a par\u00ad ticular application for a broadcasting license from the FCC would be made part of the public record of the case. , Here again, disclosure would be both preventive and protective-with regard to the public and also those who serve in ap\u00b7pointive office. As far back as 1951, a Senate subcom\u00ad mittee under the chairmanship of Sena\u00ad tor Paul Douglas reported to the Senate: Disclosure is like an antibiotic which can deal with ethical sicknesses in the field of public affairs. There was perhaps more gen\u00ad eral agreement upon this principle of dis\u00ad closing full information to the publlc and upon its general effectiveness than upon any other proposal. It is hardly a sanction and certainly not a penalty. It avoids dimcult decisions as to what may be right or wrong. In that sense it is not even diagnostic; yet there is confidence that it wlll be helpful in dealing with many questionable or improper practices. It would sharpen men's own judgments of right and wrong since they would be less likely to do wrong things if they knew these .acts would be challenged. The statement is as true today as it was then. Indeed, over the intervening years public and administrative recogni\u00ad tion of the usefulness of the disclosure approach has grown steadily. In 1966, the President of the United States proposed that Members of Con\u00ad gress disclose annually income received for personal services and gifts of $100 or more in cash or kind. While his rec\u00ad ommendation did not go nearly far enough, it was welcome recognition of the effectiveness of the disclosure ap\u00ad proach. Congress lags far behind. It is time we ourselves recognized, and acted on the recognition, that public disclosure is faz and away the most practicable and least painful way of maintaining the public confidence in the integrity of its Government. PRESIDENT'S CRIME COMMISSION ENDORSES VICTIM COMPENSATION Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, in recent weeks public interest has been aroused by the illuminating and compre\u00ad hensive report of President Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. Never before in our history have we had such a com\u00ad petent public assessment of our crime problems. The American people wel\u00ad come this report and the resolute action which it promises. The Crime Commission's report takes on added significance in that it em\u00ad phasizes that our crime problems are in\u00ad terwoven. The report offers persuasive evidence for the argument that the solu\u00ad tion of our crime problems requires a broad, all inclusive assault on a vast ar\u00ad ray of problems. Piecemeal solutions may slow the crime growth problem, but only a comprehensive plan can solve it. I am especially pleased by the fact that the President's Crime Commission, a dis\u00ad tinguished group of experts, has en\u00ad dorsed the principle of victim compen\u00ad sation for which I reintroduced a bill, S. 646, on January 25, 1967. The Com\u00ad mission has also done an admirable job of reporting the growth of widespread support for victim compensation. I quote from this report a passage which is par\u00ad ticularly encouraging for the supporters of victim compensation: The Commission has been impressed by the consensus among legislators and law en\u00ad forcement officials that some kind of State compensation for Victims of violent crime is desirable. Recent public opinion poUs indicate that a considerable majority of the public is in favor of victim compensation. Tlle Commission believes that the general principle of victim compensation, especial\u00ad ly to persons who suffer injury in violent crime, is sound and that the experiments now being conducted with different types of compensation programs are valuable. New Zealand was the first English\u00ad speaking jurisdiction to enact such a law, in 1963, followed by England, in 1964. This matter had been debated in the House of Lords, in England, for many years. In 1965, I introduced the first bill of this kind in Congress. Thereafter, Cal\u00ad ifornia adopted a rather limited plan. Governor Rockefeller requested and ob\u00ad tained a copy of our bill and our reports, and the state of New York has adopted a comprehensive plan for the compen\u00ad sation of the innocent victims of crime. A bill is now pending before the Com\u00ad mittee on the Judiciary, and we are hope\u00ad ful that hearings will be held this year. The committee recognizes the impor\u00ad tance of hearings being held with respect to these bills, so that the matter may be properly debated and information may be obtained. The bill that I have introduced would compensate innocent victims of violent crime to the person in the District of Columbia and other areas of Federal jurisdiction. It would not impinge upon the State's treatment of these victims in areas where the State has jurisdiction. I ask unanimous consent to have in\u00ad serted in the RECORD an excerpt, entitled ''Compensation to Victims of Crime,\" February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4681 from page 41 of the Commission's report, \"The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society.\" There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS OF CRIME Programs granting public compensation to victims for physical injuries from violent crimes have aroused increased interest in recent years. The community has evidenced concern for the plight of victims of mug\u00ad gings, stabbings, and other violence. In the absence of such programs victims generally suffer losses that are not compensated in any way. Their civll remedies are most likely to be unsuccessful because of the poor fi\u00ad nancial condition and prospects of most of\u00ad fenders. And the criminal law generally makes no effort to use its sanctions to insure restitution to the victim. Indeed it often aggravates the victim's problem by incar\u00ad cerating the offender, thus preventing him from earning money to make restitution. Two philosophies underlie the recent move\u00ad ments for victim compensation. The first argues that the government is responsible for preventing crime and therefore should be made responsible for compensating the victims of the crimes it falls to prevent. The second approach, an extension of welfare doc\u00ad trines, rests on the belief that people in need, especially those in need because they have been victimized by events they could not avoid, are entitled to public ald. The first modern victim-compensation programs were established in New Zealand and Great Britain in 1964. California's pro\u00ad gram, which became effective in the begin\u00ad ning of 1966, was the first in the United States. Only victims with limited flnancial resources qualify for compensation under this program. New York's victim-compensa\u00ad tion bill, enacted in 1966, also provides com\u00ad pensation only for those who would suffer \"serious financial hardship\" as a result of the crime. Various Federal victim-compen\u00ad sation bills, now before the Congress, have yet to receive public hearings. The Com\u00ad mission believes that such hearings would provide a national forum for a much needed debate over the philosophy, assumptions, and potential advantages and disadvantages of such programs generally, and the relative merits and design of a program on the Fed\u00ad eral level in particular. The Commission has been impressed by the consensus among legislators and law enforce\u00ad ment officials that some kind of State com\u00ad pensation for victims of violent crime is de\u00ad sirable. Recent public opinion polls indi\u00ad cate that a considerable majority of the public is in favor of victim compensation. The Commission believes that the general principle of victim compensation, especially to persons who suffer injury in violent crime, is sound and that the experiments now being conducted with different types of compen\u00ad sation programs are valuable. ADULT BASIC EDUCATION TEACH\u00ad ERS IN CROCKETT INDEPENDENT SCHOOL, HOUSTON COUNTY, TEX., VOLUNTEER TO TEACH WITHOUT PAY RATHER THAN CLOSE DOWN THEIR PROGRAM. Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, an example of the devotion to the adult basic education program felt by people all over the country is the decision of the teachers in the Crockett Inde\u00ad pendent School District, Crockett, Hous\u00ad ton County, Tex., to continue to serve without pay rather than see their pro\u00ad gram ended because no more money was available. \u00b7 CXIII--297-P~ 4. The current program began in Sep\u00ad tember 1966. When the district applied to the Texas Education Agency for funds for the second session they were in\u00ad formed that Federal money had run out and no more money, either Federal or State, was available. It was then that a majority of the teachers volunteered to serve without pay. This strong belief in the program is symptomatic of the way people feel about the program all over the country. Congress answer to this nationwide en\u00ad thusiasm should be to provide an addi\u00ad tional $10 million in supplemental funds to keep the adult basic education pro\u00ad gram operating the rest of fiscal year 1967. Congress should not say to the teachers of the country: \"either work without pay or terminate your pro\u00ad grams.\" I congratulate the teachers in the Crockett adult basic education program for their selfless dedication. I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Houston County Courier of February 16 be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ADULT BASIC EDUCATION TEACHERS VOL\u00b7 UNTEER SERVICES WITHOUT PAY A majority of the teachers in the Adult Basic Education program have assured that there will be no lapse in the classes by offer\u00ad ing to continue to teach without pay. The current Adult Basic Education Pro\u00ad gr~ will complete the first session on Feb. 23. An application has been sent to the Texas Education Agency for continuing funds, but notification has been received that the federal funds are exhausted and no ad\u00ad ditional funds are available to finance an additional term. The adult classes will continue, however, due to the unselfishness and community spirit of the teachers. A majority of the teachers, when informed that their salaries for these services would end Feb. 23, decided to continue their classes on a voluntary basis for the remainder of this year. Beginning July 1, there will be additional funds to carry on the program for next year. All of the people of Houston County can feel justly proud of these teachers for devot\u00ad ing their time and efforts, and sometimes money out of their own pockets, to the con\u00ad tinuation of the adult classes. Most persons felt that the teachers were teaching primarily for the salary, but now that they will be teaching without pay, every\u00ad one should realize that a teacher is in the teaching profession for more than just the salary. Listed are the teachers of the Adult Basic Education classes, and the ones marked with an asterisk have been teaching without pay since Sept. 6, 1966: *Vivian Lovelady, *Evola Dorn, *Delta Dailey, Alma Mathis, Sabra D. Berry, octavia s. Williams. Mary Murphy, Mittie Mae Wiley, Annie B. Steed, Vernon Grant, Eugene Dix, Beatrice Murphy, T. J. Shepherd, Addie M. Ware. Lucille M.

FOOD OUTPUT PER PERSON DID NOT INCREASE IN UNDERDEVEL\u00ad OPED NATIONS DURING 1966- UNITED STATES SHOULD MAKE MAXIMUM EFFORT TO AID THESE NATIONS IN SOLVING THEffi POP\u00ad ULATION PROBLEMS Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, the January 1967 issue of Agricultural Situation, published by the u.s. Depart\u00ad ment of Agriculture, reports that 1966 saw the world's developed areas make further gains in agricultural production per person while the less developed re\u00ad gions had to settle for no better than the year before. Agricultural output during the past dec\u00ad ade has actually gone up faster in the less developed areas than in the rest of the world- The report says-- but the benefits have been canceled out by a corresponding rapid growth in population. In the face of this continuing situa\u00ad tion, it is to be hoped by all who are con\u00ad cerned about the desperate race being run in the underdeveloped nations be\u00ad tween population growth and food sup\u00ad ply, that the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture will devote maximum effort to aiding these lands in dealing with this enormous problem. Congress last year was most definite in its intent that these agencies step up their activity. New, explicit author\u00ad ity to render assistance, at a country's request, was given in both the foreign aid bill and the food-for-peace bill. The information contained in this Ag\u00ad riculture Department report reminds us again of the seriousness of the problem and of the massive effort which must be made in order to deal with it effectively. I ask unanimous consent that an ex\u00ad cerpt from the January 1967 issue of Agricultural Situation be printed at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: As in recent past years, 1966 saw the world's developed areas make further gains in agricultural production per person while the less developed regions had to settle for no better than the year before. A per capita production gain to 110 (1957- 59=100) from 106 for the year before for the developed areas contrasted with a level of 101 for the second straight year for the less developed areas due to their faster rising populations. Agricultural output during the past dec\u00ad ade has actually gone up faster in the less developed areas than in the rest of the world. But the benefits have been canceled out'by a corresponding rapid growth in population. OPEN AID FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACTIVITY ADVOCATED BY MAX LERNER Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, on February 15, 1967, I introduce .d S. 981, a bill to authorize the Secretary of HEW to make grants to individuals broadly representative of American students for the purpose of attending international youth conferences. Rather than some secret grant, as in the case of the CIA, we would publicly make grants. 4682 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 Last week ~x Lerner wrote a very thoughtful column in which he argued that the right way to make it possible for American students to attend these con\u00ad ferences is \"to get or appropriate money for these international students activities quite openly.\" I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Lerner's article as published in the Wednesday, February 22 Washington Evening Star be published at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From the Washington Evening Star, Feb. 22, 1967) INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ACTIVITY DUE OPEN Am- (By Max Lerner) There has been a lot of stupidity on the part of the Washington people, under Eisen\u00ad hower, Kennedy and Johnson, in getting the student movement tied in with the Central Intelligence Agency, and a lot of hypocrisy on the part of some of the more bitter critics who gain cheap and easy victories flaying the CIA and the students equally. The government people saw a problem but settled for a terribly wrong solution of it. Some of the critics, both within Congress and outside, offer no solution, and perhaps see no problem. The problem is there, and it has been there sharply since the beginning of the 1950s, when the Communist camp made its shift of strategy in the political war. While main\u00ad taining their old litany about factory workers and peasants as the true revolutionary ma\u00ad terial, the Communist leaders began to put their real reliance on the intellectuals as their fulcrum of revolution. They saw that in such a struggle the weapons tipped with flame are the ideas, and so they put their energies into training, persuading, seducing, converting the carriers of ideas. For the Cummunists it made sense. They were veterans of the ideological wars, and had been attending international conferences for generations. They knew all the dodges, they had a powerful mystique that attracted the young-and they had the machinery of complete secrecy. What America had was two groups of ac\u00ad tivist students. Both had generosity and idealism as they looked at the world. But they had different angles of vision. There were those who identified romantically with revolutions and-without themselves want\u00ad ing to be Communists-felt that the future lay with the revolutionary left. But there were also those who identified strongly with democracy, but who felt frustrated because they could not find in it an adequate armory of weapons with which to meet the Commu\u00ad nists on their chosen ground of political warfare. That, however you might cut it, was the sharp edge of the problem. But the question for America was: How do you send knowl\u00ad edgeable students to all the youth confer\u00ad ences and youth congresses that the Soviet camp knew so well to mount? How do you pay their way without leaving them open to the charge of being stooges of the govern\u00ad ment that subsidized them? The problem was real. The solution found, of subsidizing student organizations secretly by the CIA, was an idiot one. I have heard two lines of defense of it. One is pragmatic: \"It worked, didn't it?\" {the Allen Dulles defense, presumably). The other is one of bruised innocence: \"We were sure we could count on everyone's patriotism and sense of responsib111ty not to reveal it.\" The answer to the bruised ones is that the notions of what is patriotic and responsible will differ.\u00b7 At some point someone is bound to be in on the secret who gets religion and i6 driven to confess all. The wondrous thing is not that the secret was broken but that it took so long to break. As for the pragmatic line about its \"working,\" my answer is that it worked for a while, yes, but only a narrow vision would believe that the manipulation paid off. When the lid blew off, it blew dis\u00ad astrously, and neither the government nor the student movements--which will be so vulnerable abroad now-will be able to make up for the damage in prestige for some time. It \"worked\"? Only if you say that, given the end, the quality of the means makes little importance. But one of the things that a democracy prides itself on is that it does care about means. And covert means in this case were wrong means. And did it \"work\" for the young men who must now be counted as its victims, because they were forced into a corroding secrecy and must now face the judgment of a hostile world? Did it finally ''work\" for all the young people who were not in the secret at all, who now find that unwittingly they were along used all the time? I don't intend this against the CIA as such. Intelligence agencies are normal and neces\u00ad sary in an absurd world, and the United States may be the only major country in the world that keeps lambasting its intelligence services constantly. All I am saying is that the CIA should stick to its knitting, which doesn't include subterranean support or manipulation of student movements, not . even under the spur of the competitive war\u00ad fare of ideas. We have tried the wrong way. Why not try a right way for a change? And the right way? It is to get or appro\u00ad priate money for these international stu\u00ad dents activities quite openly. The money itself may be government money {Why not? We spend it for far less important things) or else mixed government and foundation money. America has a powerful weapon, in the foundation, which no other nation has to the same extent. Why not use it? But however the money gets furnished, it should be administered non-governmentally and openly. It will make things harder for the students, at least for a while, but not nearly as hard as they have been made by the blunders of covert manipulation. EDUCATION AND HEALTH Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, the Senate today has received a message on education and health from the Presi\u00ad dent of the United States. I wish to commend this message to my colleagues as a document that is compassionate and imaginative, reason\u00ad able and responsive in meeting our ob\u00ad ligations to the health and welfare .of the American people. President Johnson has rightly noted that these programs are fundamental to our most coveted aspirations for in\u00ad dividual fulfillment, and represent an investment in our most previous natural resource: our people. No American President has accom\u00ad plished more to advance the quality of education and health services available to our people 'than has President John\u00ad son. The 89th Congress can be truly called \"the Education Congress\" for the amount of historic legislation it passed in this field. And yet, our vibrant, growing Nation demands that still more be done to pro\u00ad vide adequate r~sources and services in our schools, hospitals, research institutes, and health centers. The . President's proposals are based on careful study and sound research. In education, the President requests programs to help State and local agen-cies evaluate their own educational pro\u00ad grams; he asks for an expansion of our National Teacher Corps programs; and recommends bold initiatives in the neglected fields of vocational training, educational television, adult education, and in the development of computers in education. These programs are responsive to def\u00ad inite needs in our educational establish\u00ad ment. They will help us to continue the progress we have achieved in recent years. All of these programs, in my judgment, will have long-range benefits that may well determine the vitality and capacity of American education for years to come. In the field of health, the President is asking that we continue to build on the accomplishments of the past several years. He recommends expanded sup\u00ad port for cancer and biomedical research and for our health manpower resources. He requests improvement of the com\u00ad munity mental health program and studies to improve and strengthen health protection for our industrial workforce. He recommends that we ini\u00ad tiate a new program to help the deaf and blind; that we expand our neighbor\u00ad hood health centers for the poor; and that we extend medicare coverage to seriously disabled Americans \u00b7 under 65. These, and other of the President's health proposals, are fundamental to the security and welfare we seek for the American people. As a member of the Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare I have aided in the support of all educational and public health legislation of this Nation in the past 9 years, beginning with the Na\u00ad tional Defense Education Act of 1958, which I had the privilege of cospon\u00ad soring. I believe that President Johnson has forwarded to us a reasonable blueprint for progress in these vital fields that we can well afford. In addition I feel sure that many of my co1leagues have sound health and education proposals which should receive favorable consideration by Congress. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support progress recommended in this message and help us to continue the progress that will make America in the 1960's the most enlightened and humane society the world has ever known. POSTAL AUTOMATION AND MODERNIZATION Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, the distinguished Assistant Postmaster Gen\u00ad eral for Research and Engineering, Dr. Leo 8. Packer, recently addressed the Oklahoma Advertising Club on the vital\u00ad ly important topic of postal automation and modernization. Dr. Packer has brought new skill and leadership to the Post O:tnce Department and I am very hopeful that the Depart\u00ad ment's program for modernization will progress rapidly to improve our national mail service. I ask unanimous consent that there be inserted in the RECORD at this point two articles from the Oklahoma Journal and the Oklahoma City Times concerning Dr. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4683 Packer's address and the subject which he discussed. There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: (From the Oklahoma City Times, Feb. 1, 1967] RESEARCH CHIEF LoOKS TO FUTURE MAn. PRoB\u00ad LEMs--SoRRY, AUNT MINNIE, BUT POST OFFICE TRIES If Aunt Minnie's latest letter arrived six days late at the wrong address, Dr. Leo S. Packer is sorry about that. An assistant U. S. postmaster general heading the new Bureau of Research and Engineering, he knows it's important to solve day by day breakdowns in the massive postal system. \u00b7But he is more concerned with bigger prob\u00ad lems looming in later years if the postal de\u00ad partment doesn't develop \"a management and control structure as progressive and adaptable to change as any modern indus\u00ad try.\" Dr. Packer was 1n Oklahoma City Wednes\u00ad day to speak at an Advertising Club \"Direct Mail Day\" luncheon. In an interview, he described his hopes for building a postal operation meeting 20th century needs. The enthusiastic engineering PhD said realization of \"the need to look ahead\" is just dawning. \"We have been much too preoccupied with the problems of today, serious as they are,\" he said. . \"We must look ahead and anticipate tech\u00ad nical developments, so that we won't con\u00ad tinue to just be 1n a passive and defensive position of trying to meet problems as they come up.\" Dr. Packer is pioneering, as the first presi\u00ad dential appointee to take the special assist\u00ad antship when the old office of research was beefed up to bureau status last August. He brings industrial know-how from Bausch & Lomb, where he was with the space and defense division, and from Xerox Corp., where he was responsible for specialized gov\u00ad ernment research and development con\u00ad tracts. Dr. Packer said the first task is assembling a trained corps to tackle postal updating from all directions. Key areas haven't had staff specialists 1n the past, including human-factors engineer\u00ad ing, communications engineering, research\u00ad ers on mechanical systems reliab111ty, and operations research. \"We have to start from scratch in these important areas,\" he said. He predicted im\u00ad pact of the new studies won't be felt for five to 10 years .. \"You can't just say, 'Lo and behold, here is our brand new postal system'. It will take time, and effort, and money from congress,' he said. Dr. Packer is optimistic about the bureau's budget fate when congress takes a look at it next month. He hopes to gain almost a 50 percent increase in research and develop\u00ad ment funds. That would provide a number of new posi\u00ad tions for a staff now number.ing more than 500. He is sure the road to better, faster, cheap\u00ad er mall service methods is open, but he doesn't claim traveling the road will be a one-rhan job. \"We're a long way from industrial stand\u00ad ards, and I don't expect to do it by myself,\" he said. \"I'll just need to needle the right people and put money into the right con\u00ad tracts.\" [From the Oklahoma Journal, Feb. 2, 1967] \"SEXIEST\"-IF NOT FASTEST: POSTAL DEPART MENT UPSET WITH IMAGE Dr. Leo S. Packer, assistant postmaster general, Bureau of Research and Engineer-ing, Wednesday told an Oklahoma City audi\u00ad ence that \"the postal department is quite concerned with changing its image.\" \"The present image isn't a very flattering one,\" he said. \"Most individuals think of the system as operating on a non-professional basis. They equate it with lack of change.\" In an address to Oklahoma City's Advertis\u00ad ing Club, Dr. Packer explained, \"But by getting the kind of people who have drive, skills, ambition and communications ability, we're going to make the postal department one of the sexiest government agencies in Washington.\" Dr. Packer indicated that lack of funds for research and engineering in the past has hamstrung postal system development. Creation of the new bureau, he said, is a step toward rectifying the situation. \"We're involved in all sorts of things,\" he asserted. \"Everything from the design of functional and pleasant post offices to the development of efficient optical scanners to consideration of the special needs of postal vehicles to the conception of new types of conveyor mechanisms. \"All sorts of new engineering specialties are being called upon. The design of post of\u00ad fices must, for the first time, meet the re\u00ad quirements of the build-ings' intent. No longer do we construct a building and then place the equipment as best we can. Now we're designing the building to meet the needs of the equipment and of the people who will operate it.\" The ZIP code and other mechanization techniques, said Dr. Packer, \"have enabled us to forestall rate increases and have kept the size of such increases to a minimum when they did become necessary.\" Rate increases recently proposed would al\u00ad low the system to operate $82 million in the black by 1968, contrasted with a $597 million deficit which will result if they are not en\u00ad acted, Dr. Packer said. \"From now on we're going to be exploring all of the possibilities. We'll be scrutinizing all of the latest developments, and adapting them to our use. \"This is a big country with a huge mall volume. So there can be no denying that the task which lies before us is a challenging one. But I believe we can meet the chal\u00ad lenge,\" Dr. Packer concluded. Mr. MciNTYRE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. NAVAL BOMBARDMENT OF VIETNAM Mr. MciNTYRE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. CLARK] plans to introduce in the Senate a resolu\u00ad tion calling for cessation of bombing at\u00ad tacks on North Vietnam. It is in that context, therefore, that I wish to make the following remarks. Mr. President, during the past week\u00ad end, the U.S. Government announced that it had implemented its strategic bombing of North Vietnam to include deployment of naval gunfire against strategic targets north of the 17th par\u00ad allel. During my recent trip to Vietnam, I found that field commanders were anxious to secure this additional gun\u00ad fire for their operations against the Hanoi regime. I believe that naval bom\u00ad bardment is an essential and reasonable implementation of our efforts to con\u00ad vince North Vietnam that it can never hope to win this war. My trip convinced me that only by steadily increasing the pressure against the North Vietnamese can we hope to shorten the duration of this war. I, therefore, fully support the Presi\u00ad dent's decision to utilize naval bombard\u00ad ment against North Vietnam and sin\u00ad cerely hope that this strategy will be continued and perhaps increased if North Vietnam continues to refuse to join us at the conference table. Mr. President, naval gunfire has long been considered by many of us to be an absolutely necessary element of our strategic bombing against North Viet\u00ad nam; and it is reassuring that the Pentagon has finally seen fit to authorize this important increase in our opera\u00ad tions. Naval gunfire offers many ad\u00ad vantages over air bombardment. Naval gunfire has greater accuracy; it is less vulnerable to enemy attack; it is more effective in hitting hardened targets not easily destroyed by air attack; it pro\u00ad vides an all-weather capability; and, most important, it will not only destroy enemy targets, but will also provide round-the-clock interdiction of repair efforts. Aircraft attacks come and go. The time lag between primary attacks and return sorties to interdict repair efforts may be as long as 2 or 3 days because of uncertain weather conditions over the north. This often gives North Vietna\u00ad mese crews just the time they need to make repairs and continue their infiltra\u00ad tion into the south. Naval attacks would be continuous, causing serious problems to repair crews and infiltration of men and supplies into the south. Today, North Vietnam has a three\u00ad pronged defense against air attack\u00ad antiaircraft guns, Mig-21 jet fighters, and Russian-built missiles. This, and the uncertainties of weather conditions over the north, have hampered bombing sorties and have caused high attrition in aircraft and manpower. Naval gun\u00ad fire can effectively counter the North Vietnamese air defense network and cut down dramatically on aircraft and manpower attrition, all at a much lower cost. Mr. President, because there is a pos\u00ad sibility that we may be in Vietnam for a long duration, I would also like to sug\u00ad gest the possibility that the United States give most serious consideration to re\u00ad activating two heavy battleships which are now in the Reserve Fleet. It would take approximately 1 year to reactivate these heavy battleships and the cost of reactivating these battleships would be between $16 and $27.5 million. How\u00ad ever, I feel that the. cost is worth it if we can cut down on huge losses of air\u00ad craft. I feel that the length of time it takes to reactivate each battleship is worthwhile if, in the end, we can shorten the war by bringing this substantially in\u00ad creased pressure against the North Viet\u00ad namese. I sometimes wonder why we ever de\u00ad activated our heavy battleships. As an economy move alone, this would have been a mistake, because I believe that there is a role for the heavy battleship in our strategic requirements. If these battleships had not been deactivated, they could be put to immediate use in the Vietnam theater of operations. 4684 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 During World War II and the Korean war, our Nation developed an expertise in the use of naval shore bombardment. A high degree of coordination with shore-based troops and air attacks great\u00ad ly facilitated the attainment of our stra\u00ad tegic objectives and contributed signifi\u00ad cantly to the safety of our own troops. In spite of the fact that Vietnam has hundreds of miles of coastline , the tech\u00ad niques learned in World War II and the Korean war have not been put to good use in the present conflict. Battleships have innumerable advantages over any other naval weapons we now possess-\u00ad greater gun range, greater security against attack from any source, greater endurance and staying power, capability of exerting a greater psychological effect against an enemy, and greater accuracy against enemy targets--all at a consid\u00ad erably reduced cost. Naval bombardment from destroyers, cruisers, and heavy battleships is a nec\u00ad essary ingredient of our success in Viet\u00ad nam; and I am in complete accord with any proposal to extend the scope of this activity to more targets and strategic objectives in the north. The Hanoi regime's reaction to our decision to deploy naval bombardment against targets north of the 17th parallel was typically vocal. The Hanoi regime is loud in its denunciation of this in\u00ad creased pressure. Whether the Hanoi regime finds this increased pressure in\u00ad tolerable or not, I do not know.' But I do know that we find Hanoi's continued intransigence both unacceptable and intolerable and will continue to mount steadily increasing pressure until Hanoi finally chooses the course of least resist\u00ad ance--the conference table. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. MciNTYRE. I am delighted to yield to the Senator from West Virginia. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New Hampshire on the fine re\u00ad marks he has just made. He is an alert, active, and conscien\u00ad tious member of the Committee on Armed Services. He has recently completed a visit to South Vietnam. I am sure that the committee and the Senate will bene\u00ad fit from his advice and certainly from the observations he made during his visit to South Vietnam. I associate myself with the Senator when he recommends that our Govern\u00ad ment bring increasing military pressure to bear upon North Vietnam. In my judgment, this will be the best way to bring the North Vietnamese to the conference table and, thereby, hasten the end of the military conflict. I also join the Senator in his expres\u00ad sions of support for naval bombardment. I support his position that an expansion of naval bombardment against additional targets is in order and very much needed. I also associate myself with the Sen\u00ad ator's remarks regarding reactivation of battleships. I congratulate the Senator once again and thank him for yielding to me. Mr. MciNTYRE. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, a senior member on the Armed Services Committee. I am particularly gratified to find that he feels the same way I do, that con\u00ad tinued military pressure on Hanoi is, in the last analysis, the best way to bring the not so little war in Vietnam to an honorable conclusion. NOMINATION OF RAMSEY CLARK TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. Presi\u00ad dent, I commend President Johnson for his excellent choice in nominating Ram\u00ad sey Clark to be Attorney General of the United States. The President has sent to the Senate many outstanding nomi\u00ad nations, but this is one of the best. Of course, it was not entirely unexpected that Ramsey Clark would be the Presi\u00ad dent's choice, but it is good to have the nomination official. Ramsey for some time, now, has served as Acting Attorney General as well as Deputy Attorney General, and he has proven himself well qualified to carry the heavy responsibility of this office. . He is a man dedicated to justice and the preservation of the rights of man. I have been particularly impressed by his actions in the area of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping. He is the first Attorney General actually to come to grasp with the total privacy problem as it is affected by wiretapping and electronic snooping. Too often in the past, Attorneys General have fol\u00ad lowed the course of least resistance and have failed to provide the leadership necessary to strengthen privacy. In addition to his many other quali\u00ad fications, Ramsey Clark is also a good administrator, as is shown by his record as Assistant Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General. Mr. President, I know the Senate will give this nomination early consideration and that Ramsey Clark will soon be con\u00ad firmed as the Attorney General of the United States. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. President, President Johnson has just announced his intention to appoint Ramsey Clark as Attorney General o.f the United States. Most of us in the Senate have had a chance to get to know Mr. Clark, and I think we can all agree that his appointment will be one of the finest any President has ever made. President Kennedy appointed Ramsey Clark as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Lands Division of the Justice Department almost exactly 6 years ago. Mr. Clark did an outstand\u00ad ing job in this position, and in February of 1965 became Deputy Attorney Gen\u00ad eral. He was instrumental in assisting the President and Attorney General Katzenbach in securing passage of such landmark legislation as the Voting Rights Act and the Law Enforcement Assistance Act, and he had the oppor\u00ad tunity to observe at firsthand the dif\u00ad ficult days of the Selma to Montgomery march and the awesome aftermath of the Watts conflagration. Since last October 3, Mr. Clark has been Acting At\u00ad torney General, and we have seen the mark of his work in the President's crime and civil rights programs and in yesterday's fine message on the District of Colwnbia. Mr. President, this route to the At\u00ad torney Generalship-from Assistant At\u00ad torney General, to Deputy Attorney General, to Acting Attorney General\u00ad is the route which gave us Mr. Clark's predecessor, Nicholas Katzenbach, who did such an excellent job. It means we have a man with experience in the De\u00ad partment and with good relations on Capitol Hill. I look forward to Mr. Clark's quick confirmation, and to many more years of imaginative leadership in 'the Justice Department. Mr. BURDICK. Mr. President, word has just reached me that President John\u00ad son has nominated Acting Attorney Gen\u00ad eral Ramsey Clark to become Attorney General. I hasten to congratulate the President \u00b7on his choice and Mr. Clark on his nomination. He brings to this Cabinet position a considerable amount of experience-\u00ad over 10 years in the private practice of law; 6 years as an Assistant Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, and Acting Attorney General. Mr. President, I know my colleagues join me in wishing Mr. Clark well. He has demonstrated his devotion to the law. I am confident he possesses the leader\u00ad ship and the ability to meet the challeng\u00ad ing responsibilities of the office. THE CIA Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Cen\u00ad tral Intelligence Agency is criticized much too freely and at the slightest, flimsiest provocation, by all too many of our leading \"opinion makers\" in both public and private life. The sputtering indignation of the past week over the fact that the CIA has been doing what it should do, would be amusing were it not illustrative of an appalling lack of understanding of the proper functions of an intelligence agen\u00ad cy in a cold war situation. For the CIA to help finance these var\u00ad ous activities is not indicative of a diseased society. It is rather a sign that a healthy so\u00ad ciety is taking the pragmatic action that is necessary to preserve itself in a diffi\u00ad cult, demanding, and often tumultuous world. I do not intend to speak at any length today, in defense of the CIA. Rather, my purpose in making these brief comments is to introduce into the RECORD an article by Carl T. Rowan, entitled \"In Defense of the CIA's Under\u00ad cover 'Links'.\" Mr. Rowan has had a distinguished career in Government and as a news\u00ad paperman. On the basis of his expe\u00ad rience, he is better qualified than most to make a judgment on the Agency's assist\u00ad ance in the financing of student, labor, and other private groups. Mr. Rowan writes: It must be reckoned one of the great public relations failures of American history that the CIA has not won acceptance for its clandestine activities on the valid ground that it is fighting the same deadly struggle as the FBI. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4685 I agree fully with this accurate and tragic statement. The feeling that the CIA can do no right is all too prevalent in our country today. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this realistic and able article re\u00ad printed in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: IN DEFENSE OF THE CIA's UNDERCOVER \"LINKS\" (By carl T. Rowan) When the stream of criticism and con\u00ad tempt for the Central Intelligence Agency rolls so forcefully and resolutely, one ris\u00b7ks all manner of accusations if he moves against the tide. But move against it I must, for there are some tragic aspects of the furor over the CIA's financing student, labor and other private groups that have not been given adequate attention. Surely I break no vows of secrecy made in my. government days if I say now that this string of \"exposes\" of CIA associations can go on and on. There are dozens of yet un\u00ad named groups that cooperated with CIA\u00ad simply because they believed it to be in their children's and the nation's interest. I admire one of them-the Hobby Founda\u00ad tion of Houston, Texas-for publicly ex\u00ad pressing pride in having cooperated. The disciplines of self-acclaimed intellec\u00ad tualism, or liberalism, or idealism compel some people to deplore these private in\u00ad volvements in the dirty business of waging a cold war. They say the health of the nation requires that our press, universities, students et a.l. remain \"free of government manipulation.\" I cannot understand the schizophrenia that has caused these purists to exempt the Federal Bureau of Investigation from criti\u00ad cism for so long. The FBI has its hand, and agents, in far more domestic organizations than the CIA. But somehow the press and the public have accepted that as necessary to trap those frightful spies and saboteurs. It must be reckoned one of the great pub\u00ad lic relations failures of American hi&tory that the CIA has not won acceptance for its clandestine activities on the valid ground that it is fighting the same deadly struggle as the FBI. As the tedious string of \"revelations\" un\u00ad winds, I conclude that American opinion\u00ad molders have become almost as psychotic about \"the CIA\" as those foreigners who talk as though the agency is capable of over\u00ad throwing their governments on five minutes' notice. The harsh truth is that these exposures have destroyed the CIA as an effective in\u00ad strument in many arenas of the cold war that is still being waged furiously, ~pite the recent talk about \"detente.\" SO what the Communists spent billions-unsuccessfully\u00ad to do, we Americans, out of our idealism, have delivered to them as a gift. It disturbs me that this rush to bare CIA \"links\" has tainted ''Crossroads Africa,\" the \"American Society for African Culture\" and other groups that have worked honestly and intelllgently to keep alive in mllllons of Africans a faith and hope in democracy. Sanctilnonious, theoretically correct argu\u00ad ments that \"private business and industry\" should have provided the funds demolish themselves against one hard fact.: Business and industry had neither the interest, the attitudes nor the inclination to support these efforts properly. It bothers me that these \"revelations\" have compromised, perhaps fatally in some cases, hundreds of young men and women who might have become leaders of the develop\u00ad ing nations. The wounds inflicted upon the Alliance for Progress are grave. Many a U.S. Peace Corps worker or diplo\u00ad mat, and numerous foreign scholars and labor leaders who have struggled bravely in the cause of freedom, will have their integ\u00ad rity impugned and their fUtures jeopard\u00ad ized before this great expose fizzles out. Sure, one can say the CIA built this colos\u00ad sal tragedy by wrongly involving all these peoples and groups in the first place. I say nonsense. Several presidents, sev\u00ad eral cabinets, dozens of congressmen and the leaders of all the groups involved went into this business with their eyes wide open. And it wasn't because of an ugly assumption that the ends justify the means, as some ideal\u00ad ists argue. They made a practical recogni\u00ad tion of the fact that the adversary had al\u00ad ready set the dirty rules of battle, so either we played by his rules or got our brains beaten out. \u00b7 I can't find it in my journalistic heart to say the press is wrong to dredge up all it has about CIA \"covers.\" Yet, I have an uneasy feeling that in pursuit of a hallowed bit of journalis \u00b7tic dogma, we are slaying some dragons that will come back to haunt our prog.eny. I keep remembering President Kennedy saying to the American Newspaper Publish\u00ad ers Association in 1961: \"This nation's foes have openly boasted of acquiring through our newspapers informa\u00ad tion they would otherwise hire agents to ac\u00ad quire through\u00b7 theft, bribery or espionage ... \"Today no war has been declared-and however fierce the struggle, it may never be declared in traditional fashion ... \"If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security.'' . Is it heresy for me to ask whether the bene\u00ad fits to \"freedom\" accruing from these ex\u00ad poses of the CIA are great enough to balance out the damage done to our security? GREENLAND HALIBUT IS NOT NORTH PACIFIC HALmUT Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, a situation that is unfair to the American consuming public and the cause of great damage to one of the Nation's important commercial fisheries Ls occurring today in the marketplace. \u00b7 A product labeled as \"Greenland\" halibut is masquerading as true halibut in the fresh and frozen food cases of the Nation's food stores, despite the fact that the so-called Greenland halibut is not only inferior in taste and texture, but fails to an even greater degree in the nutritive values which have helped build a strong and stable market for the North Pacific-produced species. I have had considerable comment from the consum\u00ad ing public, who feel that they are being misled and cheated; and the method of merchandising the imported product is such that our own fishermen and indus\u00ad try are bearing the brunt of much of this assault. I have in my possession numerous newspaper advertisements promoting this inferior imported product. Some of them, it is true, use the term \"Green\u00ad land,\" but in almost every case it is sub\u00ad jugated and nearly hidden, and a large number of others refer only to halibut. A survey of actual market showcases throughout the country by the American industry indicates that only the word \"halibut\" is being used, and the public is purchasing this inferior product, con\u00ad fident that they are receiving the high\u00ad quality and nutritious product to which they have long been accustomed. The situation must be halted by the Govern\u00ad ment agencies concerned. For some 5 years now, the Halibut As\u00ad sociation of North America has spent considerable sums of money and untold effort in building a market for the highly prized North :r;>acific halibut. Not only is the inferior imported product profit\u00ad ing from that effort, but they are doing untold damage, for the housewife will now be wary in her future fishery pur\u00ad chases. As the result of heavy imports of ~\u00b7Greenland\" halibut, the markets for our own Pacific Northwest product have been falling otr to a point where hold\u00ad ings are now at a high and dangerous level. It is estimated that the value of the 1967 halibut catch from the North Pacific Ocean may be from $6 to $10 million dollars less than that of the 1966 catch. There is no problem for the scientist to distinguish between these two spe\u00ad cies. The Greeniand variety is called ''Reinhardtius hippoglossoides.\" The true halibut-the one the housewife thinks she is buying-is called \"Hip\u00ad poglossus Stenolepis.\" Mr. President, scientifically, these are different species, they are of different texture, taste, and quality, and the re\u00ad spective agencies of Government must act quickly not only for the protection of the consumer, but for the welfare of one of the west coast's oldest fisheries. The International Pacific Halibut Commission, which exists under treaty between the United States and Canada is one of the world's respected conserva~ tion agencies, and its record in main\u00ad taining these stocks at high level and the industry in a healthy economic cli\u00ad mate, has come about only through decades of sacrifice by both fisherman and processor. To allow this great in\u00ad dustry to face economic collapse and at the same time continue to mislead the American consumer is not only unthink\u00ad able, but must receive immediate at\u00ad tention and action by the U.S. Govern\u00ad ment. ARE YOU HOLDING UP THE U.S. MAIL? Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President. all citizens desire speedy, efficient postal service at a reasonable cost. They are entitled to that. The Post omce De\u00ad partment is perhaps one of the most criti\u00ad cized of all Government Departments and for the reason that it affects the daily lives of all Americans. We sometimes lose sight of the fact that officials of the Post Office Depart\u00ad ment are doing their utmost to improve the operation of their Department and to provide Americans with swift postal service. On February 16, 1967, the Wellston, Ohio, Telegram, published an excellent editorial entitled ''Are You Holding Up the U.S. Mail?\" urging readers of that newspaper to cooperate in ZIP coding their mail. In doing so, this newspaper performed a fine public service. I hope that other newspapers 4686 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 throughout the country will follow this example. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the editorial be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the editori,al was ordered to be printed in the REcoRD, as follows: ARE You HOLDING UP THE U.S. MAIL? The time has come for the public to be aware that Zip Coding in the U.S. mails is vitally important. The mails are swelling each year to the point that service rendered under the old system is slowing up deliveries. Postmaster General, Lawrence F. O'Brien stated, \"You can help your Post Office pro\u00ad vide the finest and most efficient mail serv\u00ad ice in the world by joining in the Zip Code Campaign. Your support is vital to the suc\u00ad cess of this program. We are counting on your .help.\" Only about half of the letters mailed by individuals are now Zip Coded. Part of this is due to the fact that some people are not aware of its tremendous importance in the efficient handling of mail. Surely everyone has heard of Zip Code by this time. Some folks think of it as just a favor to the post office-something to do if they happen to think of it. But the Zip Code is much, much ~ore than that. ' Zip helps our postal worker move mail ~he modern way. With Zip they can sort it faster and deliver it by more direct routes. With Zip they will use modern electronic machines that \"read\" Zip numbers and sort mail fifteen times faster than was possible before. People who don't use Zip Code hold up the mail for themselves and for everyone else. As long as the \u00b7~Zip gap\" exists, the Post Office must operate on both the old and the new systems, simultaneously. This cancels out many of the advantages inherent in Zip code. When you plunk down a nickel for a stamp, you \"should\" get the world's most efficient postal service in return. But-if you haven't added the Zip Code to the mailing address, you may not get all you are paying for. A single unzipped letter can slow up the mail at six post offices. At Christmas-time, the post .offices, includ\u00ad ing ours here in Wellston, issued cards ask\u00ad ing the public to fill in the names and ad\u00ad d.resses of their correspondents and bring them back and they would supply the zip codes. How many did this? The response was not too great. Henceforth, things are in the \"gap\" stage here in Wellston. So remember: Always add Zip Code to every address you write. If you do not know the number, call your post office or look it up in their Zip Qode Directory. Also remember to add your Zip Code to your return address too. That makes it easier for others to Zip their mail to you. We're always growling about the postal service-but possibly we are to blame. Let's get the Zip Codes on our mail. Mail moves the country-Zip Code moves the mail. THE UNREST I.N CHINA Mr. FONG. Mr. President, the current unrest and chaos that are dominating Red China's political, social, and cultural life have been the focus of attention and interest of many Americans, especially our \"China watchers.\" China's size and population make her an important and decisive factor in our study of and dealings in international affairs. What happens in China as are\u00ad sult of the current \"cultural revolution\" could be of great importance to the Unit-ed States. It could conceivably alter our policy toward Red China a great deal. \u00b7 Recently Dr. Stephen Pan, director of the East Asian Research Institute, wrote a very informative letter to the Christian Science Monitor revealing and explaining some of the important though lesser known reasons for the cultural purge. He aptly explains why Mao and Lin Piao are unable to utilize the Communist Party, the Young Communist League, or the Government to deal with the \"re\u00ad visionists.\" I highly recommend this short but per\u00ad ceptive article to my colleagues. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent to have printed in the RECORD Dr. Pan's letter to the Christian Science Monitor. There being no objection, the letter to the editor was ordered to be printed in the REcoRD, as follows: RED GUARDS NEW YORK. To the Christian Science Monitor: Elizabeth Pond's recent article on \"What's afoot in Red China?\" is rather concise, but still comprehensiye . on the Chinese Commu\u00ad nist Party and the Red Guards. Since she relies primarily on non-Chinese .sources, her article is as good as could be expected. I should like to suggeet some more up-to-dat!3 information and add further light ta the subject matter. . Miss Pond offers various explanations of the Red Guard movement, enumerating the power struggle, ideology, pragmatic opposi\u00ad tion and business as usual. It i:3 not a single factor which has made it possible, but all these factors together with others having caused it to come into existence. Tl;l.ere are other even more important factor~ which have induced Mao and Lin to use the young\u00ad sters (between 14 and 18) as an instrument to purge their oppon~nts. These may be briefly mentioned as follows: ( 1) Many intellectual leaders including educators and writers have turned against Mao and Maoism .. To cope with this trend, Mao and Lin launched their \"Great Prole\u00ad tarian Cultural Re:volution.\" (2) The Mao-Lin group uses the Red Guards as a tool to liquidate the bourgeois elements and the party-government \"au\u00ad thorities.\" Yet Mao and Lin\u00b7 do not and cannot invoke the Il!8Jlle of the party or the government to punish the opposition. (3) The party newspaper, the People's Daily, for some time secretly opposed Mao's infallib111ty. But Lin Piao's own paper, the Liberation revisionism, sug\u00ad gested the \"Cultural Revolution\" and insti\u00ad gated the Red Guards, whose main mouth\u00ad piece it now is. (4) All the activities of the Young Chinese Communist League have been halted. All universities and...colleges have been suspended for slx months and it is unlikely that they wlll be reopened in the next semester. The Red Guards provide a substitute. ( 5) If the Red Guards fail to acomplish their objectives, Mao and Lin and the others could say that they are not responsible. In other words, since Mao and Lin are un\u00ad able to use the Communist Party, the Young Communist League or the government to cope with the situation, they have to utilize the Red Guards to launch an unprecedented scale of purges to liquidate their opposition. The \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" aims at uprooting all the traditional Chinese cultural heritages by using the Red Guards. Lin Piao, heir apparent of Mao, made an un\u00ad usually strong speech in September, 1965, de\u00ad nouncing \"American Imperialism\" and \"So\u00ad viet Revisionism.\" Thus, after Mao, it is most unlikely that the Chinese Communists under Lin, will adopt a more conpiliatory policy toward the United States and the So\u00ad viet Union. STEPHEN c. Y. PAN, Ph. D., Director, East Asian Research Institute. POLICE CHIEF LIU OF HONOLULU BACKS FIREARMS CONTROL BILL Mr. FONG. Mr. President, during ex\u00ad tensive hearings conducted last year on firearms control legislation by the Ju\u00ad diciary Subcommittee on Juvenile De\u00ad linquency, of which I am a member, law\u00ad enforcement officers from across the Nation testified that the need for Fed\u00ad eral legislation on this matter was an urgent necessit~. These local officials noted that present state laws and local ordinances have been unable to cope with the increasing number of crimes in which firearms are used. Without dissent, they agreed that one of the chief causes of this problem is the relative ease with which any pe:.:son can acquire firearms, especially rifles and shotguns. A detailed report recently sent to me by the chief of police of the city and county of Honolulu, Mr. Dan Liu-a nationally recognized . authority on law enforcement, past president of the Inter\u00ad national Association of Chiefs of Police, and life member of. that organization's executive committe~orroborates all of this testimony and renders it directly applicable to Honolulu. \u00b7 The data furnished to me by Chief Li~ has been requested by the subcommittee. They reveal that during 1965 on the island of Oahu, 193 handguns, 46 rifles, and 7 shotguns were used in 246 of the total of 773 cases in which crimes were committed-including murder, robbery, aggravated assault, suicides, and illegal possession of firearms. \u00b7 During a 9-month period in 1966, from January 1 to September 30, a total of 126 handguns, 47 rifles, and 1 shotgun were used in 174 out of 644 cases. These statistics, according to Chief Liu, graphically illustrate \"the serious\u00ad ness of the problem of the use of fire\u00ad arms.\" To illustrate his\u00b7 point, he cited the following occurrences in Honolulu dur\u00ad ing the past 2 years: First. A police officer killed while pa\u00ad troling his beat l:>Y an ex-convict with a sawed-oft carbine. Second. A sniper who placed himself at a vantage point on a hillside and used a rifle to shoot at a group of tourists sightseeing on a bus and at two police officers investigating the incident. Third. A supermarket employee killed with a carbine during a holdup. Fourth. A service station attendant killed after a holdup of the service sta\u00ad tion. Fifth. Many cases in which criminals were armed with handguns and rifles in their possession when arrested. Chief Liu pointed out that while State laws in Hawaii regulate and control the acquisition, use, and ownership of fire\u00ad arms, control over rifles and shotguns was deleted from the law in 1955. He indicated that an attempt will be made in the current session of the State legis-February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4687 lature to reinstate control over rifles and shotguns. The problem of firearms control in Hawaii is aggravated, said Chief Liu, be\u00ad cause, he explained: Ex-servicemen have brought home and wlll continue to bring home firearms from the war front, especially carbines which are the made-to-order type of weapon for criminal use in their activities, and the easy importa- tion of surplus military weapons. \u00b7 With no requirement to register rifies, the need of revealing their possession is elimi\u00ad nated, and anyone in possession of \u00b7govern\u00ad ment property is not subject to questioning. Furthermore, Chief Liu pointed out . that the laclk of requirement to register afi ords an easy and free barter of rifles and shotguns between individuals, even to criminals and mentally incompetent persons. Because State laws are effective in maintaining control of firearms within a State only, Chief Liu urged Congress to adopt a stringent firearms law-a law which would provide \"adec_ uate and posi\u00ad control over interstate com\u00ad merce in firearms, to-make it possible for States to impose more effective controls over firearms.\" \u00b7\u00b7 The chief pointed out that firearms are obtained through mail order or common carrier delivery, and may be purchased by any person from an out-of-State licensed dealer and brought into the purchaser's resident State without conforming with the registration requirements of the resi\u00b7 dent State. 1 No matter how strict a particular State's firearms control law may be, then, that law may easily be circumvented by simply going to another State with less strict laws to buy a firearm. \u00b7 . This is -possible, Chief Liu expl~ined. because a search is \"unauthorized, illegal, and cannot be conducted of each and every package, baggage, and person that comes into a State.\" ' . As a result, Honolulu police were \u00b7un\u00ad able to determine the source of 44 hand\u00ad guns, seven rifles, and two shotguns in 1965, and 34 handguns and four rifles in 1966. . Moreover, the breakdown of the fire\u00ad arms used in the crimes of murder, rob\u00ad bery, and -aggravated assault into their sources of origin which Chief Liu fur\u00ad nished indicates that the majority were illegally acquired. ' Chief Liu concluded that- The primary source of availab111ty (of fire\u00ad arms to criminals) is through interstate traftlc of firearms, and state laws are inade\u00ad quate to stop 'or cope with this aspect of the problem. Thus, a strong Federal firearms control act is very necessary. Mr. President, if crimes committed with the use of firearms are tO be mini\u00ad mized or reduced, their easy and imme\u00ad <iiate availability to persons convicted of crilnes of violence and narcotics viola\u00ad tions, persons mentallY incompetent or unstable, and others who might misuse them, should be tightly controlled. The data submitted by Honolulu's chief of police represent the most persuasive kind of arguments for a very strict Fed\u00aderal firearms control law. I believe that Senate bill 1, which I have cosponsored, can be such a law. And I feel strongly that its enactment is long overdue. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the data submitted by Chief Liu, entitled \"Information on Sources of Firearms Used in the Commission of C~es,\" be printed at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the state\u00ad ment was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: Information on sources of firearms used in the commission of crimes, 1965 Crime categories Total actual cases Number of cases firearms used Breakdown of1965 firearms cases--Continued Handgun, 1llegally purchased from lo-cal unknown person ______________ _ Handgun, illegally purchased and be\u00ad lieved to be from local underworld __ Rifie, stolen locallY-----------------\u00ad Handgun, brought into State, firearm legally acquired in another State when residence changed __________ _ Handgun, accused and origin of hand\u00ad gun unknown--------------------- Total cases ____ .: _______________ .

NSA recognized the Vital im\u00ad portance of American student participation 5 in international student affairs which other\u00ad wise would have been dominated by the well trained and well informed representatives of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. But our's was no reflex Cold War action. Indeed it was precisely out of NSA's dissent from many aspects of American post war foreign policy which often seemed to us intransigent and inflexible that many of the Association's international programs were born. 1 8 2 2 2 NSA believed that there was a critical need 6 4 Total cases---------------------- 51 for the American student movement to be an active participant in world affairs in or\u00ad der to create a more sensible international atmosphere.

Three aspects of NSA's international poli\u00ad cies should be emphasized: ... NSA consistently supported and sought to strengthen democratic student organiza\u00ad tions in those countries where they existed and encouraged their formation where they did not exist. 'Tile political and social im\u00ad portance of students and student organiza\u00ad tions was not then widely recognized, but it was evident to us that students were a st'g\u00ad nlfl.cant and influential elite in their coun\u00ad tries. NSA's international policy early recognized the crucial importance which nationalist February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE 4689 movements in Asia, Africa and Latin Amer\u00ad ica would have in shaping our world. NSA's attitude was consistently but not uncriti\u00ad cally sympathic to nationalist aspirations. Others were equally aware of those aspira\u00ad tions, but at that time much U.S. foreign policy was still focused upon Europe and the Soviet Union. There were few institutions through which individuals who felt the ur\u00ad gency of American cooperation with na\u00ad tionalist groups could act. NSA was one such institution. While we were quite aware of the expan\u00ad sionist ambitions and ideological goals of the Soviet Union, NSA chose to deal with the Soviets and Eastern Europeans not as ideo\u00ad logical pariahs but as political adversaries in a changing world. We felt that the politt.cs of confrontation would not only hinder Soviet domination of international student life, 'but would also enable young Soviets and Eastern Europeans to come into contact with the ideas and convictions of young Ameri\u00ad cans, and vice versa. Without substantial funds, NSA's interna\u00ad tional program would have been immobi\u00ad lized. Yet each of us concluded that, With\u00ad out question, we would have chosen im\u00ad mobilization if the only funds available were conditioned on impairment of the independ\u00ad ence of any of NSA's principles or programs. And so the question became whether CIA funds entailed any such conditions. We state categorically that they did not. Each of us after being elected to office was fully informed about the CIA relationship. Al\u00ad legations that we were \"trapped\" or \"duped\" are arrant nonsense. While we constantly searched for alternative sources of funds, this relationship was the only realistic and responsible alternative available to us at that time. Each of us authorized its continu\u00ad ation subject to the controls and safeguards which we each deemed necessary to ensure the complete independence and integrity of NSA. One such safeguard was to insist that senior elected officers in succeeding years be informed of the relationship so that no pos\u00ad sib111ty could exist of by-passing the duly elected leadership of the Association, which could reappraise the relationship annually. Each of us maintained the utmost vigilance and independence of judgment during his term of office. Attempts at control would not have been tolerated. Any such attempts would have resulted in an immediate termi\u00ad nation of the relationship. The absence of controls should be abso\u00ad lutely clear to anyone who is either fam111ar with NSA or willing to take the time tore\u00ad view the record. Each NSA policy and pro\u00ad gram was adopted by the governing bodies of the Association, the National Student Congresses. For nearly twenty years NSA has remained constant to the principles it established in the late 1940's long before any financial discussion with the government took place. These policies and programs have been consistently independent of and often in conflict with the positions of the government. NSA friends and foes alike have verified this fact throughout NSA's history. Political contexts change. The national and international situation in which NSA creates its present policies is no longer the one in which we made our decisions. We have aiways recognized the responsibility of each group of current leaders of NSA to lead the organization in the direction which seems to them appropriate during their term of office, subject to the decisions of the governing bodies of the Association. In retrospect we feel that in the world in which we worked the relationship helped make it possible for the American student \u00b7movement to make important contributions toward the development of democratic stu\u00ad dent organizations. We affirm our sense of pride in the free and independent accom\u00ad plishments of NSA during those years. We reaffirm our conviction that all those in\u00ad dividuals who shared in carrying out NSA's international activities did so with honor in the best traditions of American voluntary service.

Mr. President, the pro\u00ad posed new legislation calling for a na\u00ad tional program in occupational health could not be more timely or more needed. New processes and new sources of energy are presenting health hazards of un\u00ad precedented complexity. A new and po\u00ad tentially toxic chemical is introduced into industry approximately every 20 min- utes. \u00b7 Some of the needed corrective meas\u00ad ures are very simple, if they are applied. A well engineered and correctly placed ventilating fan will do wonders in pro\u00ad tecting the health of a worker or work\u00ad ers. On the other hand, there are other problems that can be solved only through intensive, long-term basic and expe_ri\u00ad mental research. Asbestos-caused health problems pre\u00ad sent a case in point. A recent report indicates that exposure to high levels of asbestos dust occurring 20 to 30 years ago is probably responsible for a 21- percent increase in the death rate among certain workers. Such association, how\u00ad ever, is not controlled enough to give the answers that are needed in order to protect industrial workers. We do not know, for example, whether the asbestos mineral fibers are vehicles or carriers of carcinogenic chemicals or if they are active themselves. Nor do we know that it might not be the degree of hydration in the asbestos silicates or the physical properties of lts fibrous structure that caused problems. A similar problem exists 1n the case of the soft coal worker's chest disease. We do know that 10 percent of the active miners and 20 percent of the former miners in the soft coal regions of Appa\u00ad lachia have a serious, disabling chest disease. We do not know, however, whether the coal dust itself is to blame or whether some of its constituents, such as aluminum, copper, titanium, or boron, are causing our serious occupational health problems. Several months ago, another health problem arose which has caused several known deaths and a serious degree of dis\u00ad covered illness. I say \"discovered\" be\u00ad cause only recently have some physicians learned that certain persons who use metal solder containing cadmium are exposing themselves to highly toxic fumes. Vague warnings on packages of cadmium-containing sol'der are insuffi\u00ad cient. In industries where there is heavy use of this material, no warnings at all are provided to the user. Further complicating the picture in these and other occupational disease problems is the long time that it takes for these diseases to occur even with exposure to low levels of toxic materials. The disease seen today among asbestos workers and coal miners, for example, is associated with exposure to high levels of dust 20 to 30 years ago. Dust levels today are generally much lower, so the problems of the future may again be different. The only way we are going to get the answers to complicated questions involv\u00ad ing industrial health is through ex\u00ad panded research. The answers cannot wait 20 to 30 years, because it will be too\u00b7 late to protect today's workers then. That is why there must be greater em\u00ad phasis on experimental research. We must be armed with better scientific in\u00ad formation upon which we can base pre\u00ad ventive measures. Asbestos and soft coal and cadmium are very important to our Nation's economy. They cannot be cast aside merely because of associated health prob\u00ad lems. These natural materials can be used without extreme hazard if we apply existing knowledge and, at the same time, press forward with an expanded research program which will develop a broader approach to our total industrial health problem. The legislation proposed today will help accomplish these objectives. BURIALS AT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Feb\u00ad ruary 25 issue of the Journal of the Armed Forces contains an article by Edi\u00ad tor Louis Stockstill which fairly well sums up my views on the new rules for burials at Arlington National Cemetery recently \u00b7 announced by the Department of the Army. Mr. Stockstill suggests that the Con\u00ad gress must devise suitable solutions for the mounting problem posed by the shortage of burial space for servicemen. veterans and their dependents 1n our national cemeteries. If there are no objections, I ask that Mr. Stockstill's article be printed in the RECORD in its entirety. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: BURIALS AT ARLINGTON (By Louis Stocksttll) The new Army rules for burials at Arling\u00ad ton National Cemetery no doubt constitute an honest effort to solve a difficult problem. Yet the solution is far from satisfactory. The main argument for limiting future burials to active and retired members of the Armed Forces, Medal of Honor winners, and Government VIP veterans (The Journal, 18 Feb.), is that at the current burial rate all of the space at Arltngton will rapidly disappear. Plans are underway to expand the ceme\u00ad tery, but this expansion, even when coupled with the new rules, will not prevent all of the space from ultimately becoming ex\u00ad hausted. And it's likely that all of those now on active duty or on the retired rolls will have to be buried elsewhere if they are still living 20 years from now. So, as far as we are concerned, there 1s little merit in simply postponing the in\u00ad evitable by closing the gates to \"Selected\" veterans. Present or former Presidents, Vice Presi\u00ad dents, Cabinet officers, Supreme Court Jus\u00ad tices, Congressmen, Senators, and a flock of 4690 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -J SENATE February 28, 1967 Presidential appointees still would be eligible for Arlington burial, provided they are quali\u00ad fied veterans. Frankly, we see no reason to permit some obscure, one-term Congressman or short\u00ad term sub-Cabinet official-who spent a mini\u00ad mum amount of time in uniform-to be buried in Arlington, when many, more dis\u00ad tinguished veterans would be barred. The :p.ew rules, as they apply to veterans, can only be an ali-or-nothing proposition. The weakness of the Army plan is under\u00ad lined by the creation of an \"excepted\" group --a move which could easily be interpreted as an effort to make the plan more palata\u00ad ble to those who would be in a favored posi\u00ad tion to otherwise oppose it. Although our military readers consist al\u00ad most entirely of active and retired personnel, we cannot in an conscience (nor do we be\u00ad lieve they would want us to) ignore the fact that they have no more legal right to burial at Arlington than any other veteran. The Cemeteries initially were authorized as burial grounds for men killed in combat or dying of battle wounds during the Civil War. They were not established for all ac\u00ad tive duty personnel, or for retirees, or for veterans, or for high Government officials. Veterans first were authorized to be buried in the Cemeteries 10 years after the Civil War (The Journal, 22 March 1873). Their rights, therefore, are as firmly established in both statute and tradition as those of the combat dead. Over the years, eligib111ty for burial in the Cemeteries has been consist- ently broadened. \u00b7 If the rules must now be revised, then Congres&;-not the Army-should assume the responsib111ty for -making such revisions as are necessary and justified. Congress repre\u00ad sents the people. And, the people should have some voice in deciding the fate of our National Cemeteries, which, after an,\u00b7 were erected and are maintained and supported by the tax dollars of the entire population. As we see it, ;three different problems ~ust be solved. If it is considered desirable to have a na\u00ad tional burying ' ground for State Funerals of former, present and future top Government officials, it' is\u00b7 time we developed a new cemetery solely. for this purpose. And, if Arlington, the most famous and historic military cemetery in the Nation, is to be permanently closed during this cen\u00ad tury, as the Army intimates, then neither is it too early to start planning and develop\u00ad ing another Arlington-perhaps one specifi\u00ad cally set aside for our combat dead, for\u00b7our military heroes, for those in uniform who lay down their lives for their country in whatever endeavor. And, too, our other veterans cannot be ignored. Congress must devise some suita\u00ad ble solution for them. We think the most appropriate commen\u00ad tary on the entir~ problem might be one that was made several years ago in a related conte;x:t by the former Chairman Carl Vinson of the House Armed Services Committee. When the Army, in an economy move, sought to eliminate the traditional funeral horses at Arlington, Chairman Vinson pro\u00ad tested. His argument, simply stated, and equally valid today, was this: . \"If we can afford state dinners and the expenses always associated with the visits of foreign dignitaries, we can afford to retain some small semblance of the re,spect this Nation sttil possesses for the fEl:W military personnel who are carried to their last restr ing place on a caisson. \u00b7 DR. WOODLIEF THOMAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, \u00b7 COMMITTEE ON BANKING AND CURRENCY Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was sorry to learn yesterday that Dr. Wood\u00ad lief Thomas, who has been serVing as the chief economist on the staff of the Committee on Banking and Currency has found it necessary for personal rea\u00ad sons to terminate his services to the committee. Yesterday, in announcing this fact to the Senate, the senior Senator from Ala\u00ad bama [Mr. SPARKMAN] chairman of the committee, briefly outlined the high\u00ad lights of Dr. Thomas' impressive career. I feel that it is especially noteworthy that Dr. Thomas has served this country for 47 years. This record, equaled by only a very few, has covered a period in which we have experienced war and de\u00ad pression as well as relative peace and un\u00ad excelled prosperity. Perhaps even more impressive to me than the period which he has served is that this service has not been as a partisan but as a public servant in the best sense of that term. Dr. Thomas' long experience and edu\u00ad cational background provided a store\u00ad house of knowledge and technical ability from which the members of the Banking and Currency Committee have been able to draw on a moment;s notice. , This has proved especially helpful in the areas of monetary policy and international finance. . Even more important, however, from my point of view is the fact that Dr. Thomas has served all members of the committee with equal diligence. I ha:ve . appreciated my association with hiin and the frankness and candor of his comments when I have asked him for his assistance and opinions. I can only wish him well and assure him that he can leave satisfied that his services have been appreci-ated by those with whom he has served, and that he has made an important contribution to the committee and his country. This, indeed, is success. \u00b7 CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO ORGANIZATIONS BY CIA Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota. Mr. President, practically every newspaper and magazine has recently published ar\u00ad ticles and many editorials dealing with the CIA. One of the best editorials I have read during the recent controversy concerning the contributions the CIA has made to various organizations was one published in the Grand Forks Herald, Grand Forks, N. Dak. ~ I ask unanimous \u00b7consent that the editorial be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, .the editorial was ordered to be 'printed in the' RECORD, as follows: \u00b7 SPY STORY There's something embarrassing to most Americans about the idea that we have spies and a sophisticated espionage set-up. When we think about it, of course, we recognize the need for intell1gence. But we'd rather not think about the details anq, if we do, we'd just as soon imagine a dashing young adventurer in a trench coat who outwits brutal enemy agents. \u00b7Spies are all right in a thriller or on television, but not in our conscience. Thus the super-spy agency of the Vnited States, the Central Intelligence Agency, gets it coming and going. If we are taken by sur\u00ad prise by rockets in Cuba or underground ac\u00ad tivity in southeast Asia, we blame the CIA for not doing its job. If the CIA uses Ameri-can citizens who have logical reasons for be\u00ad ing abroad, as part of their intelligence net\u00ad work, we react in horror. They've bungled again. There are two sides to the most recent CIA sensation. On the one hand, it appears that the CIA has tainted the National Student Association by contributing money to its overseas pro\u00ad gram. On the other hand, it can be said that the United States was losing in the international student forums because the Soviet Union was organizing and propagandizing the world student movement. Through CIA financial contributions it became possible to have the American viewpoint presented at interna\u00ad tional gatherings, supporters of the intelli\u00ad gence agency say. And what's so wrong with that? Whichever side is right--if either is en\u00ad tirely-it's likely that the CIA w111 continue to be the United States' eyes and ears around the world. And w111 continue, from time to time, to be the center of news sensations which shock some Americans. After all, we're like that. We like every\u00ad body to wear white hats. HOME RULE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, President Johnson's message on the District of Co\u00ad lumbia is a call for action which should appeal to the conscience and better judg\u00ad ment of each member of the 90th Con\u00ad gress. The President has asked us to do something which should have been done long ago; namely, to authorize self\u00ad goverrunent for the residents of the Dis\u00ad trict of Columbia. I sincerely en,dorse the President's proposal and hope that the 90th Con\u00ad gress will reach agreement quickly on home rule legislation for the District. The President has warned that time is running out; the District faces serious problems that must be' solved by the people\u00b7 themselves acting through 'their own elected leaders. Without self-gov\u00ad ernment there can be no real progress or leadership for this community, and the people will remain submerged in a morass of conflicting authority and com\u00ad mitment. Without self-government re\u00ad dress of grievances by the citizens of this Federal city will be difficult to achieve. There is no longer any rational excuse for delaying adoption of this vitally im\u00ad portant proposal. Agreement on home rule for the District must be accom\u00ad plished during this session of Congress '. The President is right: time is running out in the affairs of the District. Con\u00ad gress should respond now to the just de\u00ad mands of American citizens who have never known\u00b7 representative government in the Capital of the greatest representa\u00ad tive government on earth. THE VOICE OF AMERICA Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, Friday, February 24, 1967, marked the 25th an\u00ad niversary of the Voice of America, the broadcast arm of the U.S. Information Agency. On Thursday, February 23, Mr.' Leonard H. Marks, Director of the U.S. Information Agency, addressed the Na\u00ad tional Press Club in Washington, D.C., on \"International Communication: A National Imperative.\" In his speech Mr. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4691 Marks dramatically reviewed geographic, political, and communication revolutions which have taken place during the past quarter century and the tasks now facing the U.S. Information Agency. Ai3 Mr. Marks points out, the role of USIA in the field of \"public diplomacy\" is a vital one. I commend these thought\u00ad ful remarks to the consideration of the Senate and ask unanimous consent that they be printed at this point in the RECORD. It is fitting that we join in saluting the Voice of America, its Di\u00ad rector, John W. Chancellor, and the Director of its parent organization, the U.S. Information Agency, on the occa\u00ad sion of the 25th anniversary of this vital branch of the U.S. Government. There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION: A NATIONAL IMPERATIVE (An address by Leonard H. Marks, Director, U.S. Information Agency, National Press Club, Washington, D.C., February 23, 1187) Mr. LeRoy, members of the National Press Club, fellow guests: Tomorrow the Voice of America, the radio arm of the U.S. Information Agency, cele\u00ad brates its twenty-fifth anniversary. Such an occasion is by tradition a moment for \"!tock\u00ad taklng. Today I ask you to join me in re\u00ad flecting on some of the dramatic changes that have taken place in international com\u00ad munication within the last quarter century\u00ad a period that I suspect does not seem very rong to most of us in this room-and to consider some of the implications of these changes for the United States. When I came to Washington in 1942, there were 698 radio stations in the United States. Television was in its experimental stage and satellites existed only in the minds of 8ome daring fiction writers. The chief means of international communication were telephone and telegraph-dependent on uncertain equipment and the vagaries of the weather, to say nothing of the temperament of Morse Code operatore. To cite only the most obvious changes, today in the United States alone there are over 6,000 radio stations and more than 700 television channels .. International broad\u00ad casting has become such a; common business that the International Telecommunicatiorus Union faces a crisis for want of enough fre\u00ad quencies to meet the burgeoning demand. Two weeks ago in London, Chairman Kosy\u00ad gin held the first press conference to be telecast simultaneously via satellite on both sides of the Atlantic. Just in the past week we have been seeing, on the evening tele\u00ad vision news, events of the same day in Vietnam. In only a few years, our whole pattern of communication has been transformed. This transformation is part of a broader picture of profound changes that have marked the past twenty-five years-changes s0 sweeping that they merit being called revolutions. They have been so much a part of our lives that we sometimes take them for granted. Thus I hope you w111 not think I am belaboring the obvious when I recall three that are fundamental to what we are discussing today. The first I shall call the geographic revolu\u00ad tion. By this I mean the remarkable expan\u00ad sion of the geograpl:_lic boundaries of our national \u00b7concerns. Before Pearl Harbor, America was deeply divided over whether her own safety would be menaced by a Hitlerian Europe. Today through our commitment to the NATO nations, we have declared that an attack upon them would be considered an attack upon ourselves. Few parts' of the globe are now remote to us; there are few whose peoples' hopes and fears, triumphs and setbacks, do not in some way affect the United States. Take the specters of famine and over\u00ad population. These twin menaces do not threaten the people of the United States directly, yet we know that if they threaten others, however many thousands of miles away, our own security and well-being are ultimately involved. , Americans have traditionally shown con\u00ad cern for their neighbors. The geographic rev\u00ad olution means that our neighbors today live in India, Brazil, Nigeria, and Turkey . . . in fact, around the globe. And Americans are there, working with them. Second is a political revolution, marked by the increasing power of public opinion on governments throughout the world. While the citizen is most powerful in a democracy, even authoritarian governments must con\u00ad cern themselves with the minds and hearts of their people. Think for a moment of the fervor with which the leaders of the Cultural Revolution in China are impressing the thought of Mao upon the Chinese ma,sses through wall posters, pamphlets, books, news\u00ad paper, radio fl.nd television. In most of the world today the masses of people wield more power, have higher as\u00ad pirations, and are more aware of events out\u00ad side their immediate surroundings, than ever before. What the citizen thinks is of consequence not only to his own government but to other governments as well. Chairman Kosygin, I am sure valued the international audience he was able to rea:ch through his recent Lon\u00ad don press conference. Today ap the great powers, and many smaller ones too, seek to put their case before the court of world opin\u00ad ion. To be sure, the jury may not always be able to enforce the verdict, but its opinions are important. In the long run, they may be decisive. Third comes the communication revolu\u00ad tion, to which I have already referred. Let me add just a few more facts .. Five years ago, 64 nations had television; today the number is 104. In the same period, the num\u00ad ber of sets around the world rose from 101 million to 182 mlllion. Radio receivers, thanks to the low-cost transistor, have in\u00ad creased from 356 million to 543 mlllion. In\u00ad ternational broadcasting has jumped from 16 thousand to 24 thousand hours weekly. For this audience I need not elaborate the point that news today Is both international and instantaneous. Statesmen can no longer with impunity make one statement for the \"domestic\" and another for the \"interna tional\" audience. You newsmen have made that next to impossible. And as most Amer\u00ad icans who travel abroad have observed, re\u00ad ports of a race riot in a northern U.S. city or the use of police dogs in a southern town will be heard over transistor radios and seen in banner headlines and radiophotos around the world. In an open society, domestic problems cannot be solved in family privacy. For better or for worse they are shared with the world. These three revolutions-in geography, in politics and in communication-are quite evidently inter-related. And the three in concert present the United States with new problems, opportunities and responsiblllties. First the responsib111ties. The United States' role of leadership today-in context of the three revolutions that I have de\u00ad scribed-makes direct communication with other peoples an .imperative. We need to be understood and respected, able to state our case cogently and to persuade, not just in chanceries around the globe, but also in the court of public opinion. We must be able to communicate effec\u00ad tively with other peoples on the many issues on which our mutual. welfare and security depend in a tense and potentially explosive world. Thus direct communication, or \"public diplomacy,\" has become an essential element in the conduct of the foreign relations of the United States. This is the task of the U.S. Information Agency. It is a necessary task and a natural one for a nation which, in its Declaration of Independence, proclaimed the need for a \"decent respect to the opinions of mankind.\" USIA of course does not and should not have sole responsibility for such communi\u00ad cation. Private channels form by far the greatest part of the international dialogue. The news agencies, Hollywood films, the businessman, tourist, and GI all participate. It is the role' of USIA to complement the myriad private channels where the interests of the United States so dictate: to supply significant facts that are not known, to put into perspective and balance those that are, to fill significant gaps. Thus USIA first asks, \"What needs to be done, in the interests of the United States, that is not being done in other ways?\" The needs and opportunities are very great. Thanks to the excellence of American en\u00ad gineering, the Voice of America can be heard in the deserts of Africa, the steppes of Rus\u00ad sia, the villages of the Andes. Fifteen mil\u00ad lion watts Of power beam our message over more than 100 transmitters. With con\u00ad struction planned and tinderway, our signals will reach all parts of the globe with even greater strength and clarity. The expansion of television, radio and motion picture chan\u00ad nels in the developing nations offers us new and wider outlets. Hunger for knowledge about the rest of the world, which characterizes so much of youth\u00b7 everywhere today, is stlll another as\u00ad set. Young people want to hear what we, as well as others, h.,ave to say. At the same. time, the problems are mani\u00ad folci. Simply because communication is technically more feasible than ever before does not mean that it is easier. Inter\u00ad cultural communica~ion is a difficult and delicate process. The possibillties of mis\u00ad understanding and misinterpretation are rife. Words that mean one thing to us may mean something very different to others. Some of our research studies, 'for example, show that a phrase like \"capitalism\" ..has a negative connotation to leaders in many countries. Yet, when our economic system is explained to these same persons as a com\u00ad bination of private initiative and govern\u00ad ment regulation, many wholeheartedly ap\u00ad prove it. They discover that we have what they seek. . So we must choose our .words with care. Or take another example of the difficulties. With the more highly educated and sophis\u00ad ticated audiences-particularly with leader\u00ad ship elements influ\u00ad ence in shaping jmblic opinion-the very din of voices and multiplicity of communi\u00ad cation may create .problems. \u00b7Competition for attention ' is keen. Audiences become mar& selective and more critical in their judgment. The challenge to skill \u00b7in pres\u00ad entation is proportionate. That the United States makes news in so many different ways is still another factor. It is often the sensational, the brutal, the unusual that claim the headlines. People around the world know more about the United States today than they did a genera\u00ad t~on ago. But they often do not know the most significant--how the ordinary family lives, what the ordinary worker does, what the ordinary law-abiding citizen thinks-be\u00ad cause these dally happenings do not make the headlines. Nor are they facts which Moscow, Peking or others who disagree with us, will tell. \u00b7 I can touch today only on some of the highlights of how USIA goes about meeting these challenges. Because we are honoring the Voice of America on its anniversary, I shall mustrate chiefly in terms of VOA. I 4692 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 ask you to keep in mind, however, that USIA programs encompass the various media of communication-films, television, press, pub\u00ad lications, books, libraries, exhibits, personal contact--and that our overseas oftlces, known as USIS, also administer the cultural exchange programs of the Department of State. First I would point out that one funda\u00ad mental principle guides our operations: USIA aims to tell the truth with pro~essional skill. In the inaugural broadcast of the Voice of America twenty-five years ago, in the dark days of early 1942, the announcer said: \"Daily at this time we shall speak to you about America and the war. The news may be gOOd or bad. We shall tell you the truth.\" That maxim still guides USIA today. It has stOOd us in good stead. Sometimes--! shall speak frankly-! get queries from members of Congress and other influential Americans about some episode in the United States of which we are not par\u00ad ticularly proud; they ask whether we re\u00ad ported this on the Voice of America. I! it was significant news, we did. I submit that any other policy, in an open society, would be self-defeating. I also submit that the total impact of what we report--the reality about America and its policies-brings us not only credibility but also respect. In the end, the United States is judged by this reality, not by a rosy-hued interpretation of it. USIA's task is to present the facts fair\u00ad ly, accurately and persuasively, so that our world-wide audiences can make an informed judgment. One distinguished member of your frater\u00ad nity, James Reston of the New York Times, last August wrote a column after vacationing in Canada, where he had listened regularly to our broadcasts. VOA, he wrote, \". . . is not peddling political propaganda. It is telling not only what the President and his associates says, but what the opposition says. It is carrying the critical comments of the American press, and the protest of the American Negroes out of Chicago, and the accounts of crime in the cities, as well as the stories of American universities, novelists and poets .... \"What comes out of all this is not that the United States is failing so often, but that it is attempting so much; not that it has failed to eliminate poverty or create a Great Society, but that it is aiming at these high ideals .... \" \u00b7 Let me give you one recent example of how we reported some unpalatable news. When King Faisal was the guest of the United States, an unhappy incident, as you may recall, resulted in cancellation of a din\u00ad ner planned for him by the city of New York. The news broke a few minutes before our scheduled Arabic newscast to the Middle East. The Voice of America was the first to carry it to Saudi Arabia. Unpalatable and embarrassing, yes. But USIA gained credi\u00ad b111ty and confidence. You might be interested to kilow that a Director of the news agency TASS recently complained to the Congress of Soviet Jour\u00ad nalists that the Soviet Union did not follow such a policy. Referring to a plane crash at the Moscow airport, he claimed it would have been far better for Russians to learn the bad news from Radio Moscow than from the Voice of America. The U.S. space program is open for all to observe. We mourn the death of the three brave astronauts-we do not hide it. While we report America's setbacks, we also pro\u00ad claim with pride its successes. We tell of how President Johnson has fought for civil rights legislation which COngress has ap\u00ad proved-and strives for more. We tell of how American workers receive social security benefits, protection for old age, medical in\u00ad surance; of how America is trying to rebuild cities, eradicate slums, beautify the land. America is not a perfect society, but it strives for perfection. This we proudly tell. I should like to speak for a moment of USIA's role as oftlcial spokesman for the United States with foreign audiences. Here we have a grave responsibility to make cer\u00ad tain that U.S. policy is clearly understood. Let me first state that USIA does not make policy, foreign or domestic. We seek to ex\u00ad plain it. The Agency also has, within the Executive Branch, the responsibUity of ad\u00ad vising on the implications of foreign opinion for the conduct of our foreign relations. Obviously foreign opini9n is only one factor that must be taken into account as policy is formulated, and it cannot often be the de\u00ad termining one. It is our task, however, to see that it is considered. Throughout the world people see evidence of our prowess in space; they should also know of our determination to use it in the interests of peace. They hear and read much about U.S. military might; we seek to make them understand that it serves as a deter\u00ad rent against possible aggressors and atomic holocaust. They know full well that the United States is fighting in Vietnam-over 400 representatives of the world press, radio and television make this the most fully-cov\u00ad ered war in history-but they also should know that the United. States is there to sup\u00ad port the principle of self-determination. We hope, of course, that a clear explana\u00ad tion of the motivations of U.S. actions will bring conviction as well as understanding. We believe that U.S. policies will, in the long run, stand on their intrinsic worth, once they are adequately explained. -We recog\u00ad nize that others will not always agree with us. But we seek to make our policies crystal clear, if possible to win support, and at the least to prevent a misunderstanding of U.S. intentions that could prove disastrous. No great power today can afford to do less. At a time when misunderstanding \u00b7can re\u00ad sult in a nuclear catastrophe, we must never relax our efforts to inform the world of where we stand and the principles which we sup\u00ad port. The Voice of America is one of our strongest instruments for doing so. In 1942 it proclaimed, \"We shall tell you the truth.\" . Its message today is the same\u00ad may it always be. I have spoken chiefly of how we repor\u00b7t the news and how we explain U.S. policies. These are perhaps the most dramatic parts of our work, but no more significant than the quiet, continuing task that we perform day by day in 220 USIS posts around the world: build\u00ad ing understanding of the United States as a nation-its aims and ideals, i-ts institutions, society and culture. The judgments that other peoples have of the United States as a world leader and par\u00b7tner stem from their judgment of the kind of nation we are. Their view of what we have achieved and are seeking to achieve for ourselves inevitably colors their interpretation of U. S. actions and intentions throughout the world. rflrmly believe that as other peoples un\u00ad derstand the spirit of America, they will understand far better the policies than flow from it. And I believe they will have con\u00ad fidence in us. We seek to convey this spirit through fea\u00ad tures on our radio programs; through maga\u00ad zines such as America for the Soviet Union and Poland, Topic for Africa, and Al-Hayat for the Arabic speaking nations; through television programs and films that not only give an honest picture of the kind of nation we are, but also help to build a sympathetic bond between the American people and our overseas audiences. Here none of the USIA media contributes more than our USIS libra:rtes and reading rooms-227 of them in 84 countries. They are miniature storehouses of .knowledge about the United States, with representative works of our literature, history, science and other facets of our society. They stand as symbols of the cultural heritage of the United States and of our desire to share that heritage with others. I have sketched for you briefly what USIA seeks to. accomplish through direct com\u00ad munication with other peoples. Are we succeeding? I am convinced that we are. First, we know that we are getting through. Since communication requires a dialogue, our ears are tuned to what our audiences have to say. Each day between 500 and 1,000 letters and post-cards arrive at the Voice of America mail room. They come from all parts of the world including com\u00ad munist countries. They tell us what pro\u00ad grams our listeners prefer, what they like best and leas\u00b7t. Those of you ~ho are now experiencing the feeling that follows a full lunch may sym\u00ad pathize with the Filipino who asked that we change the time of our broadcast in Special English, which he heard after mid\u00ad night. He wrote, and I quote: \" ... we have to force o.urselves not to fall asleep because the program is so educational and enlighten\u00ad ing that ignoring it and falling asleep be\u00ad comes equally painful.\" You may have noticed an article in the New York Times Magazine two weeks ago by the distinguished British historian, H. R. Trevor-Roper. Reporting on his trip to Communist China in 1965, he told how he learned of the failure of the attempted communist coup in Indonesia over the Voice of America, audible throl,lgh the jamming. We do not, of course, know as much about our listening audience as we would like. We have studies under way to learn more. We do know that our listeners are predominantly young, alert, curious about the world and on the move. We know that they include distinguished statesmen, scientists and men of letters as well as university students who are rock-and-rollers. Among them are both staunch admirers of the United States, and those who distrust and oppose us. (As examples I cite a Central Amer~can President who regularly sends his country's native coffee to the announcer of VOA's Breakfast Show-and Communist China'.s Foreign Min\u00ad ll.ster Chen Yi who last September told a group of Japanese Parliamentarians that he listens daily to VOA.) I am glad that we reach both, for USIA should seek to reinforce its friends as well .as to influence its critics. Almost daily I hear some new evidence of the strength of the ties that USIA is forging through its world-wide network of commu\u00ad nication. Recent~y a U.S. Ambassador, just returned from his post in Africa, told us of an oftlcial call he made on the Chief of State. The gentleman suddenly looked at his watch and interrupted their conversation, saying, \"Ex\u00ad cuse me--it is 3:30, time to hear the news on the Voice of. America.'' An American in Moscow a few months ago took part in a discussion with three Soviet writers. A question of fact arose which was quickly settled when one of the Russians exclaimed, \"But I heard it last night on the Voice of America!\" The other two accepted the point without further question. We know that our ability to communicate with the young generation in the Soviet Union causes considerable worry to their political leaders. This year a new Soviet weekly was launched, RT (Radio and Tele\u00ad vision). It is devoted in part to attacking the \"nefarious pursuits\" of the U.S. Infor\u00ad tnation Agency. So recently-published book entitled \"Operation The Psy\u00ad chological Warfare of the American Impe\u00ad rialists.\" I can only interpret such attention to mean that we are indeed having an effect. In these few minutes I have shared some thoughts with you about three great revo\u00ad lutions-in geography, politics and commu\u00ad nication-that have over the past twenty\u00ad five years transformed our world. If we accept these premises-and I venture February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4693 to say the facts are\u00b7 not easily contested\u00ad then we must accept the conclusion that international communication has become an imperative for the United States. We must also accept the resulting respon\u00ad sib111ties. By communicating clearly and cogently with peoples of the world, I believe the U.S. Information Agency is helping to meet the challenge. THE 25 MILLIONTH VOTE Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, this week the United States is honoring an impor\u00ad tant event in labor-management rela\u00ad tions. In little more than 31 years since the enactment of the Wagner Act, 25 million votes have been cast in National Labor Relations Board elections. In a speech delivered in Indianapolis last Thursday, February 23, Mr. Sam Zagoria, a member of the NLRB, reviewed the history of the election procedures authorized by Congress in 1935 for deter\u00ad mining union representation and collec\u00ad tive bargaining purposes. As Mr. Zago\u00ad ria pointed out, the first secret ballot election under the jurisdiction of the NLRB was held in Indiana in December shortly after the adoption of the Wagner Act. During the succeeding years nearly 4,000 similar elections have been held in the State of Indiana alone. From a small beginning NLRB elec\u00ad tions have become both widespread and frequent. Over a half million workers, with a participation rate of some 90 per\u00ad cent, cast votes in approximately 8,000 such elections each year. There can be no doubt that this democratic determi\u00ad nation of the will of workers through the ballot box has contributed much to im\u00ad proved labor-management relations. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that Mr. Zagoria's address be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE 25 MILLIONTH VOTE-A MILESTONE IN INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY (Remarks of Sam Zagoria, member, National Labor Relations Board, at the Indiana Labor-Management Relations Luncheon, Indianapolis, Ind., Feb. 23, 1967) We are gathered here to celebrate a mile\u00ad stone in industrial democracy-the casting of the 25 millionth vote in a National Labor Relations Board election. Next week in Washington labor and man\u00ad agement will join together in a unique dem\u00ad onstration of cooperation in honoring the 25 millionth voter as a symbol of the 200,000 secret ballot elections run by the Board. A young machinist from New Jersey who cast a ballot in the decision to have United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, . repre\u00ad sent his plant in collective bargaining with the Reynolds Metals Company will come to Washington with his family to meet leaders of labor, management and government gathered to mark the occasion. For many, secret ballot elections are thought to have had their beginnings in the founding of our own democracy, but, actu\u00ad ally, this ingenious technique for measur\u00ad ing individual decisions has much deeper roots in world history. Way back in the fifth century B.C., in Athens certain secret ballot decisions were made by the electorate by casting white or black balls of stone. This may be where the term black ball originated. Many other elections were determined by show of hands in public meetings, but in the second cen-tury B.C., in Rome laws were passed provid\u00ad ing for a secret ballot in order to offset the influence which pa.tricians exercised over the plebeians. I assume similar consider\u00ad ations were involved in the Congressional decision to make NLRB elections secret ballot ones, but I leave to you which were the pa\u00ad tricians-the employers or the union leaders, or both? In the United States, from its earliest days elections were decided by voice, hand or division. Another system was devised in colonial days, borrowing from the Indians, and used corn for \"aye\" and beans for \"nay.\" This does seem like a more practical method than black or white stones, for here the ballots could be safely digested after the election. Challenged ballots mildewing in the drawer awaiting a decision might create some smelly problems, though. The secret ballot as such was developed in Australia in 1856 to safeguard the integrity of individual choices. However, more than 50 years later, Will Rogers observed that \"more men have been elected between sun\u00ad down and sunrise than ever were elected be\u00ad tween sunrise and sundown.\" There was evidence to support the Okla\u00ad homan's comment. In Philadelphia, for example, a politician, annoyed by jibes that his ward was a \"low down\" one, reminded his audience that it was originally the In\u00ad dependence Hall ward. \"The fathers of American liberty voted down here once,\" he said with a grin, \"and they vote here yet.\" In St. Louis, history records the words of St. Louis leader who walked out of a polling place and called across the cordon of police to a group of men standing at the curb, \"Are there any more repeaters out here who want to vote again?\" But there was a certain ethic even about election rigging. In New York state, in Chatham, a politico said he voted the dead only as they would have voted if alive. In a Tammany Hall election, Richard Croker once was accused of voting for a candidate for constable 14 times in one election. The constable indignantly came to his defense with the actual facts, \"Richard Croker voted for me 17 times in one day.\" Lest anyone here from Philadelphia, St. Louis or New York state take offense, let me emphasize that these things happened a long time ago, and for you native Hoosiers, of course they never could have happened in Indiana at any time. The reason for this happy occasion is to mark an important moment in industrial history and to recognize the tremendous progress which has been made _in achieving peaceful labor-management relations. It was not always thus. In pre-NLRB days the history of America's industrial relations sometimes resembled a casualty list in a war. The names of the Haymarket riot in Chicago, the Homestead, Pa., steel conflict, the Pullman strike, the McNamara dynamiting in Los Angeles, the sitdown strikes in the auto industry, are splattered in labor history by the blood of workers, employers, soldiers and police. But then in 1935, Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York proposed enactment of the National Labor Relations Act to guaran\u00ad tee the right of employees to organize or join unions of their own choosing and to bargain collectively with their employers. The leg- . islation was passed by Congress and signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Act created the National Labor Relations Board and charged it with holding secret ballot elections to decide which union, if any, the employees wanted to represent them for bargaining PUrPOseS. The Act did not convert the industrial bat\u00ad tlefield to an afternoon tea party overnight. In 1937, while the NLRB was still getting underway, the Memorial Day Massacre oc\u00ad curred in the Little Steel strike with a toll of 10 marchers k1lled, 30 wounded. But then, \"one by one the companies agreed to abide by the results of NLRB elections. In September 1941, the four Little Steel com\u00ad panies sat down to bargain.\" Some may ask why recall the bloody days now that they are behind us, but it seems to me that it is necessary in order to adequately appreciate the progress we have made. Neither today's labor nor management would want to return to those days of jungle warfare. The first Board directed election was run by the regional oftice here in Indianapolis on December 12, 1935. It was held in Fort Wayne for the 960 workers of the Wayne Knitting Mills. A total of 933 turned out, with 516 voting for the American Federation of Hosiery Workers, Branch #2, AFL, and 401 for the Association of Employees for Representation of Employees Only of the Wayne Knitting Mills. Six months later a contract was signed and through the ensu\u00ad ing 31 years, the Hosiery Workers, I am told, has continued to hold contracts with the company for several of its plants in this part of the country. In Indiana, the Indianapolis regional oftice has held almost 4000 elections during the past 20 years giving almost half a million workers a chance to make a free choice on whether to be represented by a union or not, and if so, which one. Incidentally, the av\u00ad erage rate of participation in these secret ballot elections, in Indiana has been almost 90 percent-a figure which compares most favorably with the turnout in political elec\u00ad tions here. Today, throughout the country, NLRB elections are becoming commonplace, hardly noted in contemporary journals. The ballot box has replaced the bomb and the b1llyclub. In 1937 there were 2,728 strikes for organiz\u00ad ing purposes; in 1964 there were only 35. The election process has been broadly accept\u00ad ed by labor and management-currently, 4 out of 5 elections are conducted by agree\u00ad ment of the company and the union. In all, 25 million working men and women have exercised freedom of choice in collective bar\u00ad gaining elections. This number, I might point out, equals the total population of the states of Indiana, Dlinois and Ohio, and ap\u00ad proaches a third of the entire civ111an work force of the nation. In exercising their right to choose a union or not, working men and women are pro\u00ad tected against retaliation, discrimination, or other unfair conduct, whether by employers or unions. Elections have grown in number and voter participation. In its first year, 1935, the Board held 31 elections for 7,734 voters with an average 80 percent participa\u00ad tion rate. This year, the Board is holding about 8,000 elections for more than a half million voters with an average 90 percent participation rate. (As a measure of com\u00ad parison, in the last presidential election, only 62 percent of the eligibles voted.) This Board election record doesn't just happen. Board employees through the 31 years of setting up and running elections have gone to great lengths to make voting easy and simple in the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Notices of election, for example, have been translated into almost every language on the linguistic spectrum, ranging from Spanish, Italian, Polish, and German through Yugoslavian, Russian, Chinese, and Tagalog. The polling place is brought to the worker-voting booths and boxes have been set u'p in factories. ware\u00ad ho1,1ses, mills, and also aboard ship, in rail\u00ad road boxcars, stadiuins, movie studios, and, when necessa.ry, in a rented circus tent. \u00b7The report of the Board agents running the salmon cannery elections in the Aleu\u00ad tians in 1945 is instructive on how far our people go, literally, in bringing the precious right to vote to each worker-and how difti\u00ad cult it sometimes is. The agents left Seattle in July aboard the Baranoff, the first com\u00ad mercial transportation after the war was technically ended. Things were still uncer-4694 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 tain so the vessel proceeded with no radio or other communication, total blackouts at night and nightly boat drills. Arriving at the False Pass cannery, three men fanned out to various polling places some 200 miles up the coast toward Kodiak. There was no commercial transportation so the trio had to thumb its way on fishing boats out and back. There were some com\u00ad pensations, the report shows; an agent, as\u00ad sisted Aleut fisherman, caught a chicken halibut by handline, fried it in butter and consumed it enthusiastically witP, salt crackers and strong black coffee. The next day, however, he arose in the midst of a blizzard, but somehow managed to make it back after holding his election. \u00b7 Other agents on the cannery voting task force had to make their way in a single\u00ad engine pontoon plane, which had to try five times before lifting off the two-foot high waves. One man was sent to Taku and was due back the same evening, but failed to arrive until three days later for he was fogged in. Another was sent to Hidden Inlet, but on the way down the moss-covered plane ramp he slipped, fell and disappeared into the sea. He was fished out, reequipped and sent forth. He returned five hours later, mission completed, but still wet to the skin. Ah, these government men do lead an easy life! Naturally, the Board is proud of its three\u00ad decade election history. While its 2300 em\u00ad ployees make i't one of the smallest Federal agencies, our people, whether in the In\u00ad dianapolis region or any one of the other 30 regions, have striven hard to accord each working man and woman his precious right to vote. They are our \"E\" men, e for elec\u00ad tion-and excellence. A labor historian, reviewing the span of elections, has observed: \"Many elections through the years were conducted in large units, as in a textile plant of 12,000 employees in a southern mlll town, for many of whom this must have been their first experience of casting a vote in a pub\u00ad licly conducted election, or in a steel cor\u00ad poration's mllls where more than 116,000 voters were eligible in plants throughout the country, voting for a national union after a long company-union history; or in steam\u00ad ship companies where it took months before all the ships returning from far seas could be counted when they touched American ports ... \"Many smaller elections involved their special difficulties and their own elements of drama, as when lumberjacks voted in the woods, or Negro workers in a cotton-seed-oil mill dared community opposition to come out and vote for a union . . . overall, the elec\u00ad tions conducted by the Board were an ex\u00ad perience With the democratic process, meet\u00ad ing some of its difficulties as well as giving the lift of spirit that often comes to the participant in such undertakings.\" The Board's election process has drawn praise from both labor and management. It has become the peaceful, logical way to re\u00ad solve questions of representation. If the union Wins an election, there is a duty to bargain in good faith. If the union loses the election, there can be no further election for at least a year in the same unit. The Board is constantly striving to im\u00ad prove its administration of the election proc\u00ad ess. Last year, concerned about the difficul\u00ad ties involved in assuring worker voters of the opportunity to hear both sides of arguments on choosing or rejecting union representa\u00ad tion, it adopted a rule requiring furnishing of lists of workers and their addresses so they could receive information before the election from interested parties. Last month, the Board announced a three-point program to better inform workers of their right to vote and to warn unions and man\u00ad agements against conduct impeding fair and free elections. Representation elections have led to the give and take of the bargaining table and hundreds of thousands of contracts have been agreed upon by both parties. In the words of Archibald Cox, former Solicitor General of the United States, \"Par\u00ad ticipation in debate often produces changes in a seemingly fixed position either because new facts are brought to light or because the strengths and weaknesses of the several arguments become apparent. Sometimes the parties hit upon so;ne novel compromise of an issue which has been thrashed over and over. Much is gained even by giving each s.ide a better picture of the strength of the other's convictions.\" Industrial democracy has cleared the way for unprecedented industrial growth and has brought the workers improved pay, safer working conditions, and job security. In\u00ad dustrial peace has made possible bold and imaginative contract provisions for pensions, life insurance, apprenticeship programs, and adjustment to an accelerated technology. Multiemployer contracts, multiunion bar\u00ad gaining, pension clearinghouses, worker sab\u00ad baticals, and other tools for human relations have emerged from the mutual efforts in the bargaining room. The father of the National Labor Relations Act, Senator Wagner, described his blll as based on the principle \"that democracy cannot work unless it is honored in the factory as well as the polling booth; and that men cannot be truly free in body and in spirit unless their freedom extends into the places where they earn their dally bread.\" A principal author of the 1947 amend\u00ad ments, Senator Robert A. Taft, described them as \"based on the theory that the solu\u00ad tion of the labor problem in the United States is free collective bargaining-a con\u00ad tract between one employer and all of his men acting as one man ... No employer can beat down a union; no employer can discriminate; no employer can refuse to deal with the union which is duly certified to him.\" Our gathering here indicates that man is not inevitably committed to hostillty and dis\u00ad agreement. We accept the view that we have hands to shake hands with-as well as to tighten into fists; that we have ears to hear each other's -pleas-as well as each other's insults; that we have eyes to look at each other and recognize sincerity and un\u00ad derstanding. These things are possible when men of good will sit down bogether, reason With each other and search out areas of agreement. They are the basis of man's greatest inven\u00ad tion-not the technological ones which pour out an endless stream of material goods-\u00ad but rather the development of the council table where differences are openly displayed and discussion moves to understanding and agreement. For above all, we have to con\u00ad stantly find ways to live together in peace and harmony. These principles hold as true in the volatile field of labor-management relationships as in the relationships between nations or be\u00ad tween states. The secret ballot election process, I submit, has been a useful first step along this route to discussion and understanding. One of democracy's grewtest exponents summed it up simply: \"At the bottom of all tributes paid to democracy is the little man, walking into the little booth, with a. little pencil, making a little cross on a little bit of paper-no amount of rhetoric or voluminous discussion can pos\u00ad sibly diminish the overwhelming importance of that point.\"-Winston Churchill. And now I am at the end of my 25 mil\u00ad lionth voter birthday greeting and I feel much as H. L. Mencken, the Baltimore writer, felt on completion of a new volume. \"I feel like the mother of the Dionne quintu\u00ad plets-that is to say, I am happy, but hollow.\" APPROPRIATIONS FOR MAJOR SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMS Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. President, at 11 o'clock this morning President John\u00ad son sent to Congress a request for ap\u00ad propriations for three major scientific programs. In his statement, the Presi\u00ad dent concluded: These projects are not theoretical adven\u00ad tures. They are the practical results of basic scientific research, and their fruits will prove of the highest value to a nation seeking new and peaceful keys to unlock the powers of man and the universe. At a time when Congress and the ex\u00ad ecutive branch are closely concerned about the level of Federal spending, I believe the President's comment is sig\u00ad nificant. He asks for these funds-and I support his request wholeheartedly-as an investment in the extension of man's knowledge and the application of that knowledge to human progress. The request for funds covers these projects: nuclear rocket propulsion; a medium-energy physics facility; and a specialized facility for advanced research on controlled thermonuclear fusion as a potential source of electricity. All of these projects involve the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, in New Mexico. The facilities for medium energy physics research-the so-called meson factory-and the controlled thermonuclear fusion installation will be established at Los Alamos. I know there is always the thought that a Member of Congress works to secure programs for the benefit of his own State. This ac\u00ad tivity has been criticized as the \"scien\u00ad tific pork barrel.\" But while the nu\u00ad clear-rocket project has much of its re\u00ad search base in New Mexico, and while the meson factory and the controlled thermonuclear facility would be sited at Los Alamos, the entire Nation is the beneficiary. These are not provincial projects. This morning, in hearings, the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy heard tes\u00ad timony from some of the scientists chiefly responsible for the meson facility and controlled thermonuclear progress. Dr. Louis Rosen, a guiding spirit in the medium energy physics program, pointed out that the meson facility will be available at least 50 percent of the time to researchers from outside the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. They will come from across the Nation, and, indeed, the facility will be the \"focus of worldwide activity in medium energy physics,\" Dr. Rosen said. The device will be used for studying the basic struc\u00ad ture of the atomic nucleus and the forces that govern that nucleus. Moreover, the meson facility holds the promise of being a valuable instrument for the treatment of certain forms of cancer. I hesitate to put the wrong em\u00ad phasis on this possibility; I do not want to label this instrument the means for curing cancer. But Dr. Rosen pointed out to the Joint Committee a few hours ago that in the last year or two the pos\u00ad sibilities of the meson facillty offered a method for attacking deep-seated, in\u00ad operable malignancies. Mr. President, I have long been en\u00ad thusiastic about the application of nu-February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4695. clear propulsion to space travel. The nuclear rocket offers far greater efficiency than chemical propulsion, and that means cost savings. Quite clearly, the exploration of space is in its early and formative years. We shall continue this bold journey, and the atom will be absolutely essential to suc\u00ad cess. That is why I strongly endorse the President's decision to move toward the development of a nuclear rocket engine for actual space flight. I ask unanimous consent that a state\u00ad ment I made earlier today regarding the President's announcement be printed in the RECORD. -There being no objection, the state\u00ad ment was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: The President's decision on the three nu\u00ad . clear projects is of t_remendous impact. While I am, of course, proud of the involve\u00ad ment of the Los Alamos scientific laboratory, the significance goes far beyond New Mexico. First, the decision to begin development of a nuclear rocket engine for flight brings closer to reality the use of atomic energy for \u00b7space travel with far more emcient en\u00ad gines for long space voyages. The nerva en\u00ad gine that is to be developed could be used in a nuclear rocket stage to replace the chemical third stage of the Saturn V vehicle. This would increase the payload capability of that vehicle by 65 to 85 percent for lunar exploration and lunar base operations, and by about 100 percent for unmanned deep space scientific missions to the planets or close in to .the sun. Such use of nerva to increase the payloads of Saturn V could be particularly important if the SoViet Union demonstrated a payload capabil1ty larger than that of Saturn V. In addition, that same nerva engine, when installed in a suit\u00ad able space rocket system, would permit manned exploration of the planets with space craft that were millions of pounds lighter in earth orbit than with chemical propulsion. Although the estimate of additional cost for development of the nerva engine is a total of about $1 billion over a ten year pe\u00ad riod, I am told this total cost could be paid off in only a few space missions because of the high performance achievable with nu\u00ad clear propulsion, as compared with any con\u00ad ceivable alternate chemical system. Any nation which is s.eriously planning for even\u00ad tual leadership in space must plan on using nuclear power. Second, the decision to begin construction of the linear proton accelerator for the pro\u00ad duction of mesons at Los Alamos is of most immediate impact to the laboratory. Es\u00ad tablishment of this facility assures the long\u00ad term usefulness of the laboratory and its staff. It tells the people of Los Alamos that their community is going to continue to be a viable one. The total cost of this project-\u00ad $55 million-is a sound investment in scien\u00ad tific research. Not only will the meson fa\u00ad c1lity be important to national security, but there may be considerable promise that it wm play a major role in improving the health of our people, particularly in the treatment of cancer. The meson facility will be available to re\u00ad searchers not only in the Rocky Mountain region, but for scientists from far beyond as well. Third, I want to mention scyllac. This is the Los Alamos project which looks towards the harnessing of thermonuclear fusion to produce electric power. AEC-sponsored scientists have made ex\u00ad cellent progress in controlled thermonuclear research. Intensive review has led to the conclusion that the time is now ripe for ex~ panded effort in this field. There is broad support in the scientific community for e~\u00ad panding the effort at Los Alamos. QUite ob\u00ad viously, the payoff is down the road, but there is a strong conviction that there will be rewards in terms of assuring mankind vast amounts of very low cost energy. Mr. BIBLE. Mr. President, in asking today for additional appropriations for nuclear rocket engine development, President Johnson has taken a historic step that will truly join the nuclear age with the space age. As one who has championed our Nation's efforts in this field, I wish to commend the President for his far-sighted judgment and his initiative. This request for an additional $91 mil\u00ad lion for the Rover program, as it is called, also awards eminent recognition of the great advances that have been scored in nuclear rocket engine experiments under the joint efforts of the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Space and Aeronautics Administration. Certainly congratulations should go out to the ded\u00ad icated men who have worked so long and so well in this undertaking. To underscore these achievements and to point to the potential of the nuclear rocket engine, I would like to direct specific attention to that portion of the President's message which discusses these factors: This engine will substantially increase our nation's space capabllities, and w111 give our larger rockets and spacecraft immensely in\u00ad creased power and versatility. In the nuclear rocket program which has been moving forward during the last decade, the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis\u00ad tration and the Atomic Energy Comm.ission have successfully tested reactors and engines With 55,000 pounds of thrust. Government scientists and engineers have now concluded that a much more powerful nuclear engine would have distinct advan\u00ad tages over rockets now in use. I am recom\u00ad mending that the United States Government move ahead with the development of a nuclear engine having a potentia.l of 200,000 to 250,000 pounds of thTust. Such an engine could be used for a new and much more powerful third stage for our Saturn V launch vehicle. Because of its very high emciency, it could: Permit us almost to double the welght of the present payload of the Saturn V vehicle; Increase our ab111ty to maneuver space\u00ad craft; and, Be used in future manned landings and explorations of far distant planets. The President goes on to say that pres\u00ad ent plans call for delivery of the first test engine by 1971. But if the men of AEC and NASA continue the pace of success they have established, we may advance that target date by a year or more. \u00b7 Mr. President, my major purpose in speaking now is to call for fuli. congres\u00ad sional support of this important project that looks beyond the moon and beyond the rapid advances of orthodox rocketry. For it will, I am convinced, vault the United States far into the lead in space exploration and research. I wrote .the President in\u00b7 support of this project acceleration February 9, stressing that I believed it imperative to provide additional moneys to guarantee success. I am proud that the Atomic Energy Commission's test site in Nevada has be-come the proving grounds for this rocket engine of the future, and I am doubly proud that much of the acceleration pro\u00ad posed by the President will be concen\u00ad trated at the nuclear rocket develop\u00ad ment station there-some $22.5 million for expansion of engine systems \u00b7 work and testing facilities construction alone. This will indeed make the Nevada test site the launching pad for America's nu\u00ad clear race into space. ADDITIONAL AEC AND NASA FUNDS Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the administra\u00ad tion, has made a decision to press for\u00ad ward with its highly succes~ful nuclear rocket engine development program. The President noted in his 1968 fiscal budget t:Q.at excellent progress had been made in experimentation with regard to our national commitment to develop this unique and most essential method of space travel. Last week another test was conducted in this continuing program in Nevada and the results were again highly en\u00ad couraging. They indicate that we can go forward from the development of a 50,000-pound thrust engine to a 250,000- pound thrust engine. This means that instead of conducting a barebones level system of testing, our scientists will be able to proceed with the logical new steps indicated by their experience. Following the budget message of the administration, I wrote to the President urging that he take this step. I told him then that the successes of 1966 \"gave hope that the atomic rocket engine will, indeed, give America unquestioned space leadership in the future.\" I further related to the President that- we are faced with the prospect wherein if we do not move ahead we will have to phase out existing capabilities and waste much of the enormous investment which thus far has been made to bring us to the sp encouraging point in the nuclear rocket engine program as we are today. It is clear that the additional capability of the nuclear engine, including its importance in upgrad\u00ad ing Saturn V, makes release of the funds critical to our overall posture in spa.ce. Mr. President, $100 m11lion is involved in the recommendation which the Sen\u00ad ate will be studying. I submit that this is a modest cost for the benefits which are to be created for our space program. I am, of course, very proud of the role which Nevada will continue to play in this program. Approximately $22.5 mil\u00ad lion will be spent in my State on the de\u00ad sign and construction of two enormous test stands which will permit adequate testing for the development of these new high thrust atomic engines. It will be a welcome addition to Nevada's rapidly growing capability in this futuristic field which has become an integral part of the economy of my State. It is reassuring to know that this pro\u00ad posal will receive the thorough review which it will unquestionably be given by the senior Senator from New Mexico [Mr. ANDERSON], chairman of the Com\u00ad mittee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, on which I also serve. 4696 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 THE NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND THE HUMANITIES Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise at this time to commend to my colleagues at\u00ad tention to that specific portion of the President's message on education which dealt with the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities. As the chief Senate sponsor of the enabling leg\u00ad islation which created the Foundation, I am pleased that the President has seen fit to recommend funding for this new agency in the amount of $16,370,000 for the coming fiscal year. While this amount is less than the authorized ceilings for Federal support of the Foundation's activities, it repre:.. sents an important step forward from the sums appropriated for the present fiscal year. I am most hopeful that the Congress will approve the full amount recommended by the President. In terms of the broad mandate we have given to the new Foundation to advance the quality of our Nation's life, this rela\u00ad tively modest investment is, I believe, of high consequence. The program which is involved should be encouraged in every possible way. It is central to the goals we seek now and for the future. The potentials of this program, which clearly recognizes the fundamental values of our cultural well-being are immense. These values are basic to our growth as a ma\u00ad ture nation. Throughout history leading nations have placed gre~t emphasis on the development of the arts and human\u00ad ities, or the creative talents of the in\u00ad dividual, and on the contributions great artists and scholars make to society. At this critical time in our history, these values are of paramount importance. As President Johnson said when he transmitted the administration bill to create a National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, for considera\u00ad tion by the 89th Congress: This Congress will consider many programs which will leave an enduring mark on Amer\u00ad ican life. But it may well be that passage of this legislation, modest as it is, will help secure for this Congress a sure and honored place in the story of the advance of our civilization . I believe that this prophecy and prom\u00ad ise is being well fulfilled. Guided by their two councils of outstanding private citizen artists and scholars, and under the leadership of their two distinguished chairmen, Roger L. Stevens and Barnaby C. Keeney, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities are working in close partnership, in accord with the spirit and purpose of the authorizing legisla\u00ad tion. National endowment for the arts pro~ grams are supporting the development and growth of the arts at both a Na\u00ad tional and State level. To date more than 90 projects have been initiated at a national level and close to 300 other worthwhile projects by the States them\u00ad selves. Initial programs developed by the National Council on the Arts have been designed to: Stimulate enjoyment and appreciation of the arts by creating the widest possi\u00ad ble audience for arts activities of sub\u00ad stantial artistic and cultural signifi\u00ad cance. Encourage and assist individual per\u00ad forming, creative, and visual artists to achieve standards of professional excel\u00ad lence. Develop and expand the capacity of in\u00ad dependent arts institutions and organi\u00ad zations for imaginative and substantive programs. Explore the problems of the arts in America in order to develop new pro\u00ad grams and institutions to meet existing and future needs. Encourage imaginative arts programs in the field of education. Support international arts events which relate to the advancement of the arts in the United States. The National Endowment for the Arts, through the provisions in the law which require funding on a matching basis, has encouraged arts organizations to assume their share of the responsibility for cul\u00ad tural progress. It has developed a pro\u00ad gram in which Federal, State, and local governments are cooperating to broaden opportunities for artists and audiences. It is stimulating new sources of funds and services for the arts. It is fostering an appreciation of the individual creative artist in America today, and it has made comprehensive plans for the future. Several National Endowment for the Arts programs with national implica\u00ad tions are: ACADEMY OF AMERICAN POETS The National Endowment f,or the Arts provided matching funds totaling $79,750 to support the Academy of the American Poets' pilot projects in Detroit, Pitts\u00ad burgh, and New York. The first phase of the project, \"Dialogues on the Art of Poetry,\" is intended to stimulate teacher interest and improve teaching methods by enabling high school instructors to hear poetry readings by outstanding es\u00ad tablished American poets. The second phase, \"Poetry Readings in the Class\u00ad rooms,'' brings younger, lesser known poets into high school classrooms to read and discuss their own poetry with the students, a unique and rewarding expe\u00ad rience for the poets as well as the chil\u00ad dren. In New York, hundreds of teachers at\u00ad tended readings by distinguished Amer\u00ad ican poets, and many thousands of stu\u00ad dents responded enthusiastically to hear\u00ad ing and talking with young poets, an un\u00ad precedented experience for most of them. LABORATORY THEATER PROJECT In cooperation with the U.S. Office of Education and State and local school boards, the National Council on the Arts committed funds to initiate an experi\u00ad mental \"laboratory theater\" project to provide two American cities with profes\u00ad sional theater companies which will pre\u00ad sent outstanding theater performances at no charge to secondary school chil\u00ad dren during weekday afternoons and to adult audiences during weekend per\u00ad formances. This program is designed to develop new audiences of all ages, and to improve the quality of secondary school instruction in dramatic literature by making live professional theater pro- ductions of outstanding quality an in\u00ad tegral part of high school curriculum. For example: More than 40,000 sec\u00ad ondary school students from every part of my own state of Rhode Island are having the opportunity to attend up to five free performances of Providence's Trinity Square Repertory Company, and more than 50,000 secondary school stu\u00ad dents from New Orleans and surrounding areas are being shown, at no cost to themselves, the productions of the newly created Repertory Theater, New Orleans. RURAL ARTS PROGRAM The National Council on the Arts launched a pilot program to develop artists and audiences in five small rural communities through support of the University of Wisconsin College of Agri\u00ad culture's Wisconsin Idea Theater. The rural arts program is exposing small towns to a variety of creative, performing, and visual arts programs which involve locating and supporting local artists and craftsmen, and inviting professional artists to participate in ac\u00ad tivities, performances, and exhibits. Community reaction is constantly being evaluated by the university and the towns compared to two similar commu\u00ad nities which are not participating in the program, so that better plans for ex\u00ad panding the benefits of the arts to small communities can be made at a national and State level. MARTHA GRAHAM NATIONAL TOUR The National Endowment for the Arts made $142,250 available on a matching basis to enable the Martha Graham Dance Company to make its first na\u00ad tional tour in 15 years. Although Miss Graham has been internationally ac\u00ad claimed as the founder and leading ex\u00ad ponent of modern dance, millions of Americans had never had the opportu\u00ad nity to view performances by her out\u00ad standing company which has been financially unable to tour the United States. During the 8-week tour in the fall of 1966, audiences and critics in 32 cities applauded the company's excellence. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTURE, PLANNING, AND DESIGN The National Council on the Arts is studying the organization, structure, and functions of a proposed National Insti\u00ad tute of Architecture, Planning, and Design. The institute is envisioned as an inde\u00ad pendent facility which will serve citizens, cities, and States in their search for higher quality in the physical environ\u00ad ment. It is anticipated that the insti\u00ad tute will involve leading architects, plan\u00ad ners. and designers, as well as mayors, planning commissioners, Governors, in\u00ad dustrialists, educators, public officials, and private citizens, in programs to en\u00ad hance all pertinent aspects of the arts of architecture, planning, landscape archi\u00ad tecture, and design as they relate to the environment. AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE The National Council on the Arts is developing a plan to establish an Ameri\u00ad can Film Institute comparable to organi\u00ad zations presently operating in other nations. This plan involves the creation of an entirely new national arts institu\u00ad tion capable of enhancing the art of film making throughout the United States. President Johnson endorsed this concept at the signing ceremonies of the National February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4697 Foundation on the Arts and the Humani\u00ad ties Act of 1965 when he said: We will create an American Film Institute, bringing together leading artists of the film industry, outstanding educators, and young men and women who wish to pursue the Twentieth Century art form as their life's work. PROJECT FOR YOUNG MUSICIANS The National Council on the Arts is developing a program which will give young musicians the opportunity to par\u00ad ticipate as soloists in national tours. A program is under way to develop a unique American Lyric Theatre workshop, com\u00ad bining a variety of the arts, and under the experienced leadership of one of our country's most talented artists, Jerome Robbins, who has generously agreed to devote his time and energies to the proj\u00ad ect without personal compensation. The National Endowment for the Hu\u00ad manities entered the present fiscal year with the dual tasks of developing its program and making its first major series of awards. Before discussing these efforts, I should like to make some gen\u00ad eral comments about why it is important that the \u00b7endowment succeed in its efforts. In its annual report, the endow\u00ad ment said: A striking point of the last decade of American life has been the growing frustra\u00ad tion in public life as realization developed that our wealth, our superb technical and material skills, our undifferentiated desire for the superlative across the gamut of our national existence, created as many, perhaps more, problems than they solved. AB though to mock our material progress, darkening problems of urbanization, of lacerating political and social division, and of aimless discontent grow with our progress. It is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration to say that the country is passing through a crisis of confidence in its achievements and its aspirations-indeed, itself. Barnaby C. Keeney, former president of Brown University, now the chairman of the endowment, has said: It is in response to this climate of anxiety that the Endowment faces its most chal\u00ad lenging opportunity-to increase the interest in and use of the humanities by our citizens, and to improve their access to them. Other things can make us wealthy and powerful; the humanities are to make us wise, and they lead us to apply our wisdom in ways which can heal both private and public life. It is urgently in the national interest to make available to the broad public as well as the scholarly community the attitudes of mlnd, the methods of assessing value, the self-knowledge and civic knbwledge which are the ultimate contributions of the human\u00ad ities to public and private life. If a brood public can be encouraged to appreciate and understand the humanities, they may habit\u00ad ually use this knowledge in making their public and private decisions. It is impos\u00ad sible to calculate the beneficial national ef\u00ad fect of \"being scientific;\" but few would question that such an outlook has been of fundamental importance in achieving our present material good fortune at home and our leadership abroad. We are persuaded that \"being humanistic,\" both in our schools and colleges and outside them, is equally necessary for solutions to our national an\u00ad guishes, to maintain our leadership abroad, and to represent to the world what the qual\u00ad ity of human life can be. No less than this is the ultimate objective of the Endowment, am.d we believe that it was an expression of such hopes and convictions that the Prest-dent and Congress established the Endow\u00ad ment. The need, as the President put it, is \"not only in enriching scholarship but in enriching life for all people.\" To meet this national need, the Humanities Endowment is operating fellowship programs to develop the ca\u00ad pacities of individual scholars and teach\u00ad ers in the humanities, research grant programs to support the discovery of new knowledge and insight in those fields which contribute so much to an under\u00ad standing of what it is to be a human being, and educational and public grant programs to improve the teaching of the humanities in schools, colleges and uni\u00ad versities, and among the public at large. Two of the fellowship programs are directed toward the young scholar and teacher, who is not yet in a position to compete with senior scholars of estab\u00ad lished reputation, yet whose need is par\u00ad ticularly great because he is at a critical stage of his development as a scholar and teacher; the third fellowship pro\u00ad gram is aimed at the senior scholar who needs time off from his other duties in order to make a contribution of major significance to his field. In the present year, fellowships were awarded to scholars from just under 200 educational institutions located in 44 States and the District of Columbia, and including scholars unaffiliated with aca\u00ad demic centers. The endowment awarded 100 6-to 8-month fellowships to young scholars, 130 summer fellowships for young scholars, and 57 senior fellowships. The distribution of the fellowships among numerous States and institutions is especially noteworthy, since so many Federal and private fellowship programs in all fields tend to concentrate at a relatively small number of preS'tigious institutions. The programs in support of research in the humanities have provided funds for over 80 projects in the present fiscal year. Many of these projects have an imme\u00ad diate usefulness in enabling Americans\u00ad whether scholars, teachers, students, or the general public-to better understand the American experience and tradition, but as a whole they offer the promise of contributing to our knowledge of our\u00ad selves as well as of our past. As Mr. Keeney has put it: In order to develop a broad national policy of support for the humanities, we must en\u00ad able humanists to provide knowledge and un\u00ad derstanding of what is past, or abstract, or aesthetic. By gaining perspective on the past, thoughtful men may be inspired to a vision of future achievement, and if they are given the means to develop their wisdom they will come to understand and to master them\u00ad selves in their environment. The Humanities Endowment's educa\u00ad tional and public programs have aimed in the present year at encouraging joint co\u00ad operative efforts by institutions which traditionally operate at different levels and with different conceptions of their scope and purpose. Schools and colleges have received grants to improve the teaching of the humanities therein; museums and universities have received grants which encourage them to make their strengths available to one another; colleges and universities have received grants to permit them to take better mu-tual advantage of their respective facili\u00ad ties; and additional grants which cut across the traditional perimeters of sepa\u00ad rate activities in the humanities have been made to provide support for educa\u00ad tional television, talking books, train\u00ad ing of journalistic critics, and the per\u00ad sonnel of the Nation's 3,500 State and local historical societies. One particular grant of the Humanities Endowment illustrates the way in which all of its grants have reinforced one an\u00ad other to strengthen the Nation's resources in the humanities. By a grant of $300,- 000 to the Modern Language Association of America to support a center for the editing and publishing of accurate edi\u00ad tions of major American authors such as Twain, Melville, and Hawthorne, scholars in the field of literature will have a valu\u00ad able addition to their understanding of what these authors in fact intended to say, while teachers and students, as well as the general public, will have more satisfactory texts of the works of these American giants. In announcing the grant, Mr. Keeney said: It is extraordinary that the works of many American writers since the mid-19th century exist only in inaccurate and incomplete edi\u00ad tions. Some texts of their works which are in wide dis\u00b7trlbution are thoroughly Inac\u00ad curate and Inisleading, and quently in Inisinterpretatlons of the inten\u00ad tions of the writers, not only by students and the lay public but by scholars as well. The Modem Language Association Award is intended to remedy this situa\u00ad tion. The Humanities Endowment is also negotiating to insure that the standard texts which will result will be published in inexpensive and widely available editions, as well as in its \"talk\u00ad ing books\" grant. All of these efforts for the humanities have been made upon a budget in the present fiscal year of $4,500,000. Com\u00ad menting upon the awards made by the endowment with so small a sum, the Washington Star said: -That relatively small amount already makes the Endowment the prime source of financing for achievement in the humanities. This stark fact, in contrast to the vast amounts of Federal money being spent on the sciences, is ample proof of the need for the Endowment. This is a sentiment which I share, and a situation which I hope Congress will see fit to improve in future actions. Sup\u00ad port for the humanities and the arts at higher levels of funding is worthy of our closest consideration. DO NOT CUT EDUCATION FUNDS Mr. HART. Mr. President, I have said repeatedly that it would be tragic for the Nation to cut back on its vital domestic programs because of the added financial burden of Vietnam. I continually re\u00ad ceive similar pleas from knowledgeable Michigan residents. One recent example concerning the need for maintaining full funding for education and education research programs comes to me from John E. Ivey, Jr., dean of the College of Education of Michigan State University. Because he states the need so well, I ask unanimous consent that his letter be. printed at this point in the RECORD. 4698 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, East Lansing, Mich., January 6,1967. Senator PHILIP A. HART, East Bluff, Mackinac Island, Mich. DEAR SENATOR HART: Those concerned With education throughout the StaJte of M1ch1ga.n have benefited greatly from the past efforts. of the Congress of the United States. As a result of e1fortl! within the past two years, school children are receiving instruotf.on in exciting new programs; neglected segments of our society are now finding educational opportunities long deni\u00b7ed them; additional, top-quality, young persons are being en\u00ad oour:a.ged to enter the educational profession; experienced teachers are receiving encourage\u00ad ment to oontinue programs of self improve\u00ad ment; new and sorely needed fac111ties are rising on the campuses of the nation's col\u00ad leges and universities; and, for the first time, large funds have been made ava.ila.ble for resea.roh on the vexing and perplexing prob\u00ad lems involved in educative processes. If the rate at which a soc:iety progresses is greatly influenced by its capacity to educate, then this moment in history is crucial to so\u00ad ciety. The Congress must not now turn its back upon the need to carry forward the research and fellowship programs now under\u00ad way. These programs must be can:1ed for\u00ad ward without diminution if ga.ins are to be consolidated. As a member of the 90th Oongress, you w111 soon be called upon to pass judgment on the unfintshed work of the 89th Congress. That judgment, in part, will be to approve or deny appropriations designed to fund the author\u00ad imtions previously approved and will have great consequence on the future of public education at all levels. I recognize many of the pressures you will face as the appropriation processes are un\u00ad dertaken. Nevertheless, my professional col\u00ad leagues and I urgently sollclt your support in reta.ln1ng a.n.d expanding those progra.ms through Which the Congress extends fina.n\u00ad cia.l support to educational and educational research progmms. Sincerely yours, JoHN E. IVEY, Jr., Dean. Mr. HART. Mr. President, a second letter is from Dr. Ira Polley, the Michi\u00ad gan Superintendent of Public Instruc\u00ad tion. Dr. Polley argues persuasively the case for increased appropriations to im\u00ad plement the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that Dr. Polley's letter also be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, Lansing, Mich., February 20,1967. Hon. PHILIP A. HART, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR HART: President Johnson's budget contains modest increases for Ele\u00ad mentary and Secondary Education Act pro\u00ad grams. We would like to emphasize that they do not meet either the present demand for service or the authorized ceiling which thE; Congress established in 1966. Federal aid to education has been a vigor\u00ad ous spur to action here in Michigan. Under the impetus of the Vocational Education Act of 1963, the State has launched a major program for constructing area technical\u00ad vocational schools. The State has received programs from local districts for $15 million for supplemental educational services under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Over 8,000 youths were en\u00ad abled last year to stay in school, because of the work and subsistence provisions of the 1965 Vocational Education Act. The State of Michigan has, in the past two years, responded to this federal effort. It established a $4 million fund for aid to educationally deprived children; it Included adult high school completion expenses in the basic State aid formula; it raised the level of support for special education; it provided 75 percent State aid for remedial reading; and it increased the level of state support of local schools to about 50 percent of operational costs. The combination of these state and fed\u00ad eral programs has generated an important thrust in our elementary and secondary schools. School districts have been encour\u00ad aged to find useful new ways and means of serving the children of the poor, the dis\u00ad tressed, and the deprived. They have been encouraged to find better ways to educate the averag.e child. I hope that you will find it possible to continue the momentum of these prograzns, and that you will be able to support ele\u00ad mentary and secondary education appropria\u00ad tions equal to the 1966 authorizatio~. The price of these progra.ms wm be returned several times over in the future careers of the children who are helped now. If you desire elaboration on any of the programs I have mentioned, please ask. I will be happy to provide further detail re\u00ad garding the extent of the impact federal aid has had in any Michigan education area. Sincerely yours, IRA PoLLEY. I AMENDMENT OF EXECUTIVE T\u00ad CONVENTION ON GREAT LAKES FISHERIES Mr. HART. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice in support of amending the Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries to increase the representation of the United States and Canada by one member each to the Great Lakes Commission, thus pro\u00ad viding four Commissioners from each country instead of three. Over the past few years the Commis\u00ad sion has concentrated its efforts on con\u00ad trolling the sea lamprey problem princi\u00ad pally in the western Great Lakes\u00ad Superior, Michigan, and Huron-where the devastation to the lake trout was most acute. For this reason it has been appropriate for the two public members of the U.S. section on the Commission to come from this area of the Great Lakes. The Commission's efforts have met with outstanding success. Where only a few years ago the trout fisheries in Lake Superior had been reduced to prac\u00ad tically zero, trout are now well on their way back. In addition, we are witnessing a rapid growth in trout in Lake Michigan and look forward to their abundance in the years ahead. As the sea lamprey control efforts move across to the eastern Great Lakes, I can fully appreciate the desire of the eastern lake States to have representa\u00ad tion on the Commission. Since the stated purpose of increasing the member\u00ad ship on the Great Lakes Fisheries Com\u00ad mission is to provide just such repre\u00ad sentation, I am happy to endorse this aim and support ratification of the amendment to Executive T. THE REIMBURSEMENT FORMULA FOR MEDICARE Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, recently the American Protestant Hospital Asso-. elation at its annual meeting adopted a resolution urging that certain changes be made in the current reimbursement formula for hospital patients eligible for medicare. It is the position of the APHA that the present allowance of only 2 percent of hospital basic costs for re\u00ad furbishing, modernization, and expan\u00ad sion is inequitable and that other pro\u00ad cedures need to be revised. The president of APHA, Mr. Jack A. L. Hahn, who is also the executive direc\u00ad tor of the Methodist Hospital of Indian\u00ad apolis, Ind., has pointed out that under the present formula \"self-supporting hospital patients are paying more than their share of hospital expenses.\" If this be true, and there apparently is sub\u00ad stantial evidence to support it, serious questions of policy are raised by the op\u00ad eration of the schedule approved by the Social Security Administration. In order that all Members of Congress will have the opportunity to examine the objections and the recommendations made by the American Protestant Hos\u00ad pital Association, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that the resolution adopted by its house of delegates and board of trustees be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the resolu\u00ad tion was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: RESOLUTION RE MEDICARE BY THE AMERICAN PROTESTANT HOSPITAL AsSOCIATION, CHI\u00ad CAGO, ILL. 1. Whereas the American Protestant Hos\u00ad pital Association recognizes that Medicare 1s the Law of the land; and 2. Whereas the A.P .H.A. acknowledges the responsib111ty for hospitals contributing to successful implementation of Medicare; and 3. Whereas it is the intent of public law 89-97 to pay for fUll costs of providing hos\u00ad pital service to Medicare patients; and 4. Whereas the Social Security Adm1nistra\u00ad tion has developed a reimbursement formula for Medicare which does not cover the full econoinic cost of providing hospital serv\u00ad ice; and 5. Whereas it 1s discriminatory to other pa\u00ad tients to carry the financial burden for costs not covered by Medicare which must be in\u00ad curred to provide service to all patients; and 6. Whereas the church and the commu\u00ad nity have invested Inilllons of dollars in the typical community voluntary hospital, to provide it with the capab111ty of serving; this investment merits a return, but requires at m,inimum a reimbursement from pur\u00ad chases of service sumcient to preserve 1t against infiation and obsolescence; and 7. Whereas it is an economic truism that operating capital and plant capital must be expanded proportionately to expanded func\u00ad tions; and 8. Whereas patients covered by Medicare are absorbing fac111ties needed by all seg\u00ad ments of the community at a steadily in\u00ad creasing amount for communities to expand hospital fac111ties; and 9. Whereas Medicare will cost the Volun\u00adtary Hospital System m1llions of dollars be\u00ad cause of the premature and inadequate ap\u00ad plication of the R.C.C. (ratio of charges to cost) method without allowing hospitals a reasonable period of time to convert to a cost related charge system, and which will incur a loss in capital which hospitals can\u00ad not afford; and 10. Whereas Medicare has added to the cost of operation of hospitals by requiring multi-part forzns instead of simplified re\u00ad ports which are technically acceptable, and in developing the most complicated account\u00ad ing and reimbursement formulae ever de-February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4699 vised by a purchaser of hospital care (with particular emphasis on Part B benefits); and 11. Whereas the continuance of high qual\u00ad ity and efficient care is threatened and the very existence of the Voluntary Hospital Sys\u00ad tem is in jeopardy; and . 12. Whereas the A.P.H.A. recognizes the d111gence of the American Hospital Associa\u00ad tion and the difficulties they have encoun\u00ad tered in attempting to obtain changes in the Medicare reimbursement formula: Now therefore be it Resolved, That: 1. The A.P .H.A. protests the costly and cumbersome methods imposed on hospitals in submitting bills for service; and 2. The A.P.H.A. \u00b7expresses opposition to the complicated and untenable formula of re\u00ad imbursement for Part B services; and 3. The A.P.H.A. protests the unfairness of the Medicare relm.bursement formula with particular reference to the 2% allowance for costs not included in reimbursable expenses, and expresses alarm because of the economic deterioration it is causing to hospitals all over the United States; and 4. The A.P.H.A. protests the apparent un\u00ad willingness of the Social Security Adminis\u00ad tration to give serious consideration to the deficiencies in the Medicare formula or to the consequences of these deficiencies as they pertain to: a. Replacement value depreciation, b. Obsolescence losses, c. The community-wide load of charity and bad debts, d. The encumbered income required to maintain necessary levels of operating cash, inventories, and accounts receivable, e. Principal payments on loans for facili\u00ad ties expansion, f. Principal payments on loans for mod\u00ad ernization or extensive rehab111tation, g. Principal payments on cost reducing investments which can be paid for from re\u00ad ductions in expense, h. Principal payments on loans for pro\u00ad viding operating capital, 1. Principal payment on indebtedness as noted previously, whether it involves exist\u00ad ing or future capital obligations. Until effective methods can be agreed upon to measure the full costs of providing hos\u00ad pital care, the A.P.H.A. maintains that in\u00ad creasing the present 2% allowance to 7% would provide a modest and minimally ac\u00ad ceptable substitute. 5. A.P.H.A. recognizes the obligation of voluntary hospitals to all age groups, and firmly believes that hospitals cannot con\u00ad tinue indefinitely with a contractual agree\u00ad ment for reimbursement at less than full economic cost for Medicare patients; and 6. The A.P.H.A. observes that the Volun\u00ad tary Hospital System and the Private Prac\u00ad tice of Medicine have jointly contributed to an outstanding and generally excellent health system, maintains that the system can improve along with medical and tech\u00ad nological progress, and can expand to meet many unfulfilled needs in accordance with local and regional hospital plans providing that under-financing is eliminated as a bar\u00ad rier; and 7. The A.P.H.A. will publicize its position on the rejection of the present Medicare re\u00ad imbursement formula, and will do every\u00ad thing within its power to seek adequate and equitable payment, and will actively seek the support of others to attain this objective. Adopted by the House of Delegates Jan\u00ad uary 23, 1967. Approved by tJ:le Board of Trustees Jan\u00ad uary 24, 1967. COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS Mr. TYDINGS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that President Johnson has called for an extension of the Commu-nity Mental Health Centers Act, in his message today on educ.ation and health. Our communities needed Federal help in 1963, when the law wa.s first enacted, and they need it now. Under this act, we will have assisted States and commu\u00ad nities in providing mental health serv\u00ad ices to 44 million Americ.ans by the end of 1967. If the act is extended-and I hope the Congress will grant President Johnson's request-we can expect 135 million peo\u00ad ple to benefit in the coming 5 years. The people in our States and local communities have been willing to put their money and manpower into combat\u00ad ing and treating mental illness. The Federal funds provided under this act have brought rich returns in cooperation at all levels of government. In Maryland, Federal grants totaling $758,000 to local communities .are aiding construction of mental health facilities at Prince Georges General Hospital in Cheverly, and Holy Cross Hospital in Sil\u00ad ver Spring; and providing staffing funds for the inner-city community mental health center in Baltimore. The ~ry\u00ad land Department of Mental Health re\u00ad ceived $99,600 in fiscal 1967 for staffing, in order to develop such service.s as alco\u00ad holism outpatient clinics and local men\u00ad tal health day centers to enable those who need treatment to get it while living at home with their families. Federal funds have also supplemented in-service training programs at all Maryland State hospitals and aided many State hospitals in improvement programs. And feder\u00ad ally financed mental health research projects are developing new knowledge in subjects such as group ther.apy and psychopharmacology at Johns Hopkins University, and at the University of Maryland. For the patients themselves-whether they are emotionally disturbed children or elderly persons suffering the mental diseases of old age-our efforts to de\u00ad velop .services in the communities me,an an end to isolation in a distant hospital, removed from family and familiar sur\u00ad roundings. It is reassuring that President Johnson has recognized the accomplishinents of this program .and the need to continue such a promising beginning. EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, the Federal Government has supported the development of educational television for almost 5 years. We have made sub\u00ad stantial progress in increasing the num\u00ad ber of operating stations. The time has now come, however, as the President has made abundantly clear in his education message, for us to move dramatically in the direction of not only more educa\u00ad tional television facilities, but also higher quality educational television program\u00ad ing and services. The President has proposed a magnifi\u00ad cent plan whic.h is aimed at strengthen\u00ad ing every facet of educational television. The added funds for the construction of facilities and purchase of equipment will bring us measurably closer to our goal of a high-power color signal for 90 per\u00ad cent of our population. The proposal to establish a public cor\u00ad poration is imaginative and, in time, will lead to a remarkable upgrading of educa\u00ad tional television programing. The con\u00ad cept of the public corporation has the added advantages of enabling the Fed\u00ad eral Government to promote quality while simultaneously leaving the deci\u00ad sions for program content in the hands of local stations, where they rightfully belong. Not only will the proposed public cor\u00ad poration stimulate the production of high quality programs, it will also encourage the training of highly qualified persons to work in educational television. If educational television is to compete suc\u00ad cessfully with the programs produced by commercial stations, it will require greater numbers of creative and skilled personnel. The President's proposal will take a large step toward recruiting and training such people. In addition to the advantages for the improvement of educational television programing and the stimulation and upgrading of recruitment antl training, the President's proposal for a public television corporation will attract the at\u00ad tention and support of a wide range of philanthropic individuals and corpora\u00ad tions and, thus, will enable educational television at last to acquire the depth and breadth of financial aid it has need\u00ad ed for so long. Though not calling for a large outlay of funds, I think it is, nevertheless, im\u00ad portant to emphasize that the Presi\u00ad dent's proposal also asks for an exten\u00ad sive study of television as it is used in instructional settings. If we are to meet adequately the pressing problems of both the pupil population explosion and the knowledge explosion, it may well be that instructional television is our answer. Thus it is vitally important that we take the time and money today and invest it in planning for the optimum use of instructional television for tomorrow. Finally I would like to call your at\u00ad tention tb the fact that the President's proposal will enable educational radio at last to come in for its share of support and encouragement. The events of the television era, as remarkable as they are, have amply demonstrated that radio yet can pl-ay a vital function. It is time we planned to use it well, and to capitalize upon its unique benefits. Television and radio are remarkable examples of modern technology at its best. The time has come, however, when we must begin to adapt the benefits of this technology to education. I strongly believe that the President's proposals will be a dramatic step in this direction. DELIVER:Y OJ' HEALTH CARE I also commend the President for his recommendation for a new center to study and improve our methods for the delivery of medical care. All of us, I know, have been heartened and delighted by the tremendous accom\u00ad plishments of our medical scientists. We have read with excitement about their new discoveries-new surgical opera\u00ad tions, new diagnostic methods, new drugs to cure infections, new vitamins and hor\u00ad mones, new agents to control mental disease. 4700 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 It is true, our physicians tell us, that today we possess the knowledge which can prevent or cure a host of age-old diseases. It is true that we possess the knowledge which can bring better health and added years of productivity to most Americans. But it is also true-as we have seen too often with our own eyes-that this lifesaving knowledge is not reaching millions of our people. Too many children, this year, are being crippled by forms of heart disease which we know how to prevent. Too inany women, this year, are dying from forms of cancer which we know how to detect and how to control. Too many people, this year, are suffer\u00ad ing from infectious diseases which we know how to cure. It is tragic when any child or any adult suffers or dies from a disease against which our physicians are help\u00ad less. But it is infinitely more tragic, and, totally unpardonable, when any in\u00ad dividual suffers from an ailment when an effective treatment is known but not applied. We can no longer allow our limited supply of skilled health professionals\u00ad doctors and dentists and nurses-waste their precious time doing routine jobs which less skilled assistants can do equally well. We can no longer squander the time of our health workers by having them perform tasks which can be handled as well or even better by electronic devices. We can no longer dissipate our support for health facilities in building new hos\u00ad pitals and new nursing homes and new clinics according to the styles that might have been good enough for the 1920's and the 1930's, but which are not good enough to meet the needs of the 1970's and the 1980's. We can no longer let outmoded meth\u00ad ods of health financing block patients from getting the care, the high quality care, they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Unless we can develop the improved methods to provide the requisite appli\u00ad cation of our available knowledge, we will have wasted the tremendous investment we have already made in dollars and in the dedicated efforts of our scientists. We cannot waste this investment. We cannot let this opportunity escape. We cannot a void this responsibility. I urge my fellow members to join with me in supporting the creation of a Na\u00ad tional Center for Health Services Re\u00ad search to improve the health of all Amer\u00ad icans. FISHERIES, MARITIME FACILITA\u00ad TION AND CUSTOMS TREATIES Mr. LAUCHE. Mr. President, there are on the Executive Calendar of the Senate the following treaties: Executive H, 89th Congress, second session, Exploration of the Sea Conven\u00ad tion. Executive T, 89th Congress, second session, Notes amending the Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries. \u00b7 Executive U, 89th Congress, second session, International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. Executive Q, 89th Congress, second session, Convention of Mar del Plata on Facilitation of International Waterborne Transportation. Executive R, 89th Congress, second session, Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic. _ Executive K, 89th Congress, second session, Customs Convention on the Temporary Importation of Professional Equipment. Executive L, 89th Congress, second session, Customs Convention on the ATA Carnet for the Temporary Admission of Goods. Executive M, 89th Congress second session, Customs Convention Regarding ECS Carnets for Commercial Samples. Executive J, 89th Congress, second session, Customs Convention on Con\u00ad tainers. Executive N, 89th Congress, second session, Customs Convention on the International Transport of Goods Under Cover of TIR Carnets. Since the majority leader plans to call up these treaties for a vote tomorrow, I thought it might be helpful for the Sen\u00ad ate to have explanatory statements available before they are considered. FISHERIES TREATIES The first group of treaties before the Senate includes the three fishery items Nos. 1, 2, and 3 on the calendar .: The Convention for the International Coun\u00ad cil for the Exploration of the Sea <Ex. H., 89th Cong., 2d sess.); the notes amending the Lakes Fisheries <Ex. T., 89th Cong., 2d sess.); 89th Cong., 2d sess.). They all have the same basic aim of conserving the living resources of the seas. This is accomplished through the establishment of commissions which study these resources and on the basis of these studies recommended conservation measures to the participating countries. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea is concerned with fishery resources in the Atlantic with particular emphasis on the Northeastern Atlantic. It was established in 1902 and the United States was briefly a member of it before World War I. It is now getting its first formal constitution and the administration thinks it is desirable to have the United States be a party to it again because of its broadening scope, the important and growing fisheries and oceanographic programs of our country and the fact that this Council works closely with other organizations of which we are a member. The Great Lakes Fisheries Commis\u00ad sion obviously is concerned with the Great Lakes. A rather minor amend\u00ad ment to the original convention ap\u00ad proved in 1955 is before the Committee, enlarging the Commission from six to eight members, with three instead of four appointed from each the United States and Canada. The enlargement is to give representation to the Eastern Great Lakes States, since the Commis\u00ad sion until recently had been mostly con\u00ad cerned with the sea lamprey problem in the Western Great Lakes and represen\u00ad tation on the Commission was drawn from the States bordering those lakes. The Atlantic Tuna Convention con\u00ad cerns tuna and tunalike fish in the whole Atlantic. Is is very closely pat\u00ad terned on the Northwest Atlantic Fish\u00ad eries Convention of 1949 which deals with cod, haddock, flounder, and the like. Like it, it provides for a commission to study the tuna and formulate conserva\u00ad tion measures to be recommended to the participating countries. None of these recommendations will be binding on the United States if we disapprove of them. The exploitation of tuna in the Atlantic has been on a rapid increase and in the eyes of United States and other fish\u00ad ery experts the time is at hand to pre\u00ad pare conservation measures. My subcommittee held hearings on these fishery matters on February 7 and, so far as is known, there is absolutely no opposition to these treaties. In fact, on the Tuna Convention we had two specific endorsements from the Tuna Research Foundation and the American Tunaboat Association. Conservation is certainly in the high\u00ad est U.S. tradition and for that reason, the Committee on Foreign Relations recom\u00ad mends that the Semi.te advise and con\u00ad sent to ratification of these treaties. MARITIME FACILITATION CONVENTIONS The two conventions in the next group-Nos. 4 and 5 on the Executive Calendar-the Inter-American Conven\u00ad tion on Facilitation of International Waterborne Transportation-Executive Q, 89th Congress, second session-and the Convention on Facilitation of Inter\u00ad national Maritime Traffic-Executive R, 89th Congress, second session-deal with paperwork for ships on international voyages. Their common aim is to re\u00ad duce and standardize the number of papers, the entries on these papers, and the number of copies, that ships have to leave with authorities at ports upon entering and leaving. The two conventions follow the pat\u00ad tern established by the International Civil Aviation Organization-ICAO-for airplanes in international flights, which makes possible their rapid processing through international airports. These treaties are expected to speed up snips on international voyages and thereby reduce the costs to shipowners, travelers, and the shippers of goods. The conventions themselves pledge the parties to adopt all appropriate measures to facilitate and expedite international maritime traffic and to cooperate in se\u00ad curing the highest practicable degree of uniformity in formalities, documentary requirements, and procedures in relation to the entry and clearance of vessels. The annexes to the conventions list the eight basic papers which may be required by port-of-entry officials; namely, gen\u00ad eral declaration, cargo manifest, ship's stores declaration, crew's effects declara\u00ad tion, crew list, passenger list, the Uni\u00ad versal Postal Convention mail document, and the maritime declaration of health. The type of information and number of entries for each of these pieces of papers is further spelled out in detail. I might add that the annexes of the conventions are not subject to ratifica\u00ad tion. To the extent that presently there exist differences between the standards February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4701 and recommended practices contained in them and U.S. laws and regulations, these di:f!erences will be passed on to the administering authorities of the conven\u00ad tions, and will continue to exist until such. time as our administration decides to eliminate them by asking Congress to enact appropriate legislation, if such is necessary. The hearing, by my subcommittee, on February 7 brought out only favorable testimony by executive . branch officials. To their knowledge, there is no opposi\u00ad tion to these conventions. The subcom\u00ad mittee itself received letters urging approval from the Pacific American steamship Association, the Labor-Man\u00ad agement Maritime Committee, the American Merchant Marine Institute, Inc., and the Propeller Club of the United States. At the hearing I wondered why we need two separate conventions which are so very much alike. It appears that the Organization of American States-\u00ad OAS---became active in thiS field first and drafted the Inter-American Conven\u00ad tion. Then the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization\u00ad IMCO-became interested and drafted the international one. The State De\u00ad partment recommends approval of both, so that the simplified standards will have the widest possible application. Mr. President, I recommend that the Senate advise and consent to the ratifi\u00ad cation of these treaties. CUSTOMS CONVENTIONS This last group of treaties before the senate-Calendars Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10-are also designed to assist our inter\u00ad national commerce. As the President states in his letter of transmittal, our accession to them \"will aid the Amer\u00ad ican export drive.\" Briefly, they deal with or are related to the temporary importation of certain equipment and the papers, or so-called carnets, which cover these importa\u00ad tions. The first treaty in this group\u00ad the Customs Convention on the Tem\u00ad porary Importation of Professional Equipment-Executive K, 89th Congress, second session-provides for tempo\u00ad rary-about 6 months-duty-free entry of all kinds of professional equipment, TV cameras, and so forth. An instance where this would be useful is the case of an American broadcasting company sending a crew to Europe to cover an important event. The second treaty\u00ad the customs Convention on the ATA Carnet for the Temporary Admission of Goods-Executive L, 89th Congress, sec\u00ad ond session-provides for the issuance of a document, which the U.S. Council of the International Chamber of Com\u00ad merce has agreed to do, to cover this temporary importation so that bonds do not have to be posted for this equipment. The third treaty-Customs Convention Regarding ECS Carnets for Commercial Samples-Executive M, 89th Congress, second session-does the same for com\u00ad mercial samples covered by the Interna- tional Convention To Facilitate the Im\u00ad portation of Commercial Samples and Advertising Material which we approved in 1956. Again, the U.S. Council of the International Chamber will issue the carnet to make posting of bonds un\u00ad necessary. Under both of these conventions the U.S. Council will be responsible for pay\u00ad ing the duty that would otherwise be due, if the items covered do not leave the country within the proper temporary period. The fourth convention-the Customs Convention on Containers-Executive J, 89th Congress, second session-provides for duty-free temporary entry of those big containers, like lift vans and movable tanks, which are being used increasingly in international trade. They must be of permanent construction, so they can be used repeatedly and must meet other standards. The last convention-Customs Con\u00ad vention on the International Transport of Goods under the cover of TIR car\u00ad nets--Executive N, 89th Congress, sec\u00ad only session-concerns the contents of these containers when they are moved by road and spells out a system of documen\u00ad tation that will provide for inspection and payment of duties only at the final point of destination and not at each bor\u00ad der crossing. In an area like Europe, the advantages of this carnet system are ob\u00ad vious. The common aim of all these treaties is to make it easier for our citizens to \u00b7do business abroad and vice versa. The fact that the American business com\u00ad munity has a deep interest in these trea\u00ad ties is attested by the large volume of favorable mail that the committee has received on them. As a matter of fact the Committee on Commerce, of which I am also a member, has urged approval in particular of the container conven\u00ad tion. I know of no opposition to these treaties. Mr. President, the Committee on For\u00ad eign Relations recommends that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification of these treaties. YOUTH AND THE CHALLENGE OF OUR CITIES Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, on Feb\u00ad ruary 14, the distinguished junior Sena\u00ad tor from Dlinois [Mr. PERCY] delivered the Senior Week address at Villanova University, one of the great universities of my Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Senator PERCY's theme was \"Youth and the Challenge of Our Cities,\" and his remarks were aimed at inspiring today's young people to involve them\u00ad selves in urban problems, as career urban administrators and managers, as volunteers, and as the future shapers of the urban policies of our two political parties. I am pleased that the Senator from Illinois had the opportunity to visit two of Philadelphia's outstanding e:f!orts to improve life for urban people: The Reverend Leon Sullivan's Opportunities Industrialization Center and the Lam\u00ad bert Street Home Ownership project sponsored by the Interfaith Interracial Council of the Clergy, both of which he commends in his speech. I commend Senator PERcY's remarks, especially to young people, upon whom will fall the task of putting into practice so many of the plans conceived today for imroving our cities and creating better lives for their people. I ask unanimous consent that Senator PERCY's Villanova address be printed at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: YOUTH AND THE CHALLENGE OF OuR CITIES (Senior Week address by U.S. Senator CHARLES H. PERCY, Republican of illinois, at Villru\u00ad nova University, Villanova, Pa., Feb. 14, 1967) Professor Charles Abrams, perhaps the dean of America's urban scholars, has said: \"In our own era, the world's cities are wit\u00ad nessing their greatest surge in man's history. Everywhere, hordes of people are leaving the hinterlands in quest of the city's opportuni\u00ad ties ... Our civilization is becoming urban, and the advance into cities is one of the most spectacular social phenomena of our time. The city has become the frontier.\" - Yes, today the city is the frontier. It is, to be sure, a far different kind of frontier that William Penn found here in Delaware County nearly 300 years ago. But like the great American frontier of the 18th and 19th Centuries, today's urban frontier is fraught with challenge and risk-and oppor\u00ad tunity. Daniel Boone and Jim Bridger had an ad\u00ad vantage over the urban pioneer of 1967. At least they pushed ahead into unspoiled wU\u00ad derness, where streaxns ran clear and cold, and the plow turned the rich black dirt three and four feet thick across the prairies. By contrast, the urban pioneer confronts a depressing scene. Traffic clogs our streets. The smoke and soot and smells of our in\u00ad dustrial society pollute the air we breathe. Our lakes and rivers have become sludgy cesspools of raw sewage and industrial waste. Our urban green space has given way to the axe and grader, leaving only treeless con\u00ad crete prairies for the playgrounds of our children. Once stately and respectable buildings de\u00ad cay, first slowly, then rapidly, into wretched slums. And compounded with these physical problems of the declining central city are the far more tragic and batHing problems of wasted human beings-poverty, unemploy\u00ad ment, juvenile delinquency, vice, disease, vio\u00ad lence, and, perhaps most distressing of all because it is the hardest to combat, the feel\u00ad ing of alienation and despair that inhibit the slum dweller from striving to improve himself and his environment. The key question of our day is this: how can we make our cities truly a place for man-not just a location at which he exists, but a psychologically and emotionally satis\u00ad fying habitat in which he may grow to his full potential? Some answers to that question are begin\u00ad ning to emerge from the recent but growing dialogue of concern OV9r the crisis of our cities and their people. I want to discuss a few of them this evening. But first I would impress upon you that even if my generation begins to discern a valid approach to revital\u00ad izing urban life in America, it is your gen\u00ad eration upon whom will largely fall the re\u00ad sponsibility for putting plans into full prac\u00ad tice. What shape the American city will take de\u00ad pends on your response; on your readiness to meet challenges more complex and intrac\u00ad table--and certainly more subtle--than the challenge of landing a man on the moon. The problems of the slum-both physical and psychological-are not the only problems of urban America today. But I wish to ad\u00ad dress myself to those problems-and to the part you can play even now in overcoming 4702 \u00b7coNGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 them~because of \u00b7to sal\u00ad vage the millions of today's slumsdwellers from continued lives of squalor, dejection, and despair. First, ironically , the problems of the slum have been aggravated by the well-intentioned efforts of government itself. Thus urban renewal, aimed at replacing slums with decent housing and taxpaying commercial buildings, has had the con\u00ad comitant effect of uprooting the poor; de\u00ad stroying established neighborhoods, and pro\u00ad ducing new slums, even as modern middle\u00ad income apartments and shopping centers took the place of the old. Public housing, once so enthusiastically advocated as the answer to the low-income housing problem by the professOil\"s and plan\u00ad ners, has fallen far short of their expecta\u00ad tions. Though the grerut publtic housing highrises which line South State Street in Chicago are structurally sound, a.nd though they have fewer !'ats than the slums they replaced, human dignity and decency in them is commonly far lower than in .the older slum neighborhoods that they replaced. This preoccupation With the tdea that gov\u00ad ernment action was the answer was accom\u00ad panied by a disinterest in the potential con\u00ad tributions that private enterprise and the in\u00ad dependent, non-profit sector could make to improving our declining central city areas. But today the revitalization of the slums re\u00ad quires that these enormous resources be brought to bear on their many-faceted problems. Mere lip service to private enterprise is not enough. Our national policy must be re\u00ad oriented to generate the maximum involve\u00ad ment of the private sector-business , labor, the professions, the universities, the non\u00ad profit associations-in creating new oppor\u00ad tunities for today's slums and slum people. The role of government should begin to em\u00ad phasize reinforcement .. and guarantee, rather than execution and control. Second, through the myriad Federal-aid programs for central city housing runs the unhappy theme of dependence. The public housing dweller is at the mercy of the housing authority. The below-market mortgage insurance pro\u00ad gram is available only for rental projects, not ownership projects. The new mortgage insurance program en\u00ad acted last year to promote urban home own\u00ad ership has been deliberately blocked by ad\u00ad ministrative action in Washington. The rent subsidy plan, heralded last year as such an advance, makes the city dwell~ doubly dependent-once upon the landloro, and once upon the government. , The plain fact of the .matter is that home ownership in much of urban America is to\u00ad day rapidly becoming the preserve of the well-to-do-or at least the well-to-do who haven't fled to the mor.e congenial suburbs. To those who might profit by it most--the low-income families yonfined to public hous\u00ad ing and slum tenements-it is not available. For more than anyone else, the poor man yearns for and needs the roots, the security, the identity that are so much more common among his more affluent fellows. For a man who owns his own home ac\u00ad quires with it a new sense of dignity and self-esteem. The ancient adage that \"a man's home is his castle\" reflects the ven\u00ad erated values of home ownership. The home owner begins to take pride in what is his own, and pride in conserving and improving it for his children. He becomes a more steadfast and concerned citizen of his community. The act of becoming a home owner, of realizing its implications and op\u00ad portunities, transforms him. It gives him roots, a sense of belonging, a true stake in his community and its well-being. The overriding imperative in the Nation's war agains.t slums is devising a way of making the values of ownership--particularly home ownership--available to families who pres\u00ad ently cannot share them. I do not pretend this will be easy. But I do maintain that it is time we got to work at it. A third characteristic of the slum problem is the historic separation of the people re\u00ad sponsible for housing and the people re\u00ad sponsible for education, training, social serv\u00ad ices, and welfare. On one hand are the housers. They think in terms of bricks and mortar, contracts and balance sheets, bulldozers and credit ratings. On the other hand are the welfarists. They think in terms of warm clothing, job finding, day care, case work, and child tutor\u00ad ing-the human problems of low-income neighborhoods. ' Both of these groups have the improve\u00ad ment of slum life at heart. But each view is obviously incomplete. And, unfortunately, the bridge between them has been fragile and precarious at best. Thus, housing de\u00ad velopment programs all too frequently ignore human values, and the anti-poverty, educa\u00ad tion and welfare programs all too often fail to combat the depressing effect of the urban environment. No program for helping slum people and rebuilding urban slums can succeed if it focuses exclusively on housing, or on jobs; or on training, or on education, or on wel\u00ad fare, or on any one other single problem. They are all woven together and will have to be overeome together. A fourth aspect of the slum problem is the widespread attitude that poor people should not be allowed to get into the act except as recipients-props and not actors on the stage of life. . \u00b7 That attitude is widely held by a whole array of skeptics. Many reasons can be ad\u00ad vanced in support of it. The simple-and to me compelling-reply is this: that unless slum dwellers can be encouraged to involve themselves in self-help programs that prove to them that what they do can make a dif\u00ad ference, the chances for getting them out of perpetual dependence and moving up the ladder to economic security, self-reliance and dignity are small indeed. This, too, may be a heartbreaking task; for there is a maddening inertia among the downtrodden poor that resists the most con\u00ad certed efforts to generate their involveme .nt and action. But the fact that it is difficult is a poor excuse for not trying. Now around those four principles-private sector involvement, home ownership for low\u00ad er-income fami11es, a coordinated effort to grapple with the whole range of slum prob\u00ad lems, and a new emphasis on self help and personal involvement of the poor-I believe a progressive program \u00b7 for revitalizing our cities can be based. \u00b7 On these principles I have tried to devise a concrete plan. It is ambitious in its scope and pioneering in some of its particulars. I do not pretend that it is the last word on anything. But it is a beginning. I would charter a new, private, non-profit National Home OWnership Foundation to serve three of the essential functions of re\u00ad building present declining areas. The Foundation would have a Loan Fund, financed by the sale of tax-exempt, govern\u00ad ment-guaranteed bonds to private investors or to government. From it loans would be made to local non-profit associations con\u00ad ducting housing rehabilitation programs. With the proceeds of the Foundation loan, the local group would buy up sound but run\u00ad down buildings, contract for their rehab111ta\u00ad tion, and sell them to neighborhood residents who have demonstrated their readiness to accept the responsib1lities of home owner\u00ad ship. The Foundation would also aid the local association in arranging supporting programs to help potential home owners secure basic eaucation and job training, find a job, move up on that job, learn to handle the respon\u00ad .sib111ties of home own.ership-credit buying and money management in particular--and generally begin to take part in activities that help to build a genuine community-out of what was formerly an aggregation of isolated individuals. To ensure that the loan money was used wisely and well-and as a prerequisite for it--the National Foundation woUld provide the local group with the necessary technical assistance in program planning and manage\u00ad ment. Here, if any one provision can be so labelled, is the key provision of my home ownership plan. For the crucial element in making a local community development project work-es\u00ad pecially if the rehabilitation of housing and the making of real estate transactions are involved-is the competent administrator. There are few commodities in such scarce supply. The project administrator cannot just be a speci~list in housing finance. He cannot just be knowledgeable about construction techniques. He cannot just have a rapport with low\u00ad income slum families. He cannot just have contacts with reli\u00ad gious, business, union, and civic leaders and local, state and Federal government agencies. He must be all those things and more. A staggering task? Yes, but an exciting task too. A task fit for pioneers. A task fit for young people like you. For this task demands as well as ordinary competence the qualities so characteristic of youth-idealism, dedication, driving energy, motivation to achieve. No pioneer marching westward toward Cumberland Gap ever confronted such a baf\u00ad fling challenge. And none of you tonight are likely to have such a sparkling oppor\u00ad tunity to grow and build and achieve-and learn to overcome reverses along the way. There are several ways in which you can begin. You can explore a career in the urban de\u00ad velopment field. In the last few years a growing number of universities have created departments or centers of urban studies. The Federal Government has available a limited number of Fellowships for City Plan\u00ad ning and Urban Development. That number should be inCil\"eased, and I wm propose a doubled appropriation to one m1llion dollars annually for that purpose. Under the same Act the Department b! Housing and Urban Development is author\u00ad ized to make matching grants to states for programs in cooperation With universities to train technical and professional people for employment with governmental urban affairs agencies at the local level. Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut has already introduced legislation to expand this au\u00ad thority to permit the training of young peo\u00ad ple and slum \u00b7residents for work in local neighborhood development projects. I sup\u00ad port such broadening legislation, and I will urge the immediate funding of this program, which to date has never been funded by Congress. But the great majority of you will most likely not choose to make a career of urban development. Does that mean you cannot have a hand in shaping the future of today's slum neighborhoods, and creating new oppor\u00ad tunities for people who yearn for the same opportunities most of us so lightly take for granted. Far from it. For today, as never before, young people are getting involved on a purely volunteer basis in projects and enterprises to help others help themselves. \u00b7 In Washington, D.C., hundreds of house\u00ad wives are tutoring slum children. In Lansing, Michigan, hundreds of Michi\u00ad gan State students are doing the same thing. In Indianapolis, over a thousand people have joined the Voluntary Advisory Corps, sponftored ' by the Chamber of Commerce, to help unemployed workers get and keep new jobs. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 4703 In Hartford, some 500 college graduates and professional people contributed to help\u00ad ing potential high school dropouts stay in school and then go on to college and careers. And I could never overlook the time and effort of the many volunteers who have oper\u00ad ated the Call For Action program-through which slum residents can get help with hous\u00ad ing code enforcement-sponsored by my own New Illinois Committee in Chicago. Right here in Philadelphia Reverend Leon Sullivan has started a quiet revolution which has already spread to some 65 American cities-the Opportunities Industrialization Center. Through it Philadelphians of every race, color, or creed who have insuftlclent skills to move up to jobs now open are given the basic education and training they need to start up the ladder that leads to security and success. Rev. Sullivan and ore need the assistance of people like you. You will find OIC's number in the phone book. Just one mlle away from OIC on Lambert street the Interfaith Interracial Councll of the Clergy is making poor people the owners of beautiful four-room homes with oak floor\u00ad ing, mahogany paneling, wrought iron rail\u00ad ings, and tile bath and all new gas kitchens for an incrediblly low $53 a month! How do they do it? You can find out how-and give your invaluable assistance too-by call1ng Father Finley at Our Most Precious Blood parish. Now there are two ways you can personally do battle against the slums. You can make it a career, or you can volunteer to help an organization already active in the field. And there is as yet a third way. It is to begin to shape the policies of the two great poll tical parties to make them more responsive to the needs of urban America. For the fact is unmistakably clear: with the great majority of American voters living in urban areas, the party which most effec\u00ad tively appeals to them with responsible pro\u00ad grams for dealing with urban problems, will be the majority party of America. \u00b7 And I want to say to you right now, that I firmly believe that the Republican Party, over the next few years, is going to become the Nation's majority party again precisely because it is going to do a more creative and effective job of coming to grips with the problems of urban America. I hold that belief for a number of reasons. First, America's cities are in trouble. Since they are in trouble, their people are in the market for change. And receptivity to change is the first great prerequisite for any significant shift in party loyalties. \u00b7 Second, the party long in power-and for most practical purposes the Democratic Party has been in power since 1933-is at a serious disadvantage when it comes to gen\u00ad erating new ideas. When Franklin Roosevelt took otfice in 1933, and again when John F. Kennedy took otfice in 1961, there was a great flood of new ideas and hew directions for national policy. The obvious symbol of that New Frontier spirit of 1961 was the Peace Corps--loaded with bright young men and women who worked enthusiastically day and night to create something new and important. Perhaps equally symbolic, however, is President Johnson turning off the lights of the White House. There is no doubt but what the President is sincerely trying to grapple with the new problems of our age. But the ideas and exuberance that accom\u00ad panied his predecessor's rise to the Presi\u00ad dency are now difficult to find. Instead, one sees on every side in Washington orthodoxy, bureaucracy, ossification , a sort of hardening of the arteries of goverment. Third, by contrast, the Republican Party that emerged so revitalized from the 1966 elections is eager and aggressive, full of zest and sass and vinegar. It is generating new ideas and attracting bright new people. Perhaps some of you saw the Meet the Press program of last month featuring the five new Republican Senators. I won't speak for myself, but I believe the American peo\u00ad ple were deeply impressed with my articulate and forceful freshmen colleagues--Mark Hat\u00ad field of Oregon, Cliff Hansen of Wyoming, Ed Brooke of Massachusetts, and Howard Baker, Jr. of Tennessee. The same applies to many new Republican House members and Governors. And I would hardly come here to the Quaker State and not mention your bright new face in Harrisburg, Governor Ray Shafer, and the great Republican Senator from Penn\u00ad sylvania, who after two productive decades in Congress has never shown a sign of intel\u00ad lectual fatigue-Senator Hugh Scott. The Republican Party today has got the ac\u00ad tion. The Republican Party, and not the Democratic Party, has become the party of ideas. Those with youth and talent and bright ideas to contribute, those who in 1961 flocked to join President Kennedy's New Frontier, are today increasingly looking to the Republican Party for a home. Fourth, the character of the Democratic organizations in most of America's big cities is just not attractive to the public spirited young American whose ideas are so vitally important to the future of the cities. The stale cigar smoke of backroom city politics holds no enchantment for the young people whose ideas and talents our cities must have. But that is all the Democratic Party, in city after city across the country, can offer today. For those reasons, then, I believe that\u00b7the Republican Party has the golden opportunity to win the allegiance of urban America, and especially of its bright young people. The Republican Party is now making a strong new effort to attract young people-\u00ad through what our National Chairman Ray C. Bliss calls \"Opportunities Unlimited\". We must prepare a home for young Americans in the Republican Community, a base from which their ideas can be usefully channeled into the otficial party policy-making ma\u00ad chinery. To fail. to do so would be to forego a potential asset of inestimable value. Once when Henry Clay was Speaker of the House, a notoriously long-winded Congress\u00ad man was delivering a ponderous oration on the House floor. \"I speak for posterity,\" the Congressman thundered. \"Yes,\" said Speak\u00ad er Clay, \"and the gentleman seems resolved to hold the floor until the arrival of his audience.\" So I have spoken my piece to you tonight. It has been a great privilege to come to Villanova and be with you. Thank you so much for your invitation. PROPOSALS FOR PRESIDENT'S COM\u00ad PREHENSIVE PLANNING IN EDU\u00ad CATION COMMENDED BY SEN\u00ad ATOR JENNINGS RANDOLPH Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, among the legislative recommendations that President Johnson has presented to Congress is one in particular to which I invite the attention of my colleagues. Especially meritorious is the proposal to amend title V of the Elementary and Sec\u00ad ondary Education Act of 1965 to author\u00ad ize grants to the States to assist them in establishing programs of educational planning and evaluation. Education continues to be one of the vital concerns of the Nation. Last year our total expenditures for school train\u00ad ing were more than $50 billion. Approxi\u00ad mately half of the people in the United States are directly served by an educa\u00ad tional institution or program of one type or another. The future strength and vitality of our country depends on the quality and direction of the educational opportunities made available to more and more of our citizens. In almost every other sector of our society, a large portion of the expendi\u00ad ture of funds and of effort is invested in planning and evaluation. But in edu\u00ad cation the time, effort, and money in\u00ad vested for planning are minimal in comparison to the overall expenditure. The educational needs of the Nation cannot be met unless the States are able to fully share the responsibility and to acquire competency for rational long\u00ad range planning. This cannot be achieved without financial assistance. If we want the States and the local school boards to provide effective leadership in education, they must be capable of accurately eval\u00ad uating their educational needs, and find\u00ad ing ways to plan and to meet these requirements. I believe the amendments proposed to title V are essential to the improvements we seek in the field of education. In the final analysis, Mr. President, the quality of our schools depends on the \u00b7wisdom and resourcefulness of our local communities and their leaders. And it is here-in the local school district it\u00ad self-that the President hopes to see achieved the kind of improvement in the quality of American education that will be worthy of our most precious re\u00ad source-our children. I urge prompt enactment of this pro\u00ad posal, and, as a member of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Subcommittee on Education, I will support the prin\u00ad ciple of our administration's recom\u00ad mended title V amendments. SENATOR JENNINGS RANDOLPH AND REPRESENTATIVE GEORGE FALLON, CHAffi:MEN OF THE JOINT COMMITI'EE TO CONSIDER THE HIGHWAY DEFERMENT ORDER, REPORT PROGRESS SUF\u00ad FICIENT TO RECESS HEARINGS Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, at the close of the joint hearing today of the Committees on Public Works of the House, and the Senate, Representative FALLON and I made the following statement: Mr. Schultze, with the assurances that you have given us, coupled with the testimony of Secretary Boyd yesterday; and President Johnson's press conference; and based on our desire to support the administration in its fight against inflationary pressures that st111 prevail to a reduced degree; and our belief that the administration is committed to a meaningful highway program, we feel that there is no further need for continued hear\u00ad ings at this time. We would hope that as conditions change, as indicated in the testi\u00ad mony received from you today, Mr. Schultze, you will consult with us on any future efforts in which the highway program is involved in an implementation of Federal fiscal policy. Our concern in these hearings was based on our deep and abiding interest in the Fed\u00ad eral aid program. We realize the serious im\u00ad pact this deferment of funds has had on all segments of the highway industry. We would not have shared our responsi bHi ties as Members of the House of RepTesentatives and the Senate had we not held these hear\u00ad ings. The information you have presented to us and to the public makes for better understanding. Too often necessary actions are misinter\u00ad preted because of a failure of communication. 4704 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 We commend your concern for achieving maximum utilization of the highway con\u00ad struction dollars contributed by millions of highway users throughout the United States. We reiterate that continued consultation beween the executive and legislative branches on these problems of national concern will obviate certain misunderstanding and will contribute to our joint efforts to meet the problems of our Nation and our citizens. The testimony of the administration wit\u00ad nesses during the past two days has an\u00ad swered our most pressing questions. There\u00ad fore the chairmen of the joint committee have agreed to recess these hearings at the call of the chairmen. The record will remain open until March 10 for all witness statements and supple\u00ad mentary material. THE IOU OVERCHARGE Mr. METCALF. Mr. President, a principal inflationary cost in millions of family budgets is the overcharge in the electric bill. This extra consumer cost is not gen\u00ad erally recognized, for several reasons. First, there is a lack of understanding of monopoly pricing. The IOU's--in\u00ad vestor-owned utilities-rates are not established in the marketplace. To de\u00ad termine whether a utility charge is ex\u00ad cessive you compare the \"allowed\" rate of return established by a . State regula\u00ad tory commission with the actual rate of return earned by a utility. Few utilities earn only the \"allowed\" rate. Utility overcharges in many cases are increas\u00ad ing even though the rates are decreasing, because of the sharply decreasing costs of producing and distributing electricity, thanks to interconnections, nuclear gen\u00ad eration, larger plants, technological de\u00ad velopments and because of the failure of state regulatory commissions to regulate. In 1946 the return on invested capital of the investor-owned utilities was 5.6 percent. The lOU's averaged 6.2 percent return on invested capital during the 1959-63 period, -according to Edison Electric Institute, the IOU trade asso\u00ad ciation. The 35 principal electric utili\u00ad ties, which account for about two-thirds of the industry's proflts, averaged an 11.4-percent return on invested capital in 1965, according to Fortune. The elec\u00ad tric utility rate of overcharge is increas\u00ad ing more than the bank rate of interest is increasing. A second reason for the lack of gen\u00ad eral understanding of utility overcharges is the misleading advertising and public relations program of the investor-owned utilities. The utility promoters have done as much for the managers-if not the customers-of the lOU's as Samuel lnsull did when he invented State regu\u00ad lation of electric utilities and had his people help write the laws which make regulation ineffective. Because of this misleading advertising, financed with customers' money: First. The growing overcharge in elec\u00ad tricity bills is believed to be the biggest bargain in the family budget; Second. The Nation's largest, safest monopoly-which enjoys 110 percent of parity or more in good times or bad-is considered a prime example of risky, competitive free enterprise; Third. The electric utilities, through keeping more taxes than they pay, are gratefully cited as the Nation's largest taxpayers, and Fourth. Customer-owned, locally man\u00ad aged power ' systems are considered socialistic, while absentee-ow,ned, proxy\u00ad managed utilities are equated with jun\u00ad ior's lemonade stand and the local mom\u00ad and-pop corner grocery. This remarkable inversion of real life by incessant utility advertising is the biggest hoax since Phineas T. Barnum hoodwinked the public into paying to see his \"Feejee Mermaid,\" contrived of monkey and fish. And it is pertinent to point out that the creator of utility ad\u00ad vertising techniques, Samuel Insull, ''may be called the link between P. T. Barnum and Madison Avenue,\" accord\u00ad ing to the recent biography of Insull which received friendly reviews in the in\u00ad dustry press. Forrest McDonald, \"In\u00ad sull,\" Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1962. The third reason for the lack of un\u00ad derstanding of utility overcharges is the one which I want to discuss in some de\u00ad tail today. It is the mercenary misrep\u00ad resentation of basic utility matters by men who know better. I regret having to make a charge which reflects upon a former high Gov\u00ad ernment official. It is, however, in my considered opinion, essential to sound government to put aside the myths that surround the utility business and begin a discussion based on realities. \u00b7 It is bad enough when utility propa\u00ad gandists misrepresent facts. It is worse when men who have held positions of trust and respect in the National Gov\u00ad ernment become a party to an instru\u00ad ment of deception. Mr. President, I was appalled and sad\u00ad dened to read in a recent issue of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-February 16, pages 3610-3611-a letter written by a former White House assistant, during the Kennedy administration, who for\u00ad merly served on a regulatory commission. The letter was written by Myer Feld\u00ad man to Robert H. Fite, president of Florida Power & Light. Mr. Fite had asked Mr. Feldman, now a Washington attorney, to review legislation introduced in the 89th Congress dealing with ex\u00ad emption of certain utilities from juris\u00ad diction of the Federal Power Commis\u00ad sion. Mr. Feldman prepared for Mr. Fite proposed legislation to exclude the utility from FPC legislation. In his ac\u00ad companying letter, Mr. Feldman wrote Mr. Fite, as follows: No public purpose would be served by transferring jurisdiction (of Florida Power & Light) to the Federal Power Commission. On the contrary, the public would have to pay for unnecessary duplicate surveillance, electric bills would go up instead of down, expenses would increase substantially, and the Company, its customers, and its in\u00ad vestors would be prejudiced. This is clear from the history of the Com\u00ad pany. Over the past decade there have been nine rate reductions, almost one every year. If the original rates, prior to the reductions, had been in effect last year, consumers would be paying over $100 million more for their electricity. This is a tribute to both the Florida commission and the company. Fed\u00ad eral jurisdiction would reverse this trend, for the company would, by its estimates, have to pay between $500,000 and $600,000 a year more to meet the accounting require-ments of the Federal Government. This cost would necessarily be passed to the con\u00ad sumer. Mr. President, in the fir;:;t place, no serious student of regulation can say that Florida electric utilities, especially Florida Power & Light, have been sub\u00ad ject to meaningful regulation, except perhaps in very recent times, in circum\u00ad stances which I shall describe. The chairman of the Florida Public Service Commission testified in 1965, in response to a question by the senior Senator from Wyoming [Mr. McGEE], during hearings on S. 218, that \"the best regulation is little or no regulation.\" An experienced reporter for the Miami Herald, Mrs. Juanita Green, attempted without suc\u00ad cess in 1964 to flnd out from the Florida commission the rate base of Florida Power & Light. She was told, by the di\u00ad rector of the commission's finance de\u00ad partment, that \"where it is, if it still exists, I don't know.\" Utilities, unlike free enterprise business, receive a per\u00ad centage of their rate base or investment. So that sorry state of affairs in Fiorida is comparable to a situation where a county assessor could not show an ordi\u00ad nary taxpayer his assessment. Second. It is pure poppycock to assert, as Mr. Feldman did, that Federal juris\u00ad diction would cause electric bills to increase. The cost of producing and dis\u00ad tributing electricity is steadily decreas\u00ad ing. Monopoly pricing is essentially dif\u00ad ferent from pricing of competitive prod\u00ad ucts or services. Despite slight rate reductions the excess proflts of the lOU's are growing ever larger, because of the cost reductions made possible by re\u00ad gional and now national power grids, nuclear power generation, larger and more efficient plants, and because the savings are not being shared equitably with utility customers. The return on invested capital of Flor\u00ad ida Power & Light was 12.3 percent in 1964. The company's rate of return was one of the most exorbitant in the Na\u00ad tion-8.72 percent, as compared with 7.74 percent in 1961. Had the Florida Public Service Commission kept profits down at the 6.98 percent \"allowed\" rate which it set for the company some years ago, many millions of dollars in overcharges would have remained with the company's customers. The principal rate reduction granted Florida Power & Light's customers re\u00ad sults neither from the initiative of the company nor the initiative of the com\u00ad mission. It stems rather from the fact that the city of Miami, tiring of over\u00ad charges, hired an aggressive utility con\u00ad sultant, and the fact that the Miami Herald decided to cover the utility beat and report on the real world of electric utilities. Mr. President, Mr. Feldman's reference to accounting requirements also deserves comment. Florida Power & Light is one of the many examples of lOU's which presently disregard the reasonable ac\u00ad counting requirements of the Federal Power Commission. Not long ago the FPC requested Florida Power & Light to itemize more than $400,000 in contribu\u00ad tions and other expenses during 1963 which the utility had accounted, con\u00ad trary to regulations, as a lump sum, and February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4705 also, incorrectly, as an operating expense to be borne by the customers. In re\u00ad sponse to the FPC request, the company still did not itemize more than $125,000 in \"public relations,\" \"educational\" and \"donation\" expenditures. Interestingly enough, the company did, when pressed for details, report spending more than $1,000 that year on subscriptions to Pub\u00ad lic Service magazine, a publication which, as the junior Senator from Alaska [Mr. GRUENING] pointed out years ago in \"The Public Pays,\" has been part of the lOU's propaganda transmission system for decades. Public Service magazine is a conglom\u00ad eration of speeches and articles by lead\u00ad ers of the IOU's and of the extremist organizations which the utilities endow, with your and my money. Among the organizations which receive these spe\u00ad cial favors from the IOU's and Public Service magazine are the Southern States Industrial Council-which claims that UNICEF is \"completely Communist dominated'' and that civil rights legis\u00ad lation is Communist inspired, Industrial News Review-the editoral service which distributes to 11,000 editors each week two editorials which praise the investor\u00ad owned utilities, Harding College--which in cooperation with the John Birch Society produces and distributes films and pseudoeducational material to schools and civic organizations, the Foundation for Economic Education\u00ad whose recommended literature is for the most part also found on the recom\u00ad mended reading lists of the John Birsch Society, and the American Economic Foundation-which is the organization of Fred Clark, who has been fronting for the utilities ever since the fight over-the Public Utilities Holding Company Act in the thirties. Let me cite another example of the accounting practices of Florida Power & Light. In 1963 it cosigned with three other Florida IOU's-Florida Power Corp., Gulf Power, and Tampa Electric-an advertisement which put a Communist connotation on the Federal Power Commission's requirement that power companies account for political ads as a nonoperating expense, to be borne by stockholders rather than cus\u00ad tomers. According to this ad: A \"Berlin built in Amer\u00ad ica . . . constructed of subtle and gradual of traditional American free\u00ad doms. And the FPC \"laid the first brick\" by its accounting regulations. When queried concerning this ad, Florida Power & Light told the FPC: The ad was neither reviewed or approved by the chief executive oftlcers of this com\u00ad pany. In fact, our name was included by mistake and consequently this company w111 not participate in the cost of the ad. That was a new twist. The customers of other power companies would pay for the smear ad that bore Florida Power & Light's signature. Mr. President, the performance of Florida Power & Light does no credit to the electric power industry, the Nation's largest. Mr. Feldman's performance is certainly no credit to his background. CXIII--298--Part 4 State commissions have been saddled with impossible jobs and inadequate laws and staffs. We talk of the regulatory lag, but it is the regulatory lapse which should concern State and Federal of\u00ad ficials. The supposedly regulated indus\u00ad tries account for more than one-fifth of all business in this country, and men with knowledge and responsibilities need to examine and update the regulatory process. SIGNING OF THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES BILL. Mr. PELL. Mr. President, nearly a year and half ago, it was my privilege to be present at a unique White House ceremony, the signing of the arts and humanities bill. That was a historic occasion, for it marked the first time in our history that the Federal Government had committed itself to the active sup\u00ad port of artists and writers in our society. I recall very well the moving and elo\u00ad quent words that President Johnson spoke ~t that ceremony: first Chair of Law and of Modem Languages. But more important for our ceremony today is another priority. At William and Mary in 1779 the Fine Arts became a part of the curriculum. This is almost a century before Fine Arts were taught at Harvard or at any other American university. In that year, 1779, the Reverend Robert Andrews was made the \"Professor of Moral Philosophy, the Law of Nature and of Nations, and of the Fine Arts,\" a combination curious to us but not to the 18th century. It is appropri\u00ad ate that this new Fine Arts wing of Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall bear his name. How I wish there were preserved a syllabus of his course or courses, his notes, any scrap of evidence which would enlighten us about this earliest of American experiments in granting to the history of art an academic status.

He concluded that paintings and statuary were \"Too expensive for the state of wealth among us,\" Two PRESIDENTIAL ATTITUDES: JEFFERSON AND JOHNSON ON THE FINE ARTS Lad~es and Gentlemen: It is a great honor to be here today. As a gradu.ate of Harvard I have always taken pride in the belief that my Alma Mater was the first college estab\u00ad lished in North America. It was therefore disconcerting to find that only an Indian massacre prevented Virginia from h.aving a college some eighteen years before Massa\u00ad chusetts. Between 1618 and 1622 at Henrico near Richmond money and land for a uni versity were allocated by the Virginia Com\u00ad pany of London. But in th.at f.atal year, 1622, the ferocity of the Indians annihilated alike parents and future students; whereas in New England the aborigines were milder and the Puritans :flourished. Thus Ha-rvard survived; while Virginia had to wait more than half a century for Wllliam and Mary to be_come the second college in our country. Being only second it tried harder. In\u00ad spired by Thomas Jefferson, William and Mary took American leadership in a number of fields, among them the use of the elective system of study and the establishment of the His conclusion was probably right. We had to walt for the age of the Wideners, the Mellons, the Kresses, to draw on the re\u00ad sources necessary for the great American col\u00ad lections. However, Thomas Jefferson would have felt as little sympathy for the gentle\u00ad men I have mentioned as they would have felt for him. Mr. Jefferson was a versatile genius-unequalled in the history of the United States-but he would have been a wretched museum director I He believed the collecting of art was \"to give a pleasing and innocent direction to accumulations of wealth which would otherwise be employed in the nourishing of coarse and vicious hab\u00ad its.\" \"Coarse and vicious habits,\" indeed! Can you imagine a museum director pointing out to a potential donor that but for his art collecting he would be busy nourishing his coarse and vicious habits? With Thomas Jefferson as Director that vast, marble struc\u00ad ture on Constitution Avenue, which is our National .Gallery of Art, would stm be as empty as the day it was finished. 4706 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 I mentioned John Trumbull and Marla Cosway. The lives of these two painters were closely entwined with Mr. Jefferson's. Trumbull introduced him to Mrs. Cosway, the wife of the miniaturist, and herself an able artist. Mr. Jefferson fell in love. Trumbull acted as go-between. Mr. Jeffer\u00ad son was Minister in Paris, the most rom.a.n\u00ad tic of cities, and he had as his companion a lady of such fascination that two hundred years later I find myself equally in love with her. Judging by their correspondence, which remained unpublished until fairly re\u00ad cently, their affair was short-lived. Only death, however, ended their affection for each other. The letters they exchanged over many years are extraordinarily touching. Maria Cosway was a \u00b7lady who a-ttracted men. In London society she was the sub\u00ad ject of scandalous gossip. Many love affairs were attributed to her. Horace Walpole doubted the paternity of her child. She was supposed to have gone off to Italy with an opera singer. But in the end her redemp\u00ad tion was complete. She ended a career of the gayest immorality as the Headmistress of a girls' school. Her experience must have enabled her to set her pupils on the correct worldly path. She was less successful in setting Mr. Jef\u00ad ferson on the right artistic path. His taste 1n painting remained erratic. He wrote Maria Cosway from Germany, \"At Dussel\u00ad dorf I wished for you much. I surely never saw so precious a collection of paintings. Above all things those of Van der Werff affected me the most. His picture of Sarah Delivering Agar to Abraham is delicious. I would have agreed to have been Abraham though the consequence could have been that I should have been dead five or six thousand years. Carlo Dole! became also a violent favorite. I am so little of a con\u00ad noisseur that I preferred the works of these two authors to the old, faded red things of Rubens. I am but a son of nature, lov\u00ad ing what I see and feel, without being able to give a reason, nor caring much whether there be one. At Heidelberg I wished for you too. In fact, I led you by the hand thro' the whole garden.\" To prefer Van der Werff and Carlo Dolci to Rubens shows the courage of one's con\u00ad victions, but not the benefit of a discerning eye. Mr. Jefferson in this letter indicates that he is more interested in the subject matter of art than in its presentation. This was to be expected. He was living in Paris at a time when the Neo-classicists valued content above form. As he wrote, \"I do not feel an interest in any pencil but that of David.\" His concept of the role of painting and sculp\u00ad ture was the same as David's. Both believed the arts should inculcate virtue, orient the mind toward republican heroes, and foster patriotism . Both believed in an art filled with social content. The avant garde today would find Presi\u00ad dent Jefferson's aesthetic theories totally unacceptable. As far as art is concerned, to use their language, he was \"out of it\"! On the other hand, President Johnson is \"with it\" when he says, art \"flourishes most abun\u00ad dantly when it is really free--when the artist can speak as he wishes and describe the world as he sees it without any oftlcial direction.\" Mr. Jefferson, however, was himself an artist. His belief in the importance of paint\u00ad ing, sculpture, and above all architecture, profoundly affected the new republic. \"His enthusiasm for the arts, he wrote Madison in 1785, was one 'of which I am not ashamed, as its object is to improve the taste of my countrymen, to increase their reputation, to reconcile to them the respect of the world and procure them its praise.'\" Almost two hundred years were to pass before we find again among the sp~eches and writings of our Presidents so positive an affirmation. This enthusiasm for the arts reappears in the address delivered by Presi\u00ad dent Kennedy in 1963 at Amherst. He said: \"I look forward to an America which will steadily raise the standards of artistic ac\u00ad \u00b7complishment and which will steadily en\u00ad large cultural opportunities for all of our citizens. \"And I look forward to an America which commands respect throughout the world not only for its strength but for its clv111zation as well.\" President Johnson has brought to realiza\u00ad tion many of President Kennedy 's hopes. It has not been ea~y. Americans have always been basically utilitarian. It is true, as Mr. Johnson has said, \"We in America have not always been kind to the artists and the scholars who are the creators and the keepers of our vision. Somehow, the scientists al\u00ad ways seem to get the penthouse, while the arts and the humanities get the basement .\" In this I believe Mr. Jefferson was not unlike other Americans. There is reason to think that he too\u00b7 would have put hls sci\u00ad entific tenants in the penthouse and his artistic tenants in the basement. But this is understandable. America in his day was young and had to be practical. As John Adams wrote, \"I m~t study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy .... in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapes\u00ad try and porcelain.\" We have now reached this last generation. Winds of change have blown across our country, These have swept the arts into new directions. The third President and the thirty-sixth President have different views on the Fine Arts. That Mr. Jefferson was a great architect and a dlligent student of the humanities, while Mr. Jahnson is neither, is not the explanation. Instead the change is the product of time and environment. In America in the 18th century painting and sculpture were related to the rural culture of the young Republic; a culture resembling that of Rome in the days of Horace, one of Mr. Jefferson's favorite poets. OUr third President looked on works of art when pri\u00ad vately owned as the amenities of a balanced, harmonious existence such as he enjoyed at Monticello; or when publicly owned as a means of instructing his fellow citizens in the history and virtues of their country. The visual arts today have a greater com\u00ad plexity of purpose. They are related to an urban culture: a culture which at its best is gay, frivolous, sophisticated; at its worst filled with tension and anxiety, with loneli\u00ad ness and despair. _The arts are called upon to stimulate and amuse or to heal and give hope. As Mr. Johnson has said in a recent speech, \"Science can give us goods--and goods we need. But the humanities--art and litera\u00ad ture, poetry and history, law and philos\u00ad ophy-must give us our goals. We have the material power to conquer economic want. Now we need the will to attack the poverty of man's spirit.\" Mr. Johnson has intuitively felt that in art people hope to find an antedate to man's spiritual poverty. Contemporary life has its dreary and monotonous aspects. Existence is more standardized than ever before. Art, on the other hand, is not standardized. It is the free expression of the spirit. It sometimes points out the humor, the charm, the significance underlying our environment. If one Campbell soup can resembles another, then Andy Warhol paints them row upon row with a gloriously mocking, comical ef\u00ad fect. If our super-highways and clover-leafs are monotonous d'Arcangelo and Indiana show that they also contain a hidden beauty. If our cities are stark and lonely, Hopper humanizes them with a girl, her clothes blown against her body. And if we feel alienated, our identity lost, a sculptor like Segal, gives our trivial, meaningless gestures slgnlftcance, makes us feel a part of human\u00ad ity, no longer isolated or alone. Thus art offers a remedy, makes life more bearable in \"our age of clatter and buzz, of gape and gloat,\" to use Winston Churchill's description. Ours is an age when art alone keeps us from living lives not of quiet but of noisy desperation. In Mr. Jefferson's time less of a burden was placed on art. Painters and sculptors were asked only to be good decorators or useful propagandists. They were not explorers of the unconscious, investigators of the nature of vision, searchers for beauty in the ugliness of our environment. Society depended on them less than it does today. In our con\u00ad temporary culture artists have been called upon to perform new and complex functions. Yet the economics of our time make it dlmcult for them to carry out these func\u00ad tions. There are, of course, artists who have become fashionable. They present no prob\u00ad lem. But there are also painters and sculp\u00ad tors who work alone, who see nature not with the eyes of a movement, who create with their own special sensitivity. These are the artists to be pi tied. Too often the shows are closed to them, too often their canvases or statues remain unseen, their work unrecog\u00ad nized. But this does not destroy their inner conviction, often right, that the future will welcome their achievement when they are no longer alive. For such artists some form of subsidy has become necessary. Mr. Johnson is aware of this. Consequently we have the National Foundation on the Arts and the Human\u00ad ities-in my opinion a noble experiment which will play a great role in your future. Doubtless many of those who will study in the building we are dedicating today will sometime or another be affected by this new agency of our Government. Each year the National Endowment for the Arts will dis\u00ad tribute millions of dollars in grants to painters, sculptors, musicians, dancers, museums, art centers, theatres, etc. Mr. Jefferson would have been astounded at this governmental generosity. Our third Presi\u00ad dent was not ashamed of this enthusiasm for the arts, but he saw no necessity for their subvention. He believed in patronage not subsidy. Today the situation has changed; and though there are more consumers of art, yet in relation to the number of artists, there are fewer discerning patrons. The intellectual climate has also changed. In the 18th century art was taken for granted; it required no justification. With time we have grown more self-conscious; we are always reminding ourselves of the importance of the Fine Arts. In this regard President Johnson has spoken with great eloquence. \"In the long history of man, countless empires and nations have come and gone. Those which created no lasting works of art are reduced today to short footnotes in history's catalogue. Art is a nation's most precious heritage. For it is in our works of art that we reveal to ourselves, and to others, the inner vision which guides us as a nation. And where there is no vision the people perish.\" These are noble words. The building we are dedicating today is proof that the Com\u00ad monwealth of Virginia believes them to be true words. The State has erected this su\u00ad perb edifice with studios for eculpture, paint\u00ad ing, the graphic arts, architecture, and pho\u00ad tography. There will also be lecture rooms and seminar rooms for the teaching of the history of art, and space for an audio-visual library containing thousands of photographs and slides. The College of William and Mary for 188 years has placed its stamp of approval on the teaching of the Fine Arts, and this new building shows that the leadership estab\u00ad lished in the 18th century in this discipline has not been lost. This is a clear affirmation February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4707 that in the second oldest college in the United States the Board of Visitors, the Pres\u00ad ident, and the Faculty, believe that a knowl\u00ad edge of art will strengthen men's faith in humane values, and also that such knowl\u00ad edge will give\u00b7 some of you assembled here this morning the power to convey your inner vision in visible form. Thank you. THE CONSULAR CONVENTION AND THE EAST-WEST TRADE BILL\u00ad DANGEROUS BRIDGES Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, last week I suggested to the Senate that any decision on the consular convention with Russia be\u00b7 deferred until an opportunity had been had to consider all the other aspects of the President's program to \"build bridges\" to the Communist countries. It was and is my contention that this consular convention and the East-West trade bill, the treaty on the peaceful uses of outer space, and perhaps other measures which may be proposed are parts of a single large package which should all be studied together. Possibly they will stand or fall together as a unit; at least, they should all be studied as a unit, so that we may clearly understand to what further steps we may be led if we now approve some one of these proposals. One of the favorite themes of this ad\u00ad ministration has been that the expan\u00ad sion of our trade relations with the Communist countries of Eastern Europe can be a force in easing world tensions, breaking up the control of Communist Russia over its smaller neighbors, and leading all those countries to reject the dogmas of Communist economics. It is an appealing, attractive, in fact seductive idea. It is pleasant to believe that we can somehow reform our ene\u00ad mies-peacefully-and at the same time make some money for ourselves. It would be nice if it were possible. Unfortunately, there is never any easy way out of a hard problem. A recent article entitled \"Dangerous Bridges,'' published in Barron's weekly, should bring us back to earth. In this article it is shown that the administration's bridgebuilding program is a construc\u00ad tion of tissue paper, based on faulty premises and :flimsy logic. Spokesmen for the administration speak of trade, but what they mean is aid. As the article well points out, the nub of the issue is U.S. credits, not U.S. aid. Increase of our normal trade can\u00ad not help the Communist bloc much, since there is little they produce that we need. The real meat of the coconut is in the tendency toward longer and longer trade credits. The article points out that the Com\u00ad munists have already built up a trade debt to foreign creditors, chiefly Western Europe, of $2 billion. Our own Export\u00ad Import Bank will give credit guarantees of as much as 5 years in some cases, cer\u00ad tainly much too long a period to be considered normal short-term trade credit in any sense; and the pressure is now on from our foreign competitors to push these credits to 10, 12, or 15 years. Credits of such a duration cannot be called trade financing; rather, they are a form of subsidy. Furthermore, this foreign aid-no other term is appropriate-instead of weaning those countries away from Com\u00ad munist economics, has rather permitted their ruling regimes to avoid the neces\u00ad sity for change. The failure of Com\u00ad munist centralized economic control has been apparent throughout the bloc, or would have been without the financial strength borrowed from the West. They have used our money to strengthen their control over their own people, and to fight off the demands for reform from within. All these facts are demonstrated with convincing reasoning and a wealth of detail in the article which I ask to have printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: [From Barron's, Jan. 16, 1967] DANGEROUS BRIDGES--PROPOSALS FOR ExPANDED EAsT-WEST TRADE REST ON SHAKY GROUND (NoTE.-In last week's State of the Union Message, President Johnson urged new meas\u00ad ures to expand U.S. trade with the Soviet bloc. In the accompanying article, Brutus Coste and Hal Lehrman, authorities on Com\u00ad munism in Europe, make a convincing case against such proposals.) Among the articles of faith in Washing\u00ad ton, none is more hotly professed than the doctrine of \"Bridges to the East.\" It holds that American trade can seduce the coun\u00ad tries of the Soviet bloc away from Socialist rigidities towartl a capitalist-style economy, with East-West amity and possibly even political freedom at the end of the line. This belief began growing earnestly in 1964, when signs of \"independence\" from Moscow became visible in State Department tele\u00ad scopes aimed at puppet Red Rumania. \"So naive that it borders on the gro\u00ad tesque,\" said the ofllcial Slovak Communist newspaper \"Pravada,\" in a typical comment on the notion that the carrot of American machinery and technology might convert the Marxist donkey. But such Communist can\u00ad dor failed to daunt U.S. policymakers, per\u00ad haps because the scom.ng was restricted to local consumption in local languages, while Red broadcasts aboard, declarations by bloc leaders and informal talks with foreign dip\u00ad lomats, reporters, and stray businessmen hinted of native nationalism, economic lib\u00ad eralism, evolution toward freedom and other hopeful developments. President Johnson pointed his first \"bridge of friendship\" eastward in the summer of 1964, when thousands of American commod\u00ad ities were delicensed for export to Rumania, which also was promised delivery of whole industrial plants with Export-Import Bank financing. Last October the President held out the prospect o! a whole network o! bridges to the Red countries, including the Soviet Union: \"Our task is to achieve a rec\u00ad onc111ation with the East--a shift from coexistence to peaceful engagement. We seek healthy economic and cultural relations with the Communist states.\" Specifically, he announced: 1) clearance for the Export\u00ad Import Bank to guarantee commercial cred\u00ad its for Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria; 2) the Bank's readiness to finance export of American equipment to a large Soviet auto plant which Italian Fiat will build; 3) imminent decontrol of certain commodities for sale to East Europe. Six days later some 400 items previously barred !rom export to the Soviet bloc with\u00ad out special license--including metal manu\u00ad factures, machinery and chemical prod\u00ad ucts--were expunged from the Commerce Department's Commodity Control List. Since then Congress has confirmed Mr. Johnson's authority to produce Export-Im\u00ad port Bank guarantees of credit for \"any Communist country ... when the Presi\u00ad dent determines such guarantees in the na\u00ad tional interest.\" The U.S. has raised to em\u00ad bassy rank its legations in Bulgaria and Hungary (the latter is still the refuge of Roman Catholic Primate, Joseph Cardinal Mindszenty, hiding there from the Russians since the Red Army shelled the 1956 Buda\u00ad pest uprising into rubble. Under Secretary of State Eugene M. Rostow has urged a joint effort by the free world's industrial powers and the U.S. for \"peaceful economic engage\u00ad ment\" with East Europe. Awaiting the 90th\u00b7 Congress are two Administration \"bridge\" bills, one a Convention allowing the Soviets to establish a series of consula.tes here, the other an East-West Trade Relations Act ex\u00ad tending most favored nation treatment to those European Communist states not yet so favored (Yugoslavia and Poland already are). Disquiet has been expressed by an occa\u00ad sional Senator or Representative, an edi\u00ad torial or column, and a few economists and businessmen. By and large, however, industry has shared the enthusiasm for in\u00ad creasing East-West trade. When the U.S. Government set up recent business missions to Rumania, Poland, Bulgaria and Hungary, the Commerce Department crowed that \"we had no lack of candidates anxious to participate.\" A high-speed October tour of East Europe sponsored by \"Time\" had a roster reading like a Who's Mostly Who in U.S. Business and Finance. Formidable academic support for \"peace\u00ad ful engagement\" has come from Zbigniew Brzezinski, a ranking specialist on East Eu\u00ad rope and inventor of the term. Brezezinski, now on loan from Columbia University to the State Department's Policy Planning Council, is credited with having furnished the main intellectual inspiration for the idea of prodding satellite and Soviet \"evolution\" through wide economic and other stimuli. Roost concepts in his \"Alternative to Parti\u00ad tion\" (Council on Foreign Relations, 1965) were borrowed by the Johnson and Rostow speeches cited above. Despite the near-unanimity, however, American parents, taxpayers and entrepre\u00ad neurs have cogent reasons for withholding their hurrahs. One is that Moscow began pushing bridges long before Washington. Premier Nikolai Bulganin said in 1955: \"Everything new being created by world science and technology must be studied, technical information improved, relations with research establishments and scientists of foreign countries expanded.\" Party boss Nikita Khrushchev in 1956: \"The task is to pursue a vigorous policy of improving rela\u00ad tions with the U.S., developing trade and expanding contacts.\" Premier Aleksei Kosy\u00ad gin in September 1965: \"We must make wider use of foreign technology.\" No bones were made about the purpose, in Bulganin's words: \"The struggle for technical progress is the struggle !or the bUllding of a com\u00ad munist society.\" A second good reason not to be over-awed by a proposition just because most policy\u00ad makers and experts agree on it is that recent history bulges with consensus that went wrong. To cite a few exploded axioms: we can trust Joseph Stalin's wartime pledges on free elections in East Europe; let's let the Red Army get to Berlin first; the Chinese Reds are agrarian reformers; Fidel Castro is a patriotic anti-Communist; Arab unity and Egypt's Nasser are irresistible forces which the u.s. should appease and support. One way to test the bridges proposition would be to examine some of the economic \"facts\" on which its widespread acceptance rests: 1) satellite defiance (especially Ru\u00ad mania's) has thwarted a Soviet drive for bloc integration; 2) satel11te economic reforms 4708 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 are trending toward a Western structure; 3) another mark of the satellites' growing emancipation is their increased trade with the West; and 4) satellltes have actually begun exploiting the USSR, reversing their previous condition of servitude. Upon examination, these assumptions look more like fiction than fact. The evidence suggests instead that Moscow is the chief beneficiary of bloc non-integration; that satelllte reforms have failed to shake the basic centralism of Communist management, leaving the concept, of a market-oriented economy as remote as ever; that the Soviets have upped their trade with the satellites as fast as the West; and that the USSR 1s \u00b7 getting more economic mileage, not less, out of East Europe since the dawn of so-called Red nationalism. The data indicate further that increase of normal U.S. trade can't help the bloc much. East Europe exports little that we need or could accept in payment. The nub of the issue is U.S. credits, not U.S. trade. And U.S. credits given freely, without a Com\u00ad munist quid pro quo, w111 defeat our purpose. The Reds' war-emphasis allocation of in\u00ad vestment, and their adoration of an inflexible god called The Plan, have hobbled their eco\u00ad nomic development with producer muddle and consumer crisis. Their only way out is via genuine reform. They must face up to decentralization, higher rewards for labor, greater initiatives for management, real adaptation of Western market techniques (not merely of U.S. technology) and a shift from armaments to better-quality exports. But this they will not do unless compelled, because such reforms would reduce the Party's totalitarian power. Yet only this, and nothing else, can build a sturdy bridge. There 1s a chance if we use the barga..ining power \u00b7of our credits which the bloc so desperately needs. There is a second chance if we abstain, and the bloc is forced to adjust by its own internal stresses and (in satelllte territory at least) by the necessities of population discontent. There is no chance whatever, if we subsidize the regimes as they stand. LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE To justify these conclusions it will be use\u00ad ful to look hard at the evidence behind them. Consider, first, the theory that plucky Ru\u00ad mania prevented the Soviets from integrating the bloc's economies. A typical statement of the theory-with an air of absolute verity\u00ad is J. W. Fulbright's passing reference in a Senate speech that the Rumanians had \"de\u00ad fied the Russians in refusing to subordinate their economy to a Soviet-sponsored program for joint economic development of the So\u00ad viet bloc . . . (and in) undertaking to strengthen (Rumania's) economic independ\u00ad ence by broadening their industrial base.\" The bridge-building chairman of the For\u00ad eign Relations Committee was saying that the Soviets had tried to impose a so-called \"socialist division of labor\" on Comecon\u00ad the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, East Europe's answer to the Marshall Plan. Each Comecon member was to specialize in what was best for the bloc rather than for itself; all the satellites obeyed-except Ru\u00ad mania, a \"defiance\" which wrecked the So\u00ad viet design. But the truth is that Comecon integration was wrecked by the region's built-in eco\u00ad nomic confusions, which made a \"socialist division of labor\" simply impossible. More\u00ad over, Rumania was only one of several mem\u00ad bers which insisted on \"broadening their in\u00ad dustrial base\" instead of serving as sources of raw materials. Foremost and decisive among such recalcitrant members was the USSR. West Europe could achieve an operating Common Market because the area possessed systems of adjustB~ble internal tariffs, con\u00ad vertible currencies, an infra-structure of in\u00ad dependent economic units competing under fairly equal terms and a reasonably free play of market forces. East Europe could not in\u00ad tegrate because it traded inside itself by barter instead of money; had no independent economic units, no solid currencies and no internal tariffs to adjust; and was entirely innocent of competition. Integration might still have been possible if Comecon could figure out objectively which member might produce what item at what cost for equal quality, and make assignment of tasks accordingly. But this was unattain\u00ad able in the area's accounting nightmare of artificial money rates and non-economic State-manipulated \"costs\" beyond the reach of rational audit. ANGRY DEBATE Sov.iet economic journals have been angrily debating for three years just how production cost should be defined. Rumanian money is a normal example of the bloc's currency chaos: the lei's official rate for foreign trade is six to the dollar; for individual remittances abroad it is 12; for foreign tourists 18; for Rumanian tourists 30; official Rumanians abroad have to pay back 60 lei for every un\u00ad accounted dollar; the lei's real purchasing power, meanwhile, is 25 to 1. Out of the horse's mouth (\"Hospod ,arske Noviny,\" economic review of the Czechoslo\u00ad vak Communist Party's Central Committee, July 22, 1966) has come the revelation that Comecon's only worthwhile \"multilateral co\u00ad ordination\" has been a mere \"exchange of in\u00ad formation,\" and this only to \"pinpoint the main problems\" in any planning to be done \"after 1970\"! The review goes on to lament that \"Comecon members still face one an\u00ad other as closed economic units.\" Can believers in bridges glean more com\u00ad fort from a second canon in their credo, the one which professes that Wes.tern aid has in\u00ad spired, Sind will continue to inspire, a gradual f8iding-away of Communism through eco\u00ad nomic reform in the Western image? Washington considers Rumani.a the like\u00ad liest candidate for such liberalization. So it is curious that Rumania stands last in line among the satellites on even minimal change. A full year after U.S. commitment to the Rumaiiian bridge, Communist chief Nicolai Ceausescu (in July 1965) informed his Party Congress that no reform would occur; he stipul8ited that decentralization of State con\u00ad trols-the key to meaningful change-\"is not Rumania's way of doing things.\" \u00b7 CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER It is curious that the \"rebellious\" idea of modifying the totalitarian economic struc\u00ad ture also was invented by Soviet Russians. Nikita Khrushchev was the first, gingerly, to attempt decentralization, in 1957. In the early 'Sixties, Kharkov University Professor Y. Liberman began his daring advocacy of market-economy concepts like profitability and managerial initiative. Liberman is the basic text for the debate flourishing ever since in Soviet and satellite (except Ruma\u00ad nian) economic circles. Khrushchev tried for geographical decon\u00ad trol by replacing 10 central and 15 republic industrial ministries with 104 regional eco\u00ad nomic councils (Sovnarkhozy). His an\u00ad nounced purpose was to spur local economic flexibility, but the real aim was to strengthen Khrushchev's provincial Party henchman against his opponents in the Moscow bu\u00ad reaucracy. Weakened in the CUban-missile confrontation, Khrushchev was compelled by his critics in 1963 to accept a. Supreme Sovnarkhoz, which brought the reins back to Moscow. After his down! all, the regional councils were suppressed. Some modification of the Command Econ\u00ad omy (though far short o! effective) was allowed in 1965. Managers got the right to discharge unproductive workers, but no say in distribution of plant production. A big\u00ad ger chunk of \"profits\" was left to the indJ-_ vidual enterprise, but no curb was placed on the arbitrary pricing system which operates independently of supply, demand or true cost and makes profit meaningless. The slow-grinding three-tier administrative structure--state Planning Commission (Gosplan) over Industrial Ministries over Individual Enterprise-remained. As noted in the U.S. Information Agency's bimonthly \"Problems of Communism,\" the \"reform measures do not even begin to eliminate the fundamental deficiencies of Soviet eco\u00ad nomic management.\" Similar defects are rampant among the satellites. Despite much talk and some patchwork nowhere (except Yugoslavia) has any dent been made on the two major ob\u00ad structions: know-nothing control of econom\u00ad ic decision by the Red political apparatus, and management according to Marxist prej\u00ad udice, rather than according to the market\u00ad place. GLUTTING THE WAREHOUSES Thus it was possible, at the Zabrze-Zakr\u00ad zow Metal Works (as reported by the Polish press), for an unusually alert plant director to notice that demand for large refrigerators was dropping and a shortage in small ones rising; for him and his workers' council to recommend that next year's plan should in\u00ad crease output of smaller models 70% at the expense of big models; for the far-away cen\u00ad tral planners to reject this and order more big models than the preceding year, on grounds that small units would require extra labor and some overtime pay, thereby upset\u00ad ting the indices for Jobs and wages alre8idy concocted by the Ministry. So the big units were inexorably manufactured-to Join some 60,000 unsold units already glutting the local \u00b7warehouses. This characteristic satellite example in Poland dates not from 1950 but from 1965- 66. It suggests that, after years of ballyhoo and change, things remain very much the same. On decentralization, the much-ad\u00ad vertised reforms have tended to restrict the top echelon of the Command Economy to long-range strategy, leaving tactical decisions to a lower level: \"Trusts\" in Czechoslovakia, \"Industrial Associations\" People's Enterprises\" in East Ger\u00ad many, and so forth. The exiled Polish economist Michael Gam\u00ad arnikow, a brllliant student of satellite eco\u00ad nomics, has analyzed the aberrations of these agencies in the magazine \"East Europe\" (July 1966). They are a cross between cartel, com\u00ad bine and holding company, controlling the finances and administration of component enterprises, their targets and production. Being smaller than the old bureaucratic units, their deluge of directives is less tor\u00ad rential, but they merely interpose still an\u00ad other institution into the superstructure. Appointable and fireable by the Minister, the Trust Director reports to him, preserving the old political \"transmission belt.\" Top Trust positions are mainly filled by people from the old apparatus. As one satellite journalist has put it, \"Only the name of the institutions on the door has changed. The persons inside, their habits and atti\u00ad tudes, remain the same.\" CLING TO THEIR POWER Some variations of a limited free-price system are being introduced requiring enter\u00ad prises to pay some attention to what the market, i.e. the consumer, wants. But there is small sign that the central planners are ready to make these valid by yielding or re\u00ad ducing their arbitrary rule over production costs and profit. They cling to their power to fix prices of raw materials, semifinished products, fuel and power, the size of total payroll and individual wages, the wholesale and retail prices of finished goods. For authentic profitability, price increases would be inescapable in the Communist sys\u00ad tems. Production costs would have to rise if only because interest would have to be February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4709 paid on capital for the first tim~ and sub\u00ad sidies reduced or ended. Nevertheless, not one of the published East European economic blueprints contemplates any real compen\u00ad sation in higher personal earnings. Under\u00ad paid labor and exploited peasants (subject to arbitrary low prices for their produce) would remain the chief sufferers. So long as the State dominates all the other production costs, managers trying for a better profit per\u00ad formance would have little room to maneuver except by discharging superfluous workers. (Experimenting cautiously with higher wages and reduced work-force in a few plants, the Soviets were amazed to discover that labor productivity soared by 31% when 7% of the workers were dismissed.) ARE THEY UNLIKELY? Why are such forms unlikely? Mobility of labor, for one thing, raises the specter of political contamination. Consumed-goods production, for another, takes capital away from rockets, moon probes, heavy industry, guns. Surrender of production and invest\u00ad ment controls deprives the Party faithful of jobs and strips the Party of influence. So would the necessary closing of profitless en\u00ad terprises, many of them huge status symbols built during the Stalin era and maintained only by State coverage of their deficits. Na\u00ad tipnwide services like housing-now pro\u00ad vided at nominal rents-would have to be charged at cost plus. All this would bring social-and potentially political--disturb\u00ad ance. Confronted by such menace, the Red re\u00ad gimes are marking time with half-meas\u00ad ures--and peering westward for rescue with\u00ad out risk or obligation. Even where, as in Czechoslovakia, 1,300 inefficient enterprises were shut down in 1964-65 and the abolltion of another 1,400 is projected for 1966-70, the net result is considered virtually nil by local observers (\"Procrastination as a Planning Principle,\" in \"Prague Reporter,\" July 16, 1966). \"It will be impossible,\" says the Po\u00ad lish weekly \"Polytyka\" (August 8, 1966) \"to lead our economy into clear water without correcting the price and wage structure or, to put it bluntly, without introducing such a structure, because there has been no such thing in our economy. . . .\" Another p1llar beneath the bridges policy is that the rise of satell1te trade with the West reflects East Europe's gradual emanci\u00ad pation from the Soviet Union. Ergo, Wash\u00ad 'lngton argues, stm larger trade means still larger emancipation. GOT THERE FIRST Once more it must be reported that the Russians got there first with the idea. In June 1958 the Soviet government formally proposed increased trade to the U.S., offering substantial orders for American equipment (if we would arrange the credits) to advance a multibillion-dollar expansion of the Soviet cheinical industry. The following January, Anastas Mikoyan, as Soviet Deputy Premier, journeyed to Washington specially to request removal of trade restrictions and grant of large long-term credits. He got a short an\u00ad swer then, but his arguments and his shop\u00ad ping bag have been dusted off by present U.S. advocates of business deals with Com\u00ad munism. It must also be noted that satell1te trade with the free world has been developing at no faster rate than Soviet trade with the free world--or satellite trade with the Soviets. Rumania's non-Communist trade went up from 27% of its entire foreign trade in 1960 to 35% in 1965, a rise of eight percentage points. In approximately the same period the USSR's trade with non-Communists went up seven points, from 29% in 1960 to 36% in 1964. From whom was the USSR eman\u00ad cipating itself? During the same time, Poland, whose emancipation we have long been overtly fos- r. taring by trade concessions and economic aid, actually cut down its business with the West from 43% to 39%. Meanwhile, satel\u00ad lite trade with the USSR, which East Europe was supposed to be rejecting in its turn west\u00ad ward, rose from 37% in 1960 to 40% in 1964, the latest year available for full comparative data. Rumania stood third-highest among the six satellites in her level of exchanges with the USSR. This hardly sustains the thesis that Rumania is spearheading a West\u00ad ern orientation. In some cases the West's increase in a sat\u00ad ellite's trade does amount to more than the West's increase in trade with the USSR. Invariably the difference represents the value of Western credits. In other words, the West pays for such increases. Western Eu\u00ad rope and Japan have been easier on credits to the satellites than they have to the So\u00ad viets. The titillating thing is that Moscow has not resented such discrimination. Re\u00ad cently released figures on 1965 Rumanian trade with Western Europe may tell why. Thanks to credits, Rumania's unfavorable balance of trade with the six Common Mar\u00ad ket and the Outer Seven countries reached 490 Inilllon lei ($82 million at the foreign\u00ad trade exchange rate). By eloquent coinci\u00ad dence, this was almost the identical figure (495 mlllion lei) for Rumania's favorable balance with the Red bloc. It represented a credit from Rumania to her Comecon part\u00ad ners in their barter economy. Thus, in\u00ad directly, but effectively, Western credits had been transferred by Rumania to the other Communist states, with the USSR getting the usual lion's share. Moreover, because the Soviets were continuing their notorious practice of charging more than world prices for Russian exports to Rumania and of pay\u00ad ing less for imports from Rumania, Western credits were also fattening Rumania for fur\u00ad ther exploitation by the USSR. Despite such p1llage, the notion lately has grown current that the Soviet Union now is being exploited by East Europe, rather than the other way around. The satellites, it ap\u00ad pears, get world-market prices from Russia for their inferior machinery, whtle paying \"below cost\" prices for Soviet food and raw materials. This view, very satisfying to mem\u00ad bers of the satellite-emancipation cult, de\u00ad rives its inspiration from Russian econoinic journals. OVERCHARGES SATELLITES Actually, as dist1lled by exiled Estonian economist Aleksande \u00b7\u00b7 Kutt from the official Soviet annual survey of USSR foreign trade, Russia collected .an extra $12.7 billion from the satellites in a single decade by over\u00ad charging and under-paying between 1955 and 1964. Instead of diminishing, this loss to East Europe has been on a mounting scale, from $503 m1llion in 1955 to $2,251 milllon in 1964, the latest year officially recorded in full. For 1965, Soviet figures specifically avail\u00ad able on crude oil exports show the satellites still being charged more than the USSR's West European customers: Czechoslovakia had to pay 18.06 rubles ($20.07) per metric ton; Poland 17.11 rubles, East Germany 15.32-while Austria got the same ton for 10.98 rubles and Italy for 7.93 rubles. The 1965 price to the Czechs was 127% higher than to the Italians. The myth that the satellltes suddenly have begun exploiting the USSR is more than a Soviet effort to cover up chronic extortion. It provides a smokescreen of indignation for a new Russian drive to exact st111 higher prices from the captive nations for Soviet raw materials. These prices are to be based on production cost plus. Though above world level, the exorbitant charges previously levied on the satellites st111 do not make Soviet ex\u00ad ports profitable. But this is due to the in\u00ad efficient and uneconoinic Soviet procedures which swell production costs. :! -FORCED LOANS In June 1966 the authoritative \"Voprosi Ekonomiki\" summoned the industrialized satellites to invest in Soviet extractive indus\u00ad tries if they wanted to continue getting raw materials. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany promptly agreed to give the USSR such loans. Soviet domination of East Eur\u00ad ope's economy will only be strengthened if Western financing speeds industrialization in underdeveloped Rumania and Bulgaria. The more these require Soviet raw materials, the greater the ;3oviet bargaining power over them will be. Thus four major economic props beneath the emancipation bridges have the solidarity of jello. There is also reason to suspect that even the traffic over the proposed bridges is radically not as described by White House, State, Commerce and other promotional U.S. agencies. The Administration has specifically ruled out anything strategically useful: \"In no case,\" according to the State Department, \"does our policy permit trade with Com\u00ad munist countries in war materials and other strategic items.\" True, no U.S. bombs, mis\u00ad siles, tanks or other Inilitary goods have been sold direct to the Reds. But what about the so-called \"gray area\" items.\" These are commodities or know-how which can be belllcose or pacific in application, depending on the good faith of the recipient. The Administration must consider Red good faith to be impeccable. Gray items get li\u00ad censed for export when a \"deterinination\" is made they will be used for \"peaceful pur\u00ad poses.\" Government spokesmen-among them, Assistant Secretary of Commerce Alex\u00ad ander B. Trowbridge, in a speech to the Na\u00ad tional Foreign Trade Council Convention on November 2 publicly congratulate them\u00ad selves that more and more such goods are being approved whenever \"demonstrated to us that the order is reasonable and necessary for the civilian economy.\" This has been going on \"for some years\" with Trow\u00ad bridge rejoiced; \"since 1964\" with Rumania; and \"more recently with other countries of Eastern Europe and the USSR.\" He added that the U.S. was also now okaying \"some types of commodities and technology which we were not approving to any of them a few years ago.\" Among gray shipments, listed by Congress\u00ad man Glenard R. Lipscomb (R., Calif.) in a speech to the House on October 17, are: know\u00ad how to build a Soviet plant for glycerol, used in explosives; metal-cutting machinery to Bulgaria for ball bearings; piston-making equipment Rumania; an aluininum-tub\u00ad ing Inill for Czechoslovakia; steel Inills and rotary combustion engines for East Germany; a cheinical factory for Poland; radiation instruments and airplane navigational equip\u00ad ment for Hungary. RANDOM SAMPLING This is a random sampling from hundreds of war-useful items licensed: a list just for part of 1966 covers two full columns of small type in the Congressional Record. All are undoubtedly employable in peace, but easily convertible to war. One must conclude that Washington believes either that a Com\u00ad munist proinise is as good as gold or that the risk of our troops somewhere getting hurt by a gray item turned black is justified by the boost which that item might have given a Communist economy. Communist pledges never to detour stra\u00ad tegic goods from \"civ111an\" purposes would be dubious enough if the Red bloc were cur\u00ad rently on its best behavior. But right now all its members are flagrantly helping the Vietcong war effort. Just in the past 12 months, Soviet ships have unloaded at least 50 cargoes at the North Vietnam port o! Haiphong. Moscow Radio (in Ha!lp,bJong wharves 4710 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 28, 1967 crammed with crates of equipment \"from So\u00ad viet and Czechoslovak factories.\" After a personal inspection trip to Vietnam, Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (who never\u00ad theless still advocates bridges) officially re\u00ad ported the Vietcong was getting \"full and firm support\" especially from the Soviet Union, Poland and Rumania-the two satel\u00ad lites still regarded by Mr. Trowbridge as notably trustworthy. East German, Bul\u00ad garian and other satellite chiefs regularly reaffirm their direct aid to \"the Vietnamese people's heroic defense against American im\u00ad perialist aggression: DEADLY WALLOP An item need not even be \"gray\" 1n the strategic sense to pack a deadly wallop. The Vietcong transport for its guerrillas, weapons and supplies is donated largely by the Red block. Rumanian and Czechoslovak trade agreements with North Vietnam include ve\u00ad hicles; said Prague Radio (again only for internal broadcast): \"We shall deliver .. machines and equipment, means of trans\u00ad portation.\" Yet, with Congressional approval, U.S. tax\u00ad payer money is being funneled through the Export-Import Bank to finance American equipment comprising 75% of the installa\u00ad tions in the Soviets' Fiat-planned, $887 mil\u00ad lion auto plant, expected to produce 600,000 cars annually. As these roll off the line, it will be child's play to metamorphose them out of their \"civilian\" innocence. Petroleum is another peace-loving com\u00ad modity with a mortal kickback. Soviet oil dumping on non-Communist market~, to acquire foreign exchange for the USSR s in\u00ad dustrial build-up, has been noted. This drive, also aimed at making under-developed African and Asian countries dependent on the Soviet by displacing Western oil sup\u00ad pliers, became so \u00b7clearly perilous that the State Department two years ago is\u00ad sued an alert about it. A National Petroleum Council report (sponsored by the U.S. In\u00ad terior Department) said that Soviet-bloc oil exports \"furthers Communist political objec\u00ad tives, (with) penetration especially marked in western Europe\"; the Council warned that \"Western equipment and technology would enhance the Soviet's ability to produce, re\u00ad fine and export oil.\" Yet one of the first moves in the Administration gambit for Ru\u00ad mania's \"independence\" was a 1964 license to help set up an oil refinery installation there with capacity of one million tons an\u00ad nually. Since then there has been a steady stream of approvals for petroleum drilling and oil and gas production equipment. The real Red dilemma is how to pay for U.S. skills and equipment. They can pay only by borrowing. Not short-term credits, which lower the boom quickly, but long-term. Ultimately the logic of the bridge policy must compel such credits in bulk. Critics of the Administration see this as the most pernicious aspect of the program. The Communists already have accumulated a cozy $2 billion commercial debt, largely in West Europe. Industrial sales approved or executed for Rumania are backed by five\u00ad year credit guarantees to U.S. business from the Export-Import Bank. The President now has congressional authority, at his dis\u00ad cretion in \"the national interest,\" to com\u00ad mand the Bank's support for more of the same with the entire bloc. His Special Com\u00ad mittee on East-West trade deliberately ad\u00ad vised him that \"trade with Communist countries should not be subsidized.\" But this is what we are ready to do. FORM OF SUBSIDY A long-term credit to a Communist country is a form of subsidy, especially in the political sense. Five years is not \"normal\" short or medium term. Ninety days is normal when Western countries trade with each other, or six months, or possibly a year. The five\u00ad year term was originally a limit: the 1934 Berne Agreement pledged export credit in-stitutions not to guarantee commercial credit for a longer period. But the U.S. has come to accept five years not as a limit but as normal. So far, the U.S. has admittedly been urg\u00ad ing other suppliers to restrict their bloc cred\u00ad its to five years, correctly contending that anything more is not trade but aid. But, in the context of the Administration's overall thinking, this clearsightedness is sure to dim. Meanwhile Japan and her West Eu\u00ad ropean competitors, in their race for Com\u00ad munist orders, have escalated to 7, 12 and even 15 years. The justification given is that a credit's duration should match normal amortization for complete factories and other major equipment like ocean-going vessels. Ironically, though these interminable credits are called good business, and the Communists good risks because they have not defaulted to date, in no case w111 the Western businessman stir without a gov\u00ad ernment guarantee of his risk. THREE ALTERNATIVES Opponents of the bridges policy see three alternatives on long-term U.S. credits: to grant the credits unconditionally; to with\u00ad hold them absolutely; to pay them out grad\u00ad ually, each one in exchange for a specific concession leading gradually toward a gen\u00ad uinely favorable change in East-West rela\u00ad tionships. The Administration seems intent on the first choice. The critics find merit in the second; recommend the third; and consider the first potentially ruinous to the econom\u00ad ic and political interests of the captive peo\u00ad ples and of the free world. Credits without quid pro quo would en\u00ad able the Red systems to continue operating as they are, slowing reform, freezing or scrapping it. This appraisal is not guess\u00ad work. Once assured of substantial U.S. cred\u00ad its in 1964, Rumania became the only satel\u00ad lite where even discussion of possible re\u00ad forms was taboo. As soon as large-scale American aid for Poland was nailed down in 1958, the Communist Party there rejected a radical reform plan drawn by the Polish Economic Council the previous year. As long as American help was pouring in, Yugo\u00ad slavia did nothing about llberal programs formulated in the mid-'Fifties; since the help dried up two years ago, the Yugoslavs have been racing to introduce economic in\u00ad centives, managerial initiatives and other \"capitalist\" concepts. Unconditional long-term credits simply would eliminate or relieve the bloc's acute pressures. Why bother to remedy the for\u00ad eign-exchange pinch by narrowing the qual\u00ad ity gap between Eastern and Western com\u00ad petitive products instead of concentrating on space exploration and armaments-if the U.S. obllgingly waives the need for foreign e:x.change? Why decentralize management and reduce the Party's control, or decollec\u00ad tivize and allow the peasants to till their own land or form genuine cooperatives-if the U.S. supplies industrial machinery and technical guidance, chemicals and agrarian know-how which will enable the totalitarian _ economy to get by without drastic overhaul? Why scratch for efficiency, lower costs and profltab111ty in a liberalized economy so as to earn investment capital for rational ex\u00ad pansion-if the Americans will do the in\u00ad vesting and ship the expe.nsion? Why raise wages and give other rewards for greater effort by labor-if American techniques and equipment will increase productivity with\u00ad out such costly incentives? MAKING A BUCK Suppose the second alternative is adopted and Washington suppresses entirely its im\u00ad pulse for long-term financing of bloc econo\u00ad mies. The exact positive of the negatives listed above will not accrue, if only because other countries may continue ' their present zeal for \"making a buck\" out of Red trade. But to the large extent that their resources cannot fill the void created by our absten\u00ad tion, the stresses inside bloc economies will have their chance to perform constructively. After all, the wave of reform clamor by Red economists was not provoked by us but by the inherent defects of the existing sys\u00ad tem. The first satellite to pick up the re\u00ad formist theses of the Liberman school in the USSR and make the biggest noise about them was Czechoslovakia-which had been the most industrialized prior to the Communist grab and therefore the first to bog down un\u00ad der Communist mis~nanagement. If we refrain from solving its dilemmas, the bloc may yet be constrained for economic survival to do something about them. The USSR has the largest problems, because, on a much smaller economic basis, it supports armament and space programs comparable to the American. And all the Conecon mem\u00ad bers must increase their agricultural in\u00ad vestments, keep other investments at a level adequate for a minimum 4 percent growth in gross national produc\u00b7t, and somehow lure the cooperation of farm and factory workers. Till now the leadership has been resisting basic changes which could create counter\u00ad forces against the Party's hegemony. But necessity may yet compel the acceptance of political risks: incentives to end foot-drag\u00ad ging by peasants and workers; less planning and more productivity; more butter and less moonshots; the accumulation of foreign ex\u00ad change by outselllng competitors abroad rather than by outdumping them, and so on. There remains a final, supreme considera.:. tion for any American businessman who may still hanker after elusive profit from selling to the Communists. He must decide in his own private conscience whether the profit is worth the personal risk that some day, soon or late, on some near or distant battle\u00ad field, his neighbor's son or his own may be struck down by a weapon which his zeal for trade put into an enemy's hand. ARMIES AND INNER LEADERSHIP Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the January 1967 issue of Military Review, which is the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College magazine, contains a valuable article entitled \"Armies and Inner Leadership.\" This article was wrttten by a man extremely well versed in military matters, Mr. Anthony Harrt\u00ad gan. Mr. Harrigan is associate editor of the CharlestQn, S.C. News and Courier, ' and also is a member of the Institute for Strategic . Studies, . of London, England. Mr. Harrigan brings to this subject a wealth of background information on military affairs, having served in the U.S. Maline Corps durtng World War II, presently acting as military consultant for the National Strategy Committee of the National Security Council, and hav\u00ad ing studied and wrttten extensively on all phases of military activities. Mr. Harrigan places in proper prospec\u00ad tive the role of the military in the life and society of the United States, and this article places to rest some of the old shibboleths which are constantly used to downgrade military service. To quote one paragraph, Mr. Harrtgan says: Insofar as the United States is concerned, the question of the place of the military serv\u00ad ices in society is really synthetic and stirred up. In the United States, there has been a traditional unity of civil and mllltary pur\u00ad poses. Indeed, the critics of the mllitary component of our society have yet to prove that there is a \"military mlnd\"ln the United February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4711 States as distinct from the thought patterns of the responsible civillan community. Mr. President, this article is an ex\u00ad cellent treatise and would be of invalu\u00ad able assistance to anyone concerned with the proper role of the military in the American way of life. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the CoN\u00ad GRESSIONAL RECORD following these re\u00ad marks. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ARMmS AND INNER LEADERSHIP (By Anthony Harrigan) (NoTE.-Atithony Harrigan is the author of \"Combat in Cities\" which appeared in the May 1966 issue of the Military Review. He is Associate Editor of The News and Courier, Charleston, South Carolina, and a member of the Institute for Strategic Studies (Lon\u00ad don). Mr. Harrigan served in the U.S. Ma\u00ad rine Corps during World War II, is a military consultant to the National Strategy Commit\u00ad tee of tb,e American Security Council, and is U.S. correspondent for the Canadian Military Journal.} The role that armed forces play in human society is the subject of considerable debate in the public arena. Soldiers are not only defending themselves on the battlefield, but also are having to defend their concepts of professionalism against a wide variety of sharpshooting criticF of the military life. One author, who has written extensively on the ideals of military service, has cited the \"caricature of the trigger-happy, slaugh\u00ad ter-minded, war-mongering ofiicer .\" This caricature crops up frequently. For example, one contemporary critic of the armed forces has \u00b7spoken of a struggle between a \"huge warmaking organism and the apparatus of democracy.\" Fortunately, the caricature does not always prevail. President John F. Kennedy, in a salute to the Nation's milltary services, once said that \"Armies cannot only defend their countries-they can help build them.\" The question being debated -in some aca\u00ad demic circles in the United States is whether armies represent a socially constructive or destructive element in the llfe of a nation and a civilization. This is not exclusively a U.S. question. The place of the army in the national life has been an issue in France dur\u00ad ing much of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the Soviet Union, professional military cadres long have been viewed as suspect by the Communist Party. Whether armies are in\u00ad struments of order or disorder is a bone of contention among students of the Latin\u00ad American 9ountries. \u00b7 PLACE IN U.S. SOCIETY \u00b7 Insofar as the United States is concerned, the question of the place of the military services in society is really synthetic and stirred up. In the United State8, there has been a traditional unity of civil and milltary purposes. Indeed, the critics of the military component of our society have yet to prove that there is a \"military mind\" in the United States as distinct from the thought patterns of the responsible civ1llan community. Military service and service to the civilian community have been regarded as being of the same character throughout U.S. history. No contradiction or separation of purpose was considered involved as in some coun\u00ad tries where the armed forces have been an island apart. The history of the United States is rich in examples of professional of\u00ad fleers serving in high posts in the civilian Government after retirement from active duty. Whether for this or other reasons, little attention has been focused on the contribu\u00ad tion that armed forces })ave made to the hu\u00ad man order down through the a.g~. In. the United States, military men in the past have not had to develop a rationale for their ex\u00ad istence. It is only in recent years that there have been national and even global cam\u00ad paigns aimed at condemning the U.S. use of force to protect national interests. However, today the military professional increasingly is in the position of the pollceman who in the past had only to use his authority to main\u00ad tain order, and who now is compelled to justify his exercise of police authority. DEVELOP PUBLIC PHn.OSOPHY The m111tary professional, living within his service, knows that he and his associates are not trigger-happy and not slaughter\u00ad minded. He knows the restraint with which weapons are used. He understands and re\u00ad spects civ111an authority over the Defense Es\u00ad tablishment. He is fam111ar with the sense of responsibil1ty and social obligation which characterizes his profession in this era. But the individual soldier's knowledge of his rel1ab1lity as a citizen is not in itself an ade\u00ad quate defense against those who regard everyone in uniform as a mil1tarist and downgrade the role of armies as human institutions. It is necessary, therefore, that the modern soldier develop a publlc phllosophy for his profession so that the nation as a whole may better understand the contribution made by the uniformed element in the national life. In developing such a philosophy, it is useful to search out the lessons of history that shed light on the functions of armed forces. In this connection, there is much merit in examining the writings of Indian authors. India is a country in which theories of nonviolence and nonresistance have had enormous acceptance. The Gan\u00ad dhian doctrines took root among both the masses and intellectual elite of India. As a result, the Indian m111tary services suffered a loss of status in the years following India's independence. Not until 1962, when Com\u00ad munist China invaded India and shattered concepts of peaceful coexistence in Asia, was there a reversal of the Indian philosophy with respect to m111tary service. HISTORICAL ROLES One of the Indian writers who has taken a fresh look at the role of the armed forces is Professor Muhammad Mujeeb, Vice Chan\u00ad cellor of Jamia Mlllia Islamia in New Delhi. He recently analyzed the role of armies in history and quoted Werner Sombart, the German economist, who said: \"In the be\u00ad ginning was the army.\" Professor Mujeeb observed that \"no historian could disagree with him,\" pointing out that armies have been the principal means of change in \"the process of grafting of peoples, cultures, tech\u00ad niques, ideas on to each other to which we owe zpost of the progress we have made.\" Asserting that armed conflict \"can be a means of placing social and polltical systems on \u00b7trial, and of infusing vitallty in those that have become petrified,\" Professor Mujeeb suggested that it is possible to dis\u00ad tinguish between wars that are in the nature of surgical operations on societies unable to fulfill the conditions of survival and wars that are purely destructive. He stated: \"Alexander the Great's imperialist ambi\u00ad tions influenced world history by making the peoples of West Asia and Egypt heirs to Greek culture,\u00b7 the military exploits of Timur are a record of merciless destruction without any purpose.\" This analysis has value for the milltary professional, for it is important that he not accept the stereotype of armies in action as destructive forces. In World War II, the US Armed Forces not only protected the freedom and physical integrity of the United States, but carried out extraordinary meas\u00ad ures of pacification and national rehabilita\u00ad tion. US occupation administrations in Japan and Germany must be credited with enor-mous achievements in rebuilding two ad\u00ad vanced nations along constructive lines. While civ111ans played a part in both ad\u00ad ministrations, the accomplishments were overwhelmingly those of men in the uni\u00ad formed service of their country. It is, per\u00ad haps, too early to compare these feats with events in classical times, but one cannot overlook the parallels with ancient nation\u00ad bullding feats performed by Greek and Roman soldiers. BACKWARD STATES Truly phenomenal is the influence a m1li\u00ad tary presence has had on some of the back\u00ad .waters of the world. For example, the South Pacific region-an ocean area comparable in size to the greatest of continents-has changed more in the last quarter century as a result of World War II than in the pre\u00ad ceding hundreds of years. Across the world in Turkey, the army has been the key social instrument in the rise of that country from the backwardness and ignorance of the Ottoman era. The Turkish Army serves as a school for the nation, ab\u00ad sorbing illiterate recruits and training them for useful llves in the civil1an community. Turkish Army units in the countryside even adopt villages as part of a broad program of civic action. An army-it should be borne in mind\u00ad is a spec1al1zed form of human order. In advanced nations such as the United States, it has specialized and Umited functions be\u00ad cause society has a complex civil order that meets publlc needs. In less developed or truly backward states, an army often is the only available form of order. In such a situation, the army is a society in minia\u00ad ture-an organism capable of getting things done, productive of both plans and end results, and cemented by loyalty and obedi\u00ad ence. It is a command structure essential in weak or threatened nations. Those who say that the trouble with much of Latin America Ues with the armed forces have not considered the effect of a lack of an alternative civil order in many countries in that region. If the structure of the civil government is not strong, disorder reigns and is exploited by those seeking the overthrow of a nation. COMMUNIST POWER Communist Parties, wherever these exist, are another form of order. They represent an armed doctrine, an action organism, a state within a state. In the absence of an army capable of maintaining the national integrity from attack within, the civil struc\u00ad ture of a weak state is Ukely to fall before Insurg~nt assault by the Communist power structure. Thus, it is the height of folly to call for the breakup of professional armies in sznall, weak nations. In 'the advanced states, armed forces have a \u00b7wholly different role. They are clearly subordinate to the civil authority, but even in these countrles, armed forces may have specified civll action responsiblllties such as flood control and harbor management. They do not, however, direct the societies of which they are a part except as individual officers assigned responsib1llty in government by the executive authority. Nevertheless, the armed forces in advanced states have heavy responsib111ties. One of these responsibillties concerns the readiness of deployment of military power to fulfill the national security objectives establlshed ' by the c1v1llan leadership. In short, armies have places to guard and battles to win .. Less understood is another part of the responsibility of armed forces in highly de\u00ad veloped states. This responsibility has to do with that intangible but important ele\u00ad ment in armies-the quality of the human beings who have dedicated their lives to service in the military profession. Although there certainly is not a m111tary mind in the United States in the seD.\u00a7e of a 4712 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 Prussian-type militarism, there is a profes\u00ad sional awareness of the imperatives of duty. M111tary training is supposed to leave a spe\u00ad cial imprint of responsib111ty on the citizen in uniform. The concepts of duty, honor, and country are especially important to a democracy in an age when almost all moral\u00ad ists and social commentators are agreed that values have been gravely eroded under the pressure of change. The fundamental differences between the m111tary professional and his fellow citizen In civ111an life is that the former does not live in a permissive environment. This Is an important difference. Many social commen\u00ad tators have warned that permissiveness has had an unfortunate effect on US life. With the dilution of stern attitudes of an earlier period, a number of destructive and impul\u00ad sive tendencies have been noted. Increased crime, social 1rresponsib111ty, and civil dis\u00ad obedience have become serious problems. Among the social ills are disordered family life, a higher rate of bankruptcy, a lack of confidence between generations, and more draft dodging. VALUE OF DISCIPLINE Conversely, the m111tary life-which is def\u00ad initely not permissive-builds into citizens an understanding of the value of the dis\u00ad ciplined life. Uniformed personnel know that the greatest freedom is 1n service to the ideals of one's country. This is not surpris\u00ad ing, for the lessons of the battlefield are the lessons of sacrifice, comradeship, personal re\u00ad sponsib111ty, and accountab111ty. M111tary life is life according to a code in which intell1- gence and training are related to fundamen\u00ad tal social goals. More thought should be given to the fact that the military. profession in the Unit.ed States has lived with nuclear arms for al\u00ad most a generation. Those who have handled the most powerful weapons ever known to mankind have demonstrated the intellectual capacity to prepare for war with these devices while, at the same time, demonstrating the mor.al strength it takes to live with and keep leashed these eng1nes of destruction. The very last person who could emerge ;f,rom \u00b7the military ,profession m the United States is the mad bomlber of pruc1flst trects. It is .not just a rruttter Of needing more than one ofllcer to turn a key, or other procedural srufeguards; it 15 also a matter of wa.tning men with the moral stamina to bear the heaviest of national !resp<msilb1Urties. Holmes Alexander, who hias had wide ex\u00ad perience in observing the miJlitary prof\u00b7ession, hash written in. this connection: \"To the etxent that the choosing and train\u00ad ing of young military men-the top officers of the near future-are successfully con\u00ad ducted, the more we alter our society for the better ... The reporter who travels for a while among modern warriors soon finds an accumulation of admirable traits and hon\u00ad orable codes which are far less prevalent\u00ad certainly less stressed-in the civilian seg\u00ad ment. The military today is the opposite of anti-social. It is pro-social in a big way. It is neither trigger-happy nor trigger-shy.\" SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS This assessment of the values enhanced by the milltary life emphasizes the impor\u00ad tance of the Armed Forces as social institu\u00ad tions in US society. It is to be hoped that such assessments will lead to an apprecia\u00ad tion of the worthwhtle character of m111tary service for as many young men as possible. The mistaken idea exists in some quarters that military service represents \"time out\" of a young man's life. It seems clear, how\u00ad ever, that the period of military service is an increasingly vital part of a US citizen's edu\u00ad cation for life in a world wherein disorder is rampant. Professor Hugh Seton-Wats \u00b7on, the British historian, recently warned that dictatorships could emerge froni the \"uprooted, classless, faceless hordes\" of the large European and American cities. Many of the young turn to generational strife and civil disobedience because the education they have received has been inadequate. They have had the intellect trained, but their values are not rooted in a code of life. Military service, especially the small-unit warfare of today's struggle in the Far East, provides a classical form of education in the duties of manhood; it ends the alienation that many modern youths experience. Looking back on Roman times, we discover how the legionnaires were not only fighters, but civ1llzation builders. The camps of the legions became towns and cities. They pro\u00ad vided the peace that made orderly life pos\u00ad sible among barbarians, and laid the founda\u00ad tion for a higher stage of life. The legions were the instruments that Rome used to overcome barbarism on the Empire's strategic frontiers. First came the sword and then the ploughshare. A similar pattern existed in the settlement of the US West. The Army made the peace and pro\u00ad vided the framework for civil order and then the life of the territories was developed. The modern era has created a new set of problems. Barbarism is not only something beyond the pale-a force on the outside. Barbarism is a force within a state. It is not only the guerrllla who must be reckoned with by the military forces, but the nlhUlst who erodes the life of the homefront be\u00ad hind the men on the battlefront. The breakdown of internal values can be seen in many areas. We discerned It In the moral collapse of Germany when that country fell from within to the Inner bar\u00ad barians-the Nazis. The increasing lawless\u00ad ness of US cities is a grave problem, suggest\u00ad ing a major breakdown of morale and social cohesiveness. It may be that the armed services, by the training in discipline that they give those who put on their country's uniform, wlll be able to deal effectively with the th.reat of inner ba.rbarlsm. ~ The Federa~l ~pU:bltc Of German Ann.y, established in the 1950's on new founda\u00ad tions, did remarkable work in this field through its emphasis on inner leadership. The people of West Germany wanted a new army that embodied the professionalism of the old army and the social faith of the new Germany. The shapers of the Bundeswehr shared the belief of Rlaymond Aron, ddstingulshed it 1s not the teaching of specdflc programs. ~[t is the moml strengthend.ng o!' the Emphasis on Inn~ leadership is not on~y .t.ntended to produce a \u00b7better soldier and a better oitizen, but is s!med at promoting the social cohesion that a country must have to survive and to achieve great things. \u00b7 One of the dangers of our time is the loss of this social cohesion. In the United States and elsewhere in the West, there has been a disturbing emergence of the anarchist spirit and philosophy which suggests to some that Individuals and small groups have no ob\u00ad ligations to the larger community. However this anarchism is revealed, it threatens dis\u00ad integration of the unity that is a nation. When this attitude is limited to a few in\u00ad dividuals, it Is not a menace to public order. But if this anarchist spirit becomes con\u00ad tagious, then it opens the way for foreign conquerors. Without a code of behavior and a prevail\u00ad ing sentiment, a country falls apart; it is without a center. A nation that Is a col\u00ad lection of anarchic adventurers is no nation at all. To be sure, preserving the cohesion of the nation is partly the task tlf home, church and school. But military service also is a vital part of schooling In citizenship and national values.\u00b7 It is, perhaps, the toughest and most valuable of educational experiences in a democracy, for it demands that Intel\u00ad ligence be combined with courage and loy\u00ad alty to ideals-often at the risk of death. In a real sense, therefore, the armed forces are the capstone of the educational system whereby citizens are embued with the quali\u00ad ties essential to a free society. If this is un\u00ad derstood by the public, then the constructive role of armed forces also is comprehended. CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further morning business? If not, morn\u00ad ing business is closed. MILITARY PROCUREMENT TITLE Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 665. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be stated by title for the information of the Senate. The ASSISTANT LEGISLATIVE CLERK. S. 665, to authorize appropriations during the fiscal year 1967 for procurement of aircraft, missiles, and tracked combat ve\u00ad hicles, and research, development, test, evaluation, and military construction for the Armed Forces, and for other pur\u00ad poses. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to its consideration. RECESS UNTIL 2 O'CLOCK P.M. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, I move that the Senate stand in recess until 2 o'clock p.m. this after\u00ad noon. The motion was agreed to; and (at 1 o'clock and 23 minutes p.m.>, the Sen\u00ad ate took a recess until 2 o'clock p.m. the same day. At 2 o'clock p.m., on the expiration of the recess, the Senate reconvened, when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. HOLLINGS in the chair). LEGISLATIVE REORGANIZATION ACT OF 1967 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 2 o'clock having arrived, the Chair lays before the Senate the unfin\u00ad ished business, which the clerk will state. The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. A bill (8. 31)5) to improve the operation of the leg\u00ad islative branch of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment, and for other purposes. The Senate proceeded to consider the bill. . : ... MILITARY PROCUREMENT Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the unfinished business, S. 355, be tem\u00ad porarily laid aside, and that the Senate continue its consideration of S. 665, the military procurement bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill w111 be stated by title. The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. A bill (8. 665) to authorize authorizations during the fiscal year 1967 for procurement of aircraft, missiles, and tracked combat' February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4713 vehicles, and research, development, test, evaluation, and military construction for the Armed Forces, and for other pur\u00ad poses. The Senate resumed the consideration of the .bill. Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the call for the quorum be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, what is the pending business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is Senate blll 665. Mr. MANSFIELD. Are there any amendments pending to the measure be\u00ad fore us? The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment pending at the present time. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, a parlia\u00ad mentary inquiry, and I should like, if I could, to have the attention of the ma\u00ad jority leader. Mr. MANSFIELD. Yes. Mr. CLARK. It is my understanding that when I was necessarily away from the Chamber-- Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator was absent on official business. Mr. CLARK. I thank the Senator. As a co.urtesy to me the majority leader recessed the Senate until 2 o'clock p.m., and a unanimous-consent agreement was entered into which, as I understand it, provides that starting tomorrow there shall be 1 hour allowed on each amend\u00ad ment, and in all likelihood my amend\u00ad ments will be first, there will be 4 hours on the bill, and that as a result there will be no votes on amendments today. Is that correct? Mr. MANSFIELD. Whether or not there will be any votes, I cannot say. I do not anticipate any, but somebody could call up an amendment and there could be a vote on it, but it is an un\u00ad likely possibility. If I may make one correction, the time limitation begins at the conclusion of morning business to\u00ad morrow; we come in at 11 o'clock; have a brief morning hour; the business runs 3 hours under the Pastore rule on germaneness; and then, under the previous unanimous-consent order, the senior Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. PASTORE], and others interested in the question of textiles, will undertake a roundrobin debate on that most im\u00ad por:tant subject. Mr. CLARK. So tha\u00b7t in effect we will have 3 hours tomorrow on the pending business, including amendments, under the unanimous-consent agreement. Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator is correct. Mr. CLARK. I thank my friend from Montana. I should like to address a question to the Senator from New York. Does the Sen8itor desire .to be heard today? OXIJJI--299..........PM't 4 Mr. JAVITS. I have been heard al\u00ad ready. I may wish to speak a little later on, after listening to what has been go\u00ad ing on. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, let me state what my present intentions are, so that they may make their plans and act accordingly. I am committed to the Senate to call up my first amendment today. It is my present intention to do so toward the end of afternoon business. In the mean\u00ad time, as I understand it, the Senator from Oregon [Mr. MoRsEl, who will be here shortly, as well as the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. FuLBRIGHTJ, who also will be here shortly, desire to be heard. Since they are not presently in the Chamber, I will begin my speech now and ask unanimous consent that when either of them comes into the Chamber, to yield to them in order that I may meet their convenience. Mr. JAVITS. Will the Senator include me in that unanimous-consent request? I may wish to be heard. Mr. CLARK. I am happy to do so. I encourage the Senator from New York to lend his silver-tongued voice to the progress of this debate. \u00b7 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With\u00ad out objection, it is so ordered. \"WHAT PRICE GLORY?\" Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, the title of my speech is: \"What Price Glory?\" I intend to develop the baloance sheet of the Vietnam war as I see it. First, the alleged assets in terms of our national honor and national security by which the war is said to be justified; and, then, my own view of the liabilities which the war is imposing on the American Nation. \u00b7 The reason for my title is that I con\u00ad clude we are paying a very heavy price, indeed, for whatever glory there may be for our country in the Vietnamese con\u00ad flict, a price which, in my opinion, is far too high. Yet I must assert this caveat, that I am not one who would withdraw unilaterally from Vietnam despite the fact that I do not believe we should ever have gone in there; but I am. one who would assert that our primary objective should be to get this dirty little war-from which we gain so Uttle oand lose so much-over with just as soon as we can, with reason\u00ad ablehonor. By reasonable honor, I do not mean glory, milltary victories, bands, and a lot of parades. I mean a sober and ma\u00ad ture determination as to how much of our objectives in Vietnam we can, at this point, reasonably expect to achieve with\u00ad out an undue cost,.in lives and fortune, and heavy cost indeed to the economy of this country. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I yield the :floor. UNITED STATES HOPES FOR DE\u00ad TENTE WITH RUSSIA Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, a very interesting article containing a very good analysis was published in the Baltimore Sun, on January 19, 1967, writ\u00ad ten by Mr. Philip Potter of the Washing\u00ad ton Bureau of the Sun. Mr. Potter is a man who knows the Far East. He knows Asia, and he gives what I believe to be an objective writeup concerning many of the conditions in the Far East and southeast Asia. I believe that the article is worth com\u00ad mending to my fellow colleagues in the Senate to read, and I therefore ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: RISE OF \"PRAGMATIC\" RULERS STmS U.S. HOPES FOR DETENTE (By Ph111p Potter) WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.-When the Johnson Administration casts its eyes abroad it sees beyond the Vietnam conflict to what it con\u00ad siders hopeful vista&-even in China. Concededly the present situation in Viet\u00ad nam remains \"dour and di1ficult,\" although the President and his principal foreign policy advisers believe there is some light at the end of that tunnel. Elsewhere, the Administration sees heart\u00ad ening signs. PRAGMATISTS COMING IN In Latin America, Africa and in the rest of Asia, it is contended, there is \"a tremen\u00ad dous amount of slow turning in the right direction\"-toward economic and political stab111ty. Administration foreign policy, in fact, is increasingly predicated on a belief that the world is in \"transition\" from an era in which \"romantic revolutionaries\" have held sway to one in which \"pragmatists\" are coming into power. The inference is that pragmatists will be easier to deal with. -Placed in the category of \"romantic revo\u00ad lutionaries\" who have faded or are fading from the scene are such leaders as Red Chi\u00ad na's Mao Tse-tung, President Sukarno of Indonesia, Nkrumah, Algeria's Premier Ahmed ben Bella; The United Arab Republic's Presi\u00ad dent Gamal Abdel Nasser and former Pre\u00ad mier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union~ While the cautious reading here is that Mao is not yet to be classed among the \"faded,\" the belief seems to be that the trend in Communist China, as elsewhere, Is In the direction of a \"pragmatic regime.\" Ironically, in respect to Red China, neither the United States nor the Soviet Union ts entirely confident about what a pragmatic turn there would involve. The Russians have some apprehensions that it could mean a \"deal\" between Peking and the United States, while there are some here who think it would mean a healing of the breach between Russia and Red China, again oonfrontlng the West with combined Communist power. On th.e whole, however, the !au.ssia.ns seem to be doing the most w.oreying. One of their chief fears is -that the OUllTent strife. in China couad destl'oy the Communist party tthere and bring rule by a mUitary \"Naeserist\" who conceivably would cast covetous eyes on once-4714 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 Chinese territories now embraced in the Soviet empire, just as Nasser would like to rule or at least dominate a United Arab world. It should not be lost sight of however, that another area on which Peking casts covetous eye's is Formosa (Taiwan), now included in our sphere of protection. A Peking \"Nasserist\" could look that way, too. In any event, the turmoil in Red China is of momentous import in the world. It could affect, for instance, the course of the Vietnam war, since so much o! Hanoi's sup\u00ad plies come from Red China. DEPENDENT ON 800,000 TONS OJ' RICE Harrison Salisburg, in a series of articles about his visit to North Vietnam, said it was believed that Hanoi may be dependent on China for as much as 600,000 or 800,000 tons of rice in 1967-1968 because of the short-fall in North Vietnam's crop due to bad weather and lack of manpower. That is almost as much grain tonnage as the United States sent to India last year (largely wheat and sorghum). Red China has no food surplus of its own, and has been purchasing about 6,000,000 tons of wheat a year from Canada, Australia and Argentina. , Obviously if the turmoil continues to spread, China's industrial output wm go down and so wm the foreign exchange earn\u00ad ings which permit it to buy foreign grain. Hanoi could soon feel the squeeze. RAIL TRANSPORT DISRUPTED Actual shipment of supplies from Red China to Hanoi also could be affected. Re\u00ad ports reaching here are that the rail line between Shanghai and Peking, for instance, has been idle since the third week in Decem\u00ad ber, because of strikes and strife. Whether or not there is gain for America in Vietnam as a result of developments in Red China, the Administration wishes -its foreign policy critics would focus not only pn the conflict there but on what is happen\u00ad ing\u00b7 in Asia and in other parts of the world. The President, in his State-of-the-Union message, dealt with Vietnam only in the last three pages because he wanted to focus at\u00ad tention on other things domestic and foreign. REGIONAL SOLUTIONS One thing pointed to with pride is a grow\u00ad ing trend toward regional solutions to prob\u00ad lems among the many small states (and some large ones) in Latin America, Africa and Asia. Mr. Johnson and his foreign policy advisers see such regionalism as a healthy alternative to excessive nationalism. Regional combines produce a sense of status and dignity, it was said, and make it easier for smaller states to deal with big ones on a basis of parity. For the United States, it means possibil\u00ad ities of sharing burdens it has been carrying alone, or almost alone. Mr. Johnson nq'tes, for instance, that the United States w:as called upon to put up only 20 per cent of the capital in the new Asian Development Bank, an amount matched by Japan. THROUGH \"FILLING VACUUMS'' That is a trend he would like to cultivate in all our undertakings abroad. As one source put it, America has passed from the time of \"filllng vacuums'-as in Greece, Korea and Vietnam-to a time when 1t can hope to pull some of the\u00b7 \"saved\" countries into regional combines in a way that will spare\u00b7 national sens1b111t1es and save the United States money. In short, the Administration believes its foreign policy has been formulated with more wisdom than it has been credited with. MILITARYPROCUREMENT . The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill <S. 665) to authorize appro\u00ad priations during the fiscal year 19\u00b767 for procurement of aircraft, missiles, and tracked combat vehicles, and research, development, test, evaluation, and mili\u00ad tary construction for the Armed Forces, and for other purposes. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished Sena\u00ad tor from Georgia [Mr. RussELL] in col\u00ad loquy for the purpose of clarifying my views and my thoughts about the situa\u00ad tion in Vietnam, for which this author\u00ad ization and appropriation is intended. Much has been said about Vietnam. I have tried to make clear my own posi\u00ad tion as to the general nature of that conflict. However, there are some aspects of our involvement which I believe should be discussed further in view of the nature of the bill before us. I do not wish to prolong this discussion, but I hope that the Senator from Georgia would be willing to respond to some questions. Mr. RUSSELL. I am somewhat ap\u00ad prehensive when I see how well-armed the Senator from Arkansas is. I am defenseless except for what little smat\u00ad tering of knowledge I have with me in my head and not on paper; but I would be happy to undertake to make any re\u00ad sponses of which I am capable. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator from Georgia is quite capable. He is the best authority in this body, if not in the en\u00ad tire Government, on the subject of our Armed Forces. It is out of my high re\u00ad spect for him, and the country's respect for his knowledge, that I wish to \u00b7address these questions to him. I wonder if the Senator from Georgia could tell us how many American men are now serving in, or are involved directly in, fighting the war in Vietnam. Mr. RUSSELL. The last figures that were made available to the committee indicated there are 414,000 men in South Vietnam; 35,000 in ThaHand; and about 40,000 in the Navy, in the waters adjacent thereto. Mr. FULBRIGHT. In that regard, can the Senator tell us how many-! do not believe the figures are classified-\u00ad Mr. RUSSELL. I hope it is not classi\u00ad fied information. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not think it is. Mr. RUSSELL. I am of the opinion that the figures that were given at the time of the hearing were left in the rec..; ord and some troops have been sent there subsequently, and that information has appeared in the press and has been broadcast over the air and, I think, on some television films. Mr. FULBRIGHT. In the last day or two there have been some interesting discussions about our troop commit\u00ad ments to NATO. As the Senator knows, the majority leader has proposed a reso\u00ad lution concerning that subject. I have been approached by administration offi\u00ad cials on this subject. While the issue does not bear directly on the pending question, it is related to our overall com\u00ad mitments, whether in Vietnam or Eu\u00ad rope. Would the Senator agree that, in terms of U.S. forces involved, the war in Viet\u00ad nam is now larger than the Korean oon\u00ad _filct\u00b7 Mr. RUSSELL. Yes; it is slightly larger. The number of American forces engaged in Vietnam is larger than the number that was engaged at any one time in Korea. We never had more than 330,000 in Korea at any one time. Mr. FULBRIGHT. So it is substan\u00ad tially larger now. Mr. RUSSELL. Yes. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator has often discussed on this floor the Consti\u00ad tution of our Nation. He knows I have been very much in agreement with his views with regard to the applicability of the Constitution to domestic issues. The Senator is a great student of the history of the Constitution. Does he recall the discussion in the Constitutional Con\u00ad vention over the question of the wording of the Constitution-whether the Con\u00ad gress shouLd have the power to \"make\" or \"declare\" war?' Mr. RUSSELL. Yes; I recall some\u00ad thing about that in Madison's papers wherein he reported what took place in the Constitutional Convention. The original draft empowered Congress to make war, and the members of the Con\u00ad vention decided Congress was not so con\u00ad stituted that it could make war, so they changed the language to \"declare\" war, leaving the power to direct the armies in the President as Commander in Chief. I am confident I am correct about that. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Is it not also true that the reasoning which prompted the change from the original draft, to which the Senator referred, was that the Presi\u00ad dent should be left with the power to repel sudden attacks? Mr. RUSSELL. That is correct. In the event of a sudden attack, Congress would not have time to prepare to make war, and the Commander in Chief should have that power. Of course, the Senator is more familiar with the long debates that have sur\u00ad rounded this whole issue. They began back on the NATO Treaty, and went through all the Korean conflict, as to just how much power the President had to order American troops into foreign lands without a declaration of war by the Congress. It is a constitutional question that is very intriguing. I remember the President, on more than 125 occasions, has exercised his power as Commander in Chief to order the Armed Forces of the United States into foreign lands. I have had some interesting thoughts about that provision of the Constitution. I often wondered what would happen if the President vetoed a declaration of war, and just where we would be left in that event. What is the opinion of the Senator from Arkansas in that respect? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I would imagine, if we found ourselves in that situation, that the President would be in peril of im\u00adpeachment. Mr. RUSSELL. It takes only a major\u00ad ity to declare war, but it takes two-thirds to impeach. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I cannot imagine the circumstances under which a veto of a declaration of war might take place, although it could. The Senator will agree, will he not, that there has not been anything \"sud\u00ad den\" about the war in Vietnam? It was not a sudden attack. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4715 Mr. RUSSELL. No, I would not con\u00ad sider it a sudden attack on the United States. Mr. FULBRIGHT. At the time of the adoption of the southeast Asia resolu\u00ad tion in 1964 there were only about 16,000 American servicemen in Vietnam. As the Senator has already stated, we now have some 414,000 there. Mr. RUSSELL. It is about 500,000 in the southeast Asia area. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator from Arkansas knows, from past experience, that the Senator from Georgia has been greatly concerned about the increase in the powers of the executive branch of the Government, particularly so with re\u00ad gard to certain domestic issues. He has expressed those views eloquently on the floor of the Senate on many occasions. Mr. RUSSELL. I certainly have un\u00ad dertaken to express myself clearly to the effect that I had great concern about the status of our system of checks and balances and division of powers, and that Congress was being subordinated to both the executive and the judiciary. Mr. FULBRIGHT. From recent dis\u00ad cussions, I know that the Senator has great respect for Prof. Henry Steele Commager, regarded as the dean of American historians, and a distinguished gentleman who recently appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. RUSSELL. Yes; I have a high regard for him as a historian. I have read some of his works. I am not fa\u00ad miliar with his statement in his ap\u00ad pearance before the Foreign Relations Committee, although a member of the committee, knowing of my interest in this subject, sent me a copy of his speech. It is on my desk. I have not had the opportunity to read it. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I think his testi\u00ad mony is pertinent to the issue now before us. If the Senator will permit me, I will read from pages 41 and 42 of the hearings of February 20 before the For\u00ad eign Relations Committee. Professor Commager was asked about the constitu\u00ad tional provisions relating to a declara\u00ad tion of war in the light of the situation in Vietnam. This is what he said: I think what is necessary is a full-scale discussion in the Congress and outside Con\u00ad gress over this extraordinarily important question o:( how far the Executive power must obtain to meet emergencies and to act where the interests and security of the na\u00ad tion are involved, and how the Congress of the United States keeps control on such de\u00ad cisions as are made. We have, to my mind, drifted into a sit\u00ad uation which is fraught With danger, one where the shift has gone all the way, and where, by a series of unforeseen, unexpected and, perhaps unforeseeable processes, de\u00ad claring war has all but evaporated, and making war has taken its place and where, therefore, the center of gravity has shifted almost imperceptibly but now quite de\u00ad cidedly to the Executive Branch. Would the Senator agree that we have \"drifted into a situation which is fraught with danger\" because of our. growil)g in\u00ad volvement there without a declaration of war? , Mr. RUSSELL. I think that is one element of danger to our system. I do not. think it is the most dangerous threat that is posed to our constitutional sys-tern. Personally, I think some of the recent decisions of the Supreme Court are a greater threat to our constitutional system than the situation outlined by the Senator from Arkansas; but this, too, is an element of dange-:-to the position of the legislative branch of the Govern\u00ad ment. I am sure the Senator will recall that when the so-called Tonkin Gulf joint resolution was pending before the Sen\u00ad ate. I offered an amendment, in order to protect the prerogatives of Congress, that was included in the joint resolution as passed. That amendment permits Congress by a concurren~ resolution, which does not require the approval of the President, to terminate all the pow\u00ad ers and all the approval that were given by the Tonkin Gulf joint resolution. A majority of Congress can annul that joint resolution today, if they wish to do so, without the President's being able to in\u00ad tervene with a veto. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator is correct; and that is only further evidence of the concern he has had in the past about the confusion of powers. Mr. RUSSELL. I still have the con\u00ad cern; it increases with time. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I am glad to hear the Senator say that. One of the pend\u00ad ing amendments on which th~ Senate will have to vote tomorrow, involves the question of a declaration of war, I was trying to lay a basis for proper consid\u00ad eration of this amendment. I wish to read the paragraph from Professor Com\u00ad mager's testimony which follows those I have just read: It seems to me that the responsib111ty for that is, and I should not say this to you dis\u00ad tinguished gentlemen- Mr. Commager was speaking to the members of the committee- is as much on the Senate as it is on the Executive Branch of the Government, and that what we have Witnessed not just now but in the past as well on numerous oc\u00ad casions, is something very close to an abdica\u00ad tion of the Congressional authority in this realm in the face of what appear to be national emergencies, and I think all we can fairly say here, we cannot say that the President must be shorn of his power to meet emergencies, that would be too dan\u00ad gerous a situation, we cannot say that the Congressional , particularly the Senatorial au\u00ad thority can now be safely ignored. That way, too, is a very dangerous one. What we can say, and I think must say, is that there must be a reconsideration of the relationship of the Executive and the Legislative branches, particularly the Execu\u00ad tive and the Senate in the conduct of for\u00ad eign relations, clari:fl.cation, and that both branches of the Government should, I think, search their souls, search the law, search history, and develop the resources of joint programs and joint policies, rather than the situation which now confronts us. That is Mr. Commager's comment on this issue. Mr. RUSSELL. I think there is a great deal of merit in that statement. I think its application is not limited, however, to the situation in Vietnam. I think the exercise of the powers of the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary might well be reviewed generally, in an effort to take this country back to the proper separation of powers and the proper weighing of our system of: checks and balances, which have enabled us to achieve our present greatness. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I agree with the Senator on that point. If I may digress a bit, a proposal which appeals to me-though I do not wish to commit myself on the issue this soon\u00ad is the movement for sharing of revenues with the States, not because I particu\u00ad larly like the procedure, but because I do not know of a better way to reestab\u00ad lish the powers of the States, powers which they lost because of financial diffi\u00ad culties they have encountered. Mr. RUSSELL. In times of war, we have restricted many of the States sources of revenue because of the war emergency, and after the war, we seldom give it back to them. Mr. FULBRIGHT. That is correct. The Senator from Pennsylvania has an amendment pending which deals with the subject of congressional consideration of a declaration of war. I feel very strongly the criticism which Mr. Commager has laid at the door of the Senate, that we are responsible, hav\u00ad ing abdicated to a great degree our au\u00ad thority under the Constitution. I wish to say that I take full responsibility for my part, because at the time of the Sen\u00ad ate's consideration of the southeast Asia resolution, I was unaware of the actual significance of the measure. I wish to make it clear for the record that I did not originate the resolution, al\u00ad though a number of newspaper writers have written as if it was my idea. It was sent up here by the administration. Mr. RUSSELL. I will bear witness to that. We had a meeting in the omce of the majority leader and discussed it, be\u00ad fore it was proposed by the executive branch, and that is when I suggested language permitting termination by con-. current resolution. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator is correct. I regret that I was not more aware then of the significance of t.he proposal. I remind the Senator that we were in the midst of initiating a political campaign and there was great public in\u00ad terest in the positions of the two can\u00ad didates. I confess that I was somewhat partisan in my views at that time, so I was inclined to accept the views of the President without too much criticism. I accepted the resolution and defended it on the floor, much to my regret. Not that the resolution could have been stop\u00ad ped. But it could have been debated on the basis that I think the Senate should debate this matter now: Are our policies wise and proper? We have precedents for such debate. I voted, as the Senator will remember, against the Middle East resolution some\u00ad what on the same grounds--that Con\u00ad gress should not delegate, in advance, powers which the President did not need, in my opinion,\u00b7 but where the effect of the action would be to preclude criticism because Congress took a position in ad\u00ad vance. This question was also raised at the time of the Formosa resolution, again in President Eisenhower's administration. Mr. RUSSELL. That is correct; and it was debated at some .length. Mr. FULBRIGHT. At considerable length. 4716 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 Mr. RUSSELL. Senators will remem\u00ad ber that when it was raised, the question of congressional approval of sending the five divisions to bolster the NATO forces was debated on the fioor of the Senate for 2 or 3 weeks. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I was coming to that point. The Senator played a part in that debate, and I think Congress cer\u00ad tainly discharged its duties much better then than it did in its consideration of this resolution. I suppose it might properly be said that it is a little late for me to bring up the question of the Tonkin Gulf resolu\u00ad tion now. All I can say is that U is better late than never. That is why I raise these questions at this time. Mr. RUSSELL. It may be belated, but-- Mr. FULBRIGHT. I have learned a number of things in the last few months that I did not know then. Mr. RUSSELL. It is never out of or\u00ad der, or out of season, or an improper time to discuss the question of the con\u00ad stitutionality of any action, as far as I am concerned. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I think I would agree with the Senator on that. Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield for a ques\u00ad tion. I have not completed my inter\u00ad rogatories to the Senator from Georgia. Mr. SCOTT. I understand. I am merely seeking clarification; that is the reason I rise while the colloquy is going on. Is the Senator advocating a declara\u00ad tion of war, or not? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I am raising the constitutional question regarding the present war, and laying the basis for taking a position on the amendment which has been submitted that the num\u00ad ber of troops in Vietnam should not be increased above 500,000 without a dec\u00ad laration of war. At some point, it seems to me, we should either recognize the congressional responsibility, or acknowledge that the constitutional requirement is no longer of any effect. I do not know what that point is. But the troop strength in Viet\u00ad nam has risen above 400,000. As the Senator from Georgia has stated, it is no longer a sudden action; it no longer qualifies as a sudden emergency, which we all admit the President has the power to respond to. He has, of course, done on numerous occasions in the past. I simply seek to raise questions now that I feel I should have raised before, for discussion with the distinguished Senator from Georgia. Mr. SCOTT. The Senator might run into one of the old maxims of equity, which says that he who would not when he could cannot when he would. How\u00ad ever, I would not think that would apply here; we all should have the opportunity to come in later.- Mr. FULBRIGHT . And confess our sins. Mr. SCOTT. That is correct. I am merely in the colloquy for the purpose of clarifying the matter. I wonder if the Senator would not agree that his view has been for some time-and I agree with him-that this is a deplorable war. However, his fur\u00ad ther view, as I understand it, is that it ought to be ended as soon as a way can be found to end it. If that is the case, would not a decla\u00ad ration of war make it much more difficult to end this war and aggression, bearing in mind that if we do not have a declara\u00ad tion of war, the conclusion of this war may be that it ends not with a bang, but with a whimper and that the aggressor fades away into the bush, and suddenly there is nobody to fight with anybody else? That is one way that it can be ended. If we formalize it with a declaration of war and let it go through all of the stages, including an armistice or a treaty with years passing between the armistice and the final peace treaty, would we not run into the argument that once we declare a war and there is an uncon\u00ad ditional surrender, we are moving into a morass which we can avoid by the very vagueness of the existing situation in which, as I understand our policy, we are asked to repel aggression in response to certain national commitments. I am not trying to argue with the Senator. I am just trying to clarify the matter. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The last state\u00ad ment is a very strong statement, and I do not accept it. We are there because we made a ter\u00ad rible mistake in judgment in the past. I would like to see the Nation confess its mistakes in judgment like I am willing to confess mine. This is not a declaration of war, but it is a warning that if the escalation is con\u00ad tinued, consideration should be given to a declaration of war. If we have any regard at all for the Constitution, this should be done. This war is not the repelling of a \"sudden attack,\" as the Founding Fathers had in mind when they debated this provision of the Constitution. The Constitution says that we should declare war if we are involved in a con\u00ad fiict that amounts to a war. I am familiar with the theory that the war may just dwindle away. Our present Ambassador to Vietnam advanced the same theory before the committee some 2 or 3 years ago. Others have made the same predictions but it has not worked that way, and the war has grown steadily larger. We have had many other prophesies from other administration officials. I could argue just as well that if Con\u00ad gress adopted this amendment and the administration were confronted with the necessity of asking for a declaration of war or maintaining military strength at 500,000, and they did hold at that level, that this would be a move toward dees\u00ad calation, or at least a halt in the escalation. The amendment promotes a settlement short of a military victory. The Senator knows-and I have no objection to this matter with him after I complete my statement-that I have advocated a negotiated settlement in contrast to what I believe to be the ad\u00ad ministration's policy of trying to achieve a military victory. I think a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of this country, and is more likely to create conditions for a durable peace. I, therefore, think a policy of seeking a negotiated end to the war is wiser. So, I have advocated that we seek a ne\u00ad gotiated settlement, in the nature of a compromise, rather than a military vic\u00ad tory. Mr. SCOTT. Would not a declaration of war get in the way of a negotiated settlement? Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator from Pennsylvania does not say that we should declare war either. It says that we should not increase our forces in Viet\u00ad nam above 500,000 and, if we do, there should be a declaration of war. Mr. SCOTT. Which is really the same thing. Mr. FULBRIGHT. It is not the same thing. Mr. SCOTT. Do we not all recognize that there will be escalation? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not recog\u00ad nize the necessity for it. I recognize that we are moving that way because of an unwise policy, as I have been trying to make clear on a number of occasions. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not want to keep the Senator standing on his feet. Mr. RUSSELL. I am enjoying the dis\u00ad cussion as long as I am not compelled to participate in it. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I will yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania then, per\u00ad haps ask the Senator a few more ques\u00ad tions, if the Senator feels that way about it. I did not know whether he was en\u00ad joying the discussion or not. Mr. CLARK. I say to my Colleague that I think he knows perfectly well the thrust of my amendment. It is an ef\u00ad fort to exercise the power of the purse to force the administration to fish or cut bait. I believe, if we are going to escalate the war, that the honorable as well as the constitutional thing to do is to ask Con\u00ad gress for a declaration. I am far from sure, if the President 'were to ask for that declaration, that I would vote for it, but I think there is\u00b7 es\u00ad sentially hypocrisy in our present system which I deplore. \u00b7Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I am not entirely enlightened, but reasonably so. I do thank the Senator very much. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I thank-the Sena\u00ad tor. These questions are really for. the record because the answers -from the Senator from Georiga have special importance. '. \u00b7 Does the Senator from Georgia believe that within our constitutional frame\u00ad work the President, as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces, has unlimited power to commit this Nation to war \u00b7 Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. President, that is a ditncult question to answer categori\u00ad cally. Mr. FULBRIGHT. It is for me, too. Mr. RUSSELL. I do not think it was contemplated by the Founding Fathers that the President would commit the Na\u00ad tion to unlimited war except that which might arise from resisting aggression. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Aggression aga.in.srt us or another country? \u00b7 February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4717 Mr. RUSSELL. To defend the United States or its vital interests or our citi\u00ad zens. We do have the Tonkin Gulf resolu\u00ad tion. The Senator from Arkansas may be unhappy about the fact that the Ton\u00ad kin Gulf joint resolution was ever passed, but it was passed and he was its manager on the floor at the time it passed. I think if Congress wishes to assert its authority, the proper way to do it is to in\u00ad troduce a concurrent resolution to annul the Tonkin Gulf joint resolution. I must say that I think one of the pending amendments is about as awk\u00ad ward an approach to the matter as could possibly be conceived. In other words, if we should commit more men than 500,000, even to defend those who are already there or to enable them to be withdrawn in case the war should be vastly increased by attack from some other forces in that\u00b7 area, the Congress would be on record against such action without a declaration of war. We are in\u00ad volved in a war now. It was started. It does no good to recite the history and ignite recriminations, but in the admin\u00ad istration of Dwight D. Eisenhower we sent military personnel to South Viet\u00ad nam for the first time. When it was ap\u00ad parent that the training cadres were not sufficient, it was decided to provide t\\inerican advisers with the South Viet\u00ad namese forces. Mr. FULBRIGHT. That was not with any approval of Congress. That was done as an Executive act. -Mr. RUSSELL. That was all Executive action, but Congress did not undertake to exercise its powers to cause the Ex\u00ad ecutive to cease and desist, and in that we were all culpable. No one was more strongly opposed than I to ever becoming involved on the mainland of Asia. After our experience in Korea, it seemed to me that if we be\u00ad came involved there it would be very difficult to get out. Even if there were later agreement on some kind of settle\u00ad ment, it seemed clear that it would be difficult to extricate ourselves and to bring all our forces home. I was opposed to it. Mr. FULBRIGHT. But did the Sena\u00ad tor bring that up on the floor of the Senate at the time? Mr. RUSSELL. No. I think the Sen\u00ad ator from Arkansas was at the confer\u00ad ence we had at the State Department. At that time we were led to believe that the administration had dropped the idea of intervening in anyway in Vietnam. Mr. Dulles and Admiral Radford were there. The President was not there. As I recall, he was ill at that time. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not believe I was there. I remember a session when they were talking about putting 35,000 men into Laos, and the Senator from Georgia and I think every Member of Congress who was there said \"Don't do it.\" Mr. RUSSELL. That was some time later. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator from Georgia remembers that. Mr. RUSSELL. Yes, I recall. The \u00b7conference to which the Senator refers was at the White House. Mr. FULBRIGHT. x\u00b7 was a J\u00b7unlor member of Foreign Relations at the time of the meeting to which he refers. Mr. RUSSELL. The Senator has always been a leader in foreign rela\u00ad tions. He came into fame as a very junior Member of the other body through the Fulbright resolution, one of the his\u00ad toric documents that Congress has pro\u00ad duced in this generation. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I wish we would return to the spirit of that resolution rather than pursue the course we are following in Vietnam, since the Senator from Georgia has mentioned it. Mr. RUSSELL. Now that we have condoned and supported these opera\u00ad tions to the present extent, I certainly do not favor any sense-of-the-Senate reso\u00ad lution that should cut back on the mili\u00ad tary action there by shutting off the bombing, or that would suggest we should not bombard the routes of in\u00ad vasion into South Vietnam, or that would disapprove any other tactic short of landing men in North Vietnam. I am strongly opposed to any invasion of North Vietnam. I am opposed to a declaration of war at this stage of the proceedings because I do not know what treaties may exist with some of the powerful nations of that area, some of the large Communist states, such as the Soviet Union and China. There may be a provision in a treaty under which a formal declaration of war would trigger an escalation much greater than anything that the United States is even remotely contemplating there. I see no reason, at this late date, to tempt the fates by declaring war. The results could be very damaging. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not want the Senator to leave the impression that I am proposing a declaration of war. This proposal is really an indirect way of say\u00ad ing, \"Do not increase the number of people.\" I believe the Senator said-I do not wish to misquote him-that if there should be a vast increase in our forces in Vietnam, he would not want this declaration of war. In effect, in answer to my question, if the number there grows far beyond what it is now, if it becomes a million men, then the Seinator st111 would not want a declaration of war. Mr. RUSSELL. No, I would not. I do not want to send a million men there. But I do not see that this Nation or our people would have one thing to gain by a declaration of war, and I can see a great many things we might lose. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Is it not fair to say that\u00b7 the Senator has accepted the principle that the power o\"f Congress to declare war, as written in the Constitu\u00ad tion, is obsolete? Mr. RUSSELL. No, I do not think so. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Why is that not a fair statement? Mr. RUSSELL. When I followed the Senator on the Tonkin Gulf joint resolu\u00ad tion, I think I absolved myself of de\u00ad claring it completely obsolete. I shall read the resolution: VIETNAM Whereas naval units of the Communist regime in Vietnam, 1n violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law, have dellberately and repeatedly at\u00ad tacked United States naval vesaela lawtull7 present in international waters, and have thereby created a serious threat to inter\u00ad national peace; Whereas these attacks are part of a delib\u00ad erate and systematic campaign of aggression that the Communist regime in North Viet\u00ad nam has been waging against its neighbors and the nations joined with them in the collective defense of their freedom; Whereas the United States is assisting the peoples of southeast Asia to protect their freedom and has no territorial, military or political ambitions in tha.t area but desires only that they should be left in peace to work out their own destinies in their own way; now therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep\u00ad resentativ~s of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Congress ap\u00ad proves and supports the determination of the President, as Commander in Chief, to take all necessary measures to repel any armed a.ttack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression. SEc. 2. The United Sta-tes regards as vital to its national interest and to world peace the maintenance of international peace and security in southeast Asia- It was difficult for me to accept' that particular sentence, but I did. I was persuaded- consonant with the Constitution and the Charter of the United Nations and in accord\u00ad ance with its obligations under the South\u00ad east Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the United States is, therefore, prepared, as the President determines, to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any protocol or member state or the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty re\u00ad questing assistance in defense of its freedom. This resolution shall expire when the President shall determine that the peace and security of the area is reasonably assured by international conditions created by action of the United Nations or otherwise, and shall so report to the Congress, except that it may be termlna.ted earlier by a concurrent reso\u00ad lution of the two Houses. Now, that is almost a declaration of limited war in itself, for the purposes of that re'solution. I doubt not that there have been times when Senators have regretted voting for legislative proposals. I know that I have. There are a number of votes that I would change, if I could go back and\u00b7 if I had the benefit of hindsight to com\u00ad pensate for the lack of foresight. But we are in this conflict now, and I fail to see where it can possibly bene\u00ad fit this country in the slightest degree for Congress to vote a formal declara\u00ad tion of war. On the other side of the coin, I can see a great deal of harm that could flow from such action. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I wish to point out again that I am not proposing a declara\u00ad tion of war. What the amendment really proposes is to develop some con\u00ad gressional restraints on escalation. In my opinion, the effect of its adoption would be a restraint upon escalation, not a declaration of war. Mr. RUSSELL. It would be a reduc\u00ad tion of American effort, because it would immediately stop the bombing of North Vietnam. Mr. FULBRIGHT. There are two res\u00ad .olutions. Mr. RUSSELL. No. Mr. FULBRIGHT. It is in the same one, but I am talking about the declara\u00ad tion of war portion. Mr. RUSSELL. If we continue opera-4718 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 tions over North Vietnam or if we as\u00ad sign more than 500,000 persons to South Vietnam, the amendment would express the sense of the Senate that there should be a declaration of war. We have sent those men out there. They did not go out there on a holiday tour. If most of them had their \"druthers.\" they would not be there. Mr. FULBRIGHT. If I had mine, they would not be there either .. Mr. RUSSELL. They are there by au\u00ad thority of this Government, and I do not propose to vote for anything that cuts back operations there by any degree. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I ask that certain portions of the debate in the Senate on August 6 and 7. 1964, on the southeast Asia resolution be in\u00ad serted in the RECORD, as they bear upon my understanding of the inte~t of that resolution. There being no objection, the excerpts . were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: Mr. BREWSTER. Mr. President, will the Sen\u00ad ator yield? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield. Mr. BREWSTER. I had the opportunity to see warfare not so very far from this area, and it was very mean. I would look with great dismay on a situation involving the landing of large land armies on the \u00b7con\u00ad tin-ent of Asia. So my question is whether there is anything in the resolution which would authorize or recommend or approve the landing of large American armies in Vietnam or in China. Mr. FuLBRIGHT. There is nothing in the resolution, as I read it that contemplates it. I agree with the Senator that that is the last th1ng we would want to do. However, the language of the resolution would not prevent it. It would authorize whatever the Qom\u00ad mander in Chief feels is necessary. It does not restrain the Executive from doing it. Whether or not that should ever be done is a matter of wisdom under the circumstances that exist at the particular time it is con\u00ad templated. This kind of question should more properly be addressed to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Speaking for my own committee, everyone I have heard has said that the last thing we want to do is to become involved in a land war in Asia; \u00b7that our power is sea and air and that this is what we hope will deter the Chinese Com\u00ad munists and the North Vietnamese from spreading the war. That is what is contem\u00ad plated. The resolution does not prohibit that or any other kind of activity. Mr. BREWSTER. I thank the distinguished chairman. Mr. MORTON . Mr. President, will the Sen\u00ad ator yield? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield. Mr. MoRTON. 'Mr. President, first I say to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas that I approve the action that bas been taken, and I approve this resolution. On the matter which was the subject of the colloquy between the chairman of the Foreign Rela\u00ad tions Committee and the distinguished Sen\u00ad ator from Louisiana, can we not associate our presence in the Gulf of Tonkin to a degree with our own interpretation of our obliga\u00ad tions under the SEATO Treaty? Mr. FuLBRIGHT. Yes. I made mention of it. That is a further responsib111ty that we undertook in alining ourselves with other countries in trying to bring peace and stabil\u00ad ity into this area. 'I'hat was another obliga\u00ad tion which we undertook. It fortifies our right or responsibility for being in the Gulf of Tonkin. Mr. MORTON. I believe the action taken by the President helps to avoid any miscalcula\u00ad tion on the part of either the North Viet-namese or the Chinese Communists. I be\u00ad lieve the joint resolution gives that policy further strength. In my opinion, the three majo;r wars in which we have been involved in this century have come about by miscal\u00ad culation on the part of the aggressor. \u00b7 I believe Congress should speak loud and clear and make it plain to any would-be ag\u00ad gressor that we intend to stand here. If we make that clear, we will avoid war, and not have to land vast land armies on the shores of Asia. In that connection I share the ap\u00ad prehension of my friend the Senator from Maryland [Mr. Brewster]. Mr. FuLBRIGHT. The Senator has put it very clearly. I interpret the joint resolution in the same way. This action is limited, but very sharp. It is the best action that I can think of to deter an escalation or enlarge\u00ad ment of the war. If we did not take such ac\u00ad tion, it mlght spread further. If we went further and ruthlessly bombed Hanoi and other places, we would be guilty of bad judgment, both on humanitarian grounds and on policy grounds, because the.n we would certainly inspire further retaliation. This situation has been handled in the best way possible under the circumstances so as to calm the situation, and not escalate it into a major war. \u00b7- Mr. NELSON. I could not hear all the col\u00ad loquy between the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Fulbright] and the Senator from Iowa [Ml'. Miller]. I heard a part of it. As I understand the mission of the United States in South Vietna-m for the past 10 years, stating it in the negative, has not been to take over the Government of South Vietna-m, an~. has not been to provide mili\u00ad tary forces to do battle in place of South Vietnamese forces. To sta,te it in the posi\u00ad tive sense, our mission has been to supply a military cadre for training personnel, and advisory military personnel as well as equip\u00ad ment and materiel-our objective being to help in the establishment of an independent stable regime. And, if my memory is right, we had about 1,000 troops ther9\" the first 5 or 6 years, up to 1960. There are now ap\u00ad proximately 16,000 troops there. In a-ddi\u00ad tion, it is now proposed that this number be expanded to, I believe, 21,000. Looking at sentences of the resolution, I understood it to be the position of the Sena\u00ad tor from Iowa [Mr. Miller] tha,t Congress is saying to the President that we would ap\u00ad prove the us.e of any might necessary in order to prevent further aggression. Am I to un\u00ad derstand that it is the sense of Congress that we a,re saying to the executive branch: \"If it becomes necessary to prevent further aggression, we agree now, in a-dvance that you may land as many divisions as deemed necessary, and engage in a direct military assault on North Vietnam if it becomes the judgment of the Executive, the Commander in Chief, that this is the only way to prevent further aggression\"? Mr. FuLBRIGHT. As I sta-ted, section 1 is intended to deal primarily with aggression against our forces. \"That the Congress ap\u00ad proves a,nd supports the determination of the President, as Commander in Chief, to ta-ke all necessary \u00b7 measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States a,nd to prevent further aggression.\" This means to me that it is with regard to our own forces. I believe section 2 deals with the SEATO area, which we are com\u00ad mitted to protect under our treaties, parti\u00ad cularly when they ask for our assistance. If the situation should deteriorate to such an extent that the only way to save it from going completely under to the Communists would be action such as the Senator sug\u00ad gests, then that would be a grave decision on the part of our country as to whether we should confine our activities to very limited personnel on land and the extensiv.e use of naval and air power, or whether we should go further and use more manpower. I personally feel it would be very unwise under any circumstances to put a large land army on the Asian Continent. It has been a sort of article of fa,ith ever since I have been in the Senate, that we should never be bogged down. We particu\u00ad larly stated that after Korea. We are mobile, we are powerful on the land and on the sea. But whEm we try to confine ourselves and say that this resolution either prohibits or authorizes such action by the Commander in Chief in. defense of this country, I believe that is carrying it a little further than I would care to go. I do not know what the limits are. I do not think this resolution can be determina\u00ad tive of that fact. I think it would indicate that he would take reasonable mea,ns first to prevent any further aggression, or repeal \u00b7 further aggression against \u00b7our own forces, and that he Will live up to our obligations under the SEATO Treaty and with regard to the protocol states. I do not know how to a-nswer the Senator's question and give him an absolute assurance that lai:ge numbers . of troops would not be put ashore. I would deplore it. And I hope the conditions do\u00b7 not justify it now. Mr. NELSON. We may very well not be able to nor attempt to control the discretion that is vested in the Commander in Chief. Bu't the joint resolution is before the Senate, sent to us, I assume, at the request of the executive branch. Mr. FuLBRIGHT. The Senator is correct. Mr. NELSON. It was sent to the Congress, in order to ascertain the sense of the Congress on the question. I intend to support the joint resolution. I do not think, however, that Congress should leave the impression that it consents to a radical change in our mission or objective in South Vietnam. That mission there for 10 years, as I have under\u00ad stood it, has been to aid in the establishment of a viable, independent regime which can manage its own affairs, so that ultimately we can withdraw from South Vietnam. Mr. President, we have been at the task for 10 years. I am not critizing the original decision to go into South Vietnam. I do not know how long that commitment should be kept in the event we are unable to accom\u00ad plish our mission. And I would not wish to make a judgment on that question now. But I would be most concerned if the Congress should say that we intend by the joint reso\u00ad lution to authorize a complete change in the mission which we have had in South Vietna-m for the past 10 year, and which we have repeatedly stated was not a commit\u00ad ment to engage in a direct land confronta\u00ad tion with our Army as a substitute for the South Vietnam Army or as a substantially reinforced U.S. Army to be joined with the South Vietnam Army in a war against North Vietna,m a,nd possibly China. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, it seems to me that the joint resolution would be con\u00ad sistent with what we have been doing. We have been assisting the countries in south\u00ad east Asia' in pursuance of the trea.ty. But in all frankness I cannot say to the Senator that I think the joint resolution would in any way be a deterrent, a prohibition, a lim\u00ad itation, or an expansion of the President's power to use the Armed Forces in a different way or more extensively tha,n he is now using them. In a broad sense, the joint resolution states that we approve of the action taken with regard to the attack on our own ships, and that we also approve of our country's effort to maintain the independence of South Vietnam. The Senator from Wisconsin prompts me to make a remark which perhaps I should not make. He has said that we might be mistaken in our action. If any mistake has been made--and I do not assert that it has \u00b7 been the only questionable area is whether or not we should ever have become involved. That question goes back to the begln~ng of action in this area, and I do not believe lt February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4719 is. particularly pertinent or proper to the debate, because in fact we have become in\u00ad volved. However, the Senator has mentioned It. A13 an academic matter, the question might be raised. But having gone as far as we have in 10 years, It seems to me that the question now is, How are we to control the situation in the best interest of our own security and that of our allies? I believe that what we did was appropriate. The joint resolution is appropriate, because it would fortify the strength of the Executive and the Government. It would put the Congress on record-and we are the most representative body that we have under our system-as supporting the action. If anything will deter aggression on the part of the North Vietnamese and the Chinese, I believe it would be the action taken together with the joint resolution supporting the action. That is the best I can do about justification of the resolution. In frankness, I do not be\u00ad lieve the joint resolution would substantially alter the President's power to use whatever means seemed appropriate under the cir\u00ad cumstances. Our recourse in Congress would be that if the action were too inappropriate, we could terminate the joint resolution by a concurrent resolution, and that would pre\u00ad cipitate a great controversy between the Executive and the Congress. As a practical question, that could be done. Mr. NELSON. I have a couple of addition\u00ad al questions. But first I wish to say that I did not suggest that by the use of hindsight I would now conclude that the intervention in 1954 was wrong. I do not know. I under\u00ad stand the necessity for the United States, since it is the leader of the free world, to do all it can in furtherance of the protection of the idea of freedom and independence, and that, to do so, we must take gambles. We shall lose some; we shall win some. I belleve the public is slow to recognize that we have vast responsib111ties, and they ex\u00ad pect us to win every gamble that we take. I do not expect that. And I do not now rise here to criticize the original decision. But I am concerned about the Congress appearing to tell the executive branch and the public that we would endorse a com\u00ad plete change in our mission. That would concern me. Mr. FuLBRIGHT. I do not interpret the joint resolution in that way at all. It strikes me, as I understand it, that the joint reso\u00ad lution is quite consistent with our existing mission and our understanding of what we have been doing in South Vietnam for the last 10 years. Mr. NELSON. Did I correctly understand the Senator from Arkansas to say a while ago that the language of the resolution is aimed at the problem of further aggression against our ships and our naval facilities? Mr. FuLBRIGHT. I think that is the logical way to interpret the language. It makes reference to the armed attack against the forces of the United States which has just taken place, and to prevention of further ag .. gression against our forces. Then the joint resolution passes on to our obligations under the treaty, which involves other countries. I believe also that it is implicit, if not ex\u00ad plicit, in the next section that the intent is to prevent the continuing aggression that now exists against South Vietnam. Mr. FuLBRIGHT. This provlsion is intended to give clearance to the President to use his discretion. We all hope and believe that the President will not use this discretion arbitrarily or irresponsibly. We know that he is accustomed to consulting with the Joint Chiefs of Statr and with congressional lead\u00ad ers. But he does not have to do that. Mr. COOPER. I understand, and believe that the President will use this vast power with judgment. Mr. FuLBRIGHT, He intends to do it, and he has done lt. Mr. CooPER. I do not wish to take more time now, because the distinguished Senator from Georgia wishes to speak, and I wa.nt to hear him. Mr. FuLBRIGHT. I have no doubt that the President wlll consult with Congress in case a major change in present policy becomes necessary. Mr. MCGOVERN. What I am getting at is, suppose the Government of South Vietnam, for whatever reason, should decide to launch a major military attack on North Vietnam, would we be obligated in any kind of arrange\u00ad ment we have with South Vietnam? Mr. FuLBRIGHT. No. We have no obligation to follow through with a situation which we believe to be unwise, stupid, or silly. We could disavow it and withdraw and have nothing to do with it. We have no treaty agreement or any other agreement that I know of that binds us to follow through with tha,t. Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I note the pres\u00ad ence in the Chamber of the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Fulbright. We almost ex\u00ad hausted him yesterday in keeping him on the floor to answer questioils. I believe that a very important question is raised by Mr. Reston's article in the New York Times of this morning in respect to our relationship with the South Vietnamese Premier, General Khanh. Mr. Reston writes of the pattern which we followed in respect to the Formosa resolution in 1954. I know the inhibitions of secrecy and the effects upon national policy in all these respects. We may assume that our Government is tak~ ing the necessary precautions so that the broad support--to use a juridical term\u00ad which we would give to the President in respect to the extended operations of a mili\u00ad tary character in this area of the world, is not an action by which our freedom of con\u00ad trol may be taken away by actions to which the Khanh regime may commit us for prac\u00ad tical purposes. But we would have a rlght to assume in voting the joint resolution that our Government is taking the necessary pre\u00ad cautions to see that whatever commitment we undertake is our own, and that we shall not be forced into a position of broadening that commitment against our will because the country in whose interest we are working so hard will commit us beyond what we wish to be committed to as a praotical matter. In short, to be very practical, suppose we are faced with a situation in which the South Vietnamese position should be jeopardized by its own extension of the struggle beyond its own capacity to wage a successful war in North Vietnam. Then what would happen in terms of our commitment and the com\u00ad Initment which our President is empowered to undertake anyhow, but which we would support in the joint resolution? Mr. FULBRIGHT. As a practical question, there is the closest cooperation between the Government of South Vietnam and our rep\u00ad resentatives, particularly our Ambassador, General Taylor. I do not believe there is any probab1lity, or even a possibility, that they can commit us beyond what our own people believe to be in the interest of our common effort. There is some distinction between the present situation and the declared policy of Chiang Kai-shek during the time of the For\u00ad mosa resolution. A13 the Senator well knows, it was-and perhaps it still is-his declared intention to retake the mainland of China. That was a question of considerable concern. That government had quite a large army of its own, and perhaps had greater capabillties than presently exist in South Vietnam. I do not believe there is any substance to the fear that the Vietnamese could involve us beyond the point where we ourselves wish to be involved. I do not think a full scale or a substantial invasion or extension of the war without our approval and assistance could be mounted. No such invasion has been mounted. I do not know that there is any prospect of it. That is a question which I believe is in the field of tactics, on which I am not competent to comment at the mo\u00ad ment. But on the political aspect of the question, I do not think there is any sub\u00ad stance to the fear that the South Vietnamese may lead us down a road that we do not wish to travel. It is a question of judgment as to what is the wise road to follow, of course. The question will remain one of great dim\u00ad culty until it can be settled. I do not believe there is any reason for such a fear at the present time. I share with the Senator, as we all do, nervousness over these resolutions. I think it is caused by nervousness about war in general. It is not because of the specific in\u00ad dividual involved. We are all nervous about the expansion of the war. I know the Presi\u00ad dent is. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. JAviTs. Mr. President, will the Senator from I111nois yield 2 additional minutes to me, so that I might finish my colloquy with the Senator from Arkansas? Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. :President, I yield 2 min\u00ad utes to the Senator from New York. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I am sure the President shares our concern. Great concern and ap\u00ad prehension are always created by the break\u00ad ing out of violence in these areas. Mr. JA VITS. I should like to ask the Senator whether we have a right to feel satisfied that our Government has taken or will take the necessary precautions to see that we shall not be committed beyond the extent to which we wish to be committed by the local Govern\u00ad ment of South Vietnam i'tself. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I believe we have, both in the past and presently. I do not believe that there is any probab111ty of their going off and involving us where we do not wish to be in\u00ad volv~. I believe we can mainta.in complete control over our own commitments. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I have read the Record. There was some colloquy on the floor yesterday. I noticed that every Sen\u00ad ator who spoke had his own personal in\u00ad terpretation of what the joint resolution means. Our Senator yesterday stated for the Record that he understands the resolution to mean that there will be no more privileged sanctuaries. Another Sena~or interprets the resolution to mean that it would authorize the Chief executive to eliminate any aggression, future and present. Some Senators interpret this language to mean aggression against South Vietnam; others interpret it to mean aggres\u00ad sion directly against our military forces. Another Senator interpreted the joint resolution to mean that it is the sense of Congress that no change is suggested by Con\u00ad gress in the present mission in South Viet\u00ad nam-the mission that has been ours for 10 years, which is to supply advisers, technical advice, and material, for the purpose of at\u00ad tempting to encourage the establishment of an . independent, viable regime, so that we can withdraw our forces; and that it has not been our mission in the past 10 years to sub\u00ad stitute our military forces for the South Vietnamese forces, nor to join with them in a land war, nor to fight their battle for them, nor to substitute our Government for theirs. This 10-year-old limited mission can be legitimately defended as a responsib11ity of ours to assist free and independent nations; and it can be legitimately questioned too, because of the greographic location o! that mission. In any event, I am( most qisturbed to see 4720 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 that there 1s no agreement in the Senate on what the joint resolution means. I would like to see it clarified. If we are telling the public by this resolu\u00ad tion that it is our responsibillty to use our forces to win a. war in southeast Asia- \u00b7 The PREsiDING . OFFICER. The 5 minutes Of the Senator from Wisconsin have expired. Mr. NELSON. I ask the Senator from Oregon to yield me some time. Mr. MoRsE. Mr. President, I am willing to make a deal with the Senator from Arkansas. If I yield the Senator 4 minutes, will the Sen\u00ad ator from Arkansas yield him some time? Mr. FULBRIGHT. We have only 7 minutes. Mr.. DmKSEN. All the time for the quorum calls came out of our time. Mr. MoRsE. I did not ask that it come out of the time on the other side. I did not ask for any quorum call. I am willing to enter into a unanimous-consent agreement that the time taken for the quorum calls be not counted. Mr. DIRKSEN. Perhaps we should find out how the timekeeper can change the record. Mr. MoRSE. I specifically said I would re\u00ad serve time to yield to the Senator from Alaska. Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, a parlia\u00ad mentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it. Mr. DIRKSEN. Is it the understanding of the Chair that the last :J.our was to be equally divided between the two leaders for disposition as they saw fit; and is it also correct that the time for the quorum calls was taken out of our time? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unqer the unani\u00ad mous-consent agreement, 1 hour was to be divided between the leadership. Under the unanimous-consent agreement, at the re\u00ad quest of the Senator from Montana, the time used during the quorum calls was taken out of that 1 hour. Mr. MoRsE. I say most respectfully that quorums calls were asked for by the pro\u00ad ponents of the bill. Mr. DIRKSEN. What happened to my half hour? Mr. MoRsE. The proponents did not have any speakers for the resolution. That is why they suggested the absence of a quorum. Let us be frank about it. We have speakers against the resolution. I shall not deny my colleague from Alaska an opportunity to close the debate on the resolution. It is now 20 minutes to 1. Do Senators still wish to vote at 1 o'clock? How much time have I remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 15 minutes remaining. Very briefly let the Chair state that 1 hour was allotted to the majority leader and the mi\u00ad nority leader. It was not understood that the time was to be divided between them. Mr. MORSE. I will reserve 10 minutes of my time for the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Groen\u00ad ing]. The Senators from Arkansas and Illi\u00ad nois may have the rest of the time and use it as they see fit. Mr. DIRKSEN. Out of whose time is that to come? Mr. MoRsE. I have 15 minutes. I am re\u00ad serving 10 minutes for the Senator from Alaska. Mr. FuLBRIGHT. \u00b7we have 7 minutes. Mr. MoRsE. I will give the Senator 5 min\u00adutes of my time. Mr. NELSON. I wonder 1f the Senator would accept an amendment. Mr. MoRsE. I yield 5 minutes to the Sena\u00ad tor from Wisconsin, with the understanding that the time that I have reserved for the Senator from Alaska will be protected. The PRESIDING OFFicER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NELSON. In view of the differing inter\u00ad pretations which have been put upon the joint resolution with respect to what the sense of Congress Is, I should llke to have this point clarified. I have great confidence in the President. However, my concern is that we in Congress could give the impres\u00ad sion to the public that we are prepared at this time to change our mission and substantially expand our commitment. If that 1s what the sense of Congress is, I am opposed to the resolution. I therefore ask the distinguished Senator from Arkanas if he would consent to accept an amendment, a copy of which I have supplied him. I shall read it into the Record: On page 3, line 3, after the word \"That\" insert\" (a)\". On page 2, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following: \" (b) The CongresS also approves and sup\u00ad ports the efforts of the President to bring the problem of peace in southeast Asia to the Security Council of the United Nations, and the President's declaration that the United States, seeking no extension of the present military conflict, will respond to prov\u00ad ocation in a manner that is 'limited fitting.' Our continuing policy is to limit our role to the provision of aid, training assistance, and military advice, and it is the sense of Con\u00ad gress that, except when provoked to a greater response, we should continue to attempt to avoid a direct military invlovement in the southeast Asian conflict.\" This amendment is not an interference with the exercise of the President's constitu\u00ad tional rights. It is merely an expression of the sense of Congress. Would the Senator accept the amendment? Mr. FuLBRIGHT. It states fairly accurately what the President has said would be our policy, and what I stated my understanding was as to our policy; also what other Sena\u00ad tors have stated. In other words, it states that our response should be appropriate and limited to the provocation, which the Sena\u00ad tor states as \"respond to provocation in a manner that is limited and fitting,\" and so forth. We do not wish any political or mili\u00ad tary bases there. We are not seeking to gain a colony. We seek to insure the capacity of these people to develop along the lines of their own desires, independent of domina\u00ad tion by communism. The Senator has put into his amendment a statement of policy that is unobjectionable. However, I cannot accept the amendment under the circumstances. I do not believe it is contrary to the\u00b7 joint resolution, but it is an enlargement. I am informed that the House is now voting on this resolution. The House joint resolution is about to be pre\u00ad sented to us. I cannot accept the amendment and go to conference with it, and thus take responsibllity for delaying matters. I do not object to it as a \u00b7statement of policy. I believe it 1s an accurate reflection of what I believe is the President's policy, judging from his own statements. That does not mean that as a practical matter I can accept the amendment. It would delay mat\u00ad ters to do so. It would cause confusion and require a conference, and present us with all the other di1Hculties that are involved in this kind of legislative action. I regret that I cannot do it, even though I do not at all disagree with the amendment as a general statement of policy. Mr. NELSON. Judging by the Record of yesterday, many Senators do not interpret the resolution in the same way. Mr. FuLBRIGHT. Senators are entitled to have different views. However, most mem\u00ad bers of the committee, with one or two ex\u00ad ceptions, interpret it the same way. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Wisconsin has expired. Mr. FuLBRIGHT. Differences of interpreta\u00ad tion are necessarily always present. I think the Senator's statement is a fair statement. Mr. FULBRIGHT. For example, I quote from my remarks on August 7, 1964: I b~lieve the joint resolution is calculated to prevent the spread of the war rather than to spread it, as has been alleged by some critics of the resolution. This is, of course, what I was inter\u00ad preting to the Senate as having been told by the administration. But essentially the joint resolution is an exhibition of solidarity in regard to the will and determination of this country as a whole, as represented in Congress, to support the broad policies that have been well announced and well described in the words of the Pres\u00ad ident, both recently and in past months. We are exhibiting a desire to support those pol.;. icies. That will have a strong psychological effect upon our adversaries, wherever they may be. The Senator will recall that the Pres\u00ad ident at that time, in contrast to the Republican candidate, was taking the position that he was opposed to escala\u00ad tion. Mr. RUSSELL .. Absolutely. Mr. FULBRIGHT. And that is what I thought we were supporting. And I was supporting the President's policies, and I was very much opposed to theRe\u00ad publican candidate's policies. Mr. RUSSELL. There was nothing dovelike in the resolution. Mr. FULBRIGHT. No. The Senator recalls the circumstances at that time. It was the beginning of the campaign in 1964. But does the Senator believe that in adopting this resolution the Senate had any intention of giving advance approval for the President to involve the Nation in a conflict of this magnitude? Mr. RUSSELL. I cannot speak for the Senate. Personally, at that time I did not. contemplate anything of this magni\u00ad tude. I want to be perfectly honest with the Senator. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Neither did I. Mr. RUSSELl,. I was :first told by my distinguished colleague from Kentucky [Mr. MoRTON], who at that time was an Assistant Secretary of State, about the proposal to send some 200 or 400 men to Vietnam in the capacity of trainers. President Eisenhower was kind enough to advise me of his intention because of the strong position I had taken in op\u00ad position to it. I was apprised of it after the fact, but there was nothing I could have done if I had known of it before. Congress was out of session. Senator MoRTON came to Georgia and told me the technicians had been sent to Vietnam. I said that there was noth\u00ad ing I could do about it but that I re\u00ad gretted to hear it. I said, \"I think you are opening \u00b7UP a trail today that Will be costly in blood and treasure to this conntry, and that where there are 200 or 300 in Vietnam today there will be thousands there tomorrow.'' But I am frank to say that I did not expect the war to assume this magni\u00ad tude at the time we passed the resolu\u00ad tion. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator will, I think, admit that the common under\u00ad standing at the time has a bearing on the present issue. Does the Senator be\u00ad lieve that this resolution can stand con\u00ad stitutionally as a substitute for a con\u00ad gressional declaration of war? Mr. RUSSELL. What resolution? Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Gulf of Ton\u00ad kin resolution that we have been dis\u00ad cussing. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4721 Mr. RUSSELL. That is a nice con\u00ad stitutional question that I would have to consider. I think it amounts to a con\u00ad gressional approval of a state of war, if it is not a formal declaration of war. The Senator knows we have been en\u00ad gaged in a number of other very bloody and substantial wars without any formal declaration of war. The Korean war was the last one. The bloodiest war ever fought 'between citizens of the United States was fought without any formal declaration. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Does the Senator mean the Civil War? Mr. RUSSELL. I mean the Civil War. There were those in Congress at that time who wished to have a formal declaration made against the Southern States, and there were those in the Confederate Con\u00ad gress who wished to have a formal decla\u00ad ration made against the Union. For one reason or another they never did do it. I do not know why. I know that matter was discussed in both Congresses, in the Southern States and in the Union, but no formal declaration of war was made, and for 4 years that was the bloodiest war we ever had. I do not see how it can benefit this country by one iota to pass a formal declaration of war at this time. I would like to have one reason given as to how we would be benefited. Mr. FULBRIGHT. That is not the effect of this amendment. Mr. CLARK. The Senator is correct. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I interpret what the Senator said to mean that he believes the southeast Asia resolution is a consti\u00ad tutional substitute for a declaration of war. Is that a fair statement or not? Mr. RUSSELL. No, I don't think it is, but it is a legislative approval of the state of war that is there. Mr. FULBRIGHT. How can the Sen\u00ad ator say that logically when he said the present war was not in his mind. And he is the man most concerned with the military in the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appro\u00ad priations. If this present situation was not in his mind and not imagined or fore\u00ad seen, how can it have been approved in advance? Mr. RUSSELL. The Senator asked me a straightforward question: Did I contemplate at the time this resolution was passed that this war would ever as\u00ad sume the magnitude that it has today? Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator is correct. \u00b7 Mr. RUSSELL. I gave him an honest answer, and I told him I did not. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I agree with the Senator. \u00b7 Mr. RUSSELL. What bearing that has on this amendment I fail to see. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Maybe I can de\u00ad velop that later. I am trying to lay some groundwork. Mr. RUSSELL. Perhaps the Senator is laying a trap. . Mr. FULBRIGHT. No, I could not begin to lay a trap, even if I wanted to. The Senator is much more alert on Sena\u00ad torial procedure than I will ever be. I am trying to ask straightforward ques\u00ad tions on constitutionality. The Senator is a great student of the Constitution. Mr. RUSSELL. I thank the Senator. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I am trying to de\u00ad velop what the situation is on this con\u00ad stitutional issue. I hope he does not consider the questions to be unfair. This issue bothers a lot of people. Mr. RUSSELL. It causes all of us concern. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Constitution is still important in this country. Mr. RUSSELL. It causes me concern. The Korean war caused me concern whether we should pass a formal declara\u00ad tion of war. But I see nothing whatever to be gained by a declaration at this late date, and, therefore, I am opposed to it very strongly. I can see much more harm than good. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I would like to ask the Senator another question. A State Department legal memoran\u00ad dum, dated March 4, 1966, on the legality of. our involvement in Vietnam states: It may be suggested that a declaration of war is the only available constitutional proc\u00ad ess by which Congressional support can be made effective for the use of United States armed forces in combat abroad. But the Constitution does not insist on any rigid formalism. It gives Congress a choice of ways in which to exercise its powers. In the case of Viet Nam the Congress has supported the determination of the President by the Senate's approval of the SEATO Treaty, the adoption of the Joint Resolution of August 10, 1964, and the enactment of the necessary authorizations and appropriations. Does the Senator believe that any of these measures, singly or collectively, constitute a declaration of war against North Vietnam? Mr. RUSSELL. No, I do not think they constitute a declaration of war by the Congress. But the Senator knows as well as I that when treaties are approved by Congress they have all the force of the Constitution itself. When we give our approval to the President carrying out our obligations under a treaty, if such an obligation actually exists, I think this is a method of making war other than by formal declaration. Mr. FULBRIGHT. In the case of the Korean war we did have the formal treaty commitment of the United Na\u00ad tions Charter. That war was carried out under the auspices or authorization of the United Nations. Therefore, it meets the Senator's criteria. That is not the case with the Vietnam war. The war is not being carried out or sanctioned by the United Nations. There has not even been any formal col\u00ad lective action under the SEATO\u00b7 Treaty. The Senator will note that the quotation from the State Department memoran\u00ad dum does not allege that there has been formal SEA TO action. Mr. RUSSELL. This was not lost on me, and I had not read the memoran\u00ad dum. The first time I heard it was when the Senator read it. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I assure the Sena\u00ad tor that that is the correct quotation. Mr. RUSSELL. I do not challenge the Senator on that at all. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Does the Senator agree that there is much public uncer\u00ad tainty and frustration about this war? Mr. RUSSELL. I agree there is much uncertainty and frustration about any war. War is not a pleasant state of af\u00ad fairs. There is great frustration attend-ant on any war, even those smaller than this war. _ Mr. FULBRIGHT. Would the Sena\u00ad tor say the same thing about World War II; that there was uncertainty about our role; the same kind of division we have today? Mr. RUSSELL. I think there was greater frustration in World War II than today. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Really? Mr. RUSSELL. Yes; I do. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not recall that there were protests, at least not any similar to those we have today-in and out of Congress. Mr. RUSSELL. That was before the day when students exert such a tremen\u00ad dous influence on our Government. Back in those days, demonstrators would have been very unpopular. The police department would have \u00b7immediately locked them up and would have done so roughly. The police would have piled \u00b7them into the paddy wagons and dragged them off to jail. Today, how\u00ad ever, it is a different story, with cries of \"police brutality,\" and such, now that we have become such a sophisticated people. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Did we not have demonstrations in World War II? Mr. RUSSELL . Yes, there were dem\u00ad onstrations in World War II. Mr. FULBRIGHT. There was a for\u00ad mal declaration of war, which everyone accepted, was there not? I do not recall any substantial opposition to the war other than from a number of pacifists and conscientious objectors. There was no substantial criticism of the declara\u00ad tion of war, was there? Mr. RUSSELL. I do not recall much. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not recall any. Mr. RUSSELL. There was some, of course. Mr. FULBRIGHT. There is always some. Mr. RUSSELL. There were some 56 or 57 Members of Congress, I believe, who voted against a declaration of war in World War I-a considerable number of them, at any rate. There were very few who voted against a declaration of war in World War II. I believe Mrs. Jeanetlte Rankin voted against it. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arkansas yield for a brief observation? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I am glad to yield for a very brief statement. I should like to finish this colloquy. Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator. On that point, there was the IWW that called for a cessation, but they switched back and forth. But I remember that there were many demonstrations held by them, but they did not get the communi\u00ad cations attention that such demonstra\u00ad tions get today because we did not have any television then, or so vast a commu\u00ad nications media as today's press and ra\u00ad dio. So that whether it was to a greater or a lesser degree than it is today, would be very hard to say. From my personal experience, I can say that today many of the demonstra\u00ad tions which take place' are overexpanded in the communications media. Some\u00ad times we read that there were 2,000 pro\u00ad testors when actually there might have 4722 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 been only 200. I speak from experience at the recent visit of the Vice President. Mr. HUMPHREY. to Stanford University. There were some 6,000 persons present, I am told, and yet out of that number, only 200 were the troublemakers. Thus, it gets back to how big was the noise, which is hard to ascertain. Mr. MAGNUSON. There were a lot of draft-dodger cases. Mr. RUSSELL. Yes; many of them. They were men trying to escape the Se\u00ad lective Service draft, just as we have to\u00ad day. They are going to Canada today. In World War I and World War II, many of them went to Mexico. They went down there in large numbers. There were two young men, members of my high school class, who went down to Mexico to avoid service. I know that this ruined the lives of two very nice boys. Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arkansas yield? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I should like to complete my colloquy, but I yield to the Senator from Washington. Mr. MAGNUSON. I will be brief. Of course, in World War I, there were all kinds of demonstrations and marches . based upon the fact: Why were we going overseas to fight this war for democracy in Europe? There were parades up and down Fifth Avenue and every other place in the country. In proportion, there was almost as much unrest, but a little like the Senator from California has just pointed out, not much was said about it, the coverage was not the same as it 1s today. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arkansas yield for a 10- second observation? Mr. FULBRIGHT. In that connection. let me ask~ did this take place before or after the declaration of war? Mr. MAGNUSON. Both. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator will recall that Woodrow Wilson's campaign was run on the basis of opposition to the war and keeping America out of the war. Shortly thereafter we got into it and that caused an outcry. I, therefore, wonder whether the Senator is clear in his mind that after a declaration of war there was still great opposition to our participation in it. Mr. MAGNUSON. I can look it up in the record-- . Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not really re\u00ad member the facts, frankly. Mr. MAGNUSON. I happened to be reading an article recently. I will get it. I was not old\u00b7 enough to get into World War I. I tried to do so, but I could not make it. I remember seeing a newsreel in a small theater about these marches and it was after the declaration of war, because our troops were going overseas to fight a war that some people did not like for us to get involved in. It certainly was after the declaration. Mr. MURPHY. Will the Senator from Arkansas yield for one more observa\u00ad tion? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield to the Sen\u00ad ator from California. Mr. MURPHY. I was in World War I for 3 days. But, in my industry, the motion picture industry, we were asked to do whatever we could to make it pos\u00ad sible for this country w enter World War II. As I entered the Chamber wday I was commenting to one of my colleagues about a scene that we had been asked to insert into a picture we were making, in order to prove to the American people that the scene, which had to do with Maxim Litvinov and his visit to this cOIUiltry which was occurring at that time, should be publicized, in order to help friendship between the United States and Russia, which at that time it was hoped could be brought about. It was on this impulse that we tried to make it palatable to the American peo\u00ad ple. I do not think that anyone wants to go to war now, any more than he did before. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not wish to \u00b7prolong this coll()(j_uy, but it is history that the territory of the United States was directly and very violently attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. That beginning was quite different from the origin of this war. Mr. MAGNUSON. Surely. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I think we will all admit that. Mr. RUSSELL. There is no question about that. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Well, the Senator will recall the long debate in the Senate in 1951-he referred to it a moment ago -on the question of sending U.S. troops to Europe. I am sure that he will recall the Armed Services and Foreign Rela\u00ad tions Committees held lengthy joint hearings on the matter. In the light of the development concerning our involve\u00ad ment in Vietnam, I should like to have the Senator's comment on this portion of the joint committees' report which I believe had much to do with the Presi\u00ad dent's consulting with the appropriate congressional committees before ground troops were sent to NATO. The joint committee believes- The Senator from Georgia, I believe, was chairman of this joint committee. Mr. RUSSELL. I do not recall that. I do not believe I was, because as a rule I always yielded that distinction, to, I believe, the former Senator from Texas, Mr. Connally. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I was thinking the Senator was-- Mr. RUSSELL. The Senator from Texas, Mr. Connally. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I quote from the report: The joint committee believes that, in such important ma,tters which involve the secu\u00ad rity of the United States and world peace, the Congress should be kept informed of de\u00ad velopments and should be in a position to participate in the formulation of major policy steps. In this way the unity of pur\u00ad pose and action on the part of the Executive and the Congress so necessary to public understanding and the full cooperation of the American people will be assured. Does the Senator consider that to be a proper request to make of the execu- tive branch? . Mr. RUSSELL. I think there is noth\u00ad ing unreasonable in that request. I think that any President of the United States understands he has to live with Congress and that he would do well to keep Congress as well informed as he can, consistent with the limitation of the safety and security of the country. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Does the Senator think that there is now general public understanding of the Vietnamese war, the degree of understanding which was the object of this language in the joint committee's report? Mr. RUSSELL. I do not know what the degree of public understanding is throughout the country. The Senator has correctly stated that many people are opposed to this war. I think that Congress has been very well advised. The Senator certainly was of that opinion because he read from the debate. I wish to plrace in the RECORD the ex\u00ad change between the Senator from Ken\u00ad tucky [Mr. CooPER] and the chairman of the Committee on Floreign Relations, the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. FuL\u00ad BRIGHT], in which the Senator from Ken\u00ad tucky asked: Then, looking ahead, if the President decided that it was necessary to use such force as could lead into war, we will give that authority by this resolution? Mr. FuLBRIGHT. That is the way I would interpret it. If a situation later developed in which we though the approval should be withdrawn, it could be withdrawn by con\u00ad current resolution. That situati-on still exists. Any Sena\u00ad tor is at liberty to offer a concurrent resolution to withdraw any authority in the Tonkin Gulf resolution that he may think has been abused by the Chief Executive. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator cor\u00ad rectly reads that, and I do not know that I can say any more with regard w my own misguided actions-misguided be\u00ad cause I did not understand the situation properly. I misinterpreted the views of the President, and the significance of the resolution. I have said that on numer\u00ad ous occasions in public. What I have been trying to do-alone as well as collectively with other Mem\u00ad bers of the Senate-is to influence the policy of the administration toward a ne\u00ad gotiated settlement of the confiict in Vietnam, as contrasted to a military vic\u00ad tory. That is really all I propose. And it is really what the Senator from Penn\u00ad sylvania proposes. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, the Sena\u00adtor is correct. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I am trying to in\u00ad fluence the policy of the Government. Admitting that I have been mistaken in the past; admitting that this administra\u00ad tion and previous administrations--as the Senator has said, to his own knowl\u00ad edge-were mistaken in their initial-- Mr. RUSSELL. I am not above saying I have been mistaken. I have been mis\u00adtaken. Mr. FULBRIGHT The question now is, What is the wise course? There is plenty of fault to go around. The Senator from Georgia and I would both like the war to be brought to an end. The only difference between the Senator from Georgia and myself is over what is best calculated to bring it to an end, which policy will lead to a permanent disengagement. Some people seem to think it is not wise for us to disengage; February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4723 that it is our duty to stay in Vietnam as a counterbalance to China. Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield. _ Mr. SYMINGTON. Will the Senator define ''disengage\"? Mr. FULBRIGHT. Yes; to remove our physical presence from Vietnam and Thailand, and that we return to what I thought was our policy, relying on naval and air power to maintain whatever in\u00ad fluence is required in that area, rather than to establish and maintain perma\u00ad nent land bases. We used to have a policy, supported by such military authorities as General MacArthur and others, that was firmly opposed to getting this Nation involved in a land war in Asia. Mr. SYMINGTON. Suppose it in\u00ad volved our air and sea power against North Vietnam? Mr. FULBRIGHT. If there was prop\u00ad er provocation for it, I think we should use our air and sea power in whatever way was necessary, but not in such a manner as to establish a colony or a permanent base there. Both the Senator from Georgia and I have the same objective; the only dif\u00ad ference between us is over which is the best policy calculated to bring about dis\u00ad engagement, the removal of our military presence in the long run. I do not say immediately because I think working out the arrangements is going to be a com\u00ad plicated matter. This amendment is an attempt to try to influence discussion, and possibly bring about a reconsideration of policy by the administration. It obviously has a free hand to do pretty much as it pleases, but we can at least give advice. Mr. RUSSELL. We can adopt a con\u00ad current resolution terminating the au\u00ad thority in the previous resolution. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I think it would be impractical to do that. If the Sena\u00ad tor from Georgia could be persuaded to share my views, and so state them, this in itself could well bring about a change in the policy of this administration. His long prestige as the senior Member in this body in the field of armed services over a long period of years gives him great influence. If I could bring the Senator to share my views, that would cause the President to wonder whether he was following the right policy. . Mr. RUSSELL. May I say that the Senator has certainly rewarded me for the long time I have been on my feet by that laudatory statement. It is appre\u00ad ciated much more than it is deserved. I, of course, share the fervent hope, and even the prayer, for an honorable conclusion of hostilities at the earliest possible date. I do not think we are going to arrive at that happy state of affairs through a policy of deescalating the war. That is where I differ with the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. RUSSELL. I do not think we will hasten the day of peace by stopping the bombing in North Vietnam or by de\u00ad escalating the war. In my opinion, the only way we will arrive at a termination of hostilities will be through the same course of action we followed in Korea, and that is by keeping the pressure on North Vietnam until Ho Chi Minh con\u00ad cludes that he cannot possibly win and that it would serve his national interest to bring the war to a conclusion. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. RUSSELL. In just a moment. As I recall, within 3 or 4 days of the meet\u00ad ing at Panmunjom the Chinese were is\u00ad suing avowals every day that under no conditions would they talk about a ces\u00ad sation of hostilities as long as we had a military presence in Korea. But they did. They eventually came to talk about a cessation of hostilities, and we finally brought about a peace of a sort there in Korea. When we are able to ar\u00ad rive at negotiations in Vietnam, I hope we will do a better job than we did in Korea, because what we did there was more in the nature of an armistice than it was a permanent peace. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. RUSSELL. I yield. Mr. CLARK. I was wondering if the Senator believes we can win a military victory there. Mr. RUSSELL. I know we can if we want to apply the power there that we have. Mr. CLARK. Does the Senator advo\u00ad cate our doing that? Mr. RUSSELL. No. I have urged certain steps. I have urged naval bom\u00ad bardment. I am delighted that the ad\u00ad ministration has ordered it. I favor ex\u00ad tension of the air attacks until all their power facilities and whatever potential they have for making war are destroyed. But I am opposed to l,anding one Ameri\u00ad can soldier on the shores of North Viet\u00ad nam. I think the surest way to create a long period of host111ties of great magni\u00ad tude in that area would be to undertake to do what is being proposed here in some of these amendments. That is why I oppose them. Mr. CLARK. Does the Senator think further escalation and bombing of the north and further deployment of Amer\u00ad ican troops in the south, with continua\u00ad tion of the costly search-and-destroy mission, is going to bring the war to an end more quickly than if we do not pur\u00ad sue those aggressive tactics? Mr. RUSSELL. Yes, I .,;hink it will, and I think it will be done at a much lesser cost in American life than by an absolute prohibition on the number that can be engaged and by telling the enemy that- This number we are going to permit over there; you can bring down as many as you want--bring a mill1on, if you want to, from the North. We have put a limit at 500,000. That is an we wm have. If you can kill them all, you can achieve your end; and we are not going to bomb you; just keep on the roads and on the seas and bring in the army and all the forces you can, because we are not going to bring more than 500,000 troops into Vietnam. To me that does not make sense. We have been very slow in changing our policy. I have been critical of some policies of the administration. I think if they decide they are going to wage war, they should wage war. I must say I do not go along with the enclave theory that has been supported by the Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CLARK. The Senator will, of course- Mr. RUSSELL. I think it will just mean more American boys killed, that is all. Mr. CLARK. The Senator will, of course, permit me to disagree with him. Mr. RUSSELL. Oh, yes, of course. I knew the Senator would disagree. I just stated I disagreed with him. Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President will the Sen a tor yield?\u00b7 ' Mr. FULBRIGHT. I will yield briefly to the Senator. I am almost ready to conclude; I merely wish to say a few more words. Mr. SYMINGTON. One point that worries me. We talk about disengage\u00ad ment. The enclave theory, to the best of my knowledge, is opposed by every leading military man on active duty, without exception-Army, Navy, or Air. As the Senator defines disengagement, he does not agree does he, that we should retreat to a few centers in South Viet\u00ad nam, so as to let the enemy mass their attacks at will against remaining Amer\u00ad Ican troops. Mr. FULBRIGHT. General Gavin has discussed this theory twice. The Sena\u00ad tor says \"no one on active duty.\" I am glad that he used the word \"active.\" Generals Ridgway and Gavin, who made the study for President Eisenhower back in 1954 of possible American intervention in southeast Asia recommended against our entering the war at that time, I be\u00ad lieve. As the Senator knows, General Gavin came and testified before the For\u00ad eign Relations Committee only last week. Given the objective which I tried to state a moment ago, his theory makes more sense to me than unlimited escalation of the war. I foresee the possibility-and I do not like to run the risk-of inducing the Chinese to enter this war. Once that happens, as it did ill Korea, it will become a very different kind of conflict, one which would be extremely difficult to end on any honorable basis except through an all-out, very costly war. I do not think our vital interests are involved there. As I said a while ago there are all kinds of complications to the situation in Vietnam. Yesterday very important people from the administra\u00ad tion called upon me to talk about NATO. They urged me not to go along with the resolution of the majority leader, which I had already publicly stated I favored. This war brings on all sorts of compli\u00ad cations. This incident ties in with Gen\u00ad eral Gavin's testimony. Last year, as the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri remembers, General Gavin made a major point of the overcommitment of our military forces. The Senator from Missouri, too, has taken that line, from a somewhat different angle. Mr. SYMINGTON. The Senator is correct. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I think this is a part of that picture. Mr. SYMINGTON. I said so as far back as last April. I think this country is overcommitted around the world. Mr. FULBRIGHT. If there were only 4724 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- \u00b7 SENATE February \u00b7 28, 1967 Vietnam in the commitment picture, if that were the only responsibility we had-if we did not have the NATO com\u00ad mitment, for example-and had very little prospect of other engagements, I might favor a different approach. After putting all of the pieces together, it seems to me the interests of this country are not served by the great cost of this war in lives, and money, and by the risk we are taking of becoming involved in an unlimited war with China. I do not believe that North Vietnam wishes to be a satellite, or in any way controlled by China. But I think we are gradually forcing her into the position of having to make a choice between us and the Chinese. Reluctantly she would probably take the Chinese, and ask them to come in. Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield. Mr. SYMINGTON. After personally investigati.rig through all the windows we have to China, from Japan to Hong Kong on down, I found no one who felt that any amount of bombing, even the bombing of civilian housing which no\u00ad body wishes to do, would bring in tl_le Chinese-no member of the State De:.. partment, no member of the CIA, and no member of the military. On the other hand, about half felt that landing ground troops in southern North Vietnam would bring in the Chinese; and everybody, in all three of those departments, felt that any ground troop landing around Hanoi or Haiphong would bring in the Chinese. What worries me greatly is this con\u00ad stant steady attack on any qualitative utilization of air power and sea power. About this I completely agree with the Senator from Georgia-through air\u00ad power and seapower there is a greater chance of bringing the North Vietnamese to the conference table than if we con\u00ad tinue this fight on the ground. That is why it is so disturbing to have people I respect, like the Senator from Pennsyl\u00ad vania, constantly criticizing any bomb\u00ad ing, but apparently would support the idea-to me a guarantee of heavy addi\u00ad tional loss of American lives, with no possibility of any success-of the en\u00ad cia ve theory. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield at that point? Mr. SYMINGTON. I shall be happy to yield to the Senator in a moment, but the Senator from Arkansas has the floor. If we are anxious to achieve \u00b7success at minimum cost in money and lives, why favor the ground war, as exempli\u00ad fied by the enclave theory? Why is there so much effort on the part of many people, not to use the qualitative advan\u00ad tages we have in the air and on the sea? Why do we have unnecessary sacrifices in order to play their game, instead, if we should fight at all, working on a basis that is more advantageous to us? If the President decides to get out of Vietnam now, I am ready to get out. But I am not ready to agree to leave those young men, whom I have seen over there three times in the last 15 months, operate under rules and reg\u00ad ulations which would make it impossible ~~ \"'\"\"'-for them, as I see it, to achieve any success. There has never been anything in his\u00ad tory that will justify the concept of bringing the North Vietnamese to the conference table through a display of weakness as against a display of strength. Let me emphasize again that I am not talking about any bombing of civilians, only military targets. I just do not understand why some people wish to see us continue to fight on the ground over there, and not use our qualitative advantages. I have asked this of the Senator. I say this with great respect and in no sense of criticism. Mr. FULBRIGHT. Ever since General Gavin first came before the committee I have been greatly concerned about the psychology of this war. In correspond\u00ad ence with me, General Ridgway en\u00ad dorsed General Gavin's position. The Senator from Missouri says it in\u00ad volves success. It involves the question of what is necessary. This particular point, I think, involves a judgment of human nature. The Senator has had much experience with that in connection with his own constituents or he would not be elected. Every Member of this body must have some feeling about the reac\u00ad tions and attitudes of his constituents. I think there is some difference between the views of the Senator from Missouri and myself about the people in Vietnam. This is why it is not inappropriate to discuss the origin of the war. Mr. SYMINGTON. Does the Senator mean North Vietnam or South Vietnam? Mr. FULBRIGHT. Both. It involves people who are opposed to us, whether they are in North or South Vietnam. It is not inappropriate or irrelevant to con\u00ad sider how the war started or how the peo\u00ad ple feel about it. Many people say that that has nothing to do with it. It does have something to do with it in connec\u00ad tion with making a correct judgment about the attitudes of the people who are fighting. Bernard Fall and Jean Lacoutre, who have been engaged in long study of Viet\u00ad nam, have different views from the ad\u00ad ministration about what is likely to make North Vietnam come to the conference table. Are they likely to do so under the pressure we exert? They may be in\u00ad clined to, although, coming from the Ozark hills as I do, and seeing how some of those mountain people resent being pushed around, I am inclined to doubt whether they would. When I first ran for the Senate one of the most nervous men in one county was a banker. He had many trucks on the road. He did not want the Governor, my opponent, on his back. He liked me, but he could not support me. But across the street was a poor fellow who was not concerned about the Governor be\u00ad cause he did not have anything to lose. He did not mind letting people know where he stood. My point is that I am not at all sure that the United States scares those poor little people in Viet\u00ad nam as we think we are scaring them. They 'do not have much to lose like rich people or rich nations do. I wish they would give up. We have the power to kill them wholesale, but I cer-tainly would not like to do it because I think that approach misjudges the psy\u00ad chology of these people. I am not at all sure that the so-called Rostow theory of surgical bombing is sound psychologically. It would be much more sound if it were applied to Paris, for example. Paris is a great city. Threatened with disaster, the govern\u00ad ment there might consider giving up in order to save Paris. But what do the people of North Vietnam have to lose? This is an integral part of the judgment as to what is likely to succeed in this war. First, our national interests are not in any way so substantially involved-! think the Senator from Georgia con\u00ad firmed that in his original reaction to our first sending in 200 people. The Senator from Georgia did not ob\u00ad ject at that time. He did not think our national interest was involved in Viet\u00ad nam. He did not want any part of it. But now he finds himself inextricably involved in a tragedy, and he thinks that the best way to bring the war to a close is 'to continue increasing the military pressure. We must think of our national inter\u00ad ests and our commitments in other parts of the _world, particularly in Euroi:>e, where, as one of the leading authorities said yesterday, \"You know, the big league is still Europe, not Asia.\" We must make a choice and use our best judgment to determine what the other side is like, and how they view the war. And it does make a difference how they view it. Rightly or wrongly, I do not think they believe they are the ag\u00ad gressor and that they have sought to invade that country without provocation. Mr. SYMINGTON. The Senator does not associate the matter of bombing mil\u00ad itary airfields, on which there are planes preparing to fight against American pilots, with attacking Paris? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I only use\u00b7 that as an illustration to show the difference between the reactions of poor people, who have nothing to lose--their deter\u00ad mination and their independence of of\u00ad ficial threats--and rich people do not have that degree of freedom. The Senator knows very well that rich people are the nervous ones. If one has a lot to lose, he tends to be nervous. That is a well-known characteristic. A rich person is a nervous man be\u00ad cause he has a lot to lose. That is only natural. If I were rich, I would be the same way, but coming from the Ozarks, I do not have a lot to lose. Mr. SYMINGTON. Perhaps the posi\u00ad tion of the Senator and myself on some of these points are closer than he thinks. The difference is, if we are to stay there, the Senator wants to stay on a different basis than I would. I would stay on the basis of maximum accomplishment with minimum expenditures and, more im\u00ad portant, minimum casualties. Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator has mentioned Korea. I do not like that settlement because we still have 55,000 men there. However, that situation, bad as it is, is better than the war we are waging in Vietnam. We have to keep many men there and it costs a lot of money. We have spent a great deal of February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4725 money in Korea, and I used to complain about it during consideration of the for\u00ad eign-aid bill. However, that was pea\u00ad nuts compared with the bill for the Viet\u00ad nam war. What I am trying to do is to develop the idea that the administration could possibly be wrong in their calculations of the ultimate wisdom of the policy they are following. I know it is their decision to make. All I can do is give them the best judgment that I have, based upon our hearings, what I have read and heard, and my dis\u00ad cussions with knowledgeable people who know a great deal more about this situ\u00ad ation than I do. Mr. Fall, who was tragically killed in Vietnam the other day, knew much about the history and background of these peo\u00ad ple. He had specialized in that field for 15 years. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I will yield in a moment, but I am about ready to yield the floor. Mr. CLARK. I do not intend to ask for the floor. I would appreciate it if the Senator would keep the floor very briefly. I should like to make the point that my friend, the Senator from Mis\u00ad souri, I am sure quite inadvertently, has misrepresented my position about the bombing, and I know he did not mean to do so. Mr. SYMINGTON. I did not mean to misrepresent anything, and would be very glad to be clarified if I have made a mistake. Mr. CLARK. I appreciate the point of view of the Senator. My position has been and is that I would stop the bombing for the third time in order to explore the clear sig\u00ad nals, and I think they are clear signals, which have come in the last several months from North Vietnam, to the ef\u00ad fect that if we stop our bombing, they would be willing to talk. -I would take the calculated risk of stopping the bomb\u00ad ings. However, I must say that I get a little tired of having my position repre\u00ad sented as though I wanted to subject American boys in South Vietnam to an extra hazard. The moment that Ho Chi Minh started to step up the rate of ip.:filtratiop., I would resume the bombing. I would certainly use the bombing to defend the enclaves and close support. If the North Viet\u00ad namese air force were foolish enough to come down. with offensive measures against the South Vietnamese, I would take out their airfields. Therefore, I think that what is being done is to erect a sort of strawman with respect to the position which it is alleged that those of us who would like to stop the aggressive action and move on the defensive are advocating. All we are saying is that we want to de\u00ad fend our boys in South Vietnam with everything we have got. We want to get to the negotiating table as soon as we can. We think that the search and destroy policy is unduly costly of American life. We think that the pacification program 1s not working and will not work. We do believe there is an excellent chance if we stop the bombing in North Vietnam that we will :find ourselves with\u00ad in the reasonably near future with an armistice and negotiations. If that position turns out to be wrong, I would still take a defensive position, but I would resume the bombing of North Vietnam for the purpose of preventing that very infiltration from the north which gives the Senator from Missouri so much concern. I make the point made by the great hawk, Joseph Alsop, a short time ago\u00ad it was made at the hearings which I guess were executive, but it has been made abundantly clear and it comes from a number of sources-that North Vietnam can send just as many men and supplies in support of the Vietcong right now under bombing as they want to. It is a good deal more expensive than if we were not bombing, but they can send as many of Ho Chi Minh's boys down to kill American boys as they want, regardless of the bombing. Mr. SYMINGTON. Does the Sena\u00ad tor believe that? He has quoted a news\u00ad paperman. Does the Senator believe it is true that if we attack such mili\u00ad tary targets, military airfields, and knock out military aircraft and power stations and petroleum dumps, they can still send just as many North Vietnamese down as they desire? Mr. CLARK. That is correct. Mr. SYMINGTON. That is an indict\u00ad ment of the military effort of the United States, and I do not believe it. Mr. CLARK. Who has the floor? Mr. FULBRIGHT. I have the fioor. I yielded to the Senator for a colloquy. I will yield to the other Senator also. Mr. SYMINGTON. I will be glad to listen. Mr. CLARK. I conclude very briefiy by saying that I do not think the bomb\u00ad ing is stopping the infiltration of the south by the north, and I believe that I have put that in the RECORD already from the hearings on the bill. I know that I have been told in executive session, in a situation which I cannot repeat here, that what I say is trtJe. They can send as many people down as they wish. It will cost them a little more. I am happy to yield, and I thank the Senator for yielding to me. Mr. FULBRIGHT. This is Secretary McNamara's st~tement about this sub\u00ad ject. I quote from page 73 of the hear\u00ad ing on the supplemental military pro\u00ad curement bill. But I never belleved in the past, and I don't believe today, that air bombardment on any acceptable scale will stop or signifi\u00ad cantly reduce the movement of such small numbers of men and such small quantities of material as are being sent from the north to the south. Mr. SYMINGTON. I was present when the Secretary made that statement. Mr. FULBRIGHT. It is good au\u00ad thority. Mr. SYMINGTON. I would also make a point this afternoon that has to do with the testimony of General Gavin. No one has greater respect for Gen\u00ad eral Gavin than I, having known him for many years. He was an outstanding Army officer. At the time of Dienbienphu, when others of the military were on one side of that picture and he and General Ridgway on the other, I fully supported his position. I believe, however, that there is a marked difference between the position of today and the position at the time of Dienbienphu. All people occasionally make mistakes. There was a time when over 90 percent of the Army budget was for missiles a,t a time when our troops .in Berlin were carrying 20-pound radios, with children in the streets of Little Rock and St. Louis with a better radio that weighed 3 pounds. The atomic cannon also comes to mind. I am sure all Senators will agree that did not prove to be one of the best weap\u00ad ons of the time. I was in Vietnam during the last bomb\u00ad ing pause, over a year ago. Wha\u00b7t did it get our forces? As to whether we should have another bombing pause, that is a matter of opinion. The President of the United States is in a right good position to know these matters. He says that at this time there is no light leading to negotiation; there\u00ad fore he does not wish to stop the bomb\u00ad ing. For some reason, when Senators-in\u00ad cluding some who have a basic apprehen\u00ad sion about all military men-find a mili\u00ad tary man who conforms to their think\u00ad ing, all of a sudden he leaves the military pack and becomes a prophet overnight. General Gavin completely disagrees with the theory just expressed by the Senator from Pennsylvania, because he said at the recent hearing that we should not have any more bombing of North Vietnam regardless, under no conditions. He would stop it and keep it stopped, no matter what, and then protect a few ground forts like Cam Ranh Bay. I believe that is the type and charac\u00ad ter of defeatism which is dangerous to the security of the United States as ap\u00ad parently he believes the thinking of all the current Joint Chiefs of Staff and the distinguished senior Senator from Geor\u00ad gia is detrimental to that security. Those men out there represent us. They are doing their best, :fighting; many are dying, many more are being wounded. I say give them all qualitative advantages possible to in turn give them the best chance. I have no more respect for General Gavin, who is in private business and has been out of the Pentagon for over 10 years, than I have for the present Joint Chiefs of Staff. Nor do i have any more respect for his opinion as I have for the opinions of the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Georgia, who lis\u00ad ten day after day, to these problems. Mr. FULBRIGHT. I have to take 1issue with the way the Senator has char\u00ad acterized what I believe to be General Gavin's intention in his statement. I believe that the Senator has overstated it. . I have the greatest respect for the judgment of General Gavin, and the fact that he has had civilian experience and experience as an ambassador adds to his credibility. He has had a successful mili\u00ad tary role, a second role as a high rank\u00ad ing diplomat, and now he has experience 4726 C0NGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 in private industry. He is a young man, relatively speaking, an extremely intel\u00ad ligent man, with this rather unique back\u00ad ground of having three careers. As to my choosing him to rely on as a military authority, I wiU have to say that the Senator does the same thing with political people. He approves of some and \u00b7he disapproves of others. There is nothing peculiar about that. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his patience in answering these questions. I hope that the discussion has shed some light as to our respective positions. The Senator has been most patient and fair in his responses, as he always is, and I appreciate his taking the time to respond. Mr. RUSSELL. I thank the Senator. I am always happy to discuss any matter with the Senator from Arkansas. He is always fair in his statements. Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, the following occurred during the course of the hearings when General Gavin ap\u00ad peared before the Committee on Foreign Relations: Senator COOPER. Now, the Administration said that it is willlng to, we understand, to stop the bombing of North Vietnam if there could be some sign-! think the President said almost any sign. So you will know I am not in opposition to this idea, I may say that I have said last year when the bombing pause was brought to a close, I thought the pause should be continued, and I think it should have been this year. General GAVIN. Yes, sir. Senator CooPER. But in what respect then do you differ from the statement of the Ad\u00ad ministration that it would halt the bombing if it could find some sign of reciprocity on the part of North Vietnam at present, \u00b7almost any sign? General GAVIN. Senator Cooper, I do not think we should be bombing North Vietnam. In this respect I differ. We should not be bombing North Vietnam regardless. General Gavin was never much of a friend of the Air Force. That is his right. But I think his present position is but further denigration of airpower, naval airpower as well as Air Force airpower; and I believe such denigration is not in the best interest of the United States. This position of the General is stronger than the position the Senator from Ar\u00ad kansas has taken with respect to the bombing of North Vietnam, and\u00b7 stronger than the position taken by the Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. RUSSELL. The amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania is differ\u00ad ent from the explanation he has made, because the amendment says that none of the funds authorized by this act or any other act should be used to carry out military operations in or over North Vietnam. Mr. CLARK. That is correct. Mr. RUSSELL. Th\u00b7at means our forces absolutely cannot drop one bomb on North Vietnam, under any circum\u00ad stances. Mr. CLARK. The Senator has stopped short of the period at the end of the sentence-unless there is a declaration of war. ,. Mr. RUSSELL. Yes, unless there is a declaration of war. \"' Mr. CLARK. And if, after we stop the bombing, the Ho C.J;li \u00a5inh ~army comes down in massive force to the south, then I would vote for a declaration. Mr. RUSSELL. There is nothing in the amendment about the forces coming down. Mr. CLARK. All the amendment says is that we are now in a situation where, in my judgment, if we are going to con\u00ad tinue to1 escalate this war, we ought to have a declaration of war. I would stop the bombing, to see if we can get to the negotiating table. If that fails, and we find Ho Chi Minh's divisions coming down the trail and reenforcing the Viet\u00ad cong to a massive extent, I would vote for a declaration of war; but I would still think we ought to have a declara\u00ad tion of war. I point out to the Senator that the best figures the Department of Defense has given us is that there are presently 275,- 000 men in combat against us in South Vietnam, and 230,000 of those men are Vietcong, and only 45,000 are North Viet\u00ad namese regulars, and, in effect, the Viet\u00ad cong are estimated to have only 10,000 Communists among their 230,000 troops. Other than the one for the number of Communists, these are figures which have been obtained from the Defense Department. I did not dream them up. Mr. RUSSELL. If that is so, I had not understood that. I understood that only 46,000 organized North Vietnamese in units had been moved into the south, but that there were hard cadres there that had been engaged in training the Vietcong for a long time. This busi\u00ad ness of north and south is very difficult to follow, because it is more a matter of the philosophy of the individual than where he lives. You have men from the south in the north, and men from the north were in the south even before this fighting broke out. The Senator will recall that immedi\u00ad ately after the Geneva accords were signed, we furnished a great deal of transportation to enable a large number of people who lived in the north to move to the south. A very large proportion of the Catho\u00ad lic population of the north did move south, and we transported them. We sent out a large number of LST's to move them down. I want to refer further to the fact that the bombing is not a consonant thing. Secretary McNamara has never been very enthusiastic about the bombing. I think that he feels about it almost as the Senator from Arkansas does. Gen\u00ad eral Wheeler, who has been to Vietnam often and is in close contact with the men, testified on page 137.of the hearings that the bombings had probably notre\u00ad duced the infiltration of manpower, but had reduced supplies to the point where the North Vietnamese cannot take care of any additional manpower in the south. General Wheeler is quoted as saying: I do believe, as I said yesterday, that our bombing in North Vietnam and against the infiltration routes [deletedl has reduced the level of materiel supplies which are moved from North Vietnam into South Vietnam. I cannot give you any figures on this. I also have the feeling that the reason we don't have the [deleted] combat battalions in South Vietnam that were anticipated [deleted] last year, the reason that we don't see a larger buildup of North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam, is a measure of the effectiveness of our bombing campaign to date. \u00b7 He testified to that effect two or three times in the hearings. I agree that the Secretary of Defense was less convinced of the value of the bombings. I believe in full and free debate and I want every Member of the Senate, whatever his views, to express them, and I shall defend to the death his right to express them on the ft.oor of the Senate. But I believe that when amendments are urged here that would have the effect of absolutely terminating any bombing in the north, that this, in itself, will stir the dying embers of hope in the breasts of Ho Chi Minh and his associates. Every time they hear that leading Members of this body are supporting proposals that would forbid the use of the air arm against North Vietnam, and I think the air attacks hurt them as badly as any\u00ad thing does, that postpones the date of the settlement. Mr. FULBRIGHT. One of the things that it is hard for us to accept in this case is the great disparity between Viet\u00ad nam and the United States. Most of our wars-! \u00b7should not say most of our wars because the Spanish-American War, and particularly the action in the Philippines, was most one sided when it pitted the great United States against a few natives led by Aguinaldo-but at least in World War I and World War II the United States was fighting powers comparable to itself. This causes to arise in our consciences certain views about our national honor, and what we could do, and so forth. I never felt that in fighting this war the honor of this country was involved. I felt we got into it more or less casually by mistake and that we \u00b7should say, not necessarily in these words, that we made a mistake and \"let us settle this matter.\" We do not want to wipe off the face of the earth a small, weak, underdeveloped country. That is an element in this situation which would not be the case were we fighting countries comparable to our own, such as Russia or China. It always embarrasses me a bit to feel that the _United States, the greatest power in the. wprld, with all of its eco\u00ad nomic wealth, its intelligent, skilled people, its great technology-all of that pitted against this poor little country of peasants who were not really threaten\u00ad ing anybody, least of all the United States. It bothers me to realize what the United States is doing to these very backward, poor people who never thought of coming over to bother us. The argument that we must fight them there or we will have to fight them in San Francisco is utter nonsense. The administration says that we are not go\u00ad ing to fight China. This is the am\u00ad biguous situation that confuses people. On the one hand, the Secretary of State leads us to believe that this war is justi\u00ad fied to contain China. On the other hand, statements are made---like those made here today-that we would do al- . February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4727 most anything to keep China from be\u00ad coming involved. We do not think they will intervene. The Senator from Missouri said that all of these military experts have said that they do not think that China will come in. Then we are not containing China. This is an example of the confusion that this war causes. But the Senator from Arkansas-being a simple Ozark hillbilly-would like to see this war stopped on an honorable basis. It might require at least tacit admission that we could have made some wrong d~;;cisions over the past 15 or 2{) years, along the lines that the Senator from Georgia mentioned. When we put 200 U.S. sol\u00ad diers there in 1955, for example. He is not adverse to saying we made a mistake. By implication he was mistaken just as I made a mistake in not examining more closely some of the steps taken in the past. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent to have printed in the RECORD an article by Chalmers M. Roberts, in which he said in part: AB to the guerrillas, Ky said that the num\u00ad ber of dedicated Communists who form the leadership of these forces numbers no more than 10,000. Some American officials have put that figure at about 8,000 or 9,000. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: KY SAYS \"Too SOON\" To STOP BOMBING; SAIGON OPPOSES EARLY NEGOTIATIONS (By Chalmers M. Roberts) SAIGON, Feb. 3.-There are diverging views on the current talk about peace negotiations between the government here and that' in Washington. Today Premier Nguyen Oao Ky publicly paralleled President Johnson's press confer\u00ad ence remarks, although he had not then seen them, only to the extent of calling for \"some concrete suggestions\" from Hanoi rather than just hints that talks \"could\" take place if the United States stopped bombing North Vietnam. But there was nothing similar in what Ky said to Mr. Johnson's Thursday plea for \"just almost any step\" by Hanoi as a reason for halting the bombing. Furthermore, it is now known that the Saigon government believes it is too soon for negotiations because it feels the next six months wm vastly improve its own and the Allied position here and thus provide a far better bargaining position in what it con\u00ad siders will be extremely tough discussions with the Communists. TALKS TO NEWSMEN Ky made his remarks at a breakfast with a dozen newsmen in his modest Tansonnhut Airport home. He added that he feels \"it is too soon to stop the bombing.\" He again spoke with reporters after helicoptering to the Mekong Delta just outside Cantho where he attended the solemn opening of a war cemetery by the Hoa Hao ~ect. Ky said that \"if their ('Hanoi's) proposi\u00ad tion is concrete, reasonable and provides South Vietnam with full independence and integrity I see no objections. Don't let them have a chance to destroy all the good things we have done in the past ten years.\" The Premier added that the Communists \"are more afraid of a civilian elected govern\u00ad ment here than of the m111tary because it means a regime which is stable and stronger.\" These last remarks are key to his thinking, obserVers said. \u00b7 He told newsmen that he now thfnks that the election of\u00b7a President can take place as early as the end of July with the legislative election in August or September. Earlier it had been assumed the presidential voting would not come before September. It is the time to get a civllian government elected that Ky is now playing for and that means no halt in the m111tary pressure, in\u00ad cluding bombing of the North, before that milestone is passed, according to observers. CLEAN ELECTIONS Ky added that \"we must have very clean and honest elections to give the Presidency real prestige\" and he added that he \u00b7would invite 1000 newsmen to come and observe the voting. About 600 were here for last September's election of the Constituent As\u00ad sembly which is now drafting the constitu\u00ad tion which creates the Presidency. Ky was publicly silent on his own plans but few here doubt he is a highly likely presi\u00ad dential candidate. He was optimistic in his assessment of the war. As to the guerrlllas, Ky said that the number of dedicated Communists who form the leadership of these forces numbers no more than 10,000. Some American officials have put that figure at about 8000 or 9000. Ky said that the Communists will have \"to stop their aggression, stop infiltration, stop everything so the South and the North can live in peace for the next 20 or 25 years.\" TOUGH TALKS The Saigon government's belief that tough negotiations lie ahead, when they do take place, includes a clear realization that the Communists may very well try for a coalition regime in South Vietnam, observers said. \u00b7This will be stoutly resisted, the informed observers said, except that it is not beyond possib111ty that a former member or two of the National Liberation Front, the political arm of the Vietcong, could become cabinet members. But this could only occur, they added, if Saigon was certain he was either truly repentant or had been an NLF member simply because of Nationalist feelings. It is realized that to accept such a possi\u00ad b111ty could be a means of helping the Com\u00ad munists save face on a settlement. But this all depends, it is felt, on the strength of a new civilian government and the state of the war. As to latter, Ky said today that he felt two American divisions should be sent into the Delta. So far a U.S. brigade of 4000 to 5000 men has been committed to the IV Corps area there, not all yet in place. Hence Saigon iS' in no rush, as it some\u00ad times thinks President Johnson seems to be, to get to the negotiating table. Mr. COOPER and Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MoNDALE in the chair). The Senator from Kentucky is recognized. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, as I .came into the Chamber I heard my friend, the distinguished Senator from Missouri [Mr. SYMINGTON], allude to a question I had asked General Gavin. when he testified before the Committee on Foreign Relations, and General Gav\u00ad in's response. As it also stated my po\u00ad sition, I should like to elaborate on it for a moment. When the Tonkin Bay resolution came before the Senate in August 1964, it was managed by the Senator from Ar\u00ad kansas [Mr. FuLBRIGHT]. In speaking on the resolution-a resolution for which I voted-! asked certain questions which went to the point of whether, under the resolution which was being considered by the Senate, and later supported by the Senate with the exception of two votes, we were giving approval, in advance, to the President of the United States to take action, not only to resist any at\u00ad tack made upon the forces of the United States--which he would have the au\u00ad thority to take no matter what the Con\u00ad gress did-but whether we were also ap\u00ad proving, in advance, action against North Vietnam, including the bombing of North Vietnam. In the debate, I stated that I thought section II of the resolution did provide to the President of the United States some character of approval in advance to action, even bombing of North Viet\u00ad nam. As I remember the answers of the dis\u00ad tinguished Senator from Arkansas, he agreed in effect with my statement. I then stated that because I was concerned about the implication of section II, I thought it was very necessary that the President take immedate steps toward negotiations to end the war, or refer it to the Geneva Convention or to the United Nations. Since then, I visited Vietnam a year and 1 month ago, at the time of the bombing pause. When I returned, I talked to the President of the United States and stated that, in my view, the bombing pause should be continued to see whether there would be any re\u00ad sponse to the President's worldwide ap\u00ad peal for negotiation and peace. That did not occur. Then, with the recent bombing pause, I again stated tha\u00b7t I thought it would be wise to continue the pause, to see whether any response could be made to the President's efforts, and to determine if there was a possibility of negotiations, as was suggested from many quarters. I should like to say now that consider\u00ad ing the great losses both to our men and to our resources-but particularly to our men if the war is continued for a long time-that I would prefer to risk another bombing cessation to determine if there is any willingness on the part of North Vietnam to negotiate. I cannot state the length of such a cessation because I do not believe that a government could ever say that it would not and could not take steps to defend its troops if neces\u00ad sary. But I would support another bombing pause to see whether there was any possibility of negotiations. These are the views I have held, but in addressing myself to the amendment, I do not believe that it would have any effective value, other than expressing the views of those who favor it . I make my statement for these rea\u00ad sons: Whatever our views may be, a war is in process and the President of the United States is acting as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The Con\u00ad gress could cut off all funds to support our troops and effectively remove the power of the Commander in Chief to carry on the war-but the Congress will not do this, and I could not vote to with\u00ad draw support from those who :fight there. I do not believe that Congress can con\u00ad stitutionally limit the authority of the Commander in Chief to take such steps as he believes to be necessary in the dis\u00ad charge of his duties as Commander in Chief as this amendment proposes. I do not believe that the amendment has any 4728 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 value except to state the opinions of Members of the Senate who support it. I do not believe the Congress could direct and command our forces. As I understand it, the President of the United States is trying to find an avenue for ne\u00ad gotiations. We can give our views, our advice, marshal _opinion, and my opinion is that although we disagree with the President, it is his function and his heavY responsibility to choose the best ways to enter negotiations. For the reas\u00b7ons I have stated, I cannot support the amendment. Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the supplemental military procurement and construction authorization bill for fiscal year 1967. This bill provides additional authoriza\u00ad tion for defense appropriations which are absolutely necessary if we are to back up our boys fighting in Vietnam. I want to congratulate the able chair\u00ad man of the Armed Services Committee, the distinguished senior Senator from Georgia [Mr. RussELL], and the other members of the committee for the care\u00ad ful work they have done in analyzing this measure. I think it should be pointed out that this bill covers only a part of the fund\u00ad ing authority which the Department of Defense is currently seeking. It is not concerned with personnel, operations, or maintenance of the armed services' op\u00ad erations in the Far East. It is primarily a ba.ckup bill to support the sacrifice our men are making in the combat zone. It seeks to provide a continuous supply of th~ aircraft and missiles which our forces need for their daily missions. It seeks to provide the research, develop\u00ad ment, testing, and evalution which our forces need to meet the special prob\u00ad lems of combat and terrain which are encountered in a guerrilla-type war. It authorizes construction moneys for crash building programs necessary to supply support activity for Southeast Asia. \u00b7 , Thus, it will be seen that this par\u00ad ticular bill is not authorizing any esca\u00ad lation or broadening of the war in Viet\u00ad nam. It is simply backing up the GI's in Southeast Asia who are risking their lives fighting to preserve our freedom. Our country has put these men out there. We have a moral obligation to provide them with the equipment and facilities they need to do the job they arC;} ~oing. Unfortunately, some of the distin\u00ad guished members of this body have chos\u00ad en to treat this legislation as though it were a new policy declaration. They are using this occasion to ventilate at length their familiar objections against the Vietnam war or the manner in which we are fighting it. They have chosen to transform routine consideration of nec\u00ad essary military support legislation into an excuse for a full-scale debate on the propriety of national policy in Vietnam. This is not a time to discuss policy. The time to discuss policy was during the debate on the Bay of Tonkin resolution. I respect the disagreements of certain of my colleagues in this body, but this is not the moment to pursue a negative course. Every hour spent in debate here is holding up the procurement of equip\u00ad ment that our men in the field current-ly need. Every hour spent here means a delay in the support activity which our men need now, for the actions in which they are currently engaged. Policy ques\u00ad tions should be discussed at leisure, with reasoned analysis; they should not be discussed in the heat of urgent need. Nevertheless, since some Senators have chosen to question our 'current policy, it may be appropr-iate to review the situa\u00ad tion in Vietnam, which presently calls for such urgent support. Just as some critics have occasioned the delay of this appropriations bill by questioning policy at an inappropriate \u00b7 time, so too, some of our policies themselves have delayed the swift and suc\u00b7cessful conclusion of the war. It is not my PUrPose here either to question or defend the decisions which led to the U.S. commitment in Vietnam. Since the United States is there, how\u00ad ever, it is my view as a Senator con\u00ad cerned with Armed Forces preparedness to see that we should take every step possible to bring the war to a successful conclusion as quickly as possible. A suc\u00ad cessful conclusion may mean either an all-out victory on the battlefield, which calls for an unconditional surrender of the insurgent forces in the South-or an honorable, negotiated peace settlement, based upon the cessation of guerrilla warfare by the Vietcong and their sup\u00ad porters from the North, which guaran\u00ad tees the security and the sovereignty of the people of South Vietnam from for\u00ad eign domination or from domination by a foreign ideology forced upon them .. In my opinion, victory is necessary to insure permanent peace. It is true that we are fighting a lim\u00ad ited war in Vietnam. It is limited in the sense that we are not seeking any ter\u00ad ritorial aggrandizement for the United States, and in the sense that we are not attempting to impose our way of life or our system of government upon any\u00ad one in that area of the world. There should be no limitations placed, however, on our total commitment to the cause of freedom in \u00b7Southeast Asia to the ex\u00ad tent that our basic reason for being there or our will to persevere on freedom's be\u00ad half is open to question or limitations. It would be a mistake to allow self-im\u00ad posed limitations to so hedge our com~ mitment to the cause of freedom for the people of South Vietnam, that we accept the terms of warfare laid down by our enemy and allow ourselves to become bogged down in a land war of attrition. Many years ago, Gen. Douglas Mac\u00ad Arthur, whose knowledge of this area of the world and of the rules of warfare is \u00b7not open to question, warned against U.S. involvement in a major land war in Asia. This advice is as well taken today as it was then. That is why the United States must take full advantage of its sea and air superiority and wage this war on terms most favorable to us, and not allow the Communist aggressors to coax us into playing by the ground rules established by them. Nothing would be more acceptable to the Communist forces in Southeast Asia than for the United States and its allies to rely solely upon its ground forces in the conduct of the war in Vietnam. The Communists are prepared to carry on a virtually endless guerrilla-type action, which has its slack seasons and its hot seasons, but which they feel would spell eventual success for their cause. The Vietcong and their mentors in Hanoi are convinced that they won the war against the French in Paris, rather than in Vietnam, and they are further convinced that reliance upon the same tactics now would mean even\u00ad tual victory in Washington. There are certain steps which the United States can, and I feel must, take in the prosecution of the war. First, we must bomb all the strategic and military targets which exist through\u00ad out North Vietnam. It is true that, prior to the truce, we were bombing in North Vietnam virtually every day; and it is true that in recent days we have initiated shelling and mining operations on a minor basis. Nevertheless, the use of airpower above the DMZ--demilitarized zone-is of little consequence if it is not calculated to eliminate the warmaking potential in the north. The question is not one of merely increasing either the scale or the frequency of the bombing attaclks. Rather, it is one of making a more selective choice of targets and con\u00ad centrating the attacks where they are calculated to do the most damage to our foes. I honestly do not know whether this could be called escalation or not, since it could be done with little or no increase in the intensity of the air raids. It is unjustifiable to me, and to the men directly involved, that we can ask them to risk their lives to damage one span of a relatively innocuous bridge, while more important targets are left un\u00ad touched, and many times untouchable. Our bombings should be aimed\u00b7 at all ob\u00ad vious military targets such as airfields, troop concentrations, and military con\u00ad voys, as . well as certain basic industries which are essential to a war effort. These would. include petroleum storage dumps, steel mills, cement factories, and power-genevating faciliti:es, among oth\u00ad ers. The second essential step which I feel should be taken is to close all the ports in North Vietnam. The most notorious of these is, of course, Haiphong. By all means, this port should be closed. How\u00ad ever, there are others through which sup\u00ad plies and military materiel are re\u00b7ceived which should be closed as well. There are three ways in which the ports oan be closed: bombing, emeargo\u00ad ing, or mining. The weight of military opinion leans toward mining the ports as the most efficient and quickest method available. We have just begun mining the rivers in the north, but this operation is aimed principally at light native river traftlc. It will not have any effect upon the major souvces of SUPPlY reaching: the country. It only affects .the distribution of the mater.ial, once it has arrived. Accord\u00ad ing to recent figures published 1n the press, the Soviets are sending 80,000 tons of goods a month to North Vietnam. Some 80 .percent of this comes in by ship. It is repor.ted that an average of one Soviet ship a day docks at Haiphong. ln one recent month alone, the Soviets sent 25,000 metric tons of gasoline and oil through Haiphong. Moscow and February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4729 Hanoi should be put on notice that the ports are to be mined, and that further supply ships enter the harbors at their own risk. These two steps--more selective bomb\u00ad ing and closing the ports of North Viet\u00ad nam-would, in my judugment, hasten the conclusion of the war in Vietnam. Some military people feel that at its pres\u00ad ent rate of prosecution, the war could last as long as 10 years. Such a pro\u00ad tracted confiict is not necessary if the full impact of the war is brought home to Hanoi. The enemy must be taught that when waging a war like this--a so-called war of national liberation-they are go\u00ad ing to be punished. Then, and only then, will there be any incentive for them to sue for peace or abandon their attempts at conquest. The United States has unquestionably shown the enemy, if it ever needed to, that we have the power to win the war in Vietnam; and yet, the enemy persists. Obviously the enemy is not convinced that the United States has the will to use that power in the manner necessary to bring the war to a successful conclu\u00ad sion. We must convince them that not only do we possess the requisite power, but that we also possess the necessary will. A display of the will is as necessary as a display of the power. That is why it is important that this supplemental appropriations bill be passed without further delay. This bill simply supports policies which have already been initiated. Much as I would like to see even more positive efforts made to bring us to victory in Vietnam, it is far more crucial that we avoid hesi\u00ad tation in providing the back-up support necessary for our present level of opera\u00ad tions. I trust that the Members of this body will respond to the commitment this Nation has already undertaken, and promptly pass this legislation. Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I have agreed to make a statement tonight, prior to the offer of the amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. CLARK] later this evening. After listening to this debate today, I should say that if the Clark-Morse amendment had accomplished no other purpose than to produce the dialog of the day, it would have been very much worthwhile. But the amendment has a much greater pun)ose. This amend\u00ad ment is being offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Ore\u00ad gon for pasage, not merely for the edu\u00ad cation of Senators. Perhaps it will not pass, because I do not think we have reached that stage yet, in the dialog on the pros and the cons of the war in Vietnam, where a majority of Senators are yet ready to face up to the realities of both the war itself and the effect that it will have on the future of American history. I think it will take some time longer before the elective representatives of this free people in Congress will face up to the fact that we must necessarily com\u00ad pletely change our foreign policy in Asia. As I listened to the dialog this after\u00ad noon, I thought of the French Par\u00ad liame:11t, for there is a direct relationship between the debate here on the fioor of the Senate today and the debates which occurred in the French Parliament for a long time preceding the ultimate de\u00ad cision of the French Government to with\u00ad draw from Indochina. Those French debates contained statement after state\u00ad ment by French parliamentarians that France had made a great mistake in get\u00ad ting involved in that war. In fact, the beloved Senator from Georgia [Mr. Rus\u00ad SELL] might just as well have been a Member of the French Parliament prior to the French withdrawal from Vietnam, because statements were made by French parliamentarians almost identical to the statements made by the Senator from Georgia about this war. On many occasions, the Senator from Georgia has stated, both on and off the fioor of the Senate, that we made a mis\u00ad take in going into the war, and he was opposed to our going in. Then, of course, he falls back on the rationalization that we are in, that is an accomplished fact, and therefore, on the basis of what he says, I can reach no other conclusion than that he thinks we ought to stay in until we have a victory. What a price that victory will cost us. Mr. President, I say again tonight that I do not think we can just, all of a sud\u00ad den, pull out. I have come to the con\u00ad clusion-and this is the first time that I have stated it in the course of this de\u00ad bate-that I do not think we can justify staying in on the basis of our present policy. I think there is a policy that could justify our staying in, and I shall outline it, in broad outline, tonight. However, if the choice is to stay in on the basis of what I interpret to be\u00b7 the terms that the Senator from Georgia [Mr. RussELL] would h.ave us stay in, it would be a great disservice to American history. I do not think-and I say this mos\u00b7t respectfully-that there is full comprehension on the part of many in Congress of what is happening within the body politic of this Republic. Mem\u00ad bers of Congress today are pretty much in the same situation th.at Members of the French Parliament were when, at one stage of the development\" of the French policy, the French fiag, too, was vigorously waved on the fioor of its Par\u00ad liament. The only solution, said those Frenchmen, was victory. The only so\u00ad lution was the surrender of the enemy. We h.ave many in this Congress going on television and radio and before the people, following a similar course of what they consider to be patriotic ap\u00ad peal, urging support for the notion that the only solution is victory. Victory for what? We can have vic\u00ad tory in a military sense; but we shall never have victory in the sense of win\u00ad ning the minds of the people of the world to our cause. For the people of the world, in my judgment, by an over\u00ad whelming majority, know that our\u00b7 cause is not a noble cause; that our cause is not a justifiable cause; that our cause is not a cause consistent with international morality. Most of the people of the world know that the United States cause is a cause of military dictation in an area of the world in which we did not have the slightest right to intervene in the first place; and I have come to the con\u00ad clusion that we ought to face up to the realization that we do not have the right to stay in southeast Asia on our terms. There are terms, on the basis of which we have a justification to stay and should stay for some years to come; but it is not on terms of the military power of de\u00ad struction that we can exercise-and there are those who would have us exercise it\u00ad that will force a surrender by the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong. As I have said so many times, that is not going to produce peace. That is going to produce only a truce out of which no peace will ever come. I think we make a mistake if we think we are admired. I think we make a mis\u00ad take if we think that in the underde\u00ad veloped areas of the world the people of the United States are now looked up to as good Samaritans. To the contrary, we are a feared people because of the result of the shocking, immoral foreign policy that we have foisted upon a part of Asia. After we force the surrender, Asians by the millions are going to recog\u00ad nize that what we are doing here we w111 have the power to do elsewhere unless they stop us. If one reads any history, he cannot escape the conclusion that any nation that starts on a course of military de\u00ad termination in the settlement of disputes in which it is not even a party is a nation that in the due course of time will find the opinion of ~he world organized against it, and that it cannot success\u00ad fully challenge that opinion of the world over the course of many years. I listened with great interest to the comments of the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. CooPER]. I could not disagree with him more in his interpretation of consti\u00ad tutionalism in this country. Why, of course, Congress has the power to stop the President. We have it, unless we just waive all of our check\u00ad ing power under the Constitution, and we have been waiving so much of it now for so many years that a Senator from\u00b7 Kentucky can stand on the fioor of the Senate and say, as he said a few minutes ago, that in his opinion under the Consti\u00ad tution we could not stop the President of the United States from following his course of action even if we wanted to. He qualified it ,slightly by saying that unless we denied him an of the funds we could not do so. May I say to the Senator from Ken\u00ad tucky, that if it is necessary in order to correct the historic mistakes that we have made in involving the American people in this war. we had better start denying him the funds. We certainly have that constitutional right under the check of the purse strings. That is ex\u00ad actly what the Constitution was written to provide-that armies could be raised by Congress only f9r 2 years at a time, and it is why the Constitution provides that funds may be withdrawn from the Treasury only in pursuit of appropriation made by law. This is where the check\u00ad ing is given to us. If we merely shrink from using it, that is not to say we do not possess it. The Clark-Morse amendment seeks to make a start toward the denying of some funds as a means of seeking to force a change of policy. 4730 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1f}6'l It reads: It is hereby declared to be the sense of the Congress- (1) that none of the funds authorized by this Act or any other Act should be used to carry out military operations in or over North Vietnam or to increase the number of United States m111tary personnel in South Vietnam above five hundred thousand, un\u00ad less there shall have been a declaration of war against North Vietnam by the Congress In accordance with article 1, section 8, of the Constitution of the United States; and (2) that the Congress support those efforts being made by men of good will throughout the world to prevent an expansion of the war in Vietnam and to bring that confiict to an end through a negotiated settlement which will preserve the honor of the United States, protect the vital interests of this country, and allow the people of South Vietnam to determine the affairs of that nation in their own way. I say to the Senator from Kentucky that the amendment is but an expres\u00ad sion of the sense of Congress. The amendment does not in itself deny the funds, but the amendment does state that it is the sense of the Congress that that is the course of action that should be followed unless the President of the United States changes his policy. Agreement to the amendment with that expression of opinion as the sense of the Congress provides time for the Presi\u00ad dent of the United States to decide whether he wants to follow the advice of the amendment. The Senator from ~entucky seems to overlook completely in his argument the fact that the amend\u00ad ment is in the form of advising the President of the United States under the advice and consent clause. I am sure the Senator from Kentucky would not argue that constitutionally, an undeclared warmaking places a limit in any way upon the right and the duty of Congress to advise the President of the United States. This amendment is an advisory amendment. If this President decides to ignore it, then Congress should take the next step of denying him the funds to prosecute the war at the level that he is prosecuting it. That is the purpose of the amendment, and I hope that Congress will agree to it now, although, as I said, I surmise that the amendment will not be agreed to and that we may be engaging only in an edu\u00ad cational process on foreign policy at this stage of the dialog. But, if the Members who think the contention being made here to the effect that those of us who will vote against the supplemental authorization bill are letting down the boys in South Vietnam is going to be convincing to a large body of Americans, then I want to say respect-' fully that my Colleagues could not be more wrong. There is growing in this country an attitude within American public opinion on a parallel with what happened in France when some of the parliamen\u00ad tarians in the French Parliament made the same speeches that were made on the fioor of the Senate this afternoon by those in opposition to the pending amendment, speeches in which the ap\u00ad peal was made to the French peopie that they could not let down their boys in Indochina, they were in the war, and they had to see it through. However, as the French people took an accounting of the blood loss, took note that they were losing more French offi.cers than were trained each year in the French military academy, and came to recognize that France, in fact, did not have any vital national interest in all of Indochina, they made it clear to their politicians: \"You either change French policy in Indochina, or we will change the government.\" There arose in France a great states\u00ad man-leader named Mendes France. He correctly read the facts concerning a divided France. He went before the French people on the pledge that if he were placed at the head of the French Government, he would proceed to take France out of the war. He was elected. Mendes France kept his pledge. I rec\u00ad ommend that policy to the present ad\u00ad ministration of this Government. Men\u00ad des France kept his pledge, and the Geneva Conference followed. As the result of the Geneva Conference, France got out of the war. Senators know that for 3 or more years I have invited attention repeatedly to the fact that the United States was opposed to the Geneva agreement. We were opposed to the treaty because Sec\u00ad retary of State Dulles had wanted to keep France in the war. That is why I have said that when this sorry, sad chapter of American history is written, John Foster Dulles will not come out of it an American hero, but will have to have placed upon his record much of the responsibility for the great mistake the United States has made in becoming involved on a unilateral basis in the bloodletting in Vietnam. There seems to be a great deal of agreement, even within Congress, and within the Senate on the evils of our initial involvement. I can give testi\u00ad mony to the number of Senators who have told me, no\u00b7t once, but many times, in the last 3% years, of the great mis\u00ad take it was for the United States to be\u00ad come involved. They share the point of view of the Senator from Georgia [Mr. RussELL]. But we have reached a point of view, at least in the cloak rooms and in increasing numbers of statements on the fioor of the Senate, that our historic record is not a: good one; but that hav\u00ad ing made a whole series of historic mis\u00ad takes, there is nothing that can be done about it now. We made them, and we are in a trap; we have got to see it through. I am always at a loss to understand what is meant by that argument that we have to see it through. See it through to what? I come to the general conclusion that what is meant is that we have to force a surrender; we have to kill and kill; we have to defoliate and defoliate; we have to burn and burn; we have to massacre, with our napalm bombing, increasing hundreds of inno\u00ad cent civilian victims-men, women, and children-in South Vietnam, and now in North Vietnam, as well, because it justi\u00ad fies total victory; it justifies our insist\u00ad ence on a surrender. Mr. President, it does not. When it is said, \"We are in, and there is not?ing we can do about it,\" my an\u00ad swer IS that there are many things we can do about it. The Clark-Morse amendment sets forth some implications as to what we would start doing about it. We could at least decide whether or not we want to make our warmaking legal. All the rationalizing and sophistry of those who justify this war on the ground that, the shooting having started, we do not need a declaration of war are not being bought by millions of A~ericans \u00b7 objection to it is growing at a rapid rat~ throughout this country. I have been on 22 university cam\u00ad puses since November 8, 1966, and I have not been on one at which young men have not come to me and expressed their feeling that the Government of the United States has no right to insist that they serve in the Armed Forces, in the absence of a declaration of war. They contend-and I argue with them\u00ad that they have a right to refuse to con\u00b7 form to the draft law. Last night, at Brown University in the open forum discussion that w~ con\u00ad ducted, one of the students stood up and asked a question and pressed this point. Later, in the reception period that fol\u00ad lowed, at a more informal discussion he was joined by other students who m'ade clear that they were seriously consider\u00ad ing defying the Government of the United States, in seeking to send them into a war without a declaration of war. I presented the point of view I always present: There cannot be any justifica\u00ad tion for defying the law and then expect\u00ad ing to be in any way exempted from the circumstances of its \u00b7enforcement. I do not like many phases of the draft law and that is why I voted against it th~ last two times, and undoubtedly will vote against it again, unless it is completely revised so that there can be a fair rather than a discriminatory piece of legisla\u00ad tion. I argued with these'students that their responsibility is to conform to the law and to seek to change the law, but not to advocate anarchy, or to disobey the law. When they say, \"This war violates our conscience,\" I reply that they do not meet the legal requirements giving them exemption because of conscientious ob\u00ad )ections pased upon religious grounds, and they have no right to expect that their violation of the law, will be con .. doned. I-believe that is a round legal argu\u00ad ment in reply to them; but it does not change the fact that this point of view exists, and it is increasing. It does not change the fact that increasing numbers of Americans, who no longer can be con\u00ad sidered an insignificant minority, are re\u00ad sentful of the President of the United States sending young men to their slaughter in South Vietnam, without his sending to this body a statement setting forth the reasons why he believes that we should make war, by way of a legal declaration of war under article I sec- tion 8. \u00b7 ' Mr. President, this war without a declaration of war is resulting in such an antipathy toward the President and this administration that as a Democratic Se~ator, once again I plead again with February 28;1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4731 my President to change this course of action. If he does not change it he is going to be confronted, and he should be confronted, with a nation so dis\u00ad united by November 6, 1968, that even if he wins the election he will not win a victory that will be worth having. Therefore, I have come to the conclu\u00ad sion that we should change our status drastically in South Vietnam. In chang\u00ad ing that status, we should make very clear to the nations of the world that unless there is a change of attitude on their part we will get out of Vietnam after the passage of a period of time, to which I shall allude in this statement. Mr. President, we cannot justify stay\u00ad ing in Vietnam indefinitely in order to effectuate the policy which is now the basis of our warmaking. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. MORSE. I yield. Mr. CLARK. It has been my under\u00ad standing in the past that the Senator has been of the view that we should not unilaterally withdraw from Vietnam but that we should press for meaningful negotiation, be prepared to come to some kind of arrangement neutralizing Viet\u00ad nam, and eventually get out. Do I understand the Senator correctly that he has never advocated immediate unilateral withdrawal without negotia\u00ad tion? Mr. MORSE. The Senator is correct; and I am not this afternoon. I advo\u00ad cated withdrawing before we had built up our huge military establishment there, but not since 1964. But I am warning that if this policy is carried out with its present inhumanity, and we are able with our great military might to force a sur\u00ad render and thereby set up, not a peace table, but a truce table, we are making a great mistake. Rather than follow that course of action on a unilateral basis I would have us get out before we imple\u00ad ment that course of action. Mr. CLARK. I agree with the Senator, but I think that the Senator will\u00b7agree with me that the alternative which I stated a brief moment ago is a perfectly feasible alternative, and we do not need to go to either extreme. Mr. MORSE. The Senator is correct. However, I am saying that we are going to go to an extreme in this matter by the dictates of the American people in the not too distant future if we continue to follow our present course of action. I say to Members of Congress: \"You will be greatly mistaken if you think that in the 1968 campaign you, as Senators and Congressmen, and the President, as the President of the United States, are going to get the approval of the Ameri\u00ad can people. He may lose the majority; but even if he does not, there will be such a strong minority against him that in my judgment any effectiveness we may have in the councils of the world in trying to lead other nations to peaceful settlement will be greatly damaged.\" Mr. CLARK. I have stated privately, and I am now prepared to state publicly, that in my opinion if we are still fighting the kind of war in Vietnam by July 1, 1968, that we are now fighting, the Dem\u00ad ocratic Party will lose the Presidency and many of us who might otherwise be re-elected, or those who may be elected on the ticket of the Democratic Party will be defeated. Mr. MORSE. I have stated many times, as the Senator will recall, that if we are fighting this war on the basis that we are now by the date that the Senator from Pennsylvania mentioned, July 1, 1968-I shall not support the President for the Democratic nomina\u00ad tion, and I am a candidate myself in 1968. I will not support him because I will not support anyone who makes the historic record he is making, causing the slaughter of increasing numbers of American boys in an undeclared war, not to mention tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians. BASIS FOR U.S. ACTION SHOULD BE CHANGED Mr. President, I have some sugges\u00ad tions I wish to make in this speech as to what I think should constitute some of the changes in American foreign policy. There are two critical factors which underlie the U.S. dilemma in Vietnam. First, Hanoi, and for that matter most other nations, do not believe that the United States will withdraw from Viet\u00ad nam as President Johnson has promised. They cite the permanence of such in\u00ad stallations as Cham Ranh and Sattahip in Thailand. They cite the present building and projected building of great American military bases in the Philippines, around the circumference of the Indian Ocean, and elsewhere in Asia. We do not like to hear it, but the fact is that throughout the world the credi\u00ad bility gap of this administration is so broad that no bridge of truth can span it. The fact is that the Johnson ad\u00ad ministration in many areas of the world is not believed and should not be, for it taxes all comprehension to hear this ad\u00ad ministration saying that we seek no bases, that we have no desire to main\u00ad tain a foothold elsewhere, and then we proceed to spend not millions but bil\u00ad lions of dollars to build the bases. Our actions speak so much louder than the President's words. We have got to take a long hard look at the ex\u00ad istence of the credibility gap. We are not going to change world opinion in regard to its view toward our unreliability measured . by the differences between our words and our acts by further professings that we seek no foothold elsewhere in the world. Second, the increasing commitment of U.S. men and materiel in southeast Asia tends to make the struggle there an American war. Nations in the area are not compelled to use their own troops and develop their own indigenous capac\u00ad ity to resist external aggression or in\u00ad ternal subversion. \u00b7American policy should make it clear that the United States will withdraw from Vietnam at a time certain. U.S. policy should be designed to pressure such states as Japan and India, which in combination with Indonesia and other independent states in the area have more men and industry than China to erect their own barriers to potential Chinese aggression. American policy now, however, has just the opposite effect. U.S. military construction and economic expenditures tell Asians that the United States is there to stay, no matter what the President says. No matter what our President says, these acts also encourage Asian states to leave the job to the United States. The Vietnamese want U.S. forces in the delta, and they are getting them by increasing thousands. We have taken over the war. American soldiers who have been sent into the delta-and they should never have been sent in there-are dying and being wounded without any justification because the Johnson administration is creating this situation. The human sacrifice of American boys is being made to support corrupt, mandarin-type ty\u00ad rants which constitute the American puppet government in Saigon. Oh, the immorality of this situation is not being lost on millions of Americans. It is no longer being lost on the men in the pulpits of America. In almost every community in this broad land, there are clergymen who have come to recognize that the prolonged silence which has characterized too many of the pulpits in this country must come to an end. Thus, in community after community, an increasing number of clergymen are making the point that the Johnson ad\u00ad ministration's war policy in Vietnam is immoral. By every measure, standard, and criterion by which it can be eval\u00ad uated, it is immoral. By all the religious criteria of which we measure morality, increasing numbers not only of church men but also of religious people within our population have come, at long last, to recognize as they sit home, safe and comfortable in their affluence, that the killing of American boys in support of our present policy cannot be justified. That is why my colleagues in the Sen\u00ad ate are greatly concerned when they come and talk to me about the position which the Senator from Alaska [Mr. GRUENING] and I took as we began this debate, saying that they have come to be greatly concerned because they are recognizing that ih their home States they are faced, as Senators, with dis\u00ad unity. That disunity will intensify, not lessen. I cite the parallel of France, not only the debates in the French. Parlia\u00ad ment before the ultimate decision was made fu France, 'which is analogous to the debates now going on in this body, but also the millions of Frenchmen fi\u00ad nally made it clear to their politicians what they thought, as I think millions of Americans will make clear to their politicians before November 1968, exclaiming: \u00b7 We have had enough. We expect you to bring these boys home and stop murdering them. As I have stated once before, and got castigated for it, but I repeat, the killing of a single American boy in the unde\u00ad clared war in Vietnam constitutes, in my\u00b7 judgment, murder. Let its administration come up with a declaration of war and see if they can pass it, and try to make those deaths legal. \u00b7 Senators are going to bear with in\u00ad creasing intensity in the months ahead of the growing resentment of a large 4732 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28,. 1967 part of the people of this country who are in opposition to our failure to act by way of placing checks upon the Pres\u00ad ident, who should have been checked long ago. These suggestions I am making this afternoon bear upon what I consider to be sound recommendations for checking our policy. U.S. policy assumes that U.S. interests demand resistance to aggression wher\u00ad ever it occurs and that it is necessary if we are to contain China. But it can also be argued that U.S. interests require that there not be a long\u00ad term, heavy deployment of American military power on the land mass of Asia and that threatened areas in Asia must themselves coordinate their defenses to counter any threat China may pose. PROPOSAL This is what I would have my Presi\u00ad dent say-I would have him say it first to the Security Council of the United Na\u00ad tions, and if he gets vetoed, then to the General Assembly: First. The United States is receiving no major support from other nations in Vietnam. What other support we have from a few countries-not great powers, not a single one-is token support of practi\u00ad cally no significance. Second. The United States has stated that it has no territorial designs and does not intend to maintain U.S. forces on the land mass of Asia. Third. Americans are now persuaded that the United States should not con\u00ad tinue to carry alone the main burden in manpower and costs to repelling this aggression. Other important states on or near the borders of China do not view the danger as does the United States. Neither China's neighbors nor free world states are taking steps to assist in the defense of South Vietnam. Fourth. The President is, therefore, planning to take steps to prepare for the orderly withdrawal of U.S. forces to designated areas sufficiently large to ac\u00ad commodate refugees should they wish protection. To digress, I was interested in the argument made by the Senator from Missouri [Mr. SYMINGTON] this after\u00ad noon, in the colloquy with the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. CLARK], as to why there is no milltary authority now administering American military power that supports the recommendation of a Gavin. Of course, there is not. That does not mean we ought not follow the advice of a Gavin, a Ridgway, a Kennan, or others, or, by the way, of a General Shoup, who, before his retirement not so long ago, was the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. Why, his statement before the junior college group in Los Angeles on May 14, 1966, makes a con\u00ad servative out of me in all my proposals about the war in Vietnam. The Senator from Indiana [Mr. HARTKE] put that statement in the REc\u00ad ORD the other day. I paraphrase that quotation. He pointed out what the Senator from Alaska [Mr. GRUENING] and I have been saying for three and a half years-that the whole area in which American sol-diers are fighting in South Vietnam is not worth the life of one of them. He is right. The Senator from Missouri can place his case all he wants to on the Wheelers and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Westmorelands. As long as one puts his case on that group of military leaders conducting this war, he is going to continue to permit the unjustifiable killing of increasing hundreds of Amer\u00ad ican boys. What Americans have to do, and what we hope they will do through their elected representatives in Congress, is to make clear to the military that they want this military approach and Amer\u00ad ican foreign policy stopped. Therefore, I want to say to the Senator from Missouri [Mr. SYMINGTON], I am proud to stand on the recommendations of a General Ridgway, and a General Gavin, and a great diplomat, George Kennan. I am proud to stand on the recommendations of a General Eisen\u00ad hower, a General Marshall, a General MacArthur, a General Collins-that whole list of great generals who have warned us in recent years that we should not bog down American land forces in Asia. That the Senator from Missouri [Mr. SYMINGTON], by implication, compared the present Joint Chiefs of Staff and General Westmoreland with these great military advisers of this country is, in my judgment, itself incredible. What we have here is a basic issue as to whether or not the Congress will make clear to the military that\u00b7 it is not going to run American foreign policy. This war is what is putting American foreign policy in disrepute around the world. So, I would hope, as I have said, that my President would announce to the world that we are prepared for the or\u00ad derly withdrawal of U.S. forces to desig\u00ad nated areas sufficiently large to accom\u00ad modate refugees, should they wish pro\u00ad tection. I do not care how it is described. I am for an enclave approach, or whatever else one may wish to call it. I think General Gavin has yet to be successfully rebutted by any military analyst in re\u00ad gard to the soundness of his approach. I have read what Maxwell Taylor has presented as administration rebuttal to the Gavin recommendation. Read the testimony of General Gavin given the other day. He took the Maxwell Taylor book and on this point, in my judgment, demolished it-which is not difficult to do with almost any recommendation Maxwell Taylor makes. It is too bad that the administration has followed his ill advice for so long. To continue with my statement, I would urge the President to cease search\u00ad and-destroy operations. That means I would have my Presi\u00ad dent announce an end of that escalation. To cease further air attacks on enemy targets unless they threaten the areas still occupied by U.S. forces. Fifth. I would have my President an\u00ad nounce that the United States wm main\u00ad tain its military presence in these areas for a period of not to exceed 2 years and will then withdraw them completely un\u00ad less other nations of the world come in to cooperate with us in enforcing the peace and developing an economic paci\u00ad fication program. Sixth. I would have my President point out that the United States would be prepared to reconsider this decision only if requested to do so by a majority of the governments of SEATO, plus the Gov\u00ad ernments of Japan, India, and Indonesia; or if requested to do so by a majority vote of the General Assembly of the United Nations; or if requested to do so by a majority of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. What I am saying in this speech this afternoon is that I think the historic hour has come when the President owes it to the people of the United States and the people of the world to announce a major change in the objective of the United States in southeast Asia. He should make it very clear that we stand ready and willing to cooperate with other nations in a pacification pro\u00ad gram, and a program to prevent a blood bath. I say again, as I have continued to say so often in the last 3 years, that a blood bath would result from a sudden, overnight withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam, that leaves only a vac\u00ad uum behind us. It is bound to happen because of the situation we have created, for which we are primarily responsible. To walk out now from South Vietnam would probably result in a blood bath, so we could not justify precipitate with\u00ad drawal on moral grounds either. The time has come when the President should announce to the world that the policy of unilateral American action in this war is going to be changed; that we are willing to cooperate with other na\u00ad tions in peacekeeping; that we are will\u00ad ing to hold the line for the time being, until they can reach the necessary under\u00ad standings, adopt procedures, consummate agreements, and effectuate an imple\u00ad mentation which would result in the nations of the world as a whole, so to speak, taking over this threat to the peace of the world. But, he should say, we are not going to be the lone policeman to the world. Either we mean that, or we do not. I know what the opposition will say: That it is a surrender; it is appeasement; it is a withdrawal. Mr. President, I will tell you what it is. It is a changing of our course of action from jungle law to adherence to the rule of law. It is in keeping with what I think is our clear legal and moral obligation to the world. CLARK-MORSE AMENDMENT AND THE WAR POWER In the debate this afternoon, great concern was expressed by some Senators with respect to the proposal of the Clark\u00ad Morse amendment that it is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of the amendment should flow in the absence of a declaration of war. Of course, that is the purpose of this amendment. I heard nothing in the debate this afternoon, in\u00ad cluding the observations of the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. CooPER], to justify, as a matter of law, our making war with\u00ad out a declaration of war. Certainly at some point the national commitment be\u00ad comes so great as to require a declara\u00ad tion of war in any international dispute. What is that point? I think the point February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4733 always exists immediately following the development .of the emergency, following the immediate response of the President in the self-defense of the Nation, during the period that it takes him to prepare his war message and present it to a joint session of Congress. Then let Congress work its will upon the President's recom\u00ad mendation. That is the constitutional procedure set forth by the constitutional fathers. It is what they made perfectly clear in their debate in the Constitutional Convention as to why they wrote article I, section 8, with its declaration of war provision, into the Constitution in the first place. Mr. President, you can research all you want the history books, the Constitu\u00ad tional Convention, the record of past Presidents, and you cannot come up with a denial of what I say; namely, that if the country is to be taken into war, it must be taken into the war by a declara\u00ad tion of war. The Clark-Morse resolution seeks to make that clear once again. But in this colloquy this afternoon, as in other col\u00ad loquies on the floor of the Senate, the hypothetical question has been raised, \"At what point must there be a declara\u00ad tion of war?\" When? Can we wait until 2,500 men have been sent on to the battlefield? 1,000? 500,000? 1 million? 2 million? My answer is, except for the men who must be used for that brief period of time to meet the self-defense response, we cannot proceed to send men to their deaths on a battlefield without a declara\u00ad tion of war. Read the message of Frank\u00ad lin Roosevelt following Pearl Harbor. President Roosevelt responded, as was his constitutional right and duty, to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor with such military forces as we were able to draw together after that great catas\u00ad trophe, to respond in the self -defense of the Nation. But he did not prolong the Executive response to the Japanes\u00b7e. He sat down and prepared a war message. He delivered it to Congress the next day. He asked for a declaration of war. He made it perfectly clear that that was his Presidential duty; and, as I have said so many times in the last 3\u00a52 years, it has likewise been the Presidential duty of President Johnson. History will not write a favorable account of his failure to live up to his responsibilities under article I, section 8, of the Constitution. Then the question is raised, \"How can we explain to the young men of this oountry who are protesting the course of action we are following that they should be drafted and sent to war on the basis of Presidential warmaking, but not on the basis of a congressional declaration?'' Students are well versed also, by and large, in the constitutional history of the Republic. I do not like the illegal actions that have characterized some of the stu\u00ad dent reactions in this country; but I al\u00ad ways look for possible provocations to try to find some explanation. Although it is not a justification for a wrong course of action, I am always in\u00ad clined to look for provocations which may have produced the action. I happen to think that until there is a declaration of war, or the issue is faced by Congress, draft card burnings will continue, draft violations will continue, charges of treason will be made, castiga\u00ad tion and abuse of people on both sides of the issue will continue; the rich will get richer-in fact, to paraphrase General Shoup in his speech to that junior col\u00ad lege group in Los Angeles, if we would only keep our crooked business fingers out of the economic aspects of this war, we might not find ourselves involved. Why, Mr. President, the slightest sug\u00ad gestion that the war ought to be paid for by a corporate tax increase brings down on the heads of Members of Congress the lobbying activities of shockingly selfish economic groups who are per\u00ad fectly willing to collect the blood money profits out of this war, and think they should be allowed to pocket them with\u00ad out having imposed upon them a tax in\u00ad crease to help pay for the war. If we could get a war profits tax adopted, Mr. President, we would see a remarkable change in the public attitude of the affluent of this country, who sit in their economic comfort and protection and collect the dollars out of the profits of bloodletting. Mr. President, more and more people are becoming aware of the part that economic selfishness is playing in the urging that we must continue an all-out war until we force a surrender. I am somewhat at a loss to understand the arguments of those who do not think we ought to face up to whether or not we should make a declaration of war. I wonder what they would say if some of us should introduce a joint resolution\u00ad which we cannot in good faith do, be\u00ad cause we would be violently opposed tO it-proposing an amendment to the Constitution giving the President of the United States the sole power to make and declar\u00b7e war. Can you not hear that debate? Can you not hear the reper\u00ad cussions across the land? That would be called the destruction of our system of limited power. It would be denounced as meaning the de\u00ad struction of Congress as an effective party in the National Government. But Members of Congress are quite willing to accept de facto such a proposal. By inaction in this situation, that is what. we have done. We have given to the President the power in fact to declare war. Does it take much argument to point out that if Congress allows the President to exercise such a war power, that would be a power ranking with the tax power? What do Senators think would hap\u00ad pen if it were proposed that we pass a constitutional amendment to give the President exclusive power to tax? What a hullabaloo that would stir. Yet, we sit by here as elected officials of the peo\u00ad ple in Congress and we try to alibi for, exctl.se, and rationalize this shocking ex\u00ad ercise of executive power by the Presi\u00ad dent of the United States. I shall always be proud of the fact that I did not vote for that resolution of Au- gust 1964, which is cited as some con\u00ad donation of the President's war making. If we continue to acquiesce in it, we will go down the last step to total execu\u00ad tive power in this country. If we do that, then the need for Congress ceases to exist in fact, and we will have really moved into a Government by executive power. So the Clark-Morse sense-of-the\u00ad Senate amendment which will soon be pending before the Senate seeks at 'least for educational reasons to educate and display a few warning flags concerning the road that we are headed down. I thought that today was a good day to start a discussion that I shall con\u00ad tinue from time to time advocating a change now, a great change, in the direc\u00ad tion of our policy, a change in which we start to announce to the world: ''We are not going to stay there indefinitely.\" It will be a change in which we announce to the world: We are not going to assume this respon\u00ad sibllity, whatever it is, to maintain order in that part of the world on a unilateral American basis at the expense of the lives and the bloodshed of the American boys that we send over there, in respect to which they really have no real choice of serving because they are patriotic Americans. There is a lot of talk about the pa\u00ad triotism of these soldiers and their bravery and their courage and their dedi\u00ad cation to the cause of t:Qeir country. I yield to no one in joining in that praise, but there is one great difference between my position and the position of many who talk in terms of the great heroic record that these troops are making. That difference is that I raise the ques\u00ad tions: By what right do we have them there? What is the justification for the Congress of the United States permitting a President to continue a presidential war-making power that has resulted ln the k1111ng of those boys? That is why in this debate on the sup\u00ad plemental appropriation authorization as I said yesterday and say again now, I do not intend to vote a single dollar to kill them because voting the money to send them there, to keep them there, and kill them is letting them down. If we really want to support those boys, we can stop their killing by denying the President the money with which to kill them by exercising our constitutional duty under the Constitution to pull the purse strings on the President and deny him the money. For the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. CooPER] to say he does not think Congress will withhold the money is no justification for voting for the appropriation. At what point, may I ask, does a Senator become party to a policy after he votes, year in and year out, for the money to carry it out? I think we are going to find millions of Americans asking us Senators: \"Why did you do it?\" There is another phase of this subject that I want to comment on because at least some of us who are opposed to the supplemental authorization are opposing it because it is an installment appropria\u00ad tion. It is going to be followed with a $12 billion-plus appropriation, and that is going to be followed, when we come to next year's budget, with a defense appro\u00ad priation, of $75 billion-plus out of a total budget of $144 billion. So, I think that before we vote on this $4 billion-plus supplemental bill and the $12 billion\u00ad plus and eventually $75 billion-plus for 4734 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 the building up of the military power of this country, we should realize that if it is not stopped, it is going to make the military or cause the military to con\u00ad tinue to be the most dominant force in the determination of American foreign policy. It is now. American foreign policy is now cut to the cloth of the military, and that is what the military, in my judgment, needs: To have its programs not only in Vietnam but also its fiscal programs here at home deescalated. We need to cut billions and billions and billions of dollars from the Amer\u00ad ican military budget, because only by cutting out those billions, in my judg\u00ad ment, are we going to stop the American military from controlling American foreign policy and building this Ameri\u00ad can military lifeline around the world to supplant the broken and destroyed British Empire's lifeline. If we do not stop it our fate will be the same as the fate of the British Empire-not in my lifetime, not in the lifetime of the younger generation of the country, but within the next century and maybe within the next half a century. For the other nations of the world are not going to countenance the resulting military domination of the United States in many parts of the world that a $75 billion de\u00ad fense budget will put this military in the position of being able to thrust upon the world. The American taxpayers will get wise long before the military gets strong enough to force such a program upon us. But let me say to the American tax\u00ad payers: \"I don't think you have much time.\" We had better take a look at what the military posture of the Amer\u00ad ican military, augmented by the power that they are developing through the world in Vietnam, means to our domes\u00ad tic economy; because in my judgment we are so weakening our domestic economy that if we do not stop it we will contrib\u00ad ute to the ultimate downfall of the Republic. WAR AND GREAT SOCIETY I suppose the remarks that I am about to make can best be summarized by a paragraph from Senator FULBRIGHT's notable book, \"The Arrogance of Power\": Vigorously executed and adequately funded, the legislation adopted by the 89th Congress can open the way to an era of abundance and opportunity for all Amer\u00ad icans, but for the present, at least, the in\u00ad spiration and commitment of the Great Society have disappeared. They have dis\u00ad appeared in the face of our deepening in\u00ad volvement in Vietnam, and although it may be contended that the United States has the material resources to rebuild its society at home while waging war abroad, it is already being demonstrated that we do not have the mental and spiritual resources for such a double effort. Another popular book about current government affairs, \"Lyndon B. John\u00ad son-The Exercise of Power,\" recounts the President's displeasure upon reading a comment of mine made on the Senate fioor last summer, that the Great Society is dead. That does not change the fact that it is dead-dead as a dodo. And I see no indication that Lyndon Baines Johnson is going to resurrect it, eith~r. The Great Society programs, most of them, are on the books, although the failure of the fair housing bill last year marks the evidence that the loss of at\u00ad tention and leadership at the top of our Government and the top of our society has stalemated the drive to equality for colored Americans. But where the pro\u00ad grams are on the books, they are grievi\u00ad ously underfunded, and, more important, they are not attracting the imagination and interest of those whose imagination and interest are vital to their success. The pinch in funds comes from neces\u00ad sity in a budget where $10 to $12 billion was provided for the war in the current year budget, only to fall short by half of the actual cost for the fiscal year 1967. The $12.5 billion supplemental now on its journey through Congress marks an approximate doubling of what was budgeted for the war. Knowledgeable estimates suggested that more is being spent for war activities than even these figures show, and that the actual annual cost of the war is running from $25 to $30 billion a year. It is self-evident that something must give, in the face of an added cost of that magnitude. The \"giving\" has taken place in the impact of a war economy upon the private sector, and in the im\u00ad pact of the war budget upon the rest of the Federal budget. Few Americans are as yet aware of the demands our rising population is placing upon housing. Most of us forget that we, too, are experiencing an exploding popu\u00ad lation, and that accommodating it is more expensive tp a highly industrialized country than to an undeveloped country. Estimates of housing officials indicate that we need 2.5 million new housing starts each year in order to keep pace with population needs. A million and a half are needed each year just to keep pace with new families and to replace dilapidated and razed buildings. But the impact of a war economy hit mortgage funds and interest rates so hard that no more than 1.1 million new starts were achieved last year. So that even while the need rises, the number of new homes actually built last year dropped from the levels of previous years. Nineteen hundred and sixty\u00ad seven is expected to show some improve\u00ad ment, but it will still fall far short of national need.s. A second area of underfunding is in the highway program. Of an estimated $5.2 billion of Federal funds that would normally have been available for high\u00ad way construction, about $3.3 billion was actually made available. According to estimates of the Senate Public Works Committee, another $1% to $2 billion was \"deferred,\" in the language of the Bureau of Public Roads. \u00b7I know there is not a State that did not feel this pinch severely, although funds were withheld in the same percentage as they are disbursed, and hence some lost a greater percentage of funds than others. When I sought an explanation of the deferral from the Bureau, I received the reply which I am sure went to all Sen\u00ad ators. Mr. Rex Whitton, who was then the Director, wrote me: As you know, the current limitation on the federal-aid highway program is being applied in recognition of the need for reduc\u00ad ing federal expenditures as a contribution to the Vietnam effort and the resultant effort to reduce inflationary pressures. Mr. Whitton advised that the funds not obligated will be carried forward and remain available for obligation in the later fiscal years. Meantime, the reve\u00ad nues accruing in the highway trust fund are being invested in Federal bonds, to the credit of the trust fund. This deferral in highway spending is simply a cutback in a domestic program to save the economy that much of the stress of public spending in a war-tight economy. The impact on State highway programs has not been good, and the announcement yesterday that $175 mil\u00ad lion will be released involved engineering and acquisition only, not construction. In an economy in which interest rates rather than taxes have been counted on to offset the economic pressure of the war spending, great stimulus has been given to price escalation. One factor that went into the decision to freeze these highway funds was the contention on the part of the Bureau of Public Roads that construction companies were raising their bids rapidly and uniformly, and that a hiatus in the progress of con\u00ad struction would help bring prices down. Reduction in the domestic programs more specifically identified as the Great Society has been more direct. In the case of the war on poverty, it is difficult to say how much the program was cut, because it is still authorized on an annual basis, and the authorization itself was reduced in 1966 far below what the needs of the program called for. In the Senate Labor Committee, for example, many Senators felt that between $2.5 and $2.7 billion was the sum that the poverty program needed to keep it on the track originally planned for it. But Congress saw fit to authorize only $1.75 billion, and then to appropriate only $1.6 billion. A budget request in the fiscal 1968 budget calls for only $1.86 bil\u00ad lion for the antipoverty program, al\u00ad though it has fallen behind schedule by more than a third in the funds it could usefully be devoting to this purpose had it not been a victim of a war economy. The budget for the war on poverty for fiscal year 1968 will not mark any escala\u00ad tion in that war, but only a stalemate. In 1966, only about 30 percent of the 2% million poor children in the 3-to-5 age group were reached by Headstart. That percentage will not change noticeably in the budgeted program. About 30,000 dropouts from society were enrolled in Job Corps centers ~ast year; about 38,000 are planned for enrollment this year. These are figures anticipated by the administration budget. In a Congress where normal opposition to these pro\u00ad grams exists anyway, the $25 to $30 bil\u00ad lion cost of the Vietnam war will be suffi\u00ad cient excuse to cut back deeply on such a political hot potato as the war on poverty. Education programs, which are of great personal interest to me in my capacity as chairman of the education subcommit\u00ad tee, are also hard hit in the budget. The Library Services and Construction Act, February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4735 for example, which authorizes $50 mil\u00ad lion in 1968 in grants for construction of public libraries, is being funded by little over half that figure-$27 million. The library services section carries an au\u00ad thorization of $45 million, for which $35 million is requested. Under title I of the Higher Education Act, $50 million is authorized for commu\u00ad nity service and continuing education, for which $16% million is requested. Col\u00ad lege library resources are funded only by half-$25 million of the $50 million authorized. Probably of greatest interest is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Under title I, $2.4 billion is author\u00ad ized for 1968 for educationally deprived children, of which half-$1.2 billion-is requested. These cutbacks are needed so we can escalate the war, even though it exposes the American people in the possibility of a third world war. The library resources title for elementary and secondary schools, for which $154 million is author\u00ad ized, is to receive $105 million in the ad\u00ad ministration budget. Title Ill, for sup\u00ad plementary educational centers and serv\u00ad ices, authorizes $515 million for the fiscal year; $240 million is requested. Education of handicapped children, for which $154 million is authorized, would be funded only by $15 million in the budget. In the area of community college con\u00ad struction, the Higher Education Facili\u00ad ties Act authorizes $167 million for this purpose in 1968; $89 million is requested. An authorization is the estimate of the legislative committee of how much can be used effectively in a given program. The Appropriations Committees do not always provide the full sum authorized. But when the Appropriations Commit\u00ad tees start with a budget request that is already half the authorized amount, it is evident that many of these programs are going to receive little more than token funds in 1968 which will keep them alive but will not enable them to accomplish much. In rural areas, too, the budget cuts are going to hurt. I have already indicated the blow struck at the housing industry by high interest rates, a blow that falls harder on rural areas than most people realize. For example, census figures show that nearly half of all substandard housing in the country is in rural areas where less than one-third of the popula\u00ad tion resides. Between 1961 and 1966, re\u00ad habilitation of rural housing had ad\u00ad vanced remarkably, with Farmers Home Administration loans rising from $180 million in the previous 6 years to $850 million in the 1961-66 years. Last year, Congress increased the op\u00ad erating loan authorization of the Farm\u00ad ers Home Administration to $350 million. But the Bureau of the Budget has cut this back to $275 million. Rather than cutting it back, circumstances warrant that operating loan funds for the FHA should actually be in the neighborhood of $700 million-and this would repre\u00ad sent only 5 percent of the total operation credit farmers will need in 1967. Needless to say, the interest rate squeeze that has driven mortgage rates up to 7 percent in some areas of the country has fallen hardest upon low and middle priced homes, driving homeown\u00ad ers in this class almost out of the market. Nor are these rates expected to come down much. Any revival in home con\u00ad struction that takes place will occur largely in the higher priced homes at high interest rates, but money to lend will again be available, whereas last year it simply was not. The impact of this home construction pattern will be very hard on rural hous\u00ad ing. We can only expect from it that the rate of dilapidation in rural areas will rise and not decline. Budgetary curtailment in other rural programs is also a result of the war. Services provided by the Rural Electri\u00ad fication Administration, the Soil Con\u00ad servation Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Forest Service, to mention those most prominent in my own State, will not sustain any revital\u00ad izing of rural life. As with the effort to eradicate urban poverty, the budget fig\u00ad ures mark holding operations. In a Congress where support for most of these programs was severely under\u00ad cut in the Nc}Vember election, they face harder going than in the Budget Bureau. The thrust, the enthusiasm for rebuild\u00ad ing America has been lost. Some of the institutional momentum, which dictates that once business and industry have come to count on a particular source of spending or service it will continue, will maintain programs already begun. But a President and a cabinet whose time and attention these days is devoted to picking targets in North Vietnam, and weighing endless diplomatic details which might lead to peace talks, are not on hand to provide the leadership and sense of purpose that it takes to arouse and interest the American people to the needs of their own country. Today, the administration talks of creating a Great Society in Asia, al\u00ad though the one we started out to build in Latin America 6 years ago has fallen by the wayside, and enthusiasm for the one we hoped to build here has dissi\u00ad pated. Today, the administration spends its time going over details of pacification of South Vietnam, a pacification that the French undertook several times, the Eisenhower administration undertook several times, and the Kennedy admin\u00ad istration undertook several times. The pacification of Watts, and Harlem, and the Hough area of Cleveland, the West Side of Chicago, is left to subordinate officials in the Department of HUD and the Office of Economic Opportunity. This order of priority, which puts the needs of South Vietnam ahead of the needs of the United States, cannot help but result in a freeze in the rehabilita\u00ad tion of the United States in preparation for our own population explosion. In Vietnam, we defoliate thousands of square miles of forest, lay waste to thou\u00ad sands of acres of food-producing areas, burn up villages with flamethrowers and plow them under with bulldozers. The people are herded out of the villages in which they and their ancestors have al\u00ad ways lived, to set up \u00b7life in temporary communal tents, lacking now a past, as well as a present and a future. For all the official publications about the number of wells being dug, the num\u00ad ber of schools built, the handful of doc\u00ad tors serving in South Vietnam, not much is said about how much more we have destroyed there than we have created. Most tragic are the lives we have taken with our military power, lives estimated at 1,000 South Vietnamese civilians a month. These casualties make a mock\u00ad ery of our claim that we are saving the people of Vietnam from Vietcong ter\u00ad rorists, who take the lives of some 700 civilians a year, according to our own statistics .. Their terrorism is shocking, inexcusa\u00ad ble, and morally wrong; but so is the terrorism of the South Vietnamese. Little is ever said by this administration about the brutalities, the inhumanity to man, the shocking wrongs committed upon the bodies of captured Vietcong soldiers. The fact is that we cannot justify the propaganda this administration has been putting out, seeking to justify this illegal, immoral, unjustifiable war. That is why I am taking the time this late in the afternoon to make my record once again, with this new development, in re\u00ad gard to my position that the time has now come for the President to serve no\u00ad tice on the world that the United States will not stay in Vietnam indefinitely, and that we will not continue to stay there on the basis of our present policy of escalating a war in an attempt to force a surrender that will never produce a peace. One of the most knowledgeable of American historians, Prof. Henry Steele Commager of Amherst, recognized by most historians as the dean of American historians, touched on some of the fal\u00ad lacies of power in his recent appearance before the Committee on Foreign Rela\u00ad tions. He said: The word \"power\" is an awkward and even a dangerous one, for it is used in two ways and it is almost fatally easy to confuse the two uses. It is clear that the United States has immense power anywhere on the globe it decides to use it. But it is by no means clear that the United States is, therefore, a world Power, with a capital P. If you have the strength, and do not care overmuch about consequences, it is easy enough to exercise power, but to be a Power is a very different thing, and it is a very difficult thing. I do not think the United States is prepared to be a Power everywhere-in the Western Hemisphere, in Europe, in Asia, nor do I think we should wish to exercise power every\u00ad where .... Although we used something like total power in the Second World War, once vic\u00ad tory had been achieved, we contented our\u00ad selves W..th trying to put the broken frag\u00ad ments of the war-torn world together again. We used aid, we used influence, we used mili\u00ad tary power, but we did not use the ultimate power of the nuclear weapon, nor did we in fact attempt to order the affairs of Asia. It has remained for the statesmen of this decade to insist that we are an Asian power, and have the same kind of responsib11ity fo'l\" Asia that we have for Western Europe. It is my feeling that we do not have the resources-material, intellectual, or moral, to be at once an American power, a European power, and an Asian power .... Perhaps one fifth of our population lives in poverty; we do not have the resources to wipe it out. Our cities are decaying, we 4736 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 do not have the resources to restore them. Our educational enterprise is desperately inadequate; we do not have the resources to bring it up to the standards which we our\u00ad selves set. Our riv\u00b7ers and streams are pol\u00ad luted and the very air we breathe is poisonous but we lack the resources to cleanse these. Racial discrimination and injustice flaunts itself in every section of the nation, but we lack the resources to eradicate them from our society or economy. Crime flaunts itself in the streets of our cities, but we lack the resources to control it. Would it not be wise. if we used our immense power and resources to wipe out poverty and injustice and waste at home before launching ourselves upon crusades to wipe out these things in distant continents? [At this point Mr. HOLLINGS assumed the chair as Presiding Officer .J Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, the dean of the American history professors, in the excerpt from his testimony which I have just read, gives us cause to ponder, and also gives the President of the Unit\u00ad ed States and his advisers in Congress ample cause to ponder. This is the crux of our situation today. All evidence suggests that the American commitment to Asia today exceeds our commi\u00b7tment to ourselves. It remains to be seen how long our burgeoning popu\u00ad lation can tolerate this deplorable order of priority. Mr. President, I have discussed the cause-and-effect relationships between these supplemental authorizations and appropriations for war and our domestic needs so that my colleagues in the Sen\u00ad ate and the people of the United States can see the cause to effect relationship between military expenditures, and deny\u00ad ing to the American people the money necessary to prevent the economy from falling into decay and public opinion to fall into disruption. We must avoid going the way of other governments that fail to give heed to the needs of their own people. We must recognize before it is too late that the prosecution of this undeclared, illegal, immoral, and unjustifiable war in Asia cannot be justified by the President, or by Congress, from the standpoint they accept the protection to which they are entitled. The time has come for Congress to check the President and make clear to him that it wants escalation of this war stopped, to make clear to him that it wants to change the policy and make an announcement to the world, as I have suggested in my speech this afternoon, that if other nations do not proceed to work out a cooperative program to main\u00ad tain the peace in Asia, we will withdraw, because we cannot justify continuing the slaughter of American boys which has already reached the neighborhood \u00b7 of 9,000, and the wounding has reached more than 40,000. We cannot justify continuing the slaughter on the basis of our unilateral action or on the basis, as Professor Commager points out, that we may think we have some right to exer\u00ad cise that kind of world military power. The time to support our boys in Viet\u00ad nam has arrived. In order to support them in my judgment, we have the duty, as my sights see it, to vote against the supplemental appropriation bill, to vote against the next one, and to vote to cut drastically the defense budget of some $75 billion which will be submitted to the Senate before it adjourns. AMERICAN CITIES ARE BECOMING GHETTOS FOR OUR COLORED AMERICANS Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, the cur\u00ad rent issue of the University of Oregon alumni bulletin pubU.shes an article that should be of interest to everyone who is concerned with the problems of Amer\u00ad ican cities and the extent to which they have become ghettos for colored Amer\u00ad icans. I can remember a time when the word ~'ghetto\" brought to our minds a revul\u00ad sion against the narrowmindedness and backwardness of the society of Europe that forced people of the Jewish faith into confined urban quarters. What a sad day has come to America, when the word \"ghetto\" is now a part of our own vocabulary and worse, part of American society. A distinguished alumnus of the Uni\u00ad versity of Oregon is a leading business\u00ad man in the area of Watts in southern California. Although he is perhaps best known for his athletic accomplishments at the university, and later with the Los Angeles Rams in professional football, Mr. Woodley Lewis is one of the people who are coming to grips with the reality of the ghetto, and trying to do some\u00ad thing meaningful about it. The article, \"Quiet Man in an Unquiet City\" in the February issue of Old Oregon speaks for itself, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: QUIET MAN IN AN UNQUIET CITY (By Lucile Vaughan Payne) On the wall of a certain office in Compton, California, is a map of Los Angeles County marked off With clusters of colored pins. The pins are there to show the areas where the black population outnumbers the white. Some of the clusters are small and scattered, each covering no more than a half -dozen or so city blocks. South and east of the city of Los Angeles, however, is a huge, ragged strip of land so thickly encrusted With pins that it stands out from the surface like some giant spreading malignant growth. Here are dozens upon dozens of city blocks occupied almost exclusively by Negroes. Here is Watts, with the history of the coun\u00ad try's worst race riot written in its burned buildings and devastated streets. And here, next to Watts, indistinguishable from it as you drive along the main thoroughfare that joins them, is Compton. On the map the two towns are separated by a thin line, but you do not see the line as the fiat, monotonous panorama of Los Angeles' poorest and ugliest commercial geog\u00ad raphy unrolls outside the windows of a mov\u00ad ing car. One municipality \u00b7 simply merges with the other in an unending succession of drab storefronts, filling stations, repair shops, flop houses, used-car lots, cheap bars. Cross a crowded street, and you are out of Watts, in Compton. . Compton is the home of Woodley Lewis. The name may have a familiar sound. Certainly it will have for football fans. For Woodley Lewis was once a star player for the Los Angeles Rams. And pack in 1949 he was a halfback on the famous U.O. team that went to the Cotton Bowl-a team that included another halfback named Johnny McKay (now head football coach at the Uni\u00ad versity of Southern California) and a quar-terback named Norm Van Brocklln. Woodley LeWis won the award as Oregon's most valu\u00ad able player that year-he was tops in kickoff returns in the nation-and went on from U.O. to pro football. After six years with the Rams, five with the St. Louis Cardinals, Lewis left pro foot\u00ad ball to go into business in Compton. Dick Daugherty, another U.O. alumnus and ex\u00ad Ram player, joined him as a \"silent partner.\" In 1961 they built the Woodley Lewis Sports\u00ad man Bowl, a huge (32-alley) bowling and recreation center, which Lewis manages. It it one of the few recreational facilities avail\u00ad able to the 80,000 people who live in the municipality. The Sportsman Bowl is in the heart of the high-unemployment and school-dropout area. Although Negroes and Caucasians mingle casually in its bar and restaurant and around the polished, gleaming alleys with their constant cannonade of rolling balls, few of them have much money to spend. And their number has decreased since the Watts riot. \"Businesses are touch\u00ad and-go propositions in this area,\" says Lewis. \"Especially now.\" Lewis' experience as a businessman and, in an oblique way, his experiencJ as a pro football player, have given him some special insights into the problems that beset the huge, troubled area where most of Los An\u00ad geles' Negro population lives. They are in\u00ad sights all the more interesting because they come from a Negro whose own life had been only lightly touched by racial\u00b7problems, who came late to any genuine reaUzation of them. Lewis seems to have been, always, oddly im\u00ad mune to prejudice, almost unaware of it. Perhaps the simplest explanation for this immunity was his own personality: every\u00ad body always liked Woodley LeWis. He was one of those lucky people born, apparently, with the kind of inner strength and pride, the natural warmth and humor that made him at home in the world everywhere, in any company, and made nonsense of racial barriers. Everybody liked young Woodley Lewis. Everybody respected him. He hardly knew the meaning of a term like \"racial problems.\" How intensely concerned With racial prob\u00ad lems Woodley Lewis is today, however, can be seen in a number of ways. One of the most vivid is just inside the door of his office in the Sportsman Bowl. There on the wall is the map With the colored pins. \"I lived here as a kid,\" says Lewis, touching a cluster of pins near the northern end of the long, ragged area that includes Watts and Compton. \"It was just a small Negro neighborhood then, a little island of Negro homes and businesses. Since then, it has spread out, joined with other islands. Now you have all this.\" His hand brushes the sweep of thickly clustered pins, the miles of city streets. \"As soon as a Negro family moves next door, you see, or across the street, or even a block away, the white people start moving out. Pretty soon it's all Negro.\" His voice contains no anger; he looks thoughtful, detached, restless, a little puz\u00ad zled, as though it st111 surprises him to look at the map, as though he is trying to think of some practical way to solve the staggering problems it represents. \"Most of the people who live in this area don't work in it,\" he says. \"They have to commute to other areas to get to their jobs- 92 percent of them commute. There just aren't any jobs for them here. That's our biggest problem. That and the fact that a lot of people simply don't have jobs of any kind, anywhere. And can't get them. If you want a simple explanation of the Watts riot, that's it.\" If Woodley Lewis 1i angry about the con\u00ad ditions he sees around him, it does not show; his face is not much different from that of the 1949 football player who raced for a 92- yard touchdown in the last few seconds of the last game. of the season against O.S.U., the face of the kid that everybody Uked; February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4737 faintly reserved but friendly, confident, with a look of shrewd good humor around the eyes. He stm has the light, swift step of the track runner (he was one of \"Bowerman's boys,\" a two-year letterman in track as well as football) , the look of a man who knows who he is and where he is going. In football that meant running faster and playing harder than anybody playing against him, quickly and coolly sizing up a problem and moving quickly to solve it. In business it has meant much the same thing; he works, as a matter of course, a 14 or 15-hour day and st111 manages to spend a greaJt deal of time on community problems; he is a mem\u00ad ber of the board of directors of the Compton Chamber of Commerce and the Southern Area Boys' Club, is area council representa\u00ad tive to Boy Scouts of America, and serves on the Citizens Advisory Staff for the Los An\u00ad geles County district attorney. He believes the only way to solve the problems of the ghetto, including his own problems as a busi\u00ad nessman, is through community action; he is too busy trying to solve the problem to take time to be angry. He was lucky, of course. He had a child\u00ad hood he remembers without bitterness; his father had a job (he was a waiter on the Union Pacific Railroad), he had a home, fam\u00ad ily, many friends. And he had the physical and mental confidence of the born athlete. Sports led him to college, through a football scholarship, first to -Los Angeles City College, then as a sophomore to Oregon, where he ma\u00ad jored in political science. Why political science? \"I guess I had some idea then that I wanted to go to South Amer\u00ad ica,\" says Lewis. \"But basically I was just a liberal arts student trying to decide where to land.\" He grins ruefully. \"Too bad I didn't land in business. I took one of those business short courses before buying the Bowl. Three weeks of training. I should have had five years. I had to learn every\u00ad thing about the food and liquor business the hard way, and it was rough going around here at first.\" It's still far from easy. But the Bowl is now relatively well established in Compton, with 50 employees (which makes it an enter\u00ad prise of considerable importance in the com\u00ad munity) and a share-the-profit incentive program in which Lewis takes a good deal of pride. From the pretty girl who works at the counter above the booming alleys to the men who polish the wood, you get the sense of shared enterprise, of personal involve\u00ad ment--and of affection for Lewis. He is still, quite obviously, the boy that everybody likes and respects. He is no stranger to hard work. As a stu\u00ad dent at Oregon he earned $71.20 monthly on a work detail for the Athletic Department. Room, board, and insurance came to $80. \"Ends,\" he says with his quick, ironic smile, \"didn't quite meet.\" So he worked week\u00ad ends-when he wasn't making touchdowns\u00ad chopping weeds, cleaning floors, washing windows. He managed, simultaneously, to maintain above-average grades and a happy social life. He remembers his years at U.O. with warmth and affection. \"I made lots of friends up there,\" he says. He also met a girl named Mitzi Nagasaka '51, a major in general social science. A year after he joined the Rams, they were married. They have two children, a boy and girl, Craig, 13, and Page, 11. Oddly enough, it was Lewis' experience with the Rams that finally brought him into real contact with social problems. For a couple of years he \"loafed and lived it up\" during the football off-season. \"Then I be\u00ad gan to realize that I'd better get a job and live on it, or I'd wind up a bum, an ex-foot\u00ad ball player without a dime and no place to go.\" He discovered that it wasn't too easy for a Negro to get a job-even a Negro who was a nationally known football player. He was CXIII--30~Part 4 turned down, for example, when he applied for work as a parking attendant at the race\u00ad track. Apparently that was a trifle too grandiose a job for a man with a black skin to hope for, back in 1952. Fortunately, Lewis heard that the juvenile court was looking for athletes to serve as probation officers. He applied and got a job. For nine years thereafter he worked dur\u00ad ing the football off-season as a counselor at a detention home for some of the toughest youngsters the streets of Los Angeles ever spawned. They included boys ol' every race and of every level of criminal development-\u00ad some were first offenders, some were hard\u00ad ened young veterans. Too young for jail, too tough for their parents to handle, they had won their sti\"ipes for car thefts, strong\u00ad arm robbery, kni:fings, shoot-outs, arson, even attempted murder. Lewis won their respect immediately; to these boys, the only law-abiding adult worth respect was an athlete. He played ball with them, talked to them, relieved them of con\u00ad traband knives and cigarettes, broke up their fights, and listened to them. He came away from that experience with some very firm convictions about the causes of juvenile\u00ad and adult--delinquency. Most of the boys had known nothing but poverty, and most came from broken homes. \"It all starts in the home,\" says Lewis. \"And one of the big reasons it starts is that the image of the father has been lost. The father's no longer the strong guy. When he used to say 'jump,' the kids jumped. Now when he says it, he jumps-and everybOdy \u00b7 laughs at him.\" Lewis points to the Watts area around him, with its low income and high desertion rate. Because society has made it difficult for a Negro man to support his family, the man loses his self-respect, allows the woman to take over the entire responsibility for the family. \"How can you expect a kid to grow. into a man, if he has no man around to model himself on? What can he know about the meaning or value of work when he's spent his life watching this mother wait for the welfare check to come every month? \"I believe that classes should be developed for people on public assistance,\" says Lewis. \"And they should be\u00b7 required to attend. They need to earn that money, even if it's just for going to class. People have to have something to do, they've got to feel they're worth something, \u00b7 that they've got some\u00ad thing to live for. That's what brought on the WattS riot--too many people with noth\u00ad ing at all to do. If we can't provide jobs for them, we can at least provide classes and require them to go. People on public assist\u00ad ance just rot away because their lives have no meaning or purpose; they're just being kept alive, and they know it.\" Although stores near Lewis' business were looted and a grocery store only four blocks from the Sportsman Bowl was burned to the ground the night of the Watts riot, the Bowl was not attacked. \"Maybe I was spared be\u00ad cause I've worked hard for this community, and people know it,\" says Lewis. \"A lot of people were doing everything they could to help me protect myself. Certainly the ma\u00ad jority of the people were against the riots.\" He believes that the people are tired now, that violence is not likely to flare up again if the people feel that an honest attempt is being made to help them solve the unem\u00ad ployment problem. But the only real hope for an area like Watts, he says, is to rebuild and redevelop it. He hopes for urban re\u00ad development on a broad scale. \"The only way to eliminate slums is to build new areas and relocate people. An old area will always have problems. It's like an old car. You can repair it, and repair it, and then finally you've got to have a new car, the old one just won't run. Communities are like that.\" Sooner or later, he believes, the problems that grip the whole grim complex of streets and neighborhoods that make up Los Ange\u00ad les' Negro ghetto will pe solved. \"We've got good people here. All they need is a chance.\" Optimistically, he speaks of developing, eventually, an entire shopping center for the area. \"Some day,\" he says. \"Some day.\" \u00b7He stops beside the map on his office wall and stares at the colored pins clustered so thickly around Watts and Compton. \"I believe the area can be redeveloped,\" he says. \"I really do.\" ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO ELE\u00ad MENTARY AND SECONDARY EDU\u00ad CATION Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, the President of the United States has today submitted to Congress his recommenda\u00ad tions for legislation in the elementary and secondary as well as the higher edu\u00ad cation areas. Since the draft bills sub\u00ad mitted in mimeograph form run to 42 and 68 mimeographed pages, respec\u00ad tively, I cannot in all candor say that I have reviewed each and every comma of the proposals as thoroughly as I could have wished. However, the Office of Education did provide, with each of the draft bills, a fact sheet setting forth the principal provisions. The President, further, in his message has provided us with much helpful ma\u00ad terial interpreting his approach to the legislation. In view of these facts and in view of the respect which is due the office of the Presidency and the recom\u00ad mendations which the President sends to the Congress, it is my belief that the legislation should \u00b7be introduced at this time so that all Senators may have an opportunity to weigh and to analyze the proposals which have been put forward. There is no question in my mind that widespread agreement in the Senate can be obtained for the extension of pro\u00ad grams which have proven their merit over time. A quick review of the justi\u00ad fications prepared by the Office of Edu\u00ad cation would' indicate there is much merit in many of the new proposals put forward. Some of these may meet with questioning but the proper forum for the resolution of any difficulties that may arise are the committee sessions on the legislation following an analysis of the testimony presented at full and open hearings. Mr. President, in order that Senators may have full information on the Presi\u00ad dent's proposals, I ask unanimous con\u00ad test that the text of the bills, the fact sheets pertaining thereto and that por\u00ad tion of the President's message relating to the educational proposals be printed at this point in my remarks. Mr. President, I send to the desk the two measures to which I have alluded and ask unanimous consent that they be appropriately referred. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bills will be received and appropriately referred; and, without objection, the bills will be printed in the RECORD, together with the fact sheets pertaining thereto, and the pertinent portion of the Presi\u00ad dent's message. The bills, introduced by Mr. MoRsE, were received, read twice by their titles, referred to the Committee on Labor and 4738 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 Public Welfare, and ordered to be printed in the REcORD, as follows: s. 1125 A' b111 to strengthen and improve programs of assistance for elementary and secondary education by extending authority for al\u00ad location of funds to be used for education of Indian children and children in over\u00ad seas dependents schools of the Department of Defense, by extending and amending the National Teacher Corps program, by pro\u00ad viding assistance for comprehensive edu\u00ad cational planning, and by improving pro\u00ad grams of education for the handicapped; to improve programs of vocational educa\u00ad tion; to improve authority for assistance to schools in federally impacted areas and areas suffering a major disaster; and for other purposes.

The fact sheets presented by Mr. MoRsE are as follows: [From the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare] ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1967 I. FACT SHEET: NATIONAL TEACHER CORPS Background and need The National Teacher Corps otfers new hope for blighted schools, both in\u00b7 urban slums and in remote rural areas. It otfers hope of increased educational opportunities for America's 8 million impoverished chil- . dren, by training new manpower in the edu\u00ad cation of the disadvantaged. It offers new ways to tap idealism and motivation for pub\u00ad lic service, as a major factor in the national commitment to the elimination of educa\u00ad tional deprivation through the partnership of governmental and voluntary action. Studies have shown that many of the eco\u00ad nomically deprived are also educationally de\u00ad prived. Their schools are more likely to be understatfed and overcrowded. Their teach\u00ad ers are more apt to be poorly qualified for the difficult tasks they face. Curricular ma\u00ad terials are less likely to be available and up to date. The children themselves face other limitations: impoverished family background and environment, lack of books and reading materials at home, absence of cultural ex\u00ad periences common to middle-class homes, low self-esteem. The problem must not be underestimated. Only one in four nonwhite children out\u00ad side metropolitan areas is enrolled in school at age 5, compared with half the white chil\u00ad dren in the same parts of the country. In metropolitan areas, about three-fourths of all children, both white and nonwhite, are in school at age 5. Nearly a millton Spanish-speaking children in Southwestern States are unlikely ever to get beyond the eighth grade. Many are only vaguely fam111ar with English and, since they attend schools where classes are taught in English and speaking Spanish frequently for\u00ad bidden, they fall behind in the first grade and progressively further behind thereafter. In the metropolitan Northeast, the average Negro student is about 1.6 years behind the average white student in scholastic achieve\u00ad ment in the sixth grade, 2.4 years behind in the ninth grade, and 3.3 years behind in the twelfth grade. In the South, both white and Negro students score below their northern counterparts. Severe teacher shortages have plagued school districts across the Nation. A recent survey of 39 States showed that last Septem\u00ad ber, 20 had substantial shortages of appli\u00ad cants for teaching positions; elementary school teachers were most in demand. Shortages affected communities of every size: 37 States lacked teachers for rural areas; 33 lacked teachers for small cities, 22 for large central cities, and 19 for suburbs. Within a single system, however, the great\u00ad est demand for teachers occurs in im\u00ad poverished schools; in these areas, school of\u00ad ficials experienced great di1!iculty in recruit-ing both beginning and experienced teachers. In Philadelphia, for example, the overall teaching staff vacancy rate was nearly 11 percent at the beginning of this school year; in elementary schools in poverty areas of the city, the vacancy rate was almost 20 percent. On opening day, New York City had to mobilize a 500-man substitute teacher force for full-time duty. The National Teacher Corps will help to meet these needs. It has, at present, 262 veteran teachers and 965 college graduate interns who are working to build profes\u00ad sional careers in teaching disadvantaged children. They serve in 275 schools in 111 school systems, with the cooperation of 50 university training centers in 29 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. There are Teacher Corps teaxns in 20 of the Nation's 25 largest cities, among them: New York, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Cleveland, San Diego, Buffalo, and Memphis. There are Teacher Corps teams in Appalachian towns and in the Ozarks, in Spanish-speaking com\u00ad munities in New York, Florida, California, and the Southwest. Teacher Corps members serve at the re\u00ad quest of the local schools in a program worked out by the State department of edu\u00ad cation, the school system, and~ local univer\u00ad sity. They work in teams, with a veteran teacher serving as team leader for 3-10 interns. Part of a Corps member's time is spent in and about the schools in which lie teaches, and part in study at a nearby university. At the end of 2 years, the interns will have earned a master's degree and w111 be qualified as specialists in the education of the dis\u00ad advantaged. The Corps has had no problem with re\u00ad cruitment of persons to teach in slum schools and rural areas. On the contrary, 13,000 persons applied for membership in 1965. Those selected were all college grad\u00ad uates; they were chosen on the basis of teaching experience (in the case of team leaders) and of academic achievement (in the case of interns). They are paid at the salary rates in etfect in the school district in which they teach. Since 70 percent of the projects deal with elementary school children, the National Teacher Corps should have substantial impact on a critical areas of need--education of children of poverty in the early grades. Proposal The National Teacher Corps program would become a special part of Title I of the Ele\u00ad mentary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and would be extended for three years, through fiscal year 1970, plus authority to enable a teacher-intern to continue his pro\u00ad gram of practical and academic training for a period of not more than one year, for those who begin such training during fiscal year 1970. Teacher-interns would be compensated at the lowest rate for teaching full-time in the school system in which they teach, as they are under existing law, or at the rate of $75 per week plus $15 per dependent, whichever is less. State educational agency approval of the local educational agency's request for Corps members and of the training program otfered by an institution or university would be re\u00ad quired. Teacher Corps members would be per\u00ad mitted to be assigned to a migrant group not in a regular school, who are taught by a pub\u00ad lic or other nonprofit agency, if the number of migrant children makes such an assign\u00adment feasible. The Commissioner of Education would be authorized to accept gifts on behalf of the Teacher Corps, in the same way as the Peace Corps is authorized to accept gifts. Teacher Corps members would be perxnitted to be assigned to schools opera ted by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The \"Local Control\" section would be amended to make it clear that no Teacher Corps member may be assigned to a local educational agency unless the agency finds the member acceptable. II. FACT SHEET: COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATIONAL PLANNING Background and Need Rational planning at an levels is essential if the Nation's educational needs are to be met. Reliable information concerning the effectiveness of existing education prograxns must be obtained and objectively evaluated in order to better coordinate and improve present programs and to develop new pro\u00ad grams to fill unmet needs. Local educational agencies receive funds from three primary sources-the local, State, and Federal Governments. Each school dis\u00ad trict must plan the use of those funds to meet local needs. However, almost all Federal funds and some State funds are earmarked for special purposes. The number of edu\u00ad cation programs designed to meet special needs has increased to the point that some districts have hired special coordinators to work the various programs together into a comprehensive plan adapted to local needs. However, neither the local schools nor the States have the resources to extend this local coordination and short-range planning to a long-range project of regional or Statewide planning and coordination. During the 1965-66 school year, $27 bUlion was spent on education by local education agencies. With expenditures of that magni\u00ad tude, a program of systematic Statewide plan\u00ad ning and evaluation must be established if duplication is to be avoided and maximum efficiency is to be attained. If the evaluation and planning of educa\u00ad tion programs is to be effective, it must be carried out close to the people to be served by those programs. The American system of education is founded on the principle of State and local control. The responsib111ty for edu\u00ad cational planning, therefore, rests at the State and local levels. State educational agencies now set standards for our schools and qualifications for our teachers. Local schools are directly responsible to local school boards. The best planning-that which will be most responsive to the needs of the per\u00ad sons to be served-must be carried out at the State and local levels. If State and local educational agencies are to continue to carry out their present role in educational planning and if the adminis\u00ad tration of Federal educational programs is to refiect the intent of Congress, the Federal Government must share some of the burden placed on those agencies. This can be done by assisting them in developing comprehen\u00ad sive systems of planning and evaluation which will aid them in meeting educational goals at all levels of education, from preschool programs through postgraduate education. Proposal Title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act would be amended to estab\u00ad lish a 5-year program of grants to States by the Comxnissioner of Education for programs of comprehensive, systematic, and contin\u00ad uous planning, and for evaluation of edu\u00ad cation at all levels, except that the inclu\u00ad sion of the field of higher education would be optional with the State. Any State de\u00ad siring to receive a grant would designate or establish a State agency to be responsible for carrying out, or supervising the carrying out, of the comprehenlSive planning, except that, if the State so decided, the planning for high\u00ad er education could be carried out by a sepa\u00ad rate agency, provided that there was as\u00ad surance of effective coordination between the two. To be eligible for a grant, the pro\u00ad grams set forth in the \u00b7State's application would include: setting educational goals; developing through analysis alternate means of achieving these goals; planning new and 4754 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 improved programs on the basis of these analyses; developing and strengthening the competencies of the States for conducting objective evaluations of educational pro\u00ad grams; and collecting, compiling, and ana\u00ad lyzing significant data concerning edu_cation in the State. State applications would be submitted to the Governors for their review and recommendations. Seventy-five percent of the funds appro\u00ad priated would be apportioned among the States, the District of Columbia, and the out\u00ad lying areas for grants according to State plans. The remainder of the appropriation would be reserved for grants to public and private nonprofit agencies, institutions, or organizations for special projects related to educational planning and evaluation on an interstate, regional, or metropolitan area basis. $15 million would be authorized for com\u00ad prehensive planning for fiscal year 1968. Ill. FACT SHEET: INNOVATION IN VOCA\u00ad TIONAL EDUCATION Background and Need The changing character of the American economy and the resulting change in man\u00ad power needs require that our schools antic\u00ad ipate the demands which will be m.a4e of their \u00b7students in the future. In the next few years, employment opportunities in the professional, semi.;profession~l. and techni\u00ad cal fields will increase more than .40 per\u00ad cent, while job oppor~unities for unskilled workers and agricultural workers will actual\u00ad ly decline. Opportunities in public service, in business, and in the professional and per\u00ad sonal service fields are expected to increase at a much faster rate than in other areas. These shifts in the structure of the Amer\u00ad ican labor market impose ever-increasing de\u00ad mands upon high school students. , They must make decisions about schools which affect their entire lives, when they know very little about opportunities which will be available to them. The job of our Nation's schools is particu\u00ad larly critical in view of the large number of workers under 25 years of age who will be continuing to enter the labor force. From 1965 to 1970, the number of persons 20 to 24 years old in the job market will be increas\u00ad ing by close to 500,000 or 4.8 percent per year-2Y:z times the rate for the labor force as a whole. By 1970 there may be close to 12 million of these young adult workers, rep\u00ad resenting about 14 percent of the total labor force, compared with 10 percent in 1960. Overall, the total number of teenage and young adult workers (aged 14 to 24) is ex\u00ad pected to increase by almost 700,000 a year, constituting about 45 percent of the increase in the labor force between now and 1970. More than one million students drop out of school each year. Of the students now in the fifth grade, approximately 80 percent will not complete college. A large number of these students will not receive the education or training which will prepare them to adapt to the jobs available ten or twenty years from now. If they are to develop to their greatest potential as wage earners and as cit\u00ad izens, school programs must be designed to keep them in school, and these programs must prepare them to function in an in\u00ad creasingly complex society. Failure to meet the needs of students in high schools results in lessened employment opportunities. The unemployment rate for high school age youth is more than three times that of the public at large. The unem\u00ad ployment rate among those who fail to finish high school is 50 percent greater than among those who complete high school-in spite of an expanding economy. The secondary school system of the Unit\u00ad ed States must be strengthened to enable it to be more responsive to the needs, inter\u00ad ests, ab111ties, and problems of all students and to the current and long-term demands of the world of work. This is especially . true in the case of disadvantaged students. High school may be their last opportunity for formal education unless they are stimulated to continue on to college, and unless they receive training for employment they may be doomed to a life of unemployment. For stu- \\ dents who do not-plan to go to college, high school may be the last opportunity to prepare for, or receive training for, a job. Proposal The Vocational Education Act of 1963 would be amended to establish a 5-year pro\u00ad gram of grants to State vocational boards, local educational agencies, and public and private agencies, organizations, and institu\u00ad tions to support the planning, development, and operation of innovative occupational ed- \u00b7ucation programs which may serve as models for vocational education programs. Exam\u00ad ples of the types of projects which might be supported are: Exploratory occupational education pro\u00ad grams to provide practical and educational experiences essential to understanding the demands and complexities of our modern society and opportunities in the constantly\u00ad changing world of work. \u00b7These programs would be designed to fam111arize students \u00b7with the broad range of occupations avail\u00ad able to them and requisites for careers in the various occupations. Programs or projects to provide to stu\u00ad dents educational experience through part\u00ad time work to assist in their maximum devel\u00ad opment and to help in linking school and employment. Such progr.ams would assist needy students to continue their education; promote a sense of achievement in school\u00ad related work experiences; enlarge education\u00ad al opportunities; develop recognition of the value of work; and establish communication channels between education and the world of work which are not now in existence. Guidance and counseling to assure that all students' interests and capab111ties are developed in relation to their career objec\u00ad tives and to ease in the transition from school to work by assisting them in initial job placement. Improvement of curricula to stimulate broad-scale innovative changes to provide more realistic vocational education pro\u00ad grams for youth and adults at all skill levels. The curriculum changes would involve new instructional media; improved curriculum guides; and innovative techniques and serv\u00ad ices designed to meet the needs of youth and adults for entry into the world of work or for continuing education at the post-secondary level. The funds appropriated would be appor\u00ad tioned among the States and outlying areas as follows: $150,000 would be apportioned to each State and outlying area, and the re\u00ad mainder would be apportioned according to population aged 14 through 19. $30 mlllion woUld be authorized for fiscal year 1968. IV. FACT SHEET: EXPANDED EDU:CATIONAL OP\u00ad PORTUNITIES FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN Background and Need During the past decade, the foundation has been laid for a comprehensive program of support for educational programs and serv\u00ad ices for mentally retarded, hearing and speech impaired, deaf, visually handicapped, seriously emotionally disturbed, crippled, and other health impaired children. Beginning with the Cooperative Research Act in 1954, Congress has enacted legislation to provide assistance for research and demonstration projects and for personnel training programs in the education of handicapped children. Over 32,000 fellowships and training grants have been awarded in all areas of education for the handicapped. Last year 8,300 grants were awarded in the area of teaching pro\u00ad grams for handicapped children. The Cap\u00ad tioned Films for the Deaf program, twice amended since 1958, now includes research, training, production and dissemination ac-tivities which are reaching an annual audi\u00ad ence of 1.5 million. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 offers direct educational benefits to :P,andicapped children. In addition, it was amended to include State-operated or -sup\u00ad ported schools which provide free public edu\u00ad cation to handicapped chl.ldren. Also en\u00ad acted in 1965 was the National Technical Institute for the Deaf Act. This Institute will supplement the post-secondary educa\u00ad tional opportunities for the deaf provided only by Gallaudet College. In the summer of 1966, an HEW Task Force on Handicapped Children and Child Development reviewed the Department's programs for the handi\u00ad capped and suggested priorities of effort and means for improved coordination of pro\u00ad grams. In the last days of the 89th Congress, two important pieces of legislation for handi\u00ad capped children were enacted. One author\u00ad ized the Model Secondary School for the Deaf at Gallaudet College. The other added Title VI-Education of Handicapped Children-to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This title authorized earmarked funds for projects to develop education programs for the handicapped, and directed the Office of Education to estab~ish a Bureau for the Educa~ion of the Handicapped. The estab\u00ad lishment of the new Bureau was announced by the Office of Education on January 12, 1967. . Although these enactments provide an impre~ive foundation for research, profes\u00ad sional training, and development of special education P.rograms for 1.\\andicapped chil\u00ad c:tren, we must continue to expand their edu\u00ad cational opportunities. Of the estimated 5 million children, or 1,0 percent of the school-age population, appre\u00ad ciably limited by one or more handicapping conditions, only about 40 percent are re\u00ad ceiving the benefits of special education pro\u00ad grams. Half of the public school systems in the United States report that they do not provide educational services for even one type of handicapping condition. Little beyond verbal acknowledgment has been provided for the education of hundreds of multiple handicapped children. Some handicapped children must remain on resi\u00ad dential school waiting lists 6 or 6 years before being accepted into an education program; this almost destroys a child's chance to pre\u00ad pare for his future and to prepare to con\u00ad tribute to our Nation's future. Early diagnosis and identification of a handicapping condition is essential and basic to formulating an education program for a handicapped child. There should be a focal point at which such diagnosis can be pro\u00ad vided to help decide how best to allocate available resources ~ to meet the needs of all handicapped children. The great obstacle to developing and pro\u00ad viding educational programs for handicapped children is the critical shortage of trained personnel-teachers, teachers of teauhers, supportive personnel. Of the estimated 300,- 000 teachers and other personnel necessary to provide educational opportunities to all handicapped children within this decade, there are now only about 70,000. And at this time, there are only about 300 institutions of higher education capable of offering train\u00ad ing for the preparation of professional per\u00ad sonnel, often only in one area. If the 300,000 goal is to be attained, a nationwide personnel recruitment program, utilizing comprehen\u00ad sive and innovative information-dissemina\u00ad tion methods, must be immediately initiated. Proposal The proposed amendments for improve\u00ad ment of the education of the hadicapped would provide a variety of expanded educa\u00ad tional opportunities for all handicapped chil\u00ad dren. The proposed Regional Resource Cen\u00ad ters, which would be authorized by a separate part of title VI of the Elementary and Sec-February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4755 ondary Education Act of 1965, would provide testing and evaluation services to determine the special educational needs of a handi\u00ad capped child, would develop education pro\u00ad grams to J;Ueet these special needs, and would .assist schools and other agencies in their respective regions in providing these educa\u00ad tional programs for the handicapped child. $7.5 million would be authorized for the Centers for fiscal year 1968. The proposal for Recruitment of Personnel and Dissemination of Information on Educa\u00ad tion of the Handicapped would provide grants to or contracts with public or private agen\u00ad cies or institutions to expand and encourage intensive nati_onwide recruitment programs and information dissemination progr~ms aimed at encouraging students, professional and supportive personnel to work in the field of education of handicapped children .. $1 million would be authorized to implement this program in fiscal year 1968. Schools for Indian children operated by the Department of the Interior and overseas dependents schools operated by the Depart\u00ad ment of Defense would be made eligible for assistance under title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The proposal for Expansion of Instruc\u00ad tional Media Programs to Include All Handi\u00ad capped Children would insure that all handi\u00ad capped children would receive the demon\u00ad strated benefits- of the instructional media materials program established and success\u00ad fully carried out under the Captioned Films for the Deaf program and would greatly help ln shortening the time lag between -new edu\u00ad cational media discoveries and their actual applications. $1 million would be authorized in fiscal year 1968 for this expanded pro\u00ad gram. Existing authority to make grants for re- search in the education of the handicapped would be made more flexible by authorizing the Government to obtain such research through contracts with public or private educational research agencies and orga\u00ad nizations. V. FACT SHEET: MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS TO THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDAI!.Y EDU\u00ad CATION ACT AND THE FEDERALLY IMPACTED AREAS PROGRAM Indian children in BIA schools and children in DOD overseas dependents schools Background and Need Last year, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 was amended to in\u00ad clude two groups of children-Indian chil\u00ad dren in schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the In\u00ad terior and children in overseas dependents schools operated by the Department of De\u00ad fense--who had not been afforded the edu\u00ad cational benefits offered other children un\u00ad der the Act. Indian children in BIA schools were made eligible to participate in programs conducted under Titles I, II, and III of the Act; Department of Defense schools were in\u00ad cluded in the provisions of Titles II and III. The benefits to the two groups of children have been substantial. It is estimated that 37,000 Indian children will be reached by special programs for the educationally de\u00ad prived under Title I of ESEA, at a total cost of more than $5 million. More than $125,\u00ad ooo will be spent in providing these children with textbooks, library books, and other in\u00ad structional materials during this fiscal year, and nearly $205,000 will be expended on sup\u00ad plementary educational centers and services under Title III. Overseas schools will also reap the benefits of change during this fiscal year: more than $404,000 for books and in\u00ad structional materials under Title II, and $527,000 for supplementary educational cen\u00ad ters and services under Title III. Proposal Provisions for participation of Indian chil\u00ad dren enrolled in BIA schools and of chil\u00ad dren in overseas dependents schools would be extended one year, through fiscal year 1968. These provisions would otherwise ex\u00ad pire at the end of-fiscal year 1967. Exten\u00ad sion would make them uniform with\u00b7the rest of the Act, which continu~s through fis,cal year 1968. A study of the provisions ap.d further recomme \u00b7ndations will be submitted to the Congress later this year. Amendment to Title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act In order to provide for a more equitable distribution of Title V funds the allotment formula would be amended. Forty percent of the amount available for apportionment among the States would be allotted to the States in equal amounts and the remaining 60 percent would be allotted to the States on the basis of school age population. Amendments to Disaster Authority in Public Laws 874 and 815 _ Background and Need Public Law 81-815 and Title I of Pubiic Law 81-874 were a.mended by P.L. 89-313, approved November 1, 1965, to give the Com\u00ad missioner of Educatiol). authority, until June 30, 1967, to provide assistance to repair or replace school facilities damaged or de\u00ad stroyed by natural disasters, to provide tem\u00ad porary facilities while damaged facilities were being repaired or rebuilt, and to provide op\u00ad erating assistance as might be needed in any area declared by the President to be a major disaster area. Prior to these amendments, such disaster assistance was-provided by the Office of Emergency Planning. Although this was a new program for the Office of Educa-tion, it has worked well in meeting the most ui-gent needs in disaster areas. There were 11 dis\u00ad asters during fiscal year 1966 and two dis\u00ad asters thus far in fiscal year 1967 for Which applications for aid have been received. The total cost of the disaster program for apPli\u00ad cations received, as of February 1967, exclu\u00ad sive of Hurricane Betsy, is estima-ted to be $375,000. Proposal Authority to provide disaster assistance under Public Laws\u00b7 815 and 874 .would be extended to\u00b7 five years, through fiscal year 1972. Coverage would be extended to a few special public schools that now provide ele\u00ad mentary and secondary education, but are not covered by the Act because they are operated by a State rather than a local edu\u00ad cational agency. The burden and effort test now required before emergency assistance can be author\u00ad ized would be eliminated. This change is necessary because most school districts do not have in their yearly budget funds to meet emergency disaster needs, and they cannot get such, funds until a new budget is approved for the following year. At present, the Office of Education cannot give assur\u00ad ance of Federal assis-tance when the disaster occurs and emergency repairs must be made; the change would permit authorizing emer\u00ad gency aid when needed. A minimum amount of $1,000 or one-half of one percent of the agency's operBiting budget for the year Will be established for any disaster claim. This would avoid han\u00ad dling requests for ve-ry small amounts of money. The Commissioner of Education would be authorized to grant funds to a public agency in sufficient amount to house students who were in a private school which was destroyed by a disaster, if the private school is not to be rebuilt. Under present wording, this can be done only if there also is destruction of or damage to public schools; the amendment would permit granting such assistance to a public agency when a private school is de\u00ad stroyed and not to. be rebuilt, although no public school has been destroyed or damaged. Amendment to Public Law 874 The only amendment proposed to P.L. 874 is a. technical change in the definition of Federal property. This amendment is made necessary in order to remove any question as to the deductibility of other Federal pay\u00ad ments from the gross entitlement of school districts in those cases where the other Fed\u00ad 'eral payment is made because .of taxes on private improvements on land held in trust for' individual Indians or Indian tribes. Two recent court cases have ruled against making deductions in these cases. The amendment would prevent duplicate payments to some districts. [From the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare] HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1967 I. FACT SHEET: EXTENSION OF THE HIGHER E)) UCATION ACT OF 1965 . Background and need Passage of the Higher Education Act in the closing days of the first session of the 89th Congress marked the culmination of an un\u00ad precedented 'iegislative commitment to the goal of educational op-portunity for all Amer\u00ad icans. As President Johnson noted in sign\u00ad ing the Act into law on November 8, 1965, no less than two dozen education measures were enacted by Congres during 1965. This Act, one of the keysto~es of the 89th COngress, was characterized by the President as the key which unlocks a new door for the young peo\u00ad ple of America: \"the most important door that will ever open-the door to education.\" The past year and a half have proved the truth of this statement. Programs sup\u00ad ported by the Higher Education Act have touched the students and colleges--and, in\u00ad deed, citizens and their communities--in every State in this country. This is an age when we are calling on all the resources of this Nation to help develop the Nation. Only through total commitment and total involve\u00ad ment can we assure equal educational oppor\u00ad tunity. The Higher Education Act forms _one of the bases for this commitment. Title I-This Title provides funds to in\u00ad stitutions of higher education to support ex\u00ad tension and continuing education programs designed to solve community problems and to meet the continuing educational needs of citizens whose formal education has been terminated or interrupted. Fifty years ago, when most Americans were engaged iii rural occupations, Congress responded to the chal\u00ad lenge by enacting the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, wllich made instruction, research, and extension services widely available through land-grant colleges. Today, when 70 percent of our population live in urban areas, TJ,tle I takes up the challenge of meeting the physi\u00ad cal and educational needs of a growing, shift\u00ad ing population. During fiscal year 1966, $9.2 million was allocated to the States in sup\u00ad port of community service programs. Over $3 million is being used for programs con\u00ad cerned with problems of government; over $1 millton for concerned with prob\u00ad lems of poverty; and over $1 million for pro\u00ad grams concerned with problems of health. Of the 539 programs being conducted by 301 institutions of higher ,education, 85 percent are directed toward the solution of urban and suburban problems ranging from recrea\u00ad tion to housing to employment to transporta\u00ad tion. In university-sponsored commu\u00ad nity service programs. Title 11-This program is designed to strengthen the heart of our Nation's colleges and universities-the library. Part A of Title II provided nearly $9 million in fiscal year 1966 to 1,830 institutions in every State. This money, in the form of basic grants to institutions of up to $5,000, was used for the purchase of books and periodicals, docu\u00ad ments, tapes, recordings, audiovisual and other library materials. It is estimated that the increase in library resources will reach 1.5 million volumes. Part B of the Title sup\u00ad ported 139 fellowships in library and infor\u00ad mation science in 24 colleges and universities 4756 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 during fiscal year 1966. Of the fellowships awarded, at a cost of $900,000, 52 were doc\u00ad toral fellowships and 87 were predoctoral. Part C transferred $300,000 to the Librarian of Congress, for the acquisition of library materials from all over the world and for their cataloging. In fiscal year 1967, a total of $31.75 million was appropriated for these activities. Title III-This unique program seeks to help those institutions of higher education that are isolated from the main currents of academic life. In fiscal year 1966, $5 mlllion was appropriated; 310 proposals submitted by 252 institutions in 46 States requested a total of $32 million. Projects supported provided for a wide variety of approaches to aid developing institutions; $4.3 milllon sup\u00ad ported cooperative arrangements between colleges, including na\u00ad tional teaching fellowships; $0.7 million was in the form of national teaching fellowships for which colleges applied individually. In fiscal year 1967, Title III received an appro\u00ad priation of $30 million. Proposals for fund\u00ad ing, seeking in excess of $52 million, received from 382 four-year institutions and 147 two\u00ad year institutions, are presently being con\u00ad sidered. Title IV-This Title has helped to pro\u00ad vide students attending colleges and uni\u00ad versities with a well-rounded package of stu\u00ad dent financial assistance opportunities. Edu\u00ad cational opportunity grants, combined with low-interest insured loans and college work\u00ad study programs, have had a major impact in alleviating the financial burden of attend\u00ad ing college. During fiscal year 1966, $58 mil\u00ad lion was appropriated for educational op\u00ad portunity grants for low-income youth. Grants were made to about 134,000 students in 1,420 institutions; the average grant amounted to $432. In fiscal year 1967, t4e $112 million appropriated is expected to aid 225,000 students in 1,700 institutions. Dur\u00ad ing fiscal year 1966, 133 proposals were re\u00ad ceived and 42 contracts were concluded under Part A of Title IV to carry out the educa\u00ad tional talent search program; in fiscal year 1967, 13 contracts have already been con\u00ad cluded. Part B of the Title authorized low\u00ad interest insured loans. During fiscal year 1966 interim agreements were signed with 12 State guarantee agencies; 8 state agencies commenced operations under permanent agreements; and the United Student Aid Fund had begun to participate in the pro\u00ad gram under permanent agreement in 18 Sta.tes. From the passage of the Act in No\u00ad vember 1965 through the end of Ootober 1966, the volume of loans exceeded $223 million, and the estimated number of borrowers ex\u00ad ceeded 174,000. Part C of the Title trans\u00ad ferred the college work study program from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Of\u00ad fice of Educaltion. During fiscal year 1966, $99 m1llion was appropriated, allowing over 190,- 000 students to receive work-study earnings at over 1,500 institutions. A total of $291.6 mlllion was appropriated for these student assistance programs in fiscal year 1967. Title V-This Title provided for a variety of teacher training and preparation programs. For fiscal year 1966, $9.5 milllon was appro\u00ad priated for the National Teacher Corps, which allows corpsmen to study for a master's degree at the same time they serve as teach\u00ad er-trainee under the supervision of expe\u00ad rienced teachers, in impoverished school dis\u00ad tricts across the country. An additional $15 million was appropriated for fellowships for experienced and prospective teachers. A to\u00ad tal of 1,530 prospective teacher fellowships were awarded to 169 institutions throughout the United States; another 1,004 fellowships were granted to experienced teachers seeking to improve and upda.te their skills. Institu\u00ad tional assistance grants, designed to strengthen curricula in teacher education, were awarded to 123 institutions in 46 States and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 1967, $7.5 million was appropriated for Teacher Corps, $25 million for experienced and prospective teacher fellowships, and $5 million for strengthening programs \u00b7 in teacher educa\u00ad tion. Title VI-Title VI is directed toward im\u00ad provement of undergraduate instruction. Fifteen million dollars was appropriated for fiscal year 1966, of which $1.5 million was available for the acquisition of television equipment and for minor remodeling of col\u00ad lege facilities. A total of 1,125 applications for assistance in the purchase of instruc\u00ad tional equipment were received by State commissions, and grant agreements were executed for 896 projects. In fiscal year 1967, $17 million was appropriated for ac\u00ad quisition of equipment and for media institutes. Most titles of the Higher Education Act expire at the end of fiscal year 1968. How\u00ad ever, in the past our Nation's schools and colleges have often been handicaped in their program planning by the Federal Govern\u00ad ment's timetable for both authorization and appropriations measures. Early extension of the Act would allow schools and colleges more ample lead-time for educational, fiscal, and manpower planning. Proposal Title I would be extended five years through fiscal year 1973. Matching at the rate of 75 percent Federal and 25 percent non-Federal share would be continued through fiscal year 1969. Not to exceed ten percent of sums appropriated would be set aside for support of experimental or pilot projects. For fiscal year 1968, $16.5 million is being requested to be appropriated. Parts A and B of title II would be extended five years through fiscal year 1973; Part C would be extended one year through fiscal year 1969. Part A, library resources, would be amended to liberalize the matching pro\u00ad vision for special purpose grants. Planning and development grants to encourage the opening of new library and information science schools would be authorized under Part B. For fiscal year 1968, $37.25 million is being requested to be appropriated. Title m would be extended five years through fiscal year 1973. For fiscal year 1968, $30 million is being requested to be appropriated. Title IV would be extended five years through fiscal year 1973. Work-study as\u00ad sistance would be counted as institutional contributions in satisfying matching re\u00ad quirements for educational opportunity grants. Repayment of insured loans would be authorized to be deferred under State or nonprofit private student loan insura.nce programs while a student is attending an in\u00ad stitution of higher education or is in mili\u00ad tary, Peace Corps, or VISTA service. This deferment is already provided under the Federal program. Under either program the Federal Government would pay all in\u00ad terest during this period of deferment. The maximum annual authorized loan, both under the Federally insured program and the State or privately insured programs would be set at $1500. A student would be permitted to enroll in summer classes if em\u00ad ployed full time under the work-study pro\u00ad gram. Maintenance of effort provisions in the work-study program would be liberal\u00ad ized, and proprietary institutions would be eligible to participate. The Federal match\u00ad ing share in the work-study program, which is scheduled to drop from 90 to 75 percent, would be held at 80 percent. To stimulate and encourage college-level programs of co\u00ad operative education-alternate periods of work and study-administrative expenses incurred in the operation of such programs would be eligible for payment from work\u00ad study funds. For fiscal year 1968, $339.5 million is being requested to be appro\u00ad priated. Title V's teacher fellowship programs would be incorporated into Title V of the Higher Education Amendments of 1967- Eaucation Professions Development. Title VI would be extended five years through fiscal year 1973. Subject matter limitations would be eliminated, and the program would be extended to graduate in\u00ad struction. For fiscal year 1968, $17 million is being requested to be appropriated. The Higher Education Faclllties Act; would be amended by extending the pro\u00ad visions for assistance in case of a major dis\u00ad aster and by fixing interest rates for loans at the current average market yield of com\u00ad parable United States obligations less a re\u00ad duction of not more than one percentage point to be set by the Comissioner of Education. II. FACT SHEET: EXTENSION OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE EDUCATION ACT OF 1958 Background and need When the National Defense Education Act; was enacted in 1958, President Johnson, then one of its authors in the Senate, commented that \"History may well record that we saved liberty and saved freedom when we under\u00ad took a crash program in the field of educa\u00ad tion.\" In the last 8 years, programs con\u00ad ducted under the NDEA have gone far to bear out this prophecy. The National Defense Education Act was signed into law September 2, 1958, during the period of national uneasiness that fol\u00ad lowed launching of the Soviet Sputnik. The legislation had the immediate aim of aug\u00ad menting the supply of highly trained man\u00ad power in fields relating to security-science. mathematios, and foreign languages. In succeeding years the Act has had in\u00ad creasing impact on the quality and avail\u00ad ability of American education. It has been amended from time to time-most recently by the Higher Education Amendments of 1966--to extend its coverage to virtually all areas of educa.tion. Students at all levels of education benefit from its provisions. Enacted originally for a 4 year period, the NDEA was extended in 1962 for two years. In 1964, the Congress provided a further extension, through fiscal year 1968. Since the Act's enactment, Congress has appropri\u00ad ated nearly $2.4 billion for NDEA activities; the appropriation for fiscal year 1967 is. $446,357,000. Title II-This program of financial assist\u00ad ance to students in the form of loans is prob\u00ad ably the best known portion of the Act. As originally enacted, loans were to be made to full-time students in institutions of higher education, with preference to those major\u00ad ing in science, mathematics, and modern for\u00ad eign languages. Forgiveness of a percentage of the loan amount and interest was afforded to teachers in public elementary and second\u00ad ary schools. This title has been substan\u00ad tially broadened in the ensuing years. Part\u00ad time students are now eligible to borrow; for\u00ad giveness has been extended to teachers in nonprofit private elementary and secondary schools and in institutions of higher educa\u00ad tion and to teachers of handicapped chil\u00ad dren; preference is now given to students with superior records in any field. It is estimated that more than $1 billion has been advanced to student borrowers, with the aver\u00ad age loan amounting to a little more than $600. For fiscal year 1967, $190 million was appropriated for contributions to student loan funds, $2 million for loans to educa\u00ad tional institutions, and $1.15 million for cancellation of student loans. Title III-Title III is designed to strengthen instruction in critical subjects: science, mathematics, modern foreign lan\u00ad guages, history, civics, geography, economics, English, reading, and (as added in 1966 amendments) industrial arts. Grants are available for public elementary and second\u00ad ary schools, and ~oans are made to nonprofit private elementary and secondary schools. The appropriation for these purposes for fis\u00ad cal year 1967 totaled $80.7 million, with an February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4757 additional $7.5 million for grants to States for supervision and administration of the program. State and local matching of Fed\u00ad eral funds on a 50-50 basis assures a greater expenditure for critically needed equipment; in fiscal year 1966 a total of $159 million was spent by the States under title III for acqui\u00ad sition of equipment and concomitant minor remodeling. A random sample of approved projects showed that approximately 58 per\u00ad cent of the funds were used for equipment and 42 percent for instructional materials. Audiovisual equipment and materials ac\u00ad counted for 38 percent of the acquisition projects. In fiscal year 1967, $79.2 milllon was appropriated for grants. For each of the last two fiscal years the appropriation for loans has been $1.5 million. The availab111ty of funds for loans has taken on increased importance during ~he past year because of the unavailability of com\u00ad mercial credit. In fiscal year 1966, 37 loans were made to 35 schools in 20 States, serving nearly 18,000 students. Title IV-The Graduate Fellowship Pro\u00ad gram, administered under title IV, has a dual purpose: to increase the number of well\u00ad qualified college and university teachers and to develop and expand the capacity of doc\u00ad toral study facilities throughout the country. The need for college and university teachers is acute. Enrollments in institutions of higher education are expected to expand from 5 million in 1964 to 9 milllon in 1975. It is estimated that approximately 610,000 new full-time-equivalent professional staff members will be needed to meet these de\u00ad mands, but projections indicate that only 230,000 doctorates wm be produced by 1975, and no more than half of these can be ex\u00ad pected to go into college teaching. As orig\u00ad inally enacted, title IV authorized 1,000 grad\u00ad uate fellowships. Amendments passed in 1964 authorized a 100 percent increase in the number of fellowships for fiscal year 1965, a 400 percent increase for fiscal year 1966, and a 500 percent increase for fiscal year 1967. Beginning with the 1967-68 academic year, more than 90 percent (193) of all institutions authorized to award the doctorate will have active title IV fellowship programs. Approxi\u00ad mately $82 million will be obligated during fiscal year 1967 to cover the cost of 6,000 new graduate fellowships plus some 9,000 awards continuing from previous years. Title V-Part .A of title V supports pro\u00ad grams in guidance, counseling, and testing and identification and encouragement of able students . Its purpose is to assist in estab\u00ad lishing and maintaining programs of guid\u00ad ance, counseling, and testing in elementary and secondary schools and junior colleges and technical institutes. Appropriations for this activity have risen from $7.4 million in fiscal year 1959 to $24.5 milllon in fiscal year 1967. During the past year the 54 States and territories participating in the program gave more than 9 million aptitude and achieve\u00ad ment tests to public school students and 370,000 to students in nonpubllc schools. Under Office of Education contracts, testing agencies administered 210,300 tests to more than 179,500 nonpublic school students in 37 States, the District of Columbia, and Guam. In addition, the number of full-time counselors for secondary school students in public schools was increased to 1 counselor to every 460 students, a striking improvement over the 1 to 960 ratio for fiscal year 1959. Part B of title V authorizes institutes for persons who are working or planning to work in counseling and guidance. Forty colleges and universities w111 conduct 42 institutes during the summer of 1967 and the 1967-68 school year for approximately 1,200 persons, 850 of whom will be elementary and high school counselors. Since 1959, more than 21,000 counselors have participated in guid\u00ad ance and counseling institutes. For fiscal year 1967, $31.750 million was appropriated for activities under Title V. Title VI-A critical need for specialists in foreign languages and countries existed in 1959, when the first fellowships were awarded under Title VI of NDEA. Eight years and 7,000 fellowships later, the need stlll exists. Next summer and during the 1967-68 school year, 1,600 additional gradu\u00ad ate students will receive intensive training in 92 foreign languages and related studies such as geography, history, and anthro\u00ad pology. The training will be provided by 52 colleges and universities in 27 States and the District of Columbia. About $6 million will be expended to finance these studies. An additional $550,000 wm be allocated to 19 universities for undergraduate modern for\u00ad eign language stipends, as authorized by Title VI. Approximately 550 stipends will be awarded to qualified undergraduate stu\u00ad dents, who will be enrolled in 22 NDEA\u00ad supported Language and Area Studies pro\u00ad grams during the summer of 1967. In fiscal year 1966, 98 Language and Area Centers were established at 61 institutions under Title VI. These Centers focused on 79 different modern foreign languages rarely taught in the United States. Over $5 mil\u00ad lion was obligated in support of these Cen\u00ad ters. For fiscal year 1967, $15.8 million was appropriated. Title VII-The research program author\u00ad ized by Title VII provides the means for adapting such communication media ai television, motion pictures, radio, and pro\u00ad grammed self-instruction to the improve\u00ad ment of education in our schools. Since fiscal year 1959, over $33 million has been obligated for research and dissemination ac\u00ad tivities. Part A of Title VII provides sup\u00ad port for research and experimentation and evaluation of projects involving television, motion pictures, radio, printed and pub\u00ad lished materials, and related communication media for educational purposes. Since 1959, approximately' 375 projects have received support in institutions throughout most of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Some 215 of these have been completed. Title VII also provides, through Part B, sup\u00ad port for project activities involving the dis\u00ad semination of informa.tion about new edu\u00ad cational media and their ut111zation. Such activities may take the form of studies and surveys, demonstrations, and publications or reports. Since 1959, 253 projects have bee_n initiated under Part B; 195 have been completed. For fiscal year 1967, $4.4 million was appropriated. Title VIII-This title authorizes area voca\u00ad tional educational programs; it was enacted as title III of the George-Barden Act of 1946. The technical education program was made a permanent program by the Vocational Education Act of 1963, with an authorization of $15 million a year for the training of highly skilled technicians for occupations requiring scientific knowledg~lectronics, drafting and design, instrumentation, indus\u00ad trial chemistry, and other technical occu\u00ad pations. Title IX-Title IX establishes a Science Information Service to coordinate and im\u00ad prove methods of disseminaJting information in the sciences. This activity is carried out by the National Science Foundation. Title X-NDEA provides grants to State Education agencies to improve the adequacy and reliab111ty of educational statistics and the methods for collecting, processing, and disseminating such data. For fiscal year 1967, $2.25 million was appropriated for th_ese purposes. Title XI-A new title, Training Institutes, was established by the 1964 amendments. As enacted, it authorized institutes in modern foreign languages and English taught as a second language, but also expanded the pro\u00ad gram to include a. selected range of vital fields--English, reading, history, geography, disadvantaged youth, and educational media specialists. Amendments contained in the Higher Education Act of 1965 added eco\u00ad nomics, civics, and industrial arts to the areas of specialization. By amendment in the International Education Act of 1966 in\u00ad stitutes were authorized in the field of inter\u00ad national affairs. For fiscal year 1967, $30 mil\u00ad lion was appropriated for the institute pro- gram. Proposal The National Defense Education Act does not expire until the end of fiscal year 1968. However, in the past our Nation's schools and colleges have often been handicapped in their program planning by the Federal Govern\u00ad ment's timetable for both authorization and appropriation measures. Early extension of the Act would allow schools and colleges more ample leadtime for educational, fiscal, and manpower planning. Title II would be extended five years through fiscal year 1973. The loan cancel\u00ad lation benefits would be extended to teachers in programs of special education or train\u00ad ing designed to combat disadvantage, pov\u00ad erty, or unemployment. In addition, non\u00ad Federal capital for National Defense Student Loans would be encouraged by establishing a revolving fund from which institutions may obtain loans to capitalize fully addi\u00ad tional student loan funds. This would make more funds available to students to finance their undergraduate and graduate educa\u00ad tions. An appropriation of $195.4 million is being requested for fiscal year 1968. Title m would be extended 5 years through fiscal year 1973. Subject limitations would be eliminated, and Section 12 of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act would be merged with title m. In in\u00ad stances where States impose requirements for financial participation of project appli\u00ad cants, within-State equalization would be encouraged. State administrative expenses would be paid out of project funds. The loan allotment formula for private schools would be repealed, and loans would be au\u00ad thorized to American-sponsored .schools serv\u00ad ing American children abroad. An appropri\u00ad ation of $50 m1llion is being requested for fiscal year 1968. Title IV would be extended 5 years through fiscal year 1973. The maximum length of fellowship would be extended from 3 to 4 years in special circumstances, and stipends would be set in amounts consistent with those awarded for comparable fellowships. An appropriation of $96.6 million 1s being re\u00ad quested for fiscal year 1968. T1 tie V-A would be extended 5 years through fiscal year 1973. Title V-B expires at the end of fiscal year 1968. Its extension is not being requested as it would be incor\u00ad porated in title V of the Higher Education Amendments of 1967-Education Professions Development. An appropriation of $31.75 mill1on is being requested for fiscal year 1968. Title VI would be extended one year thi-ough fiscal year 1969. Title VII expires at the end of fiscal year 1968. Its extension is not being requested since activities can be funded under the Cooperative Research. Title VIII is incorporated into the Voca\u00ad tional Education Act of 1963. No amend\u00ad ments are proposed. Title IX is the responsib111ty _ of the Na\u00ad tional Science Foundation. No amendments are proposed. Title X (Improvement of Statistical Serv\u00ad ices of State Educational Agencies) expires at the end of fiscal year 1968. Its extension is not being requested, as its function has been superseded by title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Pro\u00ad vision is made in NDEA for the participation of the pust Territory of the Pacific Islands, for schools of the Department of the Inte\u00ad rior for Indian children, and for overseas dependents schools of the Department of De\u00ad fense. Title XI expires at the end of fiscal year 4758 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 1968. Its extension is not being requested, as it will be incorporated into title V of the Higher Education Amendments of 1967-Edu\u00ad cation Professions Development. An appro\u00ad priation of $35.5 mi111on is being requested for fiscal year 1968. III. FACT SHEET: EDUCATION PROFESSIONS DEVELOPMENT Background and need Education, our Nation's second-largest en\u00ad terprise, has acute staffing problems. In the fall of 1965, more than 200,000 teachers were hired, filling vacancies left by turnover, re\u00ad placing uncertified teachers, and meeting needs caused by increased student enroll\u00ad ment. Yet the critical need for teachers con\u00ad tinues and, a\u00b7ccording to a nationwide study, is more acute this school year than it was a year ago. Total enrollments in public elementary and secondary schools reached a new peak of 43 million last fall. To meet the demand 'for teachers, to reduce class size, to replace teachers leaving their positions, and to elim\u00ad inate the number of teachers not having adequate training, 169,000 additional teach\u00ad ers are currently needed. Today, more than 5 percent of. our schools' teaching force-\u00ad approximately 90,50Q \u00b7 full-time teachers\u00ad do not meet their State's certification stand\u00ad ards. Properly qualified teachers must be employed if our country's children are to achieve their full educational development. Many Federal programs currently are di\u00ad rected toward attracting promising personnel into the field of education and toward up\u00ad dating the sk111s of those already in the class\u00ad room. Last year, nearly 300 different programs supporttng 2,534 fellowships were awarded grants under the Teacher Fellowship Pro\u00ad gram authorized by-Title V-C of the Higher Education Act of 1965. This year, 18,000 teachers w111 be trained in 493 institutes in 272 colleges under Title XI of the National Defense Education Act of 1958. Currently, 10,350 NDEA feilows are study\u00ad ing for their doctorates on American campuses, prior \u00b7to entering the field of col- lege teaching. . This year, approximately 1,200 persons who are working or planning to work in co:unsel\u00ad ing and g\\lidance w111 attend 42 institutes conducted by 40 colleges under Title V-B of the National Defense Education Act of 1958. Yet current-Federal programs are handi\u00ad capped by gaps in legi.slative authority and by the lack of flexibility which inhibits the development of a variety of programs needed to meet the changing manpower require\u00ad ments of our schools and colleges. The Office of Education can support: Training of certain school-related per\u00ad sonnel but not \u00b7 others, for example. sub\u00ad professionals, school business managers, school board members; _ ' Institutes in certain subject areas but not in others, for example, psychology, anthro\u00ad pology, sociology, business education, physi\u00ad ca~ education; Fellowships for certain professionals but not others, for example, junior college teach\u00ad ers, university administrators. Proposal Effective July 1, 1969, the Education Pro\u00ad fessions Development Act, as a part of the proposed Higher Education Amendments of 1967, would bring greater order out o:r the present patchwork of\u00b7 educational training legislation through flexible authority allow\u00ad ing the coordination, broadening, and strengthening of programs for the training of teachers and other education personnel for all levels of education. The Commissioner of Education would be required t9 appraise the Nation's existing and future personnel needs in education and the adequacy of the Nation's efforts to meet these needs, from preschool to university, and to publish an annual report on the state of the education professions. In developing this information, he would consult with the Department of Labor, the National . Science Foundation, and the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities. Grants would be made to State and local educational agencies and to institutions of higher education, to enable them to identify and encourage . qualified persons to enter or reenter the field of education. Fellowships under Title V-C of the Higher Education Act of 1965 would be expanded to include pre\u00ad school and adult and vocational education personnel. In the .field 9f training for careers .in el~\u00ad mentary, secondary, and post-secondary edu\u00ad cation, program development grants in\u00ad stitutions of higher education would be of\u00ad fered to strengthen graduate and undergrad\u00ad uate programs, including those for non\u00ad teaching personnel. Grants would also be made to institutions of higher education and to State and local educational agencies for preservice and inservice training, including institutes, seminars, and workshops for per\u00ad sonnel in all subject matter areas. In the field of training for careers in higher education, a special program of grants would support programs or projects designed for persons planning to teach or undertake other educational responsibilities in institu\u00ad tions of higher education. A National Advisory Council on Educa\u00ad ti<;m Professions Development would be es\u00ad tablished upon enactment of the Act, to re\u00ad view this title and all other Federal programs for the training and development of educa\u00ad tional personnel. The Council would make annual reports of its findings and recom\u00ad mendations. IV, FACT SHEET: EXTENSION OF THE NATIONAL VOCATIONAL STUDENT LOAN IN&URANCE ACT OF 1965 Background and need The National Vocational Student Loan In\u00ad surance Act of 1965 is designed to make it possible for students to borrow money for education and training in schools of busi\u00ad ness, trade, technology, and other vocational fields. The Act provides the means for stu\u00ad dents to obtain insured loans from private commercial and other eligible lenders, with the Federal Government paying a part of the interest on behalf of qualified students. For a student to obtain a vocational stu\u00ad dent loan, he must attend or be accepted for enrollment in an eligible schol>l. There are no age limitations. The student need not be a high school graduate, or even ari ele\u00ad mentary school graduate, but he must be considered able to ben~fl.t from the program in which he is enrolled. Eligible vocational schools must meet several criteria: They must admit only those students who have the ab111ty to benefit from the training; They must be legally authorized to provide a program of post-secondary education which trains for useful employment in recognized occupations; They must have been in existence for at least two years; and They must have been accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Com\u00ad missioner of Education or have been specially approved by the Commissioner. Banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, insurance companies, and similar institutions subject to supervision by the State or Federal Government are eligible to become lenders. Eligible vocational schools may also qualify to become lenders. Programs vary from State to State, depend\u00ad ing on the regulations of the insurance agency. For a student whose adjusted fami\u00ad ly income is less than $15,000 per year, the Federal Government will pay interest up to 6 percent a year on the unpaid principal balance of his loan while the 'student is in school, and 3 percent interest on the unpaid principal balance during the repayment period. The National Vocational Student Loan Program is '!Jllprecedented in the field of vocational and trade school education. The response has been outstanding. Although the program is quite new, 14 States already have operative loan programs, conducted either by State agencies or by private non\u00ad profit insuring agencies. Approximately 3,500 vocational schools have been approved as \"eligible schools.\" It is estimated that. by the end of 1968, approximately 173,000 students Will have received vocational stu\u00ad dent loans, totallll;tg $872 m1111on. Proposal The present Act provides that, after fiscal year 1968, the Federal Government can insure loans only for students who have received prior insured loans under the Act. The amendment Will provide insurance for loans made to new borrowers until June 30, 1973, and for additional loans made to borrowers prior to that date to continue their educa\u00ad tion until June 30, 1977. Section 6 of the National Vocationru Stu\u00ad dent Loan Insurance Act Will be amended so that, under the Federal loan insurance pro\u00ad gram, the maximum loan amount per aca\u00ad demic year shall be $1,500 and the aggregate loans to any student shall not exceed $3,000. Section 9(b) of the Act Will be amended to provide that, in the case of State and private programs, loans shall be insured up to a. maximum of $1,500 for any academic year or its equivalent and up to an aggregate of $3,000 of loans outstanding to any student. At present, insurance agencies are free to establish any maximum amounts over $1,000 they desire. The amendments Will make the Federal and non-Federal programs co\u00ad ordinate. These amendments wm make uniform the maximum amounts a student can borrow under the National Vocational Student Loan Insurance Act, whether guaranteed by a. State or private agency or insured by the Federal Government. The total of the payments by a borrower during any year of any repayment period, *tth respect to the aggregate amount of all loans to that borrower which are insured under this Act, shall not be less than $360 or the balance of such loans plus interest, whichever is less. At present, the Act indi\u00ad cates no minimum payment under State or private nonprofit guarantee agencies; under the Federal insured loan program, repay\u00ad ments must be made as specified in the amendment. The amendment w111 require a borrower under a State or private guarantee agency program to make the same minimum payment as in the Federal program. \u00b7 Repayment ' of insured loans would be au\u00ad thorized to be deferred under ~tate or pri\u00ad vate loan insurance programs while a student is attending an institution of higher educa\u00ad tion O:i.' is in m111tary, Peace Corps, or VISTA service. This deferment is already provided under the Fe(ieral program. Under either program the Federal Government would pay all of the interest during this period of deferment. The excerpts from the President's message, presented by Mr. MORSE, are as follows: \u00b7 ExCERPTS FROM THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE ON EDUCATION AND HEALTH IN AMERICA In Edmonds, Washington, three new eve\u00ad ning classes today are helping 150 high sohool dropouts finish school and gain new job skills. In Detroit, a month ago, 52,000 children were immunized against measles, during a. campaign assisted by Federal funds. In 25 States, Federal funds are helping im\u00ad prove medical care for 6.4 mill1on citizens who get public assistance. February 28, 196.7 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4759 Over 8 m1111on poor children are now get\u00ad ting a better education because of funds pro\u00ad vided under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Nineteen million older citizens enjoy the protection of Medi\u00ad care. Three years ago, not one of these programs existed. Today, they are flourishing-because a concerned people and the creative 89th Con\u00ad gress acted. Th.ey are the result of twenty\u00ad four new health laws and eighteen new edu\u00ad cation laws. But even the best new programs are not enough. ' Today, we face major challenges of organi\u00ad zation and evaluation. If our new projects are to be effective, we must have the people to run them, and the facilities to support them. We must encourage states and localities to plan more effectively and comprehensively for their growing needs and to measure their progress towards meeting those needs. Above all, each community, each state, must generate a spirit of creative change: a w1llingness to experiment. In this, my fourth message to Congress on Health and Education, I do not recommend more of the same-but more that is better: to solve old problems, to create new institu\u00ad tions, to fulfill the potential of each indi\u00ad vidual in our land. Nothing is more fundamental to all we seek than. out\"' programs in health and e~u- cation: ,, Education-because it not only overcomes ignorance, but arms the citizen agail;l8t the other evils which afflict him. Health-because disease is the cruelest enemy of individual promise and because medical progress makes less and less toler\u00ad able that illness still should blight so many lives. I. EDUCATION I believe that future historians, when they point to the extraordinary changes which have marked the 1960's, will identify a major movement forward in American education. This movement, spurred by the laws of the last three years, seeks to provide equality of educational opportunity to all Americans-\u00ad to give every child education of the highest quality, no matter how poor his family, how great his handicap, what color his skin, or where he 11 ves. We cannot yet fully measure the results of this great' movement in Am~rlcan educa\u00ad tion. Our progress can be traced partially by listing some of the extraordinary bills I have signed into law: The Higher Education Act of 1965. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1964. The Higher Education Fac111ties Act of 1963. The Vocational Education Act of 1963. The scale of our efforts\u00b7 can be partially measured by the fact that today appropria\u00ad tions for the Office of Education are nearly seven times greater than four years ago. To\u00ad day we can point to at least one m1llion col\u00ad lege students who might not be in college except for government loans, grants and work-study programs, and to more than 17,500 school dtstri'cts helping disadvantaged children under the Elementary and Second\u00ad ary Education Act. This breakthrough is not the work of Wash-: ington alone. The ideas for these programs come from educational leaders all over the country. Many different communities must supply the energy to make these programs work. Yet they are national programs, shaped by national needs. Congress has played a. vital role in reviewing these needs and setting these priorities. . The new Fede~al role in education is, in reality, a new allianc~ with America's states and local communities. In this alliance, the Federal Government continues to be a junior panner: Local school districts will submit, and state governments will approve, the plans for spending more than one billion dollars this year to improve the education of poor chil\u00ad dren. Federal funds for vocational education are administered through state plans con\u00ad trolled by state, not Federal, officials. The recommendations of the states have been sought and followed in more than 95 percent of th~ projects for centers and serv\u00ad ices which are funded by the U.S. Office of Education. The education programs I recommend this year have three major aims: To strengthen the foundations we have laid in recent years, by revising, improving : and consolidating existing programs. To provide special help to those groups in our society with special needs; the poor, the handicapped, victims of discrimination or neglect. To build for the future by exploiting the new opportunities presented by science, technology and the world beyond our bor\u00ad ders. The budget proposals I am making for 1968 will carry forward our efforts at a new level. The total Federal dollar expenditures for educational purposes, including health training, which I have proposed for Fiscal 1968 will amount to $11 b1llion-an increase of $1 blllion, or 10 percent, over 1967 and $7 billion, or 175 percent, over 1963. Strengthening education programs State and community education leaders have shoUldered heavy new burdens as a re\u00ad sult of recent increases in Federal programs . If these officials are to develop wise and long-range plans for education, they must have more help. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has provided funds to strengthen state departments of education. But additional funds' are needed-money to improve com\u00ad munity, state, and regional educational plan\u00ad rung. Nothing can do more to ensure the effective use of Federal dollars. I recommend legislation authorizing $15 million to help state and local governments evaluate their education programs and plan for the future. A better education timetable One condition which severely hampers educational planning \u00b7is the Congressional schedule for authorizations and appropria\u00ad tions. When Congress enacts a:rad funds programs near the end of a session, the Na\u00ad tion's schools and colleges must plan their programs without knowing what Federal re\u00ad sources will be available to them to meet their needs. As so many Governors have said, the Federal legislative calendar often proves incompatible with the academic cal\u00ad endar. I urge that the Congress enact education appropriations early enough tq allow the Nation's schools and colleges to plan effec\u00ad tively. I have directed the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to work with the Congress towa~d this end. . ' Another way to ease this-problem is to seek the earliest practical renewal of authoriza:. tion for major education measures. I recommend \u00b7that Congress this year ex\u00ad tend three major education measures now scheduled to expire in June 1968: -The National Defense Education Act of 1958. The Higher Education Act of 1965. The National Vocational Student Loan In\u00ad surance Act of 1965 .. Improving Program Evaulat~on Most of our education programs have been operating too short a time to provide con\u00ad clusive judgments about their effectiveness. But we should be heartened by the evalua\u00ad tions so far. Recently, the National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children re\u00ad ported: \"The morale of teachers and administra\u00ad tors in schools with many poor children\u00ad their will to succeed and their belief in the possibility of succeeding-is perceptibly on the rise in many of the schools visited. More teachers than ever are involved in an active search for paths to success. The paths are not all clearly visible as yet, but decidedly the search has taken on a new vigor.\" The council did identify problems and weaknesses in the school districts. Our ef\u00ad forts to identify shortcomings and to assess our progress can never be fully effective un\u00ad til we provide sufficient resources for pro\u00ad gram evaluation. I have requested $2.5 million to assure careful analysis of new programs so that we can provide a full accounting to the Con\u00ad gress and the American people of our sue, cesses and shortcomings. The Education Professions Act of 1967 Our work to enrich education finds its focus in a single person: the classroom teacher, who inspires each student to achieve his best. Next year, more than 170,000 new teachers will be needed to replace uncertified teach\u00ad ers, to fill vacancies and to meet rising stu\u00ad dent enrollments. Moreover: There are severe shortages of English, Mathematics. Science and elementary school teachers. More teachers are needed for our colleges and junior colleges. Well trained administrators at all levels are critically needed. New kinds of school personnel-such as teachers aides--are needed to help fn the schools. By 1975, the nation's sc~ools wm need nearly two million more new teachers. rr:o help meet this growing demand, the Federal government has sponsored a number of programs to train and improve teachers. These programs, though they have been effectiye, have been too fragmented to achieve their full potential and too limited to reach many essential seqtor~ of the _teaching pro\u00ad fession. Teacher aides and school adminis\u00ad trators have not been eligible to participate. We must develop a broader approach to training for the education professions. At the state and local level, education author\u00ad ities !!lUSt have greater flexibility to plan for their educational manpower needs. I. recommend the Education Professions Act of 1967 to: _ Combine and expand many of the scat\u00ad tered statutory authorities for teacher train\u00ad ing assistance. Provide new authority for the training of school administrators , teacher aides, and other eaucation worker,s for schools and colleges. Improving Student Loan Programs In the Higher Education Act of 1965, Con\u00ad gress authorized a program to support state guarantees for student loans made by banks and other lending institutions. For students of modest means, the Federal Government also subsidizes the interest cost. The program has become an example of creative cooperation between the Federal Government, the states, private financial in\u00ad stitutions and\u00b7. the academic community. Though it began in a time of tight credit. the program is off to a promising start. This year, it is expected that loans totaling $400 million will be made \u00b7to n~arly 480,000 stu\u00ad dents. By 1972, outstanding loans are ex\u00ad pected to total $6.5 billion. I have asked all of the government officials concerned with the program-the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Sec\u00ad retary of the Treasury, the Director of the Budget, and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers--to review\u00b7tts operations in consultation with state and private orga- nizations concerned. \u00b7 \u00b7 If administrative changes in the program are necessary; we will make them. If any 4760 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 amendments to the legislation are in order, we will submit appropriate recommendations to the Congress. Special programs for special needs Educating Poor Children Over the past two years, we have invested more than $2.6 billion in improving educa\u00ad tional opportunities for more than ten mil\u00ad lion poor children. This has been an am\u00ad bitious venture, for no textbook offers precise methods for dealing with the disadvantaged. It has also been rewarding: we have gener\u00ad ated new energy, gained new workers and developed new skills in our effort to help the least fortunate. Dollars alone cannot do the Job-but the job cannot be done without dollars. So let us continue the programs we have begun under Head Start and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Let us begin new efforts-like the Head Start Follow Through program which can carry forward into the early grades the gains made under Head Start. The Teacher Corps Young as it is, the Teacher Corps has be\u00ad come a symbol of new hope for America's poor children and their parents-and for hard pressed school administrators. More than 1200 interns and veteran teach\u00ad ers have volunteered for demanding assign\u00ad ments in city and rural slums. Teacher Corps volunteers are at work in 275 schools throughout the country: helping children in 20 of our 25 largest cities, in Appalachia, ln the Ozarks, ln Spanish-speaking communi\u00ad ties. The impact of these specialists goes far beyond their number. For they represent an important idea: that the schools in our Na\u00ad tion's slums deserve a fair share of our Na\u00ad tion's best teachers. Mayors and school officials across the coun\u00ad try cite the competence, the energy, and the devotion which Teacher Corps members are bringing to these tasks. Perhaps the best measure of the vitality of the Teacher Corps is the demand by school districts for volunteers and the number of young Americans who want to join. Re\u00ad quests from local schools exceed by far the number of volunteers we can now train. Ten times as many young Americans as we can presently accept-among them, some. of our brightest college graduates-have applied for Teacher Corps service. The Teacher Corps, which I recommended and which the 89th Congress established, de\u00ad serves the strong support of the 90th Con\u00ad gress .. I recommend that the Teacher Corps be expanded to a total of 5,500 volunteers by the school year beginning in September 1968. I propose amendments to enhance the role of the states in training and assigning Teacher Corps members. Finally, to finance next summer's training program, I strongly recommend early action on a supplemental appropriation request oj $12.5 million for the Teacher Corps in fiscal year 1967. Educating the Handicapped One child in ten in our country is afHicted with a handicap which, if left untreated, severely cripples his chance to become a pro\u00ad ductive adult. In my Message on Children and Youth, I proposed measures to bring better health care to these children-the mentally re\u00ad tarded, the crippled, the chronically ill. We must also give attention to their special educational needs. We must more precisely identify the techniques that will be effective in helping handicapped childrep to learn. We need many more teachers who have the tmtning es,senti.aJ to help these children. There Me now only 70,000 specially trained teachers of the handicapped-a small frac\u00ad tion of the number the Nation requires. In the next decade, five times that number must be trained and put to work. I recommend legisation to: Establish regional resource centers to iden\u00ad tify the educational needs of handicapped children and help their parents and teachers meet those needs. Recruit more men and women for careers in educating the handicapped. Extend the service providing captioned films and other instructional materials for the deaf to all handicapped people. Endlng Discrimination Giving every American an equal chance for education requires that we put an end once and f.or all to racial segregation in our soh:ools. In the Civil Ri.ghts Act of 1964, this Na\u00ad tion committed itself to eliminating segre\u00ad gation. Yet patterns of disclrim.inlaJtion are still entrenched in many communities, North and South, East and West. If equal opportuni.ty is to be more than a slogam. in our society, every state and com\u00ad munity must be encouraged to face up to this legal and moral responsib111ty. I have \u00b7requested $30 million,-nearly a four-fold increase over this year's appropria\u00ad tiO'Tir-to provide the needed resources under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act to help states and communities face the problems of school desegregation. Education for the World of Work Three out of ten students in America drop out before completing high school. Only two out of ten of our Nation's young men and women receive college degrees. Too few of these young people get the training and guidance they need to find good jobs. , I recommend legislation to aid secondary schools and colleges to develop new programs in vocational education, to make 11XY1\"k part of the learning experience and to provide career-counseling for their students. A number of our colleges have highly suc\u00ad cessful programs of cooperative education which permit students to vary periods of study with periods of employment. This is an i.mportant educational innov1iltion that has demonstrated its effectiveness. It should be applied more widely in our schools and univers1ties. I recommend an amendment of the Col\u00ad lege Work-Study Program which will for the first time permit us to support cooperative education projects. I am also requesting the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Secretary of Labor to use Neighborhood Youth Corps funds at the high school level for this purpose. Combating Adult Illiteracy At least three million adults in America cannot read or write. Another 13 million have less than an eighth grade education. Many of these citizens lack the basic learn\u00ad ing to cope with the routine business of daily life. This is a national tragedy and an eco\u00ad nomic loss for which each one of us must pay. The Adult Education Act, enacted last year, is our pledge to help eliminate this needless loss of human talent. This year, I am requesting $44 million\u00ad an increase of nearly fifty percent-for adult basic education programs. These funds will help new projects, sponsored by both public agencies and non:. profit private groups, to train volunteers for work in adult literacy programs and to es\u00ad tablish neighborhood education programs reaching beyond the formal classroom. Instructional television I recommend legislation to authorize the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to launch a major study of the value and the promise of instructional television which is being used more and more widely in our classrooms, but whose potential has not been fully developed. Computers in education In my 1968 Budget, I propose that the Na\u00ad tional Science Foundation be given new re\u00ad sources to advance man's knowledge and serve the nation. Its endeavors will help our scholars better to understand the atmos\u00ad phere, exploit the ocean's riches, probe the behavior and the nature of man. ';I'he Foundation will also step up its pio\u00ad neer work to develop new teaching materials for our schools and colleges. The \"new math\" and the \"new science\" are only the first fruits of this innovative work. One educational resource holds exciting promise for America's classrooms: the elec\u00ad tronic computer. Computers are already at work in educational institutions, primarily to assist the most advanced research. The com\u00ad puter can serve other educational purposes\u00ad if we find ways to employ it effectively and economically and if we develop practical courses to teach students how to use it. I have directed the National Science Foun\u00ad dation working with the U.S. Office of Edu\u00ad cation to establish an experimental program for developing the potential of computers in education. Enriching the arts and the humanities Our progress will not be limited to sci\u00ad entific advances. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, established in 1965, has already begun to bring new cul\u00ad tural and scholarly spirit to our schools and communities. State arts councils, museums, theaters, and orchestras have received not only new funds but new energy and enthu\u00ad siasm through the National Endowment for the Arts. The National Endowment for the Humani\u00ad ties has made grants to support new histor\u00ad ical studies of our Nation's heritage, to encourage creative teaching in our col\u00ad leges, to offer outstanding young scholars opportunities for advancement. I recommend that Congress appropriate for the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities $16 milliO'Tir-an increase of near\u00ad ly one-third. Higher education for international under\u00ad standing For many years, America's colleges and universities have prepared men and women for careers involving travel, trade and serv\u00ad ice abroad. Today, when our world respon\u00ad sibi11ties are greater than ever before, our domestic institutions of higher learning need more support for their programs of interna\u00ad tional studies. The 89th Congress, in its closing days, passed the International Education Act\u00ad an historic measure recognizing this Nation's enduring belief that learning must transcend geographic boundaries. Through a program of grants under the Act, America's schools, colleges, and universities can add a world dimension to their students' learning experi\u00ad ence. I urge the Congress to approve promptly my forthcoming request for a supplemental appropriation of $350,000 for the Interna\u00ad tional Education Act, to permit necessary planning for next year's program, as well as an appropriation of $20 million for fiscal 1968. III. TO FULFILL THE INDIVIDUAL As a people, we have wanted many things, achieved many things. We have become the richest, the mightiest, the most productive nation in the world . Yet a nation may accumu~ate dollars, grow in power, pile stone on stone--and still fall short of greatness. The measure of a people is not how much they achieve--but .what they achieve. February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4761 Which of our pursuits is most worthy of our devotion? If we were required to choose, I believe we would place one item at the top of the list: fulfillment of the individual. If that is what we seek, mere wealth and power cannot help us. We must also act-\u00ad in definable and practical ways-to liberate each individual from conditions which stunt his growth, assault his dignity, diminish his spirit. Those enemies we know: ignorance, illness, want, squalor, tyranny, injustice. To fulfill the individual-this is the pur\u00ad pose of my proposals. They present an op\u00ad _portunity-and an obligation-to the Nine\u00ad tieth Congress. I hope and believe this Congress will live up to the high expectations of a progressive \u00b7and humanitarian America. LYNDON B. JOHNSON. THE WHITE HousE, February 28, 1967. TEACHER CORPS SUCCESS IN MILWAUKEE Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, the Sen\u00ad ate will soon be asked to consider the supplemental budget request for the Na\u00ad tional Teacher Corps. President John\u00ad son has also recommended that the Teacher Corps be tripled in size during the coming fiscal year. During its first year of operation the Tea-cher Corps has been tremendously successful. The enthusiasm and dedica\u00ad tion of the Teacher Corps interns has had a pronounced impact on the children in the inner city and poor rural school districts. A team of teacher corpsmen serving in Rufus King High School in Milwaukee has worked extensively with students who have been multiple failures, failing 'three or more of their academic subjects. After only a few months of work with these children on a 1-to-1 basis, over 50 percent of the students showed aca\u00ad demic improvement, and attendance and disciplinary problems dropped. A committee headed by Dr. Harvey Goldman, director of the Wisconsin Teacher Corps, and Mr. John Powers, principal of Rufus King High School, has submitted a report on the work of this team of corpsmen which will show Sen\u00ad ators what the Teacher Corps can ac\u00ad complish. r-ask unanimous consent that there\u00ad port be inserted at this point in the RECORD. There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: ~STUDY OF MULTIPLE FAILURES: A REPORT OF A SociAL WELFARE FIELD PROJECT CONDUCTED BY THE NATIONAL TEACHER CORPS TEAM AT RUFUS KING HIGH SCHOOL, MILWAUKEE, WIS. (Submitted by Dr. Harvey Goldman, director, National Teacher Corps at Milwaukee; Mr. John A. Powers, principal; Mr. Jerald' A. Hauser, intern; Mr. Donald Sorauf, team leader; Mr. William Ware, intern; Miss Patricia Wiser, intern) I. THE PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF MULTIPLE FAILURES WITHIN THE RUFUS KING HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT During the Pre-Service (summer) session of the National Teacher Corps the team lead\u00ad er and interns at Rufus King High School sought to study those students classified as multiple failures during the previous year. A multiple failure, as defined here, is one who falled at least three academic subjects the previous semester, who appeared to be a potential dropout, and who had manifested disciplinary patterns which were not in keep\u00ad ing with that which was expected from them. The team members were hopeful that such a study would enable them to derive nu\u00ad merous insights into the nature of students' attitudes toward school, into the home situa\u00ad tions which apparently fostered such at- titudes, and into the relationships which existed between such students and the various school authorities. A study of the school records of the ninety\u00ad two multiple failures mentioned above in\u00ad dicated the following: (1f approximately 62% were born and raised in Milwaukee; (2) the fam111es of such multiple failures were relatively large, averaging 5.4 children per famlly; (3) multiple failures within the school had not previously received aid which might enable them to compensate for their academic inadequacies; (4) multiple failures rarely participated in any type of extracur\u00ad ricular activities; ( 5) there was, in the past, a consistent pattern of failure on the part of these students, and the fact that they would become multiple failures and potential drop\u00ad outs could have been predicted at a con\u00ad siderably earlier point in their educational careers; (6) these students were generally cooperative (perhaps even docile) in a one\u00ad to-one relationship with school authorities, but were highly reticent and refused to initiate or volunteer information of any kind to anyone who in any way represented an authority figure. During the summer program interns under\u00ad took and completed the necessary steps prior to beginning work with the students in prep\u00ad aration for the fall semester. To this end, they met a number of times with each of the students, visited their homes and introduced themselves to the parents, explained to the students and parents their desire to help the students succeed within the school situation, and undertook an intensive study of the school records relating to these children. This study of available records included the development of an acquaintance with both the sociological and psychological back\u00ad grounds of the students involved. It was anticipated that, beginning with the fall se\u00ad mester, an attempt would be made to raise considerably the educational, motivational, and inspirational levels of the students. n. FOLLOW-UP WITH MULTIPLE FAILURES AT RUFUS KING HIGH SCHOOL DURING THE FALL SEMESTER, 1966 At the beginning of the fall semester there were three interns and a team leader com\u00ad prising the National Teacher Corps team at Rufus King High School. It was agreed that each of the interns would work with ap\u00ad proximately eleven of the multiple failures who were investigated during the pre-service project. Two of the interns worked with twelve such multiple failures. As mentioned earlier, each of these students had failed three or more academic subjects during the previous regular school semester (Spring, 1966). As a group, the interns were concerned with two specific behavioral areas of the students as follows: ( 1) pupils' attendance records-to this end, they obtained copies of previous attendance records for the students under consideration for the express purpose of comparing them with the attendance rec\u00ad ords m.a.lntained by the same students dur\u00ad ing the semester in which they received help from the Corpsmembers; (2) pupils' academ- . ic progress-here, as was true with regard to the attendance records, the specific intent was to compare academic progress of the students under consideration after one se\u00ad mester of academic tutoring and of general help, including counseling, which was to be provided by the interns. At the end of the semester, it was obvious that the work undertaken by the Corps\u00ad members had had a significant impact upon the attendance records of the students with whom they dealt. During the previous se\u00ad mester the multiple failures with whom the NTC members worked averaged 18.3 days of absence for the term. For the semester dur\u00ad ing which they worked with the Corpsmem\u00ad bers, the average number of days absent was 10.2, noticeably lower than the average of the previous semester. In addition, it should be noted that the number of days ab\u00ad sent for any given individual during the semester prior to working with the National Teacher Corps varied from three to sixty\u00ad two days of absence. However, while work\u00ad ing with the Corpsmembers, the number of days absence for any given student ranged from zero to forty-one days, again notice\u00ad ably less than was true prior to their having been involved with the Corpsmembers. Many factors contributed to the fact that the students maintained considerably bet\u00ad ter attendance records during the semester in which they worked with the Corpsmem\u00ad bers. For one thing, the Corpsmembers maintained a daily attendance card for each of the students with whom they worked. TABLE !.-Attendance records of multiple failures prior to and during the semester i.n which they worked with National Teacher Corps interns Semester Average Number of absences number of days absent Spring 1966 (prior)_ ___ Varied .from 3 to 63__ 18.3 Falll967 (during) _____ Varied from 0 to 4L_ 10.2 Each student, upon going to school on a given day, was given one of these cards and it was expected that he would have it signed by each of his class teachers during that day. This created a situation in which it was quite difficult for students to inten\u00ad tionally cut class without its being quite obvious to those with whom he was working. Also, whenever a student with whom the Corpsmembers were working was absent, im\u00ad mediate follow-up was made by the intern. In some cases this involved a telepbone call, but 1n most cases it involved a home visit on the part of the intern. Obviously, such close supervision would result in better attendance. With regard to academic success, it is quite noticeable by the figures that will be pre\u00ad sented that considerable help was provided to a number of the multiple failures by the interns operating at Rufus King High School. As mentioned earlier, the thirty-five students with whom they worked had all failed at least three or more academic subjects dur\u00ad ing the previous semester. As the interns worked with the students in tutoring ses\u00ad sions, it should be made clear that they did not deal only with basic skills such as read\u00ad ing except as such skills applied to the sub\u00ad ject being taught. Therefore, such reading skills as syllabication and deriving meaning from context were undertaken when it was necessary as a part of the mathematics, social studies, English, or science tutoring session. Also, approximately half of each tutoring session was spent in general conversation with the student. Such discussions covered topics related to school, home, personal prob\u00ad lems, dating, general community problems, and any others that the student felt like talking about at the time. As a result of these sessions, the students received a con\u00ad siderable amount of help directed toward mediating immediate problems and conflicts with which they were fa.ced. It alsO had a considerable impact upon their self-image since they felt that, at last, here was an adult willing to listen to their problems. willing to discuss them with him, and wm\u00ad ing to help him seek solutions which he was unable to find independently. 4762 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 TABLE 2.-Number of subjects failed by multiple failures after having worked with National Teacher Corps interns Number of subject failureS' 0.-----~------------------- i= = = ~ = = = = = ~ = = = = =~ = = == ==== =~ 3--------------.!.-------'---- ~= = = ::: == ~ = = = ~= = = :: = = == = TotaL __ ------------Number of students 6 7 . 5 6 6 5 35 Percent 17 20 147!1 17 17 14% 100 The work undertaken with students in the area of counseling enabled the interns to help students develop new plans for the future and new strategies for attacking prob\u00ad lems with which they were presently faced. Early in the semester, it became quite obvi\u00ad ous that this type of help was needed by the students if they, were to succeed within any contemporary social setting. The team found that the number of times it was nec\u00ad essary to see each student varied depending on the kinds of problems which the students faced, and also depending on the degree to which such problems were creating internal conflict for the student. With regard to the results, it was found that six of the students with whom the interns worked passed every subject taken. Thus, 17 per cent of the students with whom the interns worked passed all of their sub\u00ad jects; quite remarkable in light of the fact that each of those students had failed at least three academic subjects the previous semester. seven of the students with whom the interns worked failed only one subject during that semester, and one of those stu\u00ad dents failed only gym, so that it might be said that seven students passed all of their academic subjects and only six failed one subject. The seven students who officially fa1led one subject represented 20 per cent of the group with whom the interns chose to work. Another fiye students failed two subjects, and they represented 14.5 per cent of the initial group with whom the interns worked. Thus, it can be pointed out that 18 students, representing 51.5 per cent of the group with whom the interns worked, im\u00ad proved in terms of their academic achieve\u00ad ment pattern during the semester in which they worked with NTC interns. The as\u00ad sumption can be made that the time and effort expended by the interns on behalf of these students was the factor which brought about the change in their academic pattern since to the best of our 'knowledge, no other factors within those students' life patterns were modified in any way. It was noticed by the interns in almost every case\u00b7 with whicH they dealt that the atten.tion paid the students became an initial link in a chain reaction which took on a circular effect; that is, at the outset they paid attention to the student by offering . him individual tutoring and counseling as well as sympathy and other kinds of atten\u00ad tion. The students reacted to the attention which they received by working harder in an attempt to please the person who gave them the initial attention. Because they ex\u00ad pended more effort on their academic work, the quality of the school work undertaken by the students improved considerably and this led to their passing tests within class- rooms, a phenomenon which had not occurred previously. Because th~y wer:e suc\u00ad cessful in their school work, they received more attention from the interns, from their parents, and from other representatives -of the school. This, in turn, initiated another such circle in which the students, as a re\u00ad sult of the attention received, worked harder, experienced success, and therefore received more attention which led them to work harder, achieve more success, which resulted in their receiving more attention, etc., etc., etc. Simultaneously, the interns noticed that the self-concept of the students im\u00ad proved considerably. That is, the \u00b7way in which they viewed themselves led them to attribute higher levels of esteem to their own worth. It was also noticed that, as their self-concept improved, the general disciplinary problems which many of these children presented the previous semester tended to diminish since it was no longer necessary to obtain attention through unde\u00ad sirable a;pd anti-social behavior. In conclusion, it is quite obvious that the National Teacher Corps team, working in cooperation with school authorities, effected a considerable amount of change with regard to those students with whom they worked and who were termed multiple failures. As repeated statements by the school principal have indicated, these students would never have received such help had it not been for the presence of the Teacher Corpsmembers within the school who were willing to give their time and. energy in hopes that success with such students would set them on the right track in the future. There does not appear to be any doubt that in many cases they were successful . A number of the stu\u00ad dents with whom they worked and who were previously considering dropping out of school are now considering completing high school and attending post-graduate work, either in a university or in a technical school of some type. Of consider able importance is the fact that each intez:n derived coiU?iderable personal benefit out of the study with which he was involved. In particular, they derived a num\u00ad ber of insights into the nature of poverty and of failure, and also into the meall$ ~ through which such characteristics can be amelio\u00ad rated. Each has commentedr a number of times and in many different ways regarding ~be impact which such a project woul-d have . on them as they became teachers in their own right. A number ,of, factors were men\u00ad tioned as being particularly important . Among them are the following: 1. Home Visitations--It was found by the interns that home visitations provide a tre\u00ad mendous amount of data about the student, his family, and his attitudes which are valu\u00ad able to the classroom teacher and which such teachers do not usually receive as a result of the~r classroom contacts. In many cases such knowledge enables them to deal considerably more effectively with the stu\u00b7 dents within the classroom situations; 2. School Authority Cooperation-Every intern remarked on the fact that when all the teachers with whom the child deals co\u00ad operate with one another to provide the most effective learning situation for that student, that there is a considerably better chance of their being successful within the school situ\u00ad ation; 3. Administrator-Teacher Relationships\u00ad Each of the interns found that, as a result of their close contact with the principal of the school and. the cooperation provided by his office, that teachers and administrators can effectively work together to provide the best possible learning situation for every student within the school. This includes the pur\u00ad chasing of materials and the determination of what strategies ate most effective when dealing with any given student. The in\u00ad sights which the principal was able to pro\u00ad vide the interns on the basis of his past teaching and administrative experience were found to be invaluable as the interns sought to deal with the students within the context ofthe school situation r In summary , it canJbe emphatically stated that the project described above and under- , taken by the National\"Teacher Corps Interns at Rufus King High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was a tremendous success. This can be measured both in terms of the im\u00ad provement noted within the &tudent;s at the . end. of the semester and also through dis\u00ad cussions with the interns and students as one finds that the knowledge which they have obtained will most assuredly contribute to their becoming the best possible teachers of disadvantaged students. MILITARY PROCUREMENT The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill <S. 665) to authorize appro\u00ad priations during the fiscal year. 1967 for procurement of aircraft, missiles, and tracked combat vehicles, and research, development, test, evaluation, and mili\u00ad tary construction for the Armed Forces, and for other purposes. Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, the Sen\u00ad ator from Pennsylvania [Mr. CLARK] has heard me apologize before; I apologize again. I am sorry I took longer than I estimated to him I would take, and yet the \u00b7unanimous-consent agreement for tomorrow would make it impossible for me to make this record tomorrow. I feel it, is important that the evidence that I put in the RECORD be made a part of the record, and that the attention of the Senate be drawn to what is happening in this country in regard to our critical domestic needs because of the policy we are following in Vietnam. I want to change that policy, for many reasons, but one of them is so we can meet the needs of the Great Society pro\u00ad gram and try to resurrect it ourselves, because the administration is not going to try to. The President can send all the messages to Congress that he wants to. . He can send a poverty message. He can send a message on the District of Colum\u00ad bia. He can send a message on civil rights. He can send a message on labor. All the messages he has been sending to Congress make good campaign mate\u00ad rial, but, let us face it, unless the Presi\u00ad dent makes a fight for these programs, they are simply interesting preparations for getting ready for the 1968 campaigns, He did not make a fight for them last year. Messages came to the Congress, and, with little help from the White House, we battled here for critically needed domestic programs. As far as I am concerned, I am not in\u00ad terested in messages or promises; I am interested in delivery. I want to see the Senate proceed to deliver 1n meeting the needs of the American people in regard to the domestic issues that I raised in my speech this afternoon . I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CLARK. The Senator from Ore\u00ad gon need not apologize. It was a pleas\u00ad ure to sit here and listen to his logical analysis of the situation in Vietnam and administration policies with respect . thereto. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that I may yield to the junior Sena\u00ad tor from South Carolina [Mr. HOLLINGS] without losing my right to the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER <Mr. BYRD of West Virginia in the chair). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it has been said that-- -War is too important to be left 'to the Clenerals. Having listened to the recommenda\u00ad tions for the war in Vietnam for the past February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4763 few days in this Chamber, I am con\u00ad strained to observe that perhaps war is too important to be left to Senators. Certainly this great Nation would have never survived, we would never have won in combat, with the commands being given here. \"Withdraw,\" says one Senator. An\u00ad other says: \"We only blundered in, and we should admit this mistake and get out.\" \"Stop the bombing,\" say a dozen more \"Talk to them,\" plead others. \"Give blood to the Vietcong,\" advises one. Even the distinguished chairman <>f our Foreign Relations Committee writes of our \"Arrogance of Power.\" The din of criticism mounts so that even the Commander in Chief has become gun\u00ad shy. The President, in his state of the Un\u00ad ion address, did not hesitate to reaffirm our declar:1.tion of war on poverty and proudly said: We shall not rest until this war is won. But to the war in Vietnam he an\u00ad nounced only that we would \"stand 1lrm.\" He sounded almost apologetic. Per\u00ad haps the President felt that words of determination and victory would serve only to set the doves aflutter; that other than financial support, no other support was needed from the Congress--or ex\u00ad pected; and that his best bet was to avoid stirring up a bad situation by em\u00ad phasizing Vietnam; that it would be bet\u00ad ter to 'try for domestic accomplish-ment with an eye on the 19'68 elections. I sub\u00ad mit that the people will not look for domestic accomplishment in 19'68; it will not be a New Frontier they seek; it will be an old frontier-an age-old precept of nationHloquently expressed by Winston Churchill when he said: Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival. Our people will be looking for the re\u00ad turn of their L sons and daughters. And rather than dignity from poverty for themselves, they will demand interna\u00ad tional dignity for the United States of America. The President does Indeed need more than financial support for Vietnam. He needs -moral support for our commit\u00ad ment to defeat the enemy. We must let that enemy know that this is not the administration's war, or Johnson's war, <>r McNamara's war, or the Hawks' war-but this is the Nation's war. Ho Chi Minh must know that we are united in our determination to win. Then and only then will he stop his aggression. Let me comment on the debilitating and divisive. I do so as no expert, but Vietnam-like the subject \"women\"\u00ad has no expert. \u00b7 Most damaging to our stance is the constant revelation by self\u00ad styled Vietnam experts in the Senate that we have no right to be there-that we.really did not mean to be there-that somehow we just blundered in. Each of these authorities are quick to point out that Vietnam has been at ~ar for 20 years, and just as quickly avoid the fact that the United States has been com\u00ad mitted to fight in Vietnam for 12 years. In April 1954, President Eisenhower pleaded with Winston Churchill for a \"coalition composed of nations which have a vital concern in the checking of Communist expansion in the area\"; and this coalition \"must be willing to join the fight.\" Under Eisenhower, join the fight we did-a course which was reaffirmed by President Kennedy in 1~61 and Presi\u00ad dent Johnson in 1964. To those who continue to lament, \"Who asked us to help South Vietnam?\" my answer is \"Our conscience.\" \u00b7 Since the decisions of three Presidents are necessary to the one decision of en\u00ad try, there is some support for the feel\u00ad ing that we blundered in. But, a war of national liberation does not begin as did World War II. The war of national lib\u00ad eration countenances no sudden attack on Pearl Harbor. On the contrary, true to the three stages of war of Mao Tse Tung, the infiltration is gradual, the ter\u00ad rorism and guerrilla phase intermittent, and the actual attack so obscured as to appear liberation. It would have been ~clean and clear had each of the three Presidents been afforded a joint session of Congress for formal declaration of war. But such was not their response\u00ad nor should it have been. Much soul searching and many days of delibera\u00ad tion, guided each of our three Presidents in their decision to fight in Vietnam. I repeat-their decisions were deliberate. Their deCisions were patterned after the threat. To me, their decisions were right. But right or wrong, this body should know we did not blunder into Vietnam. \u00b7Well, the. Vietnam \"experts\" of, the Senate immediately counter, it is a blun\u00ad der to stay. Ten thousand miles away, infested with disease, the country is not worth fighting for. The South VIet\u00ad namese will not fight for themselves. At a cost of $2 billion a month-and already with 7,400 deaths and 45,000 cas- ualties-they will bleed us dry. -~ \"Besides,\" conclude the experts, \"we can't afford, and should,n't try to be world policemen .\" I only wish we had a choice in the matter. One battleship alone still flies the flag of the United States. With 46 Governors a few years ago, I visited this ship. She has a crew of 1.100 men\u00ad none braver, none more dedicated. Un\u00ad fortunately, the Arizona, and her crew, lie 62 feet underwater at Pearl Harbor. The infamous attack that placed her there was quick, dramatic, and deadly. The United States stood alone that De\u00ad cember day 25 years ago as the police\u00ad man of the world. We did not ask for this role-I d0 not believe any of us really want it-but it is irrevocably ours if freedom is to survive at this time and place in history. Again and again, this role of policeman has been thrust upon us-at Berlin, Korea, Guatemala, Suez, Greece, Lebanon, Cuba, the Congo, and the Dominican Republic, and now in South Vietnam. That we assumed this role must be credited with the relative stability that the world enjoys today. Providing this balance wheel of freedbm, tbe United States should never be charged with overplaying its hand. The nations we have conquered-the nations we have freed-they all enjoy self\u00ad government without interference from the United States. The aggression in South Vietnam was not as quick nor as dramatic as was Pearl Harbor, but cer\u00ad tainly it has been as deadly. Over 50,000 South Vietnamese have been killed. Their leadership systematically snuffed out, their teachers murdered, their women terrorized, their children maimed. Yet South Vietnam refuses to sue for peace. Instead, her resistance stiffens. She has held a free election, checked inflation, and is about to adopt a con\u00ad stitution. A land of wealth-one only has to visit to understand why the French fought so hard to keep her. Billy Graham has said South Vietnam could feed the 500 million people in India and the 800 million in Red China. This was a prime target of the Japanese in World War II, and China sees why today. The domino theory is not theory to Mao Tse Tung. He has indicated clearly that his intention is to take South Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Indo\u00ad nesia, the Philippines, Australia, the Far East and the world. Foot dragging by the Soviet on this goal of world conquest is China's difference with the Soviet to\u00ad day. Our European allies may pout and palaver, but those in the Par East di\u00ad rectly affected by the war in Vietnam see the danger and are fighting and dying with us. We continue to mount support daily. The bombing in the north \u00b7 has slowed Ho Chi Minh. Other than\u00b7 guer\u00ad rilla skirmishes by the Vietcong, the North Vietnamese have not attacked since June 1966. We are winning politi\u00ad cally and militarily in Vietnam today. Ho Chi Minh se,es for the first time he \u00b7can lose, and he moves cleverly and quickly with his one remaining strategy. He has no air force. He has no navy. He has no artillery. He has only one weapon left-psychological and political warfare. For this he has many allies. Whether it be France or Britain, U Thant or a Senator, the cry for peace, to an aggressor, means encouragement. The strategy of the aggressor is clear. Necessary to this strategy is the doubt, anxiety, and confusion of the American people. Let us not, in the Senate, lead the way. Let us not unconscio~sly give aid and comfort to the enemy. Let us .not i~olate a portion of our ffiilitary strategy, the \u00b7bombing, and ignore the murder, maiming, terrorism of North Vietnam. Let us acknowledge that the United States has meticulously avoided bombing civilian populations; that th,e cities of North Vietnam are intact_ Let us acknowledge that the bombing has aided .in slowing the aggression; has saved many American lives, and is hurt\u00ad ing North Vietnam in its aggression. Let us not blind ourselves to the truth that North Vietnam is the aggressor. Let us agree that we have been willing to t~lk peace; that actually we have cried peace so readily and so often as to sound weak and indecisive. Rather than building new bridges to the East, let us first cross our bridge of \u00b7commitment to Vietnam. , Let \u00b7us ap\u00ad plaud General Westmoreland and his meri for their skill, their patience, their courage, and their dedication; and, for 4764 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967\u00b7 a change, here in Congress, let us tell the world we mean business in Vietnam. Mr. President, I yield the :floor. CONSIDERATION OF CONVENTIONS TOMORROW-MODIFIED UNANI\u00ad MOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, the unanimous-consent request I am about to make has been cleared on both sides. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00ad sent that upon the completion of morn\u00ad ing business tomorrow, the Senate go into executive session to consider the treaties on the Executive Calendar; and that at that time and without further debate of the treaties, the Senate act on them, as follows: First. The first three treaties on the calendar, Calendar Nos. 1 through 3, inclusive, be considered and voted on en bloc. Second. That the fourth and fifth treaties on the calendar, Calendar Nos. 4 and 5, be considered and voted on en bloc. . Third. That the next five treaties on the calendar, Calendar Nos. 6 through 10, inclusive, be considered and voted on en bloc. I further ask that the action on the treaties be entered separately in the Ex\u00ad ecutive Journal and the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and that before the action on each treaty is recorded in the RECORD that the explanation thereof that will be given today on the Senate :floor be re\u00ad peated in the RECORD as if given at that time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the several requests of the Senator from Montana? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous unanimous-consent agreement limiting debate on the military procurement bill .be modified to read \"after the vote on the treaties.\" The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? There being no objection, the modified unanimous-consent agreement was or\u00ad dered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: Ordered, That, effective on March 1, 1967, after the vote on the treaties, during the further consideration of the blll (S. 665), to authoriZe appropriations during the fiscal year 1967 for procurement of aircraft, mis\u00ad siles, and tracked combat vehicles, and re\u00ad search, development, test, evaluation, and m111tary construction for the Armed Forces, and for other purposes, debate on any amend\u00ad ment, motion, or appeal, except a motion to lay on the table, shall be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided and controlled by the mover of any such amendment or motion and the majority leader: Provided, That in the event the majority leader is in favor of any such amendment or motion, the time in opposition thereto shall be controlled by the minority leader or some Senator desig\u00ad nated by him: Provided further, That no amendment that is not germane to the pro\u00ad visions of the &aid blll shall be received. Ordered further, That. on the question of the final passage of the said bill debate shall be limited to 4 hours, to be equally divided and controlled, respectively, by the majority and minority leaders: Provided, That the said leaders, or either of them, may, from the time under their control on the passage of the said bill, allot additional time to any Senator during the consideration of any amendment, motion, or appeal. MILITARY PROCUREMENT The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill (S. 665) to authorize appro\u00ad priations during the fiscal year 1967 for procurement of aircraft, missiles, and tracked combat vehicles, and research, development, test, ev\u00b7aluation, and mill\u00ad tary construction for the Armed Forces, and for other purposes. \u00b7 Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, the pend\u00ad ing military authorization bill is the first war measure to come before the Senate in this new 90th Congress. I realize that the manager of the bill, the Senator from Georgi\u00b7a [Mr. RUSSELL], will take the position that this is not a policy bill, but that it is only a measure to insure that our fighting forc\u00b7es receive the tools needed to implement policy. I cannot agree. This is a policy bill. No matter what may be said to the.con\u00ad trary, this bill will be added to the long list of measures which omcials of the administration readily cite as proof of congressional participation in the mak\u00ad ing, and the support, of its war policies. Members of the Foreign Relations Committee were quite surprised to learn from Secretary Rusk last year that by approving aid for Vietnam each year they had been supporting what he ap\u00ad parently considers as an open-ended mil\u00ad itary commitment to South Vietnam. A year ago, following a vote of 92 to 5 to table, the amendment of the senior Sen\u00ad ator from Oregon [Mr. MoRsE] to the supplemental military authorization bill, which would haYe repealed the south\u00ad east Asia resolution, m.any Senators were somewhat puzzled to learn that the Deputy Under Secretary of St&.te, speak\u00ad ing to a foreign audience, made it ap\u00ad pear that the resolution was thus re\u00ad affirmed by this margin. Senators should not be surprised to learn that their votes are used. And it is because of this that we must look at this bill as much more than a nuts-and-bolts meas\u00ad ure. It should be seen as a vehicle for reasserting the Senate's constitutional role in grave questions of war and peace. Supplemental authorization by sup\u00ad plemental appropriation, this Nation has been inched into a war which has poi\u00ad soned our political dialog, obsessed the energies and thoughts of men in public life, starved public needs, baffled and frustrated the public, and seriously im\u00ad paired the conduct of foreign policy. Accordingly, Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 99 and ask that it be read. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HoLLINGS in the chair). The amend\u00ad ment will be stated. The legislative clerk read as follows: TITLE IV-STATEMENT OF CONGRES\u00ad SIONAL POLICY SEc. 401. It is hereby declared to be the sense of the Congress- (1) that none of the funds authorized by this Act or any other Act should be used to carry out military operations in or over North Vietnam or to increase the number of United States military personnel in South Vietnam above five hundred thousand, unless there shall have been a declaration of war against North Vietnam by the Congress in ac\u00ad cordance with article 1, section 8, of the Con\u00ad stitution of the United States; and (2) that the Congress support those efforts being made by men of good will throughout the world to prevent an expansion of the war in Vietnam and to bring that conflict to an end through a negotiated settlement which will preserve the honor of the United States, protect the vital interests of this country, and allow the people of South Viet\u00ad nam to determine the affairs of that nation in their own way. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, in sup\u00ad port of this amendment, let me remind Senators of some of the economic, social, and political costs of the bleeding wound which is Vietnam. Let us look first at the assets, and then at the liabilities, of our present policies in southeast Asia. In short: What price glory? First, as to the assets: It has been said that our efforts in Vietnam are es\u00ad sential to the security of the United States; that the non-Communist nations of Asia will fall like dominoes if the Viet\u00ad cong and their North Vietnamese allies should succeed; that we must fight in Vietnam, because to do otherwise would be to reward aggression and encourage new so-called wars of national libera\u00ad tion; and finally, that we must do what we are doing to contain the aggressive thrust of Communist China. Even if one concedes the truth of all these assertions-and I certainly do not-one is still required to ask: What are the costs of our efforts? Let me touch briefly on the alleged assets. I do not believe, and I do not be\u00ad lieve it is possible to demonstrate, that Vietnam is essential to the security of the United States. Neither do I believe, despite the able argument to the con\u00ad trary just made by the distinguished jun\u00ad ior Senator from South Carolina [Mr. HoLLINGS], that the non-Communist na\u00ad tions of Asia would fall like a row of dominoes if the Vietcong and their North Vietnamese allies should succeed. This, of course, must be a question of judg\u00ad ment, on which men of good will will differ. But I would suggest that the enlight\u00ad ened consensus of informed opinion, not only in this country but throughout the world, has treated the domino theory as completely discredited by events which have occurred in Southeast Asia during the last 5, 10, or perhaps 15 years. The argument that we must :fight in Vietnam because to do otherwise would be to reward aggression cannot stand up in the face of what is obviously a civil war, in which two factions within South Vlenam, one of them supported by Hanoi, the other supported by the United States of America, are endeavoring to subjugate that country by a dictatorship, alleged, on the one hand, to be Commu\u00ad nist, and clearly, on the other hand, pretty close to being Nazi, since its leader has indicated on many occasions that Adolf Hitler is his hero. I refer, of course, to General Ky. Finally, that we must do what we are doing is said to be an asset so that we can contain the aggressive thrust of Communist China. Yet, Mr. President. Communist China is presently faced with February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4765 chaos. If they ever had any offensive capabilities to send vast masses south of their border, that capability is pretty wen lost in the situation that now exists in which army is fighting army and in which we have almost a recreation of the situation which existed toward the end and shortly after World War II. So, I conclude that the alleged assets with respect to our Vietnam policy are indeed paper assets which have no mar\u00ad ket value. Let us turn now to the liabilities of our Vietnamese policy in determining what price we are paying for an alleged glory of old-fashioned, 19th-century patriot\u00ad ism. First. It so absorbs the time and at\u00ad tention of the Nation's leaders--both in the Congress and in the executive branch-that they have little time for anything else. The war is a consuming passion on which no man in public life can be neutral. I know of no issue since I have been in public life which has so preoccupied the hearts and minds of our leaders. Although public affairs go on, the thought, energies, and spirit so nec\u00ad essary to solve the critical problems of our society are focused not on the prob\u00ad lems of Harlem or Watts-but on a jun\u00ad gleland halfway around the world. The sores of our society grow and fester, without adequate attention or aid. Second. Every Member of this body is familiar with what this war is costing in terms of cutbacks in programs of im\u00ad portance to his State, from highways to hospitals. According to the figures in the President's budget message there would be a $16 billion surplus this fiscal year if we were not fighting the Vietnam war. Think of what we could do to improve our society and make a better world by putting these vast amounts to constructive, instead of destructive, uses. Third. There is little likelihood that major agreements with the Soviet Union toward a less-menacing world can be reached until this war is settled. An insignificant Consular Treaty is in deep trouble in the Senate, and the East-West trade bill is a dead issue this session. The spring of hope for real detente has been poisoned by Vietnam. Fourth. All efforts to bring Commu\u00ad nist China into the company of civilized nations at the U.N. and elsewhere are bogged down by the war, while she gloats over our deepening involvement in the morass of southeast Asia. Fifth. Forward movement toward true collective security within the structure of the United Nations has come to a halt. Sixth. There has been a deterioration in both the Senate and the House in the will to act as a cooperating partner of the Executive in the search for a just and lasting peace. Suspicion and dis\u00ad trust have replaced cooperation and con\u00ad fidence. Seventh. The public image of the United States all around the world has been changed from a benevolent Uncle Sam seeking to do more than his share in curing the ills of the world, to a power-hungry empire, bent on establish\u00ad ing by force of arms a Pax Americana without regard for the views of others, . whether adversaries or allies. There is something drastically wrong with a so-ciety that spends $24 billion in a war which does not involve its vital--or even major-interests and only $2 billion to help the two-thirds of this world who are poor or hungry. Eighth. Our efforts to balance our in\u00ad ternational payments and to achieve the commonsense objective of providing for the adequate financing of international trade and the gradual abandonment of the gold exchange standard have been crippled, if not killed. The dollar drain of Vietnam is enormous, with millions ending in Swiss bank accounts of local Vietnamese profiteers. Mr. President, I am seriously concerned at our international monetary situation. I am concerned because of the constant drain on our gold, a drain in large part occasioned because we are a deficit and not a surplus country, a drain which will continue as long as the combined ex\u00ad penditures for military forces maintained in Europe and in Vietnam exceed the ex\u00ad cess of our exports over our imports. And it may well be, unless we can remedy the situation by bringing home a major part of our troops from Europe and bringing home our boys from Vietnam, that we will find a run on American gold coming, perhaps in the most embarrass\u00ad ing time it could for the Johnson ad\u00ad ministration, in the middle of next sum\u00ad mer with the 1968 election going full swing. So I raise this flag of warning. The balance of payments is not a tech\u00ad nical problem which we can ignore. It is an important international issue which affects the life and well-being of every American citizen. Unless we can bring our balance of payments into surplus or at least into balance within the next 12 months, I do not hesitate to predict a financial situation in the international community as serious as that of the Lon\u00ad don Economic Conference which failed in 1933, resulting in our going off the gold standard and bringing international trade almost to a halt. Ninth. 5,00\u00b78 American boys were killed in combat last year, more than three times the total killed prior to 1966. There are few communities in our coun\u00ad try which have not had at least one mili\u00ad tary funeral this year. The buildup of U.S. forces continues and the casualty lists grow in length as Americans take over the primary fighting job from the South Vietnamese, and as our forces move into the treacherous Mekong Delta-accordingly, having American boys doing the fighting which Asian boys should be doing to preserve whatever freedom they may desire. Tenth. We are destroying the nation of South Vietnam and its people. Civilian casualties of the war obviously number in the thousands each month, although official statistics are not made available, apparently because they are too embar\u00ad rassing. Martha Gellhorn wrote in the January Ladies Home Journal that the estimated increase in Vietnam orphans is 2,000 each month. Our massive mili\u00ad tary presence drove the Saigon price in\u00ad dex up 40 percent last year and about the same the year before. The retail price of rice went up 30 percent in Saigon last month alone. Before the Americans intervened in South Vietnam, that country was a rice surplus country. It was export\u00ad ing rice for valuable foreign exchange. It was available to export rice to North Vietnam, a deficit country, if some sort of peace could be arranged. But today the Americans are sending hundreds if not thousands of tons of rice to feed these people, who are no longer able to harvest their crops, in large part because of the depredations of the Viet\u00ad cong, but also in significant part because of the operations of the American Army in South Vietnam-the napalm, the fires, the machineguns, the killing, the deaths, the terror which drives the peasants from the fields. Eleventh. Our political dialog has been distorted and warped as it has not been since the McCarthy era. I am re\u00ad ferring to Senator Joseph McCarthy. The very fabric of our political life has been torn asunder. Liberal-conservative lines are mean\u00ad ingless on the Vi.etnam issue. There is a sense of public frustration and distrust of their government and its leaders which, if unheeded, could result in mas\u00ad sive loss of confidence in the basic insti\u00ad tutions of our democratic society. The credibility gap is no joke. It is an actu\u00ad ality which should frighten us who be\u00ad lieve in democracy far more than it has done so far. If the people lose confidence in their government, democracy is in\u00ad deed in jeopardy. Twelfth. But perhaps the greatest cost of all of this war, as of most wars which have preceded it, is the brutalization of human nature and the turning aside of our aspirations for man through the re\u00ad vival of the primitive instinct for com\u00ad bat which glories in the daily statistics of the number of Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops killed in the last 24 hours and pushes under the carpet the weekly figures of South Vietnamese and American casualties. Surely, a nation engaged in the spec\u00ad tator sport of watching people kill each other on television is not the kind of nation in which we can expect the com\u00ad passion and the sense of international cooperation which is essential to bring a just and lasting peace to the world. If the war proves anything, it attests to the validity of Alexander Pope's phrase, \"The greatest enemy of mankind is man.\" Mr. President, some point has been made of the application of the Tonkin Bay resolution as authorizing everything that has ~n done since it was passed, in terms of military authorizations and appropriations. Yet, I suggest that the simple answer to that argument can be found in the Senate debate on the South\u00ad east Asia Resolution. When we passed that resolution, some 16,000 U.S. soldiers were in Vietnam; their purpose was to advise and train Vietnamese troops-not to fight a war. The debate in the Senate, and subse\u00ad quent statements by the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, who handled the resolution, clearly prove that the resolution was not meant to be taken as a blank check for involving the Nation in war. I introduce this amendment and call it'up as a means of stimulating Congress to have the courage to meet its consti-4766 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE February 28, 1967 tutional duties on issues involving war and peace. All Members of this body have at one time expressed concern about the erosion of congressional power and the growing domination of Congress by the executive branch. The issue my amendment poses illustrates quite well why this trend continues--because Con\u00ad gress simply\u00b7 has not had the guts to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities. It is much easier to let the President take the heat than to assume the burden of decision for formally declaring war, or, in the alternative, for exercising that power over the purse string which has been the historical prerogative of legis\u00ad lators in free societies all over the world. I wonder how many of my colleagues would have voted for the southeast Asia resolution if they knew on August 7, 1964, what they know today; or how our constituents would have reacted if they had known that their representatives, in voting for the resolution, were going to be told by the S_ecretary of State and to some extent by the President, himself, that they were giving the Commander in Chief a blank check. We have bypassed the people and we have bypassed Congress in the decision\u00ad making process on this war. The repre\u00ad sentatives of the people, in Congress, have failed to tackle the Vietnam prob\u00ad lem, taking the easy way out by defer\u00ad ring to the executive branch. The Presi\u00ad dent and his advisers have neither a monopoly on brains nor on virtue nor on constitutional power. As representa\u00ad tives of the people of this land, who pay in lives and dollars for this war, it is past time for Congress to decide whether our vital interests are truly at stake in this conflict. If they are not, we should set a price on wha.Jt we will pay to pro\u00ad tect interests that may be only desirable and not essential. Are these interests so\u00b7 vital that we should continue to fun\u00ad nel the lives of thousands of our finest young men and tens of billions down a bottomless Asian rat hole? This is the question Congress should decide. This amendment gives the Senate an oppor\u00ad tunity to do so. Congress has passed the buck too long and too often. The Constitution says that the buck for putting this Nation at war stops here, not in the executive branch. I hope the Senate will have the courage to do its constitutional duty. I yield the floor. Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment, in the nature of a substitute, and ask that it be read. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HoLLINGS in the chair). The amend\u00ad ment, in the nature of a substitute, will be stated. The assistant legislative clerk read the amendment, in the nature of a substi\u00ad tute, as follows: In lieu of the language of the amendment No. 99 insert the following: \"TITLE IV. STATEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL POLICY \"SEC. 401. The Congress hereby decla.res\u00ad \"(1) its firm intentions to provide all necessary support for members of the Armed Forces of the United States fighting in Viet\u00ad nam; \"(2) its support of efforts being made by the President ot the United States and other men of good wm throughout the world to prevent an expansion of the war in Vietnam and to bring that conflict to an end through a negotiated settlement which will preserve the honor of the United States, protect the vital interests of this country, and allow the people of South Vietnam to determine the affairs of that nation in their own way; and \"(3) its support of the Geneva accords of 1954 and urges the convening of that Con\u00ad ference or any other meeting of nations similarly involved and interested as soon as possible for the purpose of formulating plans for bringing the confiict to an honorable conclusion in accordance with the principles of those accords.\" Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come be\u00ad fore the Senate- Mr. CLARK. Mr. President , will the Senator yield? Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I have read hastily the amendment which the Senator from Montana has offered as a substitute. In order that the RECORD may be com\u00ad plete this evening and so that Senators may see where we are when they read the RECORD in the morning, I wish to read into the RECORD at this point my amend\u00ad ment No. 100 which I had announced I intended to bring up in the event my amendment No. 99 were voted down. Amendment No. 100 reads as follows: SEc. 401. The Congress hereby declares\u00ad (!) its firm intentions to provide all neces- sary support for members of the Armed Forces of the United States fighting in Viet\u00ad nam; I point out that that part of my second amendment is identical with the first paragraph of the amendment of the Sen\u00ad ator from Montana. Mr. MANSFIELD. The Senator is cor\u00ad rect. Mr. CLARK. My second paragraph reads as follows: (2) its support of efforts being made by men of good will throughout the world to prevent an expansion of the war in Vietnam and to bring that conflict to an end through a negotiated settlement which will preserve the honor of the United States, protect the vital interests of this country, and allow the people of South Vietnam to determine the affairs of that nation in their own way; and I ask my friend from Montana whether that paragraph No.2 is not substantially identical to his paragraph 2. Mr. MANSFIELD. Substantially, but not definitely, because I included the President in paragraph 2, as well as other men of good will. I believe that is the only difference I can note at the moment. Mr. CLARK. I would certainly have no objection to that change. Paragraph (3) of my amendment states: (3) its support of the Geneva Conference Agreement of 1954 and the final declaration of that Conference as a basis for a settlement of the Vietnam war, and to that end urges that the Conference be reconvened as soon as practicable for the purpose .of formulating plans to effectively implement that 8\u20acI'ee\u00ad ment. I ask my friend from Montana whether that paragraph (3) of my amendment is not substantially in accord with para\u00ad graph <3) of his amendment. Mr. MANSFIELD. Substantially but not definitely, because in addition to the Geneva accords we say, \"or any other meeting of nations similarly involved,'~ which would, for example, include the Percy proposal for an all-Asian meeting~ or the proposal that the matter be re\u00ad ferred to the United Nations or other proposals of a similar nature. I would say, in general, the language I suggest is simHar but differs in that important respect-it not only includes parties to the Geneva conference, but any other interested parties that have been considered. Mr. CLARK. I wish to say to my good friend from Montana that despite the fact that the amendments are not identi\u00ad cal, they are so completely similar that I would be glad to support the amend\u00ad ment of the Senator from Montana and give him all due credit for having pro\u00ad posed it. I do have the somewhat difficult par\u00ad liamentary problem of attempting to get a vote on my somewhat more rigorous amendment. I shall think overnight how to do that and perhaps we can end up with the same result which I intended to achieve before the Senator offered his amendment. I congratulate the Senator for going at least halfway down the road that I would like to follow. Mr. MANSFIELD. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Pennsyl\u00ad vania. I wish him well in his overnight study. I hope the amendment offered in the nature of a substitute would be considered on its merits, and apart from the original resolution in the form of an amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a parliamentary in\u00ad quiry? Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, a parlia\u00ad mentary inquiry. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it. Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, if the amendment of the Senator from Mon\u00ad tana in the nature of a substitute were to be approved by the Senate, would it then be in order for me to offer, as an additional amendment, my amendment No. 99? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment would be in order at another place, but not as an amendment to the amendment of tlie Senator from Mon\u00ad tana. Mr. CLARK. If the Presiding Officer will permit me, may I suggest that I be\u00ad lieve we are talking at cross-purposes. My understanding is that if the amend\u00ad ment of the Senator from Montana is agreed to, the bill would then be open to further amendment. Is that correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, but the question would then be on the amendment of the Senator from Penn\u00ad sylvania, as amended. Mr. CLARK. By way of further amendment, would it be in order for me to offer at that point my amendment No. \u00b7 99, which would not have the effect of February 28, 1967 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE 4767 amending the amendment of the Sena\u00ad tor from Montana? The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be in order. TRANSACTION OF ADDITIONAL ROUTINE BUSINESS By unanimous consent, the following additional routine business was trans\u00ad acted: EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS, ETC. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem\u00ad pore laid before the Senate the following letters, which were referred as indicated: FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF BOYS' CLUBS OF AMERICA A letter from the president, Boys' Clubs o,f America, New York, N.Y., transmitting, pursuant to law, an audited financial state\u00ad ment of that organization, for the year 1966 (with an accompanying document); to the Committee on the Judiciary.
