Eczema, the common name for [atopic dermatitis](https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/atopic-dermatitis), is the most common form of chronic inflammation of the skin. Also called the \" [itch that rashes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538209/),\" the disease is known to make your skin dry, red and itchy. One in five children and up to one in 10 adults [live with](https://nationaleczema.org/research/eczema-facts/) eczema. \"Eczema is an Dina Strachan](https://www.instagram.com/drdinamd/?hl=en), a board-certified dermatologist in New York. She added that the condition begins in infancy and lasts your whole life. Specifically, [research shows that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2957505/) 60 percent of people with eczema experience their first symptoms by their first birthday, 75 percent experience symptoms by age five, and up to 30 percent first get those symptoms as adults. Eczema also makes you more sensitive to products such as creams, washes and perfumes; the wrong skin care products could trigger a flare-up and worsen symptoms, while the right ones could provide relief.

[What is eczema?](https://www.today.com/shop/face-wash-lotion-treatments-eczema-t173115#anchor-Whatiseczemaandwhatcausesit) | [What to look for](https://www.today.com/shop/face-wash-lotion-treatments-eczema-t173115#anchor-WhatshouldIlookforineczemaskincareproducts) | [Best care for | | What is eczema and what causes it? Eczema is a common skin disorder that causes your skin to get dry, red and itchy, and may give it a blotchy rash. \"Scientists haven't really determined the cause of eczema. It's believed to be a mix of environmental and genetic factors,\" says [Dr. Kemunto Mokaya](http://www.drkemmymd.com/), a board-certified dermatologist in Texas. People with eczema have a \"leaky\" skin barrier that prevents their skin from retaining enough moisture. Without the protection of a healthy barrier to lock in moisture, their skin loses fluid, making it drier and more likely to get infected, or for harmful chemicals to enter the skin. That's why those with eczema are more easily irritated by common chemicals and allergy-causing substances. What should I look for in eczema skin care products? A daily moisturizing routine that helps lock in moisture is essential if you want to reduce symptoms and experience relief. But you have to avoid any substances that can worsen your symptoms. Choosing skin care products is a balancing act: You have to avoid irritants while looking for ingredients that give your skin the moisture and cleansing it needs. There are certain terms and labels you can look for to help with this choice. Products with these labels are more likely to help moisturize your skin without triggering a flare-up or exposing you to other health risks. - Moisturizing. Cleansers with this label often contain ceramides, glycerin or hyaluronic acid, which are a good start: They help hydrate your skin and restore the natural skin barrier. - Fragrance-free. Any perfumes or scents can potentially irritate your skin; when in doubt, you are safer without them. - Non-foaming. Foaming cleansers tend to dry out your skin more, causing more irritation. Non-foaming products are typically gentler and less likely to strip your skin of all natural oils. - Hypoallergenic. Products with this label are formulated with minimal or no allergy-causing substances. - Sulfate-free. Products with sulfates can strip your skin of its natural oils and worsen irritation. - pH-balanced. This helps to keep your skin from losing its acidity and protects it from harmful bacteria. If your symptoms continue to worsen or nothing you do to take care of your skin provides relief, it's a good idea to see your doctor, dermatologist or other medical professional. Many other conditions in addition to eczema can cause red, irritated skin, so your professional care team can take a look and advise you accordingly. From expert-approved [gentle face washes](https://www.today.com/style/15-drugstore-face-washes-celebrity-experts-trust-great-skin-t102678) to [soothing lotions](https://www.today.com/shop/best-lotions-t191301) that relieve irritation, here are the best skin care products for people with eczema.

Instead, this has the creaminess of a lotion combined with the lightness of a gel \u2014 a texture I was unused to but pleasantly surprised by,\" she writes in her review, adding that it also imparts a pleasant cooling sensation. In addition to the usual hydrating and soothing ingredients like niacinamide, camellia leaf extract and glycerin, this cream uses the plant-derived ingredient [Cortinhib G](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Detail/1371/5484716/Cortinhib-G), which counterbalances the cortisol (stress hormone) to help your skin reinforce its natural barrier.

(Note: It's also available in a subtle rosemary and lavender scent.) And Sales can attest that you can literally use this all over \u2014 including her lips! Unlike petroleum jelly, which Sales often used to soothe eczema-related itching and dryness, this one functions similarly, but is a lot creamier and less sticky. It uses plant-based ingredients that include jojoba esters, colloidal oatmeal and camellia leaf extract. Plus, it's been tested by both pediatricians and dermatologists. We also highly recommend the brand's gentle and fragrance-free (or subtly scented) [Everyday Lotion](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=ucE5BarM2zo&mid=1237&u1=173115eczemaproducts&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Ftubby-todd-bath-co-everyday-lotion%2F5898429) and [Hair & Body Wash](https://babylist.pxf.io/gbrZOv?subId1=173115eczemaproducts&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.babylist.com%2Fgp%2Ftubby-todd-hair-body-wash-shampoo-body%2F21376%2F672159) for those with sensitive skin.

But after she saw its almost immediate results (and the fact that it's often sold out on the brand's site), she became a believer. Magic Molecule is a single hypoallergenic, all-natural, alcohol-free and fragrance-free solution that is said to help boost the healing of not just the symptoms of eczema, but also bug bites, pimples, sunburns, cuts and more. And that's while being safe for even the most sensitive of skins \u2014) and yes, that includes babies. What's more, it's certified by the Eczema Association, is TSA-friendly and comes in a two-pack (a steal, if you ask us). The secret ingredient is hypochlorous acid, something produced by white blood cells for healing purposes, and something that the brand replicated in an FDA-cleared lab. So far, Sales has successfully sped up healing on a sunburn, facial acne, facial redness, and a particularly vicious bug bites. When she has no particular ailments, she likes to use this as a toner spray on her face before bed. Questions about eczema, answered by experts Can I get rid of eczema permanently? \"Eczema is forever,\" says Strachan. A chronic condition that many are born with, getting rid of eczema permanently may not be possible. However, many people experience fewer symptoms as they grow older, and proper skin care can also reduce your symptoms. What am I lacking if I have eczema? Eczema is a complex condition, and no single nutrient or substance (or lack thereof) is known to cause it. However, some studies suggest that people with eczema may have deficiencies in certain nutrients, such as vitamins D, E and A, zinc, and essential fatty acids. An imbalance in your microbiome may also play a role. If you have concerns about your microbiome or meeting your vitamin and mineral needs, speak to your medical care team. How can I boost my immunity to eczema? There is no one specific way to boost your immune system against eczema. However, you can support your overall health and potentially reduce the risk of eczema flare-ups with FRESH, an acronym that outlines specific changes to your lifestyle: - F - Food. Ensure you eat a balanced diet rich in whole foods. - R - Rest. Ensure you are getting enough sleep to boost your overall health and immune function. Aim for at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night. - E - Exercise. Regular exercise can help support overall health and may have anti-inflammatory effects. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. - S - Stress control. Stress triggers eczema flare-ups, so it's essential to find ways to manage stress. - H - Habits. avoid habits that weaken your immune system and skin barrier. These may include scratching the skin, taking long, hot showers, using irritating and harsh products, not moisturizing, and wearing irritating clothing. Other general habits to break include smoking, excessive alcohol intake and more. How can I treat or calm eczema without steroids? The products we've selected will help you manage your eczema without steroids. However, if you have a severe flare-up or fail to get relief, your doctor may prescribe steroids or other prescription-only medications. What foods should I avoid if I have eczema? Foods to avoid if you have eczema are not clear-cut. Various people have reported that dairy, processed carbohydrates and nuts worsen their symptoms. Alcohol and cigarette use can also exacerbate symptoms. On the other hand, experts [recommend a diet](https://nationaleczema.org/blog/eczema-food-allergies/) rich in whole-natural foods, fruits and vegetables. If you have concerns about any foods, speak with your care team. What are your top do's and don'ts for managing eczema? These are Mokaya's suggested do's and don'ts for managing eczema: Do's: - Use gentle products and always keep your skin well-moisturized. - Identify and avoid triggers. If you don't know what your triggers are, you may need to keep a diary to track your symptoms and identify what triggers cause flare-ups. - Use a humidifier, especially during months when the air is cold and dry. - Practice stress management and try to learn new methods and techniques. Stress can trigger eczema flare-ups, so finding ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, yoga or deep breathing exercises, can be helpful. Don'ts: - Don't scratch; it increases inflammation and damages the skin barrier. - Don't use hot water or take long showers. And don't forget to moisturize after your shower. - Don't use harsh products. - Don't ignore your treatments or medication. Should I shower every day if I have eczema? You can shower every day as long as you do it right. A non-foaming wash, tepid water and a quick shower, followed by full body moisturizer, are better for eczema than long soaks in hot soapy water, which can strip your skin of its oils and worsen any redness or itching. Should I cover eczema or let it breathe? \"It really depends on the location and the nature of the eczema,\" says Mokaya. \"If it is the weepy kind, that would benefit from a dressing. But the dry, chronic kind is usually better left to breathe.\" How we choose the best products for eczema Skin care preferences and responses to products and ingredients often vary from person to person.
