Discover the answer in this article.", "sitename": "Spectrum Disorder", "date": "2022-03-07", "cleaned_text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects one's behavior toward others, communication, and cognitive ability. There is a wide range of symptoms of autism; that's why it's called a spectrum rather than a definitive set of symptoms. Early intervention is key to helping an autistic individual overcome the challenges and live a successful life. Parents with autistic children want to support healthy growth development. Luckily, [many types of treatment](https://spectrumdisorder.com/article/different-types-therapies-children-autism) help ease an autism symptom. The leading method is behavior therapy, applied by an applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapist. However, there are many others supporting therapies, such as nutritional therapy, [art therapy](https://spectrumdisorder.com/article/art-therapy-autism), and herbal medicine treatment. Keep in mind that a natural treatment should not be your primary method of helping ease autism symptoms. Yet some parents choose to use herbs and [supplements](https://spectrumdisorder.com/article/best-supplements-vitamins-autism) to support a child's health\u2014and you've wondered why. This article will talk about the healthy world of plant-based therapy for autism. Can Herbal Therapy Work for Children with Autism? The world of herbs for autism is divided. On one side, you have conventional western medicine. On the other side, you have alternative Chinese medicine. Those who follow herbal medicine treatments follow it with religious fervor, while medical professionals who support western medicine roll their eyes at such \"inventions.\" While some herbs improve behaviors and reduce an autism symptom in children with autism spectrum, the research surrounding the benefits of herbs is lacking. It's best to speak with a doctor about this before administering holistic medicine. However, you might feel awkward suggesting to your doctor an alternative type of treatment. Some might even sigh at your suggestion, but others might believe in a holistic approach. Talk to your child's doctor about the advantages and disadvantages of these natural remedies. Herbal supplements like garlic or chamomile can have potential benefits, but they should never replace traditional therapies. Is There Research about the Benefits of Herbs for Autism? Most parents are overly cautious about their children with autism spectrum disorder. Every treatment, especially herbal, should be researched carefully and run by experts who understand their child's specific symptoms. Let's talk a bit about the \"history\" of herbs for alleviating symptoms of autism. In 2015, [a review found](https://asatonline.org/for-parents/learn-more-about-specific-treatments/herbs-and-homeopathic-treatments/) that no studies focused on how people on the spectrum benefited from natural remedies. Herbs or essential oils could cause harmful side effects if used as unregulated treatments. It's important to know that a herb or a tincture could effectively alleviate an autism symptom but might cause new, problematic symptoms. Read Also: [Are Essential Oils Safe for Kids?](https://mommybabyorganics.com/article/are-essential-oils-safe-kids) After that report came out, more studies started to go out. A 2016 survey found that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a popular form of treatment for children and teenagers: almost 54% of participants use a form of CAM. The most common focus is on specialty diets or dietary supplements; plus, many people with autism use CAM to manage their symptoms. [Another German study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1362361318823545) found that 46% of parents with autistic children use at least one type of alternative medicine. However, most report that they use physical interventions like craniosacral therapy. 18% would be willing to try CAM in the future, but physical interventions were still the most common. Keep in mind that a positive herbal review: Is Not a Replacement for Traditional Care Alternative medicine is popular, whether going alongside ABA or replacing this type of therapy. However, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5448044/) show that natural treatments ARE NOT a replacement for traditional autism therapies. Herbs and supplements can help symptoms to some degree, but there is very little evidence that it actually works. Some natural remedies have potential, but they don't have conclusive results as applied behavior analysis. Some doctors, who believe in holistic medicine, might recommend adding certain natural elements into your child's treatment, mainly because it can't do any harm. However, even if there are some benefits (which we'll discuss later), doctors won't recommend replacing research-based therapies. Behavior Therapy Should Be the Main Form of Treatment Herbs, supplements, and other natural remedies provide much physical and mental support to an autistic child, but there's one thing you need to remember: autism is not curable. There is no known cure for autism\u2014it's a lifelong developmental condition. The only treatment is managing symptoms, so the autistic individual leads a \"normal\" life. Conventional autism treatments suggested by the pediatrician are evidence-based. They help the child with ASD learn new skills and manage behaviors. By replacing traditional therapy with natural remedies, it might be detrimental to your child's health. The Benefits of Plant-Based Therapy There is [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5448044/) that focuses on the positive benefits of herbal remedies. However, the person doing the study said that the scale of the research is small, while the range of herbal treatments is extensive. This particular study examined traditional Chinese medicine treatments for autism spectrum disorder. Many participants said they'd seen many good outcomes when using natural remedies alongside conventional treatment. No adverse effects were expected. Other studies support the idea that traditional Chinese medicine helped improve attention, problem-solving skills, and the ability to plan in children with autism. Another study done by the Japanese showed that 90% of the group reported improvements in behavioral symptoms for Asperger's patients. Ginkgo biloba also was proved to improve anti-inflammatory and cognitive skills in 47 children with ASD. Top Herbs That Help Improve Autism Symptoms After reading all of this, if you are still interested in supporting your child's health with holistic medicine alongside traditional treatments, here are some safe herbs for you to try: Chamomile Chamomile is often used in tea. It's a flower associated with anxiety and promoting sleep, but it also reduces inflammation and promotes healing. There are a few medical studies about chamomile's effectiveness, but there is evidence to support the idea that chamomile is a very calming herb. Echinacea This herb is commonly used to deal with colds, glue, and other infections. To some degree, it also promotes wound healing. Studies show that echinacea reduces how long a cold lasts, but none are conclusive. While evidence shows the herb can boost the immune system, it might be just a placebo effect. Garlic Garlic belongs in everyone's garden and kitchen, and there's no secret that it has many health benefits. Garlic helps lower cholesterol and blood pressure; plus, it has antimicrobial effects. Some might even say it has cancer prevention benefits too, but there's only a handful of medical studies. Ginseng Both a food and a health supplement, it can cure almost anything. However, the effect of ginseng is strong, so you shouldn't take it with anti-inflammatory medication or blood thinners as it can be dangerous. People with diabetes should not take ginseng either. However, ginseng can improve energy levels in some people. St. John's Wort This herbal supplement manages depression symptoms. If children with autism struggle with anxiety and depression, St. John's wort can alleviate these feelings. Be careful, though, because St. John's wort can increase sensitivity to sunlight, and it can also negate the effects of some prescription medications. Is Turmeric a Top Natural Remedy for Autism? Turmeric is well-known for its protective effects against neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. It's also reported to positively impact the treatment of autism since curcumin (the main active ingredient in turmeric) targets several cellular pathways. The effects of turmeric are: - Reduces inflammation - Counters the damage caused by heavy metals - Supports liver detoxification - Reduces stress and anxiety - Manages autism symptoms Bhandari & Kuhad, 2015, has studied turmeric and its efficacy in treating specific symptoms associated with autism. Promising findings and similar studies back this research. Turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties and may be one of the top natural remedies showing promise in managing autism symptoms. [Studies have found signs](https://guardian.ng/features/turmeric-green-tea-top-natural-remedies-for-autism/) of brain toxicity in induced autism animal models that curcumin can alleviate and improve abnormal brain weight and delayed maturation that is typically associated with autism. As a result, curcumin can be developed as a therapeutic drug that can manage autism symptoms and behaviors. Research also studies the possible link between iron deficiency anemia and the human ingestion of turmeric. This might concern parents with autistic children, especially when considering the iron and vitamin D deficiency common in individuals with autism than neurotypical people. In Conclusion Keep in mind that some of the studies are not conclusive, and most are based on results found on animals rather than humans. It's important to remember that this holistic medicine journey requires careful consideration. You should consult reputable resources and always ask your doctor (an expert) whether you should give your autistic child herbs or not. It might seem better because it's natural, but sometimes it might do more harm than good. "}
