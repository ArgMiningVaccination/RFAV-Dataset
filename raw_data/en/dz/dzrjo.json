One, in particular, is the detox. Now, detoxing is designed to push all of the bad stuff out of your body as you put some sort of good stuff in its place. Typically, detoxing consists of one or a few specific things. Some detox regimens only allow people to juice and intake their nutrients by drinking them. There are some that only allow soups; I've even heard of a cayenne pepper detox, which has cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and a couple other things in it. I've even done a detox that required me to drink a protein shake, 3 times a day, while only eating one meal. Again, the one thing they all have in common is that they regulate the body by causing it to get rid of toxins. Does Our Spirit Need a Spiritual Detox, Too? Speaking of a detox... what if we treated our spiritual bodies with a detox every now and again? I had this thought one day while scrolling through social media and seeing all of these [diets and fads](http://teamjesusmag.com/the-real-reason-a-diet-plan-will-never-help-you-lose-weight-feel-great/) on display. We partake in all kinds of diets, exercises, and detoxes to get this flesh right - what about what matters most, our spirits? Nope, I am definitely not implying that your [physical health](http://teamjesusmag.com/good-health-testimony-how-one-teammate-changed-her-diet-exercise-and-won/) is not important. In fact, our Playbook tells us that our bodies are temples of the Holy Ghost. \"What? Know ye not that your body is the temple o the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\" (1 Corinthians 6:19). But, I am saying that your spiritual health should be just as, if not more, important. We must include spiritual health in that \"self-care\" that we rave so much about, right? So, What's The Play Call? Often, we allow so much into our spirits without even realizing it. Spiritual toxins can be taken in by scrolling on social media, bad communication, no communication at all (and the thoughts that arise because of that), stressful environments (home, work, etc.), gossip, and all kinds of other ways. Just like we make it a point to release the \"bad stuff\" from our bodies, we must make a conscious effort to do the same for our spiritual health. Here are a few tips to help you perform a spiritual detox: - Choose your method of detox. Just as removing certain things from our diets is necessary for a physical detox, the same is true spiritually. And, there are times when our spiritual detox becomes physical, such as fasting. Matthew 17:21 says that \"Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.\" - Put more of the good stuff in. Read the Bible so that the Word of God can resonate in your spirit. So often, the things we see, hear, and take in around us affect our thoughts and attitude. Here are the ingredients for what to take in: \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\" Philippians 4:8 - It may seem as though this isn't a factor, but unforgiveness affects our spirits. When we hold grudges, we hold onto strife and anger that we have no business harboring. Also, when we refuse to forgive others, it causes us to be ineligible for the forgiveness of God. \"But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.\" Mark 11:26 \"Forbearing one another and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.\" Colossians 3:13 - Prayer is to the spirit, as exercise is to the body. Prayer keeps you going and refreshed, and so our Playbook tells us in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 to, \"Pray without ceasing.\" - Stay away from that bad stuff. The thing about a detox is that you cannot continue on with it forever. When the detox period is over, you've got to make a conscious effort to remain healthy. Our Playbook says in 1 Thessalonians 5:22 to \"Abstain from all appearance of evil.\" Toxic bondage is a choice - to which we must say \"No!\" \"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.\" Galatians 5:1 So, exercise your spirit, properly nourish it, and let go of all the bad stuff. Detoxing is necessary for every aspect of our lives and it's never too late to begin. Let's "}
