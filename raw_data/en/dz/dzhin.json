MYT has become a global community. As we grow, we need your input and feedback to make sure we stay true to our roots. You can always connect with us through conversation with our staff, \"I went to yoga and I was like, 'I can't do this!' Then when I go to get out of class I'm like springing up... happy girl! It's made a huge difference. I think everyone, if they can sign up for yoga, they should sign up!\" - Ursula Maunder - MYT Member We want you to feel as happy and empowered as Ursula! We believe yoga, live classes, and human connection has the power to transform the world - one person at a time. Right now, we're in an epidemic of stress, isolation, and loneliness. Human connection can help people overcome life's biggest challenges. So it is more important than ever to use technology to create deep and meaningful connections. Yoga provides a natural way to solve so many problems. It can give you (and most people) good health, happiness, and spiritual well-being. Yoga has been used to help with physical and mental health for thousands of years. If you're struggling with your mental health, physical pain, or just need a way to wind down - we're here to help. If you want to feel better in your body, stronger, more flexible - we're here to help. Most of all, MyYogaTeacher is a place for all of us to grow together! At [MyYogaTeacher](https://www.myyogateacher.com/) we take our values very seriously in order to benefit not only our members, but everyone involved here at MYT. We strive to incorporate our mission and values in our everyday actions. One of our main values is the health and happiness of the students. We try to achieve this through thoughtfully listening to your feedback and implementing it to the best of our abilities. We also value personal growth - physically, mentally, emotionally, or even healing. We try to offer classes that would most optimize all of those things for the students. This would include Yoga For Stress & Anxiety, Yoga for Boosting Immunity, Yoga for Healthy Hair & Skin, and many more. Not only does this include mental health but physical health as well. A few examples of what we can offer for healing would include Yoga for Back Health, Yoga for Weight Loss, Therapeutic Yoga For Thyroid, and many others. We hope that through these classes it can help our students grow in all aspects of themselves. Our belief is that my own personal evolution can make the world a better place. Our values are what strives us to do what we do here at [MyYogaTeacher](https://www.myyogateacher.com/yoga-online-classes/).
