Blumberg Institute are the nation's leading nonprofit disease advocacy and research organizations dedicated to finding a cure and improving the quality of life for those affected by hepatitis B worldwide. The Hepatitis B Foundation was founded in 1991 and established the Blumberg Institute in 2003 to fulfill its research mission. Leading the Way to 2030For nearly three decades, the Hepatitis B Foundation and our research arm, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, have been leading the charge to bring hepatitis B outreach, research and advocacy to the forefront. We have adopted a bold strategy to give a louder voice to this silent epidemic\u2014 bringing it into the spotlight to elevate awareness, increase vaccination, screening and linkage to care, accelerate research, and ultimately cure this deadly disease. Our five-year strategic plan, approved in 2018, is rooted in an aggressive vision: BY 2030, NO ONE DIES FROM HEPATITIS B. We are conFident that a cure For hepatitis B is Within our reach, and we are recruiting the best scientists in the field to encourage collaboration, share their progress, and bring a cure to market. We recognize, however, that a cure alone is not enough for our vision. Our plan also includes continuing and expanding our existing programs to emphasize prevention, and provide critical assistance for those managing the disease. Through our Hep B United program, we have set the standard for building coalitions within at-risk communities to provide free awareness, testing, and linkage to care. We have implemented a ground-breaking global initiative in Haimen City, China, that will act as a model as we expand into other highly-affected regions of the world. And we continue to provide information and guidance directly to thousands of people who contact us for help each year. y our commitment to our mission has made all these programs possible, and your continued support will bring us even closer to our vision of a world where hepatitis B is no longer deadly. Fifty years after its discovery, hepatitis B is still the most common liver disease in the world. It thrives in silence, but our voices together can make hepatitis B history. We have a clear plan in place to lead hepatitis B into the forefront of scientific advances and public health planning, and eliminate deaths from this virus within our lifetimes. y our continued support has made these advances possible. 2018 Annu Al Repo Rt3 through our research arm, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, we are relentlessly researching promising new innovative treatments for liver cancer and a cure for hepatitis B. Nearly 50 scientists work at our Blumberg Institute\u2014one of the largest nonprofit groups of researchers investigating hepatitis B, liver cancer, and other liver diseases in the world. Our work extends beyond our own laboratories, to the larger hepatitis B research community. In 2018, our roadmap to a cure was published in Hepatology, providing a consensus statement from leading researchers to identify the most promising areas of focus for hepatitis B and liver cancer science, and approaches considered necessary for a cure. We expect more oF our discoveries, and discoveries that we inspire, to reach human trials soon. Our successes from the past year are highlighted in this report. reaching clinical trials 4 of our promising findings moved into clinical trials in 2018, including two for hepatitis B treatment, one for cancer treatment and one for cancer detection reaching the scientific community Our Scientists published 40 peer-reviewed publications in leading research journals scientiFic research Leading the way to A CuRE Keeping a focus on drug discovery and the basic science of disease, we have: Identified compounds with novel activity against HBsAg Identified new biomarker to detect liver cirrhosis and liver cancers Identified a novel compound, KPD10, through our cell-based high- throughput compound screening, which selectively kills HCC cells expressing HBV surface antigen Found method of selective killing of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by exploiting HBV surface antigen expressed on HCC cells For use as a new, non-invasive marker of HCC, identified HBV sequences integrated adjacent to cell oncogenes from the urine of people with HCC Identified cellular proteins that HBV needs to produce cccDNA and to repress cccDNA expression Discovered HBV's unusual process of producing its \"mRNA\" Found STING agonist as therapeutics for cancers and chronic viral infectious diseases Identified and characterized antiviral drug candidate against yellow fever virus, with a new mechanism of action see hepb.org/research for more information on our research accomplishments.

Information is available in 3 languages, and we have connected with 500 individuals for consults, and reached 3,000 people through our educational webinars. visit www.hepDconnect.org . Liver Cancer Connect works to educate those at risk for liver cancer and provides support through its email helpline and social media channels for patients and families. visit www.livercancerconnect.org. outreach & patient education Leading the way to BETTER HEALTHhepatitis B can Be an overwhelming and confusing diagnosis. Our trained staff answer questions about test results, transmission, vaccinations, and care, and help patients to understand what their diagnosis means for their health and their future. We guide people with hepatitis B as they face their diagnosis, and provide guidance for telling loved ones, finding care, and starting a family. This year, we educated patients, family members, employers and health officials through: national storytelling campaign shines a spotlight on hepatitis B There is no better way to raise public understanding about the true impact of hepatitis B than through personal stories. In 2017, the Hepatitis B Foundation unveiled its #justB national storytelling campaign with real people sharing their stories about hepatitis B. This national storybank is designed to put a human face on hepatitis B in order to increase public awareness, decrease stigma and discrimination, and to promote testing and treatment, which will ultimately save lives. Forty storytellers share their experiences with hepatitis B and liver cancer both online, and at in-person educational events throughout the U.S. Over 2.2 million people have viewed our stories, improving awareness around the world. you can watch all our #justB stories at www.hepb.org/justb. 9,953 consultations via phone, email, and social media 1.8 million visits to our website, representing over 200 countries 12 Updated website chapters in 12 languages In 2018, we started collecting caller data from phone consults. 35% 30% 17% 11% 10% 10%test results vaccine info a doctor newly diagnosed possible exposuretransmissionOur callers asked about: 2018 Annu Al Repo Rt6 puBlic health Leading the way to ELIMINATIN g HEPATITIS Bto reach our goal of reducing deaths from hepatitis B, the Hepatitis B Foundation issued a formal recommendation this year that all Americans be tested for hepatitis B. To bring the disease to the forefront, we must be aggressive in our efforts to test, vaccinate, treat, and prevent the spread of hepatitis B. But we can't stop there. We will continue to build new coalitions, and support existing efforts to ensure that every infected person knows their status and has access to care that can save their life. hep B united Hep B United, a national coalition established by HBF in partnership with the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, has demonstrated great success in bringing community leaders, providers, medical and public health students, and state and local health departments together with at-risk communities. Hep B United added 4 new partners this year bringing our reach to 30 cities in 21 states. Hep B United brought over 80 of our coalition partners together for its 6th Annual National Summit to advance our movement to address and eliminate hepatitis B. The Hepatitis B Foundation also facilitates our local coalition, Hep B United Philadelphia (HBUP), which serves a vital role as a mentor for newly-formed coalitions in other cities, and as a testing ground for new programs. Cities States 3021 In 2018, Hep B United Philadelphia educated over 2,000 people, screened 150, and linked 90% of infected individuals to care. We also hosted professional trainings for over 150 clinicians and public health partners.

Building on our success in China, we have partnered with organizations to help them bring hepatitis B awareness, testing and care in Ho-Chi Minh, Vietnam and Accra, Ghana. coalition against hepatitis in people oF aFrican origin HBF leads the national Coalition Against Hepatitis in People of African Origin (CHIPO), a community coalition of organizations to address the high rates of hepatitis B infection among African communities in the U.S. This year, our work included a collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to create a broad scale educational initiative to promote hepatitis B awareness and testing for African immigrants across the United States. This exciting project is the first of its kind to provide targeted educational materials to often-overlooked African immigrant communities. 2018 Annu Al Repo Rt8 8through our eFForts, the hepatitis B voice has grown steadily louder in Washington, DC. As the recognized authority on the fight against hepatitis B, The Hepatitis B Foundation has led the charge to bring government attention and funding to the epidemic of viral hepatitis. We have also worked to fight persistent discrimination that people with hepatitis B face as they apply to work, go to school, enlist in the military, and seek healthcare. advocacy Leading the way by TAkINg A CTION 2018 Annu Al Repo Rt9 hep B cure campaign Hepatitis B has long been underfunded in contrast to government spending on similar epidemics. The Hepatitis B Foundation has focused our efforts on a major advocacy campaign, the Hep B Cure Campaign, aimed to double federal spending on hepatitis B. Our Cure Campaign has already seen success with publication of our Roadmap for a Cure, which identifies areas of promising research and funding. We are working to continue our efforts to increase funding for research by $39 million a year for the next six years, and are advocating for better coordination of research through the National Institutes of Health. hep B united advocacy day Bring the message to Washington During the Hep B United Advocacy Day, nearly 70 advocates met with more than 60 Congressional offices to discuss increasing federal resources to address and eliminate hepatitis B and liver cancer. We also now reach over 430 people through our online grassroots advocacy network, at hepbunited.org. Fighting discrimination in the u.s. The Hepatitis B Foundation is working tirelessly to end the stigma and ensure that people with hepatitis B are afforded the same opportunities as everyone else. Our advocacy successfully made hepatitis B a protected condition under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States, and we continue to fight to ensure that people receive those protections. In addition to ensuring that medical schools and employers comply with ADA protections, we are also fighting for fair access to medicines. Learn more about our work at hepb.org/rights .

In 2018, we adopted an ambitious five-year plan based around the vision that by 2030, no one dies of hepatitis B. Our Roadmap to Cure provides a blueprint for the research necessary to bring better treatments and a cure, and our public health priorities support the education, awareness and infrastructure needed to stop the spread of the virus. achieving our vision Will require a gloBal Focus to expand our resources and capaBilities across the World in order to \u00bb 2018 Annu Al Repo Rt11 create a patient v oice Our presence in communities of high prevalence must increase. Education, awareness, and advocacy on behalf of individuals fighting discrimination and stigma is underway, but we know there are many more cases of people suffering from workplace, military, and educational access discrimination. Working with our coalition of partners across the country, we can help them scale up efforts in over 20 states. improve international capacity Internationally, resources are scattered and uncoordinated. But the Hepatitis B Foundation is poised, as the global leader in this space, to take on the challenge and build an international coalition similar to the United States Hep B United model, resulting in \"Hep B United Global\" or \"HBUG\". This will lay the groundwork for projects in 5 different countries around the globe to save millions of lives. Foster discovery of a cure for hepatitis B We need to give the scientists of the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute the tools to conduct cutting edge research. Vision, commitment and patience is required to accelerate the pace toward a \"functional\" cure, which we believe exists somewhere within the new wave of HBV therapeutics. 2018 Annu Al Repo Rt12 The Hepatitis B Foundation's valuable research and programs are made possible by the commitment of our donors. We are grateful to every individual and organization that has generously supported our mission to find a cure and improve the quality of life for those affected by hepatitis B.
