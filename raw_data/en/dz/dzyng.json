This master plan provides an opportunity to ensure our resources and amenities closely align with our pursuit of academic excellence. We are always looking to improve our operations and experiences for the students, faculty and staff who call UCF home. In addition to innovative classrooms and research facilities, this plan includes our commitment to conservation, smart transportation and public safety - our No. 1 priority for everyone on our campus. At UCF, we like to say that we are \"of\" our community, not just \"in\" it. That means working together to create a campus that best serves our region and the state. I look forward to our continued work toward this shared mission. Dr. Thad Seymour, Jr. Interim President UCF MAIN CAMPUS History of UCF UCF was founded as \"Florida Technological University\" in 1963. It was created to support the growing technological industries in Central Florida, primarily those related to engineering and space. When it opened, the school provided other academic programs to give the students a broad-based education. Re-named in the late 1970s, the \"University of Central Florida,\" has become a rapidly-growing, leading re search university, with a full complement of undergraduate and graduate programs. Cutting-edge research is performed in a wide variety of disciplines that span the academic spectrum. UCF Now A 21st Century University The University of Central Florida is a thriving university located in metropolitan Orlando. With more than 68,000 students, UCF is one of the largest universities in the U.S. In addition to its impressive size, UCF is ranked as a best-value university by Kiplinger, and as one of the nation's most affordable colleges by Forbes . UCF benefits from a diverse faculty and staff who create a welcoming environment and provide opportunities for all students to grow, learn, and succeed. A Foundation for Success UCF and its 13 colleges offer more than 220 academic degrees. The Main Campus is 13 miles east of downtown Orlando and is adjacent 1.0 INTRODUCTION 2 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO 1 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) totals are based on 40 undergraduate annual student credit hours and 32 graduate student credit hours produced in live course sections (non-Web) on the UCF Main Campus, for fundable and non-fundable student credit hours. 2 Headcounts (HC) represent the number of students taking one or more live course sections (non-Web) on the UCF Main Campus, for fundable and non-fundable students. 3 2015-25 Campus Master Plan Update, 2.2 Academic Program Element. 4 UCF Institutional Knowledge Management. to Central Florida Research Park, one of the top research parks in the nation. UCF's fully online programs include bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, PhDs, certificates, and more. Top-Ranked College Education UCF is a leader in many academic and research fields, including optics and lasers, modeling and simulation, engineering and computer science, business administration, education, hospitality management, health care, and video game design. As of May 2019, UCF has awarded more than 335,000 degrees since classes began in 1968. Knight Life Home to Spectrum Stadium and the Additions Arena, UCF hosts a variety of concerts and shows, plus NCAA sports and cultural events. Student housing is abundant, as are on-campus events and activities. UCF offers an array of student services and academic resources to help students succeed, and recognizes hundreds of student clubs and organizations. UCF Enrollment UCF has not yet developed its projected enrollment vision for the 10-year planning timeframe, 2020 to 2030. In Spring 2019, Interim UCF President Thad Seymour charged a strategic enrollment task force with investigating and proposing projected enrollment over the next decade. Their report is to be completed in Fall 2019. Figure 1.0-1 Main Campus Enrollment This figure indicates Main Campus enrollment when the 2015-25 and 2020-30 Campus Master Plans (CMP) were prepared. Academic Year Annual FTE1 Fall Headcount CMP Elements The Housing and Transportation elements rely on enrollment growth projections to meet the Data & Analysis requirements of Board of Governors Chapter 21. In the absence of projected enrollment data, these elements will follow other strategies as described below: Housing Growth Strategy BOG Chapter 21 states that the Housing element \"ensures the provision of ... housing facilities... adequate to meet the needs of the projected university enrollment .\" 1.0 INTRODUCTION 3 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO 5 BEBR \"Projections of Florida Population by County, 2020-2045, with Estimates for 2018\" The 2015-25 Campus Master Plan indicated a bed deficit that remains unaddressed because no beds have been added to the Main Campus during the intervening five years and enrollment has increased. During the 10-year planning timeframe, UCF will work to correct the housing deficit identified in the 2015-25 Campus Master Plan and confirmed in the 2020-30 Campus Master Plan (see 3.0 HOUSING, Data & Analysis, Figure 3.0-2). Transportation Growth Strategy Element 6.0 TRANSPORTATION a nalyzes UCF's impact on our Host Local Government's transportation infrastructure. In previous years, UCF's consulting transportation engineers have used projected enrollment to determine future traffic volumes. This year , VHB Engineering will use the following methodology to predict growth: Comparing traffic counts entering/exiting the Main Campus - The traffic volumes decreased between 2014 (83,551) and 2019 (76,620). This represents a negative traffic growth rate of -0.81%. Comparing anticipated population growth in Orange County - The Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR) 5 projects population growth in Orange County will be 0.88% per year between 2018 and 2030. Therefore, when a negative growth rate is anticipated, VHB has used a minimum traffic growth rate of 1% per year, as required by Orange County on similar traffic studies. How big is the UCF Main Campus? The DEP Land Document System ( BTLDS ) shows that the UCF Main Campus is made up of two large parcels of land, totaling 1,420.3225 acres, as follows: Parcel 1 : The historic Main Campus was transferred in 1967 from the Florida Board of Education to the Florida Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund (TIITF), for use by Florida Technological University , later renamed University of Central Florida. In January 1974, the TIITF leased 1203.0525 acres to the Florida Board of Regents, also known as the \"UCF Parent Lease #2721.\" Park, 2912 Percival Road South: Central Florida Research Park Parcel 2: The \"Eastern Parcel\" (aka 2912 Percival Road) was acquired by the TIITF in February 1994. When this undeveloped parcel was leased to UCF in 2007, it was 217.27 acres. 1.0 INTRODUCTION 4 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO 6 Property records and maps maintained by OCPA do not concur on acreage; but show the two parcels to be 1,180.902 acres and 217.18 acres. UCF is working with OCPA to resolve the acreage issue, by adding back easements and leases that were excluded from the UCF campus acreage. 7 A future easement along Alafaya Trail will be granted to FDOT in 2020 to allow improvements to pedestrian safety, including a new, wider sidewalk, safety barricades, and lighting. 8 The original lease overlapped with one of the pond parcels included in Easement 28329 UCF has been working recently with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) to confirm the Main Campus acreage and easements; and with the Orange County Property Assessor (OCPA) to ensure that their Interactive Map and Property Records reflect the correct acreage for each parcel. 6 See element 2.0 Future Land Use & Urban Design, Figure 2.0-1 Current Land Utilization Table, showing how many acres of campus are considered developed, developable, or undevelopable. Figure 1.0-2 Easements and Leases along the UCF boundaries The following easements and leases are along UCF's west and north borders. These easements and leases reduce developable land, but do not reduce the campus acreage.

College of Graduate Studies (CGS) In 2016, the Office of Graduate Studies and the Office of Research and Commercialization were merged to amplify the impact in graduate education and research programs, grow graduate student enrollment, and increase research funding. College of Health Professions and Sciences (CHPS) In 2018, the new College of Health Professions and Sciences became part of the newly-created Academic Health Sciences Center, along with the College of Medicine and College of Nursing. It will unify UCF's health-related programs. College of Community Innovation and Education (CCIE) Also in 2018, the College of Community Innovation and Education was created to focus on the pillars of thriving, modern cities, such as civic engagement and governing, safety and justice, and health and well-being, all of which are grounded in transformative education. CAMPUS MASTER PLANNING History of the UCF Campus Master Plan 2020 is the 25th anniversary of the UCF Campus Master Plan! The UCF 1995-2005 Campus Master Plan (CMP) was the first to be prepared by statutory requirement. Subsequent \"Campus Master Plan Updates\" were prepared for the planning periods 2000-10, 2005-15, 2010-20, and 2015-25. These \"Updates\" did not constitute a major departure from the CMP adopted in 1995. Purpose and Intent of the UCF Campus Master Plan The purpose and intent of the UCF Campus Master Plan (CMP) is threefold: 1. Growth Management - planning for future campus development and growth 2. Ensuring Compatibility with the surrounding community (context area) 3. Concurrency Management 1.0 INTRODUCTION 6 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO 9 Orange County, FL - Concurrency Management Context Area BOG Regulation 21.201 defines context area as the area surrounding a university within which on-campus development may impact local public facilities and services and natural resources, and within which off-campus development may impact university resources and facilities. See Figure 1.0-3 Context Area Map, at the end of this chapter. The extent of the UCF context area is considered to be: North of Campus (Seminole County) to just north of the Little Econlockhatchee River East of Campus (Orange County) to just east of Tanner Road South of Campus (Orange County) to just south of East Colonial Drive (SR 50) West of Campus (Orange County) to just west of Rouse Road Jurisdiction of the UCF Campus Master Plan The UCF Campus Master Plan applies only to the UCF Main Campus. All satellite campuses are subject to the Comprehensive Plans of the governments in which they are located. Concurrency Concurrency requires that public facilities and services needed to support development be available concurrent with the impacts of that development. Statewide Concurrency Requirements In accordance with Florida Statute 163.3180 Concurrency, the only public facilities and services subject to the statewide concurrency requirements are: Sanitary Sewer Solid Waste Drainage Potable Water Local Government Concurrency Requirements Per the concurrency statute, \"additional public facilities and services may not be made subject to concurrency on a statewide basis without appropriate study and approval by the Legislature; however, any local government may extend the concurrency requirement so that it applies to additional public facilities within its jurisdiction.\" o Orange County Concurrency Orange County facilities and services subject to concurrency requirements include:9 Roads and Mass Transit Utilities, including Water, Wastewater, and Stormwater Solid Waste Schools Parks o UCF Concurrency UCF extends the concu rrency requirement to these facilities and services: Chilled Water Primary Electric Power Natural Gas 1.0 INTRODUCTION 7 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO Stormwater Statutes and Regulations Campus Master Plans are required by Florida Statute and the State University System Board of Governors Regulations. Florida Statute 1013.30 Campus Master Plans and Campus Development Agreements recognizes a unique relationship between university campuses and their host governments. Campus master plans and associated campus development agreements are intended to address this relationship and foster communication between universities and their host local governments. University campuses provide research and educational benefits of statewide and national importance, and further provide substantial educational, economic, and cultural benefits to their host local governments. But, they may also have an adverse impact on the public facilities, services, and natural resources of host governments. Link: Florida Statute 1013.30 Florida Board of Governors (BOG) regulation Chapter 21 Campus Master Plans provides further clarification of the required elements and review process. Link: BOG Chapter 21 By statute and regulation, each Campus Master Plan (CMP) shall cover a period of at least 10 years and not more than 20 years. UCF has always designated a planning timeframe of 10 years. The CMP is updated every 5 years, and adopted by the UCF Board of Trustees in November of the year prior to the beginning of the planning period. Reviews Internal review Prior to publication of the first draft, the CMP is submitted for internal review to the: University Leadership University Master Planning Committee University General Counsel CMP Element Leaders and Advisory Resources Statutory Review Florida Statue 1013.30(6) requires that the draft master plan be sent for review to the host and any affected local governments, the state land planning agency, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Transportation, the Department of State, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and the applicable water management district and regional planning council. UCF submits the draft CMP electronically to the following agencies, as required by statute: o Orange County (host local government) o Seminole County (affected local government) o City of Orlando (affected local government) 1.0 INTRODUCTION 8 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO o City of Oviedo (affected local government) o Florida Department of Ec onomic Opportunity (DEO) o Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) o Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) o Florida Department of State o Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission o St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) o East Central Florida Regional Planning Council (ECFRPC) A printed copy is placed in the John C. Hitt Library. An electronic copy is posted on the UCF Facilities Planning and Construction department's website: fp.ucf.edu Florida Statute 1013.30 (6) states that the \"agencies must be given 90 days in which to conduct their review and provide comments to the university board of trustees.\" Commencement of the review period is well-advertised to ensure public participation in the planning process. Public Review To ensure full public participation in the campus planning process, UCF bases the public comment period on the time allotted to the reviewing agencies. The public is also invited to speak at the meetings, and provide comments by email or US mail. Courtesy Review An invitation to review was also sent electronically to the District 5 Orange County Commissioner and to MetroPlan Orlando. Adoption Following the first two statutory meetings, and receipt and consideration of all review comments, the Board of Trustees may adopt the CMP at the Third Public Hearing. Master Plan Elements Required CMP Elements Florida Statute and Board of Governors Regulations require that the Campus Master Plan include eight (8) elements: Future Land Use Housing Recreation and Open Space Intergovernmental Coordination Conservation General Infrastructure Transportation Capital Improvements Optional CMP Elements Optional elements are permitted under BOG 21.212, but are not subject to review under Chapter 21. In past CMP Updates, UCF included nine (9) optional elements to address academic mission, academic programs, urban design, utilities, academic facilities, support facilities, architectural design guidelines, landscape design guidelines, and facilities maintenance. CMP Format 1.0 INTRODUCTION 9 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO Goals, Objectives, and Policies (GOP) Each element will contain Goals, Objectives, and Policies (GOP) as defined in BOG Regulation 21.201. GOALS are the long-term end toward which programs or activities are ultimately directed. OBJECTIVES are a specific, measurable, intermediate end that is achievable and marks progress toward a goal. POLICIES are the way in which programs and activities are conducted to achieve an identified goal. Data & Analysis (D&A) Each required element will contain Data & Analysis (D&A) that supports any conclusions or recommendations. Optional Elements may also include D&A. Goals, objectives, policies, standards, findings, and conclusions must be based on data. Data must originate from professionally-accepted sources (best available existing data). Tables, charts, graphs, maps, figures, sources, and their limitations must be clearly described. Maps & Tables The following maps and tables are required by the Board of Governors regulations, but UCF provides many others. Future Land Use Map, per BOG 21.204 Transportation Element Maps/Tables per BOG 21.205 Housing Element Maps, per BOG 21.206 General Infrastructure Maps, per BOG 21.207 Conservation Element Map, per BOG 21.208 Recreation & Open Space Map, per BOG 21.209, aka Athletics, Recreation & Open Space Map A capital improvements schedule, per BOG 21.211, aka UCF 10-Year Schedule of Capital Projects (SCP) What's New?

When elements have been combined, UCF has provided an explanation as required by BOG 21.202(1)(b) Retired four (4) elements: Academic Mission, Academic Programs, Architectural Design Guidelines, and Landscape Design Guidelines The UCF 2020-30 Elements 1.0 INTRODUCTION The INTRODUCTION is not an element, but an over-arching view of the University, its planning process, changes and improvements to the 2020-30 Campus Master Plan Update, and a snapshot of the University administration at the time of adoption. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN The FUTURE LAND USE element is required by F.S. 1013.30 and BOG 21.204. 1.0 INTRODUCTION 10 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO 10 Precedent: The Florida Gulf Cost University 2015-25 Campus Master Plan includes the element \"Recreation, Athletics and Open Space.\" 11 Precedent: The University of Florida 2015-25 Campus Master Plan includes the element \"Public Safety.\" 12 Precedent: The University of Florida 2015-25 Campus Master Plan includes the element \"Implementation.\" Combined Elements The University of Central Florida cannot consider future land uses in the absence of urban design principles, or vice versa, therefore FUTURE LAND USE has been combined with the optional element, URBAN DESIGN. 3.0 HOUSING The HOUSING element is required by F.S. 1013.30 and BOG 21.206. 4.0 ATHLETICS, RECREATION & OPEN SPACE The RECREATION & OPEN SPACE element is required by F.S. 1013.30 and BOG 21.209. Athletics has always been a component of this element; and this year UCF has elected to add Athletics to the element name.10 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES The GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE element (stormwater, sanitary sewer, potable water, solid waste) is required by F.S. 1013.30 and BOG 21.207. Combined Elements As UCF must consider its complex infrastructure in its entirety, GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE has been combined with the optional element, UTILITIES (chilled water, electrical power, natural gas, and telecommunications). 6.0 TRANSPORTATION The TRANSPORTATION element is required by F.S. 1013.30 and BOG 21.205. 7.0 INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION The INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINA TION element is required by F.S. 1013.30 and BOG 21.210. 8.0 PUBLIC SAFETY11 UCF has introduced a new element, PUBLIC SAFETY. The purpose of this new element is to set goals to ensure the protection of students, faculty, staff, and visitors against threats and dangers to their well-being. 9.0 CONSERVATION The CONSERVATION element is required by F.S. 1013.30 and BOG 21.208. The element includes the conservation of both natural resources and energy. 10.0 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS & IMPLEMENTATION12 The CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS element is required by F.S. 1013.30 and BOG 21.211. 1.0 INTRODUCTION 11 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO Combined Elements UCF has combined the CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS element with a new element, IMPLEMENTATION, which documents the steps taken to carry a capital improvement project from \"Ideation to Construction,\" and clarifies the roles of various departments and committees in campus and capital planning. 11.0 ACADEMIC & SUPPORT FACILITIES The ACADEMIC & SUPPORT FACILITIES element is optional. Combined Elements UCF has combined ACADEMIC FACILITIES and SUPPORT FACILITIES, two optional elements from previous CMP updates. 12.0 FACILITIES MAINTENANCE The FACILITIES MAINTENANCE element is optional. EVALUATION & APPRAISAL REPORT (EAR) Every 5 years, the University submits an EVALUATION & APPRAISAL REPORT (EAR) to the Board of Trustees. The EAR is a section of the Campus Master Plan required by BOG 21.202. The purpose of the EAR is to evaluate the previous master plan, and: List which goals, objectives and policies have been successfully reached; Identify the need for new or modified goals, objectives, or policies to correct unanticipated and unforeseen problems and opportunities that have occurred since adoption of the campus master plan; and Identify proposed and anticipated plan amendments necessary to address identified problems and opportunities. The EAR for the 2015-25 Campus Master Plan will be submitted with the 2020-30 Campus Master Plan Update. SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability was considered for inclusion as a new element in the 2020-30 CMP, but the UCF Sustainability Initiatives department determined that sustainability touches every element , and therefore sustainability has been addressed throughout the Campus Master Plan. Next steps Campus Development Agreement (CDA) Upon adoption of the 2020-30 CMP by the UCF Board of Trustees, the University will negotiate a Campus Development Agreement (CDA) with Orange County, the host local government. The purpose of the CDA is to identify and help mitigate the University's impact on public services. The CDA outlines specific Partnership Projects between Orange County and UCF to lessen or eliminate deficiencies identified in the Campus Master Plan; and identifies UCF's \"fair share\" of the cost of all necessary improvements. 1.0 INTRODUCTION 12 of 16 | 1.0 INTRO The UCF Board of Trustees is responsible for paying UCF's fair share for the measures agreed upon in the CDA. The last CDA, dated November 29, 2016, outlined the following projects and identified UCF's fair share and deadlines for completion: Partner with Orange County on Pedestrian Safety projects Develop and implement a Campus Wayfinding Plan Develop an on-campus bicycle pathway through the UCF Campus, linking existing trail systems of Orange and Seminole Counties Conduct a study regarding on-campus housing or additional online courses Jointly evaluate the operability and compatibility of the County's and UCF's traffic control systems Work in partnership to secure state funds for concurrency Jointly perform annual traffic counts on specific backlogged roads WHO'S WHO at UCF?

Therefore, UCF has combined these two related elements. FUTURE LAND USE addresses the long-range vision for land use on campus in coordination with future land use plans of the host and/or affected local governments. URBAN DESIGN is the process by which UCF shapes the physical features of campus to provide a quality campus experience. It addresses the character of the University and the unified vision for future campus development, such as building groupings, patterns of streets and sidewalks, and features of public spaces. The ultimate goal is to create urban areas that are attractive, functional, and sustainable. The University's commitment to sustainability and the protection of the environment is evident throughout this element. The original 1995-2000 Campus Master Plan established the academic core as a pedestrian-friendly environment. As development continues, the University will continue to preserve natural lands through careful consideration of developmental densities and adjacent lands. RELATED ELEMENTS See 4.0 ATHLETICS, RECREATION & OPEN SPACE for information on activity-based recreation, resource-based recreation, and open space. See 9.0 CONSERVATION regarding UCF's commitment to maintain conservation lands. See 10.0 CAPITAL IMPROVEMEN TS & IMPLEMENTATION for capital projects projected for the campus within the 10-year planning time frame. STATUTE & REGULATION 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN is a combined element. Combining related elements is permitted under BOG 21.202(1)(b); which states that \"the campus master plan shall contain an explanation of such combinations. See 1.0 INTRODUCTION for the explanations of combined elements. The Future Land Use Element is required by Florida Statue 1013.30(3). The element must follow the guidelines stated in Florida Board of Governors (BOG) Regulations, Chapter 21. BOG 21.204 states the purpose of the element as follows: \"This element designates existing and future development as reflected in the goals, objectives and policies of the campus master plan, and describes how future development will be 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 2 of 29 | 2.0 INTRO coordinated with land uses planned by the host and/or affected local governments in the planning study area.\" Urban Design is an optional element. Optional elements are permitted under BOG 21.212, but are not subject to review under Chapter 21. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 3 of 29 | 2.0 GOP 2.1 FUTURE LAND USE NARRATIVE The Future Land Use Element sets forth the existing and future land use patterns at the University of Central Florida. This element addresses how land use patterns correlate to those planned by the host and affected local governments in the planning study area. Future Land Use on the UCF Campus shall be consistent with this Campus Master Plan, and the master plans of the Host Local Government 1 and the affected local governments. The 2010-2030 Orange County Future Land Use Map, designates only four (4) land use categories for the UCF Main Campus. They are: Institutional, Conservation, Water Body, and Industrial (the Eastern Reserve). Link: Orange County, Florida Future Land Use Map The Board of Governors allows universities the option of using either the land uses established in their host local government's comprehensive plan or using their own land use categories. UCF has established its own land use categories delineated in Figure 2.0-1 Future Land Use Map, along with standards of use for each: Academic Use (includes Research Use) Support Use Residential Use Utility Use Parking Use Mixed Use Athletics, Recreation & Open Space Use Conservation Use - Conservation Easements, Wetlands, and Uplands2 Lakes - natural and man-made (stormwater retention) GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES GOAL 1: To create developmental patterns that direct future growth to appropriate areas on campus, promote the educational mission of the Un iversity, protect environmentally-sensitive areas, and ensu re compatibility with the community. OBJECTIVE 1.1: The Campus Master Plan shall define Future Land Use POLICY 1.1.1: The University shall designate Future Land Use categories (See Figure 2.0-1 Future Land Use Map. 1 UCF's host local government is Orange County, and the affected local governments are Seminole County, Orlando, and Oviedo. 2 Riparian buffers are included in the conservation areas on Figure 2.0-1 Future Land Use Map, and delineated around the borders of areas in Figure 9.0-1 Conservation Map (see 9.0 CONSERVATION). 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 4 of 29 | 2.0 GOP Categories and related density/intensity of use. An explanation of each land use category, and the associated standards for density/intensity of use, including the Floor Area Ratio (FAR), are designated below. Academic Land Use The Academic Land Use category supports academic and research uses and is largely concentrated within the Academic Core of campus. For clarity, it may also be referred to as the Academic/Research category. This category includes buildings with classroom, research, and office spaces for faculty, staff, and administration that support academics. The Academic Land Use classification identifies campus areas where topography, adjacent land uses, existing space utilization, utility locations, proximity to multimodal transportation systems, and existing development patterns will support academic and research facilities. The higher Floor Area Ratio (FAR) allowed within the Academic category concentrates existing and emerging academic and research facilities within reasonable walking distance to classes, and facilitates the cohesive functioning of academic units. Density/Intensity: target FAR 3.0 Support Land Use The Support Land Use category identifies campus areas where topography, soil conditions, adjacent land uses, existing space utilization, and existing development patterns are appropriate for administrative, student support, facilities support, and similar nonacademic support spaces. Careful planning allows support facilities to be within, or immediately adjacent to, academic/research and housing areas. Density/Intensity: target FAR 1.0 Residential Land Use The Residential Land Use category identifies campus areas where topography, soil conditions, adjacent land uses, existing space utilization, and existing development patterns are appropriate for housing development. Future Residential Land Use will be promoted outside of the academic core to encourage students to walk to the academic core. Density/Intensity: target 57.2 to 125 beds per acre Utility Land Use The Utility Land Use category identifies campus areas where topography, soil conditions, adjacent land uses, and existing and proposed development patterns, are appropriate for utility development and telecommunications facilities, and can best serve the existing and projected demands for facilities on campus. Density/Intensity: target FAR 1.0 Parking Land Use The Parking Land Use category identifies campus areas where parking lots or parking structures are appropriate. Parking structures will be sited to promote a pedestrian-friendly, academic-oriented campus. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 5 of 29 | 2.0 GOP UCF will endorse development of an \"intercept garage\" concept in the future to relieve traffic congestion in the campus core. Adjacent land uses and projected needs will be considered when selecting appropriate sites for parking development. Structured parking facilities will be used to conserve available land. Roadways must have adequate capacity to effectively fill and empty garages and lots and minimize impact. Density: target 800 spaces per acre for structured parking Mixed Land Use The Mixed Land Use category allows for an assortment of facility types in a specific area. Land uses allowed under this designation include academic, research, support, residential, parking, recreation/open space, and utilities. The purpose of this category is to identify specific areas where it is advantageous to combine one or more uses during the planning and development process. Density/Intensity: target FAR 3.0 Recreation & Open Space Land Use The Recreation & Open Space Land Use category shall allow active and passive recreation uses, as well as general open space areas. Intensity shall be ...based on a target number of Recreation & Open Space acres per 1,000 FTE students on the Main Campus. Density/Intensity Target: 14.75 acres minimum per 1,000 FTE students Density/Intensity Actual: 14.73 acres per 1,000 FTE students3 Recreation Active Recreation or Activity-based Recreation includes: Intercollegiate Athletics: sporting event venues (football, soccer, softball, etc.) and training facilities for University teams, e.g., Wayne Densch Sports Center Intramural and Recreational sports: indoor and outdoor recreation facilities, e.g., intramural sports facilities and clubs (softball, soccer, tennis, etc.), gymnasia (including Recreation & Wellness Center), and the UCF Band Practice Facility Passive Recreation Passive Recreation or Resource-based Recreation includes recreation areas for the passive enjoyment of nature (picnic areas, hiking trails, lakes, etc.) Open Space Open Space includes man-made l andscapes (malls, courtyards, plazas, quadrangles, parks, etc.) and passive recreational facilities (nature trails, uplands, etc.) Conservation Land Use The Conservation land use category shall allow conservation uses in conformance with the Conservation Element of the Campus Master 545.81ac / 37.06 FTE (x1,000) Acreage Open Space, page 12 (545.81 Acres) Student Data: 1.0 Introduction, page 2 (37,057 FTE 2018-2019) 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 6 of 29 | 2.0 GOP Plan.

Figure 2.0-1 indicates how UCF's land is distributed between developed, developable, and undevelopable lands. Room to grow While developed areas have gr own to nearly 600 acres, an even larger area has been set aside as perpetual and long-term conservation land. Nearly 150 acres of the Main Campus is underdeveloped, vacant, or open land that UCF considers developable. This acreage will accommodate all projected growth within the planning timeframe and well into the future. Figure 2.0-1 Current Land Utilization Table DEVELOPED LAND 594.8 Acres Developed land with infill sites available 215.0 The Campus Core is that part of the campus inside of Gemini Boulevard. The area inside of the 1,200-foot radius sidewalk (Apollo Circle) is known as the Academic Core. Outside of Apollo Circle are student housing, parking garages and lots, student services, and the Arboretum (see undevelopable land ). 164.0 South Campus lies between Libra Drive and Central Florida Bvd and is home to Recreation and Wellness Center facilities and intramural fields, student housing, the UCF Band Facility, the Facilities and Safety Complex, and a few academic buildings. 68.9 The Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village in the northeast area of campus is home to UCF Athletics facilities on both sides of N. Orion Bvd. 24.9 Ara Drive is a research and campus support neighborhood on the southeast edge of campus. Fully developed land with no infill sites 25.0 The existing Greek Park is a neighborhood of fraternity and sorority houses. 5.9 Lake Claire Recreation Area is a park on Lake Claire at the north edge of campus. 26.0 The Knights Plaza area, once known as UpTown UCF has a mix of student housing, intercollegiate spor ts facilities, and retail venues. 65.1 Roads, etc. DEVELOPABLE LAND 147.8 Acres Large tracts of undeveloped or underdeveloped land 47.0 Parcel A - a parcel on the east side of campus, set aside for a future UCF president, also known as the Partnership Campus or the President's Reserve. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN DATA & ANALYSIS 16 of 29 | 2.0 D&A 57.9 Parcel B - a parcel on the southeast side of campus from Ara Drive to Percival Road, also known as the Eastern Parcel or 2912 Percival Rd. 28.8 Parcel C - the parcel bounded by University and Central Florida Boulevards, Alafaya Trail, and Gemini Boulevard. The only development in this parcel is Burnett House, the President's home. 6.8 Parcel D - a parcel of Alafaya Trail frontage north of Gemini Boulevard North at Alafaya, has been set aside for an extension to Greek Park. 7.3 Parcel E - two parcels of Alafaya Trail frontage, north and south of Centaurus Bvd.

Title interest for these parcels is held by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund (TIITF) . In addition to the parcels comprising the Main Campus, UCF controls the following TIITF parcel within the Context Area: McKay parcel: 11566 University Blvd (134.7 acres) This parcel is not considered part of the UCF Main Campus. Surplus Lands There are no surplus lands on campus. While conservation lands cannot be used for future development, they are not surplus. They serve as living laboratories for research and study by campus departments such as Biology, as well as for passive recreation spaces as defined in element 4.0 ATHLETICS, RECREATION & OPEN SPACE. Use of Underdeveloped Land University policy calls for the prudent use of underdeveloped land in the future, and the preservation of areas of environmental significance. In order to use the University's land resources efficiently and allow for the continuation of natural systems, future development will be relatively dense in character. Efforts will be made to minimize the impact of future development on the UCF Arboretum and other natural lands.

Businesses that desire a 'university relationship' can purchase land in the Research Park on which to cons truct a facility or can lease space for office, office/lab, or light manufacturing uses. Research Park tenants form relationshi ps with the University of Central Florida through technology transfer, research, faculty consultations, graduate and undergraduate internships and part-time employment programs. Research Park tenants can al so contract with the University for use of computer resource s and laboratory facilities. Employees in the Research Park can pay the appropriate fee and obtain UCF parking decals and UCF ID cards, which allow for the use of recreational facilitie s and the UCF library.\" The Research Park consists of 1,027 acres of land with 65 buildings, housing 145 companies with approximately 10,000 employees. The Research Park is designated for Industrial and Conservation land use by Orange County. UCF owns buildings in the Research Park, and also leases space from the UCF Foundation for a variety of activities, e.g., incubator space, research labs, the College of Nursing, the Nanoscience Technology Center, Human Resources and Purchasing offices, Regional Campus offices, and more.

EXISTING CONTEXT Narrative UCF's Main Campus is located in Orange County, 13 miles east of downtown Orlando; and just south of Seminole County and the City of Oviedo. The Academic Core of campus is located within Gemini Boulevard, centered around a cypress wetland in the heart of the campus adjacent to the Student Union. Pegasus Circle, the 400-foot radius path, surrounds the cypress wetland core and the Student Union Mercury Circle is an 800-foot radius path Apollo Circle is a 1,200-foot radius path Gemini Boulevard comprises the outermost border of the Academic Core The campus outside of Gemini Boulevard serves Residential, Recreational, Intercollegiate Athletic, and Support areas; as well as an extensive, forested wetland system in the southeastern portion of the campus that eventually drains into the Econlockhatchee River. The Central Florida Research Park borders the southern edge of campus. A wide, natural buffer borders much of the nearly 8-mile campus perimeter boundary, including: Nearly a mile and a quarter of conservation and wetland along McCulloch Road; Nearly two miles of natural land along the eastern boundary of campus, adjacent to residential areas and Percival Road; and Much of the western border of campus along Alafaya Boulevard; however, this area is likely to succumb to development within the next ten to twenty years. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN DATA & ANALYSIS 22 of 29 | 2.0 D&A Character of Existing Context Area Orange County designates the University as Institutional Future Land Use. The area, in which the University is situated, comprises a mix of housing, industrial, planned development, and commercial uses. UCF is bordered by areas classified for diverse uses. On its southern border lies the Central Florida Research Park, whose designation is predominately for high-tech industrial use. Small commercial areas, multi-family housing, and vacant land are found to the west of Alafaya Trail, and south of University Boulevard. A planned development called the Quadrangle exists to the north of University Boulevard. This complex comprises a mix of offices, commercial areas, and hotel facilities. The demand for space will undoubtedly grow as more corporations relocate to the UCF area. 2. BUILDING PLACEMENT The UCF Landscape Master Plan and Design Guidelines includes a map explaining the organization of the campus (see Figure 2.0-2 Urban Design Map). The Student Union is at the heart of the Academic Core of campus, encircled by concentric circle sidewalks at radii of 400, 800, and 1,200 feet, and then by Gemini Boulevard. The campus is bisected from southwest to northeast by a dominant linear axis that links some of the most prominent campus landmarks. The axis starts at the head of Central Florida Boulevard and extends northeast, connecting the Duke Energy University Welcome Center, Millican Hall, the Reflecting Pond, John C. Hitt Library, the Student Union, Memory Mall, Knights Plaza and the Additions Arena. Academic functions are located primarily between the 400-foot and 1,200-foot radius circles, an area known as the Academic Core. Certain identifiable districts have developed within the Academic Core. For example, Engineering, Mathematics, Sciences, CREOL, Technology, Chemistry, and Research I are concentrated in the southeastern quadrant. Grouping similar functions and areas of study into districts is encouraged, since it places similar resources in close proximity to one another. This leads to greater efficiency and accessibility and a reduction of vehicular trips. Outside the 1,200-foot radius circle but within Gemini Boulevard, there are a few academic buildings; but mostly student housing, parking garages and lots, and support facilities. Intramural Fields and Student Recreation are concentrated in the south of campus and north of the Research Park, along with some Support facilities and Housing. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN DATA & ANALYSIS 23 of 29 | 2.0 D&A Student housing in the northwest area of campus includes the Lake Claire Community Apartments, and Greek Park, a neighborhood for sorority and fraternity housing. Intercollegiate fields and facilities are outside of Gemini Boulevard to the northeast of campus in the area recently named the Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village. 3. ORGANIZATION OF OPEN SPACES Significant, high-activity buildings and open spaces: Open spaces on campus are shaped by the buildings and landscapes that surround them. Open spaces range from the formal to the natural, from the public to the intimate. They serve a variety of functions, such as places for gathering, recreation, reflection, and study; and they provide visual and sound buffers. Open spaces can serve as nodes of diverse activities and functions, and they should be linked in a logical and sequential way. These linkages can be the glue that binds together corresponding districts, as well as the cohesive force connecting the various areas of the campus. Open space can also be characterized as a setting which features soft, suburban, curvilinear, green, and passive components. Reflecting Pond and Surrounding Lawn The open space between Millican Hall and the John C. Hitt Library is part of the University's Central Axis (see Figure 2.0-2 Urban Design Map). The focal point of this greenspace is the Reflecting Pond, a campus landmark that plays host to a UCF Homecoming tradition, \"Spirit Splash\", and other memorable events. Memory Mall This Mall is a formal, linear open space flanked by academic buildings. It functions as a stage for campus activities, such as tailgating during football games and ROTC formations, as well as casual and spontaneous activities. Arboretum The UCF Arboretum provides opportunities for students, faculty, staff, and visitors to explore and learn about the plant life and other natural wonders of our beautiful campus. It serves as an outdoor living laboratory that enables students to engage in relevant, experience-based learning. Recreation and Wellness Center Located near a large portion of UCF housing, this facility is a hub for health and wellness, and a vibrant node of student activity. Student Union Located at the center of the campus, natural boardwalks hover over the wetlands and meander between the bearded cypress trees, leading to the Student Union. John C. Hitt Library The Library serves as an active space for study, socializing, and meetings. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN DATA & ANALYSIS 24 of 29 | 2.0 D&A John T. Washington Student Center Walkway The signature sky-lit, covered breezeway is an outdoor gathering place flanked by the UCF Barnes & Noble Bookstore, credit union, restaurants, and student services. Greenspace at South Memory Mall Raised planters with grassy berms and arching palms, provide an oasis where students relax in hammocks, sit and talk, and walk along the adjacent, brick-paved Pegasus circle. Lake Claire Recreation Area This beautiful recreation facility offers activities such as kayaking, canoeing, and picnicking; as well as hiking or strolling in the adjacent natural areas. Addition Arena and Knights Plaza This lively civic hub hosts large, public activities both in the Addition Financial Arena and on the beautiful Knight's Plaza. East and West Plaza Drive Shopping, dining, and housing activities make these corridors into energetic urban ways. West Plaza Drive winds around the north edge of Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village and connects Gemini Boulevard to North Orion Boulevard. 4. CAMPUS VISUAL STRUCTURE Permanent buildings on campus range in height from one to seven stories. The exteriors of these buildings are predominantly brick. Additional exterior materials include concrete, metal panels, and glazing. The predominance of brick, accompanied by the relative scale of the buildings on campus, helps create a significant level of visual continuity. The campus is shaped by the natural landscape from which it has been carved. The concentric organization gives further structure to the visual environment. Pegasus Circle (400-foot radius), Mercury Circle (800- foot radius), Apollo Circle (1,200-foot radius), and Gemini Boulevard help students with visual wayfinding. 5. EXISTING FUNCTIONAL LINKAGES Automobile Primary vehicular access to the campus is through University Boulevard, Alafaya Trail, Research Park, and McCulloch Road. Vehicular access to the Main Campus from the eleven-county Service Area and other UCF campuses uses various major roadways, including I-4, the Beachline Expressway (SR 528), the East-West Expressway (SR 408), and Colonial Drive (SR 50). Campus Entrances Of UCF's six (6) entrance roads, four (4) enter from Alafaya Trail (SR 434): University Boulevard is the main vehicular entrance into campus, serving more than 21,000 vehicles pe r day. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN DATA & ANALYSIS 25 of 29 | 2.0 D&A Central Florida Boulevard displays the most formalized type of entry into the campus, because of its axial relationship to campus landmarks. However, it is the least used entrance. Gemini Boulevard North is heavily used by more than 16,000 vehicles per day. It is bordered on the north by Conservation Land and the Lake Claire Recreation Area. Centaurus Boulevard will eventually be the cultural entrance to campus, as it will align with a future Performing Arts Center. The remaining two entrances are from the north and south: North Orion Boulevard enters from Seminole County to the north, and wraps around the entire east border of the Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village. Libra Drive is the only southern entrance, entering from the Central Florida Research Park. It is the most convenient means to travel to UCF after exiting SR 408. Pedestrian The UCF campus was planned and developed with pedestrians in mind, based on a maximum walking time of eight minutes to the center of campus from the 1,200-foot outer radius (Apollo Circle). The 800-foot radius (Mercury Circle) provides a five-minute walking trip to the campus center, and the 400-foot radius Pegasus Circle frames the center of campus. A network of secondary pedestrian paths with corresponding offshoots provides access between buildings throughout campus. Pedestrian Safety Pedestrian hazards are created whenever vehicular circulation and pedestrian ways cross, or when vehicular circulation crosses parking lots, as it does in many instances throughout campus. UCF has been working to identify and mitigate existing hazards, and to limit future hazards through effective planning and design. UCF is also working on various projects with Orange County to improve pedestrian safety along Alafaya Trail (SR 434). Bicycle Bicycles provide many students with an economical and efficient source of transportation, due to the proximity of off-campus housing. There are bicycle paths found throughout campus, including those on Libra Drive and Gemini Boulevard North, and along Central Florida Boulevard. Bicycle racks are currently provi ded for approximately 6,500 bicycles on campus. Bicycling is a healthy and environmentally-supportive alternative and should be encouraged as a means of reducing vehicular traffic on campus. Transit UCF is meeting the demand for student transportation by offering both on-campus and off-campus shuttle service (see 6.0 TRANSPORTATION). Shuttles pr ovide free, safe and convenient transportation services to and from the main campus, including to nearby housing communities, and satellite campuses (Rosen College, Health Sciences, and Downtown Campus. Strategically located 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN DATA & ANALYSIS 26 of 29 | 2.0 D&A shuttle stops minimize the walking distance to classrooms or campus activities. ANALYSES The evolution of the development pattern of University buildings and open spaces There has been significant development on campus since the first Campus Master Plan in 1995. Much of the original campus development spread concentrically from the heart of campus. As program needs continue to demand more academic and support space, development should respect our historic evolution around the circular pattern of the campus, while maintaining a relatively dense pattern. Particular attention should be paid to the creation of attractive open spaces, reinforced by careful site-planning. Of important concern is the preservation and enhancement of axial pedestrian links to and from the center of campus, which work to create long views and facilitate wayfinding. Facilities Not all facilities are named here. See 3.0 HOUSING for more on the dates and development of housing communities. Support facilities were also provided, but most are not listed. Pre-1995 Millican Hall, John C. Hitt Library, Chemistry, Theatre, Ferrell Commons, Mathematical Sciences, Technology Commons, Howard Phillips Hall, Colbourn Hall (demolished), Biological Sciences, Education, John T. Washington Center, Wayne Densch 1 and 2 (demolished), Engineering I, Business Administration I, UCF Arena (now Addition Arena), Visual Arts, and housing. 1995-2000 The Student Union, CREOL Building, College of Sciences, Barbara Ying Center, College of Arts & Humanities, Health & Public Affairs I, the Nicholson School. 2000-2005 Classroom Building, I, Recreation and Wellness Center, Health & Public Affairs II, Engineering II, Burnett Honors College, Teaching Academy, Business Administration II, and housing. 2005-2010 Fairwinds Alumni Center, Health Center, Nicholson Field House, Harris Engineering Center, the Towers, Psychology Building, UCF Stadium (Now Spectrum Stadium), Knights Plaza. 2010-2015 Performing Arts Center, Physical Sciences Building, Classroom Building II, Public Safety Building, Visitor and Parking Information, and housing. 2015-2020 Wayne Densch Center for Student-Athlete Leadership, Student Health Center Expansion, UCF Global, Research I, Trevor Colbourn Hall, CREOL expansion. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN DATA & ANALYSIS 27 of 29 | 2.0 D&A Advantages and Disadvantages of Alternative Spatial Configurations UCF will continue to coordinate the pattern of buildings and spaces leading to the center of campus and those along the university/community boundaries. Buildings should be organized in a way that complements and frames the open spaces around them. The deliberate planning and preservation of open spaces creates memorable landmarks and improves the pedestrian experience, and the importance of these spaces cannot be overstated. Axial relationships to the center of campus should be enforced and programmed in the future growth framework, while maintaining the circular paths and roadways important to the history of the University. The Central Axis Memory Mall is an example of central axis development, as buildings along its edge reinforce the connection between the Student Union and Knights Plaza. This axis continues across the Student Union and is mirrored at the front door to the campus, where the Duke Energy University Welcome Center is located at the head of Central Florida Boulevard. See Figure 2.0-2 Urban Design Map for a diagram of the Central Axis. South of the Campus Core A new activity hub was formed, south of Gemini Boulevard, when the Academic Villages housing complex, the Recreation and Wellness Center (RWC), and the RWC Intramural fields were created. Links to the campus core from this area should continue to be reinforced. Alternative location and linkage concepts for the campus and the context area Gateway configurations tie the campus to its neighboring communities, define the perimeter access to campus, and create a lasting first impression for visitors. UCF Entrances UCF has six entrances, each of which represents an opportunity to tie UCF to its host and affected communities. Main Campus Entrance The main entrance to UCF is University Boulevard, entering off of Alafaya Trail. This entrance does not make a strong entrance statement despite being 4 lanes wide with a narrow median. UCF intends to improve this entrance, concurrent with an upcoming partnership project with Orange County to improve pedestrian safety along Alafaya Trail. Secondary Campus Entrances Other entrances to campus are understated, but at this time, there are no plans to improve them. They include: North Orion Boulevard (north entrance) Gemini Boulevard North (west entrance) Centaurus Boulevard (west entrance) Central Florida Boulevard (west entrance) Libra Drive (south entrance) West University/Community Boundary The campus frontage along Alafaya Trail has long remained an undeveloped buffer between UCF and the burgeoning urban retail and residential areas west of Alafaya Trail. 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN DATA & ANALYSIS 28 of 29 | 2.0 D&A The construction of the Celeste Hotel,9 on the UCF frontage north of University Boulevard, crosses the buffer and links UCF to the Plaza on University, a popular urban retail and residential development at the northwest corner of Alafaya Trail and University Boulevard. North University/Community Boundary The campus frontage along McCulloch Road will remain an undeveloped buffer between UCF and Seminole County, because it predominately comprises Conservation land. Further, McCulloch Road is not user-friendly or safe for pedestrians: Both sides of the road lack continuous sidewalks. There is a sidewalk on the north side of the road from Alafaya to Lockwood, and on the south side from North Orion to Tanner Road. There are no street lights, except for a few decorative ones near the entrance to Carillon. No midblock crossing is available between Alafaya and Lockwood, a distance of nearly a mile. \"Beaten paths\" through the natural areas just south of McCulloch Road invite students to cross the street and enter campus at random locations. The natural areas on the north border of campus must be improved for the safety and welfare of students coming from the apartment complexes north of campus. UCF will work with Seminole County to improve the safety of this campus border road. 9 The Celeste Hotel was originally known as the Pegasus Hotel. 29 of 29 | 2.0 MAPS 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN MAPS 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN Figure 2.0-1 Figure 2.0-1 Future Land Use Map N 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN Figure 2.0-2 Figure 2.0-2 Urban Design Map 5 1.

The bed counts for the housing described below are listed in Figure 3.0 -1 Inventory of beds on the Main Campus. ADA Compliance UCF Housing complies with ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) throughout the building inventory. Apollo Community The University's first housing project , the Apollo Community, opened in the fall of 1968 .

Potential On -Campus Housing Sites In order to address the on -campus housing deficit reported in Figure 3.0-2, UCF has identified potential sites for future housing: The former site of Wayne Densch Buildings 38 and 39, on Gemini Boulevard, has been set aside by the BOT for the future \"Dining, Housing, and Residential Life Facility.\" A Specialty Housin g area, at the northwest corner of Alafaya Trail and Gemini Boulevard North, has been set aside by the BOT as the future \"Greek Park Extension.\" East and west of the existing Academic Village, there are two infill sites that could support more housing. Based on the results of a future Housing Master Plan , projected housing projects and sites may be revised from those shown in 10.0 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS & IMPLEMENTATION. Any revisions will require a Minor Amendment to the 2020 -30 Campus Master Plan Update. 11 of 11 | 3.0 Maps 3.0 HOUSING MAPS 3.0 HOUSING Figure 3.0 -7 Figure 3.0-7 Exiting On -Campus Housing Map EXISTING ON-CAMPUS HOUSING A.

Intercollegiate athletics facilities (courts, fields, specialty facilities) have always been part of the Recreation & Open Space Element. For the 2020-30 CMP, UCF has changed the name of the element to clearly include Athletics. In order to provide a comprehensive inventory of all existing recreation and open space facilities, such facilities will be organized based on the following chart. Activity-based Facilities Activity-based facilities are defined as those facilities designed, constructed, and designated for specific sports or recreation activities, including intercollegiate, intramural, and recreational tracks and sports fields, multipurpose courts, and special facilities (fitness centers, ropes courses, pools). Resource-based Facilities Resource-Based refers to those facilities that are primarily used for general recreation or organized social functions. Resource- Based facilities are open to all and not designated for specific recreational activities or sports. Resource-Based facilities may include open green space, public parks, nature trails, conservation areas. Resource-Based facilities are further defined and categorized as active and passive resources. Active Resource-Based Facilities are generally accessible open spaces or parks where recreation activities are not specific, such as open fields, picnic areas, nature trails, public parks Passive Resource-Based Facilities refer to those areas that are relatively inaccessible to any types of recreation activities; and although not publicly accessible, they provide visual and climatic enhancements to the campus. They include conservation and environmental mitigation lands. 4.0 ATHLETICS, RECREATION & OPEN SPACE INTRODUCTION 2 of 20 | 4.0 INTRO RELATED ELEMENTS See 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE for additional information on conservation, wetlands and open space.

A review of Activity-Based recreation space illustrates a deficit of space to serve the campus community's needs (see Figure 4.0-6 for the total Activity-Based based Recreation & Open Space acreage). The following comparisons to other institutions and to recognized space-planning guidelines further illuminate the need for additional Activity-Based recreation space. Several projects specific to the UCF Recreation and Wellness Center have been undertaken to address this deficit; but more indoor, outdoor, and fitness recreation spaces are needed.

For locations of Recreation facilities on-campus facilities, see Figure 4.0-14 Current Recreation Facilities Inventory Map. As indicated by the Level of Service (LOS) standards, UCF currently has a lower existing level of service for recreation space than the NIRSA standards or other universities with similar enrollment. In addition to the LOS standard from NIRSA, it is important to consider current NIRSA Facilities and Construction Reports such as \"Facility Construction & Renovation at NIRSA Member 4 Source: UCF IKM Enrollment 4.0 ATHLETICS, RECREATION & OPEN SPACE DATA & ANALYSIS 14 of 20 | 4.0 D&A Institutions, 2016-2020, \" and other publications such as \" Physical Space on Campus\" from the ACUI 2012 Summit on Building Community, and Recreation Planning Principles , outlined by the NIRSA and Society for College and University Planning (SCUP) through a joint effort, that include: Establish recreation as a pillar of the University's comprehensive plan Create and maintain a vision of physical development of recreational facilities, a vision which supports the mission and master plan Instill a real sense of community and enrich the experience of all who come to campus; and Foster a safe, secure, and accessible environment SUMMARY The UCF Recreation and Wellness Center (RWC) comprises many programs, such as Intramural Sports, Sport Clubs, Outdoor Adventure, Fitness, and Aquatics. The RWC is open to all students; paid memberships are available for non-students. The RWC offers a vast array of state-of-the-art facilities, including: Recreation and Wellness Center - the main facility (156,111 gross square feet), includes: o Track (1/8 mile) o Multipurpose Courts (6) o Racquetball Courts (4) o Fitness Space o Custom Climbing Wall Outdoor Adventure Center, includes: o Challenge Course o Equipment Rentals o Climbing Tower o Lake Claire Recreation Area o Adventure Trips Leisure Pool (186,000 gallon) Lap Pool (9-lane regulation) Tennis Courts (9) Disc Golf Course (nine-hole) Sand Volleyball Courts (4) 5 Outdoor basketball courts (3) Knights Plaza satellite fitness facility (8,700 square feet) RWC Park (Sport fields complex that includes multipurpose sport fields, softball fields, and the Challenge Course) These facilities support the recreational needs of the UCF community. Additional enhancements and expansion at the Recreation and Wellness Center, RWC Park, and Lake Claire would help to offset the space deficit and bring recreation space 5 The sand volleyball courts (4) will eventually be moved to RWC Park, to provide space for one more tennis court, and because the sand is a maintenance and safety issue for the Leisure Pool and tennis courts. 4.0 ATHLETICS, RECREATION & OPEN SPACE DATA & ANALYSIS 15 of 20 | 4.0 D&A closer to the level that is desirable based on national standards, usage demands, and comparisons to other universities. Past expansion of the RWC and the addition of the Knights Plaza facility in 2013 have greatly improved the indoor facility inventory. Existing recreation facilities still remain insufficient to support the current and future needs of UCF and its student enrollment. Overall, UCF is currently below the national guidelines and standards for Activity-Based recreation facilities. The vision of the UCF Recreation and Wellness center strives to both set and stay ahead of national standards for university recreation programs and facilities. As the campus continues to grow, more land will be needed for buildings, parking and Activity-Based recreation facilities. Future Resource-Based recreation and open space must be carefully developed, utilizing spaces formed between buildings and the protection and expansion of natural areas. Improvements to Recreation Facilities Based on observation, student satisfaction surveys, and data published by NIRSA, the following specific list of problems, constraints, and opportunities were identified. They are not in priority order. Lake Claire Recreation Area The Mary Jo and William E. Davis Recreation Area at Lake Claire has become a thriving natural recreation facility on campus, with a highly visible location on the northwest corner of campus near Greek Park. The facility was redeveloped in 2012 to include new picnic pavilions (3), new sand volleyball courts (2), and a lighted playing field. Exercise stations and an ADA accessible dock and restroom have also been added to enhance the facility. Boathouse storage space at the Lake Claire Recreation Area is currently not adequate to store the necessary equipment. A total renovation of the boathouse is needed to create a boathouse that is both fitting to the area's aesthetics and allows its staff to serve students more efficiently as well as to assure proper gear and boat storage techniques; and create more secure storage space. A master plan for the facility was created in 2010. Currently, the parking lot at the Lake Claire Recreation Area is composed of dirt and gravel, bordered by movable blocks of wood. There is a need to renovate this lot to create an efficient and defined parking system. UCF will consider porous paving options, to offset an increase to impervious surfaces. There are a few under-maintained trails through the woods behind Lake Claire. To keep up with the progress and aesthetics of the trails created by the Arboretum, these trails 4.0 ATHLETICS, RECREATION & OPEN SPACE DATA & ANALYSIS 16 of 20 | 4.0 D&A should be extended, maintained, and connected with current on-campus trails. The Recreation and Wellness Center (RWC) The Recreation and Wellness Center helps to serve the recreation needs of the UCF community. The 85,000 square foot facility was opened in 2002 and expanded in 2010 to add 65,000 square feet, including more fitness area, multipurpose courts, racquetball courts, a new lap pool, and an outdoor adventure center. These additions have been successful, but still leave UCF with inadequate square footage compared to peer institutions and national standards. The intent is for the current site, south and west of the existing facility, to be built out to serve the needs of the UCF community. A master plan exercise in 2007 indicates that the site could be expanded to over 200,000 square feet and include additional court space, multipurpose rooms, functional fitness space, and an expansion to the outdoor adventure center. The RWC @ Ferrell Commons facility was renovated in 2015 to provide a dedicated space for Sport Club martial arts clubs to practice, however it decreased the overall space available for Sport Clubs, as the facility was divided to accommodate the Lead Scholars Academy. For operational purposes, dedicated indoor Sport Club space should be included in the expansion of the Recreation and Wellness Center. RWC Outdoor Facilities RWC Park The RWC Park encompasses all of the outdoor playing field facilities in a park-like environment on the south side of campus. The Park was master planned to include state-of-the-art artificial turf fields and support facilities. The first phase of the redevelopment of the park was completed in 2006, and added three (3) lighted artificial turf fields to the existing softball fields, sport club fields, and multipurpose fields. Phase II construction was completed in 2009, and added three (3) additional lighted turf fields, a support and restroom facility (building 320), and a maintenance facility (building 321). Other RWC Outdoor Facilities Additional outdoor facilities include a 9-court tennis complex, 3 outdoor basketball courts, and a 9-hole disc golf course. 4.0 ATHLETICS, RECREATION & OPEN SPACE DATA & ANALYSIS 17 of 20 | 4.0 D&A Softball Fields Future phases of RWC Park must address the shortfall of softball fields, the addition of lighted fields dedicated to Sport Clubs, and a support facility for safety, security, and access. UCF currently has a critical shortage of softball fields. UCF currently has one (1) softball field, and NIRSA standards call for 9.9 (0.15 fields per 1000 students). As recently as 2000, UCF had three (3) softball fields, but expansion of University Housing decreased the quantity. There is only enough space to add one (1) softball field within the current RWC park footprint, due to the size parcel required. Additional space for softball fields should be identified elsewhere on campus or adjacent to campus. Recreational fields in the south area of campus need to be expanded to increase student capacity and provide opportunities for field rotation to avoid compaction and abuse. During expansion, a resulting temporary reduction in service is a concern, because of the critical need for recreational space on a residential campus. Calculations used to assess facility sufficiency take into consideration a number of factors, including variety of fields (sport clubs, intramural sports, or open recreation), frequency of use, student enrollment, and unique layout that diminishes the flexibility for use (i.e. softball field). RWC Park needs a Support Facility to provide additional security and a severe weather shelter, along with restrooms and indoor programming space. The RWC Park area needs additional parking. This can be accommodated by expanding the current parking lot. It is recommended that UCF assess the access roads and parking near the RWC Park, as these are currently ineffective. Challenge Course The RWC Park also includes the Challenge Course. The Challenge Course contains high and low ropes course elements for team development and leadership training. Future phases of the Challenge Course should include additional high and low elements to provide new program resources and accommodate larger groups. The open space around the Challenge Course must also be preserved, as the facility is intended to be secluded within a natural area and any encroachment on its buffer would lessen its effectiveness. 4.0 ATHLETICS, RECREATION & OPEN SPACE DATA & ANALYSIS 18 of 20 | 4.0 D&A Tennis Courts UCF has an inadequate quantity of tennis courts. The current tennis complex, west of Libra Garage, has nine (9) courts that are shared by the entire campus, including UCF Athletics. Additional courts should be provided to serve the UCF student body. o NIRSA standards indicate 0.41 Tennis Courts per 1,000 students, which would indicate that UCF needs 27 courts (deficit of 18 courts). o The current tennis complex can accommodate one additional court, for a total of ten (10), after the relocation of the four sand volleyball courts to RWC Park. o UCF Athletics is considering adding intercollegiate tennis courts near the Softball Complex. This will relieve a great deal of strain on the existing tennis complex. 4.2 Intercollegiate Athletics - Current & Future Facilities NARRATIVE UCF Athletics is committed to making the Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village the best of its kind in collegiate athletics.

These plans are also intended to ensure that growth does not negatively impact the environment, and that infrastructure and University-provided utility services are not overwhelmed by unplanned development. As such, future development at UCF shall be based on the provisions that optimizes the use of UCF's existing utility infrastructure and utility generation assets. Furthermore, conserving UCF's precious water resources through on-going collaborative and integrated planning will avoid technical and financial risks, and capacity constraints associated with overburdening the University's generation, distribution, and transmission systems. Campus development shall adhere to higher-density development best practices, while meeting, or exceeding the University's prescriptive green-building requirements to effectively minimize heat gain and energy consumption, and reduce dependence on the region's potable water. These practices will inevitably reduce utility demands and the need for additional infrastructure and capacity. UCF shall continue to follow ASHRAE high-performance building standards and apply engineering rigor to all design considerations for energy and water efficiency initiatives implemented in UCF's campus facilities. Therefore, all building systems shall be treated as \"utility system assets\" in all new expansion and renovation projects. This will result in more effective and efficient use of the University resources to reduce regional resource impacts, campus operational expenses, and UCF's overall environmental impact. RELATED ELEMENTS See 9.0 CONSERVATION for utility use reduction strategies (such as energy and water) and for information on the advanced microgrid technology.

Optional elements are permitted under BOG 21.212, but are not subject to review under Chapter 21. CONCURRENCY Concurrency Management Systems, as defined in Florida Statute 163.3180, require systems for monitoring and ensuring adherence to the adopted level-of-service standards, including the schedule of capital improvements and the availability of public facility capacity. For the purpose of concurrency under F.S. 163.3180, public facilities (utilities) and services include sanitary sewer and potable water. UCF has elected to make additional public facilities and services subject to the concurrency management system under Florida Statue that include chilled water, primary electric power, natural gas, and stormwater. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 3 of 33 | 5.0 GOP GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE Go als, Objectives, & Policies 5.0 Utility Infrastructure Overview NARRATIVE The cost of utilities, and associated infrastructure to provide utility services, is significant and may even exceed the cost of the buildings themselves over their useful life. 1 The objective of utility system and infrastructure master planning is to guide decision-making to ensure that utility cost savings are realized over the life of buildings and systems. According to the UCF Collective Impact Five-Year Institutionalization Plan 2, UCF must align its facilities planning, infrastructure development, and project prioritizati on to advance Collective Impact, per the UCF Collective Impact Strategic Plan3. This Plan launched a process to set UCF's trajectory for the next 20 years to make a greater impact on lives and livelihoods at UCF, throughout the region, and beyond. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES GOAL 1: Develop and manage UCF's utility production, distribution infrastructure, and associated capital assets to support campus needs.

POLICY 1.2.2: The University will implement and maintain smart infrastructure technologies to monitor reliability and efficiency of infrastructure distribution and production systems. 5.1 Stormwater Management Sub-Element NARRATIVE The University's stormwater system is located in the St. Johns River basin and is regulated by the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD). As defined by SJRWMD, stormwater is rainwater that runs off of hard surfaces into the nearest body of water, both natural lakes and/or man-made retention ponds. A stormwater system is a tool for managing that runoff. As UCF continues to grow, stormwater management becomes exponentially crucial as new development increases the risk of disruption to natural hydrological systems and watersheds. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 5 of 33 | 5.0 GOP GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES GOAL 1: Manage stormwater by replicating natural site hydrology to protect campus populations and facilities, and remain sensitive to the environment. OBJECTIVE 1.1: Pursue low-impact development practices to prevent increases to stormwater runoff. POLICY 1.1.1: Stormwater management retention and detention features shall be incorporated into the design of parks, trails, commons and open spaces, and building roof tops where such features do not detract from the recreational or aesthetic value of a site. POLICY 1.1.2: Native vegetation and/or xeriscaping shall be employed, where feasible, to reduce peak runoff downstream through infiltration and storage. POLICY 1.1.3: Techniques such as infiltration, storage and reuse, bio retention, open-grid pavement, and the reduction of impervious areas shall be used in attempt to reduce runoff. POLICY 1.1.4: Any future development which increases the amount of impervious surface shall report the change in total volume of runoff (in cubic feet) relative to the existing site performance of stormwater runoff, assuming the 95 th percentile of rainfall events.

OBJECTIVE 1.2: Use Green Industry Best Management Practices (BMPs) to minimize University-generated stormwater pollutants. POLICY 1.2.1: The University shall use slow release fertilizers and/or carefully-managed and timed fertilizer applications to ensure maximum root uptake and minimal surface water runoff or leaching into groundwater. POLICY 1.2.2: The University shall perform routine maintenance on its motor vehicle fleet to prevent oil, grease, and other fluids from leaking onto impervious surfaces, where they might be conveyed to surface and ground waters by runoff. The University shall regularly collect and properly dispose of yard debris. POLICY 1.2.3: The University s hall avoid the use of broad-spectrum pesticides, using the least-toxic and minimal applications, aimed at targeted species, when possible. POLICY 1.2.4: The University shall coordinate pesticide application with irrigation schedules to reduce runoff and leaching into groundwater. POLICY 1.2.5: The University shall incorporate features into the design of fertilizer and pesticide storage, mixing, and loading areas that are designed to prevent/minimize spillage. OBJECTIVE 1.3: Oversee UCF's stormwater management. POLICY 1.3.1: LNR shall maintain all rainwater management facilities, perform monthly inspections, and resolve any issues within three months of identification. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 6 of 33 | 5.0 GOP POLICY 1.3.2: UES shall perform all subsurface maintenance pertaining to stormwater management including, but not limited to, inlets, manholes, and pipes connecting stormwater movement and drainage. POLICY 1.3.3: Landscape and Natural Resources (LNR) shall perform all above-ground maintenance pertaining to stormwater, including but not limited to areas of erosion, retention and detention ponds, storm inlets, and environmental permitting. 5.2 Sanitary Sewer Sub-Element NARRATIVE The University operates and maintains its own sanitary sewer collection facilities6 and transportation network comprising basins, lift stations, force mains, gravity lines, pump stations, and appurtenant equipment to collect and transport effluent to the Iron Bridge Water Pollution Control Facility (Iron Bridge), a regional wastewater treatment plant in Seminole County. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES GOAL 1: Ensure that the sanitary sewer system adequately serves current and future campus needs. OBJECTIVE 1.1: Maintain the sanitary sewer system and upgrade its mechanical and electrical components. POLICY 1.1.1. The University shall design and construct sanitary sewer system improvements to e liminate system deficiencies, maintain and improve system characteristics, and expand the system to accommodate demand from proposed growth. POLICY 1.1.2. The wastewater pumping stations shall employ backup systems in case of power or pump failures. POLICY 1.1.3. Analyze future development to determine if current wastewater capacity is available. If capacity is not available, funding will be provided so that additional capacity can be purchased from Seminole County in advance of need. 5.3 Potable Water Sub-Element NARRATIVE When UCF was first constructed in the 1960s, no municipal water services or infrastructure were available in the area. Consequently, the University had to construct its own water treatment facilities, distribution infrastructure, and ground wells to meet its potable water needs. While significant renovations have occurred as a result of more stringent drinking water standards mandated by Florida's Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), UCF's elevated 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 7 of 33 | 5.0 GOP and ground water storage tanks are original, including much of the buried ductile iron distribution pipe on campus. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES GOAL 1: Provide quality potable water to the campus with reliable backup sources.

Chilled water produced in the district cooling system is distributed through over 15-miles of underground pipes to cool student residence halls, academic, research, administrative, and athletic facilities. UCF's district plants are strategically placed to efficiently service the needs of core campus buildings and reduce building energy consumption. The remaining campus buildings are currently supported by less-efficient, stand-alone chilled water systems, direct expansion HVAC units, and ground source heat pumps. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES GOAL 1: Promote district cooling with energy and economic efficiency where appropriate within the district energy loop. OBJECTIVE 1.1. Invest in energy technologies that facilitate economies of scale, otherwise infeasible on a single-building basis. POLICY 1.1.1: All new construction and renovation projects shall connect to UCF's thermal district energy systems based on the results of a life cycle cost analysis and where geographically feasible. 5.6 Electrical Power and Other Fuel Sub-Element NARRATIVE Primary power to the University is provided by Duke Energy Florida.

The University owns and maintains the natural gas infrastructure, and purchases wholesale natural gas on the open market. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES GOAL 1: Provide the campus with an eco-fri endly fuel to reduce utility expenditure and achieve greater h eating efficiencies. OBJECTIVE 1.1. Provide a natural gas system to reliably serve the University. POLICY 1.1.1: Continue to reduce purchased natural gas costs by leveraging competition among natural gas marketers and suppliers through contract negotiations on the open market. POLICY 1.1.2: The University shall use existing and developing technologies to provide additional safety and reliability for the campus systems. 5.8 Telecommunications Systems Sub-Element NARRATIVE UCF IT is an operating unit within the Information Technologies and Resources (IT&R) Division at UCF. The mission of UCF IT is to support our students, faculty, and staff in achieving their teaching, learning, research and service objectives by: Providing innovative technology solutions and services. Providing responsive and reliable IT infrastructure and support.

POLICY 1.2.1: UCF IT shall be responsible for the continued coordination of telecommunications infrastructure and services with off-site vendors and user groups. To the extent feasible, it shall be the responsibility of UCF IT and the Facilities Planning and Construction (FPC) department to determine jointly that service capacity is available to serve expanded needs in order to inform the University of any need for 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 12 of 33 | 5.0 GOP UCF funding for maintenance, expansion, or replacement of such systems. POLICY 1.2.2: The University shall establish the following overall implementation priorities: (1) continued servicing of the ex isting built areas of campus, (2) maintenance of the UCF-owned Maintenance Holes and duct bank system, (3) expansion of the existing telecommunications distribution system capacity in order to more efficiently serve existing demand, and (4) expansion of the telecommunications distribution system capacity, including the designation of future demarcation sites to link new development areas/buildings with on and off -campus systems. POLICY 1.2.3: The University shall rely upon the land uses identified in the 2020-30 CMP, and Capital Project projections identified in the SCP and the Capital Improvements Plan (CIP), to coordinate a staged expansion of telecommunications systems to ensure that an adequate system is on-line at the time of projected increased demand. This process shall be the shared responsibility of UCF IT, FPC, and the Office of the Vice President for Administration & Finance. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 13 of 33 | 5.0 D&A GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE Data & Analysis 5.0 Utility Infrastructure Overview NARRATIVE To reduce utility distribution infrastructure re-work on existing buildings, the University shall limit energy-i ntensive mixed-use space, thus focusing on a transformation that delivers financial gains through aggregating energy and water efficiency beyond the sum of the project's space. This may require re-evaluating existing space, performing energy and water audits, investing in technology that maximizes space utilization, taking full advantage of distance learning initiatives to reduce on-campus headcounts, and amending infrastructure capital improvement beyond the minimum statutory requirements, to achieve economies of scale. UES is the single point of contact and liaison for all campus utility distribution design, interconnection, disconnection, expansion, and construction of utility facilities. The University has the authority to prohibit or restrict external users from providing utility services within the campus based on regulations, adequate and reserve, flow, isolation, pressure, means, methods, size, make, materials, and available capacity. Utilities and interconnection to campus distribution or collection streams related to new building construction, renovations, remodels, additions, and alternations, whether performed by internal or external entities, must be reviewed and approved by the UES in writing prior to new construction, or r enovation project charter approval. In 2015, UES launched a 2D-mapping effort to better manage its assets and gain additional intelligence regarding the utility systems, and adopted pipe inventory and replacement planning and programming. Portions of UCF's central core infrastructure and facilities are nearing 50 years old. 11 Conditional needs warrant for dedicated cost centers phased in over time to prevent a continuing increase in backlog of infrastructure deferred maintenance. 12 Funding for plant renewal (excluding considerations for non-building infrastructure needs) should be earmarked at 1.5% to 2.0% of the total plant replacement costs.13 Capital Renewal Funding (CRF) is needed to keep the generation assets in good condition for its present use, based on facility life cycles. Plant adaptation funding (building code and standard compliance as well as changing programmatic requirements) should be planned at 1% to 1.5% of the total plant replacement cost. 14 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 14 of 33 | 5.0 D&A DATA & ANALYSIS 5.1 Stormwater Management Sub-Element STORMWATER ANALYSIS The Stormwater Master Plan and subsequent stormwater permit were generated in the early 1990s based on projected development within the campus. The University is divided into four major drainage basins and three sub-basins, as shown on Figure 5.1-2. Modifications have been made to the master permit as a result of changes in projected growth and development. The University currently maintains a master stormwater permit (No. 20026) from the SJRWMD. This master permit allows for development within designated stormwater basins as it relates to an approved additional impervious area within each basin. Currently, the permitted impervious impacts are monitor ed by the University and an independent consultant to ensure that permit capacities are not exceeded. The University maintains a current record in plan and table format of existing stormwater facilities and the current permitted impacts. These documents are availabl e to review existing conditions and plan for future development. The drainage sub-basins and the available impervious area in each sub-basin that is still available for development is shown in Figure 5.1-4 and Figure 5.1-5. This information, along with plan data, is maintained by the University and updated as new development impacts the current data. The stormwater system functions in accordance with the existing master permit. No adverse impacts have occurred as a result of discharges leaving University property through the stormwater management system. The UCF stormwater system is in good condition, and its life expectancy is anticipated to exceed 25 years with routine maintenance. The system's discharge points were selected to minimize impacts to adjacent natural resources. The University has made extensive efforts NARRATIVE Stormwater is of concern for two main issues: one related to the volume and timing of runoff water and the other related to potential contaminants and high nutrient content within the water. Stormwater management is intended for flood prevention and water drainage, but also for managing water through efficient infrastructure and low-impact strategies. Campus stormwater is currently managed by LNR (above ground) and UES (subsurface); and retention ponds are cleaned annually. In the first quarter of 2019, the condition of the campus stormwater system was evaluated, issues were repaired, and pipes were flushed. The basin and pond locations are currently maintained within the ArcGIS system. In the unlikely event that additional stormwater ponds are needed, alternative methods of storage may be used, such as the exfiltration system under Garage H. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 15 of 33 | 5.0 D&A to reduce impacts to adjacent resources, including construction or stormwater ponds, maintaining and enhancing existing wetland systems by incorporating them into the master drainage system, restricting post development discharge to less than pre-1985 rates, and providing required water-quality treatment. The University may need to modify the existing master permit to accommodate future expansion in several sub-basins, including the transfer of available impervious areas from one sub-basin to another. SJRWMD has been receptive to transfers, provided the final outfall conditions remain the same and additional treatment is provided in higher pollutant-loading areas. The last major modification to the master stormwater permit was for the proposed widening of Libra Drive from two to four lanes; and created a new basin and pond 4-P and reconfigured the limits on Basins 4-L and 4-M. SJRWMD regulations require stormwater runoff to be treated prior to discharge into any natural wetland or water body, and to maintain a discharge rate less than pre-development condition. The University has maintained a stormwater management facility which accommodates and exceeds SJRWMD criteria for preservation, except for Basin 4-F which is allowed to discharge directly into Wetland W-9. This condition was grandfathered by SJRWMD when the master stormwater system was developed and permitted in 1994. The stormwater system enhances the existing wetlands by providing natural hydration to each system to maintain its biological function. Because the biological function of the existing wetlands was considered in the original permitting design, the University should also consider habitat enhancements for wetlands and other transitional areas (buffers). Habitat enhancements may be part of an academic study program. Stormwater Figures at the end of this element include: Figure 5.1-1 Stormwater Infrastructure Map Figure 5.1-2 Basins, Ponds, and Wetlands Map Figure 5.1-3 UCF 2012 Wetlands Map Figure 5.1-4 UCF 2014 Stormwater Master Plan Figure 5.1-5 Stormwater Master Plan Impervious Area Report DATA & ANALYSIS 5.2 Sanitary Sewer Sub-Element NARRATIVE Wastewater on campus is collected through various-sized gravity sewer mains that feed from student residence halls, concessions, athletics, academic and research facilities, and retail establishments as well as campus thermal and electrical generation facilities. The effluent is then discharged into underground pumping or lift stations through dedicated force mains on campus, ultimately discharging to the Seminole County/City of Orlando Iron Bridge Water Pollution Control Facility (Iron Bridge). 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 16 of 33 | 5.0 D&A The expansion of the existing utility distribution network is directly influenced by the location of new buildings on campus. Because the final locations of proposed buildings are unknown, a sanitary sewer hydraulic study and resulting perfo rmance model will be necessary.20 This model will allow the campus and future design engineering teams to evaluate the hydraulic performance of the campus under a variety of load scenarios and peak conditions. Existing Conditions Conditional needs warrant for dedicated cost centers, phased in over time, to prevent a continuing increase in backlog of deferred maintenance for sanitary sewer infrastructure.21 In the event of a power grid interruption or loss of power, sanitary spills could occur, carrying negative risk and consequences from both regulatory and environmental perspectives, as well as public perception. Funding for lift station renewal (excluding considerations for non- building infrastructure needs) should be earmarked at 1.5% to 2.0% of equipment replacement costs. 22 Capital Renewal Funding (CRF) is required to keep the infrastructure and lift station assets in good condition for its present use, based on facility life cycles. Figure 5.2-1: Exclusive Bulk Wholesale Wastewater Capacity 2018 Twenty-three pump stations collect and lift the effluent out of the low points on campus. The effluent is then pumped through 16\" force mains to a demarcation point located at the corner of McCulloch Road and S.R. 434 prior to being pumped to Iron Bridge. The University also has an extended wastewater collection service area,15 collecting and transporting effluent outside of the main campus. Municipal wastewater servic es were not available in the early 1980's,16 and as a result, the University provides sanitary sewer collection and transportation utility services to Central Florida Research Park (1200-acre campus), a subsidiary of the Orange County Research Development Authority (OCRDA) (1981), 17 and Siemens Quadrangle I (1983)18. The University has a bulk wholesale agreement (2018) with Seminole County to transfer an annual average limit of 1,100,000 gallons per day (GPD) of wastewater to Iron Bridge. UCF may also purchase up to an additional 700,000 GPD until December 31, 2040. 19 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 17 of 33 | 5.0 D&A DATA & ANALYSIS 5.3 Potable Water Sub-Element NARRATIVE Today, the University owns and operates a water treatment plant that can process up to 3.2 million GPD. The existing system consists of four wells that pump from the Floridan aquifer to elevated storage tanks (200,000 gal) and ground water storage tanks (100,000 gal), with pump capacity of 2,200 gallons per minute (GPM). The maximum annual ground water withdrawal from the Floridan aquifer system for commercial, industrial, and institutional use is limited to 256.5 million gallons per year (MGPY). 23 The University is approaching the limit of its existing Consumptive Use Permit (CUP permit No. 2-095-3202-11) based on historical and permitted peak capacities. UCF needs a larger groundwater storage tank for furnished water, due to potable water capacity constraints and increasingly-stringent regulation changes in water quality parameters, as monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The domestic water system serving UCF is monitored, controlled, and maintained by the University, and is held to the same rigorous testing standards as municipal water systems under Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) drinking water standards. Each year, the University provides a C onsumer Confidence Report to inform the public about water quality and services delivered. As regulation requirements continue to become more stringent, the University must prepare for additional advanced treatment to meet the unfunded mandates from the EPA. Over the last several years, the EPA has required UCF to monitor unregulated contaminants through the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule 24. This necessitates additional capital investment into infrastructure, technology, and treatment systems to monitor and collect data and fulfill these requirements. The University employs an Inter-local Emergency Interconnection Agreement with Orange County Utilities. A control valve (24\") allows UCF to switch to Orange County potable water during emergencies. 25 Orange County water is then provided through the UCF-owned and -operated booster pumping station, to provide supplemental system pressure. The University also purchases water from Orange County, with capacity charges paid for the use of up to 145,453 GPD. The Hercules and Nike residence halls are supplied by this municipal water service. 26 Existing Conditions - Water Infrastructure Campus water pipe distribution extends over 21 miles of the Main Campus, serving the majority of the University along with Siemen's Quadrangle I, and as an emergency interconnection supply to the Central Florida Research Park. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 18 of 33 | 5.0 D&A Indoor Water Use Reduction Potable water usage in buildings constitutes a large portion of freshwater consumption at the U niversity. As campus growth continues to increase, existing campus buildings will require mechanical, electrical, and plumbing renovations and reprogramming in pursuit of pre-eminence. The installation of new plumbing fixtures (urinals, private lavatory faucets, and showerheads) that meet or exceed the EPA WaterSense Label 32 will The expansion of the existing utility distribution network is directly influenced by the location of new buildings on campus. Because the final locations of proposed buildings are unknown, a potable water hydraulic study and resulting per formance model are recommended prior to approval of any new construction. Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability The University should continue to rely upon land use density 27, high- performance building programs as identified in the CMP, and ongoing implementation of Capital Plans and Programs to address the limited potable water capacity as constrained by SJRWMD. Strategic focus should adhere to the latest green building industry standards to treat water \"efficiency first\" with respect to conservation initiatives. UCF must holistically evaluate indoor, outdoor, and specialized water uses, while deploying advanced metering 28 to protect the Floridan Aquifer and the state's precious water resources. Moreover, the SJRWMD has made an aggressive effort to conserve and protect the Floridan Aquifer s ince 2001. The University will have to continue to re-prioritize growth needs, and capital means to supply these future water demands, 29 as UCF and the Central Florida region have experienced rapid growth since the mid 2000's and the SJRWMD has reduced UCF's CUP capacity 37% since 2006. Pursuant to the CUP, the SJRWMD authorizes UCF to use 256.5 MGPY of groundwater to be drawn from the Floridan Aquifer for commercial, industrial, and institutional use; 20.0 MGPY for aquaculture use; and 23.8 MGPY for back-up landscape irrigation use. 30 Figure 5.3-1 LEED-Certified Projects demonstrating the Water Efficiency Credit reduction in water use over a code-compliant building 31 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 19 of 33 | 5.0 D&A significantly reduce consumption by as much as 20-50%, when compared to code compliant fixtures.33 Since 2009, UCF has further reduced fixture and fitting water use from the calculated baseline (code-compliant building) adhering to the latest version of the U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) Indoor Water Use Reduction Water Efficiency credit, achieving 20-52% reduction over the baseline in all new capital projects that are eligible to participate in the program requirements. Outdoor Water Use Reduction (Irrigation) The University has transitioned irrigation for much of the campus from potable to reclaimed water; with the exceptions of the Arboretum, where food is harvested for human consumption, and the Recreation and Wellness Center pool perimeter (as required by health codes). Irrigation practices had previously consumed large quantities of the campus's potable water. LNR has adopted industry best management practices for landscaping. Responsible landscape designs and the use of native, adapted, and drought-tolerant plants have dramatically reduced, and in some cases eliminated, the need for irrigation, while integrating building sites into their surroundings more effectively. Native plants also tend to require less fertilizer and fewer chemical pesticides, which degrade water quality when carried away in stormwater runoff. Figure 5.3-2 Main campus reclaimed water use (millions of gallons) dating back to 2008 Specialized Water Use Reduction (Cooling Tower Water Use) The campus district energy network (chilled water) provides centralized cooling to 54 buildings on the main campus, servicing five million square feet of space. It employs a refrigeration system that removes heat by an evaporative process through the use of multiple cooling towers located at each of the generation facilities. 34 The water used in the cooling towers accounts for over 50% of the University's annual CUP allocation. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 20 of 33 | 5.0 D&A The University determined that reclaimed water can be used to augment the potable water supply required in the cooling towers, thus reducing water consumption against the CUP. 35 With this intention, the Seminole County - UCF Bulk Wholesale Wastewater and Reclaimed Water Service Agreement was approved by the Seminole County Board of Commissioners. UCF can now receive up to two million gallons of reclaimed water per day for specialized uses (such as the evaporative cooling process) until December 31, 2040. Water efficiency and conservation efforts at UCF will require continuous evaluation to identify and implement alternatives to potable water in response to stringent changes made by the Florida water management districts, FDEP's changes in drinking water quality standards, water conservation, changes to the Florida Building Codes, and aggressive reduction efforts championed by national green building standards. Most importantly, water conservation is a mandatory operating condition of the CUP that expires in 2036. DATA & ANALYSIS 5.4 Solid Waste Sub-Element NARRATIVE The University's goal is to develop an environmentally- and economically-sustainable material s-recovery program and become a Zero Waste Campus through campus-wide promotions and recycling opportunities. Although great progress has already been made, UCF has also partnered with Orange County to work toward a greater impact than just UCF. Just the Facts... The average person generates about 4 pounds of trash every day. The EPA estimates that 75% of waste is recyclable, and UCF currently recycles approximately 30%. Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to power a TV for 3 hours. One ton of recycled paper: Saves 7,000 gallons of water Saves between 17 and 31 trees Prevents 60 pounds of pollutants from entering the atmosphere Several campus entities contribute to the effort to reach our recycling goals. UCF Recycling Services, Environmental Health and Safety (EHS), and UCF Surplus Property work together as follows: Non-Hazardous Recycling UCF Recycling Services, a unit of Facilities Operations, operates a robust recycling program. The UCF recycling program includes: Plastics #1 through #7 (tubs, jugs, jars, bottles, etc.) Mixed Paper (office paper, books, magazines, phonebooks, newspaper, cereal boxes, paper egg cartons, paper bags, milk cartons, juice cartons, etc.) Corrugated cardboard Glass (bottles and jars) 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 21 of 33 | 5.0 D&A Scrap metal (steel cans, aluminum cans, loose metal lids, steel bottle caps, clean balled aluminum foil, empty aerosol cans) Hazardous Recycling EHS recycles hazardous materials that are ignitable, corrosive, toxic, or reactive, specifically: Batteries Light bulbs and ballasts Chemicals (laboratory, housekeeping, landscaping, antifreeze) Specialty Recycling UCF Surplus Property handles the transfer or disposal of property, equipment, or other assets for which the originating department no longer has a justifiable use. UCF Surplus Property collects and repurposes: UCF Logo items Electronics (E-waste) Furniture and large items Burn boxes Surplus property recycling is gov erned by statutes and regulations including three (3) Florida statutes (F.S. 273.04 Property Acquisition, F.S. 273.05 Surplus Property, and F.S. 273.055 Disposition of State-Owned Tangible Personal Property) and one UCF regulation (7.302 Surplus Property).

Historically, the peak summer demand (August and September) for refrigeration (cooling) of campus is approximately 20,000 GPM and 15,000 tons, serving the energy needs of 54 campus buildings with approximately five million gross square feet. A prioritized program for long-term guidance for building, expanding, and upgrading the district system is dependent on additional campus load growth, as such District Energy Plant (DEP) IV cooling and heating capacity was built incrementally to add up to 4,000 tons of additional cooling capacity and 7,885 MBh 36 of heating capacity for future needs.37 Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability A robust district energy system is both necessary and integral to UCF's Collective Impact Strategic Plan and Climate Action Plan, providing the necessary flexible platform to integrate multiple resources (renewable energy, combined heat and power, and thermal-energy storage) to provide the University with a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable campus and support the core missions of research and education. The District Energy approach of generating chilled water centrally is more energy-efficient than using in-building equipment; thus, environmental impacts are reduced. 38 Greater efficiencies are possible when using larger, more efficient equipment and with the 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 23 of 33 | 5.0 D&A Figure 5.5-1 District Energy Plant (DEP) Capacities Description Plant Capacity Build-Out Capacit y DEP I 8,000 8,000 DEP II 4,000 4,000 DEP III 4,000 4,000 DEP IV Cooling Capacity 4,000 8,000 DEP IV Heating Hot Water Capacity Installed 5,257MBh 10,514 MBh DEP IV Heating Hot Wate r Capacity Available 2,628MBh Peak Cooling Demand 15,000 Available Cooling Capacity (N+2) 490 Subscribed Cooling Capacity 510 Total Refrigerated Tons (RT) 20,000 RT 24,000 RT ability to stage equipment to match the load while remaining within its highest efficiency range. The district cooling system allows UCF to incorporate peak shifting technologies such as thermal energy storage, to reduce the cost of energy purchased from Duke Energy Florida. 39 As UCF centralizes its approach to cooling campus buildings, and phases out in-building equipment, there will be less use of refrigerants that can potentially affect the ozone layer and contribute to global warming. Additionally, the University must inventory, manage, and track refrigerants for regulatory and compliance purposes. Many refrigerants are being commercially phased out as part of the Montreal Protocol. 40 Economic Benefits The University's district energy plants provide economic benefits, including, but not limited to: realizing fiscal economies of scale, when compared to the more conventional, decentralized approach; achieving higher thermal and em ission efficiencies than stand- alone equipment; reducing and eliminating the need for building engineers and operators for in-building HVAC systems; reducing property and liability insurance costs with the elimination of in-building equipment; reducing noise associated with in-building equipment; freeing up space for the building's intended use; and providing asset redundancy to ensure campus cooling. District energy operations at UCF function in an N+2 paradigm to provide greater asset availability. The criteria for evaluating this paradigm is to allow for one machine to be out of service for maintenance, and for a second machine to fail during campus peak cooling demand. This is commonl y referred to as having a firm capacity of N+2, where \"N\" is the number of machines available for use, and N+2 is the total number of machines. By having such redundancy, one chiller can fail, and one can be down for scheduled service at any time of year, without impacting cooling to the campus. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 24 of 33 | 5.0 D&A Infrastructure Improvements The original underground system, much of which was built in the 1970s with additional phases added through the early 2000s, is connected through several underground vaults. The University will need to secure dedicated capital to move toward eliminating these vaults over the next five years, as they pose significant risk to operations (flooding) and the environment (asbestos). New technology has also evolved that allows for more robust and larger pipe-seated isolation valves, thus eliminating the need for the capital necessary to maintain the vaults. Much of the original chilled water distribution from the 1970s contains asbestos-insulated wrapped concrete that should be phased out over the next five (5) years due to age, surface corrosion, operator safety, Existing District Energy System The campus is served by four (4) central chilled water generation facilities through a network of below-ground district chilled water piping systems that spans 15 miles on campus. District Energy Plants (DEP) I-IV were built in 1966, 1994, 2008, and 2018, respectively. The district piping systems are circuitous in nature, following the circular configuration of the campus topography, roads, and walkways. Pipes are composed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and ductile iron, with the majority of the piping being asbestos-insulated wrapped concrete. Cooling energy from the DEPs and thermal energy storage tank (TES) is distributed through district piping systems to the buildings on campus. The majority of campus buildings are also equipped with tertiary pumps, piped in series with the DEP distribution pumps. The tertiary (building) pumps respond through local controls unique to each respective building's piping circuit. Building pipe pressure is monitored to increase or decrease flow rates corresponding to the cooling demands of each building. A small number of campus buildings are not equipped with tertiary pumps, but rely on the district pi ping system pressure, which is generated through the distribution pumps. The University constructed a three-million-gallon thermal energy storage tank in 2009, which stores and cools water at less-costly off-peak electric rates (at night). The water is discharged during the on- peak hours. This allows the University to realize considerable savings by shifting approximately two megawatts of electricity from on- to off-peak, and storing 42-degree water for peak period campus cooling demands. 41 In 2017, to improve the reliability metrics of chilled water distribution, UCF and Duke Energy Florida partnered to separate the distribution feeders at each chilled water generation facility into three (3) separate feeds. In the event of a momentary outage or power outage on the commercial grid, this reduces the negative risk associated with interruption of environmentally-sensitive cooling and dehumidification of campus buildings. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 25 of 33 | 5.0 D&A and deterioration (see Figure 5.5-4 Chilled Water Infrastructure Map - Containing Asbestos). Hydraulic modeling engineering illustrates the current water pressure challenges within the core of campus and northeastern quadrant during peak cooling demands (see Figure 5.5-2 Chilled Water Distribution Map - Pressure Challenges). Performance metrics include peak summer cooling demand, winter tank charge during peak, and winter tank discharge during peak. To prevent HVAC equipment from fouling and organics from forming in the evaporative distribution network, distribution flow rate must be a minimum of 5 feet/sec. As illustrated in Figure 5.5-1 Chilled Water Infrastructure Map - Current Pressure Deficiencies, several portions of campus are well below the desired flow rate. To combat this issue, right-size piping 42 is necessary to replace existing pipe, in addition to adding hydraulic flow relief through new infrastructure to support the system's peak cooling loads. Chilled Water Figures at the end of this element include: Figure 5.5-1 Chilled Water Infrastructure Map - Current Pressure Deficiencies Figure 5.5-2 Chilled Water Distribution Map - Pressure Challenges Figure 5.5-3 Chilled Water Infrastructure Map - Pipe Age Figure 5.5-4 Chilled Water Infrastructure Map - Mains Containin g Asbestos DATA & ANALYSIS 5.6 Electrical Power and Other Fuel Sub-Element NARRATIVE The University purchases electricity from Duke Energy Florida through a Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff for General Service Time of Use (GSDT-1) (a general service demand rate class) and Stand by Service (SS-1). As such, the energy and demand component s of the University electric billing is further apportioned by an on-peak period and a base period, and is categorized according to season: April to October (summer) and November to March (winter). An important operating characteristic of TOU rates is that electric utilities target or define certain hours by season, month, and period, with the intent to incentivize customers to reduce energy consumption and/or demand with tiered price signals (rates). Weekends and select holidays are considered base hours, the lowest rates. The University owns and operates a 5.5 megawatt (MW) combined heat and power plant (CHP), employing a natural gas combustion reciprocating engine to provide on-site electrical and thermal generation. Due to overall efficiency of the CHP, lower (historic) natural gas price signals, and generation of power on campus (which reduces line loss), UCF has avoided purchasing more of its electricity from Duke 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 26 of 33 | 5.0 D&A Energy. At present, the CHP is electrically connected to the Duke Energy substation (UCF South), feeder W1016, reducing the purchased load from Duke Energy when the CHP is operating. The rapid growth of distributed solar generation and utility-scale solar has the potential to influence retail electricity price structures. Prior to the emergence of renewable installations, rates were structured and designed to make utilities whole by relying on volumetric tariffs. UCF is a top-15 customer in the Duke Energy Florida Territory based on annual electric sales. With volumetric designs in mind, large customers such as UCF with higher consumption contribute more to recovery of utility infrastructure subsidized through the commercial rate base. Existing Conditions of the Electrical Infrastructure Duke Energy Florida feeds power to UCF through two of its owned and operated substations: UCF South (near Facilities and Safety) and North (near Spectrum Stadium). The high-side operating voltage of both substations is 69 kilovolts (kV) and voltage is transformed (stepped down) to 12.47 kV. From the substations, six UCF feeder lines distribute the power to all campus locations. UCF North feeds four circuits labeled as W0940, W0942, W0982 and W0989, while UCF South feeds the remaining two circuits, W1014 and W1016. The UCF-Duke Energy commercial grid distribution system was designed with multiple redundancy features. Manual switching options allow for each substation (and its respective circuits) to carry the full UCF electric load. The switching capabilities also facilitate maintenance functions and minimize the duration of electrical outages. The University leases equipment from Duke Energy, including approximately 70 medium voltage distribution switches and approximately 122 distribution transfo rmers. Duke Energy charges UCF approximately $82k per month ($988k annually). The lease fee covers existing Duke Energy equipment (distribution switches and transformers) and new equipment as required (or as requested by UCF) to meet electrical power and distribution requirements. The lease is periodically adjusted based on equipment changes (new additions, replacement / repairs and removals). Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability The University must shift its paradigm toward carbon-free distributed generation facilities with higher efficiencies; thereby reducing energy cost; improving infrastructure resiliency through grid-strengthening projects; and providing portfolio flexibility with campus energy mixes deploying both smart and microgrid applications. More information on smart and microgrid applications can be found in element 9.0 CONSERVATION. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 27 of 33 | 5.0 D&A Both substations (South and North) also serve non-UCF feeder circuits, so the total capacity of the substation is not dedicated to UCF (see Rated Capacity). Therefore, all projections of available and excess capacity in this Section are dependent on Duke's forecasts for their rate base. It is certain that UCF's planning for future load growth must be conducted in concert with Duke Energy's planning staff. Figure 5.6-1 Substation Peak Loading Substation Feeder Summer Peak Load (MW) Rated Capacity (MW) Percent Utilized UCF South W1014 1% UCF North W0982 13.3 50% UCF South TOTAL 11.9 26.6 45% UCF North TOTAL 10.1 53.2 19% The revenue forecast is based on UCF's conservative electrical load growth of 0.3% per year and an annual electric rate increase of 2.0% per year 43. Figure 5.6-2 UCF's Purchased and Produced Energy and Demand Load Profile DATA & ANALYSIS 5.7 Natural Gas Sub-Element NARRATIVE UCF owns, operates, and maintains a natural gas distribution network on campus, and distributes gas supplied by TECO Peoples Gas through more than 24,000 linear feet of low-, medium-, and high-pressured pipeline. 44 The system serves academic and research buildings, food service operations, and the combined heat and power plant.45 A secondary service supplied, owned and operated by TECO Peoples Gas includes much of Greek Park, Knights Plaza, Towers I-IV, Additions Arena, and UCF Athletics on the north end of campus. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 28 of 33 | 5.0 D&A Because natural gas is deregulated in Florida, UCF has been able to reduce its natural gas costs by leveraging competition among natural gas marketers and suppliers through contract negotiations on the open market. Natural gas provides greater efficiencies than electricity when comparing their use for the same applications. Due to its lower cost, natural gas is used as a primary fuel source to power UCF's combined heat and power plant; feed boilers for domestic hot water heating, building heating and dehumidification processes; and to operate gas appliances in kitchen and concession areas. The University's natural gas system is designed and sized to service only the UCF campus, but may be expanded to serve the demands created by its future growth. 46 Based on a life cycle cost analysis and geographical location, it is strongly recommended that all future buildings and renovations on campus either employ hot water heating through hydronic means fueled by natural gas, or through the District Energy Plant IV's centralized hot water heating loop. 47 The expansion of the existing gas utility distribution network is directly influenced by the location of new buildings on campus. Because the final locations of proposed buildings and renovations are unknown, a natural gas analysis shall be completed using GasWorks 48 to understand the distribution pressure relationships and system performance scenarios prior to approval of any new construction. DATA & ANALYSIS 5.8 Telecommunications Sub-Element NARRATIVE A facility capacity analysis, by geographic service area indicates capacity surpluses and deficiencies: 1. Existing conditions, based on the facility design capacity and the current demand on facility: The Telecommunications infrastructure consists of an underground network of encased duct banks and Maintenance Holes interconnecting the majority of the buildings on all campuses, including but not limited to: Main Campus, Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona, UCF Downtown, Rosen School of Hospitality Management, and several satellite campuses. This interconnection of Telecommunications utility pathways serves all buildings and major Nodes. All Telecommunications infrastructure and services are distributed over the campus fiber optic backbone throughout the encased duct bank system. Services such as Voice, CATV, emergency services, data network (wired and wireless) are all delivered over the fiber backbone along with associated network electronic equipment. These systems are maintained through a fiber mesh topology that terminates at several geographical nodes on all campuses. Each 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 29 of 33 | 5.0 D&A of these nodes connects to main entry points on each campus and they interconnect in a ring topology around the greater Orlando area. 2. The end of the planning time frame, based on the projected demand at current level of service standards for the facility, projected student populations and land use distributions, and any available existing surplus facility: In 2014, UCF IT Telecommunications created a master campus plan for all fiber optic and copper cabling on campus. This level of planning includes a secure and robust main backbone that accounted for ten to twenty years' worth of Telecommunications services growth. In addition, UCF IT created a formula-based system for all new buildings with regard to the amount of fiber, copper and other backbone cabling required for each building. This plan included the location or \"Node area\" that each building would cable back to on each campus. This design allowed other teams to be prepared for growth on systems and various telecommunications services as additional buildings interconnect to each node. UCF IT Telecommunications expects to continue the use of the existing fiber optic cabling and reduce the overall amount of copper cabling between a Node and building. However, technology advancements or new service requirements cannot always be predicted and may involve a change in current plans. The encased duct bank does allow for a low-cost change of cable media between buildings. The general performance of existing telecommunications systems and facilities, evaluating the adequacy of the current level of service provided by the facility, the general condition and expected life of the facility, and the impact of the facility upon adjacent natural resources, will continue to be evaluated. UCF IT Telecommunications continues to design, install, and support this infrastructure throughout all campus locations. The level of service provided is high. With the addition of 811 service to UCF campus locations, Telecommunications remains the only owner-provided locator on campus and there is no reason to change this methodology in the foreseeable future. In addition, UCF maintains detailed sub-system CAD and map drawings. Recently the department has been mapping GPS coordinates for maintenance holes and encased duct bank paths. UCF IT Telecommunications purchased locator equipment that maps each cable to which a device is connected. This locator equipment allows the department to continue mapping the campus in real time. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES ENDNOTES 30 of 33 | 5.0 ENDNOTES ENDNOTES - Technical Information & References 1 ASHRAE District Cooling Guide - Comprehensive Reference. 2 UCF Collective Impact 5-year Institutiona lization Plan 3 UCF Collective Impact Strategic Plan 2016 4 The Utility Master Service-Level Disclosure is currently under review by UCF Administration. 5 Per UCF Policy 3-303, University Co ntrolled Utilities and Interconnection. 6 UCF Collection Facilities is defined in the Seminole County / University of Central Florida Exclusive Bulk Wholesale Wastewater and Reclaimed Water Service Agreement as the equ alization basin, gravity line s, pipes, pump stations, force mains, meters, and appurtenant equipment owned, operated, and maintained by UCF to collect sewage and to transmit it to Iron Bridge. 7 ANSI / ASHRAE / USGBC /IES Standard 189.1 - Standar d for the Design of High-Performance Green Buildings. 8 Pursuant to Consumptive Use Permit Number 2-095-3202-11. 9 St. Johns River Water Management District Consumptive Use Permit Number 2-095-3202-11. 10 The Florida Legislature, through the Energy, Climate Change and Economic Security Act of 2008, established a statewide weight-based recycling goal of 75% by 2020. The Act instituted the 75% recycling goal, directed the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to establish a reporting protocol and directed counties to report annually. 5.0 Utility Infrastructure Overview 11 Site corrosivity was evaluated in 2017 on the oldest sections of the water di stribution system (~51 years old). Soil resistivity testing was conducted using the 4-pin Wenner method. Many of the selective samples were categorized as moderately to mildly corrosive (2,300 - 15,000 Ohm-cm). The soil statistical analysis conducted also yielded at 7.4% change of severely corrosive soil within the campus limits. Soils found deeper were more corrosive. Additionally, the predicted corrosion rate of metallic buried pipe in the soil of the UCF campus was generally low. Corrosion coupons (pre-weighed and measured metal strips mounted in the existing pipes) were used to evaluate the extent of corrosion, showing minimum corrosion after 15 years of serv ice. Direct examination of the oldest pipe known (~49 years in service) showed general corrosion. 12 As the UCF campus grows, an expanded distribution networ k will also be required to connect campus water utilities to the new building locations. The existing piping network is configured overall in a loop with some dead-end legs. A looped piping network is beneficial because it allows portion of the campus to receive potable water if part of the network is isolated or taken out of service. 13 ASHRAE District Cooling Guide - Comprehensive Reference 2.14. 14 ASHRAE District Cooling Guide - Comprehensive Reference 2.14. Best management practices through the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning En gineers (ASRHAE) suggest that 2.0% - 3.0% of the total energy cost is required to alter UCF's utility generation faci lities to comply with changing regulations in order to meet new University expectations, and serve changing programmatic needs. 15 UCF Service Area is defined in the Seminole County / University of Central Florida Exclusive Bulk Wholesale Wastewater and Reclaimed Water Service Agreement as the service area serving UCF and Central Florida Research Park, hereby referenced as the Orange County Research and Development Authority, and Siemens Corporation in the Quadrangle. 16 These partnerships, established in the early 1980's, were determined critical to the success of UCF's strategic partnerships with the space program's research, optics, aerospace, and mechanical engineering disciplines. As a result, they were connected to UCF's sanitary system. 17 Utility Service Contract - Orange County Research Park Development Authority (ORDPA): executed March 13 1981, with addenda in 1984, 1985, 1991, 1996, and 2004. Note: several attempts to modify the contract have been considered since 2015 with no prevail. Perpetual term, OCRPDA load growth, and capacity is of concern. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES ENDNOTES 31 of 33 | 5.0 ENDNOTES 18 The original 1983 agreement was terminated and a new Service Level Water and Wastewater Agreement between University of Central Florida and Siemens Corporation and FT-Orlando Property LLC was executed on 6/16/2017. 19 2018 Seminole County - UCF Bulk Wholesale Wastewater and Reclaimed Water Service Agreement. 5.2 Sanitary Sewer Sub-Element 20UES strongly recommends that all future campus growth be entered into a hydraulic model such as SewerCAD, or a similar modeling program. This model would be used to further develop distribution design parameters, including the sizing of lift station pumps, and would serve as a baseline tool that the campus can use going forward as expansion continues. Hydraulic modeling will allow the campus to optimize the size and routing of the di stribution system and provide the highest level of efficiency and operational flexibility possible. It will also identify distribution limitations in the sanitary sewer piping network, such as pinch points and capacity issues, and identify and model potential system improvements. 21 As the UCF campus grows, expanding the wastewater tr ansportation and collection network must be considered, including additional lift stations and back-up generators for additional resiliency and reliability in the event the commercial power grid goes down. 22 ASHRAE Fundamentals of Building Operation Maintenance and Management. 5.3 Potable Water Sub-Element 23 Maps of the potable water well locations have been removed from the CMP for security purposes. 24 EPA uses the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCM R) to collect data for contaminants that are suspected to be present in drinking water and do not have health-based standards set under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). 25 Bona-fide emergency is classified as when the UCF water treatment plant suffers a loss of system pressure, and is unavailable, and/or unable to augment syst em campus fire suppression capacity. Additionally, a 16-inch looped water main system was connected to the Orange County Utilit ies (OCU) to provide fire suppression backup water. 26 Capacity is expressed in the Emergency Potable Water Supply Interconnect Agreement between Orange County and University of Central Florida. Orange County Utilities stat ed in January 2019 that the east Orange County treatment facilities do not have additional CUP capacity to support any additional growth at UCF. 27 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is the ratio of a building's total floor area (gross floor area) to the size of the piece of land upon which it is built. Walkable urbanism and healthy transit require FARs to be at least 1.5 to 3.0. 28 Advanced water metering supports the University's water management and identifies opportunities for additional water savings by tracking water consumption. 29 St. Johns River Water Management District -November 2006 CUP 2-095-3202-7, capacity of 440.14 MGPY. 30 St. Johns River Water Management District Consumptive Use Permit Number 2-095-3202-11. 31 Projects that are eligible for LEED BD&C Certification, includes LEED Versions 3.1 and 4. 32 The WaterSense Label was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 33 Water Efficiency is addressed in the LEED Reference Guide for Building Design and Construction and LEED Reference Guide for Operations and Maintenance. 34 Evaporative cooling systems remove heat from air to cool in terior building spaces. This heat is expelled into the atmosphere through campus cooling towers. A cooling tower or evaporative condenser removes heat in part by evaporating water; as the water absorbs heat it changes from a liquid to a vapor. As the water evaporates, however, dissolved solids become more concentrated in the remaining water and eventually begin to deposit scale on the cooling towers or evaporative condenser elements, maki ng such systems less efficient. To prevent building of deposits, cooling tower and evaporative condenser systems remove a portion of the water through a process called blowdown. Make up water is then added to replace evaporative losses and blowdown volume. The University has third-party chemical treatment contract with U.S. Water Services Corporation which calls for ~ 3.0- 3.5 cycles of concentration before blowing down the cooling tower to the sanitary sewer. 35 U.S. Water Services Corporation (2018): Reclaimed water requires advanced water treatment chemical monitoring to include pH adjustment to ~8.2, conductivity, inhibitors, autonomous chemical pump activation, injecting 50% acid to help control calcium phosphate, ORP control and flow monitoring for upset condition(s). Additionally, using reclaimed water will increase the cycles of concentration from 3 - 5 cycles using a 50% acid concentrate. 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES ENDNOTES 32 of 33 | 5.0 ENDNOTES 5.5 Chilled Water Production Sub-Element 36 MBh is 1000 BTU / hr. 37 ASHRAE District Cooling Guide: Energy Table 2.1 Approxim ate Unit-Area Cooling-Load Values for college campuses range from 400 (low) - 240 (high) ft2/ ton (non-laboratory space). 38 Water-cooled district energy systems empl oy cooling towers, resultin g in higher efficiency than air-cooled chillers. Water-cooled chillers are more efficient because they condense depending on the ambient temperature bulb temperature, which is lower than the ambient dry bulb temp erature. The lower the ambi ent temperature at which a chiller condenses, the mo re efficient it is. 39 UCF's thermal energy storage tank provides an electrical peak shifting strategy based on its time-of-use (TOU) tariff with Duke Energy Florida. The GSDT-1 tariff is based on time of day, and includes seasonal peak periods (summer and winter) where the energy and demand charges are higher than off-peak. This serves to incentivize large customers, including UCF, to reduce peak demand and electrical production from Duke Energy Florida. 40 The Montreal Protocol (MP) was established and ratified by the U.S. in 1988. The MP global agreement protects the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. 41 The thermal energy storage tank is equivalent to appro ximately 2,000 tons of refrigeration while discharging, and requires over 3,000 tons of refrigeration while charging. This capacity does supplement the available refrigeration capacity, but is dependent on available capacity to charge on a daily basis. 42 Same volumetric flow at larger diameter would reduce flow velocity. 5.6 Electrical Power and Other Fuel Sub-Element 43 Duke Energy Florida has filed for rate increases every four to five years to earn its allowed rate of return. The most recent filing was in 2017 for approximately 8.5%. Burns and McDonnel has conservatively assumed a 2% average annual base rate increase over the 25-year forecast; however, it is expected that rate increases will occur every four to five years. Fuel-related costs in Duke's tariffs are expected to increase 1% per year over the next five years, based on forward price curves for Florida. 5.7 Natural Gas Sub-Element 44 Typical natural gas operating pressures are 5-130 pounds per square inch (PSI). 45 Peoples Gas System Index of Rate Schedules.

In order to evaluate the existing conditions of the transportation facilities on campus, as well as those external facilities and systems lo cated within the Context Area, an inventory of the existing transportation systems and campus demographic data was performed. Campus Population - Enrollment and Employment Student enrollment headcount on the Main Campus was 54,324 in Fall 2018, which equates to approximately 37,057 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) students 11. 11 FTE totals are based on 40 undergraduate annual student credit hours and 32 graduate student credit hours produced in live (non-Web) course sections on the UCF Main Campus, for fundable and non-fundable student credit hours. TRANSPORTATION NARRATIVE Since its inception in 1963 as the Florida Technical University, the University has experienced tremendous growth, and is now the largest state university in Florida with an enrollment of more than 68,000 students. Enrollment projections for the Main Campus during the 10-year planning timeframe can be found in 1.0 INTRODUCTION. An increasing student population results in increased demands on infrastructure, such as new and improved roads, pedestrian walkways, bicycle facilities, transit improv ements, and parking. The University has added significant transportation infrastructure to accommodate this growth, including Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies to decrease the use of single-occupant vehicles and encourage multimodal travel. The University of Central Florida maintains a network of internal roadways, as well as a fleet of over 49 shuttle buses that provide a critical transit mode to and from the campus. In addition, the University also maintains an extensive network of pedestrian and bicycle facilities on campus. With a growing student population, the University strives to integrate and coordinate all available modes of transportation within and surrounding the campus. The area that will be examined by this transportation element is shown in Figure 6.0-12 Context Area Map. Data & Analysis includes the following: Existing conditions Planned improvements Sustainable transportation approaches Future conditions 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 13 of 30 | 6.0 D&A Additionally, there are about 12,000 permanent and temporary employees on the Main Campus. a. Traffic Circulation Systems For the purposes of this Transportation Element, traffic circulation system will be defined as all roadway facilities within the University Campus boundaries, as well as within the Context Area (see Figure 6.0-12 Context Area Map). An inventory of the existing roadway facilities located within the Context Area is shown in Figure 6.0-1 Roadway Facility Inventory Table. This inventory includes the following roadway characteristics: roadway name, segment limits, number of lanes, jurisdiction, adopted level of service (LOS), and functional classification. Functional Classification System The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) defines functional classification as \"the process by which streets and highways are grouped into classes or systems, according to the character of service they are intended to provide.\" Generally, there are six (6) major classifications of roads: Expressway Freeway Principal Arterial Minor Arterial Collector (Major and Minor) Local Road Roadways provide two functions within the functional classification by providing varying levels of access and mobility. The functional classification of a roadway is used to set level of service standards and to evaluate operational characteristics. Figure 6.0-1 Roadway Facility Inventory Table Figure 6.0-1 includes roadway segments 12 on campus and within the Context Area (see Figure 6.0-12 Context Area Map) 12 Although named, UCF's Local Roads are not considered in Fi gure 6.0-1, including East Plaza Drive, Knights Victory Way, Mensa Lane, Pictor Lane, Greek Court, Scorpius Street, Pegasus Drive, Aquarius Agora Drive, Leo Lane, Andromeda Loop, Pyxis Lane, Hydra Lane, Ursa Minor Street, and Ara Drive.

Orion Blvd. 2L UCF Minor Collector E Roadways Figure 6.0-13 Campus Area Roadways Map - by Functional Classification details the functional classification of all study roadways within the Context Area (see Maps & Tables at the end of this element). Roadways within the Context Area for the University's Campus Master Plan include the following classifications: Principal Arterial - This is the highest level of arterial and generally has restricted access, and serves longer distance through trips servicing larger metropolitan areas. This facility type connects minor arterials and freeways as well as other principal arterials. Minor Arterial - This type of roadway provides connections between principal arterials and co llectors. It typically serves moderate distances with less emphasis on mobility than a principal arterial and with a greater level of access to adjacent land parcels. 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 15 of 30 | 6.0 D&A Collector (Major and Minor) - The collector street system provides a combination of land access and mobility, generally within residential neighborhoods, or larger industrial or commercial developments, and joins with other collector systems. Collectors distribute traffic from arterials to the local street system and their final destinations. Local - According to the AASHTO 13 \"Greenbook\", the local street system comprises all facilities that do not fall into one of the higher roadway classifications. The primary function of a local street is to provide direct access to adjacent land uses and to connect to the collector roadway system. Level of Service (LOS) Standards Level of service (LOS) is used to describe a qualitative measure of the operational performance of a roadway under existing or projected traffic conditions. There are six alphabetical LOS designations, A-F, that are used to describe the operating conditions of a roadway. These designations range from the best, LOS \"A\", which represents free-flow conditions, to the worst, LOS \"F\", which represents breakdown conditions with significant delays. For the purposes of this update, this element will follow the LOS standards developed in the FDOT 2013 Quality/Level of Service Handbook (Q/LOS). The FDOT 2013 Q/LOS Handbook includes Table 7 Generalized Peak Hour Directional Volumes for Florida's Urbanized Areas. It shows the existing traffic volumes, roadway geometry and LOS for roadways within the Context Area. Oversized Maps and Tables for Traffic Circulation Systems The following related oversized roadway maps and tables are located at the end of this element: Figure 6.0-10 Existing Roadway Conditions Table details an analysis of existing conditions of the roadways within the Context Area. Figure 6.0-14 Existing Roadway Network and Daily Traffic Volumes Map which identifies the 2019 traffic volumes, roadway geometry, and LOS for roadways within the Context Area. b. Parking Systems The need for large-capacity, well-distributed parking is paramount to support the needs of UCF's students, faculty, staff, and visitors. To accommodate parking demands, both permanent and temporary parking facilities are provided on campus. 13 The American Association of State Hi ghway Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 16 of 30 | 6.0 D&A Parking for nearly 18,600 vehicles is provided on campus in ten (10) garages and more than 60 parking lots and other locations. The sites of UCF's parking garages are depicted in Figure 6.0-15 Existing Parking Structures Map. All parking is indicated on Parking and Transportation Service's Campus Map and Parking Guide .

Parking industry standards indicate that student commuter parking turns over two to four times a day. Because of this turnover, UCF is able to accommodate parking demand for the student population with fewer than 11,000 designated student commuter parking spaces. Student Residential Parking Residential parking, such as Garage E, Garage G, and lots in Greek Park, and Lake Claire Community may be used by students who keep their cars on campus. These areas require Residential parking permits (R, RL, and KP), which may not be used in Student Commuter parking spaces in other campus lots and garages. Faculty and Staff Parking Faculty and staff parking spaces total nearly 11% of UCFs total. All-user parking Some parking spaces, including disabled, overflow, event parking, and motorcycle parking, may be used by all users, including students, faculty, and staff. Specialty Parking Nearly 2,400 spaces on campus serve \"specialty\" uses, including event parking, disabled, motorcycle, reserved, service, metered, health care, and other parking. Figure 6.0-4 shows a breakout of specialty parking spaces by type.

In summary, the study indicated that, in general, the student, faculty, staff, and housing parking lots are more than 70% occupied during most periods of the day, and several are close to full capacity. Peak usage on an average weekday is between 10am and noon; when faculty and student lots were approximately 95% and 92% 14 In Fall 2018, UCF sold 31,821 \"D\" or \"DT\" commuter student permits, and in Spring 2018, 10,314 permits. 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 18 of 30 | 6.0 D&A occupied, respectively. Parking availability was seen in the faculty and student lots after 4pm on most days. c. Transit Circulation NARRATIVE UCF offers various transit options for students, faculty, and staff to travel on- and off-campus. The University is served by both public and private transit systems. The LYNX system provides r egional, public transportation throughout the metropolitan Orlando area, and KnightLYNX (a collaborative effort between LYNX and the UCF Student Government) provides late night, weekend bus service to students on two routes near campus. The University provides transportation for students living in apartment complexes within one mile of campus through the Campus Transit Shuttle system, which includes 15 regular, fixed shuttle routes serving 22 apartment complexes. The University also runs four Pegasus Express shuttles throughout campus for 12 hours per day to alleviate internal roadway congestion. TRANSIT SERVICES Multimodal Centers Multimodal Centers are locations that accommodate transit arrivals and transfers from one means of transit to another. Examples are: UCF/LYNX Transit Center on Leo Lane Research I Bus Terminal on Scorpius Drive LYNX LYNX is the regional, public transit service provider that connects the University to the greater Orlando area, including Downtown Orlando. The LYNX bus service enters the campus via University Boulevard and uses the UCF/LYNX Transit Center, a multimodal hub located near a parking garage, a large surface parking lot, and outer perimeter pedestrian walkways. It is important to note that the LYNX bus routes also have stops near several residential clusters where they may serve students. Link #13: Link #13 is specific to the University, and services the following areas: Primary stops for the link include: Lynx Central Station Colonial Plaza SuperStop Fashion Square Mall VA Clinic Advent Health Winter Park 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 19 of 30 | 6.0 D&A UCF/LYNX Transit Center Link #104 Link #104 stretches from Downtown Orlando at the LYNX Central Station, down to the UCF campus via SR 50, Colonial Drive. Primary stops for this link include: Lynx Central Station Fashion Square Mall Semoran Boulevard and E.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation NARRATIVE The pedestrian and bicycle networks are key components of the University's multimodal transportation system. Since most students, faculty, and staff walk between their destinations, once on campus, it is important that a highly-developed network exist to allow for circulation. The University has developed an intricate network of bicycle and pedestrian paths throughout the Campus, anchored with three concentric paths, Pegasus (400-foot radius), Mercury (800-foot radius), and Aquarius (1,200-foot radius). There is a network of connecting paths that crisscross the campus and connect at significant pedestrian generators such as academic buildings, parking facilities, multimodal centers, and on-campus residential complexes. A map of UCFs intricate sidewalk network can be found at: https://map.ucf.edu/sidewalks/ . See also Figure 6.0-18 Cycling Map. The bicycle/pedestrian network is key to ensuring that all of the other modes that access the campus, such as personal vehicles (via parking facilities) and transit, are used to the fullest. The University has made a significant investment in facilities necessary to encourage pedestrian and bicycle activity. These safe, aesthetically-pleasing facilities are well-used by the student population, as well as by an active cycling community. Many University buildings have one or more bicycle racks located at their entrances. As of Spring 2019, the University provides bicycle racks for approximately 6,500 bicycles. An interactive map for their locations is found at: http://map.ucf.edu/bikeracks/ . 15 Fall 2018 was a full year before the DT Campus opened - ridership was to the Center for Emerging Media (CEM). 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 23 of 30 | 6.0 D&A e. Sustainable Transp ortation Approaches NARRATIVE The University has been developing various mobility options, as well as working to increase the student housing-to-enrollment ratio within the Context Area, to reduce the use of single- occupant vehicles. The primary mobility options and strategies to reduce the dependence upon the personal automobile offered by the University include: Reliable campus shuttle serv ice, with on-campus headways of 10 minutes or less during peak periods and special events, and off-campus headways of 15 minutes to University- affiliated housing and businesses in the Context Area. Robust connectivity via pedestrian and bicycle facilities. UCF Student Government Association and the SWAT committee, in conjunction with the Student Union, offer bike sharing and micromobility programs. Additional sustainable transportation approaches are outlined below: Green Initiative Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations support UCF's commitment to sustainability and clean transportation initiatives. For the 2018-2019 year, the EV charging stations saved 161,060 pounds of CO 2, and 8,300 gallons of gasoline through the use of alternative fueling. Fifteen (15) EV charging stations are located in five (5) high- demand parking areas throughout campus: Parking lot D1 (Memory Mall) Parking lot B6 (Visitor Information Center) Parking lot B1 (Teaching Academy) Parking Garage A (1st level near elevators) Parking Garage D (4th Level) There is an hourly service fee to use the EV charging stations. After a 4-hour maximum charge time, there is a 30-minute courtesy window to relocate the vehicle. Car-Sharing The University is committed to ride-sharing and car-sharing for the reasons outlined below: reducing the demand for parking facilities on campus reducing traffic congestion preserving the environment by reducing gasoline consumption, greenhouse gases, carbon footprint 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 24 of 30 | 6.0 D&A providing economical, stress-free, convenient, and safe alternative transportation for students, faculty, and staff promoting ridesharing reducing wear and tear on personal vehicles Zipcar Zipcar is a membership-based car sharing company providing automobile reservations to its members billable by the hour or day. It is an alternative to traditional car rental and car ownership. Currently, over 700 members actively use the service at UCF. There are nine (9) existing Zipcar vehicles on campus located in lots B9 and H4, and in Garage G. The average utilization rate is 23.24%. Zimride The University initiated a ride sharing program called Zimride. This complimentary program offers students, faculty, and staff the flexibility to use social media networking to share rides to various destinations. To date, 4,330 participants have used this program, as noted at https://new.zimride.com/uc f. Parking Solutions Park and Ride The University has implemented a park and ride system at Lot E- 5, with UCF shuttles readily available to transport students to the multimodal center known as Research I Bus Stop, located between Research I and Parking Garage C. The shuttles operate every 15 minutes and provide students the convenience of peripheral parking and being transported to the inner core. These benefits support the University's mission to reduce vehicular traffic in the inner core of campus. Like intercept garages, Park-and Rides stop cars before they reach the Campus Core, effectively reducing traffic congestion. Transit The University provides high-quality transit for travel between residential areas and parking lots to other on-campus destinations. In conjunction with LYNX, the University continues to improve regional and campus transit service to, from, and within the University. Shuttle Tracking To facilitate UCF Shuttle ridership, buses can be tracked through a website ( https://ucf.crystal-tod.com/rider/ ) and smartphone app (UCF Mobile). Riders can view the shuttles' GPS locations with estimated arrival and departure times, bus stops, vehicle numbers, and shuttle routes. Pedestrian Walkways and Bicycle Paths Residence halls, visitor parking areas, and campus parking lots are connected to other campus destinations via a network of pedestrian walkways and bicycle paths. Bike Parking The University provides bicy cle racks and skateboard lockers adjacent to classroom buildings to encourage non-vehicular circulation. Limited-access Service Roads UCF limits non-service vehicles within the Academic Core to promote pedestrian and bicycle safety. Vehicles with Disabled 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 25 of 30 | 6.0 D&A Parking Permits may park in designated spaces within the Academic Core. Transportation Demand Management (TDM) The University actively promotes TDM strategies both on- campus and in the Context Area. The University has implemented strategies, including, but not limited to: Flextime scheduling for University staff Comprehensive transit and shuttle services Improved pedestrian and non-vehicular facilities Increased number of students living on campus Modifications to class scheduling times Academic Solutions The University has implemented academic solutions to reduce congestion and dependence on personal vehicles. Class Scheduling The University has adjusted class scheduling to mitigate peak- hour traffic conditions and maximize utilization of existing transportation infrastructure. Online Degree Program UCF has robust online degree programs that reduce the need for students to travel to campus. North Campus - Event Traffic and Parking Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village The Kenneth G. Dixon Athletics Village is a mixed-use intercollegiate athletics complex located on the north end of campus. Dixon Village includes the 45,000 seat Spectrum Stadium which hosts UCF home football games. Although the football stadium is a special trip generator, trips occur during non-peak hours. The impacts of the Dixon Village have been incorporated in previous sections of this element. For the purposes of accommodating traffic generated by the stadium, the University has tak en several measures to improve the flow of traffic entering and exiting the campus on game days. These strategies include signage, post-game activities that keep fans on campus and decrease traffic peaks, and the reversal of traffic lanes to double the capacity of roadways. Knight's Plaza Just across Gemini Boulevard and north of Memory Mall is Knight's Plaza, a lively urban environment that hosts more than 200 events per year and includes the following facilities: Additions Arena The Venue Retail and commercial spaces The Towers (4 student residential buildings with over 2,000 units) Three (3) parking garages 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 26 of 30 | 6.0 D&A Event Traffic and parking Major events that occur on-campus and require coordination of guest parking include high school, state college, and University commencements, sporting events, and concerts. UCF garages and parking lots accommodate guests at these events. Future Conditions Future Socioeconomic Conditions Since the 2015-25 CMP update, Main Campus enrollment has increased from ~50,00016 to ~54,000.17 See 1.0 INTRODUCTION for Enrollment Projections for the 10-Year Planning Timeframe. Committed Transportation Improvements Pursuant to a 2016 Campus Development Agreement (CDA), UCF and Orange County identified the following Partnership Projects that will \"improve the road deficiencies outlined in the 2015-25 UCF Campus Master Plan Update.\" (a) Participating in a University Area Pedestrian Safety Study, with UCF undertaking the following: 1) Providing an additional 5 feet of right-of-way beyond FDOT's right-of-way; 2) Designing and constructing the first phase of the Gateway Project, a landing pad and entryway features at University Boulevard and Alafaya Trail; 3) Paying for the installation of recommended mid-block crossings on Alafaya Trail and on University Boulevard; 4) Installing pedestrian-scale lighting within the right-of-way on UCF property along the UCF side of Alafaya Trail; 5) Paying Duke Energy for lighting maintenance and utilities along the UCF side of Alafaya Trail; 6) Contributing to the signalization changes at University Boulevard and Alafaya Trail; 7) Developing and providing educational programs related to pedestrian safety; and 8) Providing wayfinding signage on Alafaya Trail and University Boulevard.

The MetroPlan Orlando Transportation Improvement Program (2019-2023) and the Seminole County Public Works Department report no other programmed improvements for the external facilities located in the Context Area. Future Parking Structures The University will strive to provide additional garage(s) during the 10-year Planning Timeframe, to add 2,000 or more parking spaces. Per this chapter, Policy 2.2.4, The University will not build future parking garages within the campus core...Future garages will be located at the campus periphery. Intercept Garages UCF will embrace the concept of intercept garages, located at the perimeter of campus to reduce the number of vehicles travelling into the campus core, and thereby reduce traffic congestion within the campus. Transportation from these garages to the campus core could include short-headway, zero-emission shuttles, autonomous shuttles, bicycle/pedestrian paths, etc. Locations near these intersections will be studied (not in priority order): Alafaya Trail and University Boulevard Alafaya Trail and Centaurus Boulevard (this garage could also serve events at the future Performing Arts Center) North Orion Boulevard and McCulloch Road (this garage could also serve Intercollegiate Athletics events) Alafaya Trail and Central Florida Boulevard (this garage could also serve events at the RWC Sports Complex) Alafaya Trail and North Gemini Boulevard (this garage could also serve Greek Park) Future garages will be listed on the 10-Year Schedule of Capital Projects (SCP) in element 10.0 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS & IMPLEMENTATION. Horizon YR 2030 Roadway Conditions Year 2030 Offsite Roadway Analysis Pursuant to Florida Statute 1013.30(3), an analysis of the projected impacts of development on offsite infrastructure was conducted for Horizon Year 2030. The following analysis was conducted to project the growth identified in the year 2030 horizon. 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 28 of 30 | 6.0 D&A Background Growth Assessment To determine the background traffic growth through the Horizon Year 2030, the following resources were examined: Based on the latest BEBR 18 projections, the projected population growth rate for Orange County will be 0.88% per year from 2018 to 2030. A comparison of historical traffic counts obtained from either the Orange County or Seminole County Annual Count Programs over the previous planning period resulted in negative annual growth rates or growth rates less than 1% per year within the Context Area. Therefore, based on this assessment, and to provide a conservative analysis, a minimum 1% background growth rate was assumed for all roadways within the Context Area. Multimodal Mobility Plan Assessment Although enrollment has increased since the 2015-25 Campus Master Plan Update was adopted, the University has continued to reduce the use of single-occupant vehicles, resulting in fewer trips in and out of campus. As identified in the Sustainable Transportation Approach section, the University has achieved these reductions through various strategies such as UCF shuttle ridership, Lynx Bus ridership, pedestrian and bicycle trips, park and ride areas, vehicle sharing, online course offerings, and adjustments to class scheduling. UCF average daily shuttle ridership increased from 13,555 to 15,659 when compared to the previous Master Plan. The evidence of these successful strategies is outlined in Figures 6.0-7 and 6.0-8. In the previous planning period (2014 to 2019) , the University generated 0.45 trips per additional student. However, through the strategies highlighted within this CMP, the University has further reduced this trip rate over the most recent 5-year period; and has decreased the total number of trips entering/exiting the campus, while the student population has increased.

Over this period, the number of students increased by 5,324 and 6.0 TRANSPORTATION DATA & ANALYSIS 29 of 30 | 6.0 D&A The University has successfully decreased traffic volumes while increasing enrollment; however, for the purpose of providing a conservative analysis, the future growth traffic due to anticipated enrollment through YR 2030 will be based on the previous planning periods rate of 0.45 trips per additional student. Utilizing this methodology, the resulting growth based on anticipated enrollment is summarized in Figure 6.0-9 UCF Trips based on Projected Student Enrollment. Figure 6.0-9 UCF Trips based on Projected Student Enrollment See 1.0 INTRODUCTION for the method used to project student enrollment throughout the 10-year planning timeframe. 2019 2030 Net Increase Students 54,324 60,60820 6,284 Trips per Additional Student 0.45 Vehicle Trips 76,620 79,448 2,828 This net increase of trips was distributed to the Context Area roadways utilizing the latest Orlando Urban Area Transportation Study (OUATS) transportation planning model. Year 2030 Horizon Year Analysis The 2030 Horizon-Year Traffic Assessment is provided in Figure 6.0-11 Future Roadway Conditions Table, found in Maps & Tables at the end of this element. As shown in Figure 6.0-11, four (4) roadways are projected to operate under adverse conditions, based on the maximum service volumes provided in the 2013 FDOT Quality/Level of Service Handbook. It should be noted that these roadways will operate adversely with or without the anticipated trips generated by the projected student population growth; thus, these roadways should be identified as pre-existing deficiencies. As the University and the surrounding area continue to grow, the University will continue to implement the strategies identified in the Sustainable Transportation Approach section. As evidenced by the comparison of Year 2014 and Year 2019 traffic volumes, the University will continue to promote strategies that reduce the use of the single-occupant vehicle and encourage multimodal travel, therefore further reducing the traffic volumes within the Context Area. the number of vehicle trips entering/exiting the campus decr eased by 6,931. Therefore, the trip rate per additional student was calculated as -6,931/5,324 = -1.30. 20 Projected Enrollment Source: See 1.0 INTRODUCTION, Figure 1.0-1: Main Campus Projected Enrollment 30 of 30 | 6.0 MAPS 6.0 TRANSPORTATION MAPS & TABLES 6.0 TRANSPORTATION Figure 6.0-10 Figure 6.0-10 Existing Roadway Conditions Table Figure 6.0-10 is a detailed analysis of existing c onditions of the roadways within the Context Area,21 including number of lanes, adopted level of service (LOS) standard, peak hour adopted level of service (LOS) standard, current peak hour volumes, and current LOS.

Because of UCF's rapid growth, increased development and infrastructure coordination with the host community and other governmental bodies will be vital to effectively meet future needs. Per Florida Statute 1013.30: The host and any affected local governments include: Orange County (Host Local Government) Seminole County (Affected Local Government) City of Orlando (Affected Local Government) City of Oviedo (Affected Local Government) Other governmental bodies include: Department of Environmental Protection Florida Department of Transportation Department of State Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) East Central Florida Regional Planning Council Seminole County Planning and Development Division Florida Department of Economic Opportunity DATA & ANALYSIS Intergovernmental Coordination and the UCF Campus Master Plan Outreach Program As reflected in the Goals, Objectives, and Policies, the University will continue to develop and implement its community outreach program with respect to the CMP. The University presents the plan at various phases throughout the update process at public hearings, informal information sessions, and neighborhood group meetings. Throughout the update process, coordination with local governments is essential to ensure that all input is considered prior to the plan's final adoption. Intergovernmental Coordination and the Campus Development Agreement (CDA) Per Florida Statutes 1013.30, the University is required to enter into a CDA with local governments that addresses the impacts of University development on local government support infrastructure. Negotiation of the CDA occurs in conjunction with every five-year CMP update, and includes the identification of a process whereby the impacts of development are assessed. The primary purpose of the CDA is for UCF and local governments to identify areas of impact from University-generated development on the 7.0 INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION DATA & ANALYSIS 9 of 10 | 7.0 D&A 1 The UCF/LYNX Transit Center is identified on Google Maps as the UCF SuperStop. local infrastructure system, and to address mitigation for the University's proportionate share of the impacts. The University works closely with local government representatives to ensure that CMP updates are consistent with the CDA, and with state and local comprehensive plans. Intergovernmental Coordination and the UCF Facilities Planning and Construction Website The following documents are located on the Facilities Planning and Construction (FPC) website, under the Planning tab: UCF Campus Master Plan UCF Campus maps 5-year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Campus Development Agreement (CDA) Other planning documents The FPC website is a critical tool that the University uses to communicate with state and local governments, the campus community, and the public. The Universi ty maintains a copy of the UCF 2020-30 Campus Master Plan Update on the website, as required by Florida Statute 1013.30 (3). Intergovernmental Coordination and Transportation MetroPlan Orlando is a regional transportation planning body that leads transportation planning efforts in Orange, Osceola, and Seminole counties, and seeks to address the overall transportation challenges of the rapidly-growing metropolitan area which includes UCF. MetroPlan Orlando instituted a Transportation Systems Management & Operations Advisory Committee (TSMO), of which UCF is a non-voting member. The University participates with LYNX, the local area public transportation entity, and has developed the UCF/LYNX Transit Center 1, a multimodal center on Leo Lane between Garages A and I, to facilitate student, faculty, staff, and visitor use of public transportation facilities. The University will continue to coordinate with local governments looking to interconnect multiuse trail systems through and/or around campus. The University will continue to coordinate with affected state and local governments with regard to transportation issues resulting from University-generated development, including impacts on area and campus roadways, transit, parking, and bicycle/pedestrian facilities. See element 6.0 TRANSPORTATION for University goals, objectives, and policies regarding transportation. Intergovernmental Coordination and Fire Protection The University partnered with Orange County, providing a tract of land in its northeast corner for the Orange County / Seminole County Fire and Rescue Station 65 , which has served the University and nearby neighborhoods since 1999. 7.0 INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION DATA & ANALYSIS 10 of 10 | 7.0 D&A Intergovernmental Coordination and Stormwater Master Planning The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) approved the update to the UCF Campus Stormwater Master Plan in March 2007, thus providing adequate, envir onmentally-sound stormwater management and capacity for current and future campus growth. The update significantly reduces Univer sity-generated offsite stormwater impacts on the surrounding community, as discussed in element 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES. The University will continue to coordinate with state and local governments regarding development within the parameters of the approved Stormwater Master Plan. In addition, the University intends to sponsor public symposia addressing this issue with local stormwater officials and the public. Intergovernmental Coordination and Potable Water and Sanitary Sewer In July of 2009, the University secured a secondary interlocal potable water supply agreement to provide the University with an emergency backup water supply of 145,453 gallons per day. Through coordination with Orange County, UCF provided an easement through its southern property for a new regional water service line. UCF is nearing capacity on its consumptive use permit (CUP), with SJRWMD, for ground water supply. It is integral that UCF partners with the Central Florida region host governments to focus on how to economically generate regional resources and alliances to deploy alternative water extraction methods, as ground water has become a precious and limited commodity. These additional treatment methods will drive purchased water commodity costs. In addition, the University coordinated with the host government and upgraded its sanitary sewer infrastructure by sending its sanitary waste to the City of Orlando's Iron Bridge Water Pollution Control Facility for processing and reuse. As part of that agreement, the University receives treated effluent from Iron Bridge for irrigation and process water uses. Intergovernmental Coordination and Environmental Protection The cumulative growth of the University and its surrounding community has changed the area's character from semi-rural and suburban to an academic urban center. Growth increases the need to coordinate environmental monitoring and conservation efforts. As a center of learning, UCF holds an important position in this partnership. As part of its mission, UCF shall provide critical knowledge and expertise, and demonstrate its commitment to beneficial growth management and concurrency. 8.0 PUBLIC SAFETY 8.0 PUBLIC SAFETY 202030 CAMPUS MASTER PLAN UPDATE CONTENTS INTRODUCTION .................................................................................................................. ........ 1 POLICE, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, AND SECURITY ........................................................ 3 GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES ....................................................................................... 3 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ................................................................................ 4 GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES ....................................................................................... 4 PUBLIC SAFETY ................................................................................................................. ......... 7 DATA & ANALYSIS ............................................................................................................... .... 7 8.0 PUBLIC SAFETY INTRODUCTION 1 of 9 | 8.0 INTRO 1 In 2019, the UCF Department of Security and Emergency Management was split into two separate departments: the Office of Emergency Management and the Department of Security Management.

The University is committed to preserving and enhancing its natural areas and the biological diversity they support. The UCF campus lies at the southern end of the Southeastern Coastal Plain, which was designated as a global \"biodiversity hotspot\" in 2015. Global concern over the loss of biodiversity and habitats due to human activities makes preservation of the campus's remaining natural assets an important goal. The campus contains eleven different types of native ecosystems, including important local examples of the longleaf pine ecosystem, which is considered critically endangered globally. These natural areas contribute importantly to conservation of regional biodiversity, including threatened and endangered species. RELATED ELEMENTS See 2.0 FUTURE LAND USE & URBAN DESIGN for a chart of the acreages of Developed, Developable, and Undevelopable campus lands and the Future Land Use Map. See 5.0 GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES for more information on Energy Infrastructure and Conservation, and Water Use and Conservation. See 6.0 TRANSPORTATION for policies designed to discourage dependence on personal automobiles and to encourage alternative modes of transportation on campus. STATUTE & REGULATION 9.0 CONSERVATION is an element that is required by Florida Statue 1013.30(3). The element must follow the guidelines stated in Florida Board of Governors (BOG) Regulations, Chapter 21. BOG 21.208 states the purpose of the element as follows: \"This element ensures the conservation, protection and wise use of all natural ecosystems and natural resources on the university campus and in the planning study area\". 9.0 CONSERVATION GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 2 of 23 | 9.0 GOP 9.1 CONSERVATION OF NATURA L ECOSYSTEMS AND RESOURCES NARRATIVE The Department of Landscape and Natural Resources (LNR) manages campus natural lands with mechanical vegetation control, prescribed fire (controlled burns), and invasive species removal, and maintains a network of trails, making these areas accessible for nature enjoyment and passive recreation. The University has received state-wide recognition for its land management program, which focuses on conservation management at the urban-wildland interface. The goals and policies for nature conservation presented in this element will enhance the diversity and abundance of native plants and animals living in campus natural lands, and will help establish UCF as a national leader in conservation management and environmental stewardship. Appropriately using and conserving water resources, improving air quality, and preventing or minimizing pollution are key aspects of the University's commitment to co nservation and sustainability. The University's National Discharge and Elimination System Permit, which LNR oversees, guides the University's efforts to protect its surface waters. Air quality is addressed through transportation initiatives, use of alternative fuels and renewables, and the University's Air Operating Permit.

UCF's enormous appetite for energy warrants serious consideration, given the associated environmental and financial impacts. As energy costs and demands continue to grow, achieving energy sustainability has become increasingly important to the University's mission. Appropriate policies and procedures that govern how we use our environmental resources and facilities will enable UCF to achieve the improvements necessary to establis h itself as a national leader in energy research, education, and stewardship. Although this plan focuses on the energy use attributed to buildings and associated systems, the energy and environmental impacts of transportation are equally important. Currently, these two major energy consumers (buildings and vehicles) are largely decoupled, but this will not always be the case. As electric vehicles continue to become more common, the interplay between building and vehicle energy will increase, particularly as UCF builds out its smart-grid infrastructure. 9.0 CONSERVATION GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 8 of 23 | 9.0 GOP As stated in UCF Policy 3-111.1 Energy Sustainability , \"The University is committed to energy sustainability and ensuring a productive environment for all members of the University community. Requirements involving energy conservation are to be followed by all University members, including students, staff, faculty, visiting scholars, and campus visitors.\" Collectively, we owe it to future generations to preserve and protect our finite natural resources, as we are all stewards of this Earth. The energy section of this element describes the state of UCF's energy portfolio and our goals and policies for energy infrastructure, energy conservation, renewable energy generation, and energy storage. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES Energy Efficiency GOAL 1: Reduce campus energy use th rough innovative technologies to achieve Carbon Neutrality by 2050. OBJECTIVE 1.1: Reduce energy use by campus infrastructure, buildings, and systems energy to meet or exceed peer building benchmark Energy Utilization Index (EUI) and Energy Cost Index (ECI) performance metrics. POLICY 1.1.1: All UCF buildings shall be benchmarked to determine energy performance using the ASHRAE Building Energy Quotient database or other appropriate benchmark databases for prioritization of energy efficiency projects and retro-commissioning activities. POLICY 1.1.2: All Building Au tomation Systems (BAS) not adhering to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 135 BACnet\u00ae requirements shall be replaced or modernized to comply, and allow for optimized sequencing of operations, smart-grid integration, enhanced diagnostics, and ongoing monitoring-based commissioning efforts. POLICY 1.1.3: All building lighting systems shall be upgraded to energy-efficient lighting technologies to reduce electrical power and HVAC cooling loads, reduce the maintenance burden of re-lamping efforts, and eliminate the use of mercury-containing bulbs. POLICY 1.1.4: All energy-intensive HVAC equipment shall be upgraded at end of life to meet or exceed the current UCF Design, Construction and Renovation Standards, to reduce energy expenditure and improve Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). POLICY 1.1.5: All campus site lighting (roadway, parking, sidewalks, signage, etc.) shall be upgraded to energy-efficient lighting technologies to improve site lighting characteristics, thus reducing energy expenditure and improving safety. POLICY 1.1.6: All building chilled water connections and associated tertiary pumps shall be modernized to meet both uniform specifications and the UCF Design, Construction and Renovation Standards to improve chilled water usage characteristics, reduce 9.0 CONSERVATION GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 9 of 23 | 9.0 GOP pumping power, and improve the chilled water temperature differential (Delta T). POLICY 1.1.7: All UCF E&G buildings shall be re-commissioned in adherence to the latest version of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 202 and ASHRAE Guideline 0.2 within a three-year cycle to maintain building system performance, document performance degradation due to entropy, and prioritize syst em modernization projects. POLICY 1.1.8: The University shall reduce HVAC loads by raising or lowering the temperature in all non-essential, unoccupied spaces after-hours. The University shall also work with UCF IT to implement computer shutdown protocols for all UCF-owned non-server, non-critical computers and peripheral hardware. POLICY 1.1.9: All energy efficiency building practices shall be guided by ANSI/ASHRAE/ICC/USGBC/IES Standard 189.1 and the latest version of LEED. OBJECTIVE 1.2: Transition electrical power sources from public-utility sourced power to onsite renewable energy and other onsite generation technologies, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving economic stabilization of electrical utility rates. POLICY 1.2.1: A Photovoltaic (PV) Prioritization Plan shall be developed and implemented to install PV on select building roofs, parking garages, and elsewhere as approved by the administration. POLICY 1.2.2: All new construction projects shall be designed and built to be solar-ready. Solar PV points of connection shall be located at the utility transformers instead of at the buildings, allowing for clear demarcation of PV electrical generation systems from building electrical systems. POLICY 1.2.3: Pressure-reducing valves used in the distribution of reclaimed water delivered to UCF from the City of Orlando / Seminole County Iron Bridge Wastewater Treatment Facility shall be assessed and replaced with pressure-reducing turbines for power generation, when economically viable. OBJECTIVE 1.3: Utilize the infrastructure, buildings, and systems as \"living labs\" for academic collaboration and research, in cooperation with Facilities and Safety, for hands-on experiential learning. POLICY 1.3.1: UCF shall continue to develop partnerships between its operations and academic units to enhance the quality of real-world academic applications and foster greater research potential in the areas of utilities, sustainability, and the built environment. POLICY 1.3.2: Utilities and Energy Services (UES) shall continue to work with University Space Administration and the Registrar's Office to optimize space use and planning, reducing energy use associated with under-utilized and unoccupied spaces. Development of an energy-centric space usage policy could result in a significant reduction in campus energy consumption. POLICY 1.3.3: UCF shall continue to pursue human-led energy conservation policies as outlined in the Collective Impact and Climate Action Plans, such as \"Kill-a-watt\" competitions and \"Green Office\" certifications. 9.0 CONSERVATION GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 10 of 23 | 9.0 GOP Microgrids NARRATIVE UCF must shift its paradigm with regards to utility master planning and develop an on-campus microgrid: a small-scale power grid with defined electrical boundaries that can operate independently or collaboratively with both the public utility provider and other microgrids. A microgrid would allow the University to reduce energy costs; improve infrastructure resiliency through grid-strengthening projects; and offer portfolio flexibility with campus energy mixes, deploying both smart and microgrid applications. By using advanced controls and communications to synchronize generation assets to the existing power distribution system, the microgrid allows any excess generated power to be delivered back to its electrical grid. During an emergency situation, UCF's microgrid could disconnect from the local utility power and continue operating as an \"island.\" The maximum continuous demand to be served by the proposed microgrid will depend on how much generation and local battery storage capacity is connected. Additionally, a priority load-shedding scheme would be implemented to avoid overloading the system. Potential sources of power for the microgrid include some combination of cogeneration/CHP, solar, or other renewable technologies. Many microgrids incorporate energy storage as well as energy generation, to compensate for the differences between energy production and demand. Long-term, an assessment of financial focus, operational flexibility, and future outlook is recommended to better position the University for uninterrupted electric and thermal generation under microgrid considerations. This will be essential to protect environmentally- sensitive research, minimize technical risk events, and achieve campus sustainability targets. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES GOAL 1: To transition the campus to a microgrid to synchronize generation assets to the existing medium voltage power distribution system. OBJECTIVE 1.1. Transition the UCF electrical transmission and distribution systems to a Smart Grid model capable of islanding the UCF Main Campus in a \"microgrid\" configuration POLICY 1.1.1 UCF shall evaluate microgrids that incorporate energy storage, as well as energy generation, to compensate for the differences between energy production and demand. POLICY 1.1.2: The University shall analyze the costs and determine whether to continue leasing the on-campus electrical distribution assets from the local utility provider, or buy them outright. Ownership of the assets would allow UCF to upgrade the grid infrastructure as 9.0 CONSERVATION GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & POLICIES 11 of 23 | 9.0 GOP for economic benefit, inclement weather, or other conditions that warrant separation from the public electrical utility grid. needed to incorporate a distributed generation portfolio of PV and realize cost savings. POLICY 1.1.3: UCF shall create a model demonstrating the impact that each new, renewable energy pr oject in development would have on the electrical grid, to ensure grid resiliency and reliability. POLICY 1.1.4: UCF shall consider energy storage technology to achieve greater grid resiliency and reliability. This technology would allow the University to maintain operations in the event of momentary electrical utility interruptions, and consider grid-level energy storage for circuits powering research buildings. POLICY 1.1.5: UCF shall integrate a microgrid-controller interface with the campus's Building Automation Systems, as distributed renewable energy generation is deployed and scale warrants. The interface would allow for dynamic demand response modes, at both the campus and building levels, to reduce peak demand on the electrical utility grid and prevent back feeding. 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 12 of 23 | 9.0 D&A 9.1 CONSERVATION OF NATURA L ECOSYSTEMS AND RESOURCES DATA & ANALYSIS A. Nature Conservation Overview The UCF campus contains significant natural resource areas, many of which are protected from future development. Areas of interest include the Arboretum, preserved upland areas, wetland conservation easements and other wetlands, Lakes Lee and Claire, and campus stormwater ponds. Natural areas not only provide substantial habitat for diverse and abundant plant and wildlife populations, but also offer attractive campus assets for connection with nature and recreational opportunities. The preservation of both the quantity and quality of these resources is vital to the continued ecological function of these resources as well as the quality and character of the UCF campus. Figure 2.0-1 Current Land Utilization Table shows that nearly half of UCF's Main Campus acreage is natural land, uplands, bodies of water, and wetland habitats. One third of these natural areas are preserved in perpetual Conservation Easements to the St. Johns River Water Management District. 1 The remainder of UCF's natural areas, including uplands, wetlands, and wetland buffers, are set aside for long-term preservation, but are not held under a Conservation Easement. The location of various conservation lands on campus are shown in Figure 9.0-4 Conservation Lands Map. Invasive Species LNR maintains a Weed Management Plan that identifies nuisance plant species in the natural lands. All plants list by the 2019 Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council List of Invasive Plant Species are monitored, mapped, and chemically treated yearly. Most of these invasive, exotics are stable or decreasing in coverage due to proactive management, and with support of grant awards from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Threatened and Endangered Plants and Animals All listed threatened and endangered plant and animal species that are observed during annual compliance monitoring and general field observations are documented, mapped, and reported annually. Figure 9.0-5 Map of Threatened and Endangered (T&E) Plants and Animals shows documented locations of T&E plants and animals. 1 For conservation easements in favor of the St. Johns River Water Management District, see UCF Ownership and Encumbrance Report 2019 , items gg. and tt. 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 13 of 23 | 9.0 D&A Monitoring Vegetation monitoring is completed twice a year, in June and December, for compliance monitoring required for environmental permits with the SJRWMD. A total of thirty-nine (39) vegetation plots are located in the natural areas, and data collected is also used for habitat evaluation and restoration research. Gopher Tortoises Gopher Tortoises and their burrows are surveyed and monitored periodically by LNR. Figure 9.0-6 Map of Gopher Tortoise Burrows, at the end of this element, shows locations of gopher tortoise burrows evaluated during surveys of selected natural areas. B. Surface Water Quality The University of Central Florida's water features include twelve (12) constructed stormwater ponds, two natural lakes, and several other natural wetland and stream systems. These water bodies are monitored regularly by LNR and pond management contractors. Periodic measurements of pond and lake systems have included dissolved oxygen, temperature, acidity (pH), conductivity, and turbidity. Routine water samples were collected from ponds from 2012-2014 and analyzed for dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus (Table 9.0-1). The University currently samples Lake Claire and Lake Lee monthly as part of the Florida LAKEWATCH program. Figure 9.0-1: Average Water Quality Data for UCF Water Bodies Water samples were taken at pond outlets. Values represent averages of values from a variable number of sample dates, ranging from 20 to 29 sampling events, taking place over a two-year period from 2012-2014. Surface water body 14 of 23 | 9.0 D&A C. Hazardous Materials and Spill Prevention Underground and Above- ground Tanks The University has a number of above-ground storage tanks associated with diesel generators, lubricant oil, motor vehicle oils, and used oils. All of these tanks are double-walled and range in size from 25 gallons to 5,200 gallons. The University remediated and closed several old underground storage tanks in the 1990s. The current fuel island was installed in 1995 at the Facilities Management Compound. This underground tank has a capacity of 17,500 gallons and is FDEP-compliant. The University continues to maintain and update its Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan. The University inspects and maintains all petroleum storage tanks to prevent oil discharges from occurring. The Department of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) provides training to prepare University personnel to respond in a safe and effective manner to mitigate the impacts of discharge to navigable waterways. Hazardous Materials and Waste By virtue of its academic and research activities, the University uses hazardous materials. All such materials are carefully monitored and regulated such that there is no indication of any prior or current toxic waste problems on the campus property. Environmental Management within EHS is responsible for ensuring the University's compliance with local, state, and federal environmental laws and regulations. Areas covered include hazardous materials storage, hazardous waste management, environmental assessments, site remediation, the investigation and cleanup of contaminated media on state-owned property, storage tanks, environmental health, and regulatory monitoring to track changes to environmental regulations as they relate to environmental compliance. EHS is responsible for the safe and legal disposal of all hazardous chemicals and wastes generated by the University. Various campus departments, particularly those involved in engineering, science, or health-related research, generate hazardous waste. EHS contracts with licensed and permitted contractors for final disposal of these wastes, after they are collected, profiled, and safely characterized. Hazardous material inventory is maintained by laboratory managers and shop managers. The EHS Chemical Safety and Security Coordinator oversees the inventory training, auditing, and outside agency reporting. 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 15 of 23 | 9.0 D&A Air Quality EHS provides monitoring, recordkeeping, and compliance testing in accordance with Air Operating Permit 0950015-009-AO. The University maintains stationary combustion equipment and pollution controls to ensure emissions are within permitted parameters. The University obtains construction permits for new, stationary combustion equipment. 9.2 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY DATA & ANALYSIS D. Ener gy Efficienc y Background UCF is fully committed to an energy conservation and sustainability program based on universal participation and continual improvement. All UCF buildings and facilities are operated with the health, welfare, and safety of all students, faculty, and staff in mind, and in support of instruction and research. Regardless of their sources of funding, buildings will be operated in the most energy-efficient manner possible. Individual and departmental awareness and accountability are essential to the overall success of this initiative. As per University Policy 3-111.1, Energy Sustainability, requirements involving energy conserva tion are to be followed by all members of the University community. Current Energy Use University energy data can be viewed on the Open Energy Information System . Figure 9.0-2 Forecast of Campus Emissions From Campus Energy Use Scope 1: Greenhouse gas emissions from purchased energy sources Scope 2: Greenhouse gas emissions from on-site generation of electricity, heat , or steam 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 16 of 23 | 9.0 D&A Energy Efficiency Projects The University is responsible for coordinating numerous energy initiatives related to green buildings and energy efficiency. This includes capital energy improvement projects, renovations, and equipment replacement; and updates to University policies relating to energy, sustainability, and the built environment. UCF also developed a campus-wide system to track and report its energy utilization, which assists operations staff in optimizing building performance throughout the campus building portfolio; enhancing the University's advantage in energy and environment; and developing internal and external partnerships to creatively implement a broad range of expanded demand-side management initiatives. The University prioritizes energy e fficiency projects in Education and General (E&G) buildings based on the total Operations & Maintenance (O&M) costs normalized per square foot of conditioned space. O&M costs are comprised of all utility costs, as well as costs associated with service and repair work orders. While this method tends to prioritize the smaller, energy-intensive laboratory buildings, those buildings often are prime candidates for energy efficiency projects. Based on this prioritization schedul e, the University benchmarks and conducts ASHRAE Level 1 energy audits. 2 In buildings that are not performing optimally, the condition of the energy-using systems3 contributing to the utility use is assessed. If the systems are still within an acceptable range of life cycle but are underperforming, those buildings are identified as candidates for retro-commissioning (or re-commissioning if they've been commissioned previously). If it is determined that an energy-using system should be upgraded, replaced, or modernized, a Level 2 energy audit 4 is conducted to determine initial budget figures and a scope of work for the design and implementation of Facility Improvement Measures (FIMs). Commissioning Process of New Construction As described in the ASHRAE Commissioning Standards and Guidelines: Standard 202, the Commissioning (Cx) approach is a quality-focused process to achieve the Owner's Project Requirements, starting at project inception and continuing throughout the life of the facility. Commissioning is not an additional 2 Level 1 audits use platforms like the ASHRAE Building Energy Quotient Portal, EPA Energy Star Portfolio Manager, or Department of Energy Asset Scoring Tool to determine the benchmark score of each building and triage the performance of that building against peer building indices to determine if each building is a candidate for energy efficiency projects or is performing \"as it should be.\" 3 Energy-using systems such as HVAC, lighting, building automation (BAS), laboratory ventilation or heating hot water. 4 In compliance with the current version of ANSI/ACCA/ASHRAE Standard 211. 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 17 of 23 | 9.0 D&A layer of construction or project management, but rather a strategy to reduce the cost of delivering construction projects and increase value to owners, occupants, and users. It focuses on the integration and interdependency of facility systems, since a performance deficiency in one system can result in less-than-optimal performance by other systems. Upon completion, commissioning is intended to reduce the life-cycle cost of the facility as well as the project capital cost through the warranty period.5 Per University Policy 3-111.1, Energy Sustainability, all projects conducted at UCF that impact utility use or the indoor environment shall be commissioned. Retro-commissioning Process of Existing Building Automation System The Retro-commissioning (RCx) approach allows for a repeatable, standardized approach to optimizing building system performance. 6 RCx involves verification that the Building Automation System (BAS) is functioning as designed, such as checking if sensors are calibrated and actuators/relays are verified. Devices that are not performing properly are recalibrated, repaired, or replaced, and trend logs and system alarm notifications are updated accordingly. A re-Testing, Adjusting and Balancing (reTAB) is then conducted to restore proper airflow and water flow characteristics to the HVAC and/or laboratory ventilation systems. Once fully functional, the system's sequence of operations is tested and optimized to confirm that the programming is functioning as intended, and opportunities for optimization are recorded. Software changes are then developed and simulated, and the optimized sequence of operations is downloaded into the BAS controllers and re-verified. The BAS points are mapped into the UCF Fault Detection and Diagnostics monitoring-based commissioning platform. This system monitors system performance, and if it receives any data that indicates performance degradation or event occurrences that are outside of pre-defined tolerances, UES is notified for investigation. Lighting Technology Upgrades Lighting upgrade projects play a large part in energy conservation strategies at UCF. The University will continue to evaluate building and site lighting systems for the possibility of upgrading to more efficient fixtures with uniform lighting levels, color (temperature), and Color Rendering Index (CRI). At the time of this plan's development, LED technology is state-of-the-art and thus is the basis of technology reviewed and approved for upgrade and modernization projects. 5 Definitions derived from ASHRAE Commissioning Standards and Guidelines, Standard 202. 6 ASHRAE Commissioning Standards and Guidelines, Standard 202 and Guideline 0.2 are utilized for the overall retro-commissioning (RCx) process. 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 18 of 23 | 9.0 D&A In even further commitment to environmental stewardship, UCF has committed to complying with the International Dark Sky Association certification for exterior lighting fixtures. Green Building Standards Since 2007, UCF has pursued Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for all new construction, major renovations, and most recently, for existing buildings adhering to the latest LEED rating system. High-performance buildings play an integral part in supporting UCF's learning environment. Through LEED's high-efficiency standards, UCF LEED buildings are consuming approximately 30% less energy (based on ASHRAE 90.1 2010) and 40% less water than similar non-LEED buildings. Figure 9.0-3 LEED Impact on Main Campus Building Use Alternative Fuel Vehicles Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs), as defined by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), include any dedicated, flexible-fuel, or dual- fuel vehicle designed to operate on at least one alternative fuel. Alternative fuel vehicles come in a variety of vehicle models, such as sedans, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles, vans, shuttle buses, medium-duty vehicles (such as del ivery trucks), heavy-duty buses, and heavy-duty trucks. As vehicles are purchased, the University is required to purchase new vehicles fleet, at least 75% being AFV. When replacing existing fleet vehicles or adding to the fleet, the University shall seek out alternativ e fuel, flex fuel or hybrid-fueled vehicles. 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 19 of 23 | 9.0 D&A Distributed Generation - Photovoltaic (PV) Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems are anticipated to become a larger source of electrical energy at UCF campuses between 2020 and 2030. The rollout of PV installations will be based on energy generation potential, structural engineering reviews, and digital grid lab simulation. Floating Photovoltaic (FPV) systems represent an emerging market for PV systems sited directly on bodies of water. Possible benefits of FPV include efficiency gains due to lower cell temperatures; reduced balance of system costs associated with land costs and control of vegetation; improved water quality; reduced evaporation rates; and avoidance of land-energy conflicts. The Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) was awarded a contract by the U.S. Department of Energy to assess the performance of FPV systems relative to their land- based counterparts. This work will provide UCF with the data necessary to determine the incremental benefits of FPV on campus water bodies, preserving land for conservation or future development. E. Microgrids Energy Storage and Smart Grid Projects UCF is well-positioned to become one of the most electrically- efficient, reliable, and resilient institutions in the country, while also bringing significant economic benefit and reduction of carbon emissions. Most importantly, these improvements can be interactively integrated with the teaching and research mission of the University, resulting in a world- class showcase of advanced energy technology. This opportunity presents at a time when several developments have converged to offer all institutions improvements in various energy system attributes, including an unsubsidized cost of energy from PV systems that is competitive with traditional fossil-fueled generation; reduced electric energy storage costs in batteries; and dramatic improvements in the efficiency of major electric loads. The campus grid is effectively that of a small city, with a large number of commuting workers, full-time residents, and significant electric and critical loads. There are many benefits of operating as a microgrid. Facility characteristics: UCF currently operates a 5.5MWe Combined Heat and Power plant (CHP) powered by natural gas in baseload mode while using the waste heat to power an absorption chiller. The campus is served at primary voltage through six 12.47kV feeders from two different substations. 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 20 of 23 | 9.0 D&A The campus was developed on a \"greenfield\" basis, without having to accommodate any existing structures, streets, or underground utilities. While significant vacant land remains for future growth, the campus has been developed in a very space-efficient way, utilizing a concentric configuration for the highest possible structural density without feeling crowded. This translates to lower energy losses in distribution of electric and thermal energy. Due to the looped design of the campus 12.47kV feeders, all major buildings have at least one alternate feed which is currently available through manual switching, but could easily be converted to automated reconfiguration. Vacant, uncommitted, and unreserved land is still available on campus for 14-18MW of PV arrays and associated battery storage. Many buildings have advanced ener gy automation controls, with a campus-wide retrofit now underway. Continuous advancement and deployment of electric vehicles will present a vehicle-to-grid energy storage element, warranting further studies and modeling to determine how those rolling batteries could additionally serve the needs of a UCF microgrid. Staffing characteristics: A commitment by Facilities to self-perform work, with the use of consultants and contractors reserved for peak personnel demands or specialty needs. A strong link between Facilities staff and engineering faculty, including joint participation in externally-funded R&D projects and integration of senior design projects which benefit and improve campus energy systems. A commitment by the Office of Research and the College of Engineering to grow the academic programs in energy both generally, and specifically in smart grid, renewable energy, electric transportation, and cyber-physical security. User/occupant characteristics: A strong and nearly-universal commitment to sustainability. A highly-educated group with nearly-universal familiarity with technology and interconnected devices and systems. A permanent population (faculty and staff) which is under direction of the President and Board of Trustees, and a transient population (students) which is effectively constrained by the application process, code of conduct, and peer expectations. Beyond Planning for Load Growth - The Traditional Microgrid UCF has always planned well for the growing electrical demands of its building program, and certainly provided reliability within the requirements of all codes and user expectations. In the short term, however, the combination of economic forces and our greater reliance on electric energy has given rise to the use of microgrids that operate in parallel with the electric utility, but contain embedded distributed generation units to be capable of separating all or part of the loads in times of stress or for economic advantage. This is a conventional reactionary microgrid, which is likely to be justified for 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 21 of 23 | 9.0 D&A UCF in the immediate future. Analysis by UES and studies by the College of Engineering would provide the basis for recommendations to the Administration. Beyond Reaction - The Advanced Microgrid For modest capital expense, UCF is well-positioned to expand its control of the microgrid so that it can anticipate changes in circuit parameters, economic conditions, and external electrical disturbances. Because implementation is largely accomplished by digital means, through monitoring, communications, and control, the only significant capital expense is the incremental cost of high-speed switches over the slower, motor-operated switchgear in today's designs. Features of the advanced microgrid include distributed cooperative control, high-speed fault detection with parallel reconfiguration, anticipatory microgrid reconfiguration for economics and/or resiliency, complete or partial islanding from the utility provider, flexible market transactions, management of storage, and system inertia support from inverter-coupled storage. A powerful feature of an advanced microgrid structure is that economic preferences and operating requirements, yet to be defined, can be seamlessly introduced in the future. Of critical importance is the requirement that the system provides overall cyber physical security, yet allows for highly interactive features, including both central-market and peer-to-peer transactions, constrained global optimization of the energy resources and distributed cooperative control for area optimization of real and reactive power output. UCF can achieve this grid security using location-based communication protocols, distributed state estimation, and resilient control algorithms. UCF is well prepared to face the unique challenge of advanced R&D coupled with practical application in both daily operations and retrofit scenarios. There will be several areas of theoretical development required. Industrial process optimization for such a wide range of parameters is particularly challenging, and the requirement for uniform functionality of both retrofit and future installations demands a very structured approach. While the relationships of these functions require significant explanation, a summary of the highlights of innovation includes: Development and integration of Local and Wide-Area control of real power for enhanced grid stability; especially important for distributed generation coupled through high reactance. Development and integration of Local and Wide-Area control of reactive power for improved voltage profiles and power factor; to be implanted by smart inverters. Development and integration of Distributed Cooperative Control options; especially important as more DG resources are dispersed on campus. Structured economic optimization of both real and reactive output Preferences, accommodating future possibilities of tariffed service rates, central market, bilateral and pee r-to-peer 9.0 CONSERVATION DATA & ANALYSIS 22 of 23 | 9.0 D&A transactions; especially important as the business models of utilities face rapid change. Development of a Parametric Analysis output mode, allowing interrogation of system responses to prospective changes in equipment investment or operating practices; especially important for evaluation and optimization of upgrades, storage, etc. Development of an Anticipation Mode, wherein knowledge of an upcoming outage risk (such as an approaching thunderstorm) or an upcoming demand shift (such as a football game) is automatically transform ed to a system configuration response, like pre-loading emergency generation for critical labs or economic changes in demand management profiles. Development of a Resiliency Mode (aka \"Storm Mode\") utilizing the inherent distributed cooperative control features to permit partial restoration of a small-area or regional \"island\" after destruction of transmission or distribution from a natural disaster. Development of cyber physical security integrating physical limits of the campus grid and using location-based communication protocols, distributed state estimation, and resilient control algorithms; especially important as DER becomes a dominant generation resource and communications remains web-connected. 23 of 23 | 9.0 MAPS 9.0 CONSERVATION MAPS9.0 CONSERVATION Figure 9.0-4 Figure 9.0-4 Conservation Lands Map 9.0 CONSERVATION Figure 9.0-5 Figure 9.0-5 Map of Threatened and Endangered Plants and Animals 9.0 CONSERVATION Figure 9.0-6 Figure 9.0-6 Map of Gopher Tortoise Burrows in Surveyed Units 10.0 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS & IMPLEMENTATION 10.0 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS & IMPLEMENTATION 202030 CAMPUS MASTER PLAN UPDATE CONTENTS INTRODUCTION .................................................................................................................. .... 1 10.1 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ............................................................................................ 2 Goals, Objectives, & Policies .............................................................................................. 2 10.2 IMPLEMENTATION ......................................................................................................... 3 Goals, Objectives, & Policies ............................................................................................... 3 10.1 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ............................................................................................ 7 Data & Analysis ............................................................................................................... .... 7 10.2 IMPLEMENTATION ......................................................................................................... 9 Data & Analysis ............................................................................................................... .... 9 MAPS & TABLES ................................................................................................................. .. 18 10.0 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS & IMPLEMENTATION INTRODUCTION 1 of 18 | 10.0 INTRO INTRODUCTION NARRATIVE For the 2020-30 Campus Master Plan Update, the University of Central Florida has elected to combine the required CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS element with a new optional element, IMPLEMENTATION.

Public Education Capital Outlay (PECO) The University receives funding from the State for capital improvements in various appropriation types. The primary funding source is Public Education Capital Outlay (PECO). These funds are appropriated to the State University System (SUS) pursuant to Section 1013.64(4), Florida Statutes, which provides that a list of projects is submitted to the Commissioner of Education for inclusion in the Fixed Capital Outlay Budget Request. A lump sum appropriation (sum of digits) may be provided for remodeling, renovation, maintenance, repair, and site improvements for existing satisfactory facilities. The projects funded from PECO are normally for institutional, academic support, or institutional support purposes. Capital Improvement Trust Fund (CITF) UCF students pay Building Fees and C apital Improvement Fees as part of their tuition. This revenue source is used to finance student-related facilities, such as student unions, libraries, outdoor recreation, and athletic facilities; or debt services issued by t he State University System. Projects funded by CITF are selected and prioritized by the CITF Committee. Private Donations and Grants Private donations and grants are another source of revenue authorized by Florida Statute. Legislative approval is not required for the use of these funds. Revenues and Bonds Auxiliary Organizations, such as Housing and Residence Life, Business Services, and Parking and Transportation Services, and Direct Service Organizations such as UCF Athletics use revenues collected from their operations to fund capital improvements. Auxiliaries may also bond capital improvements and pledge auxiliary revenues for debt service. Either method requires BOT approval. Courtelis Funds The state's matching program, the Alec P. Courtelis Facilities Challenge Grant Program, is currently suspended.3 Statutory Documents Overview The following is a description of planning documents submitted to the BOG or the State to inventory and assess capital improvements. 10-year Schedule of Capital Projects (SCP) The 10-Year Schedule of Capital Projects (SCP) is based on needs identified throughout the Campus Master Plan.

Main Campus Academic facilities added since 2015. Since the adoption of the 2015 -25 Campus Master Plan Update, UCF has added significant new space on the Main Campus , including the following: UCF Global UCF Global is a 54,887 GSF building, which opened in 2016 to serve as the International Hub on campu s. It serves international students, faculty, and staff , as well as others engaging in high -impact international experiences. John C Hitt Library expansion The expansion of the existing library is being completed in phases. Library Phase 1 constructed a 18,509 GSF Automated Retrieval Center (ARC) which is a high -density facilit y capable of storing 750,000 volumes of library material with robotic retrieval; as well as shell space for a 4 th-floor reading room. Library Phase 1A added a 40,000 GSF, 4 -story connector building between the existing library and the ARC. The connector includes study and library operations areas, and build out of the ARC 4 th floor shell space into a reading room. Future phases will renovate the existi ng 5-story library to improve study areas and library operations, and provide another 500,000 volumes of library material storage capacity. Research I Research I, occupied in 2018, is a 105,775 GSF building providing nearly 80 laboratories (primarily wet labs), offices, and conference, break, and support rooms. Trevor Colbourn Hall (TCH) Trevor Colbourn Hall is a 136,786 GSF facility with classrooms, meeting rooms, study space, and offices for the College of Arts & Humanities, Burnett Honors College, the College of Undergraduate Studies, the College of Graduate Studies, Student Development and Enrollment Services, and UCF IT. When the building opened in 2018, it had over 10,000 NASF of finished, unoccupied space to support University growth. When TCH wa s completed, Colbourn Hall was demolished after 45 years in service. CREOL Expansion This 13,500 GSF addition to the 1996 CREOL Building added necessary space for the College of Optics and Photonics. 11.0 ACADEMIC & SUPPORT FACILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 6 of 11 | 11.0 D&A SPACE DEFICIT Despite efforts to fund and construct new facilities, UCF has deficits in every space category. Table 11.0 -2 Unmet Space Needs The following table was taken from the current UCF Educational Plant Survey , page 3 6, \"Table 7 Formula Generated Net Assignable Square Feet by Category .\" CLASSROOM S Classroom space deficits may be alleviated by adding classrooms and through policy changes that improve classroom utilization through scheduling. Without strong measures, UCF will run out of schedulable classroom space in fewer than 6 years . Classroom Utilization (Efficiency) The University's Main Campus is operating well above capacity for classroom utilization, because of the routine usage of regular academic space throughout a weekly schedule that is greater than what the official SUS space formula calls for (i.e., 67 hours per week, versus the of ficial 40 hours per week). In addition, Courses are taught in areas originally designed for other purposes (laboratories, conference rooms, theaters, study areas, etc.). 11.0 ACADEMIC & SUPPORT FACILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 7 of 11 | 11.0 D&A Figure 11.0 -4 is a breakdown by days and hours for the general - purpose classrooms. There are 155 rooms in use for a total of 5,984 hours, making the average 38.6 hours per room. Figure 11.0 -3 Lecture Rooms in Use by Day and Time shows the strong pattern of prime -time classroom use Monday through Thursday. Figure 11.0 -3 Average Weekly Hours by Rooms and Time of Day Figure 11.0 -4 Lecture Rooms in Use by Day and Time Adding / Removing Classrooms In the past 5 years, UCF has added classrooms as follows: In 2016, UCF Global added 18 departmental classrooms and several conference rooms to support international programs. In 2018, Trevor Colbourn Hall added six general -purpose active learning classrooms and two departmental classrooms. 11.0 ACADEMIC & SUPPORT FACILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 8 of 11 | 11.0 D&A In 2018, Colbourn Hall was demolished, removing four (4) classrooms. In 2018, the College of Business Administration renovated a general -purpose lecture hall into a large active learning classroom, and renovated two departmental classrooms and contiguous space into another large active learning classroom. In 2019, UCF Downtown opened 26 general -purpose active learning classrooms in the Dr. Phillips Academic Commons and four (4) classrooms in UnionWest; and added teaching labs and classrooms for Valencia Colleg e in both buildings. The courses moved to the downtown classrooms will help relieve overcrowding on the Main Campus. Improving Existing Classroom Utilization The Office of the Registrar is working diligently on a policy to improve utilization by improving scheduling policies. Policies that would improve utilization include: Requiring faculty to teach during the normal class hours of 7:00am to 6:00pm Monday through Friday, rather than only during the prime -time hours (9:00am to 4:30pm, 30 hours per week). Requiring \"O n Grid\" scheduling, whereby course schedules must adhere to: 50-minute blocks on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 75-minute blocks on Tuesday and Thursday Identify ing departmental class rooms that could be transferred to the general -purpose classroom inventory . Teaching Everywhere There are many types of learning spaces that support scheduled instruction, including open labs , conference rooms, and meeting rooms. Without the use of these additional spaces, UCF's classroom space deficit would be even more severe . Learning spaces may be scheduled for use if: the activities generate weekly student contact hours (WSCH), the activities fulfill course requirements, and/or there is a formal convener present. TEACHING LABS The Weekly Student Contact Hours (WSCH) for teaching labs are lower than the WSCH for classrooms , but square footage per student is typically greater in teaching labs, at approximately 30-35 SF per station. While growth in STEM disciplines leads to a need for more teaching labs, the need does not rise as steeply as the need for classrooms. Teaching Lab utilization always appears to lack \"efficiency\" compared to classrooms. The room use standard is 24 hours for lower level courses and 20 hours for upper level. The station occupancy rate is 80% for both levels. 11.0 ACADEMIC & SUPPORT FACILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 9 of 11 | 11.0 D&A In certain disciplines, the need for labs is particularly acute and is the bottleneck for not offering more sections , example s: Organic Chemistry, Chemistry, and Physics. RESEARCH LABS The need for added research laboratories is driven by the need for space for research faculty, research clusters, and student staff to support research projects. With research success comes the need for added faculty ; and in the lab sciences, engineering, studio arts, etc., new faculty need lab sp ace to support scholarship and required professional development activities. Research labs are needed for thesis and dissertation work in disciplines with active graduate programs, such as science and engineering. The distinction between research labs and teaching labs blurs somewhat , as instructional functions are intrinsic to both. Often the same lab is used for faculty research, graduate coursework, and thesis or dissertation work. Increasing the campus research space portfolio continues to be a high priority, due to UCF's current unmet research space need, its growing research program s, and its goal for preeminence. OFFICE /COMPUTER While offices are not considered academic spaces, improving our student to faculty ratio requires additional regular faculty and staff, who cannot function properly without office space. Therefore, as classrooms and teaching labs are added, offices for instructional faculty will be needed. The University has made a strong effort to maximize office space efficiency by designing right -sized offices and encouraging open office environments ba sed on functional need. Additional study areas created in the past five years include: Trevor Colbourn Hall (2018), which includes considerable public space dedicated to study areas. Business Administration renovations increased the quantity and effectiveness of public area study space. Additional study space is found scattered in buildings across the campus. Approximately 32% of study areas are outside the Library, and forward -thinki ng design philosophies will result in an even higher percentage in the future . UNMET SPACE NEEDS The University's unmet space need, as determined by the current Educational Plant Survey, is 2,258,813 square feet . It is likely that the University will still be operating with a significant space deficit during the planning timeframe. While the future of state -funding for new construction cannot be predicted, UCF will continue operating with high efficiency, and exploring methods to further improve its space utilization. 11.0 ACADEMIC & SUPPORT FACILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 10 of 11 | 11.0 D&A Interdisciplinary Buildings Many UCF buildings include multiple space categories such as learning space, office, study, and support space within a single structure. It is likely that future academic facilities will be interdisciplinary in nature, rather than single -use buildings ( e.g., classroom building, laboratory building) . DATA & ANALYSIS 11.2 Support Facilities Sub-Element Inventory and Analysis of Existing Conditions The purpose of the Support Facilities Sub-Element is to ensure that the University is providing sufficient support facilities to satisfy its needs. Support Building Space Support building spaces include adm inistrative offices; campus administrative spaces, such as facilities management buildings; student support services; auxiliary facilities, intercollegiate, intramural, and recreational athletic facilities ; and facilities of a non -academic nature such as t he Student Union and auditoria/exhibition spaces. To properly support campus needs, support facilities must be provided in parallel to the demands created by academic facilities. The space required for support facilities is related to the University's space deficit and the type of facilities to be constructed. Support space needs are estimated every five (5) years through the development of the Educational Plant Survey (EPS) . Main Campus Support facilities added since 2015. During the first 5 -years since the 2015 -25 CMP was published, the following support facilities were added or enlarged: Warehouse Support Building (Bldg. 16 -F) District Energy Plant IV (Bldg. 143) Facilities Support Building (Bldg. 162, behind Bldg. 22) Garage C Expansion (Bldg. 83 ) Lab & Environmental Support (Expansion of Bldg. 48) Arboretum Greenhouse ( Bldg. 161) Band Practice Facility ( Bldg. 163) Wayne Densch Center for Student -Athlete Leadership ( Bldg. 136) Temporary Football Game -Day Parking Garvy Center for Student -Athlete Nu trition (part of Bldg. 135) Pollo Tropical Restaurant (Bldg. 183) Roth Athletics Center (Bldg. 165) - under construction Future Support Facilities The following support facilities are planned Recycling Facility Environmental Health and Safety Support Facility 11.0 ACADEMIC & SUPPORT FACILITIES DATA & ANALYSIS 11 of 11 | 11.0 D&A Other In 2016, t he Board of Trustees sublet 5.24 acres of campus to Pegasus Hotel, LLC to build the Celeste Hotel, north of University Boulevard on Alafaya Trail. This facility does not belong to UCF ; but UCF will benefit by proximity to the hotel Conference Center. 12.0 FACILITIES MAINTENANCE 12.0 FACILITIES MAINTENANCE 2020 -30 CAMPUS MASTER PLAN UPDATE CONTENTS INTRODUCTION ................................ ................................ ................................ ........................ 1 GOALS, OBJECTIVES, & & ANALYSIS ................................ ................................ 12.0 FACILITIES MAINTENANCE INTRODUCTION 1 | 12.0 INTRO INTRODUCTION NARRATIVE Facilities Operations , a department in Facilities and Safety (F&S) , maintains the University's facilities in order to support the academic mission of the University. The operations and maintenance of campus facilities has a heavy impact on campus sustainability. The fixtures in the restrooms determine the amount of water that is consumed by the buildings. The efficiency of the eq uipment and lighting determines the amount of energy that is consumed by the buildings. Finally , the timely maintenance performed on the equipment largely determines a building's environmental impact . By establishing proactive routine, preventive, and planned facility maintenance programs, Facilities Operations (FO) will extend the useful life of all buildings and prevent premature capital outlay for their replacement s. Facilities Operations Mission The Facilities Operations Mission is to support the University's collective impact through ensuring campus operations run smoothly while exceeding student, faculty, and staff service expectations. This is accomplished by providing cost -effective and reliable operations and maintenance to minimize interruptio ns and create a safe, comfortable , and clean campus for all , to facilitate and sustain an enhanced collaborative and successful research -based learning environment into the future for our students to grow, learn, and succeed.

Regularly -scheduled preventive maintenance not only prevents sudden and unexpected equipment failure, but also reduces the overall life -cycle cost of the building. Building Condition Assessments Since 2012, the University has contracted with the ISES Corporation to benchmark and detail the condition of its E&G facilities . On a triennial basis, Facilities Condition Assessments are performed on each E&G building . Categories inspected include exterior structure and roof system, interior structure , ADA accessibility, energy/water conservation, health, fire/life safety, HVAC, electrical, plumbing , and elevators. This ongoing assessment helps the University prioritize and perform the most critical repairs in a cost -effective manner, therefore helping to avoid the accumu lation of deferred maintenance on campus. These reports have become an invaluable tool when renovating existing buildings . Capital Planning and Deferred Maintenance Management System Additionally, the University has implemented a Capital Planning and Defe rred Maintenance management system. As an add -on to the current Enterprise Asset Management system, this module will function seamlessly with the work order system , enhancing the facilities condition assessment data into a \"living database\" of actual asse t condition s. Prioritizing Building Issues Issues regarding SREF1, life safety codes, ADA compliance, hazardous materials (including asbestos, lead -based paints and other environmental or hazardous materials), roof management, and energy efficiency are prioritized and addressed as funding becomes available. NEW CONSTRU CTION PLANNING All University buildings must have proven engineering designs in accordance with the UCF Design, Construction, and Renovation Standards , so that they can be integrated into the existing campus maintenance programs. OPERATIONS AND WORK FLOW Since 2015, FO has added over 60 standard operating procedures (SOPs) to refine workflow process es and facilitate high service levels , performance standards, and repeated quality. Zone -based Maintenance FO adopted a zone -based maintenance approach in 2013, and has been refining its operations ever since. In addition to the day -shift building maintenance, FO subsequently created night -shift preventive maintenance and inspection teams . These teams have achieved over 1 State Requirements for Educational Facilities ( SREF ) 12.0 FACILITIES MAINTENANCE DATA & ANALYSIS 6 | 12.0 D&A 99% compliance with planned life sa fety inspections and the routine preventive maintenance program. This hybrid approach allows day- shift maintenance teams to focus on routine maintenance, while night - shift teams focus on critical life safety or environmental control systems , ensuring th at proactive inspections and maintenance do not disrupt the student experience. Maintenance Management System AiM2 is a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) that is used for work and asset management . Housekeeping NARRATIVE A functional building. An attractive campus. A clean environment. Our mission is to create a safe, functional, clean, efficient, and attractive living and learning environment.
