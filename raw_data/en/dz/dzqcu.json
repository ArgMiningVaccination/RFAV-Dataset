Vaccine Injury Table [The Vaccine Injury Table](/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vaccine-injury-table-01-03-2022.pdf) (PDF - 339 KB) lists injuries and/or conditions associated with some covered vaccines. If the first symptom of these injuries and/or conditions occurs within the specified time periods and the injury meets the definition included in the Table, it is presumed that the vaccine caused the injury or condition unless another cause is proven. This applies even if a covered vaccine is administered \"off-label\" or contrary to CDC or Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommendations. If your injury and/or condition is not on the Table, or if your injury and/or condition does not meet the Table requirements, you must prove through evidence such as expert witness testimony, medical records, or medical opinion that the vaccine caused the injury and/or condition.

Some non-seasonal influenza vaccines, however, are covered by the [Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP)](http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/). If you receive both the seasonal flu vaccine and certain non-seasonal influenza vaccine and suffer a serious injury, you can file a claim with either the VICP or the CICP or with both programs. Your eligibility to receive compensation from either or both programs depends on the specifics of your claim. Seasonal Flu Vaccine and Children Children and adults who receive a seasonal influenza vaccine and are thought to be injured may file a petition with the VICP even if the vaccine administered is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exclusively for adults.
