No single option will work for everyone - that is why we value one-on-one care to find the best plan for you. Bioidentical hormone pellet therapy, usually simply called pellet therapy, is the most natural way to replenish hormone levels for women and men. Implants placed under the skin consistently release small doses of bioidentical hormones like those found normally in your body. This method is simple, convenient and has one of the best safety records. Although we offer many bioidentical hormone replacement options, we believe pellets are often the best hormone replacement therapy. When hormones are absorbed rather than swallowed, they go directly to the tissues and are not altered by the liver. Advantages - Hormones are absorbed directly into bloodstream, avoiding liver and gastrointestinal system. - Hormones are continuously available. - Your body controls release of hormones: You absorb more during exercise and stress and less when at rest. - Pellets typically last 3-5 months, providing convenience. - You avoid daily application of creams or gels. - Studies show this method to be best for mental clarity and sexual function. - Pellets are beneficial for bone density. The pharmacies we use to compound pellets for our patients follow the strictest guidelines for safety and quality. History of Pellet Therapy Pellets for hormone replacement have been around since the late 1930s. However, their popularity declined starting in the 1950s with the growth of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and the availability of the synthetic, oral hormone called Premarin. Premarin is derived from the urine of pregnant horses, which contains large quantities of estrogen-like chemicals. Premarin and the progestin (Provera) were the two hormones utilized in the [Women's Health Initiative](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/womens-health-initiative-whi) study that linked certain forms of hormone replacement with an increased risk of blood clots, stroke and breast cancer. Fortunately, pellet therapy never went away, and it is now recognized as a thorough way to manage symptoms related to hormone deficiency. "}
