With so many reasons to want to incorporate a healing crystal in your life and so very many stones available, you may want to know just how to choose the right one for you. We use crystals in our daily lives for healing purposes, as they aid and guide us on our healing and spiritual journeys. From Rose Quartz to Amethyst and so many more, we can help you navigate the amazing experience of choosing a healing crystal for you. In order to know how to choose the right [healing crystal](https://www.healingcrystals.com/Healing-Crystals) for you, it helps to understand what healing crystals are. Crystals, gems, minerals, rocks... they all contain vibrational energy. This energy moves through and emanates from each crystal at varying rates depending on the type of healing crystal you choose. Through the vibrations emitted and transmuted by the crystal, our bodies will respond accordingly to the different energy and properties held by that crystal. The effects are positive and beneficial, as each stone's energy utilizes itself in different ways for healing, such as generating energy or holding it within the stone by absorption. Energy from healing crystals can radiate out or be amplified by many other factors. When it comes to how to choose the right healing crystal for you, it is good to remember that crystals help to remind us of our connection to the earth and all of its healing vibrations. Belief and intention reinforces the energy of the crystal, and when it comes to crystal healing the intention we set and desire for ourselves is crucial. For instance, since our thoughts are energy, if you think and believe a stone will help support your intention, that same vibration is transmitted and picked up by the stone. This sets in motion the desired physical or spiritual healing. Healing crystals keep us anchored to the earth, always presenting themselves with elements of life and universal healing properties. They serve as great guides and aides, supporting us in our healing journey. As [different crystals](https://www.healingcrystals.com/Crystals-and-Minerals) have diverse healing properties, various ailments can be focused upon by intentionally choosing the stones with which to work. Known for eliminating negative energy from our mind and body fields, healing crystals allow for positive vibrations to connect with us as we embark on our journey of well-being. Some crystals are known for protection and shielding, while others are known for love, balance and harmony. There are stones for abundance, clarity and prosperity, just as there are stones to aid with health conditions. Healing crystals possess many amazing qualities and properties that can help us connect to a higher, healing source as well as guide us in our spiritual endeavors. By knowing that we can use crystals for healing, we can further understand how to choose the right healing crystal for our needs. While you may wonder how to choose the right healing crystal for you, the question of \"why\" may also cross your mind: why use healing crystals and minerals, and do I really need a healing crystal? If you have even been considering choosing a crystal for you, then you probably need one! People use healing crystals for a wide range of reasons and varying intentions. They include: Many health issues have people turning to holistic aids for their ailments. Pain from illness, side effects from illness and medications, recurring health issues such as headaches and gastrointestinal issues and insomnia are all valid reasons for people seeking to choose the right healing crystal to guide them on their healing journey. People experiencing grief, sadness, anger or stress may choose the right healing crystal for their needs to help work through and alleviate these emotions. Jealousy, creative blocks, lack of passion and apathy are some other emotional reasons people may want to work with crystals. There are times when we would like to feel more connected to our Source spiritually - to the Universe, to God, to Mother Earth and Higher Sources. Sometimes we need some guidance and help exploring and strengthening that connection. Healing crystals serve as a great way to start that spiritual journey to finding ourselves, our spiritual connection and deepening that aspect of our lives. If you are wondering how to choose the right healing crystal for you, and spiritual connection is what you are seeking, then this is a great starting point on your path. Healing crystals complement meditation very well and help guide us into deeper states of altered consciousness. Different stones can promote varying frequencies and vibrations to help achieve your meditative intentions. When our energetic fields are not aligned, and the energy is over or under active due to physical, mental or emotional illness, our [Chakras](https://www.healingcrystals.com/Chakra_Information_Articles_11687.html) reflect this imbalance. We balance our Chakras to connect and reinforce our overall well-being, including our spiritual health. When our energy is in alignment then our whole system functions on a better level and we are in a higher state of harmony with balanced Chakras. [Many crystals aid us with our Chakras](https://www.healingcrystals.com/crystals-by-primary-chakra-stones-property-2-tags.html), with different stones corresponding to each of our seven main energy centers. When choosing the right healing crystal for you, if balancing Chakras is your intention then you will need a crystal that can work with the energy of whichever Chakra may need balancing. Sometimes we simply enjoy healing crystals and feel good when they are in our living spaces, worn on our bodies or carried with us. Not having a reason other than appreciating the beauty and awe of healing crystals is a good enough reason to choose the right healing crystal to have in your space. If you like crystals, then why not choose one to cherish in your life? Once you figure out the reason you would like a crystal, then you can narrow down the crystals that are good for each situation. And if you still don't know the reason why you would like a healing crystal, that is perfectly okay, because there is a crystal for that, too! Intuition - your own intuition and inner voice - will be your best guide when it comes to choosing the right healing crystal for you. You may find that you are drawn to a specific crystal, as our subconscious or our Higher Self often knows what it is that we most need and serves our best interest. Look at the crystals, feel and hold the crystals - notice any sensations you may experience when you are near or holding each one. Take a quiet moment while holding each crystal in your hands, close your eyes and focus on what kind of vibration you may feel. The crystal that most resonates with you is the right healing crystal for you. Questions to ponder upon: Are you in need of spiritual connection? Have you been struggling emotionally?
