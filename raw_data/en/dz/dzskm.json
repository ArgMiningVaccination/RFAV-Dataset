Bond and transfer of wells. 1.Bond requirements. Prior to commencing drilling operations, any person who proposes to drill a well for oil, gas, or injection, or source well for use in enhanced recovery operations, shall submit to the commission, and obtain its approval, a surety bond or cash bond. An alternative form of security may be approved by the commission after notice and hearing, as provided by law. The operator of such well shall be the principal on the bond covering the well. Each surety bond shall be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. 2.Bond amounts and limitations. The bond shall be in the amount of fifty thousand dollars when applicable to one well only. Wells drilled to a total depth of less than two thousand feet [609.6 meters] may be bonded in a lesser amount if approved by the director. When the principal on the bond is drilling or operating a number of wells within the state or proposes to do so, the principal may submit a bond conditioned as provided by law. Wells utilized for commercial disposalinjection operations must be bonded in the amount of fifty thousand dollars. A blanket bond covering more than one well shall be in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, provided the bond shall be limited to no more than six of the following in aggregate: a.A well that is a dry hole and is not properly plugged; b.A well that is plugged and the site is not properly reclaimed; and c.A well that is abandoned pursuant to subsection 1 of North Dakota Century Code section 38-08-04 or section 43-02-03-55 and is not properly plugged and the site is not properly reclaimed. If this aggregate of wells is reached, all well permits, for which drilling has not commenced, held by the principal of such bond are suspended. No rights may be exercised under the permits until the aggregate of wells drops below the required limit, or the operator files the appropriate bond to cover the permits, at which time the rights given by the drilling permits are reinstated. A well with an approved temporary abandoned status shall have the same status as an oil, gas, or injection well. The commission may, after notice and hearing, require higher bond amounts than those referred to in this section. Such additional amounts for bonds must be related to the economic value of the well or wells and the expected cost of plugging and well site reclamation, as determined by the commission. The commission may refuse to accept a bond or to add wells to a blanket bond if the operator or surety company has failed in the past to comply with statutes, rules, or orders relating to the operation of wells; if a civil or administrative action brought by the commission is pending against the operator or surety company; or for other good cause. 3.Unit bond requirements. Prior to commencing unit operations, the operator of any area under unitized management shall submit to the commission, and obtain its approval, a surety bond or cash bond. An alternative form of security may be approved by the commission after notice and hearing, as provided by law. The operator of the unit shall be the principal on the bond covering the unit. The amount of the bond shall be specified by the commission in the order approving the plan of unitization. Each surety bond shall be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. Prior to transfer of a unit to a new operator, the commission, after notice and hearing, may revise the bond amount for a unit, or in the case when the unit was not previously bonded, the commission may require a bond and set a bond amount for the unit. 4.Bond terms. Bonds shall be conditioned upon full compliance with North Dakota Century Code chapter 38-08, and all administrative rules and orders of the commission. It shall be a 50plugging bond, as well as a drilling bond, and is to endure up to and including approved plugging of all oil, gas, and injection wells as well as dry holes. Approved plugging shall also include practical reclamation of the well site and appurtenances thereto. If the principal does not satisfy the bond's conditions, then the surety shall satisfy the conditions or forfeit to the commission the face value of the bond. 5.Transfer of wells under bond. Transfer of property does not release the bond. In case of transfer of property or other interest in the well and the principal desires to be released from the bond covering the well, such as producers, not ready for plugging, the principal must proceed as follows: a.The principal must notify the director, in writing, of all proposed transfers of wells at least thirty days before the closing date of the transfer. The director may, for good cause, waive this requirement. The principal shall submit to the commission a form 15 reciting that a certain well, or wells, describing each well by quarter -quarter, section, township, and range, is to be transferred to a certain transferee, naming such transferee, for the purpose of ownership or operation. The date of assignment or transfer must be stated and the form signed by a party duly authorized to sign on behalf of the principal. On said transfer form the transferee shall recite the following: \"The transferee has read the foregoing statement and does accept such transfer and does accept the responsibility of such well under the transferee's one -well bond or, as the case may be, does accept the responsibility of such wells under the transferee's blanket bond, said bond being tendered to or on file with the commission.\" Such acceptance must likewise be signed by a party authorized to sign on behalf of the transferee and the transferee's surety. b.When the commission has passed upon the transfer and acceptance and accepted it under the transferee's bond, the transferor shall be released from the responsibility of plugging the well and site reclamation. If such wells include all the wells within the responsibility of the transferor's bond, such bond will be released by the commission upon written request. Such request must be signed by an officer of the transferor or a person authorized to sign for the transferor. The director may refuse to transfer any well from a bond if the well is in violation of a statute, rule, or order. c.The transferee (new operator) of any oil, gas, or injection well shall be responsible for the plugging and site reclamation of any such well. For that purpose the transferee shall submit a new bond or, in the case of a surety bond, produce the written consent of the surety of the original or prior bond that the latter's responsibility shall continue and attach to such well. The original or prior bond shall not be released as to the plugging and reclamation responsibility of any such transferor until the transferee shall submit to the commission an acceptable bond to cover such well. All liability on bonds shall continue until the plugging and site reclamation of such wells is completed and approved. 6.Treating plant bond. Prior to the commencement of operations, any person proposing to operate a treating plant must submit to the commission and obtain its approval of a surety bond or cash bond. An alternative form of security may be approved by the commission after notice and hearing, as provided by law. The person responsible for the operation of the plant shall be the principal on the bond. Each surety bond shall be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. The amount of the bond must be as prescribed in section 43 -02-03-51.3. It is to remain in force until the operations cease, all equipment is removed from the site, and the site and appurtenances thereto are reclaimed, or liability of the bond is transferred to another bond that provides the same degree of security. If 51the principal does not satisfy the bond's conditions, then the surety shall satisfy the conditions or forfeit to the commission the face value of the bond. 7. Saltwater handling facility bond. Prior to the commencement of operations, any person proposing to operate a saltwater handling facility that is not already bonded as an appurtenance shall submit to the commission and obtain its approval of a surety bond or cash bond. An alternative form of security may be approved by the commission after notice and hearing, as provided by law. The person responsible for the operation of the saltwater handling facility must be the principal on the bond. Each surety bond must be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. The amount of the bond must be as prescribed in section 43 -02-03-53.3. It is to remain in force until the operations cease, all equipment is removed from the site, and the site and appurtenances thereto are reclaimed, or liability of the bond is transferred to another bond that provides the same degree of security. If the principal does not satisfy the bond's conditions, the surety shall satisfy the conditions or forfeit to the commission the face value of the bond. Transfer of property does not release the bond. The director may refuse to transfer any saltwater handling facility from a bond if the saltwater handling facility is in violation of a statute, rule, or order. 8. Crude oil and produced water underground gathering pipeline bond. The bonding requirements for crude oil and produced water underground gathering pipelines are not to be construed to be required on flow lines, injection pipelines, pipelines operated by an enhanced recovery unit for enhanced recovery unit operations, or on piping utilized to connect wells, tanks, treaters, flares, or other equipment on the production facility. a. Any owner of an underground gathering pipeline transferring crude oil or produced water, after April 19, 2015, shall submit to the commission and obtain its approval of a surety bond or cash bond prior to July 1, 2017. Any owner of a proposed underground gathering pipeline to transfer crude oil or produced water shall submit to the commission and obtain its approval of a surety bond or cash bond prior to placing into service. An alternative form of security may be approved by the commission after notice and hearing, as provided by law. The person responsible for the operation of the crude oil or produced water underground gathering pipeline must be the principal on the bond. Each surety bond must be executed by a responsible surety company authorized to transact business in North Dakota. The bond must be in the amount of fifty thousand dollars when applicable to one crude oil or produced water underground gathering pipeline system only. Such underground gathering pipelines that are less than one mile [1609.34 meters] in length may be bonded in a lesser amount if approved by the director. When the principal on the bond is operating multiple gathering pipeline systems within the state or proposes to do so, the principal may submit a blanket bond conditioned as provided by law. A blanket bond covering one or more underground gathering pipeline systems must be in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars. The owner shall file with the director, as prescribed by the director, a geographical information system layer utilizing North American datum 83 geographic coordinate system and in an environmental systems research institute shape file format showing the location of all associated above ground equipment and the pipeline centerline from the point of origin to the termination point of all underground gathering pipelines on the bond. Each layer must include at least the following information: (1) The name of the pipeline gathering system and other separately named portions thereof; (2) The type of fluid transported; (3) The pipeline composition; (4) Burial depth; and 52 (5) Approximate in-service date. b. The blanket bond covering more than one underground gathering pipeline system is limited to no more than six of the following instances of noncompliance in aggregate: (1) Any portion of an underground gathering pipeline system that has been removed from service for more than one year and is not properly abandoned pursuant to section 43-02-03-29.1; and (2) An underground gathering pipeline right-of-way, including associated above ground equipment, which has not been properly reclaimed pursuant to section 43-02-03-29.1. If this aggregate of underground gathering pipeline systems is reached, the commission may refuse to accept additional pipeline systems on the bond until the aggregate is brought back into compliance. The commission, after notice and hearing, may require higher bond amounts than those referred to in this section. Such additional amounts for bonds must be related to the economic value of the underground gathering pipeline system and the expected cost of pipeline abandonment and right-of-way reclamation, as determined by the commission. The commission may refuse to accept a bond or to add underground gathering pipeline systems to a blanket bond if the owner or surety company has failed in the past to comply with statutes, rules, or orders relating to the operation of underground gathering pipelines; if a civil or administrative action brought by the commission is pending against the owner or surety company; if an underground gathering pipeline system has exhibited multiple failures; or for other good cause. c. The underground gathering pipeline bond is to remain in force until the pipeline has been abandoned, as provided in section 43 -02-03-29.1, and the right-of-way, including all associated above ground equipment, has been reclaimed as provided in section 43-02-03-29.1, or liability of the bond is transferred to another bond that provides the same degree of security. If the principal does not satisfy the bond's conditions, the surety shall satisfy the conditions or forfeit to the commission the face value of the bond. d. Transfer of underground gathering pipelines under bond. Transfer of property does not release the bond. In case of transfer of property or other interest in the underground gathering pipeline and the principal desires to be released from the bond covering the underground gathering pipeline, the principal must proceed as follows: (1) The principal shall notify the director, in writing, of all proposed transfers of underground gathering pipelines at least thirty days before the closing date of the transfer.

Coupled entries and mutuel fields are not permitted in pick -mutuel pool wager established by the association or licensee on a designated number of races. The gross pool consists of the total amount wagered for the multiple race bet. Winning wagers are determined by the highest points totals earned after all rounds have been completed, based on cumulative mythical two dollar win, place, show wagers (a fantasy two dollar across the board wager), on one betting interest per wagering race. It is not a parlay and has no connection with or relation to other pools conducted by the association or licensee other than the utilization of live race payouts as a means of calculating players' fantasy points. b.A valid 123racing Pick -n Wager ticket shall be evidence of a binding contract between the holder of the ticket and the association or licensee, and shall constitute an acceptance of 123racing Pick-n Wager provisions and rules contained in this chapter. c.A 123racing bet may not be retracted once it has been purchased. d.A 123racing Pick-n Wager may be given a distinctive name by the association conducting the meeting or licensee, subject to commission approval, and existing license, copyrights, and patents. e.123racing Pick-n Wagers shall be conducted as follows: (1)Each player wagers into the gross pool and selects one betting interest per wagering race.

(6)As part of the announced tournament rules, and as approved by the commission, the host racing association or licensee may opt to cap the maximum odds on all fantasy payouts. (7)Each player's fantasy points will be reflected in their cumulative fantasy points totals at the end of each race. (8)Following a race being declared \"official\", the actual pari -mutuel pool payout for a fantasy across-the-board wager will be translated to points and added to a player's cumulative fantasy points totals. The host racing association or licensee may specify a maximum number of points that can be accumulated by any one wager per contest race subject to commission approval. (9)Of the bettors, the players with the highest fantasy points totals after the last leg are the \"winners\". (10)A portion of the net pari -mutuel pool as determined in advance of the contest by the host racing association or licensee and approved by the commission, designated the \"major net pool\" is distributed in accordance with subdivision i. 128(11)In addition to the major net pool, a host racing association or licensee may designate in advance of the contest and as approved by the commission a portion of the net pari-mutuel pool for carryover as follows: (a)A \"perfect pick carryover pool\" is carried over to subsequent contests until a bettor successfully selects the winning runners of all designated contests in the current contest, in which case the perfect pick carryover pool will be equally divided between the bettors successfully selecting every winning runner. (b)A \"place carryover pool\" is carried over to subsequent contests until a bettor successfully selects runners finishing first or second in all designated contests in the current contest, in which case the place carryover pool will be equally divided between the bettors successfully selecting runners finishing first or second in all designated contests. (c)A \"show carryover pool\" is carried over to subsequent contests until a bettor successfully selects runners finishing first, second, or third in all designated contests in the current contest, in which case the show carryover pool will be divided between the bettors successfully selecting runners finishing first, second, or third in all designated contests. (d)A host racing association or licensee may designate a contest on which a perfect pick carryover pool, place carryover pool, or show carryover pool is terminated and fully distributed to the best performing bettor or bettors in that contest. f.A fantasy wager on a coupled entry or field is considered a wager on the remaining part of the coupled entry or field as determined by the rules of the live corresponding race. g.If a selection in any race designates a betting interest that was scratched, excused, or determined by the stewards to be a nonstarter in the race, the fantasy wager will be on the tote favorite in that race. h.Points for dead heats will be determined by the payouts of the live corresponding race. i.The takeout and its distribution for the 123racing Pick -n Wager shall be set and approved by the host regulatory commission, but shall include the distribution of the negotiated proprietary fee. j.All tickets shall be refunded if all races comprising the 123racing Pick -n Wager are canceled or declared as a no contest.

(2)Thirty percent of the net amount in the pari -mutuel pool subject to distribution among winning ticket holders shall be distributed to the holder of the pari -mutuel ticket with the wager which has the second -highest points totals after all races have been completed. (3)Ten percent of the net amount in the pari -mutuel pool subject to distribution among winning ticket holders shall be distributed to the holder of the pari -mutuel ticket with the wager which has the third -highest points totals after all races have been completed. (4)If there are two pari -mutuel wagers that equal the highest points totals after all races have been completed, ninety percent of the net amount in the pari -mutuel pool subject to distribution shall be distributed to those ticket holders. Ten percent of the net amount in the pari -mutuel pool subject to distribution among winning ticket holders shall be distributed to the holders of pari -mutuel tickets with wagers which have the third-highest points totals after all races have been completed. (5)If there are three pari -mutuel wagers that equal the highest points totals after all races have been completed, one hundred percent of the net amount in the pari-mutuel pool subject to distribution shall be distributed to those ticket holders. (6)If one pari-mutuel ticket wager scores the highest points totals, and two or more pari-mutuel tickets wagers equal the second -highest points totals after all races have been completed, sixty percent of the net amount in the pari -mutuel pool subject to distribution shall be distributed to the highest -scoring ticket holder, and forty percent of the net amount in the pari -mutuel pool subject to distribution among winning ticket holders shall be distributed to the holders of pari -mutuel tickets which have the second-highest points totals after all races have been completed.

Decisions regarding distribution of the 123racing Pick -n Wager pool made by the commission are final. 6.Tote-X win. a.The Tote-X wagering platform uses a conventional pari -mutuel betting system and a separate pari-mutuel pool to allow ticket holders to wager among themselves on the results of individual races. However, at the time the bet is placed on a selected race through the Tote-X platform, the customer is allocated a fixed number of redeemable 130units (\"RUs\") based upon the then -current odds of the horse being wagered upon using proprietary algorithms. The algorithms are applied uniformly to all wagers in the pool. These RUs are then held within the Tote -X platform specific to that bettor. When the odds of the horses in that race change after the initial wager is placed, the value of the issued RUs fluctuates in accordance with the change in odds. The customer may then choose to redeem all or part of their RUs for the current cash value of the RUs at any time prior to the close of wagering on the selected race. The Tote -X platform calculates the final pool by combining all bets made into the Tote -X win pool on a given event and then deducting commission, refunds, redemption payouts, and applicable taxes and fees. b.For each Tote-X win pool: (1)All bets are placed into the Tote -X win pool for a specific race. (2)A valid Tote-X ticket or unique electronic identifier shall be evidence of a binding contract between the holder of the ticket and the host racing association or licensee, and shall constitute an acceptance of Tote -X provisions and rules contained in this chapter. (3)Official program numbers must be used for all Tote -X wagers. All players are responsible for ensuring each wager is placed correctly. (4)The odds calculations for Tote -X are performed on the same basis as for a conventional pari-mutuel pool. In the Tote -X platform, the proprietary mathematical algorithms will then automatically recalculate the RU values for each horse after each transaction or batch of transactions (bet or redemption), reflecting the change in the current Tote-X pool odds. (5)The Tote-X proprietary algorithms shall be applied uniformly to all wagers in the pool. (6)As approved by the commission, the host racing association or licensee may opt to cap the maximum odds on all Tote -X payouts. (7)A Tote-X wager on a coupled entry or field is considered a wager on the remaining part of the coupled entry or field as determined by the rules of the live corresponding race. (8)The customer may choose to redeem all or part of their RUs for their then -current value at any time prior to the close of the relevant pool if a horse or combination of horses has not been excused by the stewards or declared a nonstarter and the pool operator has not otherwise suspended the capacity for ticket holders to redeem their wagers. (9)A Tote-X wager may not be rescinded once it has been purchased other than through proper redemption of RUs in accordance with these rules. (10)A redemption requires the customer to surrender all or part of the underlying wager. In the event of a redemption of all RUs issued for a specific wager, the original wager shall be surrendered in its entirety. In the event of a partial redemption of the RUs issued for a specific wager, the original wager will be surrendered in proportion to the percentage of RUs being redeemed; (11)Subsequent to the deduction from the pool of each redemption payout, the remainder of the funds in the pool shall constitute the new value of all RUs which are available for subsequent redemptions. Thereafter, those RUs which are not 131redeemed prior to the closure of the pool constitute the net pool for distribution as payoff to ticket holders of wagers following a race being declared \"official\". (12)Once the Tote-X win pool is closed prior to the race, ticket holders may no longer redeem any of their RUs. (13)Each customer holding a successful bet after the race is declared \"official\" is entitled to collect according to the relevant final odds. (14)From each redemption and final pool payout a commission shall be deducted by the host racing association or licensee in accordance with state law. (15)The commission and its distribution for the Tote -X wager shall be approved by the commission. c.Notwithstanding any language to the contrary, the funds remaining in the Tote -X win pool following the payment of redemptions prior to the closure of the pool constitute the net pool for the purpose of distribution as payoff to winning ticket holders. d.Any funds remaining after the closing of the Tote -X win pool will be distributed as payoff to the winning ticket holders in the same manner as a win pool pursuant to subsection 2. e.Notwithstanding subsection 20 or any language to the contrary contained in this chapter, if, after wagering has commenced on a race, a horse not coupled with another as a betting interest is excused by the stewards or declared a nonstarter, an amount based on the then-current odds as represented by the current value of the RUs on such horse shall be deducted from the pools and refunded upon presentation and surrender of affected pari-mutuel tickets or unique electronic identifier. If more than one horse represents a single betting interest by reason of coupling as a mutuel entry or mutuel field, such single betting interest being the sole subject of a wager, then there may be no refund unless all of the horses representing such single betting interest as excused by the stewards or declared a nonstarter, or both. f.Notwithstanding subsection 21 or any language to the contrary contained in this chapter, if, after wagering has commenced on a race, the race is thereafter canceled or declared a \"no race\" by the stewards, and no redemptions have occurred prior to such, then all wagering thereon shall be refunded upon presentation and surrender of affected pari-mutuel tickets or unique electronic identifier. However, if one or more redemptions have occurred prior to the stewards canceling or declaring a \"no race\", then all wagering thereon shall be refunded at the then -current odds, as represented by the current value of the RUs, at the time of cancellation upon presentation and surrender of affected pari-mutuel tickets or unique electronic identifier. g.Notwithstanding subsection 22 or any language to the contrary contained in this chapter, in the event of an irreparable breakdown of the totalizator system during the wagering on a race, all Tote-X wagering thereon shall be refunded at the then -current odds, as represented by the current value of the RUs, at the time of irreparable breakdown upon presentation and surrender of affected pari -mutuel tickets or unique electronic identifier. h.Notwithstanding section 69.5 -01-08-05 or any language to the contrary contained in this chapter, there is no minimum payoff for a Tote -X redemption. However, any distribution made after closing of the Tote -X win pool shall be subject to the minimum payoff provisions of section 69.5 -01-08-05. i.Should circumstances occur which are not addressed by these rules, questions arising therefrom shall be resolved in accordance with general pari -mutuel practice. Decisions regarding distribution of the Tote -X pool made by the stewards are final. 1327.Tournament wager. a. The tournament wager is a separate pari-mutuel pool wager established by the licensee on a designated number of races. The gross pool consists of the total amount wagered for the multiple race bet. Winning wagers are determined by the highest points totals earned after all races have been completed. It is not a parlay and has no connection with or relation to other pools conducted by the licensee other than the utilization of live race payouts as a means of calculating players' points. b. A valid tournament wager ticket is evidence of a binding contract between the holder of the ticket and the association, and constitutes an acceptance of tournament wager provisions and rules contained in this chapter. c. A tournament wager ticket may not be retracted within two hours of post time unless otherwise approved by the commission. A tournament wager ticket may be canceled only with the approval of the licensee. d. A licensee may establish a minimum and maximum number of entries per tournament.

(b) Players may select an alternate betting interest. If there is a scratch of the player's primary selection, the alternate will be substituted. If there is also a scratch of the player's alternate selection, or if no alternate selection has been made, the selection will default to the remaining betting interest with the best post time odds as determined by win pool odds. (c) Players accrue earnings based on the actual pari-mutuel win, place, or show payouts for any correct selections, determined from tote payouts, based on a mythical win/place or win/place/show wager of a dollar value established by the licensee in advance of the contest. The licensee may establish maximum mythical earnings in advance of the opening of the contest. As an example, for a two-dollar win/place/show tournament, the maximum payout may be forty-two dollars for a successful win selection, twenty-two dollars for a successful place selection, and twelve dollars for a successful show selection. (d) Should there be a tie in earnings in the contest, ties will be broken in accordance with the following procedures: [1] The entry with the most number of winners selected will win the tie, if a tie still remains, then; [2] The entry selecting the horse with the highest mutuel win payout will win the tie, if a tie still remains, then; 133 [3] The entry with the most number of place horses selected will win the tie, if a tie still remains, then; [4] The entry with the highest mutuel place payout will win the tie, if a tie still remains, then; [5] The entry with the most number of show (third place finishers that did not win or place) horses selected will win the tie, if a tie still remains, then; and [6] The winning entry will be determined by a random draw among eligible entries. (e) A licensee may provide qualification for future or online tournaments for the entry based on their final ranking, including any tie breakers. Such an offering must be included in the tournament rules published in advance of the opening of the tournament. (f) Pari-mutuel distributions are made at the conclusion of the tournaments that are based on the pari-mutuel distribution schedule published by the licensee in advance of the opening of the tournament. (2) Survivor tournament: (a) Players select one primary betting interest for each designated tournament race. Players remain in the tournament if the player's betting interest finishes in a win, place, or show position. Players whose betting interest does not finish win, place, or show must be eliminated from the tournament. (b) Players may select an alternate betting interest. If there is a scratch of the player's primary selection, the alternate will be substituted. If there is also a scratch of the player's alternate selection, or if no alternate selection has been made, the selection will default to the remaining betting interest with the best post time odds as determined by win pool odds. (c) Players earn one point per correct selection of a betting interest finishing in a win, place, or show position as determined by existence of a pari-mutuel payout for that position. (d) If the size of the field or other circumstances produce only win/place or only win payouts, only those horses will be considered to be correct selections for the purposes of scoring. (e) In the discretion of the licensee, tiebreakers may be applied in survivor tournaments pursuant to the terms published in advance of the opening of the tournament. (f) Pari-mutuel distributions are made at the conclusion of the tournaments that are based on the pari-mutuel distribution schedule published by the licensee in advance of the opening of the contest. (3) Exacta box tournament: (a) Players select three primary betting interests for each designated tournament race. 134 (b) Players may select an alternate betting interest for each of their three primary selections. If there is a scratch of the player's primary selection, the alternate will be substituted.

(c) Players accrue earnings based on the actual pari-mutuel exacta payout for any correct selections regardless of order, determined from tote payouts, based on a mythical exacta wager of a dollar value established by the licensee in advance of the contest.

(e) Pari-mutuel distributions are made at the conclusion of the tournaments that are based on the pari-mutuel distribution schedule published by the licensee in advance of the opening of the contest. g.

Earnings or points for dead heats will be determined by the payouts of the live corresponding race. i. The takeout and its distribution for the tournament wager shall be set and approved by the host regulatory commission. j. All tickets must be refunded if all races comprising the tournament wager are canceled or declared as a no contest. The entire pool must be refunded if less than seventy percent of the tournament's designated races remain. k. After wagering closes on the first race comprising the tournament wager, the tournament is deemed closed and no entry ticket may be sold, exchanged, or canceled. No person shall be determined to hold a winning tournament wager ticket until the last designated race has been declared official. l. The licensee shall distribute the net pool to the holders of valid tickets that correctly selected the combination of finishers that generated the highest fantasy earnings or points totals through the designated races/rounds comprising the tournament wager.

Unless otherwise provided, after wagering has commenced, if a horse not coupled with another as a betting interest is excused by the stewards or is prevented from racing because of failure of the starting gate door to open properly, the wagers on such horse must be deducted from the pools, and refunded upon presentation and surrender thereof. If more than one horse represents a single betting interest by reason of coupling as a mutuel entry or mutuel field, such single betting interest being the sole subject of a wager or part of a 135combination then there may be no refund unless all of the horses representing such single betting interest are excused by the stewards or are prevented from racing because of failure of the starting gate doors to open properly, or both. 8.9.Race canceled.

The method of finalizing the reimbursement rate per unit will be through the use of the retrospective ratesetting system. 1.Retrospective ratesetting requires that an interim rate be established prior to the year in which it will be effective. ProvidersProvider agencies are required to submit a statement of budgeted costs to the department no less than annually so an interim rate may be determined. The determination of a final rate for all services begins with the reported cost of the provider'sprovider agency's operations for that fiscal year. Once it has been determined that reported costs are allowable, reasonable, and client -related, those costs are compared to the reimbursements received through the interim rate. 2.a.Settlements will be made through a recoupment or refund to the department for an overpayment or an additional payment to the provider agency for an underpayment. b.Interprovider settlements between intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities and day services will be made through a recoupment or refund to the department from the day service provider agency to correct an overpayment; or a payout to the intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, for the day service provider agency, to correct an underpayment. 3.Limitations. a.The department shall accumulate and analyze statistics on costs incurred by providersprovider agencies. Statistics may be used to establish reasonable ceiling limitations for needed services. Limitations may be established on the basis of cost of comparable facilities and services, or audited costs, and may be applied as ceilings on the overall costs, on the costs of providing services, or on the costs of specific areas of operations. The department may implement ceilings at any time, based upon the statistics available, or as required by guidelines, regulations, rules, or statutes. b.ProvidersProvider agencies, to maintain reasonable rates of reimbursement, must deliver units of service at or near their rated capacity. Upon a finding by the department that an excess idle capacity exists and has existed, the cost of which is borne by the department, the provider agency shall be notified of the department's intention to reduce the level of state financial participation or invoke the cancellation provisions of the provider agency agreement. The provider agency, within ten days of such notification, must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that the department should not invoke its authority under this provision, or must accept the department's finding. c.ProvidersProvider agencies shall not be reimbursed for services, rendered to clients, which exceed the rated occupancy of any facility as established by a fire prevention authority. d.ProvidersProvider agencies of residential services must offer services to each client three hundred sixty-five days per year, except for leap years in which three hundred sixty -six days must be offered.

(2)Family subsidy. (3)Supported living. g.(1)Days of services in facilities subject to the application of subdivision d must be provided for a minimum of three hundred thirty -five days per year per client. A reduction of payment to the provider agency in an amount equal to the rate times the number of days of service less than the minimum will be made unless the regional developmental disability program administrator determines that a failure to meet the minimum was justified. (2)For purposes of this subdivision, the fiscal year of the facility will be used, and all days before the admission, or after the discharge of the client, will be counted toward meeting the minimum. h.Salary and fringe benefit cost limits, governing the level of state financial participation, may be established by the department by calculating: (1)Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions, by program size and numbers served, and programs in and out of state; (2)Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions in state government; (3)Comparable salaries and benefits for comparable positions in the community served by the provider agency; or (4)Data from paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, taken in combination. By using private funds, providersprovider agencies may establish higher salaries and benefit levels than those established by the department. i.Management fees and costs may not exceed the lesser of two percent of administrative costs or the price of comparable services, facilities, or supplies purchased elsewhere, primarily in the local market.

When costs are incurred solely for a basic service, the costs must be assigned directly to that basic service. When costs are incurred jointly for two or more basic services, and not able to be directly assigned, the costs willmust be allocated as follows: a.Personnel. The total cost of all staff identified in payroll records must be listed by position title and distributed to basic services subject to the approval of staff -to-client ratios by the department. Time studies may be performed for one week at least quarterly for 202allocation. When no time studies exist, the applicable units must be used for allocation. When there is no definition of a unit of service, the department willmust use the unit of service for billing purposes for residential settings. b.Fringe benefits. The cost of fringe benefits must be allocated to basic services based on the ratio of the basic service personnel costs to total personnel costs. Personnel costs on which no fringe benefits are paid will beare excluded. c.Equipment. The total cost of all equipment, whether rented, leased, purchased, or depreciated, must be distributed to basic serviceservices based on usage or applicable units. d.Real property expensecost.

The total of all contractual costs must be allocated based upon applicable units or, if appropriate, included as part of the administrative costs. j.General client costs. Total general client expenses must be allocated to service categories, exclusive of production, room, and board, supported living arrangements, family support services, and extended services based on actual units of service. When determining the day support ratio of general client costs, total day support units will be divided by eight and rounded to the nearest whole number. k.Administrative costs. Total administrative expenses may be allocated to all service categories, on time studies done in compliance with subdivision a. If time studies are not available, total administrative expenses must be allocated to all service categories, exclusive of room, board, and production, based upon the ratio of the basic service cost to total cost excluding administrative and production costs. The percentage calculated for residential services must be based on total costs for training, room, and board for the specific residential service with the allocation made only to training. 2.Identification of the means of financing is to be as follows: a.Budget reports require the disclosure of all revenues currently used to finance costs and those estimated to finance future costs, inclusive of the provider'sprovider agency's estimate of state financial participation. b.Revenues must be distributed on the appropriate budget report by program. When private contributions are used to supplement or enrich services, the sum may be distributed accordingly. When contributions are held in reserve for special purposes, it may be described by narrative. 203c.The disclosure of contract income and production costs is required to establish a rate of reimbursement supplemental to, and not duplicative of, these revenues and costs. d.State financial participation in the habilitative costs associated with day supports shall not include production costs.

Income must be offset up to the total of appropriate allowable costs. If actual costs are not identifiable, income must be offset up to the total of costs described in this section. If costs relating to income are reported in more than one cost category, the income must be offset in the ratio of the costs in each cost category. These sources, and the cost to be offset, must include the following: a.Fees, the cost of the service or time for which the fee was imposed excluding those fees based on cost as established by the department. b.Insurance recoveries income, costs reported in the current year to the extent of costs allowed in the prior or current year for that loss. c.Rental income, cost of space in facilities or for equipment included in the rate of reimbursement. d.Telephone and telegraphinternet income from clientsconsumers, staff, or guests, cost of the service. e.Rental assistance or subsidy when not reported as third -party income, total costs. f.Interest or investment income, interest expense. g.Medical payments, cost of medical services included in the rate of reimbursement as appropriate. h.Respite care income when received for a reserved bed, room, board, and staff costs. i.Other income to the provider agency from local, state, or federal units of government may be determined by the department to be an offset to cost. 4.Payments to a provider agency by its vendor will beare considered as discounts, refunds, or rebates in determining allowable costs under the program even though these payments may be treated as \"contributions\" or \"unrestricted grants\" by the provider agency and the vendor. However, such payments may represent a true donation or grant, and as such may not be offset against costs. Examples include when: 204a.Payments are made by a vendor in response to building or other fundraising campaigns in which communitywide contributions are solicited. b.Payments are in addition to discounts, refunds, or rebates, which have been customarily allowed under arrangements between the provider agency and the vendor. c.The volume or value of purchases is so nominal that no relationship to the contribution can be inferred. d.The contributor is not engaged in business with the provider agency or a facility related to the provider agency. 5.If an owner or other official of a provider agency directly receives from a vendor monetary payments or goods or services for the owner's or official's own personal use as a result of the provider'sprovider agency's purchases from the vendor, the value of such payments, goods, or services constitutes a type of refund or rebate and must be applied as a reduction of the provider'sprovider agency's costs for goods or services purchased from the vendor. 6.If the purchasing function for a provider agency is performed by a central unit or organization, all discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates shouldmust be credited to the costs of the provider agency in accordance with the instructions above. These shouldmay not be treated as income of the central purchasing function or used to reduce the administrative costs of that function. Such administrative costs are, however, properly allocable to the facilities serviced by the central purchasing function. 7.Purchase discounts, allowances, refunds, and rebates are reductions of the cost of whatever was purchased. They shouldmust be used to reduce the specific costs to which they apply. If possible, they shouldmust accrue to the period to which they apply. If not, they will reduce expenses in the period in which they are received. The reduction to expense for supplies or services must be used to reduce the total cost of the goods or services for all clients without regard to whether the goods or supplies are designated for all clients or a specific group. a.\"Purchase discounts\" include cash discounts, trade, and quantity discounts. \"Cash discount\" is for prepaying or paying within a certain time of receipt of invoice. \"Trade discount\" is a reduction of cost granted certain customers. \"Quantity discounts\" are reductions of price because of the size of the order. b.Allowances are reductions granted or accepted by the creditor for damage, delay, shortage, imperfection, or other cause, excluding discounts and refunds. c.Refunds are amounts paid back by the vendor generally in recognition of damaged shipments, overpayments, or return purchases. d.Rebates represent refunds of a part of the cost of goods or services. Rebates differ from quantity discounts in that they are based on the dollar value of purchases, not the quantity of purchases. e.\"Other cost-related income\" includes amounts generated through the sale of a previously expensed item, e.g., supplies or equipment.

History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; January 1, 1989; August 1, 1992; June 1, 1995; July 1, 1995; April 1, 1996; August 1, 1997; July 1, 2001; May 1, 2006; debt expense. 1.Bad debts for charges incurred in or after July 1, 2005, and fees paid for the collections of those bad debts are allowable only as provided in this section. 2.A bad debt expense must result from nonpayment of the payment rate for an individual who is no longer receiving services from the provider agency claiming the bad debt expense. 3.The provider agency must provide documentation to the department which verifies that the provider agency made reasonable collection efforts, the debt could not be collected, and there is no likelihood of future recovery. Reasonable collection efforts include maintaining written documentation that, in making those collection efforts, the provider agency received the assistance of an attorney licensed to practice law. 4.In no circumstance may the allowable expense for the collection fee exceed the amount of the bad debt. 5.A bad debt expense shall not be allowed when it resulted from the provider'sprovider agency's failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations. 6.Before any bad debt expense may be allowed, the provider agency must have a written policy that limits the potential for bad debts and the provider agency must provide written documentation that shows it has taken action to limit bad debts for individuals who refuse to or cannot make payments. 2097.Allowable bad debt expense may not exceed debt associated with one hundred twenty days of services provided for any one individual. 8.Payments on outstanding accounts receivable shall be applied to the oldest invoices for covered services first, and then all subsequent charges until the balance is paid in full. 9.Allowable finance charges on bad debts described in this section are allowable only if the finance charges have been offset as interest income. History: Effective May 1, 2006; amended effective January principles of reimbursement for provider agency costs require that payment for services include depreciation on depreciable assets that are used to provide allowable services to clients. This includes assets that may have been fully or partially depreciated on the books of the provider agency, but are in use at the time the provider agency enters the program. The useful lives of these assets are considered not to have ended and depreciation calculated on the revised extended useful life is allowable. Likewise, a depreciation allowance is permitted on assets that are used in a normal standby or emergency capacity. Depreciation is recognized as an allocation of the cost of an asset over its estimated useful life. If any depreciated personal property asset is sold or disposed of for an amount different than its undepreciated value, the difference represents an incorrect allocation of the cost of the asset to the facility and must be included as a gain or loss on the cost report. The facility shall use the sale price in computing the gain or loss on the disposition of assets. 2.Special assessments in excess of one thousand dollars paid in a lump sum must be capitalized and depreciated. Special assessments not paid in a lump sum may be expensed as billed by the taxing authority. 3.Depreciation methods: a.A provider agency shall use the straight -line method of depreciation. All accelerated methods of depreciation, including depreciation options made available for income tax purposes, such as those offered under the asset depreciation range system, may not be used. A provider agency shall apply the method and procedure for computing depreciation on a basis consistent from year to year and shall maintain detailed schedules of individual assets. If the books of account reflect depreciation different than that submitted on the cost report, a provider agency shall prepare a reconciliation. b.For all assets obtained prior to August 1, 1997, a provider agency shall compute depreciation using a useful life of ten years for all items except vehicles, which must be depreciated over four years, and buildings, which must be depreciated over twenty-five years or more. For assets other than vehicles and buildings obtained after August 1, 1997, a provider agency may use the American hospital association depreciation guidelines as published by the American hospital publishing, inc., in \"Estimated Useful Lives of Depreciable Hospital Assets\", revised 2008 edition , to determine the useful life or the composite useful life of ten years. A provider may not use an option other than the useful life methodology the provider initially chooses to use without the department's prior written approval. A provider agency shall use a useful life of ten years for all equipment not identified in the American hospital association depreciation guidelines. c.A provider agency acquiring assets as an ongoing operation shall use as a basis for determining depreciation: 210(1)The estimated remaining life, as determined by a qualified appraiser, for land improvements, buildings, and fixed equipment; and (2)(a)A composite remaining useful life for movable equipment, determined from the seller's records; or (b)The remaining useful life for movable equipment, determined from the seller's records. 4.Acquisitions are treated as follows: a.If a depreciable asset has, at the time of its acquisition, a historical cost of at least five thousand dollars, its cost must be capitalized and depreciated in accordance with subdivision b of subsection 3. A provider agency shall capitalize as part of the cost of the asset, costs incurred during the construction of an asset, such as architectural, consulting and legal fees, and interest. b.A provider agency shall capitalize major repair and maintenance costs on equipment or buildings if they exceed five thousand dollars per project and will be depreciated in accordance with subdivision b of subsection 3. 5.A provider agency shall maintain records that provide accountability for the fixed capital assets and other assets and also provide adequate means by which depreciation can be computed and established as an allowable client -related cost. 6.The basis for depreciation is the lower of the purchase price or fair market value at the time of purchase. If the provider'sprovider agency's cash payment for a purchase is reduced by a trade -in, fair market value will consist of the sum of the book value of the trade -in plus the cash paid. 7.For depreciation and reimbursement purposes, a provider agency may record and depreciate donated depreciable assets based on the asset's fair market value. If the provider'sprovider agency's records do not contain the fair market value of the donated asset, as of the date of the donation, an appraisal must be made. An appraisal made by a recognized appraisal expert will be accepted for depreciation. 8.Provision for increased costs due to the sale of a facility may not be made. 9. If a provider finances a facility pursuant to North Dakota Century Code chapter 6 -09.6, the provider, subject to the approval of the department, may elect to be reimbursed based upon the mortgage principal payments rather than depreciation. Once an election is made by the provider, it may not be changed without department approval. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; June 1, 1995; August 1, 1997; July 1, 2001; May 1, 2004; May 1, 2006; under the program, interest must be: (1)Supported by evidence of an agreement that funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are required; 211(2)Identifiable in the provider'sprovider agency's accounting records; (3)Related to the reporting period in which the costs are incurred; (4)Necessary and proper for the operation, maintenance, or acquisition of the provider'sprovider agency's facilities used therein; (5)Unrelated to funds borrowed to purchase assets in excess of cost or fair market value; and (6)When borrowed for the purpose of making capital expenditures for assets that were owned by any other facility or service provider agency on or after July 18, 1984, limited to that amount of interest cost which such facility or service provider agency may have reported, for ratesetting purposes, had the asset undergone neither refinancing nor a change of ownership. b.In cases when it was necessary to issue bonds for financing, any bond premium or discount shallmust be accounted for and written off over the life of the bond issue. 2.Interest paid by the provider agency to partners, stockholders, or related organizations of the provider agency is not allowable as a cost except when interest expense is incurred subject to North Dakota Century Code chapter 6 -09.6. 3.A provider agency may combine or \"pool\" various funds in order to maximize the return on investment. If funds are pooled, proper records must be maintained to preserve the identity of each fund in order to permit the earned income to be related to its source. Income earned on gifts and grants does not reduce allowable interest expense. 4.Funded depreciation requirements are as follows: a.Funding of depreciation is the practice of setting aside cash or other liquid assets to be used for replacement of the assets depreciated or for other capital purposes. This provision is recommended as a means of conserving funds for the replacement of depreciable assets. It is expected that the funds will be invested to earn revenues. The revenues generated by this investment will not be considered as a reduction of allowable interest expense provided such revenues remain in the fund. b.The deposits are, in effect, made from the cash generated by the noncash expense depreciation and do not include interest income. Deposits to the funded depreciation account are generally in an amount equal to the depreciation expense charged to costs each year. In order to qualify for all provisions of funding depreciation, the minimum deposits to the account must be fifty percent of the depreciation expensed that year. Deposits in excess of accumulated depreciation are allowable; however, the interest income generated by the \"extra\" deposits will be considered as a reduction of allowable interest expense. c.Monthly or annual deposits representing depreciation must be in the funded depreciation account for six months or more to be considered as valid funding transactions. Deposits of less than six months are not eligible for the benefits of a funded depreciation account. However, if deposits invested before the six -month period remain in the account after the six-month period, the investment income for the entire period will not reduce the allowable interest expensed in that period. Total funded depreciation in excess of accumulated depreciation on client -related assets will be considered as ordinary investments and the income therefrom will be used to offset interest expense. d.Withdrawals for the acquisition of capital assets, the payment of mortgage principal on these assets and for other capital expenditures are on a first -in, first-out basis. 212e.The provider agency may not use the funds in the funded depreciation account for purposes other than the improvement, replacement, or expansion of facilities or equipment replacement or acquisition related to client services. f.Existing funded depreciation accounts must be used for all capital outlays in excess of five thousand dollars except with regard to those assets purchased exclusively with donated funds or from the operating fund, provided no amount was borrowed to complete the purchase. Should funds be borrowed, or other provisions not be met, the entire interest for the funded depreciation income account will be offset up to the entire interest expense paid by the facility for the year in question. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; June 1, 1995; July 1, 2001; January 1.Costs applicable to services, facilities, and supplies furnished to a provider agency by a related organization shall not exceed the lower of the cost to the related organization or the price of comparable services, facilities, or supplies purchased elsewhere primarily in the local market. ProvidersProvider agencies must identify such related organizations and costs in the cost report. An appropriate statement of cost and allocations must be submitted with the cost report. For cost reporting purposes, management fees will beare considered administrative costs. 2.A chain organization consists of a group of two or more service providersprovider agencies which are owned, leased, or through any other device, controlled by one business entity. 3.Home offices of chain organizations vary greatly in size, number of locations, staff, mode of operations, and services furnished to their member facilities. Although the home office of a chain is normally not a provider agency in itself, it may furnish to the individual provider agency, central administration or other services such as centralized accounting, purchasing, personnel, or management services. Only the home office's actual cost of providing such services is includable in the provider'sprovider agency's allowable costs under the program. Any services provided by the home office which are included in cost as payments to an outside provider agency will be considered a duplication of costs and not be allowed. 4. If the home office makes a loan to or borrows money from one of the components of a chain organization, the interest paid is not an allowable cost and interest income is not used to offset interest expense. 5. Payments, to related organizations, by the provider agency are limited to the actual and reasonable cost of the service received or the product purchased. 6. Provider agency shall document financial transactions between the provider agency and the related organization. The terms of such transactions must be similar as those obtained by a prudent buyer negotiating at arm's length with a willing and knowledgeable seller. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985 ; January 1, paid to a related organization. 1.A provider agency may lease a facility from a related organization within the meaning of the principles of reimbursement. In such a case, the rent paid to the lessor by the provider agency 213is not allowable as a cost , except for providers subject to chapter 75 -04-03, whose. Provider agency's rent payments shall not exceed the actual cost of mortgage payments of principal and interest. The cost of ownership of the facility would, however, be an allowable cost to the provider agency. Generally, these would be costs such as depreciation, interest on the mortgage, real estate taxes, and other property expenses attributable to the leased facility. The effect is to treat the facility as though it were owned by the provider agency. Therefore, the owner's equity in the leased assets is includable in the equity capital of the provider agency. 2.In order to be considered an allowable cost, the home office cost must be directly related to those services performed for individual providersprovider agencies and relate to client services. An appropriate share of indirect costs will also be considered. Documentation as to the time spent, the services provided, the hourly valuation of services and the allocation method used must be available to substantiate the reasonableness of the cost. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985 ; January 1, Taxes assessed against the provider agency, in accordance with the levying enactments of the several states and lower levels of government and for which the provider agency is liable for payment, are allowable costs. Tax expense may not include fines, penalties, or those taxes listed in subsection 2. 2.Taxes not allowable as costs. The following taxes are not allowable as costs: a.Federal income and excess profit taxes, including any interest or penalties paid thereon. b.State or local income and excess profit taxes. c.Taxes in connection with financing, refinancing, or refunding operation, such as taxes in the issuance of bonds, property transfers, issuance or transfers of stocks, etc. Generally, these costs are either amortized over the life of the securities or depreciated over the life of the asset. They are not, however, recognized as tax expense. d.Taxes from which exemptions are available to the provider agency. e.Taxes on property which is not used in the provision of covered services. f.Taxes, including sales taxes levied against residents and collected and remitted by the provider agency. g.Self-employment (FICA) taxes applicable to persons, including individual proprietors, partners, or members of a joint venture. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective July 1, 2001; May 1, 2006; funds. 1.Each client is allowed to retain a specific monthly amount of income for personal needs. These personal needs include such items as clothes, tobacco, or other day -to-day incidentals. This monthly allowance is not to be applied toward the client's cost of care. Generally, the 214source of income for personal needs is from social security, veterans' benefits, private income, economic assistance, or supplemental security income. 2.ProvidersProvider agencies managing client funds must maintain a current client account record in a form and manner prescribed by the department.

Nonprescription vitamins or combinations of vitamins with minerals may be paid when ordered by the attending physician and the client , parent, or guardian, or responsible relative approves such use of the client's funds. 7.Charges by the program for items or services furnished clients will be allowed as a charge against the client or outside sources, only if separate charges are also recorded by the facility 215for all clients receiving these items or services directly from the program. All such charges must be for direct, identifiable services or supplies furnished individual clients. A periodic \"flat\" charge for routine items, such as beverages, cigarettes, etc., will not be allowed. Charges may be made only after services are performed or items are delivered, and charges are not to exceed charges to all classes of clients for similar services. 8.A client's private property must be clearly marked by name. The facility must keep a record of private property.

No funds may be withdrawn from accounts of a client capable of managing the client's own funds without the client's permission. 11.Should a disagreement exist as to whether a client is capable of managing the client's own funds, a joint determination will be made by the individualperson-centered service plan team , parent, and guardian, or responsible relative in settling this dispute. The decision must be documented in the provider'sprovider agency's records. 12.On discharge, the facility must provide the client with a final accounting of personal funds and remit any balance on deposit with the facility. 13.Upon death, the balance of a client's personal incidental funds along with the name and case number, willmust be maintained in an interest -bearing account for disposition by the client's estate.

History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; June 1, 1995; following overall direct contact staff -to-client ratios shall form the basis for the determination of the rate of reimbursement for providersprovider agencies of service to individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities. Additional staff may be necessary to meet the needs of the clients and may be added subject to the approval of the department. 1.Intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded shall be individuals with intellectual disabilities are subject to the direct contact staffing requirements of title 42 CFR 483.430, Code of Federal Regulations, part 483, section 430. 2.Transitional community living facility shall maintain a one to eight direct contact staff -to-client ratio during those periods when the clients are awake and on the premises, and one direct contact staff when clients are asleep. 3.Minimally supervised living arrangements and providersprovider agencies of congregate care for the aged shall maintain one direct contact staff onsite when clients are present when required by the department. 4.In minimally supervised apartment living arrangements, one direct contact staff shall be onsite when clients are present when required by the department. 5.Supported living arrangements shall maintain a direct contact staff -to-client ratio of one to twenty. 6.Day supports shall maintain a direct contact staff -to-client ratio of one to five. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective June 1, 1985; June 1, 1995; July 1, 2001; July calculation of the total number of employees necessary to meet staff -to-client ratios is made on the basis of a full -time equivalent employee. Assuming that a full -time employee has fifty-two working weeks of five days each, twelve holidays, ten vacation days, and ten sick days per year, the actual number of days worked is two hundred twenty -eight per year. ProvidersProvider agencies who grant fewer paid absences must use a full -time equivalent calculation which reflects a higher number of working days. 2.Assuming a two hundred twenty -eight day work year: a.Staffing for the three hundred sixty -five day service provided by a residential service provider agency each year requires 1.6 full -time equivalent staff members for each shift slot to be filled at all times (two hundred twenty -eight times 1.6 equals three hundred sixty-five). b.Staffing for the two hundred sixty days of service provided by a day service provider agency each year requires 1.14 full -time equivalent staff members for each staff required by the ratio (two hundred twenty -eight times 1.14 equals two hundred sixty). 3.To calculate the number of duty hours in a week, eight hours per day for five days (day services) and eight hours per night for seven nights (sleep time) are subtracted from the total hours of the week for residential service providersprovider agencies. History: Effective July 1, 1984; amended effective July 2001; will be applied to providers ofprovider agencies for services to individuals with developmental disabilities, except distinct parts of state institutions for individuals with developmental disabilities which are certified as intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, starting the first day of a facility's first fiscal year which begins on or after July 1, 1985; provided, however, that neither this section, nor the effective date, shall preclude the application and implementation of some or all of the provisions of this chapter through contract or through official statements of department policy.

Principles of eligibility. 1.The process of determining an individual's eligibility to receive intellectual disabilities-developmental disabilities caseprogram management services involves the recognition of several criteria and an understanding of expected outcomes as each criterion is applied. Professional judgment is applied to determine the applicability of the provision of intellectual disabilities -developmental disability caseprogram management services in accordance with chapter 75-05-0675-05-04. 2.The following criteria must be used as the frame of reference for a team of at least three professionals in the human service center, led by the developmental disabilities program administrator or the administrator's designee, for the determination of an individual's eligibility for intellectual disabilities -developmental disabilities case management services. History: Effective July 1, 1991; amended effective January 1, 1997; July 1, 2012; eligibility. 1.An individual is eligible for intellectual disabilities -developmental disabilities caseprogram management services if the individual has a diagnosis of mental retardation intellectual disability which is severe enough to constitute a developmental disability. a.A diagnosis of the condition of mental retardationintellectual disability must be made by an appropriately licensed professional using diagnostic criteria accepted by the American psychiatric association. b.Determination of whether the manifestation of the condition is severe enough to constitute a developmental disability must be done in accordance with the definition of developmental disability in North Dakota Century Code section 25 -01.2-01. 2.An individual is eligible for intellectual disabilities -developmental disabilities caseprogram management services if the individual has a condition of mental retardation intellectual disability, diagnosed by an appropriately licensed professional using diagnostic criteria accepted by the American psychiatric association, which is not severe enough to constitute a developmental disability, and the individual must be able to benefit from treatment and services purchased through the developmental disability division on behalf of an individual who meets the criteria of subsection 1. 2213.An individual is eligible for intellectual disabilities -developmental disabilities caseprogram management services if the individual has a condition, other than mental illness, severe enough to constitute a developmental disability, which results in impairment of general intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior similar to that of an individual with the condition of mental retardation intellectual disability , and the individual must be able to benefit from services and intervention techniques which are so closely related to those applied to an individual with the condition of mental retardation intellectual disability that provision is appropriate. Determination of eligibility for individuals described in this subsection requires the application of professional judgment in a two -step process: a.The team must first determine whether the condition is severe enough to constitute a developmental disability. North Dakota Century Code section 25 -01.2-01 must be applied in order to determine if a developmental disability is present. The presence of a developmental disability does not establish eligibility for services through the intellectual disabilities-developmental disabilities caseprogram management services system, but does require the team to consider all assessment data and apply professional judgment in the second step. b.The team must then determine whether services can be provided to an individual determined to have a condition, other than mental illness, severe enough to constitute a developmental disability. The team must have a thorough knowledge of the condition and service needs of the applicant, as well as a thorough knowledge of services that would be appropriate through the developmental disabilities system. When considering if intellectual disabilities -developmental disabilities caseprogram management is appropriate, the team must consider factors, including: (1)Whether the individual would meet criteria appropriately used to determine the need for services in an intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities. (2)Whether appropriate services are available in the existing developmental disabilities service delivery system. (3)Whether a service, which uses intervention techniques designed to apply to an individual with intellectual disabilities, delivered by staff trained specifically in the field of intellectual disabilities, would benefit the individual. (4)Whether a service, designed for an individual with the condition of mental retardationintellectual disability , could be furnished to the individual without any significant detriment to the individual or others receiving the service. c.If the team concludes, through the application of professional judgment, that an individual's needs can be met through specific services purchased by the department for individuals who meet the criteria of subsection 1, aan intellectual disabilities-developmental disabilities caseprogram manager may be assigned. Services may be provided, subject to the limits of legislative appropriation. New services need not be developed on behalf of the individual. History: Effective January 1, 1997; amended effective July 1, 2012; service eligibility - Children birth through age two. 1.Service eligibility for children from birth through age two is based on distinct and separate criteria designed to enable preventive services to be delivered. Young children may have conditions which could result in substantial functional limitations if early and appropriate 222intervention is not provided. The collective professional judgment of the team must be exercised to determine whether the child is high risk or developmentally delayed, and if the child may need early intervention services. If a child, from birth through age two, is either high risk or developmentally delayed, the child may be included on the caseload of aan intellectual disabilities-developmental disabilities caseprogram manager and considered for those services designed to meet specific needs. Eligibility for continued service inclusion through intellectual disabilities -developmental disabilities caseprogram management must be redetermined by age three using criteria specified in section 75 -04-06-02.1. 2.For purposes of this section: a.\"Developmentally delayed\" means a child, from birth through age two: (1)Who is performing twenty -five percent below age norms in two or more of the following areas: (a)Cognitive development; (b)Gross or emotional development; or (g)Adaptive development; or (2)Who is performing at fifty percent below age norms in one or more of the following areas: (a)Cognitive development; (b)Physical development, including vision and (d)Social or emotional development; or (e)Adaptive development. b.\"High risk\" means a child, from birth through age two: (1)Who, based on a diagnosed physical or mental condition, has a high probability of becoming developmentally delayed; or (2)Who, based on informed clinical opinion which is documented by qualitative and quantitative evaluation information, has a high probability of becoming developmentally delayed. History: Effective July 1, 1991; amended effective July 1, 1993; January 1,1997; July The extent to which appropriate services other than caseprogram management services are available to eligible clients is dependent upon legislative appropriations and resources. Eligibility for caseprogram management services does not create an entitlement to services other than caseprogram management services if resources are not available.
