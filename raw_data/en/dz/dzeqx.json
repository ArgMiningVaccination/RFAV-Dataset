An estimated 11,000 newly diagnosed cases of cervical cancer occur annually in t h e United States, resulting in 3700 deaths. Globally, an estimated 493,000 new cervical cancer cases occur each year, with 274,000 deaths; more than 80% of cervical cancer deaths worldwide occur in developing countries. Human papillomavirus is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with an estimated 6.2 million individuals newly infected annually WHAT IS THE HPV VACCINE? The HPV vaccine claims to protect against some types of the human papillomavirus (HPV) that can cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Two HPV vaccines are available: HPV4 and HPV2. The ingredients are proteins of HPV Types 6, 1 1 , 16, and 18, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, yeast protein, sodium chloride, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, sodium borate, and water for injection. The Federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice recommends that all girls age 11 thru 12 years old should get vaccinated against HPV. Health care providers may also give the vaccine to girls as young as 9 years, and to girls and women aged 13 thru 26 years who haven't gotten the vaccine yet. One of the HPV vaccines is also licensed for boys and men ages 9 thru 26 years to prevent genital warts. There are two licensed HPV vaccines, Gardasil\u00ae, manufactured by Merck and Cervarix\u00ae, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline . Gardasil\u00ae was licensed for use in females, age 9- 26 years in June 2006 and for males' a g e 9 - 26 years in Oct 2009. Cervarix\u00ae was licensed for use in females age 10-25 in October 2009. IS A VACCINE EVEN NECESSARY? The first problem with using a vaccine approach is that there are over one hundred known strains of HPV, (and likely hundreds if not thousands of unknown strains) only 30 of which are even theoretically linked with cervical cancer. In addition, HPV is present in at least half the normal population , almost never causing any disease or problems whatsoever. Numerous studies have shown 70 to 90 percent of people with HPV naturally clear the virus from the body within two years of infection \u2014 with no help from drugs or vaccines . So the most effective protection from problems caused by HPV is to avoid being infected by the multiple strains of HPV by not e n g a g i n g in promiscuous, unprotected- by- condoms sex (the virus is transmitted sexually and condoms do not offer 100 percent protection) and by keeping your body's immune system strong and healthy through natural health practices. HPV has never been scientifically proven to be a pathogen for cervical cancer All that has ever been shown is that HPV is sometimes present in cervical cancer tissue, but as we know it's also present in half the normal population. There is a complete lack of evidence that cervical cancer appears in women with HPV more often than in women without it. And yet this will be the primary objective of the vaccine: to pretend to eliminate this ubiquitous virus from the body. The original p h r a s e used by Merck to link HPV with cervical cancer w a s \"there is a strong connection.\" How that phrase got transformed to 'is the cause of' in the past two years is more a matter of shrewd marketing than of quality science. The second obstacle to credibility with the HPV vaccine is that the average age for cervical cancer is 50 years. But the plan is to mandate the HPV vaccine to girls as young as 11 y e a r s of age and on certain occasions as young as 9 y e a r s of a g e . And the manufacturer is only claiming efficacy for 5 years. So using their own statistics, this makes the vaccine worthless in the long run, because by the time most females need immunity, it will have worn off long ago. QUALITY OF THE TEST STUDIES OF HPV The FDA allowed Merck to use a potentially reactive aluminum containing placebo as a control for most trial participants, rather than a non-reactive saline solution placebo. A reactive placebo can artificially increase the appearance of safety of an e x p e r i m e n t a l d r u g or vaccine in a clinical trial. For example, if we w a n t e d to test the safety and efficacy of a carbonated soft drink on teeth, we would use water as a control or comparison. In the case of Merck clinical trials, they decided to use another soft-drink ( which of course manipulated the data ). Gardasil contains 225 mcg of aluminum and, although aluminum adjuvants have been used in vaccines for decades, they were never tested for safety in clinical trials . Merck and the FDA did not disclose how much aluminum was in the placebo. Here's what is alarming Almost 90% of Gardasil recipients and 8 5 % of aluminum placebo recipients followed- up for safety reported one or more adverse events within 15 days of vaccination. In addition, pain and swelling at the injection site occurred in approximately 83% of Gardasil and 73% of a l u m i n u m p l a c e b o recipients. Sixty percent of those who got Gardasil or the aluminum placebo had systemic adverse events including headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgia. The point here is that there is too little long term safety and effectiveness data to recommend Gardasil for universal use, especially mandatory use ADVERSE REACTIONS TO THE HPV VACCINE As of September 15, 2011, approximately 40 million doses of Gardasil\u00ae were distributed in the U.S. and VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) received a total of 20,096 reports of adverse events following Gardasil\u00ae vaccination: 19,075 reports among females and 569 reports for males, of which 504 reports were received after the vaccine was licensed for males in October 2009. VAERS received 452 reports of unknown gender. Adverse reactions that have been reported include: xpain xswelling at neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness and atrophy) As of September 15, 2011, there have been a total 71 VAERS reports of death among those who have received Gardasil\u00ae. There were 57 reports among females, 3 were among males, and 11 were reports of unknown gender or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine and some reports indicated a cause of death unrelated to vaccination. Since licensed in October 2009, uptake of Cervarix\u00ae vaccination in the U.S. has been very low. As of September 2011, there have been 52 VAERS reports of adverse events following Cervarix\u00ae vaccination in the U.S. It is important to note historically only a fraction of adverse events involving vaccines ever get reported and the longer the time between the administration of the vaccine and the adverse event occurring, the less likely it will be attributed to the initial administration. This means that the vast majority of damages caused by vaccines like HPV are never reported. Even the Journal of the American Medical Association, normally a staunch defender of vaccines, has voiced its concern about a mandatory HPV vaccine. The AMA Journal of American Medicine (JAMA) warns Legislators about mandatory HPV vaccine: The HPV vaccine is supported by limited efficacy and safety data. Clinical trials have thus far involved a relatively small population for a limited period of follow- up (5 years). The vaccine has not been evaluated for efficacy among younger girls (aged 9 to 15 years). Yet, if the vaccine were required nationwide , it would be administered to some 2 million girls and young women, most of them between 11 and 12 years old and some as young as 9 years old. The longer-term effectiveness and safety of the vaccine still need to be evaluated among a large population , and particularly among younger girls. Given that the overall prevalence of HPV types associated with cervical cancer is relatively low (3.4%) and that the long-term effects are unknown, it is unwise to require a young girl with a very low lifetime risk of cervical cancer to be vaccinated \u0011 .

Saville, M, Reports of Health Concerns Following HPV Vaccination CDC October 24, 2011The Lancet, Volume 377, Issue 9783 , Pages 2085 - 2092, 18 June 2011 THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF A DOCTOR OF CHIR OPR ACTIC Educational requirements for doctors of chiropractic are among the most stringent of any of the health care professions. The typical applicant at a chiroprac tic college has already acquired nearly four years of pre-medi cal unde rgraduate college education, including courses in biology, inorgan ic and organ ic chem istry, physics, psycholo gy and related lab work. Once accepted into an accredited chiroprac tic college, the requirements become even more demandi ng \u2014 four to five acad emic years of professional study are the standard. Because of the hands-on nature of chiroprac tic, and the intricate adjusting techn iques, a significant portion of time is spent in clinical training. Doctors of chiropract ic \u2014 who are licensed to practice in all 50 states, the District of Columbi a, and in many nations around the world \u2014 undergo a rigorous education in the healing sciences, similar to that of medical doctors. In some areas, such as anatomy, physiology, rehabilitatio n, nutrition and public health, they receive more intensive educat ion than their MD counterparts. Like other primary health care doctors, chiropractic studen ts spend a significant portion of their curriculum studying clinical subjects related to evaluating and caring for patients. Typica lly, as part of their professional trainin g, they must comp lete a minimum of a one-year clinical-b ased program dealing with actual patient care. In total, the curriculum includes a minimum of 4,200 hours of classroom, laboratory and clinical experience . The course of study is approved by an accrediting agency which is fully recog nized by the U.S. Department of Education. This has been the case for more than three decades. Records from insura nce and court cases have constantly shown that chiro practic is the safest portal of entry health care available to the public today. Although no healthcare procedures are 100% safe, chiro practic stands on its record of safety and effectiveness unmatche d in healthcare. The chiroprac tic adjustme nt is a safe, efficie nt procedure which is perform ed nearly one million times every working day in the United States. There is a singular lack of actuarial data that would justify conc luding that chiroprac tic care is in any way harmful or dangerous. Chiropractic care is non- invasiv e, therefore, the body 's response to chiroprac tic care is far more predictab le than its reactions to drug treatments or surgical procedures. Of the nearly one million adjustments given every day in this coun try, comp licatio ns are exceedi ngly rare. COMPLIMENTS OF Dr. Scott Herman 4400 W. "}
