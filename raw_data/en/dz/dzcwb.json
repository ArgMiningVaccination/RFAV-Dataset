It can be experimental and experiential. This is a retrospective analysis of the pranic energy perception data collected for an exploratory study conducted in 2014 using the convenience sampling method. This paper describes the experiences of 100 participants during a hand sensitization practice. Participants were guided to feel the prana between their hands according to prescribed steps in the pranic healing technique, taught by Master Choa Kok Sui. The experiences reported by participants were analyzed by three independent judges and one expert using the qualitative content analysis technique introduced by Strauss and Corbin. Responses were first grouped according to nine elements. These elements were categorized under four major properties - positive experience, experience of awareness, energy experience, and feedback on the study program. These properties were further divided into two categories - experiences and feedback - based on the theme they cover. Participants experienced various sensations, which demonstrates that energy can be felt, and can benefit one's affective and physical state. Because of this qualitative content analysis, we have a better understanding of the various ways people perceive, experience, and benefit from pranic energy experiences.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common lifestyle disorder that has become a major international public health concern affecting young women of reproductive age. Homeopathy aims to provide an individual with optimal health on all levels-emotional, mental, physical and spiritual. Homeopathy's goal is to promote an individual's overall well-being rather than just treat symptoms. Dr. Boenninghausen's unique contribution to the promotion of scientific prescribing in homeopathic practice is the concept of remedy relationship and its reportorial analysis. Homeopathy takes into account a person's natural environment and lifestyle. Then, a homeopathic physician provides treatment that closely matches individual symptoms and recommends homeopathy remedies for the same. A 22-year-old female came into the homeopathic outpatient department (OPD) with complaints of irregular menses, pustular acne and constipation. An ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis was done to confirm the diagnosis of POCS. Other investigations were performed, including thyroid function tests and hormonal assays, to rule out the presence of other disorders. The case was managed with homeopathic medicines, which were prescribed per Hahnemannian guidelines after referring relationship of remedies.

Stress is a key contributor to several major life-threatening illnesses including depression and cardiovascular disease. Behavioral strategies that enable individuals to regulate stress responses can lead to improved health and well-being. Such practices may also help reduce required clinical interventions, ease pressure on the National Health Service (NHS), and reduce the need for medical and psychological treatments. This study explores the effects of a novel mind-body therapy for stress reduction and enhanced well-being. A single-group longitudinal intervention design was applied in a study comprising 29 healthy volunteers. The 10-day program was delivered online and consisted of deep-breathing exercises, cold-water exposure, and mindfulness meditation. Participant measures of perceived stress, depression symptoms, and mental well-being were taken at baseline and after completing the 10-day program. A MANOVA analysis revealed significant pre-post intervention differences for all psychometric measures, suggesting the intervention elicited improvements in symptoms of stress, well-being, and depression. This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the efficacy of an innovative mind-body therapy that may be learned and used by individuals to help modulate stress responses, improve mood levels, and enhance well-being. Future research could utilize multi-modal controlled study designs to understand the psychophysiological mechanisms associated with the benefits this practice may generate. [Qigong in Perceptual Auditory Attention: Tool to Improve Sound Integration in Autism Spectrum Disorders.

A database of peer-reviewed journal articles exploring the emerging sub-specialty known as \"energy psychology\" was assessed. This paper focuses on the 245 clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic evaluations, and theory pieces examining energy psychology protocols that include tapping on acupuncture points (acupoints), the most frequently used and investigated intervention in energy psychology. The review derives 6 premises about the method's efficacy, speed, durability, and physiologic effects that have enough empirical support (at least 6 clinical trials each) to serve in delineating and making claims about the approach. These include that acupoint tapping protocols (a) are effective in treating a range of clinical conditions, (b) are rapid compared to conventional treatments, (c) lead to durable benefits, (d) produce changes in biologic markers that corroborate the subjective assessments of clients, (e) are a critical ingredient for the demonstrated clinical effects and (f) send signals that can increase or decrease arousal in specific areas of the brain. Further consideration of the mechanisms that lead to the reported rapid, durable outcomes suggest that the approach has an unusual capacity for revising outdated mental models. Specifically, a hypothesis is developed proposing that acupoint tapping protocols are facile for producing vivid and emotionally intense experiences that contradict outdated mental models. Such mismatches between what is expected and what actually occurs, called \"prediction errors,\" have been shown to be an essential requirement for substantially altering a maladaptive mental model and reconsolidating a revised mental model "}
