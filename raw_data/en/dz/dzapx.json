Adult BOOSTER Adult BOOSTER Adult BOOSTER - 0.5 mL Td booster every 10 years. - Tdap x 1 (lifetime) should replace Td for adults without prior Tdap dose. - As of 2020, either Tdap or Td can be used for q 10 yr boosters. Pediatric PRIMARY SERIES Pediatric PRIMARY SERIES Pediatric PRIMARY SERIES - INFANRIX or DAPTACEL (DTaP): 0.5 mL IM dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months and 4-6 years for 5 total doses - DT, when pertussis vaccine contraindicated: starting at 6 weeks administer three doses of 0.5 mL IM 4 to 8 weeks apart, followed by 2 booster doses, administered at 15 to 18 months of age and at 4 to 6 years of age - Other combination vaccines exist that include DTaP/DT and may be substituted for DTaP or DT as appropriate. Pediatric BOOSTER Pediatric BOOSTER Pediatric BOOSTER - INFANRIX or DAPTACEL (DTaP): 0.5 mL IM given according to ACIP primary schedule or catch-up schedule - DT, for children < 7 years of age in whom pertussis vaccine is contraindicated: 0.5 mL IM given according to ACIP primary schedule or catch-up schedule - TdaP (ADACEL or BOOSTRIX): single 0.5 mL IM at age 11-12 years. It may be administered to children 7 years and older according to the ACIP catch-up schedule. - Other combination vaccines exist that include DTaP/DT/Tdap/Td and may be substituted for DTaP, DT, Tdap, or Td as appropriate. ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS GENERAL GENERAL GENERAL - Generally well tolerated COMMON COMMON COMMON - Pain and tenderness at the injection site; rate increases with more doses RARE RARE RARE - Anaphylaxis - Encephalopathy - Arthralgia - Fever - Guillain-Barre syndrome - Arthus reaction (severe pain, swelling, induration, edema, hemorrhage, and occasional local necrosis) VACCINE/DRUG INTERACTIONS VACCINE/DRUG INTERACTIONS VACCINE/DRUG INTERACTIONS - The simultaneous administration of DT, MMR, OPV, or inactivated [poliovirus vaccine (IPV)](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540446/all/Polio_Vaccine), - Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune response to vaccines. CONTRAINDICATIONS CONTRAINDICATIONS CONTRAINDICATIONS - History of anaphylaxis to vaccine components. - Encephalopathy within 7 days of administration of pertussis vaccine. - Use with caution with history of Guillain-Barre syndrome (within 6 weeks after previous tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine), moderate or acute severe illness, unstable neurological conditions, and Arthus hypersensitivity reaction. IMMUNE RESPONSE IMMUNE RESPONSE IMMUNE RESPONSE - The response is usually good, but reduced in the elderly. - Anti-tetanus response: anti-tetanus levels >0.1 IU/mL achieved in nearly 100% and booster response was 90-93%. CLINICAL EFFICACY CLINICAL EFFICACY CLINICAL EFFICACY - The vaccine is very effective, with ~100% efficacy. - 18 tetanus cases were reported in the U.S. in 2009 and have remained in this range annually since. - Almost all cases were reported in individuals who were never vaccinated or completed series but did not receive boosters. OTHER INFORMATION OTHER INFORMATION OTHER INFORMATION - Need: about 25% of U.S. adults > 70 yrs to have protective tetanus ab titers. - Most cases in the U.S. occur in intravenous drug users, individuals with diabetes; presumed underimmunized, waning or no immunity. - DT: pediatric preparation, contraindicated in persons >7 yrs. - ADACEL contains the same tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and five pertussis antigens as those in DAPTACEL (pediatric DTaP), but ADACEL is formulated with reduced quantities of diphtheria toxoid and detoxified pertussis toxin. - Use in HIV-positive patients - This purified toxin vaccine is considered to be well-tolerated among people with HIV. Use general indications for vaccination. The immune response is likely best when the CD4 count is >200 cells/mm3. FOLLOW UP FOLLOW UP FOLLOW UP - Td is preferred for adults (fewer local reactions) and during pregnancy. - Adults should receive Tdap x 1 as a primary series, booster or with wound management. - Wounds - Minor: - < 3 prior Td doses or unknown: give Td - > 3 doses: Td if >5 yrs since the last booster - Severe or contaminated: - < 3 prior Td doses: Td + TIG - > 3 doses: give Td if > 5yrs since last Td booster - TIG (tetanus immune globulin): administer if < 3 doses Td or unknown + contaminated wound (dirt, stool, saliva, soil), crush, burn or frostbite. - TIG: tetanus Immune globulin 500 units IM (prophylaxis), or 3,000-10,000 units (active tetanus). - Minor: Basis for recommendation Basis for recommendation Basis for recommendation - Havers FP, Moro PL, Hunter P, et al.
