By identifying and removing the obstacles that block the healing process, one can attain optimal health and happiness. What is Naturopathic Medicine? Naturopathic medicine integrates natural, nontoxic therapies from centuries-old traditions with today's modern advances of our health care system. A Naturopathic Physician (N.D.) is a primary care practitioner who emphasizes whole-patient wellness. Prevention and lifestyle management are important tools patients use to achieve optimal health and wellness. Naturopathic medicine strives to find the underlying causes of a patient's condition rather than focusing on symptomatic treatment. Naturopathic physicians work with other medical and health professionals for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. Naturopaths are well trained in the medical sciences and have extensive training in natural therapies such as therapeutic nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, naturopathic manipulative therapy, and Chinese medicine.
