Vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are the best tools for providing protection against serious disease, hospitalization, and death resulting from COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 vaccines now are approved for use in patients 6 months and older. However, in the pediatric population, vaccine uptake continues to bevery slow, especially in children 6 months to 4 years of age, of whom only 7% have received 1 dose of the vaccine.1 In children 5 to 11 years of age, only 30% have completed the 2-dose vaccination series.1 As parents continue to debate whether to get their children vaccinated, COVID-19 continues to surge in various communities around the country, with the Omicron subvariant BA.5 now accounting for almost 90% of cases in the United States.1 BA.5 is the most highly transmissible of all the COVID-19 variants and is able to evade immunity from prior infection and vaccination. Having high COVID-19 antibody titers provides increased protection against serious infection, hospitalization, and death due to BA.5. This emphasizes the importance of being vaccinated, including getting a booster dose of vaccine if eligible. There are several new COVID-19 vaccines in development to address the emergence of Omicron and its subvariants: COVID-19 and its variants are here to stay. The development of vaccines that are effective in preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death is the best method of protection for people of all ages. References 1.
