Introduction Adult -onset Still's disease ( AOSD ) is a relatively rare multisystem autoinflammator y disorder of unknown aetiology with an incidence of approximately 1-2 per million. It is estimated there are between 55-110 incident cases per year and an estimated prevalence of between 400-800 patients in England. Typically patients present with high spiking fever, polyarthritis, lymphadenopathy, evanescent rash, sore throat and a prominent leucocytosis. There are a number of other recognised clinical manifestations of AOSD including hepatospl enomegaly, weight loss, myalgia and pericarditis. Diagnosis is difficult due to the wide range of differential diagnoses and lack of specific diagnostic tests. This means that the full spectrum of AOSD may not be recognised. Various diagnostic criteria have been developed, but the Yamaguchi classification (Yamaguchi M. et. al. 1992) criteria are most frequently used. Five or more criteria are required of which two or more must be major : - Major criteria Fever >39 \u00b0C, lasting 1 week or longer Arthralgia or arthritis, lasting 2 weeks or longer Typical rash Leuc ocytosis >10,000/mm3 with >80% polymorphonuclear cells - Minor criteria Sore throat Recent development of significa nt lymphadenopathy Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly Abnormal liver function tests Negative tests for antinuclear antibody (IF) and rheumatoid factor (IgM) - Exclusion criteria Infections Malignancies (mainly malignant lymphoma) Other rheumat ic disease (mainly systemic vasculitides) . Based on the predomi nant symptoms, disease activity and evolution, two phenotypes of AOSD have been described. One is a systemic form which has an acute onset. These patients tend to be highly symptomatic with fevers, weight loss and other systemic manifestations (Group 1). In patients with the systemic predominant form, the course of the disease might be monocyclic and self-limiting, intermittent or polycyclic. The current literature suggests that on average 30% of patients develop a monocyclic course, 30% a polycyclic course, and 40% a chronic cours e. The other disease type is the arthritis predominant form of AOSD . This usually has an indolent onset (Group 2). Systemic symptoms are less well defined and a subset of patients develop a chronic erosive arthritis. First line treatment for AOSD consists of non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. NSAIDs can be used for symptomatic control during diagnostic work up. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, patients are initially treated with corticosteroids (0.8-1.0 mg/kg/da y). Methotrexate (MTX) (7.5-20 mg/week) can be added for patients who fail to achieve remission or are dependent on steroids for symptomatic control. Clinical outcomes following treatment of AOSD i nclude resolution of disease flare, clinical remission, norm alisation of biochemical markers (e.g. C-reactive protein ( CRP )), improved serum amyloid levels and improvement in quality of life. In patients that fail to achieve remission after use of corticosteroids and m ethotrexate, 5 the use of anakinra has been suggested as a follow on therapy . Anakinra is a biologic agent that blocks receptors for interleukin-1 (IL- 1). IL-1 causes inflammation of joints and joint damage. [Kineret ( Anakinra), EMA, 2016]. Anakinra is licensed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) . Anakinra is not licensed for use in AOSD. NICE has reviewed a nakinra for use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and does not recommend anakinra for the treatment of RA except in the context of a controlled, long- term clinical study (NICE, 2009). NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) has not reviewed a nakinra for use in AOSD. Tocilizumab has also been suggested as a treatment in AOSD patients with the chronic arthritis predominant form (Group 2) refractory to MTX and patients in Group 1 who have failed to respond to MTX and anakinra. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to the receptor for interleukin-6 (IL-6) which is responsible for causing inflammation (Tocilizumab - RoActemra, EMA, 2009). Tocilizumab (RoActemra \u00ae, EMA, 2016) in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is licensed for the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults not previously treated with MTX and the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tu mour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists Tocilizumab is also licensed for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in patients over 2 years , who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs and systemic corticoster oids. Tocilizumab can be given as monotherapy or in combination with MTX. NICE has not reviewed t ocilizumab for use in Adult -onset Still's disease. It has published a technology appraisal guidance (TA238) recommending tocilizumab as a treatment for some children and young people with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis that is refractory to standard treatment (NICE, 2011) . NICE (TAG375, 2016) has recommended tocilizumab in combination with methotrexate for treating RA if the disease activity score (DAS28) is greater than 5.1 and has not responded to intensive therapy with a combination of conventional DMARDs. 6 2. Summary of results Anakinra A total of five papers met the inclusion criteria determined on the basis of the research questions in the Population Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO ). The papers varied significantly in the baseline characteristics of the patients included, the dosage and frequency of drug administration, the use of concurrent therapy and the previous therapies used by the patients . Patients in these studies were predominantly Group 2 (with systemic signs and symptoms and joint manifestations) . The published studies have considered a relatively small cohort of patients and no systematic reviews were identified during the literature search. The majority of the studies reviewed were retrospective case series (Ortiz - Sanjuan 2011) and these may be subject to bias in publication, reporting and selection and may not take account of all confounding factors. This may limit the generalisability of the study findings to a larger population. One open label randomised multicentre study has been included that compares a nakinra and Disease Modifying Anti -Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs ). The main outcome measures reported were resolution of disease flares, reduction in steroid dose (steroid sparing) and clinical remission (defined as absence/reduction of fever, joint manifestati ons and lymphadenopathy along with normalisation or Two papers reported physician global assessment score and quality of life (Lequerre et.al. 2008; Laskari et.al. 2011) . Follow up varied from 12 months (Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al. 2015) to 27 months (Lequerre et. al. 2008). The studies with shorter follow up periods may not have had sufficient time to recor d medium to long term efficacy and safety of the drug. The studies evaluated some patients on anakinra as monotherapy and some where a nakinra was given in combination with other drugs (for example methotr exate and/or prednisolone). However as results for all patients were pooled it is not possible to ascer tain the specific effect of a nakinra as monotherapy. There appeared to be a greater improvement in systemic signs and symptoms after the introduction of anakinra compared to the improvement in joint al. 2011, Lequerre et. al. 2008). Detail was not presented on response by AOSD sub-group and the majority of these patients were taking combination therapy. Three studies (Ortiz -Sanjuan et. al. 2015, Lequerr e et.al. 2008, Laskari et. al. 2011) report ed statistically significant reductions in median corticosteroid dosage after anakinra administration. Anakinra was administered in combination with DMARDs. A statistically significant reduction in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR ) and et.al. (2008) and Laskari et.al. (2011) and significant reduction in the mean number of swollen and tender joints was reported by Lequerre et.al (2008). Adverse events varied in frequency and severity. The most commonly reported side effects were cutaneous reactions. These included rash (Ortiz (2011) n=3/25), localised injection site reactions (one severity grade 1 and one severity grade 2 ISR requiring hospitalisation ( Nordstrom et.al al (2013),n=28), Laskari et al (2011) n=5/25) 7 which in some cases lead to discontinuation of medication. Some patients discontinued their medication due to the severity of the rash ((n=2, Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al (2015)) Another commonly reported side effect was infection including urinary tract infections (UTIs), n=7/25, Rossi -Semerano et. al. (2015) ). Other side effects reported included single cases of other infections (for example bronchitis), hepatitis and hepatotoxicity. There were no published studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a nakinra and/or comparator therapies in the treatment of refractor y adult-onset Still's disease. Tocilizumab A total of four papers met the inclusion criteria determined on the basis of the research questions in the Population Intervention, Comparator Outcomes (PICO ). A case series published by Cipriani et. al. (2014) (n=11), a retrospective multi -centre open label study by Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al. (2014) (n=34), a prospective cohort study by Puechal et. al. (2011) (n=14) and a retrospective questionnaire based survey study by Elkayam et. al. (2014) (n=15). The papers varied significantly in the baseline characteristics of the patients included, the dosage and frequency of drug administration, the use of concurrent therapy and the previous therapies used by the patients . Patients in these studies were predominantly group 2. It was not possible to separate out the results for the two patient groups which makes it challenging to make specific recommendations for each sub -group of AOSD. While most studies state that patients had refractory disease their complete treatment history is not stated, so there may be patients included in the results who may not have had refractory disease. There were no randomised controlled trials or systematic reviews identified in literature. The design of the studies mean they may be subject to selection , publication and reporting bias and may not take account of al l confounding factors. This may limit the generalisability of the studies to a larger population. The main outcome measures included were impact on systemic disease features (Cipriani et.al. 2014), reduction in inflammatory markers (Elkayam et. al. 2014) and steroid sparing (Ortuz -Sanjuan et. al. 2014, Elkayam et. al. 2014). The retrospective nature of some of the studies also limits the range of outcomes measured and reported. Follow up varied from 6 months (Elkayam et.al. 2014 and Puechal et.al. 2011) to 12 2014 and Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al. 2014) . The variability in the follow up duration means that long term efficacy and safety of t ocilizumab cannot be fully evaluated. The studies evaluated some patients on tocilizumab as monotherapy and some for whom tocilizumab was given in combination with other drugs (for example prednisolone). However as results for all patients were pooled it is not possible to ascertain the specific effect of tocilizumab as monotherapy. There appears to be evidence of effectiveness in the studies i n modifying features of the disease such as reduction in median disease activity score, significant improvement in joint assessment (P<0.05) and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) global assessment ( P<0.005) 8 reported (Cipriani et.al. 2014). Of the 11 patients in this study 8 patients received Tocilizumab in combination with MTX and prednisolone and 3 had t ocilizumab with prednisolone only. A statistically significant reduction in mean tender joints was reported by Elkayam et.al. ( 2014) (P<0.05). Other studies report on score (EULAR ) remission (Cipriani et.al. 2014) (Puechal et.al. 2011) a nd substantial but not significant reduction in joint manifestations (Ortiz -Sanjuan, 2014). Detail was not presented on response by AOSD su b-group. Elkayam (2014) reports significant reduction in mean ESR and CRP values (P<0.05) . Two studies reporting a statistically significant steroid sparing effect (Ortiz-Sanjuan et.al. 2014, and Elkayam et.al. 2014). Adverse events varied in frequency and severity. The most commonly reported side effect was infection including upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), herpes zoster, pneumonia and UTI (Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al (2014) (n=10/34), Cipriani et al (2014) n=1/11). In some cases this lead to patients discontinuing medication. Another commonly reported side effect was injection site reaction (Cipriani et al (2014) n=2/11). Systemic flare was also reported (Cipriani et al (2014) n=3/11). Other side effects reported included single cases of hepatotoxicity. There were no published studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of tocilizumab and/or comparator therapies in the treatment of refractory adult-onset Still's disease. . 9 3. Methodology A description of the Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes (PICO) document to assist with this review was prepared by c linical leads from NHS England and Public H ealth leads of the PWG (Policy Working Group) . The following sources were searched for relevant publications : EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Clinicaltrials.gov, NHS Evidence, Cochrane library and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (section 11 includes search terms). National and international gui delines publ ished were examined and referenced where relevant. The titles and abstracts of the results from the literature searches were assessed using the criteria included in the completed PICO template. Full text version of papers that appeared potentially useful in addressing the research questions were obtained and reviewed to determine whether they were appropriate for inclusion in this evidence review. Of the total 505 studies identified, 320 abstracts relevant to this topic were reviewed, 92 full papers were extracted and 9 full papers were selected for inclusion and are summarised in this review. Evidence with results were extracted from the selected papers and recorded in evidence summary tables ( Table 7 below ). Only outcomes specified in t he PICO were extracted. All papers included in this review were assess ed for their quality and graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria (GRADE) (Section 8) . 10 4. Results The evidence search identified a total of 320 abstracts relevant to the topic that were reviewed. 92 papers were extracted for further review and 9 papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria to address the research questions in the PICO, were selected for inclusion (5 for anakinra and 4 for t ocilizumab) which are summarised in this review . The studies selected for inclusion in this review were assessed on the basis of the criteria and research questions included in the PICO . Anakinra Five papers were identified that eval uated anakinra in refractory a dult-onset Still's disease - an observational retrospective open label multicentre study by Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al. (2015) , an open randomised multi -centre trial by Nordstrom et.al. (2012), a retrospective questionnaire based study by , Giampetro et.al. (2013), a retrospective questionnaire based study by Lequerre et.al. (2008) and a retrospective case series study by Laskari et.al. (2011) . There were no systematic review s or single or double blind trial s comparing anakinra with the comparator therapies . There were no studies of cost-effectiveness of a nakinra for this patient population. Clinical effectiveness 1. Is anakinra a clinically effective treatment in patients with adult onset Stills disease (Group 1) whose symptoms and biochemical markers remain inadequately controlled after treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate? In the retrospective open label multi -centr e study by Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al (2015) 41 patients were prescribed anakinra (100mg as a daily subcutaneous injection) . Patients received anakinra as a monotherapy (n=12) or combined with immunosuppressive drugs (n=29) - usually methotrexate. This study predominantly included group 2 patients (36 out of 41 patients had joint manifestations). After 1 year , the prevalence of joint manifestations decreased from 87.8% to 41.5%, cutaneous manifes and lymphadenopathy from 26.8% to 4.9%. N o statistical testing was reported. The study reports reduction s in the proportion of patients with abnormal elevation of CRP from 90.2% to 46.3%, ESR from 78% to 22% and reduction in abnormal elevation of ferritin levels from 63.4% to 36.6% . The proportion of patients with leucocytosis reduced from 65.9% to 14.6% and the proportion with anaemia reduced from 56.1% to 9.8% . No statistical testing was reported. Significa nt cortico steroid sparing effects were reported at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months (P<0.01). The median prednisolo ne dosage of 20mg/day at baseline reduced to 5mg at the end of 1 year. While improvement in systemic symptoms has been reported, joint involvement was persistent in 41.5% of patients after 1 year . The independent effects of anakinra cannot be clearly established as combined results were presented for patients on both monotherapy and combination therapy . It was not possible to separate out the results for the two patient groups which makes it challenging to make specific recommendations for each sub-group of AOSD. In the open randomised, multicentre study by Nordstrom et.al (2012) 12 patients were treated with anakinra (100mg subcutaneous injection daily) and 10 were treated with 11 DMARDs (6 on MTX, 2 on azathioprine (AZA), 2 on leflunomide (LEF) ). All patients also received prednisolone (10mg/day ) and NSAID s if required. At baseline, patients presented with articular manifestations measured as tender joints (14% in DMARD group and 20% in anakinra group). Normalisation of CRP in both groups was reported by week 8. At week 24, 6 of the 12 patients given anakinra had achieved remission (defined as 8 weeks afebrile in the absence of NSAIDs, decrease in CRP and ferritin to reference limits and normal joint c ounts). 2 of the 10 patients on DMARDs achieved remission at the same time point. N o statistical testing was reported to quantify this difference. By week 24, 3 patients on anakinra but none in the DMARD group were able to disc ontinue oral corticosteroids (P=0.22). More patients on anakinra than on DMARD achieved improvements in the SF36 physical health summary (P=0.011). In the retrospective questionnaire based study by Giampetro et.al (2013) 28 patients were treated with anakinra (100mg/day ). 19 of the 2 8 (68%) received anakinra in combination with MTX (dose ranging between 7.5 and 40mg/week), 1 patient received the drug in combination with hydroxychloroquine, 1 in combination with azathioprine ( AZA) and 1 in combination with mycophenolate mofetil . 6 patients received anakinra as monotherapy . At 3 months, 15 of the 28 (54% ) achieved remission and 9 of the 28 ( 32%) had achieved a partial response to treatment. 24 of the 28 patients (86% ) were still being treated with anakinra at 3 months . 4 of the 6 patients on anakinra as a monotherapy achieved complete remission and 1 patient achieved partial remission. A m ean prednisol one dose reduction from 34.4mg/day at time of introduction of anakinra to 7.9mg/day mg/day (n=15) was also reported. As most results were reported for the whole cohort i t is difficult to establish a definitive effect of anakinra as monotherapy. At 23 months, 16 (57%) patients were still being treated with anakinra with 12 (42%) in complete remission. 4 (14%) patients showed a partial response with persistence of musculoskeletal symptoms. This was a small study with no statistical testing. In the retrospective questionnaire based study by Lequerre et.al (2008) of the 15 patients studied, 11 were administered anakinra in combination with MTX or another DMARD ( 1 with r ituximab and 1 with cyclophosphamide). 10 patients had chronic arthritic disease with systemic flares, 3 had systemic disease and 2 showed no systemic symptoms but active articular involvement. At 3 months, 11 (73%) patients reported improvement in clinical and biological disease markers. ESR reduced from 74mm/h to reduced from 11.9 to 7.5 (P= 0.017). There was also s ignificant improvement in joint manifestations - mean tender joint count reduced from 8.5 to 1.5 (P= 0.0002) and mean swollen joint s reduced from 5.9 to 0.9 (P= 0.0005) . Significant steroid sparing was reported with olone reduction from 26.8mg/d to 8.6mg/d ( P=0.0047). A significant reduction in physician global assessment of disease activity was also reported reducing from 6.9 to 2 (P= 0.002). Due to the pooled results it is difficult to determine which AOSD sub-group could most benefit. This was a small retrospective questionnaire that relies on the accuracy, availability of data and recall of the physician completing the questions. As anakinra was administered with other drugs it is difficult to ascertain the specific effect of anakinra on disease parameters. In the retrospective case series study by Laskari et.al (2011) with predominantly group 2 patients ( 88% with arthralgias) 16 of the 25 patients received (100mg/day subcutaneously ) in combination with a DMARD (MTX in 13, Leflunomide in 1, cyclophosphamide in 1). 9 patients received anakinra as monotherapy. 21 of the 25 (84%) achieved a complete resolution of disease activity at 12 months , 3 (12%) patients achieved a partial response and 1 s howed no response. At 3 m onths, significant improvement of clinical features ( fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly ) was reported ( ignificant reduction in CRP (mg/dl) from 111mg/dl at baseline to 6mg/dl at month 3 (P=0.028) and ESR from 75 mm/h to 10 mm/h (P=0.04) at 12 month 3 . High ferritin levels (>300ng/ml) were reported in 24 patients at baseline and 4 patients at month 1 (P= 0.004) . There was a r eduction in the number of patients with anaemia (Hb<12 for females and <13.5 for males) from 16 patients at baseline to 5 patients at 3 months (P=0.008). The number of patients with l eucocytosis (>10000/mm3) reduced from 21 patients at baseline to 9 patients at month 1 (P=0.001) . The VAS global score reduced from 2.25 at baseline to 0.3 at month 1 (P<0.001). A s ignificant reduction in methylprednisolone oral dose was reported at month 1 (14 mg/day, P=0.001) and month 3 (8mg/day, P=0.001) compared to baseline (18 mg/day) . This study considered a small mixed cohort of patients and did not differentiate the results for patients treated with anakinra as monotherapy and those who received it as a combination therapy . 2. Is anakinra more effective than comparison therapies ( methotrexate and/or corticosteroids and/or other DMARDs and Canakinumab for group 1 and Etanercept for group 2) in achieving the critical and important outcomes for patients as outlined in the PICO? There were no randomised control trials comparing anakinra with other therapies to provide direct comparison of clinical effectiveness so judgements on relative safety and efficacy will be limited. However the study by Nordstrom et.al (2012) did allow comparison between anakinra and DMARDs. 12 patients were treated with anakinra (100mg subcutaneous injection daily) and 10 were treated with DMARDs (6 on MTX, 2 on azathioprine (AZA), 2 on leflunomide (LEF)). All patients also received prednisolone (10mg/day) and NSAIDs if required. At baseline, patients presented with articular manifestations measured as tender joints (14% in DMARD group and 20% in anak inra group). Normalisation of CRP in both groups was reported by week 8. At week 24, 6 of the 12 patients given anakinra had achieved remission (defined as 8 weeks afebrile in the absence of NSAIDs, decrease in CRP and ferritin to reference limits and norm al joint counts). 2 of the 10 patients on DMARDs achieved remission at the same time point. No statistical testing was reported to quantify this difference. By week 24, 3 patients on anakinra but none in the DMARD group were able to discontinue oral cortic osteroids (P=0.22). More patients on anakinra than on DMARD achieved improvements in the SF36 physical health summary (P=0.011). 3. Is anakinra a cost effective treatment in patients with adult onset Stills disease (Group 1) whose symptoms and biochemical mar kers remain inadequately controlled after treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate? There is no evidence on cost-effectiveness of anakinra and/or comparator therapies in the treatment of refractory Adult-onset Still's disease. 4. Is anakinra more cost effective than comparison therapies? There is no evidence on cost-effectiveness of anakinra and/or comparator therapies in the treatment of refractory Adult-onset Still's disease. 5. Is anakinra a safe treatment for patients with adult onset Stills disease (Group 1) whose symptoms and biochemical markers remain inadequately controlled after treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate? The patient populations in the studies reviewed were in Group 1 and Group 2 and the majority of results presented were pooled. Therefore, it is not possible to define adverse events specific to either AOSD sub -group. 13 In the study by Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al (2015) (n=41), cutaneous reactions were the most common complication (n=8) with 2 patients discontinuing treatment due to the severity of the rash. 2 patients reported urinary tract infections (UTIs), and 1 reported a herpes zoster infection. Two patients discontinued their medication due to severe infections. In the study by Nordstrom et.al (2012) (n=12) 1 patient experienc ed worsening of disease, 7 patients reported grade 1 ISR s and 1 reported a grade 2 ISR. In the study by Giampetro et.al (2013) (n=28), at 23 months 4 patients reported a disease flare and 2 discontinued treatment due to a severe ISR. Lequerre et.al (2008) reported 2 out of 15 patients developing a severe skin rash leading to withdrawal of anakinra. Other side effects reported included singe cases of other infections (for example bronchiti s and uncomplicated hepatitis A ). One patient reported osteonecrosis but this may have been a side effect of long term corticosteroid treatment. In the study by Laskari et.al (2011) (n=25) 3 patients developed a severe urticarial reaction and discontinued therapy , 7 (28%) patients developed infecti ons and 5 developed local hypersensitivity at the injection site. In a review on tolerance and efficacy of off-label anti -interleukin-1 treatments in Fran ce, Rossi -Semerano et. al. (2015) reported serious adverse events in 3 patients treated with anakinra for AOSD. One patient developed pneumonia, one developed a varicella zoster infection and one developed macrophage activation syndrome. In a review of five studies by Hong et. al. (2014), a severe urticarial reaction was the most common adverse event recorded which led to withdrawal of anakinra in some cases . Ahme d et al. (2015) have published a case report of anakinra associated hepatotoxicity in a 46 year old woman which resolved after discontinuation. Aly et.al (2013) also reported subacute liver failure associated with anakinra treatment for AOSD . Meyer et.al. (2012) repor ted acute hepatitis in 3 female patients with AOSD with normalisation of liver enzymes after withdrawal of anakinra. A case report by Taylor et. al. (2016) reported a case of an adolesc ent mal e with AOSD with acute liver failure which developed shortly after initiation of anakinra and improved after withdrawal of the drug. There was insufficient clinical information in these studies to ascertain whether these patients were receiving anakinra for refractory AOSD . Pregnancy The license for anakinra states that there is limited data on the use of anakinra in pregnant women (EMEA). Reproductive studies on rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus. There is limited anecdotal experience on the use of anakinra in pregnancy. The license states that anakinra is not recommended for use during pregnancy, while breast feeding and in women of child bearing age not using contraception. The guideline published by Flint et. al. (2016) states that there is limited evidence on which to base a recommendation relating to the use of anakinra in pregnancy , during breastfeeding or related to paternal exposure but suggests that unintentional exposure in the first trimester is unlikely to be harmful . 14 Tocilizumab 4 papers evaluating tocilizumab in refractory AOSD were included in this review. These include a case series by Cipriani et. al. (2014), a retrospective multi -centre open label study by O rtiz-Sanjuan et. al. (2014), a prospective cohort study by Puechal et.al. (2011) and a retrospective questionnaire based survey study by Elkayam et.al . (2014) . There were no systematic review s or single or double bl ind trials identified comparing the effect of tocilizumab with comparator therapies. 1. Is tocilizumab a clinically effective treatment in patients with adult onset Stills disease (Group 1) whose symptoms and biochemical markers remain inadequately controlled after treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate and anakinra? In the studies reviewed, the patient cohort includes patients with systemic (Group 1) and articular disease (Group 2). No studies directly reported the effect of tocilizumab exclusively in patients with systemic type AOSD (Group 1) refractory to corticosteroids, MTX and anakinra. As many of the results presented were pooled it is not possible to ascertain which group will most benefit from the use of tocilizumab. 2. Is tocilizumab a clinicall y effective treatment in patients with adult onset Stills disease (Group 2) whose symptoms and biochemical markers remain inadequately controlled after treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate? In the case series by Cipriani et.al (2014), 11 patients were treated with tocilizumab (8mg/kg every 4 weeks for 12 months ). 8 of these patients received tocil izumab in combination with MTX and pred nisolo ne and 3 patients received tocilizumab with prednisolo ne without MTX. All patients had chronic arthr itis (Group 2). There was a reduction in median disease activity score in 28 joints - reducing from 5.62 at baseline to 1.61 at month 12. EULAR remission was observed in 45.45% (5/11) of patients at 3 months and in 81% (9/11) at 12 months. Remission of fev er and systemic symptoms was reported in all patients , however no statistical testing was reported. A statisti cally significant improvement in joint assessment was reported after 6 months and 12 months of treatment compared to baseline (P<0.05). Reduction in ESR, CRP and ferritin values was reported at month 3 and remained stable at month 12. There was also improvement in haemoglobin levels at month 12 in 4 patients but no statistical testing was reported. A significant improvement in median patient VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) score was reported, reducing from 75 at baseline to 0 at month 12 (P=<0.005). Pred nisolone was tapered from baseline 50mg/day to 6.25mg/day at month 6 with 8 of the 11 patients (72%) discontinuing corticosteroid therapy after 12 months . This small case series (n=11) does not allow estimation of the precise effects of tocilizumab as monotherapy as all patients received the drug in combination. In the retr ospective multi -centre open labe l study by Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al (2014) 34 patients were treated with tocilizumab (8mg/kg) but in variable doses and frequencies (every 4 weeks (n=22), every 2 weeks (n=10) and 4mg/kg every 4 weeks (n=2) ). 15 patients received tocilizumab as monotherapy and 19 in combination with MTX. Patients were predominantly diagnosed with Group 2 AOSD. After 1 year, the prevalence of joint manifestations in the patient group decreased from 97.1% to 32.4%. There was also a reduction in the prevalence of fever (from 78% to 22%), ly mphadenopathy (from 29.4% to 0%) and rapid improvement of other systemic symptoms such as cutaneous 15 manifestations . No stati stical testing was reported for these parameters . 32.4% patients still had persistent joint involvement after 1 year of tocilizumab therapy. Reduction in ESR, CRP, ferritin levels, leucocytosis and anaemia was reported but did not reach statistical significance . A significant steroid sparing effect (P<0.05) was reported with median prednisolone reducing from 13.8mg/day at baseline to 2.5mg/day at 1 year . However the specific effect of tocilizumab as monotherapy cannot be asc ertained as the drug was given as a combination therapy. There may be a greater clinical effect on joint manifestations of AOSD compared to systemic manifestations, but this is based on a small num ber of patients (n=34). In a prospective cohort study by Puechal et.al (2011) 14 patients with AOS D received tocilizumab at different doses and frequencies ((n=9) 8mg/kg every 4 weeks, 8mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=4) and 5mg/kg monthly (n=1)) . Tocilizumab was given in combination with other drugs MTX, (n=2) LEF). 4 patients received tocilizumab monotherapy . 8 of the 11 patients had the chronic arthritic form of the disease . Of the 11 patients who successfully completed treatment in this 6 month study, resolution of systemic symptoms (fever and eruption) was observed in 6 patients . Reduction in mean DAS28, good EULAR response (n=9) and EULAR remission (n=8) at 6 months were also reported. Reduction in median ESR (from 36.5mm/h to 12.5 at month 6), CRP (fro m 5.2 at baseline to 0.6 at month 6), serum ferritin (from 1939ng/ml to 209 at month 6) and leucocyte count (from 10.65 at baseline to 9.03 at month 6) were reported but with no statistical significance reported. Prednisolo ne dosage reduced to a mean of 13mg/day at 3 months to 10.3mg/day at 6 months, however no correlation was found between the tocilizumab dose and achievement of arthritis or systemic remission or with the decrease of corticosteroids. In the retrospective questionnaire based survey study by Elkayam et.al (2014) (n=15) all patients had arthralgia with fever and/or rash. Patients received varying doses and frequencies of tocilizumab (n=12 patients received tocilizumab 8mg/kg/month, n=3 received 8mg/kg twice a month). After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in mean tender joints (P<0.05) reported with resolution of systemic symptoms in 86% patients after 6 months of treatment. EULAR response was 57% after 6 months with a reported regre ssion of amyloidosis. M ean ESR reduced from 60mm/h to 3.9, CRP reduced from 11.6 to 0.5 (P<0.05) and significant steroid sparing was reported (P<0.05) with mean prednisolo ne dose reduced from 27.6mg/d to 4.9mg/d. This study is a retrospective survey with limitations around data completeness as some of the rheumatologists surveyed had incomplete treatment histories for their patients. 3. Is tocilizumab more effective than comparison therapies in achieving the critical and important outcomes for patients as detailed in the PICO form ? There were no head to head comparison or single or double blind trials comparing tocilizumab with other therapies , therefore it is difficult to a make direct comparison of clinical effectiveness compared to standard therapy . 4. Is tocilizumab a cost effective treatment in patients with adult onset Stills disease (Group 1) whose symptoms and biochemical markers remain inadequately controlled after treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate and anakinra? There wer e no studies identified that provided information on the cost effectiveness of tocilizumab in the treatment of refractory Adult-onset Still's disease (Group 1) . 16 5. Is tocilizumab a cost effective treatment in patients with adult onset Stills disease (Group 2) w hose symptoms and biochemical markers remain inadequately controlled after treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate? There wer e no studies identified that provided information on the cost effectiveness of tocilizumab in the treatment of refractory Adult-onset Still's disease (Group 2) . 6. Is tocilizumab more cost effective than com parison therapies? There wer e no studies identified that evaluated the cost effectiveness of tocilizumab compared to comparison therapies in the treatment of refractory Adult-onset Still's disease. 7. Is tocilizumab a safe treatment for patients with adult onset Stills disease (Group 1) whose symptoms and biochemical markers remain inadequately controlled after treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate and anakinra? The patient populations in the studies consisted of patients with AOSD who had systemic and chronic articular manifestations of the disease. Therefore it is not possible to define adverse events specific to either AOSD sub-group. 8. Is tocilizumab a safe treatment for patients with adult onset Stills disease (Group 2) whose symptoms and biochemical markers remain inadequately controlled after treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate? Tocilizumab is licensed by the European Medicines Agency to treat rheumatoid arthritis and the most common side effects are reported as upper respiratory tract infections, hypertension and abnormal liver function tests. Serious potential side effects incl ude infections, diverticulitis and hypersensitivity. The adverse events associated with the use of tocilizumab in refractory AOSD include In the study by Cipriani et.a l. (2014) 3 out of 11 patients (Group 2) experienced adverse events such as tender and swollen joints, onset of systemic symptoms and a worsening of patient VAS global health score with high ESR, CRP and ferritin. Minor adverse events reported include one upper respiratory tract infect ion (URTI ) and 2 ISRs after one infusion. In the study by Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al. (2014), after a median follow up of 19 months, 10 out of 34 patients experienced a range of infections (1 pyelonephr itis and acute enterocolitis, 1 bacterial spondylodiscitis, 1 pneumonia, 3 URTI, 1 dental infection, 1 urinary infection, 1 Epstein-Barr infection and 1 herpes zoster infection). 2 patients had infections that lead to discontinuation of treatment. Puechal et. al. (2011 ) (n=14) 17 described adverse events that included necrotising angiodermatitis (n=1), chest pain (n=1) and ongoing episodes of high fever (n=1) . In a case report by Drepper et. al. (2013), tocilizumab induced liver injury was reported 19 months after initial tocilizumab exposure as a rare event in an 18 year old patient. In another case report by Tsurukawa et.al. (2016), a herpes zoster infection occurred five days after an infusion in a 56 year old patient however the patient was also on immunosuppressive therapy so this may be a case of an atypical opportunistic infection. In these two case reports there is insufficient clinical detail to ascertain if the patients had refractory AOSD . Pregnancy and breast feeding The license information states that there is not adequate data for the use of tocilizumab in pregnant women and studies in animals have shown an increased risk of spontaneous abortion/foetal death. It is also not known if tocilizumab is excreted in human breast milk. Women of child bearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment. A review by Calligaro et. al. (2014) on safety of biological drugs in pregnancy recommended that tocilizumab is discontinued at least 3 months prior to conception. This review reported on two case series (n = 39 outcomes of pregnancies exposed to tocilizumab) with 41% live births, 20.5% spontaneous abortion and 33.3% elective terminations. 9. What is the incidence of adult onset Stills disease overall and Groups 1 and 2 in the English population? There is no consensus on the incidence and prevalence of AOSD. Fautrel et al (2004) states the estimated incidence of AOSD in France is between 1 - 2 cases per million population per year. Therefore, it can be estimated that i n England, approximately 55- 110 new cases of Adult-onset Still's disease could be expected every year. This makes assumptions about the similarities of the French and English populations. There is insufficient epidemiological information to make estimates of incidence for each AOSD sub-group. 10. What is the prevalence of adult onset Stills disease overall and Groups 1 and 2 in the English population? Fautrel (2004) reports the prevalence of adult-onset Still's disease at around 10 per million (range 7.3 to 14.7) in Japan. Asanuma et.al (2015) estimated the prevalence of adult-onset Still's disease at 3.9 per 100,000 in a Japanese study . Based on extrapolated estimates for England, approximately 600-800 cases of a dult-onset Still's disease could be estimated to be prevalent in the population. Applying this epidemiology should be interpreted with caution given the significant differences in the ethnic and age profiles between the Japanese and English populations. There is insufficient epidemiological information to make estimates of prevalence for each AOSD sub-group. 18 Discussion The evidence search identified a total of 320 abstracts relevant to the topic that were reviewed. 92 papers were extracted for further review and 9 papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria to address the research questions in the PICO, were selected for inclusion (5 for anakinra and 4 for tocilizumab) which are summarised in this review. The studies selected for inclusion in this review were assessed on the basis of the criteria and research questions included in the PICO . The majority of the studies i ncluded are retrospective case series which were not controlled and were not randomised. They included small numbers of patients. Due to the nature of the study design the evidence is of poor to moderate quality. Most studies did not directly compare anaki nra or tocilizumab with standard therapy so judgements on relative efficacy and safety will be limited. The baseline characteristics of patients differed in terms of AOSD sub-group, previous treatment and severity of symptoms. The length of follow up als o varied. The studies with shorter follow up may not have had sufficient time to record the medium and longer term effects of the drugs or their side effects. In the majority of studies , the anakinra or tocilizumab was administered in combination with other drugs with only a minority of patients receiving it as a monotherapy. Most studies analysed these patients together and therefore outcomes could not be split by baseline characteristics, AOSD sub -group or treatment type. For patients on combination therapy it is difficult to ascertain the specific effect of tocilizumab or anakinra. Patients treated with anakinra and tocilizumab appeared to show some efficacy in relief of systemic features of the disease. There was a lesser effect on the articular mani festations of AOSD. Patients treated with the drugs also reported significant steroid sparing and improvement in biochemical markers and VAS scores. Many studies did not undertake statistical testing to describe the impact of the changes observed. Therefore the degree of effectiveness cannot be reliably quantified using the available evidence. Significant adverse events have been reported with use of anakinra and tocilizumab which has led to discontinuation of treatment in some patients . 19 5. Conclusion The published evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of both anakinra and tocilizumab in AOSD consists of case series, retrospective studies , a randomised open label study and a prospective cohort study . These studies are of variable quality. The major drawback of these studies is that they are subject to selection bias and the effect of confounding factors so it is difficult to understand the true efficacy of the intervention. The evidence suggests that both anakinra and tocilizumab are associated with a positive impact on biochemical markers, systemic features and use of steroids in patients with refractory AOSD . However as both drugs were administered as both monotherapy and combination therapy their exact effect cannot be ascertained. As patients received different drugs in combination with anakinra and tocilizumab it is not possible to make clear recommendations on which drugs could be given in combination or at which stage of disease progress ion. Patients who received the drug were from Group 1 and 2 but pooled results were presented so it is not clear which group would most benefit from the therapy. Adverse events were reported relatively frequently and ranged from injection site reactions to severe infections . The lack of randomised controlled trials may be due to the rarity of the disease and heterogeneous presentations which means it is difficult to make direct comparisons with standard care. No studies have evaluated the cost -effectiveness of either drug or compared its cost effectiveness with existing treatments. 20 6.

Clinical improvement followed after anakinra discontinuation 7 Directly applicable but note small cohort size Due to the refractory nature of the disease the prior history of treatment in all patients is limited. There may be an absence of data on potential confounding factors. It is not possibl e to determine the specific effects of anakinra as monotherapy since anakinra was prescribed in combination with other drugs and pooled results are presented for the entire patient cohort. Patients were predominantly Group 2 type but as ther e was no sub- group analysis the effect of anakinra on different groups of AOSD cannot be determined. Patients are followed up to 1 year so long term efficacy and safety cannot be ascertained from the findings. Results do not include statistical significance except for the steroid sparing effects [P<0.05] and there is no information on cost- effectiveness or physician's global assessment which limits the interpretation of findings . 21 manifestatio n 87.8%, fever 78%, cutaneous rash 58.5% up = 16 months Concomitant Rx with anakinra at baseline = Corticosteroids Primary outcome - clinical effectiveness Primary outcome - clinical effectiveness Secondar y outcome - Normalisation/improve ment of ESR and/or CRP and/or ferritin --- Normalisation/improve ment of anaemia and leucocytosis -- Dosage of prednisolone and DMARDs Adherence to treatment -6(14.6%) with mild local cutaneous reactions in the site of anakinra inj ection -Severe = Mild leukopenia =3, Myopathy with elevation of muscle enzymes=1 Frequency of abnormal elevation of CRP down - 90.2% 65.9% to 14.6%Anaemia to 9.8% anakinra steroid sparing effects (P=<0.05) from median Prednisolone 20mg/day at baseline to 5mg at 1 year After 1 year 14 pts (34%) discontinued biologic agent because of remission 22 (1), side effects (n=5), lack of efficacy (n=7), desire to become pregnant (m=1) Giam petro et.al. 2013 Retrospect ive study (Data collected using a standardised questionn aire) Groups 1 & 2 28 Adult - onset Still's disease patients (diagnosed using Yamaguchi criteria) from 9 different rheumatolog y or int medicine depts.

Confounding bias is more common in retrospective studies as interpretation is based on available information. In this study, the results are not tested for statistical significance. The s pecific impact on the two types of AOSD cannot be determined as results are pooled. The patient cohort is small and follow up is restricted to 23 month s which may limit the generalisability of findings and understanding of long term efficacy and safety of treatment with anakinra in refractory AOSD patients . Effects of anakinra as monotherapy cannot be ascertained as it is used in combination with MTX and the results are pooled for the entire cohort. Overall anakinra dose tapering or discontinuation is seen to be associated with relapse in half of the patients suggesting continued long term administration may be required to sustain effects on clinical and biochemical markers. 23 age - 40.3 years (range 23-72 years) Mean SD disease duration - 9.3 years (range 1- 22 yrs) Ratio of Men to women 1:2 (M -9, F- 19) 13 patients - Predominantly articular disease and systemic in others. al l patients refractory to conventional therapy - NSAIDs, CTX, DMARDs. 14 failed other biologic agents (11 Etanercept, 9 infliximab, 3 adalimumab and 2 rituximab) Previous therapeutic failure - Prednisolonprednisolone or equival ent Primary outcome - clinical effectiven ess Secondar y outcome Secondar y outcome Normalisation/improve ment of ESR and/or CRP and/or ferritin - Normalisation/improve of anaemia and leucocytosis Dosage of prednisolone and DMARDs Adherence to treatment of injection despite a significant response of Adult- onset Still's disease.

The results for adult -onset Still's disease patients (n=15) treated with anakinra are provided separately. It is difficult to assess the effects of anakinra as monotherapy as it is used in combination with MTX or an other DMARD in 11 patients. Effects of anakinra on patients with predominantly systemic (Group1) disease and those with chronic articular manifestations along with systemic features (Group 2) cannot be ascertained as the results are pooled for the entire cohort of 15 patients. The results show significant steroi d sparing (P=0.0047) in patients after administering anakinra with significant improvement in biochemical markers (ESR P=0.0005, CRP P=0.001) and reduction in mean tender and swollen joints (P=0.0002 and P=0.0005].

At 3 months significant 6 Directly applicable but note limitations and small cohort size This retrospective case series study of 25 patients is limited by having to rely on patient data available from medical records with incomplete information on drugs used before initiating therapy with anakinra. This may lead to confounding bias while interpreting results. The study includes a small cohort of patients and more than a third of patients had a follow up of less than a year which may not give time to ascertain the medium and long term efficacy or safety of the drug. The study states that a median of only 6 patients (5- 8) fulfilled Yamaguchi criteria. The refractory status of patients is based on resistance to corticosteroids, DMARD or TNF inhibitors, so it is not possible to establish if all patients were refractory to corticosteroids and MTX before commencing anakinra. While this study does not present the results separately for patients with anakinra as monotherapy or combined with a DMARD, this is the 28 physician contacting patient to estimate exact time points of partial and complete response and relapse. Median disease duration - 7 months (1- 228) Medi cipran No. of Yamaguchi disease criteria fulfilled at baseline was 6 (5- 8) Resistant to corticosteroi ds (n=17), DMARDs (n=4), or TNFa inhibitors (n=4) Complete response was defined as the complete resolution of all disease- related symptoms, except for joint erosion medication included MTX in 13 patients - median dose 12.5 (7.5 - 20)mg/week, leflunomide at low dose (10mg/day) in one patient and cyclosporine A at 3mg/day in 1 patients. MTX given during follow up in 10 of 13 patients. In 3 patients MTX discontinued 8, 5 and 5 months after remission.

However it is difficult to establish whether use of a DMARD with anakinra improves its efficacy in all patients.

During the open label extension (OLE) phase of 28 weeks, majority of patients receiving anakinra completed 52 weeks vs. only 3 patients on DMARD. Half of patients randomised to 6 Applicable This is an open, randomised, multi -centre study on 22 patients from 10 centres in Finl and, Norway and Sweden with refractory AOSD randomised into two groups. The small cohort does not allow statistical testing between groups. Overall, the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Precise effects of anakinra on refractory AOSD cannot be determined as it is used in combination with steroids and NSAIDs. This is the only study that offers comparative information of effects from use of anakinra versus DMARDs through randomisation.

Tocilizumab has been used in varying doses and in combination with MTX(8), LEF(2) and as monotherapy and results are pooled for the entire cohort making it difficult to ascertain the specific efficacy of Tocilizumab as a monotherapy in steroid and MTX refractory AOSD. The history of medications used previously included Anakinra however it is difficult to establish if tocilizumab treatment was superior to Anakinra as no previous history is available and this is not a head to head comparison. As it is a retrospective study previous drug history is limited to the data that is available and not all the r esults on the outcomes listed in the PICO are available.

(2014) 5 Applicable but note small numbers B A response to treatment can be measured as resolution of disease flares and clinical remission. Ortiz - Sanjuan et.al (2014), reported at 1 year that cutaneous manifestations and fever reduced from 58.8% to 5.9%, lymphadenopathy from 29.4% to 0% but joint manifestatio ns were refractory to treatment compared to systemic manifestations with 32.4% patients having persistent joint involvement after 1 year of therapy This is a multi- centre open label observational retrospective study with a small cohort of patients some of whom received tocilizumab as monotherapy and some in combination. This aspect of the study design makes it difficult to ascertain the specific effect of tocilizumab There is also limited scope for generalisability due to the lack of a comparator .

Puechal et. al. (2011) 5 Directly applicable but combination therapies used 52 This case series study included only 11 patients limiting its generalisability and used tocilizumab in both mono - and combination therapy making specific effects difficult to ascertain. Data on outcomes related to quality of life, subjective symptom scores and cost effectiveness are unavailable. Results cannot be split to determine the specific effects of tocilizumab on the two AOSD group types Adverse treatment effects Cipriani et. al. (2014) 5 Applicable but note small numbers B Adverse effects of the treatment ranges from localised rashes at injection site to system ic or articular disease flares to severe infections which can even lead to discontinuation of treatment. Ortiz - Sanjuan et.al (2014) reported that infections were common at 19 months follow up. This mu lti- centre open label observational retrospective study reported on a small patient cohort with tocilizumab used as both monotherapy and in combination. This makes it difficult to ascertain the specific effect of the drug. There was no comparator group in the study. Ortiz -Sanjuan et. al.

Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al (2014) report ed reduction of ESR from 79.4% to 2.9%, reduction of CRP from 82.4% 23% high serum ferritin levels reduced from 47.1% to 2.9%. This is a multi- centre open label observational retrospective study reported on a small number of patients. There is limited scope for generalisability due to the lack of a comparator and the small cohort size and the results available do not address all the outcomes listed in the PICO .

(2014) 5 Applicable but note small numbers B Anaemia, hyperferritinaemia and leucocytosis are commonly observed in adult -onset Still's disease. Ortiz -Sanjuan et.al (2014) reported from 44.1% to 2.9% . This multi- centre open label observational retrospective study reported on a small number of patients on tocilizumab as monotherapy and in combination. The nature of the study leaves considerable scope for bias in reporting outcomes. Ortiz -Sanjuan et. al. (2014) 7 Directly applicable but combination therapies used Puechal et. al. (2011) 5 Directly applicable but combination therapies used 54 Dosage of prednisolone and DMARDs Cipriani et. al. (2014) 5 Applicable but note small numbers B Prolonged use of corticosteroids especially in high doses can cause several unwanted side effects . Cipriani et.al (2014) reported prednisolone was tapered from the baseline median dose of 50mg/day to 12.5mg/day at month 3 and after 12 months 8/11 patients discontinued corticosteroid therapy. However this case series refers to a very small number of patients with the drug used as both monotherapy and in combination. Case series do not take account of confounding factors and in the study tocilizumab is used as both monotherapy and in combination. Ortiz -Sanjuan et. al.

(2014) 5 Applicable but has limitations and small cohort of patients Physician global assessment of disease activity (PGA) Cipriani et. al. (2014) 5 Applicable but note small numbers C PGA is a recognised tool to monitor health improvement and measure and track patient outcomes. Cipriani et.al (2014) report ed median patient VAS baseline of 75 reducing to 35 at month 6 and 0 at 1 year post therapy with statistically significant improvement (P<0.005). This case series reported on a very small number of patients with the dr ug being used as both monotherapy and in combination. 55 Subjective symptom scores Puechal et. al. (2011) 5 Directly applicable but combination therapies used C The SF-36 is a validated tool to measure patient's quality of life. Puechal et.al (2011) report ed 60% improvement in the number of tender joint s, swollen joints and mean visual assessment score for patients' global health. This prospective cohort study included a very small number of patients and there was no control group and no randomisation. Tocilizumab was used as both single therapy and in combination and at differing doses making it challenging to ascertain the distinct effect of the drug and the optimal dose/frequency. . Adherence to treatment Cipriani et. al. (2014) 5 Applicable but note small numbers C Cipriani et.al (2014) report ed all 11 patients successfully completed treatment with tocilizumab. 72% patients (8/11) maintained clinical remission on only methotrexate. However this is an extremely small case series and therefore has limited generalisability. 56 8. Factsheet Intervention Fact Sheet What is the intervention for? Adult onset Stills disease Who might consider taking it? Patients with Adult -onset Still's disease who have shown partial or incomplete remission of their disease after taking corticosteroids and methotrexate Who should not take it? Patients who are pregnant, those who have significan t infections or risk of infection should not take these therapies . Other things to consider Published studies showing clinical effectiveness and safety of these interventions are based on small cohort s of patients and few of the results obtained are statistically significant. Clinical efficacy of a nakinra and t ocilizumab as monotherapy in refractory adult-onset Still's disease could not be determined exclusively as both drugs were used in combination with other drugs in majority of patients . It was not possible to determine which sub -group could most benefit from the use of the drug. Benefits of the intervention Both anakinra and tocilizu mab have shown potential clinical effectiveness in patients with adult-onset Still's disease by improving systemic features such as fever, skin rash, enlargement of organs such as spleen or liver, as well as haematological and serological markers ( assessed through blood tests) which are caused by inflammation. Improvement in the articular features - such as joint pai n and/or swelling - has been less significant compared to the improvement in systemic signs and symptoms . Studies have reported variable evidence on the impact of the drugs on outcomes such as disease activity scores or EULAR remission, subjective symptom scores and Physician's global assessment tools - which are recognised measures of disease activity . Some studies also demonstrated that patients required lower doses of steroids sparing after introduction of these drugs. However this w as often in combination with other drugs. 57 Harms of the intervention Adverse events associated with use of anakinra included localised skin reactions ( ranging from mild to severe) at the injection site and infections. In some patients this has led to discontinuati on of treatment. Other side effects include liver functi on abnormalities, reduced numbers of white blood cells and increased disease activity (systemic or arthritic flares ). Adverse events associated with Tocilizumab include infections , low white blood cells, liver inflammation and systemic or arthritic flare . Injection site reactions are also common and can be severe. 58 9.
