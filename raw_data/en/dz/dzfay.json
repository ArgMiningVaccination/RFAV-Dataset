Fluzone High -Dose Vaccine Fluzone High -Dose vaccine is an inactivated influenza virus vaccine indicated for active immunization of persons 65 years of age and older against influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and type B contained in the vaccine. Approval of Fluzone High -Dose vaccine is based on superior immune response relative to Fluzone vaccine. Data demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Fluzone High -Dose vaccine relative to Fluzone vaccine have not yet been reviewed by FDA. 185/13/2014 10 Fluzone and Fluzone High -Dose Vaccines: Important Safety Information (2) Safety Information Fluzone and Fluzone High -Dose Vaccines The most common local and systemic adverse reactions to Fluzone and Fluzone High - Dose vaccines include pain, erythema, and swelling at the vaccination site ; fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia. Other adverse reactions may occur. Fluzone and Fluzone High -Dose vaccines should not be administered to anyone with a severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any vaccine component, including egg protein or thimerosal (the multi -dose vial of Fluzone vaccine is the only presentation that contains thimerosal), or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. The decision to give Fluzone or Fluzone High -Dose vaccine should be based on the potential benefits and risks, especially if Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior influenza vaccine. Vaccination with Fluzone or Fluzone High-Dose vaccine may not protect all individuals.
