Crystals. Some think they're powerful, others think they're just pretty objects to wear around their necks - either way, there's no denying that they've been a real hit over the past few years. I was never a great believer in crystals. But to be honest, I didn't really know much about them. It was only when I hit a rough patch in life - when I was willing to try anything to help my mindset - that it even crossed my mind to give them a go. Reading all about their calming, protective and positivity-inducing qualities online, I thought it was probably about time I took the plunge and invested in some. Call it the placebo effect or not - I like them, and I'm a total convert. In fact, you'll never see me without one now, whether it be embedded in my jewellery, floating around in my handbag or sitting pretty on my bedside table. It's just nice knowing that they could possibly be helping my mindset - or, at worst, just looking beautiful on display. As a beauty enthusiast, I spend a lot of my time trialling skincare products - from the very affordable to the extremely luxurious. But, recently, I've noticed a trend. Products were landing on my desk that were infused with crystals, which promised a seamless glow and countless beauty benefits - needless to say, I jumped on the hype. Here are some that I tried and truly loved. So much so, they're now staples in my skincare routine, and some I even save for best when I'm treating myself to an extended DIY pamper session. And, as a beauty editor, that says something! Bybi Crystal Clear Cleanser, \u00a324, Sephora UK. A cleanser with a difference. Packed with rock quartz crystals and a blend of potent natural ingredients, this prebiotic formula leaves skin fresh and squeaky clean without causing any sensitivity or harm to your skin's natural moisture barrier. I swear, this is the only cleanser I've ever used that can single handedly give me a lit-from-within glow.
