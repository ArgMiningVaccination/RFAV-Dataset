If you're enrolling with us in the fall of 2010, you'll like ly be transitioning with Ogeechee Technical College and the entire Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) as we convert to a semester calendar, beginning in August 2011. You're probably already familiar with the semester calendar, so it won't be something new to you. It's a great move for our system and our students as we align with most of other colleges and universities in Georgia and across the country. Why semesters? The semester system offers many advantages to our students. The new academic calendar will: Align our calendar with 80 percent of other colleg es and universities, and even with the K-12 system; Make it easier to transfer to other colleges and universities; Increase instructional time for mastery of course material; Improve scheduling for jo int and dual enrollment high school students; and Provide more time for learning experi ences like clinical and internships. How will this change affect students? If you will graduate before August 2011, you will not be affected by the change to semesters. If you enroll in 2010 and will not graduate before August 20 11, you'll begin on the quarter system and will make the change to semesters. Beginning in July 2010 and contin uing throughout the year, college advisors will be working with transitional students to ensure a smooth conversion. You should plan to meet with your advisor to review the credit conversion schedule and receive a personal academic plan to complete your program under semesters. Our Student Commitment The technical college system is committed to serving and educating our students at the highest level of excellence. The conversion from quarters to semesters is a change that reflects our goal to provide students with seamless education in Georgia and the most advanced traini ng, education and workforce preparation possible. The guiding principle of the semester conversion process is that every effort will be made to see that each student will be successfully transitioned with as minimal disrup tion as possible to his or her coursework during the changeover. To support this commitment, each TCSG transitional student will have a pers onal advising session to guide them through the conversion. At that meeting, each student will receive a semester crosswalk guide and an academic plan for their program under semesters. How should students prepare? If you'll be making the change from quarters to semester s, you'll have a personal advising session to create an academic plan that will guide you through the semester tran sition. Contact your adviser to schedule your meeting. For more information To learn more about the quarter to semester conversion, ta lk with your advisor or log on to www.ogeecheetech.edu or www.TCSGSemester411.com. 8 GENERAL INFORMATION HISTORY OF OGEECHEE TECHNICAL COLLEGE ......................................................................................... ............. 8 MISSION ST ATEMEN ...................................... 9 11 COLLEGE ....................................... 12 History of Ogeechee Technical College The General Assembly approved the establishment of Ogeechee Technical Institute (OTI) as a public, two-year technical institute under the supervision of the Departme nt of Technical and Adult Education (DTAE) in 1986. Groundbreaking for the campus occurred two years later, and during the following year, Ogeechee Tech began offering its first credit program, Prac tical Nursing, with 25 students enrolled. Ogeechee Tech assumed the responsibi lity for offering Adult Literacy pr ograms and administering the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) examination in 1989. Faculty and staff moved into the new 75,000 square foot, $6 million state-of-the-art facility Fall of 1990, and additi onal program offerings began Spring Quarter 1991. Ogeechee Tech graduated its first class of nine Practi cal Nursing students in December of 1990. The opening of Ogeechee coincided with the expansive growth of Georgia Southern University and the Statesboro area. In addition, the establishment of the Georgia State Lottery funded Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) financial aid program in 1993 was a contributing factor in the unprecedented growth of Ogeechee Tech. Ogeechee Tech experienced a $5.5 million expansion by adding three buildings\u2014a Health Sciences Building, a Child Enrichment Center, and a Horticulture Bu ilding in 1999. During this time, Ogeec hee Tech also increased its services through the opening of the Screven Co unty Learning Center in Sylvania. Ogeechee Tech offered its first Associ ate of Applied Technology (AAT) degree program in Industrial Manufacturing Technology Winter Quarter 2000, with eight students en rolled, and in the following academic year offered AAT degrees in Accounting, Computer Information Systems, Early Childhood Care and Ed ucation, Funeral Service Education, Health Information Technology, Healthcare Management Technology, Marketing Management, Opticianry, and Secretarial Science. House Bill 1187, known as the A + Education Reform Act, en acted in 2000, changed the na mes of technical institutes in Georgia to technical colleges. On Ju ly 6th of that year, Ogeechee Technica l Institute officially became Ogeechee Technical College. Ogeechee Tech awarded its first AAT degree in December 2000 in Early Childhood Care and Education. During the summer of 2002, Ogeechee Tech opened the Evans County Learning Center. 9 Student growth continued at Ogeechee Tech due largely to the addition of new programs, many of which are unique to DTAE, the state, and the region. These distinctive programs included certificate, diploma, and degrees in technical areas such as Funeral Service Education, Fo rensic Science Technology, and Opticianry. With the opening of the Occupational Studies Building in Fall 2003, a wider variety of programs, such as Agribusiness, Wildlife and Plantation Management, Geog raphical Information Systems Technology, Veterinary Technology, Culinary Arts, and Hotel, Restaurant and To urism Management, enabled the college to further expand its offerings. In 2004, Ogeechee Tech paid tribute to the late Senator Joseph E. Kennedy for his role in the establishment of Ogeechee Technical Institute by dedica ting the main building on campus as the Joseph E. Kennedy Building. On May 13, 2008, Governor Sonny Perdue signed legislation that officially changed the name of the Department of Technical and Adult Education. Effective July 1, 2008, the system became known as the Technical College System of Georgia. Governor Perdue also served as the keynote speaker for the 2008 Spring Commencement at Ogeechee Technical College. Shortly thereafter, Laura \"Molly\" Bickerton, a student in the College's Radiologic Technology program, was selected as Georgia's technical college Studen t of the Year in the 37th annual Georgia Occupational Award of Leadership (GOAL) competition. In July of 2008, Ogeechee Technical College was awarded a regional law enforcement academy. The project, which involves five other technical colleges, allows new law en forcement officers to receive their basic law enforcement training at a state technical college and obtain college credit at the same time. In an effort to continually grow and expand, in August of 2008, Ogeechee Technical College began construction of the Evans Technical Education complex in Hagan, Georgia. Ogeechee Tech was established to develop the existing and future workforce needs of the communities of Bulloch, Evans, Screven, and surrounding counties. As a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia, Ogeechee Tech continues to exist as a key player in the economic development of these communities. Mission Statement Ogeechee Technical College, a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia, is a public institution of higher learning that contributes to economic, educational, and community development by providing quality technical education and services, adult literacy education, contin uing education, and custom ized business and industry workforce training to the citizens of the communities it serves. Vision Statement Ogeechee Technical College will serve as a catalyst for economic prosperity in the region by providing a student- centered environment to prepare lifelong learners to succeed in a global society. State Standards Ogeechee Technical College ad heres to statewide institutional and program curriculum standards established by the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG). These standards serve as a benchmark for providing high quality technical training, which meets the demands of business an d industry. TCSG standards ensure that our partners in business and industry can rely on our students to have the knowledge and technical expertise to handle their jobs efficiently.

The President may waive the \"16 years of age\" requirement for secondary students who are participating in an articulated program of study. Required Academic Criteria A GED or high school diploma (verified by an official transcript including graduation date and diploma type) will be required for admission to Ogeechee Technical College unless otherwise specified by the program's standards. Certificates of Attendance or special education diplomas are not recognized for admission purposes. Students with diplomas from secondary schools located outside the Unit ed States must have their transcripts evaluated for equivalency by an approved outside evaluation organization (suggested agencies are available through the Admissions Office). Applicants who have successfully completed (C or better) a minimum of 30 semester or 45 quarter hours at the degree level may submit official transc ripts from all previously attended colleges accredited by an accepted accrediting agency in lieu of a GED or high school diploma. In order to be accepted by a Technical College, the applic ant must have been awarded a high school diploma from a secondary school that is accredited by a regional accredit ing agency such as the Southe rn Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement, the Georgia Accrediting Commission, the Georgia Association of Christian Schools, the Association of Chri stian Schools International, the Georgia Private School Accreditation Council, the Accredit ing Commission for Independent Study, the Southern Association of Independent Schools, the Florida Counci l of Independent Schools and the Distan ce Education Training Council; or from a public school regulated by a school system and state department of education.

Assessment The ability of a student to succeed in a program at Ogee chee Technical College is greatly determined by the math and language skills possessed by that student. Ogeechee Te ch is committed to assisting each student to achieve at their maximum potential. All students applying for diploma, degr ee, and certificate programs must be assessed prior to acceptance to a program of study. Students will th en be admitted in accordance with the academic standards applicable to that program. Ogeechee Tech utilizes COMPASS or ASSET, the TCSG-approved assessment instruments, when evaluating students for program readiness. However, in the place of COMPASS or ASSET, Ogeechee Tech may accept a student's official entrance score on a validated assessment instrument (such as SAT, ACT), or Ge orgia High School Graduation Test in English/Language Arts if the scores me et the college program's required minimums. If a student's SAT, ACT, or Georgia High School Graduation Test in English/Language Arts scores do not meet the college's program minimums for regular admission, a student must be assessed using one of the TCSG-approved instruments. Assessment results will be valid for placement purposes for a period of 60 months and are transferable to any TCSG college. Official transcripts from a regionally or nationally accredited postsecondary institution recognized by the United States Department of Education documenting equivalent program-level English and math coursework successfully completed (C or better) may be used in lieu of co mpleting the corresponding portion of the TCSG-approved assessment instrument. Admissions Categories Minimum admissions requirements are established for each program. Students shall be admitted to Ogeechee Technical College in one of the following categories: Regular, Provisional, Learning Support, Special, or Transient. Regular Status Students who meet all requirements for admission into a selected program and are eligible to take all courses in the program curriculum are granted Regular admission status. An y change in the credential being sought shall require a student to meet the admission requ irements of the new credential. Provisional Status Students who do not meet all requirements for Regular admission into a selected program are granted Provisional admission status. Provisionally admitted students may take learning support classes and certain specified occupational courses as long as class pre- and co-requisites are satisfied. All certificate, diploma, and associate degree program stud ents initially admitted on a provisional basis must have satisfactorily completed the necessary prerequisite and lear ning support coursework in order to progress through the State Standard Curriculum. Learning Support Status Applicants who score below the provisional cut scores in English, math, or reading are granted Learning Support status or referred to Adult Education. Students with Learning Support status may not take occupational courses until achieving Provisional status. Students with this status are not eligible for federal financial aid (i.e. Pell, SEOG, or Federal Work Study). Special Admit Status (Non-credential seeking) Applicants who wish to take credit coursework but are no t seeking a certificate, diplom a, or associate degree are granted Special Admit status. The following spec ifics define the parameters of this status: May apply up to a maximum of 25 credit hours into a specific program for credential seeking purposes after achieving regular admit status. The hours taken as a special admit student in no way waives the requirements of the regular admission process. May enroll in classes only on a space-available basis. Should adhere to the specific institutional prer equisite requirements when selecting courses.

A student suspended for disciplinary reasons may be consid ered for readmission at the end of the suspension by making an appointment with the Vice President for Student Affairs. Readmission to a program will be granted on a space-avai lable basis within the appropriate course sequence. A student will be required to complete the curriculum requirem ents in place at the time of re-enrollment. Also, some 20 programs have specific readmission guidelines. Visit the individual program description in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook for specific program readmission procedures. Advanced Placement Admission of Transfer Students Applicants to Ogeechee Technical Coll ege (OTC) who have been previously en rolled at a postsecondary institution will be considered for admission under the following policies: Applicants who are in good standing at their previous institution may be accepted in good standing; and Applicants who are on academic probation at their previous institution may be accepted on academic probation. Applicants who wish to transfer to OT C must meet the entrance requirements and follow the guidelines listed in the \"Program Requirements/Admission Procedures\" section of the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook . Applicants to OTC who have been previously enrolled at a postsecondary institution and desire entrance into one of the competitive admission programs (Echocardiography, Pr actical Nursing, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, or Radiologic Technology) must meet certai n specific requirements listed in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook . Students may be eligible for advanced placement throug h two methods: transfer credit and exemption credit. Transfer Credit Ogeechee Technical College recognizes previous postsecondary coursework by accepting credits earned from other regionally or nationally accredited inst itutions that are applicable to the student's program of study. OTC requires all transfer credits within associate level cou rsework to be taken at regionally accredited institutions that are part of the Commission on Colleges. Credit for courses at an institution accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Technical College System of Georgia and whose entrance requirements and curriculum are equivalent to or greater than those of OTC wi ll be considered for award of transfer credit. Credit may be granted for formal military schools, training and co rrespondence courses in accordance with the American Council on Education. A student who presents credit for eval uation and transfer must be aware that the awarding of credit does not guarantee that institutions subsequently attend ed by the student will accept those credits. Due to the rapid changes in technology and technical in formation, program-specific technical courses will be considered for transfer credit in a program only if the co ursework has been completed wi thin the past five years. Technical courses that were taken five years prior to ad mission to OTC will be evaluated for technical currency for course content by the program faculty. A student desiring consideration of cred it for technical courses or experiences that are more than five years old can request transfer by exemption testing. Transfer credit will be considered without restriction of co mpletion dates for those courses in academic disciplines. Examples of these courses include, but are not limited to , English, psychology, mathematics, physical sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. A student may receive credit for courses taken at another postsecondary institution if: The course taken is essentially the same equivalent course content as the course taken at OTC; The course taken has the same number of credit hours (or greater) as the course taken at OTC; An official transcript is on file in the student's admi ssion file from all postsecondary institutions attended; and A grade of \"C\" or higher has been earned for the course to be transferred. A grade of \"TR\" will be entered on the permanent record if credit is awarded. The hours will not be computed in the grade point average or appear on the quarterly grade report. For competitive admissions programs, grades for credit earned as transfer credit will be evaluated for GPA and calculated into the GPA under consideration for program admission. A student who has attended a previous college and is eligible for transfer of credit for English and math is not required to take the COMPASS placemen t exam. However, if the student for an y reason takes the exam and scores indicate the need for a Learning Support class, the student forfeits evaluation of his/her transcript, and the scores on the exam will determine placement, except in the case of a competitive admission program. 21 Transient Courses A transient student is a student who is currently enrolled at one postsecondary institution seeking to take classes at another postsecondary institution. At OTC, students must obtain permission from their program advisor before applying as a transient student to other postsecondary institutions. To ensure coursework and learning outc omes are at the collegiate level, OTC requires that associate degree level educational coursework taken as a transi ent student be taken at a regionally accredited institution. However, if students cannot find the associate degree course offered at a regionally accredited college, they must request a \"Faculty Credentials Form\" be sent from the Registrar's office at OTC to the Registrar of the non-regionally accredited host institution. Grading procedures for transien t students are the same as for traditional students. Therefore, the transient student's grade will be sent from the host school to OTC (home sc hool) for recording of the grade upon completion of the course. The grade becomes a part of the student's permanent record. The hours will be computed in the grade point average and will appear on the student's transcript. Armed Services Credit Credit may be awarded for education/training experiences in the Armed Services. Such experiences must be certified by the American Council on Education (identified in the Council's publication: Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services ). Credit will be given on the basis of individual evaluation. Credible military experience must cl osely correspond to course(s) in the OT C curriculum in content and competencies. Foreign Earned Credit Credit may be awarded for foreign earned courses based upon an evaluation performed by an independent evaluation service. Applications are available in the Admissions Office . The Registrar will make the final decision regarding the award of transfer credit. Grade points will not be assigned to transfer credit. Institutional Exemption Exam A student may receive credit for courses by passing an exemption examination only if the student has never attempted the course nor made a grade of D or F in an equivalent course at OTC or another postsecondary institution. A student cannot withdraw from a course an d register to take an exemption examination within the same quarter nor can a student take an exemption examinat ion if he/she is currently registered for the course. Students wishing to pursue credit by examination must: Be admitted and enrolled in a program of study at Ogeechee Technical College; Be able to present evidence which would indicate th at the student has the education, training, or work experience similar to that given in a course bein g challenged, and not a faculty member from his/her program; Complete the Application for Credit by Examination form, and obtain approval from the student's academic advisor and the instructor responsible for administ ering the exam, the Academic Dean, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs; Take the application to the Business Office in Buildi ng 600 (JEK Annex) and pay the TCSG approved non- refundable fee for the examination; Present the application and a receipt of payment to the instructor responsible for administering the examination; and Earn a score of at least a \"C\". For competitive admissions programs, grades for credit earned by exemption exam will be evaluated for GPA and calculated into the GPA under consideration for program admission. The examination will be taken during the week of final ex aminations unless otherwise approved on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs. A grad e of \"EX\" will be entered on the permanent record if the exemption exam is successfully completed. The hours for th e exempted grades will not be computed in the grade point average. Exemption exams may be taken twice and must be a course or an elective in the student's program of study. NOTE: Academic Affairs determines which courses are availa ble for course exemption and a listing of courses eligible for exemption examinations is available upon request. 22 Residence Requirements for Degree/Diploma Ogeechee Technical College requires that a minimum of twen ty-five percent (25%) of the coursework of a particular program of study be completed at Ogeechee Tech to be granted an award. Secondary School Articulation Ogeechee Technical College is required to establish articu lation agreements wi th interested area high schools to ensure that students receive course credit when established competencies have been achieved. Formal Articulation Agreement - Ogeechee Tech is required to develop formal written agreements with interested area high schools that give credit based on competencies achieved in selected courses. Validation of Credit - Ogeechee Tech must validate student competencies before awarding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school by administering th e final examination/exemption examination for the course to be articulated. Transferability of Credit - Ogeechee Tech must honor loca l articulation agreements statewide when students move from one area of the state to another. Each Technical College can determine its preferred method of competency validation. Local articulation agreements between Ogeechee Tech and secondary schools shall determine the length of time students have to use arti culated credit processes. 23 24 CAMPUS SAFETY AND SECURITY CAMPUS SECURITY ............................................................................................................... ....................................... 24 VEHICLE REGISTRATION AND PARKING PERMITS ...................................................................................... ......... 24 PARKING AND TRAFFIC REGULATIONS ............................................................................................... ................... 24 ADMINISTRATIVE REVI EW AND APPEAL .............................................................................................. ................. 25 ACCIDENT INSURANCE ............................................................................................................ ................................... 25 EMERGENCY OPERATIO SAFETY ...............................................................................................

Individual students and Technical College employees, acting in their personal capacities, remain free to interact with governmental represen tatives as they deem appropriate. Academic Misconduct Academic misconduct is any act that does or could improp erly distort students' grades or other student academic records. A student enrolls at Ogeechee Te chnical College to gain technical skills to lead to grea ter employability. Academic misconduct is not only \"cheatin g\" the student of learning the needed sk ills; it is an offense to the academic integrity of the learning environment. All forms of academic dishonesty will call for discipline. Procedure for Academic Misconduct The procedure for dealing with academic misconduct and dishonesty is as follows: First Offense Student will be assigned a grade of \"0\" for the test or assi gnment. Instructor keeps record in course/program files and notes as first offense. Student's program advisor will also be notified. Second Offense Student is given a grade of \"WF\" for the course in which o ffense occurs. Instructor submit s name to Office of Student Affairs indicating a \"WF\" has been issued as a result of second offense. Student's program advisor will also be notified. Third Offense Student is given a grade of \"WF\" for the course in which the offense occurs. Instructor submits student's name to Office of Student Affairs indicating a \"W F\" has been issued and is student's third offense. Student Affairs would note it as third offense and schedule a judi cial hearing following the guidelines in Article IV: Judicial Policies in the Catalog and Student Handbook. Article IV: Judicial Policies Charges and Hearings Any member of the Technical College community may file charges against any student for misconduct. Charges shall be prepared in writing and directed to the Judicial Advisor responsible for the administration of the Technical College judicial sy stem. Any charge should be submitted as soon as possible after the event takes place, preferably within ten (10) business days. 46 The Judicial Advisor may conduct an investigation to determine if the charges have merit and/or if they can be disposed of administratively by mutual consent of the parties involved on a basis acceptable to the Judicial Advisor. Such disposition shall be final, and there shall be no subsequent proceedings. If the charges cannot be disposed of by mutual consent, th e Judicial Advisor may later serve in the same matter as the judicial body or a member thereof. At the accused student's discretion, a hearing shall be held before either the Judicial Advisor or the Judicial Bo dy (Technical College Student Discipline Committee). All charges shall be presented to the accused student in written form. A time shall be set for a hearing, not less than five nor more than fifteen (15) business days after the student has been notified. Maximum time limits for scheduling of hearings may be extend ed at the discretion of the Judicial Advisor. Hearings shall be conducted by the Judicial Advisor or Judicial Body according to the following guidelines: Hearings normally shall be conducted in private; Admission of any person to the he aring shall be at the discretion of the judicial body and/or its Judicial Advisor; In hearings involving more than one accused studen t, the Chair of the judicial body may permit the hearings concerning each student to be conducted separately; The complainant and the accused have the right to be assisted by any advisor they choose, at their own expense. The advisor may be an attorney. The complainant and/or the accused is responsible for presenting his/her own case and, therefore, advisors are not permitted to speak nor to participate directly in any he aring before a judicial body; The complainant, the accused and th e judicial body shall have the privilege of presenting witnesses, subject to the right of cross ex amination by the judicial body; Pertinent records, exhibits and wr itten statements may be accepted as evidence for consideration by a judicial body at the discretion of the Chair; All procedural questions are subject to the fina l decision of the Chair of the judicial body; After the hearing, the judicial body shall determine (b y majority vote if the judicial body consists of more than one person) whether the student has vi olated each section of the Student Code which the student is charged with violating; The judicial body's determination shall be made on the basis of whether it is more likely than not that the accused student violated the Student Code except in those instances where the student faces suspension or expulsion, in which case the st andard of proof shall be by clear and convincing evidence. There shall be a single verbatim record, such as a tape recording, of all hearings before a judicial body. The record shall be the property of the Technical College. Except in the case of a student charged with failing to obey the summons of a ju dicial body or Technical College official, no student may be found to have violated the Student Code solely because the student failed to appear before a judicial body. In all cases, the evidence in support of the charges shall be presented and considered. Sanctions The following sanctions may be imposed upon any st udent found to have violated the Student Code: Warning: A notice in writing to the student th at the student is violating or has violated institutional regulations.

This may also mean expulsion from a particular program at the Technical College. More than one of the sanctions listed above may be imposed for any single violation. Other than Technical College suspension or expulsion, disciplinary sanctions shall not be made part of the student's permanent academic record, maintained by the Office of Admissions and Records, but shall become part of the student's confidential record, maintained by the Vice President for Student Affairs. Upon graduation, the student's confidential record ma y be expunged of disciplinary actions, Technical College suspension, or Technical College expulsio n, upon application to the Judicial Advisor. In addition to the penalties outlined abov e, groups or organizations may also face: Deactivation; Loss of all privileges, including Technical College recognition, for a specified period of time. In cases heard by the judicial body (Technical College Student Discipline Committee) where the student or organization is found to have violated the Stud ent Code, the judicial body may make recommendations to the Judicial Advisor but the Judi cial Advisor shall determine and im pose the sanctions. The Judicial Advisor is not bound by the sanctions recommended by members of the judicial body. The Judicial Advisor shall notify the student(s) in writing of his/ her final decision. In cases involving sanctions that include probation, suspension, or expulsion, the Judicial Advisor shall inform, by memorandum, the Offices of the Vice President for Ac ademic Affairs and Student Affairs.

Such appeals shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Judicial Advisor or his or her designee. In cases where the Technical College is the complainant, the Technical College shall have no right of appeal. Except as required to explain the basis of new evidence, an appeal shall be limited to review of the verbatim record of the initial hearing and supporting documents for one or more of the following purposes: To determine whether the original hearing was conducted fairly in light of the charges and evidence presented, and in conformity with the pr escribed procedures giving the complaining party a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence that the Student Code was violated, and giving the accused student a reasonable opportunit y to prepare and to present a rebuttal of those allegations. To determine whether the decision reached regard ing the accused student was based on substantial evidence, that is, whether the facts in the case we re sufficient to establish that a violation of the Student Code occurred. 48 To determine whether the sanction(s) imposed were appropriate for the violation of the Student Code that the student was found to have committed. To consider new evidence, sufficien t to alter a decision or other re levant facts not brought out in the original hearing, because the person appealing did not know such evidence and/or facts at the time of the original hearing. In considering an appeal, the Appellate Board may (a) uphold the appeal and reduce or suspend sanctions, (b) uphold the appeal and increase or impose sancti ons, (c) dismiss the appeal and affirm the original sanction(s). The decision of the Appellate Board shall be final.

DEFINITIONS: Grievable issues: Issues arising from the application of a policy/procedure to the student's specific case is always grievable. Specifically grievable are issues re lated to student advisement, improper disclosure of grades, unfair testing procedures and poor treatment of students; this is a representative list and is not meant to be exhaustive.

The decision of either the President or the cross-functional committee shall be made within 10 business days of receipt by the President of the appeal. Whichever process is chosen by the President, th e decision of the grievance appeal is final. Retaliation against a studen t for filing a grievance is strictly prohibited. VI. RECORD RETENTION: Documents relating to formal grievances including investigations, dispositions and the grievance itself shall be held for 5 years after the graduation of the student or the date of the student's last attendance.

Grade Point Average The quarterly grade point average (GPA) is the numerical average computed by dividing total quality points (for each course, hours attempted multiplied by grade value) by total hours attempted in a quarter (see below). A cumulative GPA is calculated by dividing total qual ity points by total hours attempted at the College. Class Code Course Title Hrs Attempted Grade Grade Value Quality Points MAT 1013 Algebraic Concepts 5 A 4 20 ENG 1010 Fundamentals of English I 5 B 3 15 SCT 100 Intro. Microcomputers 3 F 0 0 EMP 1000 Interpersonal Relations and Prof. Development 3 C 2 6 16 41 For example: 41 Total Quality Points divided by 16 Hours attempted equals a GPA of 2.56. Work Ethics At Ogeechee Technical College, it is extremely important to encourage good work habits as an integral part of the instructional program. To achieve this, every credit course at Ogeechee Tech incorporates concepts of work ethics into the course curriculum. Desirabl e work traits are emphasized, includ ing attendance, character, teamwork, appearance, attitude, productivity, organizational skills, communication, cooperation, and respect. As part of the evaluation process, the student receives a work ethics grade for each course. The work ethics grades are designed to evaluate and encourage good work habits. Performance factors and indicators include, but are not limited to, quality of work, ability to follow instructions, pr oductivity, dependability, honesty, reliability, attendance and punctuality, attitude, integrity, enthus iasm, interpersonal skills, and initiative. 64 Students receive a work ethics grade (3, 2, 1 or 0) each qu arter for each course in which they enroll. The work ethics grade does not affect the academic grade point average (GPA) of a student; work ethics grades remain separate from academic grades. Work Ethics grades are posted qu arterly to the student's tr anscript via BannerWeb. Work Ethics Descriptions: Exceeds Expectations: 3 Meets Expectations: 2 Needs Improvement: 1 Unacceptable: 0 Grade Reports Final grades are recorded by instructors. Official grades are posted to the student's transcript via BannerWeb. Academic Appeals Ogeechee Technical College faculty and ad ministrative staff have the right and responsibility to exercise professional judgment in making decisions about student performance and progress. The College is accountable for setting and maintaining standards of academic performance and is committed to ensuring students are treated fairly in regard to all matters that relate to academic performance and progress. A student will be provided with a fair opportunity to have decisions that are believed by the student to negati vely impact academic performance and progress reviewed in accordance with policies and procedures established by the College. Informal If a student believes that a basis exists for appealing an academic decision regarding a grade which prevents progression in a program of study, that student should first attempt to resolve th e matter informally through discussion with the instructor who made the decision. A student has five (5) working days to discuss the academic decision. If no resolution can be reached within these five (5) working days, then the student will have another five (5) working days to discuss the concern with the Dean for Academic Affairs. The expectation is that the difference of opinion is to be resolved as closely as possible to the level at which it originated, and as quickly as is possible wi th careful review. It is only when a disagreement cannot be resolved through this informal process that a form al appeal of the academic decision should be made. A student may seek advice from a counselor for support and direction. Formal Once a decision has been made that the informal process has not resulted in resolution, formal procedures will begin. Written notification to the Dean for Academic Affairs must be made regard ing the decision under question. The Dean for Academic Affairs, upon completion of his/he r review (course outline, documentation related to the student's progress, transcript, summary of events, etc.) ma y uphold, modify, or reverse the academic decision. The Dean for Academic Affairs will notify the student, the in structor, and the Registrar (if necessary) in writing of his/her decision with a rationale for the decision. If any party believes that the decision is not fair or reas onable, the decision may be appealed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. This gives the opportunity to ensure that all necessary and relevant information, documentation, opinion, and argument are fairly presented. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs is final. Repeating Courses By registering for a course fo r which the student has already received credit , a student forfeits the previous credit in that course for graduation purposes. The student's official grade for graduation purposes in the course(s) will be the last one earned on repetition. Although all grades remain on the official academic record, only the final attempt will be calculated for the purpose of meeting graduation requirements. For graduation purposes, a student must have a grad uation GPA of a 2.0 and a cumulative GPA of 2.0. A student who fails or who does not earn a grade of \"C \" or higher as required fo r courses specified in the OTC Catalog and Student Handbook within two attempts will no t be allowed to repeat that course for one year and will be allowed to retake a third time on a space-available basis only. Before retaking a course the third time, the student must complete an individualized re medial program assigned by the appropriate Dean for Academic Affairs. 65 Academic Probatio n and Suspension Students must maintain a minimum of a 2.0 cumulative grad e point average to be in satisfactory academic standing. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0 will be placed on academic probation for the next academic quarter. A student is subject to suspension for on e quarter if the cumulative gr ade point average is less than a 2.0 during the quarter enrolled on ac ademic probation. Students will be advised and counseled as to academic deficiencies and given official notifi cation of academic probation/suspen sion status. Academic probation or suspension is indicated on the student's transcript via BannerWeb and recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Academic Transcript Request Process Students can receive an unofficial transc ript via BannerWeb. The first official tr anscript for a student is provided free of charge. A fee of $5.00 will be charged for each additional official transcript, which must be paid before the transcript is released. Transcripts will not be released externally without the student's written co nsent unless as directed by law to comply. (Transcripts will be released in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. However, every reasonable attempt will be made to noti fy the student in advance of the compli ance.) An academic transcript will be issued within three (3) business days of receiving a written request. The Academic Transcript Request form may be obtained in the Registrar's Office or on the Ogeechee Tech website. If the student is unable to come to the Registrar's Office or download the form, Ogeechee Technical College will accept written consent in the form of a letter (either mailed or faxed) from the student. Exemption Credit Credit by Exemption Examination Eligibility Ogeechee Tech provides the student an opportunity to receive credit for courses by successfully completing an exemption examination. Ogeechee Tech may allow students to exempt courses by demonstrating thorough mastery of written and/or performance tests that have be en developed locally intended to adequately demonstrate achievement of the necessary competency level. A student attempting to earn credit by examination must be accepted and enrolled in a program of study at Ogeechee Technical College. The course must be a course or elective in the student's program of study. The student cannot take an exemption examination if he/she is currently registered for the course.

For more information, contact the Office of the Registrar at 912.486.7865 or an academic advisor. Enrollment Verification Students requiring verification for insurance, loan defe rments, military I.D., past and current enrollment, and degree(s) earned can now access this information through the Self-Service program with the National Student Clearinghouse. Ogeechee Technical College has authorized the National Student Clearinghouse to provide enrollment verification certifications for students throug h its Web-based Student Self-Ser vice program. Student Self- Service enables students to print official enrollment verifi cation certifications on demand through their BannerWeb account at www.ogeecheetech.edu. Instructions are located in the Registrar's Office and online. Verification of enrollment status is based on the number of quarter hours for which a student is or was enrolled. Full-time students carry 12 or more quarter hours, three-qu arter students carry nine to eleven quarter hours, half- time students carry six to eight hours, and less than half-time students carry one to five hours. Withdrawals Withdrawing from a Course Since choosing to drop a course is a serious academic decisi on that may affect a student's progress towards a degree or a student's financial aid status, a student should consult with the instructor of the course, the academic advisor, and a financial aid advisor before making this decision. 67 Withdrawing From the College If a student is considering withdrawing from the College, the student is strongly encouraged to discuss this with an advisor or a counselor before formalizing the decision to ensure that all alternatives are considered. In order to withdraw officially from the College, a student must complete an Application for Withdrawal form, available from the Counseling and Retention Coordinator. The effective date of withdr awal is the la st date the student attended or logged into his/her class.

In certain cases, the Counselor or Registrar may act on beha lf of the student in completing the withdrawal process. Typically, this would occur in cases involving death, seri ous injury or illness, or formal requests to do so. Failure to attend classes does not consti tute an official withdrawal. Students who fail to continue attending class and who do not complete an Application for Withdrawal may be awarded a WF grade by the instructor. The instructor must still report the last date the student attended or lo gged into his/her cla ss to comply with the Federal Refund Policy.
