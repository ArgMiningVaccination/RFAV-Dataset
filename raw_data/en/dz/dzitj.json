A suspiciously smooth forehead? Outer corners of eyes, where no crows seemed to have splayed their feet? Or a pair of eyebrows so artificially high they look as though they're trying to climb up into the hairline? It's likely that the injectable is more common - and less obvious - than you think. Anti-wrinkle injectables such as Botox, (as well as neuromodulator treatments such as Xeomin, and Jeuveau) make up nine out of 10 cosmetic procedures in the UK and since 2011, the number of people receiving fillers or Botox has risen by a staggering 41%, fuelling an industry that's now worth \u00a32.75billion in the UK. Why? Well, such procedures have seeped into our culture like butter into a crumpet. A 2018 survey by You Gov revealed that 10% of female viewers of ITV's Love Island have considered breast enhancement or Botox after watching the show, while the SISU Aesthetics Clinic in Ireland reported a [200% increase in lip-filler bookings](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-island-contestants-cosmetic-surgery-demand-increase-megan-lip-fillers-botox-a8433401.html) after the arrival of Megan Barton Hanson on series four. Now, we're not saying whether you should reach for the needle, or not - but we do think you should have all the information before making your own educated decision. Scroll on for 14 things you should be aware of, courtesy of a couple of experts. But first, a few FAQSs. What is Botox used for? Mostly, Botox is used for reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles on your face, by paralysing the underlying muscles. But it can also be used as a treatment for migraines and for excess sweating (hello, armpits). How long does Botox last? Botox wears off; usually, people come every three to six months, on average, for top-ups. Some people leave it longer, others leave it less - it's personal preference and the person treating you can advise on this. How much does Botox cost? According to the NHS website, the cost of Botox injections can vary from about \u00a3100 to \u00a3350 for each treatment, depending on the clinic and the area being treated. Where does Botox come from? If the very word 'injectables' calls to mind a Kardashian, you'd be forgiven -though their origin story is rather more pedestrian. It begins with a 19th century sausage, when a Belgian scientist traced a food poisoning outbreak back to botulinum toxin (which is how the Botox drug got its name) within meat. By the 1940s, it was being used to treat patients with strabismus (crossed eyes). The discovery of its other merit, decades later, was a happy accident. In 1987, Dr Jean Carruthers, a Canadian eye specialist, was using Botox to treat a female patient's blepharospasm - or eye twitching - when the woman reported that the formula was having a wrinkle-reducing effect. Dr Carruthers shared the news with her husband, a dermatologist, and together they spent five years investigating their cosmetic breakthrough. They published their first study in 1992 and, a decade later, Botox was approved for cosmetic use in the UK. What is the difference between botox and anti-wrinkle injections? Aesthetic surgeon Dr Glyn Estebanez from Prima Aesthetics explains that 'there is no difference between Botox and anti-wrinkle injections. Botox is simply the trade or brand name for botulinum toxin'. 'Botox, or Botulinum Toxin Type A, is a purified protein that relaxes the facial muscles that cause lines and wrinkles. It works by blocking the neurotransmitter acetylcholine causing muscle paralysis. The reason why so many people call anti-wrinkle injections 'Botox' is because this is the original and possibly most well-known name for anti-wrinkle injections, however there are now multiple brands of anti-wrinkle injections available.' Is Botox safe? Yes clarifies Dr Estebanez. 'It has been extensively tested over decades and is safe to use when performed by a medical practitioner who has the appropriate qualifications and experience and can be used to treat and reduce dynamic lines on the face such as frown lines and crow's feet, thin out bulky jaw muscles (to slim the lower face) as well as to treat conditions such as neck spasms, excessive sweating and chronic migraines.' What are the other main types of anti-wrinkle injections? So, turns out there are quite a few. 'Since the introduction of Botox as the brand of Botulinum toxin, a number of other brands have been introduced including Myobloc, Dysport, Bocouture, Xeomin, Vistalbel, and Azzulure,' says Dr Estebanez. There are some minor differences between the brands but essentially they all work in much the same way to relax muscles and reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles. It is however important to do your research into each brand and ensure that you visit an adequately trained medical professional as unfortunately there are now a number of fake products as well as unscrupulous professionals offering brands lacking efficacy and even unsafe,' he adds. What are the dangers of botox? 'Botulinum toxin is the most poisonous neurotoxin and could therefore be life threatening,' reveals Dr Estebanez, which sounds quite terrifying. However, he goes on to say that 'when administered in small doses like the ones that are used for Botox, it is considered to be extremely safe. The main risks with having Botox or any anti-wrinkle injections are not from the drug itself, but from treatment that is performed by a practitioner who is not qualified or experienced.' 'The anatomy of the face is extremely complex and the best treatment plans need to consider the nuances of the individuals face. If Botox isn't injected into the correct place or in the correct way then complications such as infection, vision problems, breathing problems, temporary asymmetry of the face or drooping of the eyelid or eyebrow can occur. Complications such as these are, however, rare if in the right hands,' he clarifies. What are the bad side effects of Botox? Botox is viewed as a safe procedure. But, like with all medical procedures, there are possible side effects. According to the NHS, after treatment, you might have a headache and flu-like symptoms for 24 hours following the injections. You might see bruising and swelling around the areas that were injected and temporary droopiness in areas like your eyelids and eyebrows. Worst case scenario? You could experience blurred or double vision if the area around your eyes was injected. Is botox good for your face? Dr Estebanez explains that 'Botox does not only address fine lines and wrinkles making the skin appear smoother and younger looking, new [ research](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/6e6364653bc777f0673729511596bdb84d88a1f1?url=https*3A*2F*2Fwww.nbcwashington.com*2Fnews*2Flocal*2Fchanging-minds*2Fbotox-may-give-a-mental-health-boost-study-says*2F2964112*2F*23*3A**A3Atext*3DNew*2520medical*2520research*2520suggests*2520Botox*2Cwere*252020*2520to*252070*2525*2520lower.&userId=7425451&signature=ab6734ee08186da8__;JSUlJSUlJSUlJSV-JSUlJSUlJSUlJSUl!!Ivohdkk!iPSw0njFYMiS9Xv8-rvo-oS3LR2EuOezpS2IbEQNU8PiPckb9hd6reXVcshZ9s3V2c9JK5wnYUi7slGiCEkKOu_nQ7sP-Q$) also suggests that Botox may help to improve your mental health, reducing anxiety levels. Ultimately, if you are looking to rejuvenate your appearance, anti-wrinkle injections can offer great results if carried out by someone who has a thorough understanding of both the anatomy and the toxin itself.' 14 things you should know about Botox To get you dosed up on the truth on these treatments, WH called upon cosmetic doctor [Dr David Jack,](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X1380942&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdrdavidjack.com%2F) as well as celebrity cosmetic doctor [Dr Tijion Esho](https://www.eshoclinic.co.uk/), to separate the Botox fact from fiction. So if you're set on freezing those lines then this is everything you need to know, and consider, before taking the plunge. 1. Botox works like this 'The molecules attach to the nerve endings in your muscles to block the impulse from the nerves that make the muscle contract,' says Dr Jack. When muscles move, they pull on the skin causing lines to appear. The most common places to have Botox injected are the frown lines, forehead and around the eyes. Some will administer it to the lower face to soften lines too. 2. Botox is not the same as filler 'Unlike Botox, fillers are a gel and not a toxin,' says Dr Jack. They are injected under the skin, not into the muscle. The most common filler is [hyaluronic acid](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/beauty/skin/a28133440/hyaluronic-acid/) (which is naturally occurring in the body). By replacing lost volume, it acts as a temporary filler. You can have fillers in places that lose volume with age, such as lips and cheeks. They both address lines, just in different ways. 3. It's key to research your practitioner Dr Esho stresses the importance of seeking out a skilled practitioner who is registered with a medical body - so, a doctor, nurse or dentist. If they don't offer, ask the person you're considering what their credentials are. A non-medical pro who has taken a short course in injecting? Beware. Dr Esho advises that a solid practitioner will ensure you have a consultation prior to any treatment, ensure you understand the effect you're aiming for and the possible risks. Everything should happen in a clinical setting - not the back of a salon. They should also offer you the chance of a follow-up appointment, two to three weeks after treatment. Most recently MPs have said 'The \"complete absence\" of regulation of non-surgical beauty treatments, such as botox-style injections and fillers, is dangerous and must urgently change\". Dr Tristan Mehta, founder of Harley Academy and STORY, recognised a long time ago that this was a huge issue in the aesthetic world and he single-handily set about to rectify this by creating a new qualification in the injection. 'We devised the [Level 7 Diploma in Botox and Dermal Fillers](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.harleyacademy.com/training/level-7/__;!!Ivohdkk!0vCF3Zv8gsPNSJsSLoXwLX2uugDuz8zSnxnq8fhTfBBk-YJG5iMb1CwX8PXZW3Q8MnxvRhI$) and partnered with the JCCP so that healthcare professionals can access best-in-class, holistic training in medical aesthetics. This is the gold standard in aesthetic medicine qualifications and is something the public can look for when researching treatment providers.' 'Being Level 7 qualified shows you have been trained to be a safe and ethical injector - that you have received Master's level training from experts in the field. It shows you have studied not just injecting techniques but also anatomy, facial ageing, skin ageing, preventing and managing complications... the list goes on,' adds Dr Mehta. 4. Stay away from 'cheap' deals Dr Esho says that around \u00a3150 for one area of the face is the sort of starting price you should be looking at. You might just want the one zone (say, forehead); you might want multiple (frown lines, as well.) 'If someone quotes you something like \u00a350 an area, I'd worry,' he advises. 5. Less is more You don't want to freeze your face. Dr Jack warns that muscle atrophy (where a specific muscle can waste away) is a possibility when Botox is overdone - specifically, when it is repeatedly administered to the point where you can't move the muscle. As with any muscle that you're not using; it will start to waste away, which could mean a bit of a lid droop because there is not the same level of muscular support there. A little movement is okay, and a more modern approach. 6. Manage your expectations Botox can be a handy tool for decreasing how intense wrinkles and lines appear, but it's not fairy dust. 'There are two types of lines, dynamic and static,' explains Dr Esho. 'Static lines are visible when your face is at rest, but dynamic are more visible when you say, laugh or scrunch your face up.' The latter are easier to treat with Botox and should be responsive. The former, however, may present as deeper lines, which could need more than one Botox session, or the additional use of filler. 7. Having Botox won't necessarily boost your self-esteem That women are seeking Botox out at a young age makes the framing of injectables as a tool for self-empowerment all the more concerning, says Renee Engeln, professor of psychology at northwestern university in the US and author of [ Beauty Sick.](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X1380942&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fbeauty-sick%2Frenee-engeln%2F9780062469786) 'If doctors want to sell more cosmetic procedures as \"treatments\", then they need to decide what disease these procedures are treating,' she says. 'Suggesting they treat \"low confidence\" sounds superficially more empowering than admitting that Botox and fillers are designed to disguise the perfectly normal process of ageing.' She argues that this shift is capitalising on female insecurity, and adding fuel to the fire of an appearance-centric culture - a culture that research has linked with the development of self-esteem-related issues; studies have found an association between appearance-based exchanges and poor body image and disordered eating, for example. 8. You don't need to sleep sitting upright 'There is a myth that the night after getting Botox you should sleep upright,' says Dr Jack. 'It's just not true. You can go about your normal day and night routine. I even go to the gym afterwards. You may experience some mild headaches while the Botox is getting to work, but that's it.' 9. It takes 7-10 days to see results Sure, it's quicker and more effective than a cream, but it doesn't work instantly. You'll notice a softening and restriction of movement after three to four days, with the full effect becoming noticeable between days seven and 10. 10. Botox is not a preventative 'Botox is a medicine and so you want to inject it at the right time. I don't agree that early, preventative injections come at the right time,' says Dr Jack. 'If you look at your face when it's completely at rest and there are deep lines or wrinkles there, then that is the time you could start getting Botox, if you want to. Fine lines from dehydration? That's not.' 11. Your skin improves once you have Botox The restricted movement of the skin gives it a chance to rest and regenerate itself - to an extent. This doesn't mean you can relax with your cleansing and skincare routine, however. 12. Several studies suggest Botox can mitigate depression A study published in the journal Scientific Reports last July added weight to existing research on the connection; researchers found that depression was reported between 40% and 88% less often by those who'd received botulinum toxin for cosmetic reasons, as well as for conditions like migraines and neck pain, than by those who received a different treatment for the same condition. 'For years, clinicians have observed that Botox injected for cosmetic reasons seems to ease depression for their patients,' said Dr Ruben Abagyan, professor of pharmacy at theUniversity of California, San Diego, who worked on the study. Dr Paul Nassif, Facial and Reconstructive Plastic Surgeon and owner of NassifMD Medical Spa UK says that it could be beneficial to specifically inject Botox into the faces of those who suffer with depression. 'Our facial expressions contribute to how we feel, in the way that smiling can make you feel better by doing it. So, there is an argument to suggest you can possibly influence mood by restricting the ability to frown. 'The thought process is that is motion creates emotion, therefore if you relax the muscles that you use when you are feeling anxious or angry, and you cannot frown, you may not feel sad. Once the face is set into a natural resting state, the mechanisms of the body behave differently and the less stress response is created,' he explains. 13. Botox doesn't work on everyone The body actually develops antibodies to Botox, which means it eventually stops working. 'I've only had two or three patients in the past seven years where it has simply not worked, but it can happen,' elaborates Dr Jack. 'As for allergic reactions? I've personally not seen one.' 14. Your covid-19 vaccination may make anti-wrinkle injections less effective An Israeli [study ](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35866341/__;!!Ivohdkk!k_TSxJo7_-HBanVKyMlUPaPmhEzUqqfVGTJxro6ovoMGAv9bqCWLEMxebJqbZ0OmlMjVYdW0NcX37TBpT3bMvfyPB91qOw$)claims that Botulinum toxin type A injections used to minimize forehead and crow's feet lines 'might be less effective after Covid-19 vaccination'. Researchers found the average time that it took patients to need a top-up of the wrinkle-smoother shortened after they received the Pfizer mRNA vaccine. The study, published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, looked at botulinum toxin injectables more generally - not just Botox but also other newer neuromodulator treatments like Dysport, Xeomin, and Jeuveau. It focused on 45 subjects, 89 percent female, with an average age of 48.3. Harley Street aesthetics expert and Independent Nurse Prescriber, Nina Prisk of Update Aesthetics, says: 'I am certainly seeing an increase in people who have had the Covid vaccine and are discovering that their Botulinum type A injections are not lasting as long as they used to. As such some are returning more frequently for treatment. I've read that this could be as a result of the immune response created by the injection which means the body could see the Botulinum type A as a foreign substance and attack it so that the effects wear off faster.' 'However, some people do develop a resistance to Botox over time, regardless of whether they've received the vaccine or not. The good thing is that for people who are noticing their injections wear off quicker than usual there are a number of different treatments available which can achieve the same effect.' Nina Prisk, a highly trained specialist in non-surgical advanced aesthetic procedures and rejuvenation treatments with 14 years nursing experience, says: 'In many ways this is the best time of year for Botox because the drop in temperatures and the wind can cause skin to become more prone to drying out. This results in fine lines and wrinkles becoming more obvious. Combined with the fact that the sun is lower in the winter causing us to squint a lot, it's the worst time of year for crow's feet too.' 'Not a lot of people realise that higher body temperatures can increase the rate at which Botox is metabolised, meaning that the colder weather in the winter can help to make your Botox last longer,' explains Nina Prisk. 'As a result you may not need to repeat the procedure as often as you do in the hotter summer months.' Botox aftercare advice Nurse Prisk advises that you should do the following after having botox injections. 1. Keep upright for the first 4 hours after having facial injectables 'This is because bending down and laying down could potentially spread the toxin or filler and cause it to migrate to other muscles in the face leading to bruising at the injection site or complications. You should also avoid sleeping on the side of your face the first night after having it for the same reason.' 2. Avoid swimming for 2-3 days after injectables 'Swimming can put you at risk of infection in the injection sites so it's advisable to avoid this for 2-3 days after injectables.' 3. Don't fly for at least 24 hours after Botulinum type A injections or fillers 'When you're in a plane the air pressure in the cabin changes, and it's believed that this can affect the positioning of the injectables and potentially cause migration to other muscles.' 4. Avoid strenuous exercise for 12 hours after having Botulinum type A injections 'Strenuous cardiovascular exercise temporarily raises your blood pressure which can exacerbate bruising and swelling on the injection sites and it's also possible that it can cause the toxin to migrate to other areas of the face, potentially resulting in muscle paralysis there.' 5. Avoid saunas for the next two weeks after Botulinum type A injections 'The extreme heat of a sauna can cause the injection points to become more inflamed and the swelling and "}
