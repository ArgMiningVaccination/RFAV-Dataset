EBV+ PTLD is a potentially fatal complication that can occur after transplantation. Following a transplant, patients receive medicines that weaken their immune system (the body's natural defences) to prevent rejection of the transplant. However, their weakened immune system makes these patients vulnerable to infection with viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus. In patients with EBV+ PTLD, the Epstein-Barr virus infects white blood cells called B cells after transplantation, causing changes to these cells that can lead to cancer. Ebvallo is used in patients who have received at least one previous treatment, when the disease comes back (relapsed) or when the treatment does not work (refractory). PTLD is rare, and Ebvallo was designated as an ' [orphan medicine](/en/glossary/orphan-medicine)' (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 21 March 2016.
