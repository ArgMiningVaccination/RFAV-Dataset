As Coordinator of theevent, and as editor of this book, I offer genuine thanks to the Social Science andHumanities Research Council of Canada, and to Brandon University, for their majorsupport.I am especially grateful to Beverly Chapman-Park, who completed the word-processing of this book with rare accuracy, care, and editorial intelligence.Further funding aid from the Manitoba Ministry of Education, the ManitobaMinistry of Northern Affairs, the Canadian National Railway, Heritage Canada, and Tri-Link Industries (Calgary) have valuably contributed to the realization of the \"Voice of theDrum.\"I would like to gratefully thank my mentors and Elders who helped in everyway: to Antoinette Oberg, James B. Macdonald, Robert Patterson, William Schubert andAnne Lopez-Schubert for \"lighting the fire;\" to Shingawauk (Dan Pine) of Garden Riverfor teaching me to be discriminating in compassion; to Edward Onabigon for hisunalloyed friendship and guidance since the sundance at Heron Bay; to Eva McKay,grand-daughter of Sitting Bull, for her counsel and love; and to Mike Hotaine, for hisliving example of being a good-hearted drum-keeper of the Dakota tradition.Special thanks are given to the local Elders who blessed the site of the \"Voice ofthe Drum\" in the spring of 1998 at the onset of the year's first lightning storm: EvaMcKay (Dakota), Jessie Ross (Cree), Isaac Beaulieu (Ojibway), and Calvin Pompana(Dakota). Their many efforts in naming and structuring the event are deeplyappreciated. The formative, creative input of Darryl Racine (Metis) was also vital.Lastly, my unheralded co-organizer, confidante and lifetime partner, Mary Neil,is given my heartfelt thanks forever. You kept me coherent and on my feet throughyour good example, love and trust.Chi Meegwetch (Great thanks!) to you all Ho! This book reflects, in itscontent and aim, the spirited will of grassroots educators, true Elders, and wide-rangingscholars.Most of the authors within these covers participated in the eleven-dayinternational gathering of Indigenous Elders and educators named \"Voice of the Drum.\"The sacred fire burned throughout the event, initiated in a Dakota pipe ceremony led byElders Eva McKay ana C.`21,.;n Pompana. The midpoint of the experience was marked bya traditional Mayan Sun ceremony guided by the daykeeper, Agustin Sapon Morales; aswell as Maori honour of attending organizers andElders, led by Pita Sharples and Elsie Ellison. The closing of the gathering witnessed atranscendental traditional Lakota hoop-dancing performance by Kevin Locke and finalpipe ceremony led by Edward Onabigon, Anishnabe Elder, and Eva McKay, Dakota Elder.The purposeful weaving of high-level intellectual interchange with spiritualcelebration and communion infused many participants with hope and determination.This union of intellectual and spiritual/cultural awareness was nowhere betterexemplified than in the daily morning opening remarks and prayers of the animatorsMarie Battiste, Isaac Beaulieau, and Eva McKay. Introduction: Voice of the Drum Roger Neil These readings have been organized within three areas of Indigenouseducation and culture: IWorldview, IICurriculum Change, and III Governance andPolicies.It is noteworthy that all of the writing herein is contributed by Indigenouspersons, or by those who have for many years devotedly worked hand in hand withIndigenous communities, toward the revitalization of traditional practices andapproaches.IWORLDVIEWThe article \"Circular Vision,\" by Marie Eshkibok-Trudeau, offers arare view into one Anishnabe family's efforts to imbue their daughter's education withtraditional understanding. Insights about the Midewiwin Code Of Life, the clan system,and the vision quest are shared. There is a breath of the realization of timelessness inthe experience that is shared by this Manitoulin Island family. \"Circular Vision\" addssubstance and depth to current research conclusions which have found that active,reciprocal community involvement is an important dimension of research practice inIndigenous education (Dehyle and Swisher, 1997).Herein, Marie contributes substantially to the existing definition of Indigenouscultural identity in her description of characteristic dimensions of identity development:consistent ceremonial preparation, pre-birth and early years song and language,cradleboard teachings, the dynamics and ethics of discipline, life ethics, personal andcommunity clan interactions, immersion in natural settings, the 'key moments' of thevision quest, sacred Grandmother teachings, lodge songs, fasting and dance. Readerswill be grateful to be so thoughtfully reminded of the seven sacred gifts of the Creator:honesty, love, kindness, humility, truth, respect and wisdom.In sharp contrast with the harmony of traditional education efforts, isPaula Ma Ilea's critique, \"When Prison is a School Today's Residential Schools.\"Paula directly compares the realities of Aboriginal people, incarcerated in today's prisons, 113 with the preceding processes of residential school. Relying on a current demographicperspective and a brief political history as a background, Paula outlines factors of racismand violations of human rights that became entrenched in the residential schools ofCanada. Her description of the residential schools corresponds to that which has beenso profoundly documented in the findings in the Report of the Royal Commission onAboriginal Peoples (1996).Paula's justice system experience, as defence counsel, allows her to effectivelyhighlight realities in the legal and penal system. She details courtroomdisenfranchisement and prison isolation: frequent banning of Aboriginal languages,customs, dress and food, as well as the adoption of fundamentalist Christian approachesto rehabilitation. Mallea thus makes a credible point that, as they exist, prisons are, inlarge measure, a \"tool of cultural assimilation.\"Paula Mallea causally links the often poisonous outcomes of the residentialschool system with both the high incidence, and the processes, of incarceration ofAboriginal people. Certainly, the assimilationist policies that engineered the residentialsare recognized to have required the bare sacrifice of Canada's First Nations' traditionalfamily structures. Recognition of the grotesque synergy between yesterday's residentialschools and today's prisons will encourage Canadians to more fairly resolve outstandingTreaties as well as long-term community imbalances.The personal communications that Darrell Racine and Dale Lakevoldhave shared with residential school survivors has inspired the play \"Misty Lake.\"Elizabeth Bear is the kind of person who, when you reach her by telephone, seems to beimmediately present in the room. She and Elizabeth Samuels, among many others, insharing their stories of survival and healing from the Guy Hill Residential School inManitoba, have provided the true touchstone for this piece. Like all genuine works ofart, this intrinsically inspired play speaks for itself, and has already received provincialand national recognition.Of the many indelible ideas within \"Misty Lake,\" two can be highlighted here.The first is that residential schools in Canada, through government and churchpersuasion, coercion, or blunt threat, held Aboriginal children far from their homes forthe greatest part of their childhood and youth. Often, the older siblings would feelpersonally responsible for the well-being of their brothers and sisters (as young as threeand four years old) in these institutions. For the first fifty years of the 20th century, the Canadian death rate in these institutions was 50% (Royal Commission on AboriginalPeoples, 1996; Kirkness & Selkirk-Bowman, 1992). Imagine the debilitating guilt anddepression of the older siblings, should they live through the experience.A second vital highlight of Misty Lake is that one of the key characters is a Metisreporter who is described to be searchingly receptive to the Dene survivor's memoriesand feelings; and then comes to understand the spiritual healing that is sometimesachieved by the survivor's direct confrontation and communication of the horror. It isimportant for us to grasp that the Metis peoples' cultural roots have not been spared thegenocidal force of the residential school processes.One may seek to comprehend the history and present reality of theEuropean colonization of the Americas coarsely or incisively. Coarsely, with a \"winnertakes all\" conceptual framework, one might ignore that early European settlers' survivaloften depended on the established First Nations' humanity and willingness to shareresources. Further, one might ignore the fact that many original territories were held inrelative peace from vying European governments with the cooperation and partnershipof local Aboriginal communities. One might even ignore that better examples ofdemocratic nation states existed in North America than anywhere in Europe prior tocontact. Finally, one might ignore that, in Canada and the United States, there still existhundreds of backlogged court cases that are meant to clarify Treaties of partnershipreaching back to the 1700s (Sioui, 1991; Sioui, 1996; Churchill, 1994).Efforts to arrive at an equitable resolution of these Treaties will help Aboriginaland non-Aboriginal Canadians to reframe their relations beyond the and losers.\" Sa'ke'j incisively describes theassumptions and beliefs of both the colonizers and their latter-day academic apologists.Henderson understands Eurocentricism as an artificial context based on theultra-theory of diffusionism. That is, \"genuine culture\" is seen to emanate centrally fromEurope. Colonization thus takes on the shape of divine intervention for its assumedevolutionary benefits. Non-European regions are falsely explained away as relativelyuninhabited, nomadically (unclaimed) lands, their \"sparse\" populations beingintellectually, as well as spiritually, inferior.The assumption of European cultural superiority rests upon the concept of itsbeing universal, and in its being superior in \"rationality,\" and, thus, generative of 15 progress. With benefit, one might stop to reflect for a moment on the inadequacy ofabraxial thinking which crudely casts the colonizer as \"rational\" in contrast to the\"outlying\" Indigenous cultures as being \"irrational.\" Greater pause would allow for vitalrecognition of the super-rational, the necessary melding of high emotional commitmentexisting within all cultural group's mentation in order to formulate good judgement.Super-rational thought, \"pattern thinking,\" or emotionally-charged judgement has beenclearly recognized as an of both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal awareness(Ross, 1996; Kant, 1892).Sa'ke'j's brief overview of European philosophy highlights the Frankfurt Schooland more current deconstructionism, most frequently critiquing their absence ofrecognition of true alterity (the existence of cultural, natural, spirit-being \"otherness\").In its conclusion, this article is an anthem to some key values of Indigenous world view.In its main body, it explains why, if the reader recognizes cross-culturality, we havearrived at \"the potential termination point of Eurocentric thought.\"Robin June Hood draws upon her extensive experience as an educatorand social animator among the Maya of the Guatemalan highlands in the paper\"Weaving a World of Respect.\" Robin touches upon a number of important aspectsof traditional Mayan education and culture, involving the \"heart of the sky\" and the\"heart of the earth,\" with the guidance of trusted Mayan educators.With a brief historical/political background, Hood highlights Mayan concepts oftime, the Calendars, and a sacred text the Popol Vul. She then details some of thecultural meaning held by the art of weaving among the Maya. Importantly, Robinincludes her translation of a recent interview with Agustin Sapon Morales, a MayanDaykeeper, on the topic of Indigenous education values. :4%\"The Cry of the Loon: Mysterious, Mournful, RememberingPlace.\" For anyone who has observed the loon upon a lake, carrying the nextgeneration of her family on her back, Oscar Kawagley's sharing of the Yupiaq name forthe loon will hold special meaning: \"tunutellek\" that which is packing something.This article outlines specific ways for Indigenous people to resist the currenttechnological monoculture and, instead, to recreate traditional cultural responsibilitiesand strengths. The loon asks \"What was the question that makes technology theanswer in the first place?\"Of particular interest to communities aiming to re-establish traditional values,16 as alternatives to federal/provincial (or state) standards of education, will be AlaskaStandards for Culturally Responsive Schools included as an addendum.IICURRICULUM CHANGEA.Well-Being, the Prelude to Learning(4)As the call of the loon's lament still echoes, Brenda Wastasecoot's\"Culturally Appropriate Healing and Counselling: One Woman's Path TowardHealing\" is meant to preface the papers focused upon Curriculum change at the post-secondary and school levels. Healing and learning are understood to be two sides of thesame coin; realizing that coherent learning cannot take place prior to attaining well-being.Wastasecoot's poignant revelations about effective ways of healing from abuseare deeply moving and very practical. Her clear depiction of the inherent weaknesses ofcommonly employed forms of counselling and medical treatment of traumatic abuse arewell set out. In comparison, effective concrete methods of healing from childhoodtrauma, that Wastasecoot's study discovers, are congruent with traditional Indigenousapproaches.\"Tradition is often hard to isolate ...to some, tradition is doing things the 'oldways,' following the time-honoured steps of the Elders of our communities. To others,tradition is a way of thinking, of showing respect for the values and spirituality of ourancestors, in spite of the way we live today. And to others, tradition is whatever ishanded down from one generation to the next. To most, it is what we learn from ourfamily that makes tradition a viable tool for dealing with the future\" (Hill, in Bruchac,1989: 124-125).Wastasecoot unites all of these definitions in her aim to illuminate sustainablehealing methods...\"Let the torrent of tears wash the pain of our people\" (Elder EvaMcKay, 1998).B.Post-Secondary SystemsIn \"A Sense of Place: Aboriginal Research as Ritual Practice,\"Carolyn Kenny carefully describes the cross-currents of what it means to be anIndigenous person involved in post-secondary education. She further points out thedifficulties of carrying out constructive research in Indigenous communities today, underthe weight of the history of previous researchers' hegemonic practice. Kenny recognizes 17 the site of the university as one of cultural struggle, within which, nevertheless, anAboriginal person's sense of place can grow. She valuably defines \"Aboriginal research\"in a way that includes people without Indigenous status, and yet whose work \"embodiesthe core values and beliefs\" of her Elders.Carolyn's original description of research as ritual practice adds substantially tothe ongoing development and rationalization of qualitative research methodologies.\"An Aboriginal Pedagogical Model: Recovering an AboriginalPedagogy from the Woodlands Cree.\" In this paper, Cathy Wheaton begins with acritique of current practices in Native Studies in the Canadian University context. Shenotes specific dimensions that require attention: consistent and respectful inclusion ofliving Elders, as well as oral tradition processes; recognition of the sacred dimensions ofknowledge; expansion of pedagogical methods; the progressive recognition ofheterogeneity among, and within, Aboriginal culture groups; and increasing directcontact with natural settings.Wheaton then outlines a vigorous process of learning that she reconstitutesfrom a narrative reflection of her traditional upbringing. The main components shedetails are: observation, experience, introspection and inquiry. She construes this modelto be of value within a broad range of settings and levels, and among non-Aboriginal, aswell as Aboriginal, students.C.School Curricula\"Teaching/Learning Across Cultures: Strategies for Success\"by Ray Barnhardt is a carefully constructed guide for any educator setting out to workwith people of diverse cultural backgrounds. His extensive experience in teachereducation consistently rises to the surface of this article in the form of practical advice:How do you enter the community? What do you need to know? What should youteach? How should you teach? How do you determine what has been learned? Rayhas also included school strategies for intercultural communication of \"The 'At-Risk' Student: byMelinda Hrechka, takes the form of a case-study of how resource programming has beenachieved in one First Nations community. Hrechka first carefully defines the concept of\"at risk student\" in a manner that reinforces many of the caveats recently set out byRoland Chrisjohn (1999). Melinda's personal list of nine factors that require consideration to prevent a deficit-approach to children at risk is worthy of seriousconsideration.Her case study allows the reader a good view of positive processes ofdiagnostic testing, individualized programming, and, especially, a close-up view ofconstructive school-community interaction processes. The focus of the case is upon ayoung boy suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome, and the resource teacher'sdevelopment of trust with he and his family.The article \"How Plants Can be Used in the Classroom,\" byNatalie Tays, is an outcome of her working both as a classroom teacher and as aresearcher, who has facilitated university scholar and community Elder discussions abouttraditional medicine plant knowledge. There is an additional curriculum resource entitled\"Aboriginal Plant Use in Canada's Northwest Boreal Forest\" (1999), that could well beused in conjunction with the practical curriculum activities set out by Tays in this paper.The enlarged photographs of mid-northern Manitoba medicine plants in this resource areexcellent, making identification accurate.In the article at hand, Natalie provides a general rationalization for using localplants in the science curriculum, ideas for research projects, and specific hands-onactivities for multiple grade levels. She also focuses upon recognition of certain plantsas first aid medicines. Tays includes some traditional Cree storytelling, and consistentlyunderlines the appropriate approaches of respect for the Elders, in gathering medicineknowledge.IIIGOVERNANCE AND POLICIESRobin J. Manes brings the insight of an experienced ethnobotanist tobear in the article \"The Preservation of Traditional Plant Lore.\" He notes withirony that Canada's Federal Government, in allotting logging rights, has labelled theplant-rich northern forest as being \"non-productive.\" He seriously questions thesustainability of current economic exploitation of the northern resources. Productivelong-term initiatives in First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities will require therecognition and support of the Canadian Government. As clearly depicted in the N.F.B.video \"Wrapped in Plastic\" (1999), many Aboriginal communities have grown by threehundred percent since 1972, yet government funding has steadily diminished. Thepoverty, malnutrition, joblessness and.resulting anomie must be replaced with 71 productive community initiatives in fish-canning, lumber, ecotourism, medicine plantdevelopment, and other sustainable endeavours.Next, Mar les outlines the respectful methods by which he approached Elders fordietary, nutraceutical pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical traditional plant knowledge. Hedescribes a team-work approach of development and disseminating such knowledge. Heacknowledges that much work remains \"to turn our well-intentioned dreams ofcommercial boreal medicinal plant products into a truly sustainable reality\" (Mar les et al.1999). The attached bibliography may serve as a helpful resource on \"The Protection ofIndigenous Intellectual Property Rights.\"In the article, \"Ten Years After: Cross Lake Education AuthorityLocal Control of Indian Education,\" Rebecca Ross describes the Manitobacommunity of Cross Lake's efforts to successfully straddle two worlds of needs:maintaining traditional ways and preparing for current economic needs.In broad brush strokes, she first outlines what has led up to the currenteducation system, involving successive federal, provincial and band-operated means.The history of Cross Lake education is seen to have encompassed wide variations inquality of program, community support and student performance. An explanation of thecommunity demographics is included which details the Education Authority and theschool system.Interesting highlights of innovative in-school and community programs areshared: A First Nation's Language Program, A First Nation's Studies Program, AWilderness Outdoor Education Camp, A First Nation's Science and Technology Program,a First Nation's Cooperative Education Program, A Senior-Years Program, A Community-Based Adult Training Centre.Rebecca's article closes by describing the Seven Traditional Sacred Teachings,and processes of implementing education change that are responsive to culturaltraditions.The work of Paul Chartrand is represented in this text by transcriptionsof two watershed speeches he has made. The first \"An Absolutely Uncritical Look atWhat has been Written about the Metis\" is a tongue-in-cheek, yet scathing, critiqueof academia's past treatment of Metis culture and history. Chartrand highlights that theconstitutional Aboriginal rights of Metis peoples are enshrined in the Constitution Act of1982. Yet, blatantly prejudiced terms such as \"mixed bloods\" and \"half-breeds\" are seen to have made their way into scholarly writings of the 1980s. Such ignorance is contraryto current research on the complexity of genetic inheritance and the inadequacy ofblood-quantum in determining cultural identity (Schewich and is his recent opening address to theCanadian Bar Association and Indigenous Bar Association. He offers some insights intothe final report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, and related currentfederal responses. He notes that \"the litmus test\" for Canada's policy response to RCAPwould be the federal adoption of key recommendations regarding the accession ofAboriginal groups to nation status. He further notes that, to date, the federalgovernment has not held a forum to draw up a Canada-wide framework agreement toachieve these key recommendations.Chartrand does not aim to trivialize the important projects the government hasundertaken in response to RCAP (health care, youth centre development, and theHealing Foundation focus on Residential School abuses). Yet, he decries the furtherdevelopment of Aboriginal policy in bureaucratic isolation. He cites the recent federalattempt to \"exonerate\" Louis Riel through public poll, as an example of side-steppingAboriginal leadership. He urges that the RCAP be followed-up carefully so that questionsof identity of \"nations\" or \"peoples\" might properly be vested in the law of theConstitution, in the absence of case law.Chartrand very pointedly attacks the misconception that self-government wouldnecessarily accord special rights to \"racial minorities.\" Rather, he reinforces the RCAPview that \"Aboriginal peoples\" are comprised of distinct historic, social and politicalcommunities. He provides some concrete suggestions as to how Canada's legal systemmay now be able to democratically move beyond Lord Durham's conception of Canadaas \"two nations warring in the bosom of a single state\" toward a vision of a multinationalCanada.In \"Working for the Government in Indigenous Education:Strategic Planning in Current Maori Education in New Zealand,\" Rawiri Brellfocuses upon systemic policy development and implementation. He notes that, from abackground of intense colonization, the Maori and the New Zealand government arecurrently attempting to address past injustices in an environment still suffering fromunsettled treaties, poverty, unemployment and poor housing. 921 Brell describes major New Zealand research trends in addressing Maorieducation development, in the light of being in the difficult role of a Maori public servant.The main body of Rawiri's article is his overview of present day policyinitiatives, which reflect Maori communities' perceived priorities, coupled with a detailedaccount of a working strategic framework for change. This strategic approach will serveas a valuable reference for other national and Indigenous systems development. Brelldetails specific, vital commitments to making systemic change: good communicationpractices, refining processes of policy development, ongoing evaluation of existing policyeffectiveness, organizing long-term links between Maori communities and governmentdepartments, and achieving overall social policy coherence.Within a more coherent social policy framework, Brell sees the likely refinementof school support, the raising of Maori student achievement, and the more conscientiousmeeting of treaty resolution expectations.Marlene Brant Castellano's paper is entitled \"Education andRenewal in Aboriginal Nations: Highlights of the Report of the RoyalCommission on Aboriginal Peoples.\" It contains a succinct overview of the mandateand overall thrust of the RCAP recommendations. This work is particularly clear indescribing the central role of various education processes to achieve positive growth inFirst Nations' governance, cultural renewal, and economic well-being. Brant Castellanofurther underscores the vital importance of educating the general Canadian publicregarding RCAP recommendations in order to establish a renewed relationship withMetis, Inuit and First Nations communities. Lastly, the author briefly describes currentFederal action and laments the scale of the effort in that milieu, and among FirstNations, in order to proceed to realize a true partnership.The traditional Indigenous process of reaching consensus mayerroneously be construed as an inefficient, time-consuming \"nicety\" that is unnecessaryin the 21st century. However, the \"Declaration Affirming the Principles forIndigenous Education and Self-Government\" was arrived at consensually by thegathered delegates of the \"Voice of the Drum\" in a timely manner. Simply, thedevelopment of deep trust, intense communication of ideas, and reliance upon selflessleadership in formulating a declaration were understood by the over two hundredparticipating delegates to be achievable within the eleven days of the gathering. The 2210 four directions of the Principles of Indigenous Education were thus set out to be: self-determination, earth renewal, restoration of civilization, and the active formation ofpartnerships.IVREFLECTIONSThe summative reflections of a respected Elder and the visionary insights of ananonymous participant of the \"Voice of the Drum\" complete this book.

Trudeau, who, through his patience andknowledge of our Odawa language, supported and helped with the homeschooling andupbringing of our eldest daughter, Elizabeth.Circular VisionVisual perception or human perception can be described in two ways. The firstkind of vision is called linear vision, which is seeing and interpreting with a 'straightahead vision' or a hundred and eighty-degree vision. Those artists who function withlinear vision view the world through the elements of design, line, shape, colour andtexture.In this article, I will speak about circular vision from a Native perspective usinga culture-based homeschooling curriculum that was used for homeschooling on theWikwemikong Unceded First Nation during the early years of 1990. The child, Elizabeth 1325 A. Trudeau, Anishinabe name \"Binaasiikwe,\" dodem Fish clan, is the daughter of Marieand Wilfred A. Trudeau. She was homeschooled from first grade up to half a year ofsecond grade as a result of a lack of vision quest teachings, fasting teachings, Nativelanguage scroll teachings, and sweatlodge teachings being absent in the provincialschool system on the reservation. The parents, Marie and Wilfred, wanted theirdaughter, Elizabeth, to experience her first vision quest before she was allowed into theregular provincial school system. Although the First Nation had been given control oftheir own education system, the opposition from the Catholic Church and some of thepeople in leadership positions on the reserve was, and still is, an obstruction. As well,some parents are still opposed to our sacred ways and some of the reasons areunknown at this time, perhaps, resistance to change may be a common cause.Marie and Wilfred know from their own experiences of vision questing,sweatlodges and listening to the scroll teachings in their Native language that, in orderfor one to apply the sacred teachings of our ancestors to their lives, they must feel thoseteachings. It is not enough to hear and read about them in the school and the churchsystem, but, as Anishinabe, we must also feel them through vision questing.Vision questing or seeing through a three-hundred and sixty-degree vision, is acomplete way of seeing or viewing the world. If one experiences and understands therelationship to the natural world, its physical reality as well as its spiritual being, then itis a total way of seeing. Although many myths and legends have been recorded, writtendown and studied, they have not been understood by those who function with linearvision. One of the reasons for this is the lack of understanding of the Native languageused by elders to tell these stories. These stories have been written down in the Englishlanguage and they have lost their meaning. However, when the same stories arespoken and heard in the Native language, they carry a powerful meaning. As anexample, in the sacred lodges of Native people, when a scroll teaching is given in theNative language, it is so powerful, so great, so enlightening that it may cause one to cry.They are not crying because they received a teaching, but they are crying because ofthe power they have received in the scroll teaching in the Native language.Native language begins very early in birth when the baby is still in the womb ofthe mother. Beginning from childhood, a baby is an inquisitive human being with allsorts of needs. As we all know, a baby's development is a continuous process, whetherit be the development of the body or the development of the personality. The story ofthis little human being does not start at five years or two, or at six months, but starts at2614 birth and before birth. This is why Native women sing sacred ceremonial songs to theirbabies while carrying. Within these songs is the Native language and, as mothers, webegin the process of instilling our mother tongue into our children. Before birth, whenthe baby is still in the womb, she is a human being, and by the time the baby is born,she will have a great deal of learning experience, whether it be pleasant or unpleasant.The baby has shared your meals of wild meat and wild berries, and she has knownwhenever you were anxious, excited or angry. If you have been restless, she hasbecome used to movement. On the other hand, if you were a restful sort of person, shehas known peace.Shortly after birth, culturation begins as early contact between mother andchild helps to lay the foundation for the child's personality, emotional development, andher capacity to withstand the frustration and shocks that will follow. In the Anishinabeworld, the grandmothers and aunties encourage their daughters to place the child in aT'kanagan (cradleboard) in order for the child to feel secure, and its afterbirth is buried(Manitowabi, 1987).Each family member has a place within the family. The family, which is wheremost of us receive enrichment and harmony of our nature and spirit, is usually where wereceive our human life and thought. It is through our families where we fulfil our needsfor identity, relatedness, intimacy and growth, in addition to our most deeply humanqualities. These qualities must be nurtured from the time a child is still inside the wombup until the time when he/she is ready to leave the family. A family is where most of usspend most of our lives. There is our family of origin and, as we marry and havechildren, then our grandchildren and their children will continue the chain of familysystems. On and on through life, the family is where the influence of our culture andcustoms are carried on.Elizabeth's family consisted of a mother and father, grandparents on both sidesof the family, aunties and uncles. Her family lived according to what bare necessitieswere available. They live in a one-room living room, kitchen and dining area with twobeds upstairs in the loft of their cedar log home. She was able to feel a sense ofbelonging and a sense of meaning. Elizabeth's family believed that clothes did not makea person, but were worn for comfort. Food resources, some of which came from thefood market, were obtained through planting and gathering.Elizabeth's father made her first cradleboard. \"The material used to make thecradleboard is pine that has been struck by lightning\" (Gillman & Morey, 1974). The father must look for a certain type of tree in the mountains or on the hill. A certainamount of material is cut from the trunk of the tree and the tree is allowed to heal itselfof the cut. The whole tree is not cut down; only the amount needed is taken in order toconserve the tree. The tree will continue to grow. According to a well-respected elderfrom the Garden River First Nation in Ontario, Dan Pine, \"before a person goes out tocut the amount he needs for the cradleboard, he must do a ritual\" (1986). When thecradleboard is finbiihfather hangs a cane, spider's web and a small bundlecontaining the baby's umbilical cord. When the baby notices these items hanging on thecradleboard, the parents are to talk to the baby to explain the reasons for the canehanging in front of the baby. Talking to your babies is very beneficial and creates thebonding that is needed between mother and child. The cane symbolizes the life cyclefrom birth to an elder and is placed on the cradleboard so the child will live to be an oldperson. In addition to the cane is a spider's web which is a protector from evil; evilssuch as other peoples' jealousies, evil thoughts and negativities.The third object on the hanger is the pouch containing the umbilical cord of thechild. This pouch or cord symbolizes the relationship between mother and child. Theumbilical cord is buried between birth and seven years old and it symbolizes that thechild is from Mother Earth. It is explained to her that her real mother is Mother Earthand that the physical mother, which is ourselves, are just teachers, who guide and carefor the child (Bisson, 1993). An eagle's head was carved on Banaasiikwe's cradleboardto symbolize her Anishinabe name, which could mean one or two ways of saying it: LittleThunderbird girl or little girl of the Thunderbird. In addition to her Anishinabe name, herfather's Anishinabe name is also carved in it and her mother's clan. By placing the babyin a cradleboard, we are instilling security in the baby because the baby feels as thoughhe/she is still in the womb. It is a gradual introduction into the universe of human life.Elizabeth received her first experience of human love with her mother andfather and within her family. It is here with her mother, and within her family, that shelearns how to love. Once she has learned to crawl off her mother's lap and is able towalk around by herself, she soon finds that she is on her own to make her owndecisions, always with the advice of her parents, aunties, uncles and grandparents. Ifshe toddled up to a fire and was about to put her hand on a hot coal that would hurther, she would hear \"Shhh,\" warning her not to do it. As any baby does, she would lookat her parents first and then at the coal again, trying to decide what to do. If shedecided to touch the coal and got burned as a result, she would soon learn to listen to 1628 that \"Shhh.\" She made the decision to touch the coal and, in addition, she was notforced. Therefore, one who makes his/her own decision to do something always does itbetter than one who is forced to do something.Eventually, as the child begins to talk, it is the language, as mentioned bySamples (1976) in his book, \"which introduces the child to its first cultural discovery,\"and, therefore, language is the first cultural influence. By learning language (forexample its words, its structure, its grammar, and its feelings), the child begins toexperience learning the traditional stories of a culture. The child begins to pronouncethe words in the home and grows with the Native language.The sacred lodges, such as the sweatlodge, the ceremonial lodge, the moonlodge, are some of the great stepping stones for Native people to use as classrooms inorder to begin the process of teaching the young about their culture. To be able to takethe children and students out of the normal setting of a classroom and bring them outinto a circular natural setting is an advantage in learning. It has always been the originalway that our ancestors have taught us. One of the units that was designeddemonstrates this.Elizabeth, along with her parents and some local Wikwemikong bandmembers, constructed a Midewiwin Lodge and sweatlodge near the home where theactual homeschooling occurred. This provided hands-on learning for Elizabeth as shewas able to practice her role as a young girl and her place in lodge building. During thelodge building, she was required to wear a skirt and it was explained to her that her roleas a female was important in the lodge.Midewiwin, which simply means \"good-hearted way,\" once flourished inWikwemikong, however, with the encroachment of another religion, some of our peoplewent underground and did not practice their rituals any longer. A more detailed versionof Midewiwin may be researched in the \"Seventh Annual Report, Bureau of AmericanEthnology, Washington, 1891.\" A subject area of Marie and Wilfred's homeschoolcurriculum entitled \"Ceremonial Behaviour\"consisted of teaching Elizabeth appropriatebehaviour around the sacred lodges of the Midewiwin and other sacred lodges such asSundance, Raindance, etc. She was taught that, in following the Midewiwin Code ofLife, one must be careful in how she speaks to another and to speak with kindness. Tobe rude, boastful and unkind is inappropriate of a Midewiwin person. She was taught topray for the water at ceremonies and that water is sacred, and to give thanks for its helpin the healing of the people through the sweatlodge. It was explained to her why thefirepit is in the shape of the crescent moon and why cedar is placed upon the alter of the pit. She was given the opportunity to place the cedar upon the pit. She was trained towear skirts and dresses upon entering the Midewiwin Lodge. Early discipline at such ayoung age enabled training and responsibility to occur. We have a kind way of disciplineif we are given the chance. Another area of the curriculum was \"Prophecies\" wherebyElizabeth learned about the seven prophecies of Three Fires Nation Ojibwa, Odawaand Pottawatomi (Benton-Banai, 1982). Vision Quests, Clans/Dodems, FastingTeachings, Bear Teachings, etc. were taught under this area. She was taught how togive a teaching in her own Native tongue as this is how we were instructed in theoriginal teachings. Elizabeth's clan, which is that of the Fish clan, was explained to her.Some of the areas of her Science curriculum centered upon the Clan/Dodaem System.This system, which we believe the Creator gave to the Earth's original people, theAnishinabe, was once used to govern the Three Fires people.Part of the word itself \"do-do\" in our Native language is a word that means\"breast\" (Eshkibok, 1986). Elizabeth was taught that, as Anishinabe, we do not call it aclan but dodaem. The Great Law of the \"O-do-i-daym-i-wan\" was given to Anishinabe asa way of sacred knowledge. It was a system of government whereby we maintained ourindividual and collective identity. This is why we lived in harmony with one anotherduring the days of our ancestors, because each and every one of us knew our dodaemresponsibilities. For example, the Bear Dodaem people knew it was their responsibility tohave knowledge of the medicines, because the bear spent most of its time encircling andprotecting the village. Because they did this, they studied the medicines. Women of anytribe knew it was their responsibility to cook for feasts within their village or communityand did not wait to be told to do so. Some of the men's responsibilities included lookingafter the sacred fire, looking after the tobacco, etc.The Native people who are of the fish dodem were known as the philosopherswho were seekers of truth and found answers. In addition to this, they knew when thetides would rise at the full moon; and, they knew when the maple sap water wouldbegin to flow just by looking at the position of the big dipper in the sky (Memagos,1989). They knew what was happening in the sky and water world, and they were alsovery intellectual people.As part of her curriculum studies on animals, my daughter was taken on fieldtrips to see live animals at the Toronto Zoo and other zoo areas within Ontario.Elizabeth was given a small portion of the Bear Story to learn in the Odawa language (Video, Assembly of First Nation, 1991). She was also taught that it is not the GroundHog who comes out during the February moon, but it is the Bear. This is the reasonwhy this moon is call \"Makwa Giizis\" (Bear Moon). An elder, Silas Fisher from WalpoleIsland, who has since passed on, carried this important part of our history.Elizabeth's first language in the home was the Odawa language and she wasencouraged to speak her Native tongue during home instruction. Basic instructionallanguage was used in the home in order that she may grasp the words and begin to usethe Odawa language. As an example, if it was time to eat, \"Wiisinaadaa\" which means\"Let's eat.\" The child begins to associate the word with the behaviour when the familysits down to eat after the instruction in the Native language.One of the objectives of the homeschool curriculum consisted of narratingpersonal vision quest experiences. This specific objective is what is missing in our bandoperated schools and is of the greatest importance in order for our children to begin theprocess of feeling those sacred gifts of humility, honesty, love, etc. Elizabeth wasprovided hands-on learning whereby she was involved in the actual building of her ownfasting lodge. A fasting lodge was built outside near her home. At the age of seven, shewas taught that she must experience those sacred gifts of humility, kindness, love, truth,honesty, respect and wisdom. It is not enough to hear or read about them in school,but she must also feel those sacred gifts through a vision quest. An example of this iswhile sitting upon Mother Earth, one can feel pity and humility for a drooping flower whomust wait for it to rain. The flower that is thirsty and the one fasting is also thirsty, atthe same time can feel that gift of humility for one another because they are boththirsting for that sacred waterlife. Elizabeth was prepared for a one-day and one-nightfast, as part of her training at the age of seven years. At this stage in the child's life,mentally, emotionally, and physically, it is said that the child is ready to leave themother's side and attend school to meet the new school teacher, principal, janitor, andwhomever the child will encounter in the new school setting. First of all, preparationincluded preparing her body. She was allowed to sleep on the floor of her bedroom inorder for her to become accustomed to the hard ground upon Mother Earth. Elizabethtravelled to many pow-wows during the summer months and received a large amount oftraining by camping outdoors.She was trained not to be afraid of the dark and night creatures by taking walkswith her mother or father at night so she would become familiar with darkness. She wasnot permitted to view horror movies or violent movies for this may discourage her from 1931 fasting for the new life.It was at this time in a child's life where the child is taught toput away her teddy bears and that it is only babies and infants who play with teddy beartoys. She is also instructed to put away her terrible-two behaviour of whining and beingrebellious, for to carry this kind of behaviour into adulthood is inappropriate. To be alittle girl in an old woman's body or a little boy in an old man's body is not verybecoming of a young woman or young man in the Anishinabe world. This one day visionquest fast is to help the young child move from the stage of infancy into childhood. It isalso a time when the child learns to let go of her mother, and the mother also learns tolet go of her child when the child is put out into the bush to be cradled by Mother Earth.The child is taught that the physical mother is not his/her real mother, but only themother who cares, teaches, and guides the child. The child learns who its real mother isand that is Mother Earth. She begins the process of learning to respect the earth for itsteachings and spirituality. Mother Earth is the child's first teacher and all things uponMother Earth are considered sacred. Mother Earth must be treated with respect andkindness as our Mothers and Grandmothers for they are life carriers who bring new lifeinto this universe.The sacred Grandmother teaching talks about the traditional law that theCreator gave to Grandmother Moon (Bisson, 1999). Elizabeth was also taught that shemust fast where she grew up and came from, because the animal spirits know her in herown home setting. She was warned not to go fasting elsewhere for the animal spirits ina different area may become angry with her during her vision quest (Beaucage, 1990).This is the very first stage of a child's life in the Anishinabe world. It is known as thepreparation of life because we, as parents, are preparing that child for the road ahead.Another part of the curriculum that was used to teach language was singinglodge songs. When Elizabeth and her mother readied the lodge for ceremonies, or whencleaning the lodge after a ceremony, they would sing songs in their Native Odawalanguage. Other ways and means of learning songs occurred during the times whenriding in their vehicle. It is very easy for our children to remember their Native languagethrough songs. These songs carry great meaning and the connection is there betweenour Native language songs and our spirituality. There are water songs that are thewomen's responsibility (Manitowabi, 1989). These songs were explained to the child insuch a way that each syllable was pronounced in order that the child may grasp itsmeaning. These songs were sung with truth and were used to express oneself, and onecan feel the spirit within the song. There is also a proper way to sit in the ceremonial lodge. One side of the lodgebelongs to the men and the other side belongs to the women (Benton-Banai, 1989).Other responsibilities of women and girls in the lodge include cooking, gathering cedar,and ensuring that there is water to fill the sacred vessels. During a ceremony, Elizabethwas allowed to practice her responsibilities as a young girl, something which she isunable to do in the regular band operated school system.All in all, today, Elizabeth has completed two movies, one of which she took thelead acting role. In addition to this, she is a hoopdancer, a jingle dress dancer, and is anexcellent teacher in facilitating cultural workshops. She continues to fast annually in thebush. As a result of beginning her menstruation cycle, she is presently on herStrawberry Fast and, after one year, she will graduate to two days of fasting. She is alsoa carrier of the Buffalo Dance Teaching which talks about a young woman's sacredness.Elizabeth has hopes and dreams of continuing on with her acting career, however, sheis also looking at the field of Psychology and in helping her people through spirit, body,and mindNative psychology. As parents dedicated to the preservation and thepractising of our Odawa way of life, this experience of homeschooling our eldestdaughter has given us a feeling of accomplishment in this earth life, and it makes us feelgood to know that she will carry this with her for the rest of her life and that it willalways be a guiding force in her life. It has also strengthened us, as parents, inpractising our Aboriginal rights in educating our own child in the original manner thatwas given to us by the Creator. It is also a reminder to our Native educators to look atan original learning style that was there in the beginning and to begin the process ofsomehow incorporating this into our own band operated school system for those parentsand children who seriously want this for themselves. To be able to nourish that part ofour mental and emotional self through vision questing is an important part of ourhealing. Nourishing that beautiful gift of life that the Creator has given to man andwoman is something to cherish forever, and our children will always be thankful to us forwhat we have done for them in this earth life. They will know how to carry those sevensacred gifts in a sacred manner honesty, love, kindness, humility, truth, respect andwisdom. BibliographyBeaucage, Benjamin.

I will explore the thesis that, although in the 1980s Canadaeliminated the blight of residential schools for Aboriginal children, many of the featuresof colonization, deracination and assimilation continue today through the medium of ourprison system. This is especially devastating in view of the fact that so many youngAboriginal people are growing up and acquiring their education within the walls ofCanadian prisons.BackgroundCanada's history of colonization and the attempted assimilation of Aboriginalpeoples is similar to that of many other countries, including Australia, New Zealand,Africa and the Americas. It is not a history of which we can be proud. In Canada, itcreated a shocking third-world lifestyle for many Aboriginal people.Taking the province of Manitoba as an example, we can refer to the finding ofThe Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry (Hamilton and Sinclair, 1991). In 1991, theauthors reported that the average income for a status Indian in Manitoba was $10,672,compared to $16,796 for the province as a whole. In Winnipeg, over half of theAboriginal population was living below the poverty line, compared to 20% for non-Aboriginals. With respect to housing, only 34-44% of Aboriginal people had indoorplumbing and 40% had central heating, compared to 94% and 82% of the generalpopulation, respectively. Housing was found to be generally crowded and inferior.In Canada, more generally, the unemployment rate for Aboriginal people todayis four times that for non-Aboriginals. Life expectancy is much lower for Aboriginals 7to 8 years lowercomparable to the life expectancy rate for Nicaragua (Charleson,1998). The death rate for Aboriginals between the ages of 25 and 44 is five times that 23 for non-Aboriginals. The suicide rate is more than double. Infant mortality is higher(1.7 times). Dietary problems are much more prevalent. And whereas 8%of theCanadian population relies upon some type of social assistance, 29%of AboriginalCanadians must do so (Charleson, 1998).Politics: HistoryIn Canada, the Constitution Act1867and the Indian Act 1876 gave the federalgovernment total control over all matters affecting Indians. The legislation madeIndians wards of the state.All aspects of their lives were controlled by the state, fromcradle to grave. They were placed on small, unproductive reserves, and forbidden topractice their culture. Infractions reaped jail sentences.For many decades during this century, Aboriginal people were forbidden by lawto pursue their legitimate land claims (by legislation which made it illegal to raise moneyfor this purpose). Although many Aboriginal people fought in two World Wars forCanada, they did not obtain the right to vote federally until 1960. As recently as 1968(with the infamous White Paper of Jean Chretien, now Canada's Prime Minister), theofficial federal policy towards Aboriginal people was one of assimilation.Politics: PresentToday, despite many efforts to repeal the Indian Act, Aboriginal people are stillgoverned by this paternalistic legislation. The reserve system still exists, although manyAboriginal people have made their way to urban centres. Efforts at decolonization arebeing made, and there is a new effort to assert autonomy and to fight for self-government. Land claims are being settled with glacial slowness, due mainly to therecalcitrance of provincial and federal governments. As well, many First Nations arestruggling to exercise their rights under various treaties signed over the last century.This has presented special problems, with even the United Nations expressing concernsover the methods and bad faith of the Crown, both then and now.All of this has been complicated by the fact that there are 633 distinct bands inCanada, with many discrete languages and cultures. As well, in the struggle forautonomy, Aboriginal women are fighting to reassert their own traditional role which, atone time, commanded respect within the culture.Residential SchoolsA particular blight upon the Aboriginal landscape in Canada was theestablishment of residential schools. The Indian Act(s. 114)and the various treatiescontained promises by the Crown that it would provide education to Aboriginal people.3624 In partnership with the churches, then, the government established 80 residentialschools. Although some children had good experiences with these schools, the vastmajority had experiences which left a terrible legacy of abuse, both physical andemotional (Grant, 1996; Haig-Brown, 1993). So extreme was the situation in theseschools that the United Nations is today investigating and documenting the varioushuman rights violations which took place there (Matas, 1998). The last of these schoolswas finally closed in 1988. 125,000 Aboriginal children in all have passed through theirdoors.The stated purpose for these schools was to remove Aboriginal children fromtheir culture and to replace their culture and values with those ofEuropeans/Whites/Christians. This was a deliberate and concerted attempt atassimilation, and some would say genocide. The method employed was to remove(forcibly if necessary) children from their families and villages, and to take them oftenhundreds of miles away for ten months of the year. Parents were thus unable to visit(especially during the time of the \"pass system,\" which kept Aboriginals on reservesunless they had express permission of the Indian agent), and the children lived lonely,desperate lives in an alien and sometimes brutal environment.Grant (1996) and Haig-Brown (1993) both document that, within residentialschools, European culture was dominant, and racism among staff was rampant. Thepurpose of the schools was to destroy a culture for which the authorities had nounderstanding or respect. The materials and subjects studied were designed for and bynon-Aboriginals without regard for cultures, histories or realities of Aboriginal life.Aboriginal spirituality, particularly, was banned and described as evil. The speaking ofAboriginal languages was banned; infractions of this rule were severely punished, and allteaching was done in the children's second language. The children suffered fromextreme isolation, and were totally separated from any hope of cultural transmission.Siblings were even separated from each other.In these schools, the particulars of Aboriginal culture were despised anddenigrated. Children were forced to give up their own clothing and to wear uniformsand numbers rather than names. Their braids, a source of pride in their culture, werecut off. The school system was completely hierarchical in the European fashion, andthere was no inherent respect for children, as there is in Aboriginal culture. NoAboriginal foods were allowed in the schools. None of the traditional celebrations wereallowed. Sun Dance, Thirst Dance, all were disallowed and replaced with European-style 25 sports. Finally, there was thedenigration of women who had traditionally been therespected keepers of Aboriginal culture.One child said of his experience at residential school: \"We were not to think oract or speak like an Indian. And ... we would go to hell and burn for eternity if we didnot listen to their way of teaching.\" Religion was used \"as a weapon in the attack ontraditional native spirituality\" (Haig-Brown, 1993).Chief Florence McLean (1998), Chairperson of the First Nations Women'sCommittee, Association of Manitoba Chiefs, put it this way:The churches and the government of Canada stole our children away, stole ourreason for living, then they returned them to us as strangers for two months,only to take them back for another year, to ingrain into them that our culture isnothing but pagan, worthless, simplistic and primitive, among other things.Our treasures, our hope, our future were thrown into a foreign system wherethey were belittled daily, as well as forced to endure various types of abuses.Many were broken in mind, body and spirit.When Prison is a SchoolToday, the residential schools are closed. However, large numbers ofAboriginal children and youth are receiving an \"education\" of a very questionable kindwithin the European institution of the prison. And, within these institutions, many of thesame tools of colonizationand assimilation exist.Aboriginal people are seriously over-represented in Canadian jails. The AJIReportdocumented that, in Manitoba, although only 11.8% of the population wasAboriginal, over half of the jail population was Aboriginal. Among incarcerated youngoffenders, 61% were Aboriginal, and among women, 67%. Aboriginal people obtainedbail less often, spent more time in pre-trial custody, were more than twice as likely to besent to jail, and received sentences about 2 1/2 times the national average. In 1988, ofthe 235 Aboriginal persons in the highest level of secure custody in Canada, 150 were inthe province of Manitoba (Hamilton and Sinclair, 1991).The All Report recorded systemic racism within the justice system as the mainexplanation for these numbers. At the same time, the Chief Justice of the provincevehemently denied that this was the case. A couple of personal anecdotes may help toillustrate the degree of racism existing within the systemas defence counsel, Ihaverepresented many Aboriginal people. In one case, two young women were caughtshoplifting and brought before the court. They had taken some clothing for the baby.They had no criminal records at all. They pleaded guilty and were sentenced to jail. In 3826 a second case, a young woman bounced a fifteen-dollar cheque. She was arrested andincarcerated overnight to await a bail hearing the next day. She, too, had no criminalrecord. The charge was eventually dropped. All three of these women were visiblyAboriginal, with recognizably Aboriginal surnames. None of them, I believe, would havespent any time in custody had they been non-Aboriginal.We can expect the trend of over-representation in jails by Aboriginal people tocontinue unless there is some serious intervention. In 1998, 56\u00b0/0 of Aboriginal peoplewere under the age of 24 (Charleson, 1998), and since most crime is committed byyoung men between the ages of 15 and 24, it is likely that the over-representation ofAboriginal people in jail will continue. It is also at this very age that we would expect tosee these young people receiving their schooling. Instead, they are becoming trapped,often irrevocably, in the criminal justice system. Thus, for a large segment of theAboriginal population, jail becomes a substitute for school. And like the schools ofyesteryear, it becomes an instrument for deracination, abuse, and assimilation.The parallels are astonishing. Just as in the residential schools, Europeanculture dominates in the prison system and there is racism among staff. There has alsohistorically been little respect. for Aboriginal culture, although steps are being takentoday to introduce sweats, to permit medicine bags, and to encourage elders toparticipate in the counselling of inmates. Aboriginal spirituality has, until very recentlybeen, denied within the prison system. Even today, Aboriginal languages may bebanned in the prison setting (The All Reportrefers to recent threats of punishment inthe Agassiz Youth Centre of Manitoba against Aboriginal children for speaking their ownlanguage). Prisons provide the same extreme form of isolation which was experiencedby children in residential schools, often similarly removing them hundreds or thousandsof miles from their homes. Aboriginal dress is not generally allowed in prisons, anduniforms are the order of the day. There is no Aboriginal food. There are no Aboriginalfeast days. Women are denigrated, and there are few female role models.Often, programs within the prison also contribute to the continued destructionof Aboriginal culture. One program called Teen Challenge is now operating within someManitoba prisons. Teen Challenge is a drug rehabilitation program based uponfundamentalist Christianity.It bans the practice of Native spirituality within theprogram, and preaches that such spirituality (according to one young graduate) is \"theoccult.\" This conservative evangelical group will not accept any approach which is notBible-based (Teen Challenge; Charette, 1998). 273 9 This type of approach causes problems when applied to Aboriginal prisonpopulations. First of all, the program directly challenges the value of Aboriginal culture.For example, in one case in Ontario, a young Aboriginal took an eagle feather andmedicine bag to the live-in Teen Challenge program. These sacred items wereconfiscated. As well, there is a coercive quality to the program one young offenderwas recently offered his release from the Manitoba. Youth Centre dependent upon hisparticipating in the Teen Challenge program on the outside.Any program which succeeds in treating a young person's drug dependency isto be commended for that success. However, as officials with the Native AddictionsCouncil say, Aboriginal drug addicts can actually be harmed by attending such a programif it makes them ashamed of their heritage. Despite the controversy, though, theManitoba government has provided Teen Challenge with $375,000, and the City ofWinnipeg $100,000, to assist them to open up a centre in Winnipeg.Jails do other serious harm to the culture of Aboriginal offenders. The criminaljustice system which places them there is completely alien to the Aboriginal culture(Ross, 1996). It is confrontational, hierarchical and adversarial. The emphasis is onpunishment, and not on healing or the restoration of harmony in the community. Thereis no effective input from the victim or the community at large. Consensus decision-making has no place in this system. Within the European system of punishment, there isno effort to \"complete the circle.\" Concepts of \"guilty/not guilty\" make no sense inmany Aboriginal cultures. The language barrier, too, causes problems in dispensing\"justice.\" At the end of a criminal court case, there is virtually never any sense that anoffender has been properly shamed, and has paid the price, and that he should now beaccepted back into the community. Once in jail, under the European system, the stigmanever goes away. There can, therefore, be no healing (Schissel, 1994).In a very real sense, jail is a \"school\" for those compelled to attend. It is a\"tool of cultural assimilation\" (Hamilton and Sinclair, 1991). Ivan Illich has said thatprison is a high school for crime (Cayley, 1998). Metis Kathleen Makela (1998) saysthat:\"Justice\" or \"law\" for Aboriginal peoples in Canada is state-controlled violence.It began with residential schools and government policies of assimilation andcontinues today with the legal system. Prison has become, for Native men,what high school and college is for the rest of society. 40;28 ConclusionSome attempts are being made to address the issues raised here. In Manitoba,the new Aboriginal Ganootamaage Justice Services program has begun hearing cases. Itis hoped that this service will reduce recidivism rates among Aboriginal offenders. Here,and elsewhere in the country, alternative methods such as sentencing circles andcommunity conferencing are also being adopted.The Supreme Court of Canada recently described as a crisis the over-representation of Aboriginal people in Canadian jails. Together, we sincerely hope thatmore progress can be made to reverse the trend towards educating Aboriginalyoungsters in jail. ReferencesAyed, Nahlan. 1999.

I just sat down on my bed andcried. For the longest time I didn't move. Then I laughed at myself and Ireminded myself that I was only going to Guy Hill for the weekend not for tenmonths.\" Former Guy Hill Indian Residential School Student August 1997 In the summer of 1991, five former students of the Guy Hill Indian ResidentialSchool found themselves sitting together in a downtown restaurant in Winnipeg,Manitoba. Each member reported feelings of dread and malaise. Frank discussionsinvoked unpleasant memories of the residential school they had attended together in theearliest years of their lives. Unbeknownst to these adults, their impromptu discussionswould lead to yearly Healing Gatherings of former students of the Guy Hill IndianResidential School at the site of that infamous facility located some thirty-one kilometersnortheast of the town of The Pas, Manitoba.1997 marks the sixth year former students of the Guy Hill Indian ResidentialSchool have returned to that site where their youthfulness, innocence and identity asIndian People were all but obliterated. \"Of all the steps taken to achieve that goal [tomake Canada a non-Aboriginal, Christian community], none was more obyiously acreature of Canada's toward Aboriginal people, its civilizing strategy and itsstern assimilative determination than education\" (Royal Commission on AboriginalPeoples, vol. I, 1996, p. 333). This year, however, the return to Guy Hill was not at alllike those of former times, when the students were to be \"educated;\" this return trip wasa continuation of the former students' healing journey.The encampment at Guy Hill this year grew to thirty-five camps and theparticipants, including non-campers or those choosing to camp elsewhere, numberedsome one hundred and twenty individuals. Lighting and maintaining the Sacred Fire, 314 3 Pipe Ceremonies, victory songs, Sweat Lodge Ceremonies, Healing Circles, swimmingand feasting were amongst the daily activities. Later in the evenings, entertaining songsand stories were shared by the participants. The fog is clearing. I call it the 'Spider-Web,' you know. I never used to hugmy brothers and sisters ... I never even used to hug my own children because Iwas afraid I might be one of \"them,\" a pervert, but now ... after coming here, Ican hug my kids.\" Former Guy Hill Indian Residential School Student August 1997 (Excerpts from \"The Guy Hill Healing Journey,\" prepared by Ed Azure for theGuy Hill Healing Committee.)ProductionMisty Lake is based on the life of Elizabeth Samuel, a former student of theGuy Hill Indian Residential School in The Pas, Manitoba. We are dramatizing her storywith permission, and we thank her for the honour and privilege. Patty and Bird arefictional characters. We also want to thank Augustine for his stories.The first production of Misty Lake was at the Cinematheque Theatre inWinnipeg, Manitoba, July 1-10, 1999, with the following of Susan Olson and Dale LakevoldAll production rights for this play are held by Dale Lakevold and Darrell Racineof Root Sky Productions, 331B 9th Street, Brandon, Manitoba, R7A 4A8.MISTY LAKEPlace/Time:A house on a Northern Manitoba reserve. Mid-afternoon. Earlyspring. The present.Characters:Bird, 40, Dene; Mary, 43, Dene; Patty, 25, Metis; The drummer.Set:Mary's kitchen. Round wooden table with two chairs. Tape recorderand microphone. Papers and notebook. Three coffee cups. Brokenhockey stick. Two sets of rosary beads. :4 432 Sound/Music:As noted in the script.[Blackout. The drummer begins a song in the blackout. Lowlight fades up on the drummer][Patty enters. When the drum song ends, she speaks to theaudience. She's in the present]Patty:I'd been stuck on the reserve for three days. It was spring, but therewas still snow on the ground and ice on the lakes. It was my firsttime on a northern reserve, and I arrived there in a plane that lookedlike a flying cigar tube from the Second World War the Death Tubethey call it. You crawl into that cramped little compartment, and youstay there, strapped into your seat, flying and flying for an eternity,and all you can see is bush and snow. You don't know where you'regoing, and you don't know where in the hell you are when you finallyget there. All you know is that you're surrounded on all sides by bush,and there's no way out.So there I was in that strange place, a stranger, trying to get a radiointerviewon something I didn't know a thing about, on something Ididn't want to know aboutresidential schools and healing.One year later, I can look back and tell myself I was there for areason. On the third day, I got what I wanted. And what I needed.[She returns to the past]I've been sleeping over at Matilda Moose's place on the floor! Andmy back's killing me. This morning, I tried to roll up my bed, and itwas stuck. I had to use a knife to pry that foamie off the floor. That'sthe first time in my life that I've ever had to make my bed with akitchen knife.I haven't had a shower since I left the city. When I askabout a shower, they tell me to wait until the ice thaws. When I tellthem I'm Metis, they stare at me as if I've just flown in from Ox AssOutlet. When I mention Louis Riel and the Battle of Batoche, theythink I'm talking about some guy who's just had a fight with his wife.I was supposed to catch my plane out of here yesterday, but I missedit. Why? Because it came in an hour early. Who's ever heard of aplane coming in an hour early? I'd like to find the guy who sets the 33 schedules around here. I'd kick his ass good and tell him that, whereI come from, passenger planes don't leave without their passengers.That's why they're called passenger planes.So, here I amgetting ready for an interview, except that I don'thave anyone to interview. Right now, Mary's out helping someone.She's been out helping someone for three straight days now. Maybe Ishould just tell her that I'm the one who needs some help. Maybe,that way, I'd get an interview.God, I need a drink. Please. God. Wherever you are up there. Havemercy on me. Send me a drink. Just one stinking beer. Please.I had another dream about my grandma last night. We were in a cafeback home in the Turtle Mountains, and she was pointing at thiscouple over in the corner. They were sitting there at a table with theirheads in their hands. They were sick from too much drinking thenight before. My grandma pointed to them, and then she whisperedto me:\"Those are your parents.\"I never knew my parents. Not until I was older. I grew up with mygrandma. She died a month ago. And I keep dreaming about her.[Mary enters. She speaks to the audience]Last night, when I went to bed, my two girls were still up watchingN. At about four o'clock in the morning, I woke up with a dreamabout that dog of Henry Joseph's going after my two little ones. So, Ilooked down beside me, and they were asleep right next to me. Theywere safe, but the other two I didn't know about. When I got up, Ifound the back door wide open, and that dog was sitting there in theporch with his tongue hanging out.\"Go on, get out!\" I said to him. \"You're nothing but a nuisance!\"So when I went back in, who did I find but Shelley's boyfriend sittingon the girls' bed. I told him: \"Get the hell out of the house right now!You have no right to be here! It's four o'clock in the morning, so getthe hell out and take that dog with you!\"[Mary looks at Patty] Patty:Like I said, I've been trying to get this interview with Mary for threedays. And all she keeps telling me are these little stories about herkids and about her dreams and about this fish camp Misty Lake. Shetold me how she saved her boy one time from a monster in the bush.Another time, she told me how she'd been left for dead out on the iceone day. What does that have to do with healing[Patty and Mary say healing at the same time]Mary:Healing beginsPatty:Mary tells me.Mary:When you can talk about your life.[Patty and Mary sit down for the interview]Patty:Now you're sure we won't be interrupted this time.Mary:Nope. The kids are all in school, and I've got the whole afternoonfree.Patty:I mean, I just can't handle even one more interruption.Mary:I know thatPatty:And if I get on that plane without this interview, you know what myboss will say. He'll say, \"There's the door, Patty. That was your lastchance.\" I've been missing a lot of work lately, andMary:Don't worry. We'll do the interview and get you on that plane in time.I'll give you exactly what you need.Patty:Great. Okay, I just had to get that off my chest.Mary:That's good.[Slight pause. Patty wonders why Mary says \"that's good \"]Patty:So.[She collects herself, ruffles through her notes\"professionally,\" then starts the tape]Let's start with some background. First of all, can you tell us a littlebit about yourself?Mary:Well, I'm 43, and I'm the mother of 11 kids.Patty:11 kids? Holy shit, that's a lot of kids.Mary:Just a minute.[Mary shuts off the tape] 35 Are you supposed to be swearing on tape?Patty:Was I swearing?Mary:You said, \"Holy shit:\"Patty:Oh, jeez!Mary:That's okay.[Patty rewinds the tape and starts over]Patty:Now, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?[Bird enters without being noticed by Patty and Mary. Hesets a broken hockey stick against the wall. He stopsabruptly when he sees them talking. He follows theconversation very closely]Mary:I'm 43, and I'm the mother of 11 kids.Patty:Ho-ly, that's a lot of kids.Mary:I had twelve, but I lost one.Patty:So, when exactly did you have your first one? You must have beenpretty young.Mary:I was 16.Patty:Yeah, that's pretty young. And how old are they now?Mary:Well, the oldest is 26. And the next one is 24, and then the next onesare 22, 20, 19, 17[Bird is counting them off on his fingers]16, 14, 12, and 10. Is that 11?[Patty and Bird at the same time]Bird:That's only 10Patty:That's only 10Mary:BirdBird:Yeah?Mary:What are you doing here?Patty:Yeah, what's he doing here?Bird:That dog's outside again.Mary:Which dog?Bird:That dog of Henry Joseph's.Mary:Ohh, that damn dog 36 [She jumps up and rushes out]Patty:But waitMary:I'll be right backPatty:What about the interBird:She's just gonna chase that dog back to Henry Joseph's.[Patty groans]Patty:What's she doing that for?Bird:Oh, that dog just pisses everywhere on the house, in the yard, onthe woodpile. In fact, if you stand around too long in one place, youknow what he'll do?Patty:No. What'll he do?Bird:He'll piss on you.Patty:Oh, God. What's wrong with this place?Bird:I don't know. What do you mean?Patty:I mean, dogs don't normally go around pissing on people.Bird:Well, he's a mean old dog, and he hates strangers especially whiteones.[Bird points his finger at Patty]Patty:I'm not whiteBird:You're close enoughPatty:I'm MetisBird:Same thing. That dog can't tell the difference. He'll tear you apart,limb from limb.[Bird growls ferociously in Patty's face]With his bare teeth.Patty:Jesus, man, you don't have to breathe all over me.Bird:But, hey, don't worry. Just carry a big stick when you go out.Patty:For what?Bird:For pro-tec-tion. See that hockey stick?Patty:That's not a big stick.Bird:It's big enough. When he comes at you[Bird lunges at Patty with the stick]Just jab him between the eyes. He won't bite you then. \"Down, boy, down!\"Patty:Hey, put that stick down. You're liable to poke my eyes out.Bird:Rea -Ily? Hey, what's this?[Bird pokes at the tape recorder with his stick]Patty:It's a tape recorder. And it's an expensive one, too. So, stop pokingit.Bird:Oh, sor-ry.Patty:I'm doing an interview.Bird:Oh yeah, on what?Patty:Who knows?Bird:You're doing an interview, and you don't know what it's on?Patty:It's on resi-den-tial schools.[Patty shuts off the tape]Bird:Hey, don't shut it off.I could tell you a few stories about that.Patty:I'm doing the interview with Mary, and she's coming right back.Bird:You never know. You gotta fill that tape up with something. Don'tyou?Patty:Right.[She looks at Bird, thinking for a moment. She starts thetape]Okay, go ahead. Let's hear your story. It better be good.Bird:O -kay.[Bird rubs his hands together in anticipation. Patty turnsaway. When Bird doesn't say anything, Patty looks back.Bird is sittingthinking. Patty shuts off the tape]Patty:Well, are you gonna start that story or what?Bird:Just a minute, I'm thinking. What's your problem?Patty:No problem. I've got no problems at all. I've got all the time in theworld.Bird:That's good, cause so do I.[Patty checks her watch, annoyed][Bird stands up from the table. This is his moment. Heperforms his story with lots of energy and movement. He 38 speaks directly to the audience]Bird:This one time, they showed us a movie about Jesus, eh? And so thenext day, all the kids went around shouting, \"Hey, let's go play Jesus.\"They tell this one kid, \"Okay, you're gonna be the King of the Jews,eh. So we're gonna have to crucify you.\" Hey, I just thought ofsomething.Patty:What?Bird:You wanna be Jesus?Patty:No, I don't wanna be Jesus.Bird:You wanna do the crucifying then?Patty:No, I don't wanna do any crucifying unless it's you. Look, I'm justabout at the end of my ropeBird:Okay, okay. So they take some wood and they make a cross, eh.And, then, they make him carry it across the playground just likethis. Hey, you watching this?Patty:Yeah, yeah, yeah.[Bird turns back to the audience. He holds the hockey stickbehind his neck like it's a cross, his arms stretched out. Hewalks as though he's carrying a great weight]Bird:And then they start whipping him with willow branches Hey, aren'tyou gonna start whipping me?Patty:No, what are you? Nuts?Bird:Looks like I'm gonna have to do it all by myself.[He makes whipping sounds]Annhhhh![A whip]Unnnhhh![A whip]Ooonnh!And then they tie him to a tree. But, just then, the whistle blows[He whistles]and all the kids go running in.Patty:Why? What for? 39 Bird:They were going for lunch. Little kids get hungry, don't you knowthat?Patty:What, so they took off and just left him up there hanging?Bird:Yah, they left him up thereto suffer.[Mary enters. Bird and Patty can't see her. Bird is stillhanging on the crossto great effect]And there was no one there to comfort him[Mary washes his face and chest, his wounds. Bird respondsto her, although in reality she isn't there. Mary is helpingBird in the way that Bird helped that boy]He was crying when I found him all tied up to that tree, wearingthat crown of thorns.[Mary helps him down from the cross. She gives him thestick and backs away]Patty:Good thing you heard him crying, eh.Bird:Yah. He could've died on that cross. Just like Jesus. Them prieststold us that Jesus was a man who knew how to suffer, and they toldus to be just like him.Here. Feel this.[He forces the stick into Patty's hands. She holds the stick ina way that suggests it's going to be used for beating]They used to beat us with broken hockey sticks. With our own sticks.Just like that one there. And they used to shave our heads forgetting into mischief. You know why they used to do that? Tohumiliate us. To make us suffer.[Spotlight on Bird. He speaks to the audience]I used to think that place was haunted, that school. I used to have adream, this nightmare, about having no mom and dad.I'd get scared.And I'd wake up in the dark in the middle of the night.And I'd want my mom and dad. I'd want them there to hold me. Butthey were never there. Just like in my dream. I'd wake up, and I'dstill be in my nightmare. 4,40 My mom and dad took care of us really good, you know. They lovedus a lot. That was the hardest part. Being apart from your mom.That's what hurt the most.Cause that's where you come from, eh as an infant baby. You comefrom your mom.[The drummer enters. He kneels before Bird and sings ahealing song using a rattle. At some point in the song, Birdkneels. When the song is over, the drummer exits. Bird goesto Mary. She puts her hand on Bird's shoulder to comforthim. A tableau. Light returns. Patty turns off the tape. Shespeaks to the audience]Patty:My boss at the radio station told me before I came up that he wantedme to get something that would \"resonate\" with a wide audience. Iwant this interview to speak to that 42 year-old white, charteredaccountant who's sitting there with his hands behind his head going:[Patty looks at Bird]\"Okay. So? You've had a hard life. You've gone to residential school.You lost your childhood, your parents, your culture. So? What's thatgotta do with me? I never did anything to you.\"[Bird sees Patty]\"'Why don't you just go out and get yourself a frigging job, you bum?Instead of taking the taxpayers' hard-earned money\"Bird:I gotta go now.Patty:That's what I believeda year ago. For me, healing was somethingyou try to get your dog to do when you're out hunting: \"Heel, boy,heel.\"Mary:Bird, where you going?Bird:To get some cigarettes.Mary:Here. Get yourself a pack.[Mary sees the tension between Bird and Patty. Bird isglaring at Patty. Mary steps between Bird and Patty. Shegives him some money]And on your way out, can you set that pot of stew out to cool? I'll 4153 feed you when you get back.Bird:Okay, I will.[They watch Bird leave. Patty speaks to the audience]Patty:Bird left, and I could tell that he still had something more to say. Hewas a lot like me in that way he had things to talk about, but he hada hard time saying them. And then Mary started talking about thesister she'd lost at school. And it made me think about my own life.About losing someone precious, someone like my own grandma.[She sits down at the table and turns on the tape. She turnsto Mary as if she's just asked her a question. They are in mid-interview]Mary:I lost a sister there. She was only six years old just a baby. And Iwas only nine years old myself. The sad thing is, I felt that it was myresponsibility. You see, when mom sent us off to school, she took meout on a walkjust the two of usand she told me:\"Take care of your sister. Take care of her good.\"And that's what I really wanted to do.But that winter my sister got sick. I remember walking into thesanatorium with my sister.It was a strange place. We sat there forhours, just waiting and waiting. And when they finally took her in andwalked her down that long hallway, she started crying, and I couldhear her crying all the way down that long hallway. She looked sosmall and helpless. And when they turned that corner, I could hearher calling for me:\"Mary, Come and get me, Mary.\"I used to ask for her every day. And then they told me she'd passedaway.But then in Marchabout two weeks after they told me she'd diedthey told me she was still alive. So when I went back home, Igathered up all her stuff to take home with me. I took her clothes,her little things, her little bag made out of scraps of old jeans. Shehad a teddy bear, and I took that home, and when I ran up to mymom, I was holding that teddy bear: \"Mom, look I got her teddy '5 442 bear.\" But my mom never said a word.So, then I asked her:\"Where's my little sister?\"And my mom just looked away.That was at the end of June. And then in July, we heard she'd passedaway. My little sister. Just a baby.I knew my mom blamed me.Patty:Your mom blamed you?Mary:Yes. I didn't go back to school that fall. I went north instead with myparents, and my mom would take me out for long walks. I'd followher around in the bush, but it was like I wasn't there. She ignoredme. She was grieving for my sister. Late in November, it was gettingcold, and there was a lot of snow that year. I was trailing her in thebush one day. We must have walked for miles, and I was gettingreally tired.I remember sitting down in the snow, on my knees,calling her.I kept calling to her to wait, and she kept on walking.Like she didn't hear me at all.[She drops to her knees]'Mom. Come and get me, Mom.\"Finally, after about an hour, she came back. And that's when shecried. All those months she'd cry, but it was a silent cry. But thattime, she came back, and she cried. She just held me, and she cried.[Mary holds herself, rocking slightly. She finally gets up.Patty stands parallel to Mary. The song ends. They willspeak to the audience]Patty:I wanted to reach out and shut that tape machine off.I wanted to tellher to stop.I wanted to catch my plane and get outta there.Iwanted to leave, but I didn't want to go back home either. I didn'tknow what was wrong with me.[She takes out rosary beads from her pocket]The only thing I've got left from my grandma are these rosary beads.The ones she had at residential school. She never talked about itthat school. She only told me one story about it. 431.55 Mary:In the fall of 1965, I went back to the Guy Hill Indian ResidentialSchool in The Pas. During my years there, I felt a lot of pain. Atbeing taken away from my parents. Crying didn't help. When youcried, you were punished. You didn't have time to be lonely there.They didn't let you be lonely. Your feelings were your own, and youkept them inside. You never told anyone how you felt.Patty:It must have haunted her, my grandma. She told me about a six-year-old girl she knew at school. That girl was lonely, so lonely sheused to cry.Mary:We used to pray. We got up and we prayed. Before school, beforemeals, before bed, we used to pray.Patty:She used to cry and cry and cry.Mary:Pray and pray and pray.Patty:And finally one nightMary:What happened to that girl?Patty:One night, one of the nuns went up to that girl's bedMary:And what happened to that girl?Patty:She was crying and sobbing, and she wanted her mom, and that nun,that nun took that girl's pillowMary:And what did she do?Patty:She smothered that girl. To make her stop crying.Mary:To this day, I can't even bring myself to say: \"1\" believe in God theFather Almighty, maker of \"[Patty sets the beads down on the table. Mary pours coffeefor them. They sit down at the table. Mary picks up thebeads. By picking up the beads, Mary will be asking Patty aquestion][Patty drinks her coffee, preparing to speak. The coffee cupreminds her of her drinking]Patty:On the day of my grandma's funeral, I started drinking. Hard. Everyday after that. It was such a sad time, yet I didn't feel anything. Ijust looked at that coffin going down into the ground and walked awaywith those beads in my hand. 5.644 [Patty gets up from the table. She takes the beads with herand keeps them in her fist. She speaks to the audience]Right after that my uncles took me to the bar, and I met up with mydad there. He was drunk already. So, what the hell I starteddrinking to catch up with him. And everything that was wrong withmy dad and my life disappeared as the night went on. I felt like I waswith all my best friends. Drinking whiskey and telling stories. I wasslapping everyone on the back as if I'd known them all my life. Andeverything was just fine until that goddam Peter Jovanovich stood upand shouted at my dad:\"All you half-assed haltbreeds should go back to the bush where youbelong!\"And, that's when I snapped.'Peter Jovanovich, you dirty miserable bohunk. DI teach you to talkabout my dad like that! I'll send you back to Europe or wherever thehell you came from!\"I was the first one up to take a swing at that ditchdigger. I was there,on the front lines of Batoche, low on ammunition and high onwhiskey. I was leading a gang of fearless Metis rebels who all hadvisions of Christ that night.\"Come on, boys. The wages of sin is Death!\"The last thing I remember was steel bars and a cold concrete floor. Igot to know that floor real good that night. Every mark on that dirtyfloor. There in that cell.And when I finally came tomy head pounding and my guts burningupI opened my eyes, and there in my hand were my grandma'sbeads.[She opens her hand and lets the beads dangle]And that's where it began.Mary:That's where what began?Patty:The day of my grandma's funeral the day it all started coming back.All those years. All that hurt.[The sound of a dog barking fiercely. Bird rushes in] 455 7: Bird:That dog's got the stew!Mary:He's what?Bird:He stew!Mary:Where'd you put it?Bird:On that pile of woodMary:How'd he get up there?Bird:I don't !'now. He's a big dogMary:I know he's a big dogBird:He was standing on the woodpile, trying to get the lid offPatty:Why didn't you scare him off?Bird:I didn't have my stick. And he was growling.Mary:He's always growling.Bird:I tried to get that pot, but he was gonna bite my hand off.Mary:No, he just wanted that stew.Bird:No, he wanted my hand. And then he jumped down with it. He hadthe pot by the handle.Patty:What, in his paw?Bird:No, not in his paw. In his teeth. Like this.[He demonstrates]He went running down that road back to Henry Joseph's, carrying it inhis teeth.Mary:Well, don't just stand there. Go after him then.Bird:I am, I am. I'm gonna get that stew back![He grabs the stick and jabs it at Patty as if he's jabbing thedog]And I'll smoke that dog right between the eyes.[He's out the door]Mary:Wait, Bird. What about those smokes?[Bird pops his head back in]Bird:I don't have them.[He leaves are they?[He pops back in]5346 Bird:I don't know.[He leaves]Mary:What do you mean, you don't know?[He pops back in]Bird:I gave them away. I don't know where they are but, don't worry, I'llget that stew back.[Bird exits]Mary:I-yi-yi-yithat Bird and that dog are gonna put me in the grave yet.Patty:Yeah, and that's it for me. I'm done. Finished.[The light changes. Mary goes to the door to follow Bird'sexit. Patty starts shuffling her papers, putting them in order.She's getting ready to leave. Mary turns back and watchesher carefully. The drummer enters. He performs a song thatacknowledges Patty's state of mind her feeling of failureand pain. The drummer finishes and exits][Mary walks to the table. She picks up the rosary beads,thinking as she holds them. When Patty moves to get up,Mary stares at her until she slowly sits back down. The lightchanges back]Mary:Let me get some more coffee.Patty:But what about the plane?[Mary touches Patty's hand. Patty tenses and pulls her handaway. Mary touches Patty's hand again]I'll get more coffee.[Mary gets coffee]Patty:Something kept me there. Mary. Her touch. The way she touchedmy hand. I've never had anyone touch me like that before.[Mary returns and listens]I remember when I was a kid, lying in bed one night, under mygrandma's thick quilt, thinking about my parents: Where are they?Why can't they look after me? Why can't they be like other parents?My grandma loved me, but she never said it. She never hugged me.She never touched me. [Mary returns with coffee and sits]Mary:She grew up without parents. She never learned how to be close,how to touch someone. Her parents were priests and nuns. That'swho she learned from.Patty:I woke up every morning, thinking:\"I can't get up. I just wanna lie here and never get up.\"Mary:I useshave that same feeling when I was a girl at residentialschool. But I had a special place I used to go to. The hallway of thedorm.I used to do the polishing in there. I'd mop and then sweep and thenmop, and then I'd polish it.Every day. I'd make it shine, and I'd beproud of it.\"Look, I did that. That long hallway.\"And when I was going through my healing, my thoughts would goback to that place. Because I was safe there in that hallway. Therewas nobody there to tell me what to do. I knew exactly how thathallway was structured. I knew every scar on that floor. Which spotwould come out, which one wouldn't. But this is what was even moreimportant.I could make things better there.I was in another world in that hallway. A world that I could makeperfect again.[Pause]Patty:Perfect. Yeah, but how can you ever make things perfect again? Youcan't.Mary:That's true, but you can make things better if you talk about it.Patty:By talking about it?Mary:You can start healing those wounds. The whole story of my life, whenI look back, is very interesting. I can see it clearly now. I have abetter understanding of it. Why? Because I've tried to deal with it. Ihaven't kept it all hidden inside. I had to go through a lot of pain tobe able to sit here with you and talk the way I am about all that painand abuse. You can't be afraid or ashamed to talk about your life.Patty:I dunno. Why can't we just talk about something else?Mary:Like what? 6O48 Patty:I dunno. The good times. You must have a few good memories,don't you? Didn't you ever have any good times. Why can't we talkabout that?Mary:Sure we can. The best time of the year was when you were ready togo home. The kids would get so excited, they couldn't sleep. Someof our parents lived in Misty Lake, out in the fish camps, and theywouldn't be able to come and get you right away. So we'd have towait. Maybe they'd be coming in today or tomorrow, right afterdinner. It was like your mom and dad are camping over there bynow! And then your mom and dad are camping over here! I used tomeet them down at the lake, and that was the happiest moment,when the boats came in and you could run into the arms of your momand dad[The sound of a plane coming in]Patty:What's that?Mary:That's a plane.Patty:Don't tell me that's my plane.Mary:That's your plane.Patty:That's my plane?! It's two hours early!Mary:You're lucky it's in at all.Patty:I'm lucky it's in at all? What's that supposed to mean. I can't believeit.Everything's either two hours early or two hours late. Hasn'tanyone ever heard of a schedule around here?Mary:Look at it this way. If there's no schedule, then everything's on time.Patty:Everything's on time? Oh, my God, I can't stand it anymore.[She puts on her vest]Mary:You're leaving?Patty:Yes, I'm leaving.Mary:What about the interview?Patty:I don't care about the interview.Mary:What about your job?Patty:I don't care about my job. As a matter of fact, I don't care aboutanything right now. 4961 Mary:No?Patty:No.Mary:Why not?Patty:Well, because[She raises her arm angrily and accidentally flings her papersinto the air. The papers scatter. She throws up her arms]Shit!Mary:Looks like you need some help.Patty:Yes, I need some help. I need some help getting away from this hellhole!Mary:Yes, you better get back home where you belong.Patty:Home. I don't even have that.Mary:Why not?Patty:Because I left my family two weeks ago, that's why not.Mary:What happened?Patty:In the past month, I've lost my grandma, and then my husband, andmy kids.I might as well lose my job and make a clean break of it.God!Mary:Listen to you.Patty:What.Mary:You're no different from my kids.Patty:What do your kids have to do with it?Mary:You think I don't know you? I can tell you've had a rough life.Patty:Right.Mary:Maybe you grew up hating the fact that you were Metis a halfbreed.Patty:[No reply][She's making a poor effort to collect her papers]Mary:Maybe you were put down by the whites and ignored by the otherside. Maybe you still haven't dealt with it yet.Patty:I know what I've been through.Mary:But have you dealt with it?Patty:Yes.Mary:Have you? 250 Patty:Yes![Mary stands over Patty]Now, just get off my back! I've gotta catch my plane.[Mary waits]Mary:You've already missed it.Patty:Oh, God![Patty drops her papers again and sinks to the floor indespair, everything in chaos]Mary:Here.Patty:What?Mary:Get up.Patty:Can't.Mary:Yes, you can.Patty:No, I can't.Mary:Now, here. You can't go through life lying down like a whipped dog.Patty:I'm not a dog.Mary:No. Look at you. Here.[Mary pulls Patty up]Patty:Don't you quit?Mary:No. Never. Now, I'll tell you what I had to deal with. I'll tell youwhat I had to go through before I could sit down inside my ownhouse, and talk to you like this.[Mary takes out her rosary beads. She sets them down onthe table beside the beads of Patty's grandma]These are my beads from the residential school. And every time I putthose beads in my hands, it all comes back to me. Maybe it was thesame for your grandma. Maybe that's what she's handed down toyou. Her legacy from school.[Patty looks at Mary]Sit down, Patty. You came out of that system, two generations later.[She sits down reluctantly. Mary starts the tape]I'll tell you what it was like when I first got out. You have to re-learneverything.Patty:Like what? 516 Mary:Your relationships with your sisters and your brothers, your motherand father. You have to start over and learn everything becauseyou've never had a home.Patty:If you have to start over, then who teaches you?Mary:You teach yourself. Because our parents never talked. Did yours?Patty:No.Mary:My mom never talked to me about relationships. I didn't know how totake care of a baby. I was only 16 when I had my first baby. I criedwhen he was crying and needed a change of diapers. I didn't knowwhat to do. There was nobody around to teach me.Patty:So what about the father? What was he doing the whole time?Mary:He didn't know how to raise a family either. He grew up withviolence, thinking that was normal. So I found myself in a situationwhere I had to be abused. And it went on for years and years, andthat's when I started drinking. To cope. To numb the pain. Maybelike you've been doing?Patty:Me?Mary:By drinking?Patty:9[No reply]Mary:By leaving your home?Patty:[No kids ones who love you? Have youbecome your father?Patty:[No reply]Mary:I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying that's the way we copesometimes. I coped by drinking.Patty:And it was really that bad?Mary:It was really bad. I'd think: what's the easiest way to get out of thismess?Patty:*Suicide?Mary:I tried it once.Patty:And you lived.Mary:I had to. My kids needed me. But I'm lucky to be alive today because 6 452 you reach the point where you know your life is stake. How do youthink it feels to have someone pull out a .30-30 and point it at you,saying:\"One word comes out of you, and you're dead.\"Or to have somebody sitting there with a knife, a hunting knife, readyto slash your throat.Your partner knows he's losing control of your life. His \"possession\" isbeing violated. But he's not fighting the one he should be fighting.He's fighting the one he's trying to keep to the point where he'sready to kill you in order to keep you. If I didn't fight back, I wouldn'tbe here today.Patty:Why? What did you do?Mary:I stopped him.[A deep red light]I was getting ready to wash some clothes one day. He'd been outdrinking for a few days, and then he came back home and starteddrinking with his friends.I had a stove there, and I was heating upsome waterit was almost boiling. He asked me to go get him adrink, and I told him, \"No, you go get it yourself.\" Then he came upto the stove and took that boiling water and threw it on the floorright where the kids were playing. My little ones. I reached down andgrabbed them up, and then I chased everyone out of the house. Iwas screaming at the top of my lungs: \"Get out! just get out!\" I wasso angry with this man, who was inflicting abuse on me and now onthe kids.I was so blinded by my anger that I went after him.They took off on their ski-doos, but I knew where they were going. Iremember this one girl telling me, \"You scared me when you walkedinto that house. You had a knife in your hand.\" All she heard me saywas,\"Where is he?\"And she pointed like this into the living room, and I walked in there,and I took that knife, and I walked right up to him, right were he wassitting. He didn't move. He watched me coming, and I came up to 5365 him, my drunken husband, who tried to hurt my kids, and I stuck it inhim.[The light changes]He didn't die, and I didn't go to jail. But he knew he'd lost.I don't accept violence.I hate violence. But in the situation I was in,that's all I could do. If I'd listened to the stories and the teachings,maybe I could have done it differently. It was the start of getting out.I've had twelve kids, and I've had my home torn apart. I've seen theeffects of alcohol and abuse. I've had one sister die, a brother whowas murdered, and another one who committed suicide. I've had torelive that pain. I've had to suffer. But that's part of the healing.Healing is about learning how to suffer. You can never stop the paincompletely. You'll always experience pain and suffering. When you'redrinking. When you become violent. When you try to hide it all insideyourself, you're trying to stop the pain.Healing comes by telling your story to others. By doing that, you givepermission to others to do the same. What starts out as your ownstory becomes a story that belongs to someone else, like you.Right now, I need to know that everyone in my family is helping eachother. We have to respect each other and protect each other. Ifwe're going to survive, then someone has to set the path, someonehas to say: there's a way out.[The sound of the dog howling. Mary gets up to check. Birdenters, shirt torn. He has the stew and a tuft of dog fur]Bird:I got the stew!Mary:Looks like you got more than that.[Bird holds up the tuft of fur]Bird:Yeah, and I got some dog fur, too.[He throws it down]He got mad about that.Mary:I wonder why?Bird:Cause I just ripped it right out of him.Mary:Yeah, that would get him mad. 6654 Bird:Oh yeah, he was pretty upset.Mary:Guess he ripped your shirt, too.Bird:Yeah, he was trying to bite me.Mary:I can see that.Bird:He didn't want to give up that stew.Mary:No, I guess not.Bird:You make good stew. Even the dogs like it.Mary:Thanks for the compliment. Are you hungry yet?[Mary takes the pot]Bird:Yeah, I could eat the whole pot.[Mary lifts the lid]Mary:What happened to the stew?Bird:I don't know. What happened to it?Mary:There's only half a pot here.Bird:Oh. Well, the dog was eating it.Mary:The dog was eating it?Bird:That's how I caught up to him.Mary:How?Bird:He stopped to eat.Mary:Well, we can't eat this now.Bird:No?Mary:I'll have to make a new pot.Bird:There's still half a pot there.Mary:That's okay.Bird:I can take that stew, if you want.Mary:Don't worry.I'll make some extra for you.Patty:Have some coffee, Bird.Bird:ThanksHey, what are you doing here? And what happened in here?Was there a fight?Patty:Not really.Bird:What a mess. It looks like hell.Patty:Yeah, it does, doesn't it?Bird:Hey, I heard your plane take off. 55 Patty:Yeah, I missed it.But at least I got my interview.Bird:You know what? I got something more for your tape.Patty:Oh yeah?Bird:Yeah, when I heard that dog howling all of a sudden, it remindedme of something.Patty:Of what?Bird:You want to hear it?Patty:Sure, let's hear it.[Bird waits]Okay, you can start any time.Bird:Aren't you gonna record it?Patty:Oh, sorry about that.[Patty starts the tape]Bird:So we saw a movie one time where the soldiers were pouring hot tarover the castle walls. They were shouting:\"Hot tar! Hot tar!\"So anyway a few days later, these two boys were running away froma priest, and they ran right up a tree. That priest was yelling:\"If you little brats don't come down right now, I'll have to come upthere and get you!\"But those little kids wouldn't come down, so that priest startedclimbing up there. All of a sudden, those kids started yelling,\"Hot water! Hot water!\"And then that priest jumped down and started howling[Bird throws his head back and howls]Just like that dog of Henry Joseph's.Patty:How come?Bird:How come?[Bird demonstrates from the chair]Bird:Cause they were pissing all over him.Patty:It must have got that priest pretty mad.Bird:Yeah, he started speaking French.Mary:Ah, Bird, how'd you ever survive that school? 6856 [Pause]Bird:You want to know how?I used to go down to the cliffs. Over by the swimming hole there nearthe school. And I'd sit there, looking out over the lake. I just keptthinking to myself: one day I won't be here no more. I'll be out atMisty Lake. Out on the island, setting up the fish camp. It'd be a hotsummer day, and there wouldn't be a cloud in the sky. Andeverything would be just fine again.Mary:That's where I went, too, you know. Five years ago.I'd ask myself: \"If this is happening to me, what can I do to make itbetter? What can I do to change it?\"When I looked at it that way, I went out to Misty Lake and I cried andI laid in the snow and I looked up at those stars so far away, and Ithought to myself:\"I put myself into this mess. If there's a way in, there has to be a wayout\"That's the night I started my journey, my healing path, from out onthe frozen ice at Misty Lake.[Short pause]I'll take you out there sometime, Patty. During fish camp. How aboutthis summer?Patty:This summer?Mary:Why not? I can show you how we fish, and maybe you can tell me afew stories this time. Maybe you've got a few to tell, eh?[Patty speaks to the audience]Patty:She was right.I needed to go out there to Misty Lake. To take stock.To remember. To heal those wounds of mine. The ones I didn'teven know I had.[The drummer enters]And now I'm here again, looking back over my life, seeing it moreclearly nowwithout trying to deny what I've been through, what'sbrought me here to this point. I've had to look hard at myself, to lookbeyond myself, to go after something higher in life, and to think about 57 others for the first time ever. For once in my life, I'm trying to do allthat.Here I am, getting ready to go out to Misty Lake again. And maybe,in time, my hope is that we'll all have a chance to meet someone likeMary and visit a place like Misty Lake.[Drumming comes up. Lights fade. Blackout]End Challenges of Respecting Indigenous WorldViews in Eurocentric Education James [Sa'ke'j] Youngblood Henderson Canadian educators daily ask that Aboriginal peoples acquiesce to or fit within theCanadian version of Eurocentrism. It is a common struggle to all colonized Indigenouspeoples around the earth. They ask that we either achieve within the Eurocentric model ofeducation or live a life of poverty and welfare. If we do not fully immerse ourselves inEurocentric education, we are called \"uneducated.\" In one way or another, we are beingforced to validate the colonialists' mythology. We are being forced to affirm alien valuesand to sacrifice Aboriginal world views and values for norms outside traditional culturalaims.Canadian education systems continue to assert that assimilation withinEurocentric thought is the best path for Aboriginal people. The penalties are high forrefusing to conform to Eurocentric thought. It is perceived that Canadian society willexclude us from the benefits of Canadian society, if we refuse to affirm to their version ofsociety. In effect, the system forces us to give up our inherent and constitutional rights toAboriginal ecological order and world view, and our ability to teach future generations. Itforces us to recognize and affirm a Eurocentric and individualistic educational system thatperpetuates colonialism's iron law. Jean-Paul Sartre noted the existence of an \"iron lawwhich denied the oppressed all weapons which he did not personally steal from theoppressor\" (Sartre, in Noel, 1994, p. 147). Their iron law forces us to be someone we arenot. Yet, when we ask them to respect our world views, this simple request is most oftenregarded as engaging in conflict.Such assimilation schemes are unacceptable to most Aboriginal peoples. They arebased upon false premises that prevent any discussion of Aboriginal world views inEurocentric education systems. Aboriginal educators must create new premises as well asdiscover traditional approaches upon which to build for the next seventh generation.In the early stages of fighting for basic survival, we were forced to accept 597,1 Eurocentric world views and their analysis. Speaking as the first generation of Eurocentriceducated Chickasaw and Tsistsistis (Cheyenne) male, I intimately remember that force, andlive with the effects. Most Aboriginal students remember these experiences, even if theydo not want to.We were unaware that the Eurocentric knowledge systems do not have anexistence independent of their hierarchical relations in an artificial order. We were notaware that Eurocentric thought rejects the idea of intelligible spirits or essences in anecological order, which are the foundation of Aboriginal knowledge. The intelligible spiritsare called respectively among the Algonquian languages as matu, manidoo, manito,mantu, or manitou. We were not aware that human purposes are the foundation ofEurocentric knowledge. Only gradually did we understand that we could not succeed inEurocentric knowledge if we questioned their superiority or privileges. To succeed, we hadto learn, by memory, their artificial order. To learn their order, we had to master theirhistory and thought. And we had to polish the genius of the dead European male scholarin our essays and thoughts. Only gradually did we learn that one cannot win at a gamewith rigged rules that are likely to change when the colonized discover how they work.Forced to look inward for a secure cognitive foundation, the educated colonized learn toknow their Aboriginal heritage and identity.Some of us went to Eurocentric law school to learn how to change the rules, onlyto be told they could not change them at all. Yet, we found ways to change themembedded in their own teachings.Memmi (1965) recounts the colonial education process, as familiar to Aboriginalpeoples:And [the colonized] who has the wonderful good luck to be accepted in a schoolwill not be saved nationally. The memory which is assigned him is certainly notthat of his people. The history which is taught him is not his own. ...He and hisland are nonentities... orreferenced to what he is not. ...The colonized is savedfrom illiteracy only to fall into linguistic dualism. ...In the colonial context,bilingualism is necessary....But while the colonial bilingualist is saved from beingwalled in, he suffers a cultural catastrophe which is never completely overcome....Suppose that he has learned to manage his language to the point of re-creatingit in written works; for whom shall he write, for what public? If he persists inwriting in his language, he forces himself to speak before an audience of deafmen. ... It is a curious fact to write for a people other than one's own, and it iseven stranger to write to the conquerors of one's people. ...As soon as they darespeak, what will they tell just those people, other than of their malaise and revolt?Next, we realized that to acquire dignity and reassert our humanity as Aboriginal thinkers, \"educated\" Indians had to critique Eurocentrism. We also realized the need toassert our Aboriginal world views and our ecological orders. We had to live with theambiguity of thinking against our educated consciousness. This sacrifice was necessary forthe future generations. If educated Aboriginal people did not protect their world views,language, and heritage, cultural extinction would occur in a few decades. If we did notacknowledge and restore our world views, languages, and heritage, our education wouldaccomplish the goal that military force, missionaries, and poverty could not accomplish.More than restore respect of Aboriginal world views and languages, we had to develop newsyntheses of knowledge to lead the existing education system into a post-colonial era.Eurocentric thinkers rarely understand the elegance of Aboriginal thought and donot question the negative myths of colonial thought. They easily conclude that Aboriginalknowledge, consciousness, and languages are irrelevant to contemporary Canadianthought. They see them as life worlds without systems. Yet, when one aspires todecolonize or empower Aboriginal peoples, these neglected concerns contain the authorityto heal Aboriginal identity and communities. Restoring Aboriginal world views andlanguage is essential to realizing Aboriginal solidarity and power.Paulo Freire, A Brazilian social reformer and educator, has argued that only withinthe existing participatory relationship with natural, cultural, and historical realities canpeople be educated. He also argues that a critical consciousness of the cultural andhistorical roots of a people, as understood and expressed by them, is the foundation oftheir cultural emancipation. Moreover, he asserts that reformers must begin with the waya group talks about their world. Thus, fundamental to any Aboriginal emancipation,existing Aboriginal world views, languages, knowledge, customary orders, and laws have tobe validated by Canadian institutions and thought. Aboriginal people cannot know whothey are through the structure of alien language. If they do not know who they are, andwhat their gifts and visions are, they remain trapped in Eurocentric context and discourseforever.Let us look at the issue of respecting Indigenous world views in Eurocentriceducation from the perspectives of contextuality. Contextuality animates modern thoughtand education. Then, we will look at the Eurocentric obstacles to respecting Aboriginalworld views within the Canadian education system.The Idea of ContextualityFaced with competing world views, the concepts of paradigms or context isimportant. In attempting to understand the natural order of the world, Kuhn (1962),' a 6173 historian of science, has explained the process of intellectual transformations in thesciences as \"paradigm shifts.\" Periodically, in science, natural phenomena (often called\"anomalies\"), that scientists cannot explain by reference to the basic assumptions ofestablished science, are discovered to have a unity that requires fundamentally newpostulates. The new explanatory unity and its postulates are the substance of a newscientific paradigm. The paradigm shifts in the history of science, from the Copernican tothe Newtonian, and from the Newtonian to the Einsteinian, demonstrate how radicallyexplanations of how the world works can change over time.In the humanities, social sciences, education and law, such explanatory paradigmsare called \"contexts.\" Eurocentric contexts can be either natural or artificial, but most areartificial. Thus, they are called contexts. The Brazilian social philosopher Roberto Unger(1984) 2 has asserted that, if a context allows people to move within it to discovereverything about the world they can discover, it is a natural context. If the context doesnot allow such movement, it is artificial. Shifts in contexts are called \"revolutions\" or\"transformations.\"Three theses define the modernist or Eurocentric contexts of ideas and actions.The first thesis is the principle of contextuality. Contextuality is the belief that assumptionsor desires that humans take as given will shape people's mental and social lives. Theseartificial givens can be either institutional or imaginative. Either way, these assumptionsform the limits of the artificial context. Thus, almost all modern thought and activity areconditional. These artificial assumptions form a picture of what the world is really like, andeven a set of premises about how thoughts and languages are or can be structured. Theyalso provide the framework for explaining and verifying world views.The second thesis is that all artificial contexts can be broken. The third thesis isthat the conditionality of an artificial context creates \"normalcy;\" thus, remains relativelyimmune to activities that bring, it into question or that open it up to revision and conflict(Unger, 1984). An artificial context can be supplemented or revised by other empoweringassumptions or ideas about features that make one explanatory or society-making practicebetter than another. Small-scale, routine adjustments in a social and education contexthave the capacity to turn into a more uncontained transformation. The immunity of acontext depends on an awareness of its assumptive conditionality.Canadian society was created as a human artifact. It was derived from adeliberate artificial context, as opposed to the expression of an underlying natural order. Ifyou forget this contextual truth, then you forget that humans can reinvent it (Unger, 1984,7462 p. 10). Unger asserts that no social theory or thinker has ever taken the idea of society asartifact to its ultimate conclusion. Most Eurocentric social theories have either ignored thisultimate fact or balanced it with an ambition to develop a lawlike explanation of history,such as Marxism. Most liberating Eurocentric political movements based on lawlikeexplanations have failed. The failure of these grand narratives has prepared the way forunderstanding society as artifact. Since Canadian society and educational systems areartificial, Canadians can break loose from established views of themselves as helplesspuppets of social realms others have imagined, built, and inhabited, and from law-likeforces like social Darwinism, systems of colonial thought that brought these realms intobeing.Breaking the colonial context is precisely what the constitutional reforms inCanada and the Declaration of Indigenous Rights by the Indigenous people in internationalhuman rights law have attempted to accomplish. They sought to change ordinaryconsciousness with an extraordinary context-breaking legal act.By understanding how contexts stick together, come apart, and get remade,Aboriginal educators can disrupt the \"implicit, often involuntary alliance between theapologetics of established order, and the explanation of past or present society\" (Unger,1984, p. 5). Also, from our educational experiences, they can teach other educators howto revise the artificial contexts to respect a natural context of Aboriginal education.All major revision of educational systems depends on our success at diminishingthe distance between practical routine and transforming dialogues. Aboriginalempowerment relies on our educators' ability to invent institutions and practices thatmanifest context-revising freedoms. From an understanding of artificial educational contextand their effects, Aboriginal educators can understand how to inspire Aboriginal teachingsand traditions into educational contexts to end the domination and oppression that are theresidue of colonialism. A constructive understanding of the failure of artificial educationalcontexts also gives people greater mastery in reconstructing a more equitable educationalsystem.From this framework, let us turn to the artificial educational context of Europeancolonization, that is Eurocentrism and its strategies.EurocentrismThe cognitive and educational legacy of colonization is labelled \"Eurocentrism.\"Eurocentrism is an intellectual and educational movement that postulates the superiority ofEuropeans over non-Europeans. Eurocentrism has been the dominant artificial educational 63 context for the last five centuries and is an integral part of all existing scholarship. Itincludes a predatory set of assumptions and beliefs about empirical reality or the world.Habitually educated and usually unprejudiced Europeans accept these assumptions andbeliefs as true, as propositions supported by \"the facts.\"Quebec historian, Lise Noel (1994), has dramatically captured the consequencesof this artificial context:Alienation is to ;.:ie oppressed what self-righteousness is to the oppressor. Eachreally believes that their unequal relationship is part of the natural order of thingsor desires by some higher power. The dominator does not feel that he isexercising unjust power, and the dominated do not feel the need to withdrawfrom his tutelage. The dominator will even believe, in all good faith, that he islooking out for the good of the dominated, while the latter will insist that theywant an authority more enlightened than their own to determine their fate (p.79). A strong critique of Eurocentrism is under way in all fields of social thought (Blaut,1993). This critique reveals that the assumptions and beliefs that constructed the contextare not universal after all. They are not rational. Many are imaginative local knowledge;some are false (Blaut, 1993). These critiques give rise to anguished discourses aboutknowledge and truths. Quickly, the issue of respecting diversity slips into maintainingEurocentric unity and canons.The economic geographer, Jim Blaut (1993), argues that Eurocentrism is, quitesimply, the colonizers' model of the world. Eurocentrism is the colonizers' model of theworld in a very literal sense; it is not merely a bundle of beliefs. It has evolved, throughtime, into a finely sculpted model, a structured whole; in fact, an ultra-theory, a generalframework for many smaller theories: historical, geographical, psychological, sociological,and philosophical. This ultra-theory is known as diffusionism (Blaut, 1993).DiffusionismDiffusionism is the core of Eurocentrism. Its argument has changed throughtime, but its basic nineteenth-century epistemological framework has remained essentiallyunchanged. Blaut (1993) argues that diffusionism is based on two axioms: (1) mosthuman communities are uninventive; and (2) a few human communities (or places, orcultures) are inventive and, thus, remain permanent centers of cultural change or progress.On a global scale, this gives us a model of a world with a single civilized center roughly,Europeand a surrounding Indigenous periphery (p. 12).The dualism of an inside and an outside is central to the ultra-theory (Blaut, 1993, p. 14). The basic framework of diffusionism in its classical form depicts a world divided intotwo categories, one of which (Greater Europe, Inside) is historical, invents, and progresses;the other of which (non-Europe, Outside) is ahistorical, stagnant, and unchanging andreceives progressive innovations by diffusion from Europe. From this base, diffusionismasserts that the difference between the two sectors is that some intellectual or spiritualfactor, something characteristic of the \"European mind,\" the \"European spirit,\" \"WesternMan,\" and so forth, leads to creativity, imagination, invention, innovation, rationality, and asense of honor or ethicsin other words, \"European values.\" The reasons for non-Europe's non-progress is a lack of this intellectual or spiritual factor. This propositionasserts that non-European people are empty, or partly so, of \"rationality;\" that is, of ideasand proper spiritual values.Classic diffusionism asserts an emptiness of basic cultural institutions and peoplefor much of the non-European world. This is known as the diffusionist myth of emptiness.This idea plays a role in the physical movement of Europeans into non-European regions,displacing or eliminating the native inhabitants. The proposition of emptiness makes aseries of claims, each layered upon the others:1.A non-European region is empty or nearly empty of people (sosettlement by Europeans does not displace any Native peoples). 2.The region is empty of settled population: the inhabitants are mobile,nomadic, wanderers (therefore, European settlement violates no politicalsovereignty, since wanderers make no claim to territory). 3.The cultures of this region do not possess an understanding of privateproperty so the region is empty of property rights and claims (hence colonialoccupiers can freely give land to settlers since no one owns it). 4.The final layer, applied to all of the Outside, is an emptiness ofintellectual creativity and spiritual values, sometimes described by Europeans asan absence of \"rationality\" (Blaut, 1993, Chapter 2). 3 Classic diffusionism also assumes that some non-European regions were \"rational\"in some ways and to some degree. Thus, for instance, the Middle East, during biblicaltimes, was rational. China was somewhat rational for a certain period in its history. Otherregions, always including Africa, are unqualifiedly lacking in rationality.Diffusionism asserts that the normal and natural way the non-European worldprogresses or evolvesor changes for the better, modernizes, and so on is by thediffusion (or spread) of innovative, progressive ideas from Europe, which flow into it as air flows into a vacuum. This flow may take the form of ideas or new products, through whichthe European values are spread. The Europeans themselves are bearers of these new andinnovative ideas.The diffusion of civilizing ideas from Europe to non-Europe is compensation forthe confiscation of material wealth by Europe from non-Europe - although nothing can fullycompensate Europeans for their gift of civilization to the colonies since the possibility existsthat ancient, atavistic traits will counter-diffuse back into the civilized core, in the form ofmagical, evil things such as black magic.The debates between diffusionists and their opponents have been going on formore than a century in anthropology, geography, history, and all fields concerned withlong-term, large-scale cultural evolution. 4 The anti-diffusionists (often called\"evolutionists\" or \"independent-inventionists\") level two basic charges against thediffusionists: they hold much too sour a view of human ingenuity and they believe in spatialelitism. Yet, anti-diffusionists have failed to grasp the full implication of their critique.None of them denies that the world has an Inside and an Outside. While criticizing thediffusionists for rejecting the psychic unity of humankind, the anti-diffusionists,nonetheless, believe that Europe is the center of cultural evolution. Therefore, they acceptthe ideaexplicitly or implicitlythat Europeans are more inventive and more innovativethan everyone else. They make this assumption explicitly when they discuss themodernizing effect of European colonialism. The basic structure of their arguments is thesame as that of the diffusionists.All Eurocentric scholarship is diffusionist since it axiomatically accepts that theworld has one permanent center from which culture-changing ideas tend to originate, anda vast periphery that changes as a result (mainly) of diffusion from that single center. Thisultra-theory asserts that colonialism brings civilization to non-Europe and is, in fact, theproper way that the non-European world advances out of stagnation. Under colonialism,wealth is drawn out of the colonies and enriches the European colonizers. In Eurocentricdiffusionism, Europeans see this as a normal relationship between European andIndigenous peoples. Although Eurocentric diffusionism is constructed on some unjustifiablyrestrictive assumptions, it nevertheless provides the context for colonial legal and politicalstrategy.UniversalismEurocentric thought does not claim to be a privileged norm. This would be an 7866 argument about cultural relativism, which asserts that values are about specific culturalcontexts.5 Instead, Eurocentric thought claims to be universal and general.6 Noel (1994)summarizes the function of universalism in colonialism:To present himself as the ideal human type, the dominator often invokedirreducible laws sanctioned by nature, God, or History. In his view, the power heexercised over the oppressed was not so much the result of undue reliance onforce as the effect of uncontrollable imperatives, if not a Higher Will. In relationto the universal model that the oppressor seemed to represent, the dominatedalways appeared to be afflicted with some defect or intrinsic failing (p. 147).European scholars have always held that their civilization had two sources ofinspiration that forbade them to rest content with developing their own society and part ofthe world. The first inspiration was the search for knowledge. This quest was anoutgrowth of the \"wonder\" that Aristotle found at the beginning of all thought and of thetalk in which Socrates sought to engage each person capable and willing to listen. Everydiscovery was examined for its universality, and life was to be tested by questioning itsuniversal good. This quest for truth, universal values, and virtue informs the idea of theuniversal civilization, and begins to explain why Europeans left their lands and went to suchefforts to discover, as they thought, the whole world and to see it as a \"whole\" world.The other reason Europeans could not rest content with perfecting their own partof the world is the messianic prophecy of monotheistic religions. Europeans had a belief in,and a commitment to, a messianic dream of a millennium: a new heaven, a new earth, anda transformed people. The Judaic vision of linear time moved toward a predetermined end.Christianity supplemented this vision with divine commands to the disciples that they hadsomething to do and they were to be about it.'What Socrates and the prophets of the Bible shared is the notion of a universalmission that invites the attention of all humans. It is ironic that national laws of the timeattempted to end the idea of this new knowledge and the transformation to a universalcivilization. The executions of Socrates and of Christ were both legally sanctioned and,indeed, have served to make subsequent generations suspicious of legal institutions andaware of the inherent contradictions in preserving legal order and doing justice. With thesedeaths came questions as to the limits and nature of politics and law, which led to the ideaof a civil public. Central to the ideal of a civil public is a search for knowledge, truth, and ajust legal order.Universality is really just another aspect of diffusionism, and claiming universalityoften means aspiring to domination (Noel, 1994, p. 12). Eurocentric universality creates 677 3 cultural and cognitive imperialism, which establishes a dominant group's knowledge,experience, culture, and language as the universal norm. Dominators or colonizersreinforce their culture and values by bringing the oppressed and the colonized under theirexpectations and norms. Given the assumed normality of the dominators' values andidentity, the dominators construct the differences of the dominated as inferior and negative(Young, 1990). Thus arises the consciousness of the immigrant-colonizer and theAboriginal-colonized, which the colonized have to accept if they are to survive. This binaryconsciousness justifies the separation of Indigenous peoples from their ancient rights to theland and its resources, and the transfer of wealth and productivity to the colonialists andthe mother-country (Memmi, 1965).8The Canadian colonialist educator represents the embodiment of the universal,the dominator has the privilege of not being considered as a member of any specific group(Memmi, 1965). Canadian educators are in a position to study others who pose a\"problem,\" present a \"question,\" or constitute a \"case\" (Memmi, 1965, p. 11). In searchingfor the answers for others, dominators believe they not only maintain a universal discourse,but speak the language of objectivity or impartiality.Typically, to succeed in creating this sense of objectivity, colonizers must obscureAboriginal memory. To strip Indigenous peoples of their heritage and identity, the colonialeducation and legal system induce collective amnesia that alienates Indigenous peoplesfrom their elders, their linguistic consciousness, and their order of the world. Only theEurocentric oppressor is the agent of progress, either by the will of God or by the law ofnature. The sum of European learning is established as the universal model of civilizationto be imitated by all groups and individuals. The oppressors' imperatives monopolizehistory or progress. In the Eurocentric construct of three-dimensional time, whoevermasters the present molds the past (Memmi, 1965).Strategy of DifferencesIn contrast to universalism was the strategy of differences applied to Aboriginalpeoples around the world. Universal humanity may have been a key idea, but colonialeducators did not apply it universally. Because colonizers consider themselves to be theideal model for humanity and carriers of superior culture and intelligence, they believe theycan judge other people and assess their competencies. In short, colonizers believe theyhave the power to interpret differences, and this belief shaped the institutional andimaginative assumptions of colonization and modernism. Using the strategy of differences,colonialists believe they have the privilege of defining human competencies and deviances8068 such as sin, offense, and mental illness. They also believe they have the authority toimpose their tutelage on the colonized and to remove from them the right to speak forthemselves.French philosopher Michael Foucault (1970) locates, at the outset of thecolonizing period, a shift in the fundamental mode whereby knowledge is acquired:The activity of the mind...will... nolonger consist in drawing things together, insetting out on a quest for everything that might reveal some sort of kinship,attraction or secretly shared nature within them, but, on the contrary, indiscriminating, that is, in establishing their identities. ...In this sense,discrimination imposes upon comparison the primary and fundamentalinvestigation of difference. (p. 55)The strategy of difference is not simply abstract or analytical. It directly affectssecular Eurocentric identity and order. Despite its pretension, colonial thought was lessinterested in the constitution of universal human nature than in a quest for understandingthe different forms of human awareness of other people, of nature, and of themselvesassumed in each kind of historical social life (Unger, 1978, p. 5). Through this strategy ofdifference, Eurocentric thinking created an artificial context of racism and spread it aroundthe world.The strategy of racism allows the colonialists to assert Eurocentric privileges whileexploiting Indigenous peoples in an inhuman way (Michelson, 1968, p. 215).9 As Memmi(1965) explains:Racism is the generalized and final assigning of values to real or imaginarydifferences, to the accuser's benefit and at his victim's expense, in order to justifythe former's own privileges or aggression. (p. 185)The strategy of stressing differences between European \"civilization\" and New Worldsavages is the dominant theme of Canadian history texts.Within Eurocentric knowledge, the colonizers asserted expansive claim toexclusive rationality and its arrogant assumption of a universal and uniform knowledge ofthe world which they could not live up to. Indigenous people were excluded from this\"universal\" definition, and, thus, became \"other.\" These definitions are always simple,irrational, and reductive (Noel, 1994, p. 109).The difference between self and other was an extension of the noun-basedlinguistic structure of Eurocentric thought. It followed the English language object-subjectstructure. With the rejection of the noun-God's commandments and the unitary,suprahistorical intelligible human essence of classical thought, Eurocentric thought and 69 languages could only perceive subjective categories and make inferences (Unger, 1975).The two methods used to do this were logical analysis and causal explanation. Eachprovided an interpretation of what it means to account for something subjective; both inthe sense of telling what it is like, which is description, and in the sense of establishing whyit had to follow from something else, which is explanation in the strict sense.European scholars had constructed the phenomenon of Eurocentrism on thenoun-centered structure of Indo-European languages. They also fabricate it fromEurocentric historical dialectical narratives. These narratives center on the inherentsuperiority of the Indo-European people over all others, and on the dialectic of their selfand others, who existed beyond their scope of knowledge. The fundamental problemconcerns the way in which knowledge (and, therefore, theory or history) is constitutedthrough the comprehension and incorporation of the other. Examples of how the otherwas constituted are in the contexts of master/servant, sovereign/subject, civilized/savage,and and other dualism. Outside these contexts, they have notattempted to create a place for other as the other. They have tried to create some justrelations with the self and the other.European thinkers derive the dialectical structure from the structure of the Indo-European languages. This structure is revealed by the subject-verb-object way of lookingat the world. It is represented in the idea of the sentence. The operation of this linguisticstructure informed their world view. However, it was not until recently that Derrida arguesthe operation of language itself creates the necessity of both the self and the other, ratherthan any external reality.I will return to this insight later. We will continue the sequentialquest to understand the relations between the self and other in European philosophy.Rational DualitiesThe massive hemorrhage that colonialism inflicted on Indigenous peoples is welldocumented. By 1914, Britain boasted of an empire 140 times its size; Belgium, 80 times;Holland, 60 times; France and Germany, 20 times. These nations were on the verge ofcolonizing the entire Indigenous peoples of the earth. The colonists created newhierarchies and governments that believed in the absolute superiority of Europeans overthe colonized, the masculine over the feminine, the adult over the child, the historical overthe ahistorical, and the modern or \"progressive\" over the traditional or \"savage.\" Theseartificial political orders reflected ways of thinking that were defined by dialectics orpolarities: the modern and the primitive, the secular and the non-secular, the scientific andthe unscientific, the expert and the layman, the normal and the abnormal, the developed 8 270 and the underdeveloped, the vanguard and the led, the liberated and the saveable (Nandy,1983, p. x). In this brave new world, through a curious transposition, the colonialdominators called upon the colonized to justify themselves (Nandy, 1983, p. ix). Ahistorical, primitive people would one day, the colonists said, learn to see themselves asmasters of nature and, thus, masters of their own fate and a brave new world (Nandy,1983). The psychological consequences of this strategy are currently unfolding.A modern benchmark in Eurocentric thought was the extension of colonialismstrategies to Europe in two world wars. These wars illustrated the problems of colonial ormodern thought, which created the Enlightenment around the idea of reason. Resolvingthe effect of reason was the beginning of unravelling predatory thought in Eurocentrism (orits masked \"Western\" thought ethnocentric annihilatingdialectical structure.Philosopher Emmanuel Levinas noted that Eurocentric philosophy has been struckwith the horror of the other that remains the other (Taylor, 1986, p. 346). The other wasan insurmountable allergy to the Eurocentric quest for totality, the desire for unity and theuniversal monotheism. Through their vision of totality, Eurocentrism sacrifices the presentto the future. Its premise is that the future will bring forth an ultimate, objective meaningof oneness or at least until they realize equality. Levinas thought that the logical outcomeof this underlying allergy of philosophy was Hegel's philosophy (Taylor, 1986, p. 347).Hegel (1910) lays out the linguistic operation of the dialectical structure. Hearticulates a philosophical structure that pivots the dialectic of the same versus the other orthe master versus slaves, or the colonizer versus colonized. Similarly, Marxism deals withthe oppositional dialectic of capital versus class. Foucault calls these oppositional groupings\"the sovereign model of power,\" which is to say that power has a single source in same,master, colonizer or capital.The duality operates by a knowledge system requiring a subject perceiving anobject through the process of negation, or seeing difference. In these situations, theyalways center the dialectic on the self as an observer, even though it is outward looking.The self is always searching for power and control over the world. As Rousseau saw,anthropology is the clearest symptom of this way of viewing the world. Little space existsfor a dialogue or conversation between the self and other.The Eurocentric dialectic asserts the appropriation of the other as a sub-division ofits knowledge. Little space is available for the other as independent of the totalization ofknowledge, unless the other is \"unknowable.\" If \"unknowable,\" it is not knowledge. If 718 3 knowable, the alternatives available are the choice of being equal as constituted by thesubject categories or of being the mystical other outside the subject categories, e.g. blackmagic, etc. Such a construction of knowledge operates by incorporation or expropriation ofthe other. Dialectic thought has little tolerance with otherness; ignores or leaves itoutside its narratives, stimulates Eurocentric diffusionism, colonialism, racism, and otherstrategies of difference.Since World War I, the narrative of twentieth-century thought is a continuousattempt to get out of the dualism or binary categories. In Eurocentric thought, noalternative to the dialectic has been found. The dialectic appears to be intrinsic to the nounstructure of the European languages. Also, Eurocentric thought has an immunity system.One cannot get out of it by negation or contradiction, because the dialectic already includesnegation and opposition as the working of resistance. One cannot get away from thedialectic by ignoring it, excluding or extirpating its processes as Eurocentric thought hasrevealed.After the horror of World War II, both German and French scholars re-examinedthe Enlightenment traditions for similar reasons. Fascism seemed to have stopped in itstracks the long march of the progress of reason. It ended the liberating enlightenmentideas (of which many Eurocentric scholars thought Marxism was the fullest politicaldevelopment). In Germany, Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of the Enlightenment(1944) created the Frankfurt School of critical thinkers. They attempted to explain howreason had developed into fascism, human genocide, and violation of human rights. Theiranswer was that Enlightenment's dialectic of reason has always contained a measure ofirrationality; the negative part of reason had led to tyranny and domination. The verypowers of rationality that enabled the Europeans to free themselves from nature andcontrol has also become an instrumental device to dominate them. Europeans hadrationalized Nature into productive commodities. They had rationalized their own humanityinto an empty and passive consumer. The task for critical scholars was to excise theirrationality that had produced this domination. They had to redefine reasons and theforms of identity thinking that had defined existence as an indistinguishable element of thecollective. In this way, through emphasizing the autonomy and spontaneity of theindividual, they might retrieve the original goal of enlightenment. This created theFrankfort School that Habermas led.For French thinkers, they had to deal with the colonial and imperial legacy.Colonialism and Eurocentric diffusionism were not rational premises of society. Ce'saire,8472 Fanon and Foucault saw fascism as simply European colonialism brought home to Europe.After the first world war, as a country deprived of an overseas empire, Germany sought tocolonize the colonizer and acquire world empire. The French thinkers did not try to purgethe irrationality out of rational thought, instead they analyzed reason itself. They sawirrationality as simply reason's negative other, an excluded but necessary dialectic.Despotic enlightenment was based on reason. The relationship of the enlightenment, itsgrand projects, and universal truth-claims were all related to European colonialism. Thisinvolved both an understanding of the relentless critique of the collusive forms of Europeanknowledge that created colonization, and a direct analysis of its effects. For Foucault, thiscomprised a vigorous critique of historicism and its relation to the operations of knowledgeand power (or historicist forms of knowledge).The French thinkers focused on ways to undo reason's own tendency todomination, dogmatism and despotism. Specifically, they challenged rationality's claims touniversality. Reason had to be liberated from itself, they could not recognize it as universalor totalizing.It is from this perspective that it becomes possible to understand the basis ofthe distrust of totalizing systems of knowledge that depends upon theory and ideas.Foucault and Lyotard (1970) sought to isolate the singularity or contingent event in reasonas opposed to universality. The search for the singularity that refused all conceptualizationconstructed a new form of knowledge that respects the other without trying to absorb orassimilate it into the same. This created the post-structuralists and post-modernists.In the post war era, European scholars began deconstructing the sovereign,civilized reasoning of Eurocentric thought. The deconstruction of Eurocentric (Occidental orWestern) knowledge, or self, illustrates the extent to which Europe's other has been anarcissistic self-image through which it has artificially constructed itself. Deconstructionisminvolves the decentralization and decolonization of European thought or episteme.Levinas (1961), in Totalityand Infinity,is illustrative of these thinkers. He wrotehis book under the terror of two world wars in Europe, but dialectical thought continues tobe his methodology. He defined politics as the art of foreseeing war and of winning it.War is another form of the appropriation of the others, and underpins all ontologicalthinking with its violence. The violence involved in politics is more than just physical force,injuring or annihilating persons. It is also \"ontological imperialism,\" a process that results ininterrupting their continuity, making them play roles in which they no longerrecognize themselves, making them betray not only commitments but their own .substance ...(Taylor, 1986, p. 21). 73 Such destructive activities, to Levinas (1961), should not be immune for ethical or moralconsideration, since war is the philosophical concept of being (ontology) itself. He arguedthat politics should not be placed before morality. Since being is always defined asappropriation of others as identities. Once defined as identities, they are appropriated intolarger orders or categories (knowledge, history, or state).His objection to Eurocentric totalization and of ontology is its inherent violent andnegative reaction towards the other. Eurocentric knowledge always views the other as athreat. The only issue is the degree of the threat Eurocentric knowledge projects onto theother. Its only response to the other is to appropriate and sublate the essence of the otherinto itself. Eurocentric theory and the understanding of the spectator are unable to let theother remain outside itself, a singularity or separation outside its vision of totality. Suchontological imperialism forces the alterity of the other to vanish into sameness. It forcesthe other to be neutralized as a means of integration. This response will be true of anyidea that is different. Eurocentric knowledge must appropriate the other in an act ofviolence and reduction. This desire to comprehension and representation cannot do justiceto the different.In this situation, Eurocentric ontology amounts to a universal egotism of Europeanthinkers in which the relations with the other are accomplished through its assimilation intothe self. Rather than being about existence, a philosophy of existence becomes aphilosophy of power and control. It is not a valid theory of knowledge.Perhaps the historian best illustrates the processes of totalization. Ahistoriographer assimilates all particular existences and events into the structure ofuniversal history, a chronological order or grand narrative. This narrative becomesanalogous to nature itself (Taylor, 1986, p. 55). Such history silently incorporates otherswithin its dominant order, often masking cruelty and injustice within its recording ofrighteous victory. It is another manifestation of the need to appropriate the other into thefamiliar. It ignores the alterity of the other, and the alterity of their interpretation of timeand events or their absolute past.Also, the Eurocentric quest of imperialism of sameness justifies the Eurocentricself in extending itself to anything that threatens its identity with the potential to assimilateit. This justification is the source of colonization and wars. It is a theory of freedom that isnot based on justice, which respects the alterity of the other, and leads to understandingthrough the asymmetry of dialogue.Levinas (1961) proposed that instead of violence toward the other, European 74 thought should learn to respect the other and accept an infinite separation of the otherfrom sameness. The idea of infinity is the antidote to totality. It marks a relationship witha surplus always exterior to the totality (Taylor, 1986, p.-22). Yet, how can Eurocentricknowledge know, respect, and understand the other?Derrida's Of Grammatology focuses on a critique of ethnocentrism, of\"logocentrisms,\" the dialectics of the centre and the margin, which is another version ofEurocentrism. The dialectic operates geographically and conceptually. It articulates thepower relations between Europe and the colonies. It deconstructs the idea, the authority,and the assumed superiority of Eurocentric thought. This is often referred to as post-modern thought.Post-modern thought can best be defined as European scholars' awareness thatEurope is no longer the unquestioned and dominant centre of the world. It involves a moreactive critique of the premises of Eurocentric knowledge, by using its own alterity in relationto other forms of knowledge. However, post-modern thought is another attempt byEuropean scholars to regain intellectual control.The crisis of our times has created post-colonial Indigenous thinkers and societieswho struggle to free themselves from the Eurocentric colonial context. Most of thesescholars are gifted immigrant scholars from the colonized countries that teach university inEngland or the United States; for example, Said, Bhabba, and Spivak. While they still haveto use the techniques of Eurocentric thought, they have had the courage to rise abovethem and create new intellectual traditions. They have built on the traditions of Gandhi,who has shown British society that its self-legitimating and self-congratulatory colonialrace-relations discourses were inconsistent with any concept of a rule of law. Additionally,they build on the works of Frantz Fanon and Albert Memmi, who have shown that the race-relations theories were grounded in and sustained by themes derived from European racismand imperialism.Aboriginal RestorationIn Canadian universities and colleges, Eurocentric contexts inform the academiccurricula. Most of the contexts reject the idea of intelligible spirits as essences of anecology. They reject that all life in nature has an intelligible spirit. They reject that life canbe animated by these spirits or life forces. They reject that the human mind canunderstand an ecology through these life forces or the language that conforms to thisvision. Instead, Eurocentric educators believe there are numberless ways in which they canclassify ideas, objects, and events in an ecology. The only standard to justify these Eurocentric classification or consequential categories is by determining the particularhuman desire or purpose that created the classification. The only validity of the Eurocentricclassification system is its power to advance the ends of people who fabricated the system.The validity rests on their ability to contribute to particular and instrumental ends, such asmeasurement, or prediction, or control of events. No basis exists for saying that oneclassification system or language portrays the \"real\" world more accurately than another.When most professors describe the \"world,\" they describe artificial Eurocentriccontexts and ignore Aboriginal world views, knowledge, and thought. For most Aboriginalstudents, the realization of their invisibility is similar to looking into a still lake and notseeing their image. They become alien in their own eyes, unable to recognize themselvesin the reflections and shadows of the world. As the dignity and wealth of theirgrandparents and parents was stripped, today's Aboriginal students are being stripped oftheir heritage and identity. Annihilation of hope, progress and cultural continuity is theresult, though conscious resistance to alienation can develop.Often when Aboriginal students become aware of the colonizers' vision of themand reject it, they experience what W.E.B. DuBois (1969) called \"double consciousness:\"This sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, ofmeasuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contemptand pity (p. 45). Double consciousness occurs when the colonized assert they are uniquely human, but thedominators reject this assertion and impose their standards as universal and normal (Noel,1994, p. 149).At best, Canadian universities and educational systems teach this doubleconsciousness to Aboriginal students. These educational systems define Aboriginalheritage, identity, and thought as inferior to the Aboriginals' adopted Eurocentric heritage,identity, and thought. However, such a conclusion is not validated by their own theory ofknowledge. They cannot evaluate Aboriginal world views by Eurocentric purposes ordesires, even if they believe them universal. No foundation exists for saying that Aboriginalworld views, heritage, or languages are inferior ways of knowing to any other world view.World views can only be evaluated on their ability to meet the Aboriginal beliefs.To attempt to evaluate Aboriginal world views by Eurocentric analysis is irrational.One cannot make rational choices among conflicting world views, especially those held bythe others. No world view describes an ecology or society more accurately than others. Allworld views describe some parts of the ecology or society completely, though in its own way. No world view has the power to completely describe the entire universe. Thepurposive theories that sustain Eurocentric thought do not allow for an independentcomparison of competing, or even potentially complementary, world views. UnlessEurocentric thought is willing to qualify the principle that classifications and categories areconstructed by human minds for human purposes, it cannot sustain any confidence in thepossibility of comparing Aboriginal world views and languages with Eurocentric world viewsand languages. Comparison of world view relies on the idea that there is a realm of thingsand events in nature, independent of the human mind, that is capable at some point ofbeing perceived as it truly is. However, this idea is itself grounded on the doctrine ofintelligible spirits or essences, which is rejected by Eurocentric thoughts for humanpurposes. Rejection of the sacred or immanence of spirit(s) can be construed as a \"blindspot\" of contextual incoherence or irrationality of Eurocentric thought.When Eurocentric thought is faced with a choice between two different paradigmsor theoretical views of the structure of nature for example, Newtonian and quantumtheoryonly the ability to measure, predict or control mediates the paradigms. Thissolution does not resolve the dilemma. Eurocentric scientists must still interpret the resultsof every experiment they perform and justify the methods of proof they have chosen.Since such purposes are arbitrary in conception, there are limited ways to prove betterresults.Typically, however, Eurocentric thought explicitly and implicitly confirms Aboriginalinadequacy and asserts a negative image of Aboriginal heritage and identity. Tragically,there is already a long history, in Canada, of students who have succumbed and inwardlyendorse Eurocentric thought and help lay the foundations of the relationship of dominationthat entrenches their thoughts (Noel, 1994). However, new Aboriginal scholars have beenasserting the validity of Aboriginal world view and knowledge and questioning Eurocentricbiases.Some of the best Aboriginal world view restoration in educational systems can befound in the writing of the Mi'kmaq educator, Marie Battiste (1986), especially in hercritique of cognitive imperialism. Other important Aboriginal thinkers and their writing areBlackfoot scholar, Leroy Littlebear; Maori educators Tewa educator, Gregory Cajete.Moreover, Aboriginal educators can find strength in the awareness of common 7789 cycles and patterns of Eurocentric thought itself. The needed transformation in context is acommon pattern in European legal thought. Indeed, it is a persistent cycle in all theircognitive reality. In the history of European consciousness, mastery in thought or worldviews is the mark of periods in which a novel set of ideas has been introduced by scholarsat a loss to solve particular problems in different fields of knowledge. Eventually, theydiscover these problems are connected with one another. Then, they find the sources oftheir bafflement in the premises that underlie the disciplines or contexts within whoseboundaries they have been working. At last, they establish new contexts that sweep awaythe difficulties they faced. Correspondingly, after mastery of a particular problem, there isa movement from ideological mastery to enslavement. As Hegel (1910) showed with greatbrilliance, the history of European thought and culture is an ever-changing pattern of greatliberating ideas that inevitably turn into suffocating straight-jackets.These paradoxes operate in Canadian versions of Eurocentric thought. Canada isa land of diversity, embracing vast differences within its borders and among its people.The Aboriginal and the Eurocentric educators need to create an integral knowledge in alleducational systems. Only such a knowledge system can meet the needs of all Canadians.They must accept transcultural dialogues and talking circles rather than validatingEurocentric knowledge. We must recognize cross-culturality as the potential terminationpoint of Eurocentric thought. Canadian legal thinkers must understand that cross-cultural,syncretic thought can create a legitimate place where each knowledge system isrecognized. Such thoughts and places can help the colonized Aboriginal people to recoveran effective identifying relation with a damaged ecology. This vision provides a frameworkof \"difference on equal terms\" within which transcultural knowledge may be cooperativelyand respectfully worked out in the future. End Notes 1A paradigm, for my purposes, is a set of implicit assumptions, concepts, theories, andpostulates held in common by several members of a community that enables them toexplore jointly a well-defined and delimited area of inquiry and to communicate in aspecialized language about the subject. These paradigms define the boundaries ofacceptable inquiry and the limiting assumptions within a discipline. 2Unger explained the contextual or conditional quality of all human activity: \"To saythat extended conceptual activity is conditional is to say that its practice depends on taking for granted, at least provisionally, many beliefs that define its nature and limits.These assumptions include criteria of validity, verification, or sense; a view ofexplanation, persuasion, or communication, and even an underlying ontology a pictureof what the world is really like. It may even include a set of premises about whetherand in what sense thought and language have a structure.\" 3See Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (New York:Scribner's, 1958) p. 30. 4Citing Marvin Harris, The Rise of Anthropological Theory.

Having chosen carefully, she takes a deep breath of eternity, exhales the lifeforce into each being and begins to weave. And so your life and all lives begin ...(Hall Iglehart, 1990)IntroductionIn 1996 to 1997, my daughter and I lived at Totonicapan in the Guatemalanhighlands. We worked with a group of Mayan educators who are developingeducational programs for working children. Totonicapan is one of the areas ofGuatemala where ancient Mayan teachings have been maintained by Mayan priests, ordaykeepers, to the present day. The daykeepers are initiated calendar diviners, dreaminterpreters, and readers of lightning in the blood, an ancient curing system. They arealso the link between the people, the ancestors and the creator and, today, these eldersare playing a central role in the creation of contemporary Mayan education programsthat are being developed in numerous communities throughout Guatemala.To the K'iche' Maya (The K'iche' are the largest group of the 22 Mayan peoplesin Guatemala numbering about 1.5 million people) heaven and earth are still the texts tolive by and prayers to the Creator address the heart of the sky, and the heart of theearth. To utter a word is to create the world for, to the K'iche', all words have a sacredresonance, a code of meaning that connects each person with the heart of the sky andthe heart of the earth. All acts of life are sacred acts, to be performed according to theround of the calendars and one's nagual, or position, in the sky wheel.Mayan traditional knowledge and teachings are an intricate part of everydaylife of the K'iche' Maya, and cannot be separated from the rest of community life as theyare firmly imbedded in it. The following traditions about time, and weaving, relatelargely to K'iche' Maya traditions from the area of Totonicapan. My intent in this paper is to illuminate some of the layers, or fractals, of these living teachings, and to provide asmall \"ilbal\" or seeing instrument into some of the issues facing contemporary Mayaneducators as they weave their living curriculum.Maltiox to all my Mayan teachers especially to Wensesloa Almira, and AgustinSapon Morales, educators, friends and daykeepers.Historical BackgroundThe contemporary Maya live in a region that stretches from Chiapas insouthern Mexico, encompassing all of Guatemala and parts of Belize, Honduras and ElSalvador. About 60 to 70 percent of Guatemala's 11 million people are Maya, speaking22 different languages. Since the country gained independence in 1821, the Mayapeople have suffered from poverty and discrimination at the hands of the dominantLadino minority, who own approximately 90% of the land and control the'country'spowerful military and the economy. Illiteracy and poverty continue to plague mostMaya communities. Life expectancy amongst the Guatemalan Maya today is 10 yearslower than among Ladinos, and infant mortality of Mayan children is the highest on thecontinent. Land reform is considered the key issue among thousands of landless Mayanpeople. In the current Guatemalan government, of eighty congress members only sixmembers are Mayan.Peace AccordsOn December 29, 1996, a peace accord was signed by the Guatemalangovernment and the URNG, the National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity, ending a 36year war that has been described by historians as one of the worst cases of genocide ofmodern times. During the country's civil war, Mayas bore the brunt of the bloodshed.Mayan communities became military-targets during the \"scorched-earth\" counter-insurgency campaign in the early 1980s, as the army considered the Maya to beguerrilla allies, and thus targeted their highland communities for repression.Testimonial stories and eye-witness accounts document human rights abusesagainst men, women and children unparalleled in this century. Between 1978 and1985, four hundred and forty-four Mayan villages were destroyed in military operationsin the Guatemalan highlands. Between 60,000 and 200,000 people were killed, andover 40,000 \"disappeared.\" Another 500,000 became internal refugees, 150,000 fled toMexico, and more than 200,000 Mayans sought refugee status in other countries.The Peace Accords established a Truth Commission, but their mandate didn'tinclude identifying violators or persecuting war criminals. Consequently, a grass-roots 9482 campaign led by the Catholic Church, called the Recovery of the Historical MemoryProject(REMHI), was created in April 1995. The goal of this project was to collect thetestimonies of the civilian population who suffered most from the armed conflict. Themajority of the victims of the war were poor Mayan farmers who lived in the highlands.The REMHI project collected 5,465 testimonies that were compiled into a four-volumedocument called Guatemala, Nunca Mas (Never Again), which documented 644massacres, many exterminating entire Mayan communities. During this time, manyMayas also concealed their languages and stopped wearing their traje (traditional dress)for fear of being identified as guerrilla supporters. Monsignor Juan Gerardi, the directorof the REMHI project, presented the report to the people on April 22, 1998. Four dayslater, he was brutally assassinated.Currently, there are over 400 Mayan non-governmental agencies that areworking to ensure that Mayan voices are part of the peace process in Guatemala. Theyhave formed an umbrella group called COPMAGUA the Coordinator of the MayanPeoplesto negotiate the content of the implementation of the Indigenous Accordsigned with the government as part of the peace accords. The Indigenous Accord isconsidered, by many, to be the most difficult part of the peace treaty to enforce.The Indigenous Accord specifies the establishment of three Commissions fornegotiations with the government. These concern educational reform, Indigenousparticipation, and land-related rights. In addition, there are two commissions to addressspirituality and sacred sites, and the officialization of Indigenous languages.COPMAGUA has advocated the need for three additional Commissions - onconstitutional reform, Indigenous women's rights, and one on traditional Indigenouslaw. COPMAGUA representatives such as Wencesloa Almira, the Executive Director ofUPMAG, the Union of Mayan Peoples, have stated that the Indigenous Accord is nottheir goal, but just a beginning of ensuring Indigenous participation in Guatemala'sfuture.However, on May 18th, 1998, The Globe and Mail reported that, \"the ballotthat would have given Indian groups official recognition was defeated. Indian leaderscited poverty, weak political organization, and division left by the war as reasons for thedefeat.\" Only 18% of registered voters cast ballots, and the Globe and Mail went on todocument that \"the vote heightened tensions between the country's Indigenous majorityand those who feared reforms would give Indians special privileges.\" 835' Maintaining Sacred Balance - Mayan Concepts of TimeDespite Guatemala's continued denial of the rights of the majority of itspopulation, Mayan educators continue their project of creating Mayan schools followingMayan curricula. Two important elements at the core of the new programs are theteachings about time and about weaving.The K'iche' people maintain the Mayan calendrical system, which was one ofthe most advanced in the world at the time of the Spanish conquest of Latin America.The Maya recorded the lunar and solar systems, calculated eclipses, as well as the orbitsof Venus, Mars and Jupiter. The daykeepers are considered shaman-priests, and areconsidered the traditional peoples' link to the Creator. They are responsible formaintaining the balance between the divine and daily life, through an intricate system ofinterpreting time. The sacred 260-day calendar provides the base of the elaboratedivination system that daykeepers use to interpret each day's sacred meaning and itscorrespondence to daily life. Not only do the days have proper names and charactersthat are divine, but so do the numbers. The combination of days and numbers issignificant as well as the context. A \"good\" day in one context may be a \"bad\" day inanother. Children are taught not only the meaning of each day, but about their ownsacred days of conception, birth, and protection as a foundation for endogenouseducation, where they must find their face, find their heart, and find their foundation.K'iche' time also has functions that are connected to it related to curing,economics, health, family, and community life. The ancestors, the gods and the livingpeople are all linked up through their time system, creating an environment that infusestheir whole existence. Edward Hall (1983) described it as follows:The Quiche reality causes them to scrutinize each day and its character as itrelates to their own character, their desires, and their past, as well as the tasksthat lie ahead. The Quiche really do have to think deeply and seriously aboutthe process of how each day is to be lived. For the Quiche, living a life issomewhat analogous to composing music, painting, or writing a poem. Eachday, properly approached, can either be a work of art or a disaster if theproper combinations are not found. It is the Quiche way to consciouslyevaluate everything from the outside world. If the item is judged to bebeneficial, it is then adapted to local custom, otherwise it is rejected. As aresult, nothing is ever felt to be strange or alien. In that way, the foundationsof life are not threatened. In this respect, the Quiche are quite remarkable.They are well defended against Europeans and their culture. Their approach totime may be a clue to how this immunity to cultural disintegration works (p.87). The K'iche' treat time as dialectic, meaning that at no given time past,present, or futureis it possible to isolate that time from the events that led up to itand which flow from it.K'iche' time and the daykeeping divination system demonstratethat, amongst the K'iche,' time is a sacred system, one's obligation to one's ancestorsreaches back and forward into time, a person is intimately related to the earth, itsnature spirits and the gods, and one has sacred relationships with, and obligations to,the larger community. This concept of time binds people to their ancestors, to God, tothe community and to daily life. In addition, the ability to divine using the movement ofblood is felt to be a gift from the ancestors.The CalendarsThe Cholq'ij, the Sacred Calendar or literally the days of the count, or the countof kin (the sun), is composed of thirteen numbers and twenty symbols (days). The daysof the sacred lunar calendar (called the Tzolkin and named by Thompson in the early1900s) are like the Western week with twenty days in place of seven; they are alsonamed after the gods. Along with the bar and dot notation used for numbers, thenumbers below twenty are also written in hieroglyphs, stylized human faces that depicteach number's disposition. The K'iche' also keep a solar calendar of 365 days containing18 months of 20 days with 5 remaining days. The two cycles, one lasting 260 days andthe other 365 days, mesh together to form the Calendar Round. On the combinedcalendar, the first day of the month on the solar calendar is called the Mam and isreferred to as the Year-bearer. In the Guatemala highlands, Barbara Ted lock (1992)found 34 Ixil, Mam, and Pokomchi towns still keep the 365-day cycle and the 260-daycycle linked by a system of Year-bearers. The grade three curriculum of the K'iche'people explains the Tzolkin as follows:We have a calendar that is sacred, because it shows the destiny of mankind. Ithas 260 days, divided into 13 months of twenty days each. The days aredivided into good and bad days. Each day had a Dueno (lord). The calendarhas an influence in the life of everyone everyday; there are good days formarriage, for selling, for curing diseases and for travelling. The calendar isalso linked up with agriculture; there are special days to pick the seeds, toprepare the earth, to plant, to thin and to harvest, and all this is lined up withthe phases of the moon (translated from the K'iche', Ri p. 46).During a 52 year cycle, a Baktun, every day has a unique name and meaninginterpreted by the diviners. The Tzolkin is divided further into four patterns or seasonsof 65 kin (day) each. The seasons also correspond to the four directions and to the Mayan Directional Guardians. The calendar system is then composed of kin (a Day),Uinal (20 kin), Tzolkin (290 days or 13 Uinals of 20 kin), a Tun (360 days 20 kinUinals), a Katun (20 Tuns7,200 days), a Baktun (20 Katuns), and the Creation Epoch,which equals 13 Baktuns. At this time, the K'iche' are living in the last 20-year period, aKatun of the Maya's Fifth Creation Epoch. This Katun completes on December 21, 2012ending three cycles of the Mayan calendar, the current Katun, the current Baktun, andthe current Creation Epoch.The twenty K'iche' day names are divine as well as proper names. Althoughthe names have been translated into Spanish and English, the names such as Satz(monkey) and /x(jaguar), are taken by daykeepers to be proper names within a contextof calendrical divination. A given day is interpreted by means of phrases that map themeanings of the day in terms of the social actions that characterize them. Names areread not as words, but as oral reference for other words using poetic sound play.The days have multiple interpretations including the \"face of the day\" and the\"character\" of the child born that day. There are elaborate ceremonies involved afterthe conception and birth of a child, which links up with its day and the mountain altarconnected to it. The mnemonic phrases for each day, the ceremonies performed on theday, its \"face\" and \"character,\" and some of the possible meanings of the day indifferent contexts, are all taught by daykeepers and are now being taught to Mayanchildren in many of the Mayan schools.The Quiche people speak a Mayan language, say prayers to Mayan mountainsand Mayan ancestors, and keep time according to the Mayan calendar. Theyare also interested citizens of the larger contemporary world, but they findthemselves surrounded and attacked by those who have yet to realize theyhave something to teach the rest of us. For them, it is not that the time of theMayan civilization has passed, to be followed by the time of the Europeancivilization, but that the two have begun to run alongside one another. Acomplete return to conditions existing before Europeans is unthinkable, as is acomplete abandonment of Indigenous traditions in favour of European ones.What most worries daykeepers about people from Europe, and specificallyabout missionaries, is that they confuse the earth, whose divinity is equal tothat of the celestial God, with the devil. As daykeepers put it, \"He who makesan enemy of the Earth makes an enemy of his own body.\"The Popol Vu/The Popol Vulis the K'iche' Maya book of creation and it is considered to beone of the most extraordinary texts of Indigenous America. Originally written inhieroglyphs, it was transcribed using the Spanish alphabet in the sixteenth century. Ittells the story of the creation and follows the deeds of the Maya Gods who founded the (86 Quiche kingdom in the Guatemalan highlands. In the preface to his translated versionof the Popol Vul, Dennis Tedlock (1985) writes that the authors who wrote the Popol Vulusing the Spanish alphabet did so \"in a time of much turmoil and difficulty;\" the authorswere writing \"amid the preaching of God, in Christendom now,\" and what they wrotethey described as \"the ancient word\" or \"prior word.\" Ted lock adds that their writingshave a plaintive tone although, at the same time, they state that their own gods\"accounted for everythingand did it, toofrom enlightened being, in enlightenedwords\" (p. 33).The original hieroglyphic Popol Vu /is described as a council book, containingaccounts of cycles of astronomical and earthly events that served as a guide for thosewho wished to see and move beyond the present. Ted lock (1985) believes that theancient reader of the Popo/ Vu/would use the book to give a reading or, on occasion, \"along performance and account\" whose subject was the emergence of the whole cahu /euor \"earth-sky,\" the K'iche' way of saying \"world.\" The council book is a long complexstory, which contains much traditional knowledge. It tells of the gods' attempts tocreate beings who will walk, talk, work, and pray in an articulate manner. They makeattempts to create human beings first from mud and then wood and only succeed whenthey use corn dough. The first people to be made from the corn dough are namedJaguar Quitze, Jaguar Night, Mahucutah, and True Jaguar. They become the first fourheads of the K'iche' patrilineages and are called the \"mother-fathers\" who serve as theritual symbolic and androgynous parents to everyone in their respective lineages.The Popo/ Vu/reveals much about the cosmology of present day K'iche' Mayathought and is the central sacred book now used in many of the Mayan schools. Mayanpeople today still consider dualities as complementary rather than opposed,interpenetrating rather than mutually exclusive. And instead of being in opposition toeach other, the realms of divine and human actions are joined by mutual attraction.To give you a sense of the Popol Vul, here is a brief excerpt from it ...We shall bring to light now because the Popol Vu /... cannot be seen anymore,in which was clearly seen coming from the other side of the sea ...The originalbook, written long ago, existed but its sight is hidden from the searcher andfrom the thinker.Great were the descriptions and the account of how all the earth was formed,how it was formed and divided into four parts; how it was partitioned and howthe sky was divided; and the measuring cord was brought, and it was stretchedover the sky and over the earth, on the four angles, on the four corners, aswas told by the Creator and the maker, the Mother and the Father of Life; of 8799 all created things, he who gives breath and thought, she who gives birth tochildren, he who watches over the happiness of the people, the happiness ofthe human race, the wise man, he who meditates on the goodness of all thatexists in the sky, on the earth, in the lakes and in the sea.A Woven World - Arts of RespectThe Mayan people of highland Guatemala and Chiapas follow a daily life wherethe sacred and the profane intertwine. All aspects of life are part of a tradition that theMaya say God gave them at the beginning of the world. In many highland villages,women still weave much of the families' clothing. The huiplls, the large rectangularblouses women wear, bear elaborate geometric designs that describe the Mayancosmos.Chip Morris (1987) has lived and worked with weavers in Chiapas for decades.He became fascinated with the ancient language of symbols woven into Mayancostumes, and has spent most of his life working with them. He writes that theydescribe:Weavers capture the moment when the world is renewed ...Ceremonialgarments are woven with designs that for millennia, have depicted the Mayacosmos and the supernatural beings that make the world flower. Living Mayaculture has preserved much of the ancient traditions at the deepest layer ofbelief. Influences from the Aztecs, the Spanish, and modern technocrats havebeen absorbed into a profound and complex culture ...Every act, even one ashumble as sweeping, is given dignity and importance in the world describedthrough myths. Today's daily chores making tortillas, cutting wood, weavingare the same chores performed by the heroes and gods at the beginning oftime, acts that began the world and that keep it alive (pp. 11-35).According to Agustin Sapon Morales, a weaver and Director of Pop Atziak, a MayanCultural Centre:At the beginning of the world, our ancestors created the art of weavingbecause clothes were needed for the two grandchildren ...The children neededclothes because the weather was so harsh. The grandmother was interested insolving the problem. One day, while she was up in the mountains thinkingabout how to resolve her grandchildren's needs, she happened to see a spidermoving its thread from side to side in the bushes. And as she watched, thespider started to weave.Today's huipils resemble the classic Mayan designs worn over twelve hundredyears ago. A huipil encloses a woman in her sacred space. The opening of a woman'shuipil is usually encircled with a sacred design such as flowers or diamonds. When awoman weaves, she continues a tapestry created by her ancestors. Agustin Moralesexplains:10088 Weaving is something very important in culture, because our ancestors puttheir memories into their weaving. They expressed all of their experiences andfeelings in weaving. Everything in the weaving has a symbolic meaning. Infact, that is what the name of our organization, Pop Atziak, means, \"TheHistory of Weaving\"the history of the Mayan people which is represented inthe weaving (Personal communication, Totonicapan).The huipil is believed to be a mirror of the universe and a portal to the Earthlord's cave. Morris (1987) explains this in more detail:The design of the universe is woven, with clarity and purpose, line by line, intoMaya cloth. The weaver maps the motion of the sun through the heavens andthe underworld, through time and space. A Mayan woman weaves theuniverse as it awakens. When a Mayan woman puts on her huipil, sheemerges through the neck hole symbolically in the axis of the world. Thedesigns of the universe radiate from her head, extending over the sleeves andbodice of the huipil to form an open cross with the woman in the middle. Herethe supernatural and the natural meet. Here, in the very centre of a worldwoven from dreams and myths, she stands between heaven and theunderworld (p. 108).Some weavers are reluctant to talk about the meaning of woven motifs as wellas other sacred teachings and are generally more concerned with creating their weavingthan with describing it, but others, like Agustin Sapon Morales, are committed tobringing these teachings to the public, especially to the children. He explains that thereare rules for the placement of motifs in a huipil, but they are flexible rules. A weaverwill never make the exact design twice; there is always a small change, so that eachpiece is unique. The motif of a field of diamond-shaped designs is sacred an ancientMayan concept of space and time. Agustin Sapon Morales explains the significance ofcolour.Blue signifies space. It also symbolizes the presence of the creator, heart ofthe sky. The creator is both the heart of the sky and the heart of the earth.Green stands for mother earth. Everything is part of mother earth. It alsosymbolizes the essence of Mayan spirituality. And then there are the symbols,zigzags, lightning flashes, stars, nets and animals of all sorts in a riot,monkeys, scorpions, jaguars, bats, turkeys, hummingbirds. There aredifferences in the meaning of a piece of fabric depending upon the weaver'sfamily and the community in which she lives; the composition of the piece, itscolours and symbols can be read like a book (Personal communication).In Guatemala, the most intricate ceremonial costumes are those worn bymarried women, but young girls still weave the brightest colours. Until quite recently, inmany villages, a man would not marry a woman who could not weave. Most weaving isstill done for the immediate family, but more and more women produce textiles for sale. 891 0 1 Textiles are also sold from one community to another; for example, the men ofMomostenango make most of the woolen blankets for all of Guatemala. Weaving isconsidered both art and work, a form of teaching and of learning. Little girls may beginto learn some basic techniques as early as four or five, but are not expected to producea usable piece of clothing until they are seven or eight.Weaving - Arts of ResistanceFor the Maya, the best way to resist the colonial order, which imposed its ownviews, was to preserve and transmit the experience of one's own culture, language andidentity. Meanings embodied in today's weavings are still social, bodily and magical.These weavings are textiles of resistance, a society's fortress of the soul maintainedthroughout the centuries; an encoded identity worn like an armour of cotton. Margaritade Ore liana considers Mayan weaving as another history of consciousness, where thetextiles become the warp in the mindset of a time. De Ore liana outlines four paths inunderstanding our relationship to these textiles. The first involves the immediacy oftheir beauty, a beauty that is in stark contrast to the grim reality of current Mayan life.On a second path, the textiles are viewed as a social sign, an index of one's positionwithin the community as depicted by each garment, an outer emblem of one'scommunity worn in front of others as an individual and collective identity. A third pathinvolves the forest of symbols, where the encoded meaning of a community emergeslike a universal tree of life, both grounded and aerial. Agustin Sapon Morales explainssome of this symbolism:The bird is a figure which is never absent from our weavings. The birdsymbolizes earth, the presence of mother earth, a bird can fly, it can gowherever it wants. No limits or borders. This is the feathered serpent.According to the beliefs of our ancestors, the feathered serpent represents thegreat sovereign, the invisible god. What our ancestors want to tell us aboutthis figure is that it twists and turns, it represents the course of our life as aperson. Our life is always like this. A reptile winds it way through the patternslike a serpent between the earth and sky. Two-headed birds are symbols ofthe Maya concept of dark and light, good and bad (Personal communication).In the fourth path, textiles are seen as part of a wider imaginary warp, whichincludes the play of images that weavers have of themselves and of their tradition. It isa dialogue between the collective imaginations that form the texture of a present worldview or mindset. Agustin Sapon Morales explains:Cot is a two-headed eagle.It's an image referring to Mayan spirituality. WhenMaya priests receive the bara, the staff which symbolizes the priests'responsibilities, they are able to make predictions. They can tell what 10290 problems there are likely to be. But always with reference to what hashappened in the past. That's why the eagle has two heads. It sees into thefuture as well as the past. What this reminds us of is that we have both afuture and a past. It also means fertilization, birth and destiny. These threesymbols mean a lot to people. And that's why they are always in Mayanweaving. Our ancestors always said what has happened in the past in eachperson's life must not be forgotten. But we must think too, about the presentand the future (Personal communication).Andres Fabregas Puig writes,The play of symbols embodied a knowledge as in the codices, for examplewhich revealed collective talent, while consolidating a resistance culture thatchose the route of art to safeguard the heritage of its ancestors, to save it fromthe hands of the colonizer and place it daily in the hands of present and futuregenerations. The practice is so deep rooted that, today, textiles from Chiapasserve as a guide to understanding how that culture views the cosmos and howit preserves itself, transforming on its own terms and maintaining its identity.History and culture are intertwined on these textiles. They confirm the diversepaths open to society and bear witness to the force of identities that wereformerly denied (translated from the Spanish, in Artes de Mexico (1996):Weaving a fortress: textiles from Chiapas: the epitome of a resistance culture).A generation or two ago, all clothing worn in highland Guatemala and Chiapaswas handspun and woven. Now, most men buy and wear western-style clothing, and itis not uncommon for women to wear factory made sweaters over their huipils. Thediscarding of traditional dress by the men is thought to have been one way of avoidingthe rampant racism in Guatemala, and may have also been one way to avoididentification of one's community by the army, since each community can be identifiedby its traje. The French photojournalist, Jean-Marie Simon, has photographed armybriefing sessions on identifying highland trajes which have been published in her book,Guatemala, Eternal Spring, Eternal Tyranny. Evangelic missionaries have condemnedthe \"pagan\" motifs and insisted that weavers alter these designs, foreign designers havetaught weavers how to use different colours and have influenced the use of motifs aswell as the designs to suit the fickle international market. I concur with several humanrights researchers who believe the attempt to change and distort the ancient motifs ofthe Mayan loom is part of a larger plan of cultural genocide meant to fracture the Mayanpeople from their land and culture.Weaving - Tapestries of EnduranceThe imaginary threads of the past and present are woven into the threads ofhuipil, wore as a surrogate skin of beauty, protection and identity connecting the weaverwith the heart of the sky and the heart of the earth. And today, in the humble little 9110 3 highland schools of Guatemala, Mayan children continue to weave the world into being.Excerpt From Reuters\"Guatemala's Mayans Living Renaissance after Accord\"SAN ANTONIO PALOPO, Guatemala, May 14, 1999In an unprecedented victory for Mayan groups, Guatemala's EducationMinister, last month, ordered school officials in the country's second largest city,Quetzaltenango, to allow two Mayan students to wear traditional dress after they hadbeen threatened with expulsion for refusing to wear the school's uniform.Under a ring of flaming blue volcanoes, hundreds of Mayan children in brighttraditional costumes wound silently through the narrow village streets. Parents andneighbours gazed proudly at the procession, part of a Mayan ritual last month to heraldthe new millennium. Young priests chanted through loudspeakers and scatteredaromatic pine needles. It was a display of ethnic pride and tradition that would havebeen almost unheard of 10 years ago. Encouraged by the end of 36 years of civil warbetween the army and Marxist rebels, a renaissance is brewing in Guatemala's Mayanworld. After 500 years of discrimination, Mayans are seeking to establish themselves aspart of the country's public life, and to gain respect for their religion, language and civilrights.Indian TapestryWhen I go up to the house of the old weaver,I watch in admirationat what comes forth from her mind;a thousand designs being createdand not a single model from which to copythe marvellous clothwith which she will dressthe companion of the True and Faithful One.Men always ask meto give the name of the label,to specify the maker of the design.But the weaver cannot be pinned downby designsnor patterns,All of her weavings are originals,there are no repeated patterns.Her mind is beyond all foresight.Her able hands do not accept patterns or models.Whatever comes forth, comes forth,but she who is will make it. 492 The colours of the threadsare firm,blood,sweat,perseverance,tears,struggle,and hope.Colours that do not fadewith time. The children of the childrenof our childrenwill recognize the sealof the Old weaver.maybe thenit will receive a name.but as a model,it can never againbe repeated.Each morning I have seenhow her the threadsone one.Her loom mengive no the less,the designthat emerges from Mindhour after hourwill appear in the threadsof many colours,in figures and symbolswhich no one ever again,will be able to eraseor undo. by Julia Esquivel from Threatened with Resurrection Addenda A Recent Interview with Agustin Sapon Morales(translated by Robin June Hood) The Creator and the Former has allowed me once again to be with you in thisvillage. So with his permission, I'd love to talk for a minute with the youth. I'm reallyemotional to see you here working together. I want to encourage (exaltarles) you towork together and to move forward. I'm going to share with you a little bit of myknowledge, which is my people's understanding who are the Maya. For me, ourculture is worth a lotit has great value.Each Indian Native has its special way (convocar) of thinking and looking at theworld. It has its way of calling to the Creator. It has its way of speaking with MotherNature.I want to tell youI've just come from a conference where we had anexchange of experiences with other Indian brothers who have had the same visions.We have the same beliefs. Our roots are well planted. So, I'd like to talk specificallyabout a few things. Above all we have to askwho are we? Where did we comefrom? and where are we going?I would like to talk about the meaning of \"balance.\" It's so important I'll usethe blackboard so you can understand this more deeply.We all know that we are human beings you know what a human being isall of you. How can we illustrate this? In my culture, we do it like this so weunderstand the totality of a place - in the Mayan culturea place is composed of 20energies. So we'll see with all of you where we find these 20 energies. Our ancestorsstudied what it meant to be a person, where do you find these 20 energies in ourbodies? I have a hand with five fingers and so do you - and we all have another handworth five fingers. Adding these two hands there are 10 energiesand the five toesof the right footthat makes 15 energiesplus five toes from the left foot. So we geta total of 20 energies. Each digit represents an energy that we all have as peopleeach digit has a function. For example, with the index finger, we can use it to hold ontoa pen or pencil. This other finger, if we are writing with a typewriter each finger has afunction. It means our fingers don't just have form, they also have functions. If we 106 are missing a finger from the handit's incomplete, it would mean we are missing theneeded energy.We are speaking of a complete person with their 20 digitsin the Mayanculturethe calendar is made up of 20 days - each day has a function; for example,today is a special day for doing ceremonies. In Quiche, the name of the day is writtenlike this \"Toh\" (July 17, 13 Toh YucateeMuluc). In Spanish \"pago\" payment, theday of payment, of sacrifice.Every day, we have certain things or a relationship with our Creator. Thereare many ways that we offend the Creator now. So what do we do about all theseerrors that we commit daily?We pay a fine or we offer a ceremony an offering. Another way we canreconcile ourselves with the Creator is to pray. To recognize our weaknesses that'sone thing. So talking about what forms a person all human beings need to maintainbalance.I'll draw it for you. We'll make a triangle. In our lines as human beings, it'svery important that we don't forget about the Former and the Creator. That's the mostimportant thing. In the second place is nature, and in the third place is the person. Sothese are the three things we have to uphold with us everyday.As a person, we have to maintain a relationship with the Former and theCreator everyday. And it's important that the Creator stays with us everyday. Aspeople, we should always maintain a relationship with nature. As human beings, wemust maintain a relationship with Mother Nature everyday. Again, as human beings, wemust maintain a relationship with Mother Nature everyday. Mother Nature is with ustoo, every day. And Mother Nature has a relationship with the Former and the Creatoras well. And the Creator manifests in many ways daily in nature. So we have arelationship with the Former and the Creator and with Mother Nature. So how can weincrease this relationship? As human beings, to have a good relationship with theCreator, we should give thanks for our life. Give thanks for life and all the elements thatsustain usour goodgive thanks for the knowledge that we have Give greetings(thanks) as we get up, give greetings at mid day, and give thanks at dusk. In allmoments of our life. And why is this necessary? Because our life depends on theFormer and the Creator. Because, now, he's giving us our opportunity to talk together.So, we have to be thankful for that because the Creator can speak with us becausehe's with good health. 9510 7 So, if we think about itthere are many benefits we are receiving all the timefrom the Former and the Creator. So these are ways to maintain a relationship with theCreator. In the Mayan culture, when a child is born, the midwife, upon receiving a childin her arms, gives thanks to the Creator that a new being has been born. Andimmediatelya ceremony is done. This is a way of giving thanks; this is how theCreator has given life to the mother. In many ways, and through many forms, we canhave a relationship with we Creator.Also, there are many ways of having a relationship with Mother Nature wemust not hurt her in any way not to destroy nature in any way. Plants have life likeus.It's important to take care of them. Also, we should have a lot of respect forMother Nature. We need to give thanks for the air that is given to us without air wecouldn't live. Another thing we need to give thanks for is the rain, because of rain wehave our elementscrops. So we make ceremonies to give thanks to Mother Nature. Idon't know if, here, you have a ceremony to give thanks to Mother Earth? If you doyou must continue doing that.To maintain this relationship, one has to dance to maintain happiness andjoyfulness in this relationship with the Creator through sacred dancing. There aresacred dances that one does during ceremony - but don't confuse these with those youdo in a dance hall. These dances they don't have value in our culture. I've seen alittle how people dance rock it's like someone is crazy. By contrast, the dance of ourancestors is sacred and done with much respect. Perhaps, the reason why the world isout of balance now is because we haven't maintained this relationship with the Formerand the Creator. The cultures that have come here, and in my country, in the conquest,are ones of destruction. And they attempted to break our relationship here, here andhere (he draws a triangle).In school, I never learned this kind of education and I imagine that's the samewith you here now. In the big universities, they do not yet teach the proper relationshipwith the Former and the Creator.So, to maintain a relationship with ourselves, it's very necessary to respect theElders. So how do we do this? We do this through respect in the Maya culture, theway we should respect the Elders is obedience. Also, when a child gets up, they haveto bow their heads to the Elder, and the grandfather puts his right hand on the child'shead. That's the signal of protection. When finishing eating the sacred elements(meal), children say thanks father, mother, abuelo, hermanos. This is the best way to maintain respect. The response that the grandparents and Elders give is one that Godhas given this to you. So the reason they say this, is that it isn't just from them thatthey could eatbut from the Creator the food has been provided.Something else about respect it's important that we identify ourselves asIndian people. So, we shouldn't be ashamed of our languages, of our dress, of ourcustomsthere are many thingsand we shouldn't be ashamed of them.Unfortunately, the education that we got in school, they have never taught us any ofthese things. But respect is real and important to communication. It's important to talkwith other people, with friends, talk about our lives, talk about our relationship with theCreator, talk about Mother Nature. This is respect that we must share among ourselvesas people.It's really important that these three things be taken into account. Weshouldn't forget about the Creator and Mother Nature. As people, we shouldn't feelsuperiorwe shouldn't feel superior to anything in nature we're a part of MotherNature. From the Mother Earth comes seeds also from Mother Earthwhen we dieI think your custom is the same as ours that is, when you have to be buried in theearthyes or no? What is your custom? So Mother Earth receives us when we aredead in her armsit's like our Mother who gives us affection and that's how it is withMother Earth. It's a Mayan custom to kiss the Mother Earth three times before you'regoing to work the earth or plant you must ask permission from the Creator and fromMother Earthsaying this prayer: Heart of the SkyHearth of the EarthPlease permit me to touch or damage your sacred creationMother NaturePlease forgive me if I damage your faceI only do this only of necessity because I'm hungryForgive me.And then you kiss it three times this is the way of asking permission. Every day,farmers do this. And after they're finished their work of the day many give thanks forhaving being given that day of work in the country. These experiences of our (Elders)ancestors are really important for our lives they give us a very straight road, importantteachersso our young people must appreciate the wisdom of our ancestors.Perhaps in schoolthey have said that your ancestors were ignorant thatthey weren't people but savage animals but NO they were Indian people they were 1,09 philosophersthey had great knowledgethey studied what we know as astronomy,they understood and measured time, they knew how many asteroids there were inspace. What has happenedis that they weren't given the opportunity to advance inthese sciences when the foreign invasion conquesthappened in each country.That's when the science of our ancestors ended. So today, with young people, we haveto work to recover this. Because everywhere in the world Mother Nature and theenvironment is being destroyed in my country there are great droughts, and why arethese number of droughts happening? Because of lack of respect for Mother Nature.And does the European culture give thanks to the Mother when they areopening up a road? Does the logger kiss the earth three times before he moves into theforest? This European culture they feel superior to nature and, at the same time, theyoften don't even have respect for people.During the invasionhow many of our ancestors were assassinated by theseinvaders? For what was important to them was \"wealth,\" \"riches\" they wanted to bemillionaires. It didn't matter to them if it was Mother Nature or if it was a person, theydestroyed it. So comparing this to the beliefs of the Europeans it's completelydifferent. Maybe this is difficult to understand but we have to make the effort. Andwhere is this knowledge? It's in the grandfather here with other peopleyou musttalk with them.Maybe our grandfather here does not have a book where he can show youthis, but the great book that he has is his memory, his experience, of how to maintain arelationship with the Creator. And of how to relate to Mother Nature and how to treateach other as people. But, I don't want to get you tired - maybe you're tired now. ButI ask you to respect your parents and Elders - this is a beautiful thing to respect yourElders. Respect means to take into account the instructions they give us if they correctusto listen to that and not to oppose them. Because, if you do that, you are sinningin front of the Creator- and Mother Naturebecause, as people, we bring this alltogether.So thanksmaybe another time we can talk more. To finish, I think it'simportant - perhaps Spanish is as hard for you as English is for us and we have a bookcalled Mayan Translationso that she translates it into English. What's important rightnow is the combination of ideas so that we can recreate our Indian identity together. So I'll finish with a phrase:As Indian nationsBefore the invasionWe were a big treeWith large branches and many leaves and fruitsOur waist was largeWhen the invaders cameThey began to cut the fruitOur grandfathers cut our leavesThey left the branches bareThey left is without branchesWith gunshots now it's sure they've cut our trunkBut they couldn't destroy our rootsand how they're growing upthe tree is growing againIt has branches, and flowersand one day we'll have fruits.

Some of you may well beasking why I have chosen the tunutellek as my subject for this occasion? The Yupiaqname means \"that which is packing something.\" Indeed, the loon is carrying a heavyburden.Wherever the loon exists, there are Native people, and you will have many loonstories that are mystical and magical in their content. Among them is the story of theblind boy who is made to see by the loon diving into the water with the boy on its back.This is repeated three times. With each dive and emergence, the boy could see a littleclearer and, on its third emergence, the boy could see clearly. The loon helped the boyto see and, likewise, it can help us to understand ourselves and see our connection toMother Earth today.Listen to the call of the loon. Its call is God-given through nature. It has itsown language and is understood by others of its kind and other creatures. Only we,with our ability to think and rationalize, do not understand, because we listen only withthe mind, not with mind and heart well sprinkled with intuition. To some, the call iseerie, as if some bad thing is about to happen. Maybe an alangguk, an apparition ofsome kind, is about to appear. It conjures up many thoughts that are not based on\"what is,\" but on \"what if.\" This is the fear that most of us face as a Native people,especially when thinking about changing education. \"What if\" the educators, legislatorsand powers that be do not believe that this could be done? But, regardless, we musttake those steps necessary to change education so that it takes into consideration, infact makes, an educational system based on our own tribal worldviews. When thoughtof in that context, then it includes our Native languages, ways of generating knowledge,research, ways of making things, and ways for using them respectfully.Our Native languages come from the land. They are derived from the land. Itis the language of the land that makes our Native people live in harmony with nature.101113 According to the Muskogee Cree, Bear Heart, harmony is a tolerance, a forgiving, ablending. This is what our Native languages allow us to do. Our Native words comefrom the creatures and things of Mother Earth naming themselves, defining themselvesthrough action wordsthat's reality! Nature is our teacher. Information and rationalityare a small segment of knowing and learning. In the use of our Native languages, wecome to live life intimately, because we are enmeshed in it rather than looking at it froma distance through a microscope or telescope. It then behooves that we relearn ourlanguages and learn to live close to nature to regain our health as a Native people.When we have that vision and goal, and work toward it, then we will have harmony; wewill have tolerance; we will forgive; and we will again blend into our world. We will beusing our five senses and intuition to learn about our place. The loon never lost itsspiritual vision. It has a love for life, its environment and its creator. Its education wasfrom Mother Earth for the heart, for it to become creative and to know how to live in itscommunity, its habitat.The loon still gets messages from its unconscious with new thoughts orsolutions to problems. We, as human beings, have cluttered up our conscious mindswith information and rational thinking, so that our world of dreams is no longer soughtthrough meditation, vision questing, fasting and looking deep into the silence within usfor direction. Not only have we become socio-politico-economic dependants, but wedepend on outside sources to take care of our problems, whether it's individual, familyor community. You see, the loon looks into its inner ecology knowing that no one elsecan do that for it.It knows that it is incumbent upon itself to look out for its owninterests. In order for us to receive guidance and direction for our lives, we mustrelearn what the loon does naturally. We must look into ourselves where power andstrength lie and tap into it to begin to address our own problems.Another strength of the loon is that it teaches and nurtures its young to live asa loon. It does not require that someone else do the educating. The loon develops theloon worldview of its young closely connected to others and its place. As it migratesfrom place to place, it remembers and appreciates the diversity and beauty of nature. Itnurtures its offspring to become independent, yet knowing its dependence on theabundance of nature to succor its needs. It teaches its young to \"do unto others as youwould have them do unto you.\" This is true love; this is unconditional love that weneed in this world. A love for self, a love for others, and a love for place, giving one asense of responsibility to take care of oneself, to care for others and the environment114102 that one lives in. The loon's cry is remembering a place that was harmonious, full of thebeauty and diversity that nature so loves. This is heart talk! This is science knowingplace.Very much like our Native people, the loon's life is not all roses and peace.The loon has a few problems, such as taking off. It is very much like the Wrightbrothers in their early experiments at becoming airborne. The little home-made enginerevs up, but has just enough power for it to barely get off the ground. Just as theunder-powered plane, the loon frantically flaps its wings and seemingly runs across thewater's surface. Once in awhile, the loon will crash onto the tundra, but it crawls backinto the lake somehow and tries again. We, as a Native people, are testing our wingsand power! If we find that some of our ideas do not work, we need to go back and tryagain, maybe with a different approach and tools. We must not be overly ambitious byoverplaying our knowledge and abilities, but recognize our limitations as human beings.We must do that which we know we can succeed at first, and then progress to moredifficult tasks. If we fail, we must NEVER GIVE UP!The sad fact about this precious bird, the loon, is that it is losing ground in itsefforts to survive. Our Canadian friends look upon it with great respect so much sothat it is on their one- and two-dollar coins. They are called the \"loonie\" and \"twoonie\".It is a known fact that the loon numbers are growing smaller at a fast rate across theNorth. There is a problem that is so ominous and insidious that it is overwhelming theloon. It is not of its own making. It is human-made pollution of chemical, biological,nuclear and noise, which is destroying its habitat. It is we, humans, who are destroyingits habit and, unfortunately, as we destroy its habitat, we are destroying ourselves inthe process.The loon may well ask, \"What was the question that makes technology theanswer in the first place? Who asked it and when?\" Technology is the product ofhuman rationality, though it is inherently neutral, until it is put to use for some humanpurpose. Take, for example, the computer. Some think it has the capacity to solvemany of our problems. It is speedy and answers questions with facts the humans havefed into it. However, I say use it sparingly, as a tool. Too often, it encouragesindividualism to the point of isolationism. The excessive user wants to be alone with astupid machine. If you feed it garbage, you get garbage in return. It takes away clearthinking, problem-solving skills and, above all, removes common sense. 1.15103 Modern technology lends weight to a society that is inclined to take and takefrom the natural environment, to make things without giving back. It wants to cut intoMother Earth to remove its natural resources. It entices people to want more of itsproducts. In so doing, Indigenous people, creatures, plants and landforms become thevictims of Euro-centric concepts of progress and development. They are merelyremoved as detritus and, in the process, we destroy a people and their place. Theloon's mournful cry is in recognition of this needless destruction that is taking place by\"bigger and better\" technological machines of devastation.The mournful cry of the loon is much aware of its dwindling food sources, theinability of some of its eggs to hatch, and its members succumbing to poisons and newdiseases.It recognizes that to not have children, to not have family, to not have acommunity, is to be scattered, to be falling apart. Many of our Native families arefalling apart. It recognizes that there are healthy Native families in the villages. But, Iwould say that these healthy families are too often surrounded by, and are witnesses to,a holocaust of pain and misery. Our villages are, in essence, communities in name only.They are often not working together for the common good as in the old days. Theunhealthy and dysfunctional families have youngsters seven, eight or nine years old whoare raising and taking care of their younger siblings. Why should I worry about theseyoung children acting as parents? Because these youngsters are missing an importantaspect of their young livesthat of being a child! A child is to be loved by parents, tobe nurtured and taken care of by parents, to play as a child, to talk as a child, toimagine as a child. Oh, the yearning of the child just to be a child! Many children missthis growing-up phase.As if this was not enough, we allow video games, movies and television tobecome babysitters while we go out and party, play bingo, gamble, and do things thatmake us sicker. While the children are viewing and doing these things, they are seeingkilling, cheating, lying, men beating women and children, all kinds of sex, adultlanguage, and all other undesirable aspects of life. The mournful cry of the loon isreminding us of the time when there were secrets from children, things that were not tobe known by them until they were considered ready. Today, there are no secrets in themodern media. Go out on the playground, a school party, or anywhere youngsters aregathered. Listen to their language! You will hear a lot of foul language. The languagethat the youngsters use is an indicator of how bad the situation has become. There isno respect for parents, teachers, elders and, most certainly, for other young people. 116104 We see children having children, children killing children, children killing elders, childrencommitting suicide, children dropping out of school, children without hope sadchildren. What a sad state for us to be in!These states of affairs contribute to the loss of childhood. We must gaincontrol of what the children learn, see and do. We do this by regaining control of ourown lives. We control this by turning off the television during dinner time so that hearttalk can take place. Heart talk is kind, gentle talk that makes one want to be polite toeveryone and everything around them. This talk allows members to know each other,what their likes and dislikes are, to know of problems they are having with friends,siblings and school. It allows the family to find out what they would like to see changein the home and why. This is where a family that loves and talks together becomesstronger because they know each other, love and care for one another. This is family.The loon does not blame anyone even though its environment is rife withproblems and pollution beyond its control. Its mournful call reminds us that we, ashumans, must do our part to regenerate and reciprocate with nature. We, the Nativepeople, must quit blaming others for our problems. When we blame others, we aresaying that someone else should take care of the problem and deal with our feelingsabout the situation. We don't like what has been happening in the schools, so weblame the state, district and teachers. We are saying to them, \"take care of theproblem,\" and \"take care of my hurt and confused feelings about my own education.Please, heal me.\" Why should we continue to do this? Why should we continue to sayhow confused and mixed-up we are by the new civilization that has come to ourvillages?Now, we have frame houses that are poorly insulated, built on stilts andexpensive to maintain. But, we are \"educated,\" because we no longer live in sodhouses. We have snowmobiles instead of dog teams that can often save our lives. Wehave flush toilets with Lysol cleaners that empty into an unhealthy lagoon, therebymaking it unnecessary for us to go outdoors in all kinds of weather, whereby nature cantake care of natural wastes in a natural way. But, we are educated. We haveantibiotics and hormone-laced hamburgers instead of smoked dry fish which is morehealthful. We use toilet paper which kills trees instead of sphagnum moss whichprevents rash and the spread of germs. But, are we educated! So well educated as tothink our Native languages and cultures are no longer useful. This is what the loon is 105 mourning. Why have we, the Native people, given up? Giving up has been a verycostly venture to us as a Native people. But, we are educated.The loon's standards of life and making a living are impeccable, thus allowing itto live successfully for many thousands of years. Its basic standard is respect arespect for the Greater Being, spirits, others' rights to live a life that fits their needs, anda respect for the environment. It is taught aspects of its place by its parents using allfive senses. The young are taught how to play; taught the rituals of swimming, divingand making its call; taught how to select a nesting place; taught the art of making anest; taught to appreciate the life forms within its place; and taught to live a life that isinteracting with all that is around it. It knows that it is a loon and will always rememberthat. Yes, its standards are simple and intertwined, leading to a life that is full ofmeaning and direction.For those of us who are Indigenous or Native people, we must resurrect ourways of recognizing and paying homage to the El lam Yua spirits and nature. When weregain our spirituality; we will again learn to laugh from our hearts and play because\"those who know how to play can easily leap over the adversaries of life. And one whoknows how to sing and laugh never brews mischief' (an Iglulik proverb). When weawake at dawn and look at the sun rising and life begins to stir again, this is mysterious.The loon is telling us of this mystery of life its mysterious connection to us. This issacred. When we begin to understand this, we will begin to change our relationshipwith our environment. We will begin to experience a need for a new existence. I amhappy to state that among the Alaska Native people, the Yupiat have striven for, andare heading for, a new existence! We have many Yupiat Elders and others who havebecome teachers for all of us, and all point to the same direction a new consciousnessfor life. A new consciousness that is vibrantly traditional, full of truth, beauty, health,happiness and love. These five attributes of life provide the foundation for the answersto the questions that each and every one of us will ask ourselves as to the type of lifethat we want to pursue. As we put this into practice, we will become the models ofexistence for now and in the future.In this contemporary world of chaos, we can create our own reality. We canre-create ourselves as we want to be. We have the power within us to do this. Wehave three things that will help us to do this. First, we have our past through myths,stories, rituals and ceremonies. We can draw from them that which will help usreconstruct, and dispense with those that will not be of help to us in our efforts. 118106 Secondly, we have our imagination and ability to see what we would like to bein the future. What will we look like? What will we live in? How will we make ourliving? What kinds of things will we possess? How will we recognize the spiritual?Lastly, we have our rational, thinking minds that react to things around us and,thus, enable us to connect with things as they are now. We know what we are, knowwhat others think of us, know how we try to make a living, know how the federal andstate governments work against us, and know how we react to negative, as well aspositive, things that happen to us. Knowing these time and thought spirals can help usto reconstruct our reality and ourselves.It is time that we make songs about alcohol and drugs, telling of their powerover us, telling us it is now time for us to give up and be released from their use, andgive up or relinquish our emotional ties to these destructive elements. If we merelyrelease these from our lives, we will return to them. So it is absolutely necessary thatwe give up our emotional ties to these, i.e., I do it because it makes me feel good andallows me to talk and mix with people. This is an emotional tie that will get you back toit.The loon reminds us that its standards for life are high, and so should ours be.In looking at the federal and state educational standards, I get confused as to the realmeaning of them. Perhaps it's the fragmented and convoluted approach by fields ofstudy that make this so. It does not show me a need for a change in education. Thereis an old Chinese saying that goes something like this: \"When there is someone pointingat the moon, only the idiot looks at the finger!\" These Euro-centric standards requirethat we look at the content of the various fields of study. They tell us what ourstudents are purportedly to know at the end of secondary school. Content, thusinformation accumulation and processing, seems to be of overriding importance. As I'vesaid before, information and rationality are a very small part of learning. But thosealone fail to give direction and wholeness to the standards. This is not to say that theyare useless; but, they can be if left alone.The needed additional ingredients are the Alaska Standards for CulturallyResponsive Schools.' These say to me that there needs to be a change in the whole ofeducation, not only schooling. Schooling is that which happens in the structure calledthe school. Education is that which happens within and outside the family, school, and See attached addendum. '71 if 9 community. The latter is all-inclusive. In reading and thinking about the standards, Iget the distinct feeling that there is a need to change the way that we teach, the thingsthat we teach about, the materials we use, how we measure growth and development,and where things are taught. The cultural standards behoove us to make sure thatsomething is done to accommodate the Native thought-worlds and worldviews. Theloon would desire this for its survival and ours. We are now on that pathway.In conclusion, the cry of the loon is encouraging us to balance our physical,emotional, intellectual and spiritual selves to begin to live lives that feel just right,walking peacefully and expressing it to others in our own Native languages. PiurciqukutYu luta pitallketuluta -\"we will become people living a life that feels just right.\"Quyana! Addendum Alaska Standards for Culturally Responsive SchoolsThrough a series of regional and statewide meetings associated with the AlaskaRural Systemic Initiative (with funding provided by the National Science Foundation andthe Annenberg Rural Challenge, and administrative support from the Alaska Federationof Natives, in collaboration with the University of Alaska), Alaska Native educators havedeveloped the \"Alaska Standards for Culturally Responsive Schools\" for consideration byeducators serving Native students around the state. Though the emphasis is on ruralschools serving Native communities, many of the standards are applicable to allstudents and communities because they focus curricular attention on in-depth study ofthe surrounding physical and cultural environment in which the school is situated, whilerecognizing the unique contribution that Indigenous people can make to such study aslong-term inhabitants who have accumulated extensive specialized knowledge related tothat environment.The cultural standards outlined in this document are not intended to beinclusive, exclusive or conclusive, and, thus, should be reviewed and adapted to fit localneeds. Each school, community and related organization should consider which of thesestandards are appropriate and which are not, and when necessary, develop additionalcultural standards to accommodate local circumstances.

My story sits inmy heartit aches with grief, stiffens with old fear, then flutters with remembering thatI survivedit's over.I never have to go back there to be victimized again. My mindswimsdodging the piercing images that replay on any slight trigger from my day asound, a smell, a situation that holds some minute similarity to the way I wasvictimized. My body moves forward or shrinks back releasing emotions or holding itin. In the library, I hold it in at home, I shed my tears. This is my experience as Iattempt to write about Native healing journeys.Today, I am thirty-six years old. Thirty years have passed, yet I am notcompletely free of my pain. Yesterday, I met with three friends a Metis woman, awhite woman, and a white man. We took turns telling what happened to us we cried,yelled, and screamed, but mostly we told; we told every detail that we have held insideourselvesin our throats, in our bowels, arms, legs, faces, eyes, minds all havingbeen silent and stiff with terror for years.Telling our stories to each other has brought us a growing freedom from ourpast hurts. By telling our stories, we have contradicted the fear of telling, the \"need\" tobe silent, the shame of having been sexually abused. The more we tell what happenedto us, the more we rise above and out of our imprisonment and isolation. As Hill (1995)writes, \"One of the hardest steps in recovery is to tell one's secrets, to look into the pastand to explore all the painful memories and circumstances, and bring them into theopen. But recovery must also be emotional healing. It is not enough to just talk aboutpainful memories. We need to look at the memories, deal with the emotions attachedto those memories, and release the pain\" (p. 97). 121133 We have made a commitment to each other to meet once a month to work onour early sexual memories, because they are the memories that keep us feelingashamed, acting as if we had a choice in being victimized as children. The feeling ofpowerlessness has a lasting and almost permanent impact on us, as described by Bagleyand King (1990):Repeated invasions of the child's territory and body space reinforce his or herself-perception as a victim. Prolonged assaults may lead to a permanent senseof powerlessness in the victim, and an inability to avoid further victimization,be it sexual, social, or economic (p. 116).I know that the work I do on my childhood sexual abuse will help me in my lifeas a parent, I can see how it helps me give my child the love and care she needs. Ithelps me get my life backget myself back. Kunzman (1990) writes about parentsbeing afraid of passing the abuse on or that the chaos they experienced will affect theirown parenting.I do this healing work to be the best parent I can be, so that my childwill at least have a good start in life.Yesterday, we ended our circle with \"What do we appreciate about ourselves?\"and \"What do we like about working on our early sexual memories?\" To the secondquestion, I answered that \"I like that I get to feel close to people again.\"my peopleI cherish youI feel your painI cry with youI remember this one time at the age of seven or eight, feeling so terribly hurtby something one of my siblings said or did to me. It was one of those times when mybody could not hold in the pain of what felt like a wave of grief. This one time, thetears waited for me to find a safe place where I could be alone to cry. If I let it go withone of my siblings nearby, I knew I would be further harassed for showing my feelingsaround him. For whatever reason, he could not listen to me cry.So with all my strength, I held my pain in my throat and walked a safe distanceaway from my house to let the tears fall down my face and quietly sob so no one couldhear me. At that young age, I knew my body needed to release the pain with flowingtears and sounds from my broken heart. In this way, I survived. I doubt that mybrothers and sisters were ever allowed to cry at Residential School. I believe that theyand many other children had to cry alone. 134122 Residential Schools robbed me as a child. It robbed me of everything. I hadnobody to turn to, not my parents, not my sisters, no one. And witnessingabuse...and being abused myself ... after that, I was always full of hate andfear (Assembly of First Nations, 1994, 2).This makes me think of how many of my people have had to cry alone. If wecan't cry together, we end up having to isolate ourselves just to feel safe. I wonderwhy we have to go somewhere to cry by ourselves when we come from a heritage ofcustoms, rituals, ceremonies, and traditions that encourage healing, community, andwellness. This is talked about extensively in a report by the International Institute forSustainable Development (Clarkson, 1992):The whole system of Indigenous thought is a reflection of this balance of mind,body and spirit. The mechanisms by which this was delivered on a day to daybasis were geared to ensuring that the balance was maintained. The teachingsthat have been given to us are our guidelines and standards that are meant toensure that we continue to maintain the balance. The healing methods passedto us are the practical applications of the healing process to restore balancewhen we find ourselves moving in a different direction other than the oneprovided (p. 53).Words from my cousins still echo in my mind at times when I need to cry. Tohelp each other, or to show we cared but didn't know what to do with each other's pain,we would say, \"Don't cry, your tears will freeze and your eyelids will get frozentogether.\" Abandoned children, we huddled outside my house down the flats waitingfor a taxi cab to bring our parents back home from the bars in town.Harsher words were used to silence me as I got older. One very violent assaulton my small body when I was five left me deciding to never cry again. To cry meantfeeling the pain, feeling how hopeless and powerless I was. Who wants to feel likethat? I learned ways to keep myself numb. Alcohol became my escape from thedevastation, shock, shame and rage in my heart. I used it to forget what happened tome. I knew then, by age nine, that alcohol was helping everyone else forget whathappened to them, it kept them numb also. \"Many sexually abused children havedeveloped alcohol and/or drug dependencies which must be dealt with in addition to theproblems related to the sexual abuse\" (Martens, Daily, Hodgson, 1988).I will never forget one young boy who died at a young age of alcoholpoisoning.I looked into his eyes and saw what was happening to him. He was just likeme, trying to stay numb yet feeling very alone and terrified. I looked into the eyes ofeveryone around me and saw my people dying inside; I wondered why no one was 123135 helping us, why was the world letting this happen? I concluded that it must be becausewe were not important, I was not important.I decided that I would forget everything that happened to me and everythingthat I saw until I got big enough to stop it. My plan was to survive; then, when I gotbig, I would go around and look in all the people's windows to see that no child wasbeing raped. It was a good plan and it helped me to rest and play for awhile.I sought help for many years. Once, in Grade 4, I whispered into a teacher'sear, as loudly as I could manage without spilling my shame onto her, I thought. \"Couldyou take me home with you?\" She did not respond.Another time, I saw a psychiatrist when I was fourteen. It was set up for meto see him once a month during the time that I became suicidal. I met with him once.He, a white man with a starched shirt and tie, looked directly at me and through me, itseemed, as if he was looking for something, some clue as to what exactly was wrongwith me. This was unbearable, uncomfortable and humiliating. At the end of thesession, I was facing the wall with my back towards him. I was grateful that I neverhad to be alone with him again.I had come to fear men, to distrust them and feel inferior in their presence. Ihad worn the feelings of shame and inferiority for so long that I came to believe therewas something wrong with me. Sheehan (1992) talks about the origin of shame, acloak I had worn for many years.Feelings of shame stem from negative self-evaluations that undermine our self-confidence. Often, these negative self-evaluations are rooted in childhoodexperiences in which we were not nurtured as a valuable person and, thus, wefalsely concluded that we were worthless (p. 1).A Native Public Health Nurse, who had a good picture of what was happeningto me, did not send me away with pills, but listened and cared. She was the first personI told about the sexual abuse. I felt I could trust her; she was from my community andhad similar experiences. What made me decide to trust her was that she told me whathappened to her. She trusted me first. It was her caring and attention that got me outof my depression, and my alcoholism was arrested for a time. As a teenager, living inthe group home, I stayed sober, came home on time and went to school everyday, gotgood grades; a real \"goody-goody\" as I had come to be known by some of the non-Native students. What did they know?It has taken many years to get out of that isolation from people, thehopelessness about life, the feelings of utter powerlessness which are still the cold 13$124 winds that blow at my door. The depression was like the nightmares I had. I had thesame one for yearsI am laying across the train tracks, a train is coming, and I can'tget off the tracks.I always woke up sweating and terrified. Later on, when I gave upalcohol and began taking care of myself, it was only my arm on the train tracks; then, inthe last of those dreams, of actually being on the train instead of under it.The dreams I have indicate to me where I need to work on myself; they arethe memories my body has held for me until I can look at them and work on them.These memories have waited for the safety and support I need in my life to release thehurts I have endured:It was first through the sweatlodge (Brown, 1988, p. 46) that I was given thepermission I felt I needed to cry again. The elders said it is good to cry, \"it is healing.\"This was all I needed to hear to release a flood of tears. The two summers I spent witha group of Anishnabe were a gift that I will always remember. It was at a time when Icould not return home to my people, the ones that were closest to my heart; they werestill hurting each other and using alcohol as their answer. I could not go back there fora long time, the place where I had been victimized.Instead, I adopted a new family. Their acceptance, caring and respect broughttremendous healing to me. Their spirit of sharing contradicted the pattern of isolation,terror, and loneliness I had come to know and live by. In the sweatlodge, we sharedour stories, our pain, and we cried together (Clarkson et al., 1992). In honor of eachother, we cried with each other. I had never seen that anywhere else before in my life.Another place of real healing in my life was from the Big Book of AlcoholicsAnonymous (1986). In AA meetings, I found fellowship, and the sharing of stories andstruggles was therapeutic for me emotionally, mentally and spiritually (O'Reilly, 1997). Idiscovered the AA program through my cousin who had also struggled with alcoholism.Her sobriety made me feel hopeful about myself, though it took me two years toactually sober up.Without alcohol, I would experience severe panic attacks. I felt I could notbreathe when the sun was setting; I would have to be outside or near an open windowas the sky darkened. I could not see the beauty in the sunset. The sunset in mywindow brought fear, loneliness and dread for it reminded me that night was comingand with it danger to my very being. This was learned from my childhood and I had tounlearn it as an adult. Getting to meetings saved my life. Talking on the phone with 125 other AA members helped me to manage all the feelings that came up for me on a dailybasis.Getting sober and staying sober has meant having to feel again, having to behonest with myself, and being willing to make amends where I have wronged people.After eleven years of sobriety, I still have a few amends left to make. I believe that, ingood time, those opportunities will be presented to me; it is up to me to take a positivedirection in all of them. Getting sober has also meant my freedom. Today, I am free ofalcohol. There is no alcohol in my home today. My child has never seen me drinkalcohol; this is a miracle in my eyes.The third place of healing, that found it's way to me, was through drama. Ihad been recruited through my work to facilitate a group at \"Adults Molested asChildren.\" There, I got involved with the drama group. The group had already beenperforming for a year or so when I was added in as the \"distress recording,\" the voicewe survivors hear in our minds long after surviving the incidents of abuse. My voice, atthat time, was so soft and faint that, on stage, it was not loud enough to be heard. Thiswas my struggle in sticking with the play.With much encouragement from the group and persistent coaching from our\"director,\" my voice found its way out of me and with it came my power. Whattransformed me was being able to voice my pain out loud and, more than that, I wasable to go back and \"confront\" the abuser while the audience looked on as if comingback there with me.Wethered (1973) talks about the use of drama in therapy, which is what theplay was for metherapy and healing:In such portrayal, excess emotion may be drawn off in the actual playing, or,by being able to sink the personality in the part, a person may contact otherpeople or find a new freedom. Inner problems may be eased temporarily byabsorption in the drama, and so may perhaps be seen more objectively by theparticipant, relieved of the emotional pressure for the time being (p. 61).Out of this participation in a play about women who survived childhood sexualabuse came a spring of creativity. I discovered, within myself, the ability to write insuch a way that I could reach people, including my own siblings. One of my brotherstold me several times how deeply touched he was by one poem in particular which I hadwritten; this was very validating for me. The poem had helped him to think about hisown alcoholism and how it was affecting his family. Recovering my voice happened through poetry, which was another healingresult of my role in the play. Poetry therapy is talked about by Schattner and Courtney(1981) as the \"expression and release of emotion through poetry and other forms ofcreative writing in order to attain greater insight and understanding of the self\" (p. 222).The most recent place of healing for me and what I have come to use in mylife and in my work is Co-counselling or Re-evaluation Counselling (Jackins, 1994).Here, I have experienced the most profound and lasting changes in my life. It has beena very empowering tool for me as a Native woman. My thinking, feeling, doing hasshifted completely from being a victim to being in charge of my life and my home.What has held me to this process is the way it parallels Native thought and Nativeceremony. The policy of equal time-equal power, that no one person is more powerfulor more valuable than another person, has held true in all my experiences with Co-counselling. This one idea, and the consistent practice of it, has held the greatestcontradiction to the ways that I have been victimized.It has provided a place of safety to heal my old wounds by using the discharge,or releasing of emotions, as a process of healing. The theory and process of Co-counselling parallels very closely with Native thought regarding the perception of cryingas healing, and the belief in our inherent goodness as humans. What first attracted meto Co-counselling was the amazing variety of people coming together; people fromvarious cultural, religious, and economic backgrounds, working on their own liberationbut doing it together.It is by crying that I am able to heal from my past hurts. Not by crying alone,in isolation, but with others who are respectful of me and who give me their watchfulattention. Today, my co-counsellors and I take turns listening to each other releasingour pain. When we come together, it is with deep caring and appreciation for eachother's brilliance, goodness and as celebration of our survival.As a counsellor, I have worked with people who also survived by learning notto cry. Their voices are flat, lifeless, without expression, while they tell of the horrificthings that happened to them. It may take them a long time to get to the tears.Sometimes, they are ready to cry when I meet them for the first time; they are merelywaiting for the right opportunity, a listener who will actually listen to them cry.Sometimes, then, when I use the words that reflect the truth about them, it only takes afew words, \"You are a good person, you have always been a good person,\" for theirtears to begin flowing. 1213 9 In this way, I continue to heal from my past; it is ongoing and a process thatwill be a part of my life as a counsellor and as a person. My personal search for helpand healing has brought me to want to be a listener for others. Now, I also want toknow how other Native adults survived their childhood trauma what was their journeylike? Where did they go for help? What was useful to them and what was not useful?Counselling and Healing: Two RoadsSeveral key experiences as a student, sojourner, and counsellor have forcedme to look at the differences that exist between two worlds the Western andIndigenous ways of counselling and healing. In developing my skills as a counsellor,and as a Native counsellor, I have been evaluating what is out there, in this urbansetting, that Native people can use to heal themselves.During my six-week Counselling practicum, I had the opportunity to observeand work with the adolescents who had been placed in a psychiatric hospital. The wardwas named Behavior Therapy. What I notice was that, at any given time, half or moreof the patients were of Native heritage. What I also noticed, and became concernedwith, was the heavy and consistent reliance on medication, drugs, for the purposes ofalleviating or suppressing the symptoms that the youth presented. At the treatmentteam meetings, the very first word uttered by the officiating psychiatrist as to whatcould be done to 'help' the youth was the amount, in milligrams, of a particular drug,and whether to increase or decrease it according to the severity of symptoms or side-effects of medication being presented by that child.The labels that were put on them, such as \"schizophrenia,\" seemed to sumthem up into a category from which they were never expected to move, and so theiruniqueness as a person became submerged within a labelling of illness to the doctors,nurses, social worker, psychologist, and occupational therapist. The hope for them tomove through their struggles seemed non-existent; it was not something held out forthem by the staff. There seemed to be an unspoken resignation on the ward that saidto the patients and their parents: \"Don't hope to heal from schizophrenia, just find waysto manage it for the rest of your life.\"The place for communication or expression was a therapy group called\"express yourself,\" where it was hoped the youth would talk about their worries and getclarification and support from each other. When any of them tried to express theirfeelings, particularly the suppressed anger, they were removed from the group. Therewas no method for allowing one to express his/her emotions in a safe and thoughtful 128140 way. They were limited to very narrow ways of expressing themselves in the group,where their behavior came under attack and they were put in a time-out chair.If their\"inappropriate\" or undesirable behavior progressed or continued, they were locked in aseclusion room while they expressed their anger with no one close by to listen to them.This seemed unfair and inhumane to me; at least, it seemed an ineffective wayof healing, as I understand healing. It seemed unfair to provide a place where thepatients are told they can express themselves, yet are not told exactly what is allowedor not allowed at the start. They could be told that this is a place where you can talkabout your feelings, but if you need to show your feelings, you can get a session withyour nurse or worker. When they did attempt to show themselves, in the only waysthey knew how, their ways were considered inappropriate by the behaviorist approachtherapist, and they were reprimanded and subdued even further, and controlled by theuse of drugs and isolation. There is a difference between saying how you feel andactually releasing the rage.This experience reminded me of a friend I came to know who was a patient inthe adult psychiatric ward and who had been there for many years. As a volunteer, Iwould visit with her or take her out for a drive if she wanted. One day, I went to seeher and she asked if we could go outside to the skating rink; she wanted to be able tocry, and told me if she got upset on the ward, it would mean isolation and medication.She wanted freedom to cry about something that was distressful to her and to havesomeone listen to her cry.This Western way of \"being helped\" was completely opposite to what Iparticipated in at a Native workshop organized by Four Worlds Development (Bopp &Bopp, 1997) where there were a variety of counselling and healing tools offered to theparticipants. I attended one session where people lined up into the night to do \"angerwork.\" Because I was there as a support to the facilitator and was familiar andcomfortable with this kind of counselling, I was one of the counsellors that night. Thetwo of us worked into the late hours listening to people's rage.The participants wanted the freedom to scream and cry and sob as loud asthey could with caring attention. This involved laying on the floor on a mat, which wasactually all our jackets laid out for them, while being held down by six to eight people asa way of providing something to push on with their whole body. Often, when we have alot of anger in us, we try not to let it out for the fear of hurting someone or ourselves.This method offered the safety people needed to really rage and grieve. 129141 In this way, they got to go back and fight for themselves at the time and placewhere they gave up fighting, where they lost their power. Every one of them went backto when they were sexually abused. They each used this opportunity to go back andrescue their child within (Whitfield, 1987). It was evident that this experience wasuseful to them as they finished their sessions and encouraged others to try it.To be able to scream and cry with safety for however long they needed just toget the feelings of rage, hopelessness, and powerlessness out, with one main listenergiving you their complete respect and attention was empowering to all of us that night.Others who waited for their turn stayed together, holding each other, listening to therage pour out of people with words, screams and crying. Everyone was thoughtful ofeach other, taking care of each other, all recognizing the importance of the work beingdone by each person and all validating the innocence and goodness of each one. Thiswent on late into the night and again the next day.When people were through with their sessions, they were welcomed back intothe present with hugs, smiles and encouragement. They were able to go back to theplace where they had been victimized and with the support of others and good attentionfrom the counsellors, they fought for themselves, they fought for their power. For manyof them, it was the beginning of their walk into freedom from their past hurts; forothers, it was another milestone on their long journey of healing.These experiences made me think of how different Western mental healthoften is from Indigenous healing. Though there are many therapies in Westerncounselling, it should be noted that the mental health services that most people haveaccess to is dominated by a pharmaceutical treatment. 'The bureaucratic stylepredominates in mental hospitals, as well as in prisons, schools, and community mentalhealth centers, where the aim is to isolate deviants and compel them to behaveproperly\" (Jaffe, 1975, p. 48).There are many differences that exist today in the Western and Indigenoushealing practices. This comparison began for me when I met the Native children on thepsychiatric ward and wondered if any of them had ever had the opportunity to go to asweatlodge ceremony. When I asked the psychiatrist, he said they tried staying intouch with an elder years ago, but he did not know what was going on with that anylonger. Instantly, I was concerned with this non-Aboriginal staff not knowing very muchabout Native culture.I wondered how they could know, or presume to know, what wasuseful for the Native patients on the ward. 142'130 I also observed the assessment process in the child and adolescent ward; itconsisted of a team of professionals a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker,teacher, occupational therapist, and a psychiatric nurse who all looked at the child'sbehavior and symptoms. Each worked in isolation in their testing of the patients,typically along the lines of behavior, affect, sensation, imagery, cognition, interpersonalrelationships and drugs/biology as has been outlined in Lazarus' BASIC I.D. (Corey,1996, p. 229). The team would come together with their separate diagnoses for teamassessment meetings and a plan was put together for the treatment of the individualchildren.The view of the patient was divided up into pieces of behavior, assessed inisolation by the practitioners, then put together again like a puzzle. Diagnosis tookplace for the first week that the child was in the hospital. For the time being, most ofthe patients' symptoms were treated with medication. Isolation was used to manage orcorrect his/her negative behavior. The actual counselling or therapy took place whilethe child was on the medication. I asked myselfhow can the child get to his/herfeelings while sedated? The relationship of trust between patient and doctor is hinderedby the goal of controlling and shaping behavior. This puts up a barrier to the process ofreleasing emotions with \"care and respect\" for the individual's struggle. In this sense,the patient is not honored, but only conditioned.I knew that these children were really good people who had been hurt in someway. I had learned from Native elders that we are all born into the world as goodpeople (Hart, 1997). As humans, we are born in harmony with the universe. It is whathappens to us in life that threatens this balance.Because of this, I was saddened that the hospital had not found a morehealing way, a more human way, of responding to the children, especially the Nativechildren. The focus was on correcting behavior, rather than restoring inner balance andempowerment. I believed, at that point, that greater harm was being done to theseyoung people. I could not perceive their treatment as therapeutic, as it did not actuallyliberate them the way the sweatlodge ceremonies had helped me.As a result, I became more interested in what the child was actually trying tosay to the adults in their environment parents, teachers, counsellors, and doctors. Iwanted to know more about their original hurts, their early trauma, and whether theyhad ever been given the opportunity to give it a voice in order to release it, or had they 1311 4 3 always been medicated and forced to 'control' or suppress their thoughts, feelings, andbehaviors.What I often see is that most Native people who relocate to urban centres turnto Western counselling or self-help programs initially and use the opportunity to telltheir story a few times over. After a while, they find they want more from counselling,possibly something more spiritual, a connection to other humans and maybe to theirown people if they are seeing a non-Native counsellor, which is often the case. This iswhen they return to their own traditional teachings and ceremonies reclaiming whatthey had lost in their assimilation in Residential Schools and, then, depending on theirexperience of re-discovery, they will either stay with it or go away to find other ways ofhealing. Some of them turn to Christian beliefs and the church, or some will use amixture of all three ways as a means of building support for themselves in their healingfrom childhood trauma.Further research will help us to identify methods of healing and counsellingthat are appropriate for Aboriginal communities.An Overview of Research on Counselling and HealingBecause of my exposure to the mental health system, as a Native womancounsellor, my interest in the research of healing journeys is based upon the recognitionof the need for effective healing strategies for Native people. My concern is that Nativeclients may not be receiving the healing that is appropriate for them, culturally andspiritually, in the mainstream mental health services. \"This concern warrants anexamination of the effectiveness of the Western mental health services\" (York, 1990 ascited in McCormick, 1995). Therefore, this literature search will be focused upon acritique of current Western mental health processes in the light of Aboriginal culturalrealities.HealingClarkson et al. (1992), in a report of the International Institute for SustainableDevelopment, offer a simple, yet conclusive, definition of healing:Their minds must be healed from the ravages of centuries of oppression. Theirbodies must be reclaimed from alcohol and abuse, both sexual and physical.Their spirits must be reclaimed, the spirit of their ancestors not the spirit ofChristianity or any other doctrine.\" Adding to that, an alternative to thepresent Western mental health services. \"We have found wherepsychoanalysis, conventional therapy, and other means of dealing with peoples'problems, have failed, there is one way that has consistently given results andthat has changed peoples' lives profoundly, giving them a renewed sense ofself, a stronger foundation to face the world and a vision for the future. This way entails the reclamation of their understanding of themselves as Indigenouspeople and their role on this planet (p. 47).The process of healing as outlined by Clarkson et al. (1992) begins with anunderstanding of the colonial relationship and the impact it has had on Indigenouspeople. This process is described as the \"historical reconstruction from an Indigenousperspective.\" Adding that \"we must do this because the mainstream and its methodshave failed us consistently in all aspects of our lives\" (p. 46).The report also stated strongly and clearly that \"the healing process forIndigenous people must be facilitated by Indigenous people using the healing methodsthat are specific to their culture\"(p. 47).Too often, non-Indigenous groups are funded to deliver a range of socialsupport services to Indigenous people on the basis that they are adisadvantaged group. Not only does this result in culturally inappropriateservices, but the underlying dependency dynamic shaping the relationshipbetween Indigenous peoples and the dominant society is not altered.Notwithstanding that many non-Indigenous people benefit from Indigenouspoverty and oppression, and that significant economic benefits would berealized through Indigenous control of the social service delivery system,appreciable change will not occur until Indigenous peoples are personallyresponsible for, and in control of, their own healing (p. 76).Finally, the report rejects the \"client\" relationship in helping services,suggesting that it must be eliminated if real healing is to occur:The professionalization of helping services is a barrier to healing because therelationship is fundamentally unequal. Often, people who need assistancedealing with life stresses are not prepared to use existing services because thestructure of services requires them to adopt a subordinate position relative tothe helper. Real healing occurs in an environment of equality where, no matterhow serious someone's problem, he/she sal has something to offer someoneelse. Equality in helping relationships means recognizing that no-one iswithout life stresses and no-one is without personal resources that are valuableto others. Additionally, the professionalization of Indigenous social servicesmitigates against a role for traditional methods and healers, since such servicestend to adopt conventional mainstream practices (p. 76).Another Aboriginal definition of healing and healthy communities, found in onestudy by Buller (1994), emphasizes \"people getting involved in the community; trust,caring sharing; positive parenting, good teachings; openness, communication; ashamed; and taking responsibility, having clear expectations.\" The studyoutlines three aspects of the healing process: \"moving from within,\" it starts with theindividual and expands into the family and finally to the community; \"balance andwholeness, mind, body, soul connection, all are equal; \"and \"moving from programs to 133 process, \"noting that \"programs imported from outside the community, and not at thevery least adapted to the realities of that community, were at risk of failing.\" This thirdaspect suggested strongly that \"the most effective approach of all is one of communitydevelopment from within.\"One chapter is devoted to community healing, including victims and offenders.The recognition that justice should include healing points out a valid viewpoint ofcommunity restoration versus the mainstream focus of punishment and \"correction.\"One participant speaks to this very poignantly:Victims and offenders should definitely be brought into the healing process. Iam a victim and an offender and, as a youth, it is kinda scary to have to talkabout what happened to me as a child. I was afraid to tell because I did notwant them (the authorities) to hurt my mommy. As I got older, I began tohurt other people like she did me, and recently I realized what I was doing (p.45).Another participant agrees with this viewpoint and talks about theineffectiveness of prisons that do not provide healing for offenders.When I was in jail and came out, it was OK for a few minutes; things seemednormal, but then it passed and I felt out of it, not a part of it. So, I turnedback to drinking. One of the things I didn't deal with was my anger, and nowas I go through this program, I am able to learn and to practice new ways toexpress it (p. 47).McCormick (1995) outlines \"healing outcomes\" in his study \"The Facilitation ofHealing for the First Nations People of British Columbia.\" In it, emphasis is placed on\"empowerment, cleansing, balance, discipline and belonging\"as an effective healingprogram. Analyzed narrative accounts revealed five main themes:A broad spectrum of healing resources are available to First Nations people;First Nations people have a different way of seeing the world that has to beunderstood before effective counselling services can be provided; First Nationspeople expect that whatever is healing should help them to attain and/ormaintain balance; self-transcendence followed by connectedness is a commonroute to healing for First Nations people; and First Nations people are seen toact as agents of their own healing (p. 251).One category of healing that stands out in a unique way is cleansingphysically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Cleansing refers to eliminating orgetting rid of bad energy, spirits, or emotions and can include outcomes such aselimination, purging, relieving pressure, and releasing emotions. It is the expression ofemotion such as pain, anger, or fear that often leads to cleansing. The study states that -the belief in the healing power of cleansing is prevalent in First Nations people and notso prominent'in Western approaches to healing. Because much of the practice of 146134 cleansing is expressed in a symbolic way, it may not be visible or understood by non-Native people.Another healing outcome is the participation in ceremony such as thesweatlodge ritual which is considered a place of cleansing or rebirthing. Other healingoutcomes were listed as empowerment, establishing social connection, establishing aspiritual connection, establishing a connection with nature, anchoring oneself intradition, exercise, involvement in challenging activities, expressing oneself, obtaininghelp/support from others, self care, helping others, gaining an understanding of theproblem, and learning from a role model.CounsellingWetsit (1999) writes, \"counselling had its origin in education and normativedevelopmental work with people, whereas psychology and psychiatry are oriented moretoward the diagnosis and treatment of pathology.\" In regards to American Indiancultures, she states:Counselling has always played an important role. For example, traditionalNative healers have strived to meet the counselling needs of the communityand individual. These traditional activities may not be recognized by EuropeanAmerican observers as counselling due to differences in approach and process;yet, the intent of providing help to individuals, families, or groups is the same.Carolyn Attneave points out that, even today, the presence and responsibilitiesof traditional healers remain hidden to non-Native counsellors. She attributesthis hidden existence to the long history of persecution and superstition ofEuropean American society. However, counselling persists within Nativecultures (p. 180).About cross-cultural counselling, she recognizes that cultural awareness hasincreased by professionals since the 1970s, including the realization that expectationsfor counsellor and client roles have been influenced almost exclusively by WesternEuropean models and worldviews.While these models have proven effective in working with members ofEuropean American society, they have been less effective with otherethnicities. Counsellors need to remember that American Indians and otherethnic minorities are socialized to interpret their experiences in the world muchdifferently than the majority culture (p. 183).HopeFournier and Crey (1997) talk about the abduction of First nations children andthe restoration of Aboriginal communities:Hodgson says the success of the Native sobriety movement that, since 1969,has swept through North American reserves and urban communities \"has beentremendously empowering. Its brought us out of our midnight of residential 135147 schools, alcoholism, family breakdown, and sexual abuse, and into thedaylight.\" The Carrier woman is convinced the Aboriginal community has takenthe crucial first steps toward vanquishing sexual abuse. \"For years, we tried todose up and hide this issue; now, we are choosing the opposite road, to openit up and develop treatment approaches. We can become leaders in thetreatment of sexual abuse,\" says Hodgson, \"just as we did in achievingsobriety, against what people said were incredible odds\" (p. 137).From this brief look at the literature on Native healing and counselling, it canbe said that there is hope for Native people. There is hope that we can heal ourselvesand we can end the alcoholism, violence, and abuse in our communities, in our lives,and in our families. We do not have to rely on the Western approaches or models forour wellness. In fact, it can be said that we have much to offer Western society and theworld.Giokas' (1992) article in the report of the National Round Table on AboriginalJustice Issues (1993) rings out what is cause for celebration:A global human rights revolution is going on that has assisted Aboriginalpeoples worldwide in their drive for new power sharing arrangements in thestates in which they are found. Since 1982, and the renewed emphasis onrights under the Constitution, it seems inevitable that a new relationship basedon new political and constitutional rules that will recognize the right ofAboriginal peoples in Canada to self-government is just around the corner (p.189).This change will have tremendous impact on the way healing/counselling is totake shape in the new millennium, possibly for all peoples, but certainly for Nativepeople. Therefore, it is critical that we begin to understand what Native people needand want in mental health services and in their re-introduction to the traditionalIndigenous ways of healing.According to Buller (1994), Aboriginal people do not want \"piece-mealprograms, but rather a process for holistic development; the project also served toreinforce that Aboriginal communities are excited by the opportunity and are willing toshare their expertise and knowledge about healing as it relates to the development ofhealthy communities across Canada. Although there may be cultural differences, thesedifferences need not become barriers to communication between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities or the sharing of expertise across cultural lines\" (p. 85).In fact, further research dissemination of Aboriginal healing and counsellingapproaches will likely be richly helpful for all cultural groups. There appears to bespecial value in making a distinction between \"talking about\" a problem versus actuallyreleasing the pain toward healing.,148136 ReferencesAlcoholics Anonymous. (1986).

Healing the Child Within. Deerfield Beach, FL: HealthCommunications, Inc. 1 50138 A Sense of Place: Aboriginal Researchas Ritual Practice Carolyn Kenny Today, I understand that education is one key in a very small set of keys whichwill unlock the doors of possibility and choice for our people, for our children. I couldhave made this statement yesterday, or the day before, or last year, or the year before,or many years before. But, today, I have a new and deeper feeling about the conceptof education and what it can mean for us. This new feeling is the result of my reflectionon my research over the last two years in some of our Aboriginal communities.Knowledge is one of the core values for us. And sometimes, this translatesinto education in the modern world. My own mother, a Choctaw, emphasized theimportance of education. From an early age, I heard the word 'education.' She alwayssaid, \"Education is one thing that no one can take away from you. Get as much as youcan.\" And I did.I went all the way. I got a Ph.D.Now, I work for a large university. Part of my work is research in ourAboriginal communities. As a Native researcher, I've had many conversations withcolleagues about doing research. I've also had my own experiences doing research inour Aboriginal communities and, in conjunction with this research, have heard a lot ofstories about education and research. In this article, I want to explore some of thedilemmas of doing Aboriginal research and offer some ideas and approaches which havehelped me to diminish conflicts in my own work.In our Native world, education is valued. But education, for some, canrepresent the history of colonization and the association of education with colonizinginstitutions. Education can be perceived and felt as representing government, church,institutions which are not grounded in Native values. Hegemony is a powerful concept.And it's true. The academie is full of hegemony. By hegemony, I mean that thesystems, such as the academie and all it represents, are embedded with the values and 1391 51 beliefs of the people who created them. And these people were not Native. Therefore,the universities were not created on a foundation of Aboriginal values, not at all.There is a difference between education and knowledge. And though manyelders and leaders, like my mother, emphasize the importance of education, it is oftenperceived as a way to get ahead in the modern world, and even a way to get ahead inthe \"white\" world. The status of the degree counts. And the knowledge counts, too.But, often, getting an education is perceived as a betrayal.Those of us who move ahead into the educational and academic fields are onthe horns of a dilemma. We want to grow, to know, to share our learning in ourcommunities, to develop ourselves in the modern world. Yet, far too often, getting theeducation and the degrees puts us in a position of isolation and alienation among ourown people.For Native men and women who go on to higher education, and attempt tobring the methods they learn in the university back into our communities, there areoften painful encounters associated with this dilemma. Many have left theircommunities with the idea of learning about the modern ways in the city, at theuniversity, and return to their communities with the gifts of knowledge from theacademie, only to be shunned by the leadership as \"outsiders\" among their own people.This can be devastating when one has taken a basic position of \"caring\" of improvingoneself with the hopes of sharing our new knowledge and skills with folks back home.Another reason that Aboriginal research is tough is the fight with the universityitself. The \"publish or perish\" principle is very different from the guidelines of the RoyalCommission on Aboriginal Peoples, which state that the primary purpose of the researchmust be the benefit of the research to the people being studied. This discrepancy inapproaches puts the Aboriginal researcher in the position of trying to negotiate with theuniversity over things such as partnership agreements, consent forms, copyrightpolicies. The university is in a position of privilege and, most often, claims the territoryof the findings on behalf of scholarly publications such as texts and journals, which areinaccessible to the people who are being studied. In order to secure a place in theacademie, Aboriginal scholars need to obtain tenure. And tenure is contingent upon theproduction of texts for just such publications.Funding agencies also can become a deterrent to good Aboriginal research.The research questions, research methodologies, and methods of documentation aresometimes not in accord with Aboriginal needs, values or beliefs. And the requirements of the funders sometimes do not give Aboriginal researchers the freedom to act on whatthey perceive to be the needs of the communities in a way which reflects our worldview. The agenda of the funder drives the way the research is done and, subsequently,the results of studies. Often funders do not offer Aboriginal researchers an opportunityto exercise their creativity. Creativity is an important aspect of good Aboriginalresearch.For me, the most difficult aspect of Aboriginal research is the weight of thehistory of practices of previous researchers. There are issues of appropriation,misrepresentation, and even abuse. When Aboriginal scholars enter communities to doresearch, they bear the weight of this unfortunate history. People have a hard timebelieving, even under the best of circumstances, that it could be different. Often,Aboriginal researchers are perceived as guilty until proven innocent. Often, they mustsit patiently and listen to the concerns, biases and even prejudice toward research andeducation itself, before work can begin. And, sometimes, it doesn't begin. Sometimes,leaders in the communities have put a moratorium on the conducting of any research atall. There is a devastating irony in this. In the final analysis, lack of research in ourcommunities, or resistance to research, only diminishes our capacity to acquire fundingfor programs, to improve the quality of our lives, and to begin to establish our ownagenda and procedures in the research.When we manage to accomplish what we feel is good Aboriginal research,there's nothing like it. We soar. And though I have started this article keeping thedilemmas in mind, I have also had many productive and enriching experiences doingAboriginal research in the last two years. The highlights of these research experienceshave been my relationships with community liaisons, making new friends across thecountry, being privileged to listen and be a witness to the stories of our people, andexperiencing the gratification of successful work which can help to make a difference inour communities. My research has been to conduct individual and group interviews.And I feel the importance of sitting quietly and listening. I also value the skills I havedeveloped as an interviewer, the challenge of formulating the right questions which godeeper and deeper into knowing. And I am very grateful for these experiences.In one project, \"North American Indian, Metis and Inuit Women Speak AboutCulture, Education and Work,\" I served as the project manager. Our team of threeresearchers conducted individual and group interviews at eight sites across Canada. Wewanted to learn about barriers, which kept Aboriginal women from realizing their hopes and dreams for education and work. We often heard stories about women who felt theyhad to sacrifice their education in order to keep their culture. It was very sad that theycould not have both.My purpose in writing this paper is to share some ideas about how we mightapproach Aboriginal research in a way which reflects our cultural values and practices.A Sense of Place\"Know who you are.\" We often hear this phrase from our elders. Our strengthis in a solid belief in our identity and, therefore, a confidence to move ahead with a surestep. Knowing who you are means knowing where you come from and knowing whoyour people are.Over the last thirty years, my journey in the academie has been a burningdesire to understand. I want to understand the issues associated with my bi-culturalidentity. My mother is Native and my father is Ukranian. As a child, I often spent agreat deal of time in the forest staying very close to pine needles and trickling brooks. Icomposed songs and listened to a lot of birds. Beauty was very important to me.Staying close to Mother Earth with my senses was very important to me. Subsequently,I became a music and creative arts therapist. One of the areas of my study has beenaesthetics.I want to know about the importance of beauty and arts expression. Howdo our experiences in the arts help us to survive and thrive? One of my researchprojects has been to study the role of the arts in the revitalization of Aboriginalsocieties.I know that the arts can offer opportunities for growth and change on anexperiential level because, after thirty years, I have had many experiences, personallyand professionally, with the arts, enough to know deep in my heart about theirimportance. However, that isn't enough. In order to share with others, I need todevelop concepts, ideas, language. I need to be involved in discursive practices withresearch participants, colleagues and friends.As Aboriginal scholars move into higher education and assume positions in theacademie, how do we integrate the academie into our identity, into \"who we are?\" Howdo we walk with a sure foot in the halls of the university? Though I really like the ideaof the university, the possibilities which open up when we are associated with theuniversities, I struggle to stay whole, to keep my identity intact, to feel that I \"belong.\"The fundamental values of the university seem so different than mine, most of the timeboth my beliefs as a Native person, and as an individual. 1 54142 I believe that our search for a \"sense of place\" is fundamental to ourexperience as human beings. And as Aboriginal people, we rely on a sense of place, ourconnection to the land to know home, to belong. For the Aboriginal scholar andresearcher, finding this sense of place is not easy. But I do want to tell you about a daywhen I had that feeling.I found my sense of place for a short time. All my worldscame together at the same time.One day, I had completed my draft of our report, \"North American Indian,Metis and Inuit Women Speak about Culture, Education and Work.\" As the projectmanager, I had put together the draft report and had written many of the chapters.Often, I got up at 2:30 in the morning to begin my work, when things were quiet and Iwas clear-headed.On this day, I was so happy to be putting the work in the mail to send it tothe participants for their feedback. I felt that I had done a good job. And, in my heart,I felt that I belonged. I was happy to be driving to the university that day. The usualinternal and external conflicts which permeate my days on campus, being the onlytenure-track Aboriginal scholar in a major university, disappeared. I had a feeling ofcontentment. As a worker, I was fulfilled. Having a position at the university had givenme an opportunity to \"be a researcher,\" and working in Aboriginal communities acrossthe nation had given me an opportunity to feel that I could be with other Aboriginalpeople and actually make some kind of contribution which would help to improve ourlives as Aboriginal peoples.For awhile, I felt whole, living in all my worlds together, not split off orfragmented. It all made sense because I had a sense of place. I could belong indifferent worlds at the same time, and I had been able to live in these different worldswithout having to compromise either one.On this day, I was happy to be going to my place of work. I tried to driveslowly, but my imagination soared. I could see myself walking down the halls of myuniversity with sure and solid feet. I knew it would be a good day because I knew Ibelonged. The university was my place. But, also, the Aboriginal communities were myplace.I could retain my identity and still work in an institution, which seems too aliento me so much of the time.Oh, you know, we manage. I know I struggle. In fact, most often, I see theuniversity and the research process as a site of struggle. How do we maintain and evennurture a sense of place, a feeling of belonging on a battleground? As Aboriginal 143155 scholars, we can put on the face, the dress. We can quickly learn the code of conductof a university professor and researcher. But only on this day did I realize how much Igive up on these other days, when I am a shadow of who I could be. What would it belike to have everyday a day like this? What would it be like to be able to walk downthose halls everyday and feel that sense of place, feel that I really belonged here in theuniversity? Well, that's a little extreme. But, it is an important question. What couldwe accomplish if we felt, more often, the wholeness of ourselves without having tomake those difficult choices, or learn those foreign ways of behaviour? Then, ourcreativity and our productivity could really soar.Nevertheless, I am grateful for those moments of wholeness. I'm trying tokeep the image, the feeling of walking down those halls on that day, alive and wellwithin me.Aboriginal ResearchIn contemporary times, there is an oppressive essentialism, which attempts tostandardize our lives for the sake of efficiency. As our worlds become more and morecomplex, this attitude of fundamentalism grows. Complexity is too tough. Perhaps themost offensive manifestation of this attitude in our society shows up when Aboriginalpeoples are treated as \"special interest groups.\" The greatest philosophers from anyculture tell us that, yes, there are certainly human essentials things we have incommon across cultures, across lands. But in the final analysis, the things we have incommon compose a small list. It is through our differences that we grow and change.Aboriginal peoples have something unique to contribute. There is something essentially\"different\" about usdifferent from peoples who originate in Western Europe. Thereare also many differences between our own peoples. We are not all the same.Yet, when we use a term like \"Aboriginal research,\" we have to define it, tofind out what it means within the context of our work. \"Aboriginal\" does describe aunique approach to research.What is Aboriginal research anyway? Is it the study of Aboriginal peoples byNative and non-Native scholars? Is it Aboriginal peoples studying Aboriginal peoples?Is it any research done by an Aboriginal person?For me, Aboriginal research is research which reflects the values and beliefs ofour peoples. Hopefully, when Aboriginal researchers do research, they will keep theirthinking broad in terms of methods and approaches, and will, at the same time, be able15 104 to construct and conduct their research in a way which is in-accordance with theirworldviews.I think of my research in music therapy as Aboriginal research, not so muchbecause I am an Aboriginal person, but because the methods I used, the way Iconducted my research, the theory I have constructed, all reflect my Native woridview,the one given to me by my mother.If I see non-Aboriginal people conducting their research in a way whichembodies the core values and beliefs which I have come to know as \"Aboriginal,\" theones which my mother taught me or the ones which I have learned from others Irespect, they, too, are doing Aboriginal research, in a sense. This attitude might notconform to the principles of identity politics. And I don't really understand it myself.But, I feel it. Maybe the non-Aboriginal person has been influenced in some way byAboriginal colleagues. Maybe they, too, come from a culture which has similar values toours. Or maybe they have landed on this approach to research through their own studyor through their intuitive sensibilities. No matter how they discovered it, I wouldrecognize it as Aboriginal research and I would feel \"related\" to this person, as acolleague, as a human being.Ritual PracticeIn our traditional societies, ritual was the functional representation of myth.And still today, in many tribal societies, which have had little contact, this closerelationship between ritual and myth remains. Myths are sacred stories, exemplarystories which guide our path, our growth. Rituals are the spaces in which myths areexpressed. Ritual spaces are safe and secure, constant enough to hold conflict anddissonance.Through the enactment of rituals, we have been able to keep our sacredstories, to keep remembering \"who we are.\" Aboriginal researchers are part of thesestories too. We have many stories, even if our own people have been almost destroyed,even if we don't know our Aboriginal languages, even if we sometimes feel lost. Thesacred stories are still part of our collective memory. Maybe we have a kind of amnesiafrom time to time. How can we access this collective memory and allow it to inform thediverse aspects of our lives, including the research process?Ritual practice implies a kind of \"right form,\" a proper way to do things. Ritualsare repeatable forms which make space for innovation. Rituals were also used to keepthings in order and provide safety for the people. When things are repeated over and 1451 over again, especially in our tribal rituals which follow the patterns of Mother Earth, wecome to understand that things are in order, even though they sometimes seem chaoticand we sometimes do not understand. When we have a sense of order and coherence,we feel safe and we can consider \"change.\"Let's consider applying the concept of ritual to our research practice. We havea set of procedures for research and we develop our skills. We use these skills over andover. If we develop mastery over the procedures, we are able to help with positivechanges in our communities. Through practice, we make them our own. They becomea part of our identity and are influenced by the other aspects of our collective andindividual identities.There are stages in a ritual practice. The first stage is preparation. Certainly,\"knowing who I am\" is the first part of my preparation. This means knowing where Icome from, appreciating all of my ancestors, and knowing my strengths and limitationsas a person. For the Aboriginal scholar, we might think of the many years we havespent in the university getting our education as a preparation. The preparation is alsothe wisdom handed down to us from elders and family members about the good way todo things. In a research study, we prepare ourselves through considering the bestapproach to our research. Cleansing is also part of preparation. When sweat lodges areavailable, some researchers are able to participate in the cleansing and purificationavailable in the lodge. I burn sweatgrass and sage. I also do a type of meditation,attempting to purge any preconceived notions I have about the various elements of myresearch. In phenomenological research, I need to have \"suspended judgement.\" AndI do a lot of phenomenological research, looking at the direct experience of myparticipants.The next stage of ritual practice is engagement or enactment. If I have done agood preparation, my focus is clear. My consciousness is able to bear witness to theexperience of my participants, to learn from them, to accurately record their stories, tohonour them. With each interview, I become better at being related to my interviewee.This is an inter-subjective space in the research process. I attempt to identify with myparticipants.I consume their stories wholeheartedly with a good listening ear, withempathy, with as much understanding as I am able. If I have fully integrated myidentity as a scholar, as a good researcher, I can participate in their stories and, at thesame time, begin to envision the \"innovative spaces\" which are possible worlds. Theseinnovative spaces are sensed first in the interviews themselves. But they come into my 153146 imagination as specific solutions in the analyzing of my data. I discern themes. I donot \"over interpret\" the data, as has been the case in much previous research in ourcommunities. I am not the center of the research. The participants are the center.And their words, their stories, must remain central to the research telling, the researchfindings. In this way, the power remains with the people and it can grow. When myfindings are published and they see their own words more than mine, they feel powerfuland they feel in control of their spaces, their lives.My skill as a researcher is apparent in my ability to express and suggestinnovation and change from the collection of stories and words. Because of the volumeof data, I must fly high to see the big picture. If I have done my research in a goodway, I can see very clearly. When I teach research methods to my students at theuniversity, I use Raven to help me describe the research process and the researchexperience. Raven flies. He surveys the land. He watches all of the berries. If he isusing all of his ravenly skills, he is discerning. He knows which berries to pick and heknows how to organize them and categorize them into the right baskets. When I studytranscripts of interviews, I feel a bit like Raven might feel. I wait for the words of theparticipants to jump out to me from the page. I survey the land over and over again. Iread the transcripts many times until I have a referential totality, a sense of the wholeset of transcripts, all of the stories and words of the participants.Another stage of ritual practice is validation. Has the enactment beenrecognized and appreciated by others? Validation occurs through the feedback ofadvisors and participants. Do they recognize the report I've created? Have I succeededin honouring their experiences, describing their situations, reporting their words? Dcthey have a good feeling from reading my report? Do they feel seen and heard in agood way? Do they agree with the conclusions I've drawn? Do they think this work canbe used to benefit their communities and themselves as individuals?My advisors, who are usually elders, also give me feedback about how I haveperformed as an individual. Have I used all of the talents and skills the Creator hasgiven me? Have I grown through this experience? They help me to check my path, tolearn from my experience so that I can keep progressing, keep learning.The last stage of the ritual practice is transformation and renewal. If theresearch findings are used wisely, positive change will come to the participants. Those\"innovative spaces\" will be explored. Change will occur and renewal will come. In myresearch, I listen to stories. Stories are not static. They are dynamic. Each time a 147159 story is told, there are changes in the body of the story. A story is told in a differentway depending on who the listener is. Stories change over time based on the stages ofdevelopment of the people telling the story. As they grow, they see things differently.Each time a story is told, there is new hope for positive change for our people. In this\"newness,\" we can find \"renewal.\" And we need it. We need it for ourselves and forour children.ConclusionToday, I understand that education is one key in a very small set of keys whichwill unlock the doors of possibility and choice for our people, for our children. Andtoday is a new day. After reflecting on my Aboriginal research, I have deepened, onceagain, my understanding about the importance of this key.Aboriginal research is an opportunity for us to create innovation and change forour people. If we develop an approach to research which is unique and reflects ourvalues and beliefs, we will be reflecting the spirit of our ancestors, the spirit of ourpeople who are alive today, and the spirit of our Aboriginal children who are yet to beborn.Through coming to the academie, we have created the opportunity foruniversities to be sites of struggle. I struggle.I struggle everyday to feel that I belong.But we can belong, and we must belong. The identity of an Aboriginal universityprofessor who conducts research can, in itself, be perceived as an innovative space, andone which can be integrated and incorporated into our identity as Aboriginal people, justas so many other aspects of the non-Aboriginal world have been adapted and modifiedto benefit our people.But this type of adaptation and integration must include a serious reflection onhow we adapt, how we approach our research tasks. If we merely learn the \"tools ofthe trade\" for research and put them onto our people, we will be performing anothertype of colonization and participating in a hegemonic proliferation. And we will not beexercising our uniqueness and creativity as a people.In my interviews with many Aboriginal people in the last two years, my hearthas been deeply touched by people who are experiencing a fear and a sorrow that wewill lose our uniqueness and, therefore, lose \"who we are.\" I hear this fear expressedby elders, by teachers, by leaders, and, unfortunately, by children themselves.As Aboriginal researchers, we can know who we are. We can make theacademie our place. We can feel safe enough, through ritual practice, not only to survive the university, but to thrive and to be creative in our expressions. Sometimes,this journey of making safe places for elaborate growth is done together, andsometimes it is done alone.Spirit is our source. It is through spirit that we can see the vision of theinterconnectedness of all things and receive the strength to bring that vision into ourlives as Aboriginal peoples, as scholars in the university. Now we have enoughAboriginal scholars within the academie to be prepared. Of course, each of us hascontributed in different degrees. But, as a group, we can imagine that we havecompleted the state of preparation and that we are ready to move on to the next stageof engagement and enactment with our full natures. In this way, we can make theuniversities our own places, places where we truly belong, no longer sites of struggle,but rather nurturing and supportive environments in which our creativity andresourcefulness can thrive. We can fly. Now, this would be \"higher\" education.

Ottawa: Government ofCanada the Woodlands Cree Cathy Wheaton Prior to writing this paper, I was, at the time, struggling with the question\"What is Native Studies?\" This question was very difficult to answer, although I was inmy fourth year of study. I found myself unable to answer the question, as I was,instead, focusing on two separate aspects of the question itself. I was being pulled intwo directions, the reality of how I had experienced Native Studies and what I hadactually hoped to learn.I then created two lists; one of them covered the topics withinmy classes and a second listing all the content and approaches I had envisioned. Thetwo lists differed greatly. The list of topics describing the classes was very disjointed. Itfocused on every major issue of Aboriginal people in Canada, but never in the cohesivemanner I would have liked. Rarely did I see the connections being directly drawnbetween all the different approaches in regards to the lives of Aboriginal people.My first list of topics encompassed health, justice, politics, sociology, culturaltraditions and other aspects of Aboriginal people. This fragmented and artificialseparation of the life aspects of Aboriginal people did not consider how these kinds ofartificial divides were, in themselves, problematic. In addition, their division intocategories depended upon other distortions and misinterpretations as scholars tried toreassemble the \"puzzle\" that Aboriginal people seemed to appear to them.Previous to this, I had looked at Aboriginal people, myself included, as totalcomplete beings, not as jigsaw puzzles. It was very difficult to reassemble the partsand place them back into the context of what I was already familiar with. Aboriginalpeople appeared within academic writing as an object of study, and scholars' dissectionof them was a regular occurrence. I often had to mentally re-center myself in order todetermine how certain focuses were relevant in a more holistic way. I realized thatfocusing on such narrow dimensions of Aboriginal people was, in fact, a large part of thetotal dehumanization process that began by colonial activity since contact. We were 151163 said to have progressed within this field so we could dispel the images of savages andnoble redskins, but we seemed to replace them with the lifeless products of scientificstudy. We, once again, had become objects of colonial practices, our own identitiesbeing determined by others. And yet, I found that what really struck me about otherAboriginal people was their strength, determination, and vision for the future. By failingto mention these very important aspects of Aboriginal people, academics were creatingfalse images.Within Native Studies, I also heard about the superiority of our discipline incomparison to other disciplines that attempted to study Aboriginal people. In classes,professors would often talk about the value and importance of oral history and how ithad been ignored by other disciplines. Native Studies claimed to appreciate oral historyas a valuable addition to historical and other research. They also talked abouttraditional knowledge, and elders' contributions. And yet, the professors who lecturedon these important aspects of our field had never actually incorporated these elementsof Aboriginal knowledge into their own course content. They, instead, continued to rantand rave about the inadequacies of competing disciplines, while using the samemethodologies and approaches in their own work. Rarely did I see academics differ intheir approaches from what they had been taught as students. They rarely reachedoutside of their disciplinary frameworks to add oral or other types of Aboriginalknowledge to their repertoire. They refused to educate themselves in the importantaspects they criticized others for omitting. They continued, instead, to fragment theview of Aboriginal people in their own descriptions. I, of course, was confused, as I hadexpected someone to at least attempt to add some semblance of these missingelements into their classes.My partner and I often discuss these issues. He presently teaches in IndianStudies and incorporates oral narratives and Aboriginal language into his course work.Aboriginal students appreciate this type of content, and its relevance to all students isreadily apparent when the connection between the content of the courses and thereality of Aboriginal people, about whom they are studying, is made. Imagine a class onCree history and culture, utilizing Cree oral traditions, teaching with a narrative style andstudying Cree words in order to more fully understand Cree ways. I have witnessed thishappening. And, I find it rather upsetting to realize that many scholars will insteadcontinue to teach in a fundamentally different way, in a field that they have claimed isdifferent. I still have some questions about improving the discipline. Why is it that theproblems identified within conventional academic approaches in Native Studies do notgo beyond criticism? Why do academics continue to rely exclusively on writtenacademic sources for the bulk of their content? An occasional guest lecture by anAboriginal speaker cannot compensate for an instructor's inadequate inclusion of thesesources in their course material.An Aboriginal student may be able to compensate for their instructor's gaps bysupplementing with their own experiences at times. But should this still occur? Andwhat about others who are training to work for Aboriginal people; how can they beexpected to fill in the missing pieces? Academics have an obligation to not repeat themistakes of the disciplines they criticize.I also wonder if it is possible to unite all the differing approaches containedwithin Native Studies into an all-encompassing methodology that would be true toAboriginal people's existence? I now realize that Native Studies was, in fact, amechanism that forced Aboriginal people to fit into non-Aboriginal conceptions ofAboriginal people. By basing Native Studies on the non-Aboriginal methodologies oflaw, anthropology, history and sociology, academics had carried over its baggage. It isno longer possible to convey or explore Aboriginal people as the actor in their own lives.They, instead, became the \"Other\" as non-Aboriginal academics trapped them intocompartments of non-Aboriginal origin.So, how do we remedy such an enormous difficulty? I quickly realized thattrying to resolve the problems inherent in non-Aboriginal approaches was futile, and Icould not effectively reconstruct non-Aboriginal methodologies that were borne out ofnon-Aboriginal construction. In this paper, I decided to overlook the entire structure ofNative Studies. My first step was to look first at how students were learning in NativeStudies and the university.I believed that Aboriginal-based content would not be totallyeffective if the means of teaching it were inconsistent with its aim. I needed to beginwith the students and then work from the students outward. I believe in Aboriginalknowledge, its content and its dissemination. As a very recent graduate, I think that, bybeginning with students, I can readily use this as my orientation.The pedagogical model that I will recover may not, at first, appear to belong ina university setting. Its processes are derived from an Aboriginal home and not theuniversity. Yet, it is appropriate to begin from this location, and through a relationshipthat more truly welcomes Aboriginal conceptions of epistemology. 153165 Before I move on, I must first consider how much of the present universitycourse material is being taught in Native Studies classrooms. It is usually the norm forthe so-called expert to lecture to the students. Previous to this stage, a scholar, withuniversity recognized credentials endeavored to briefly study a group of people, ofwhom he or she is not a member and cannot communicate with well. He or she willusually observe the group for a brief time, write copious notes, compile them, writethem up, publish it and thus becomes the expert. Their writing will then be referred toin classes which assists in teaching about the group of people studied. This will evenoccur if the group members are physically present as students. These academicscholars will frequently reveal only a narrow, poorly interpreted view of the people theystudied, and never acknowledge that the small part that they dissected is part of a totalbeing that is unable to function as a whole due to its dismemberment. These pieces willthen be used to provide evidence to prove their theories. These are the materials fromwhich new paradigms emerge. If this is the process by which Native Studies educationis received by Native Studies students, it is resting upon abstractions of reality andcannot be expected to depict Aboriginal people to others.Another serious flaw of common approaches in Native Studies is based on theacademy's separation of the secular and belief systems of Aboriginal people. Byencouraging this division when studying the unified aspects of Aboriginal people's lives,they obstruct a holistic approach to Aboriginal epistemology. Aboriginal epistemologymust remain intact with its components in order to be true to its origins. And yet, manydominant, non-Aboriginal, theoretical perspectives resist belief systems, landscapes thatnurture them, kinship ties that hold Aboriginal people together, the stories which passon their history to other generations, and the on-going changes that occur to allAboriginal people in Canada.Within conventional history, Aboriginal people are described in terms of theiraccomplishments as noted by documented sources. The Aboriginal people who are theirdescendants play a very minor role in conventional historical approaches. Conventionalhistorical approaches also create artificial boundaries between the past and present, andattempt to destroy the continuum that exists. This continuum does not cease to existbecause the past events of Aboriginal people have been carried forward to ourgeneration. When historians look at Aboriginal people without regard for this culturallyreinforced notion of non-linear dynamism, they distort the realities of Aboriginalexistence itself to their students, and others. 154166 Another problem often encountered in Native Studies is diversity amongAboriginal people. In its efforts to appear all-knowing and to portray a consistentpicture of Aboriginal people across a wide range, these departments often disregard theimmense diversity within them. Within Saskatchewan, focusing only on linguisticdiversity, we have groups from Woodlands Cree, Plains Cree, Swampy Cree, Saulteaux,Dene, Nakota, Dakota, and Lakota families. Yet, these linguistic groups have shifted,have blended with neighboring groups, and have absorbed each other's people. Andyet, these people are depicted as being static and similar to one another. It is veryoffensive to tell an Aboriginal person that is familiar with the history of their own lineagethat their traditions are determined by one set of descriptors when, in reality, there canbe wide ranges within groups themselves. Although I myself am Cree, I do not find asmany similarities with other Cree groups outside of northern Saskatchewan, althoughwe may share linguistic preferences. Our lifestyles within our tribal history havechanged and continue to change in response to changes in our surroundings. Theurban Cree and the land-based Cree are not the same and each deal with differentcircumstances in different ways. By ignoring their realities, academics describe stereo-typical Crees who have remained static during the course of their existence. It appearsto be easier to depict an enormous group of people as one homogeneous, massivegroup.All of these linear perspectives attempt to dictate to Aboriginal people who theyare and have framed the questions concerning their existence. Is it appropriate for non-Aboriginal people to attempt to ask questions about Aboriginal people if they areunaware of these very crucial nuances of difference? Is it appropriate for scholars toformulate answers without the active input of Aboriginal people? I believe thatAboriginal scholars, who are already familiar with these differences, are moreadequately prepared to derive questions, and the subtle ways in which we can exploretheir answers. It is disrespectful to exclude Aboriginal people from their own existenceexcept to simply provide evidence to support non-Aboriginal conceptions of Aboriginalpeople. I think that Aboriginal people should be the active participants in identifyingtheir knowledge, and that they should determine how this will happen.Many academics refuse to acknowledge that Aboriginal people's existence andconceptions of themselves are very different from their own. Objectification does notconvey a \"true\" picture of anyone; objectification, in fact, creates a false image ofAboriginal people, more like a caricature than a portrait. If Aboriginal people determine 155167 how the picture of them should be created, and with what materials and techniques, thefinal composition will more accurately depict Aboriginal people and the vitality of theirlives. Too often, academics seem to prefer a lifeless, flat image in comparison to anexciting vital one.Aboriginal people's dynamism is like the world in which they live. Bothconstantly change, and remain largely unpredictable and incredibly complex. The worlddoes not revolve around the ideas of human beings; human beings cope with the worldthey inhabit. We are only a part of the huge network of life on the planet. AndAboriginal people do not follow the contrived theoretical frameworks of intellects whocannot comprehend the complex contents of Aboriginal lives. The university mustrefrain from its continuing attempts to frame the dynamism of Aboriginal existence. Ihope, instead, to urge a commitment from you, as scholars, to commit to concentrateon how Aboriginal people have always seen their own existence instead of trying tolayer another people's existence on them. Aboriginal dynamism should frame our work.We must look internally, as Aboriginal people, to revive old ways and use them withineducation in the present context. The old ways have already proven their worth by thesurvival of our people.An internal type of inquiry may yield new approaches for Native Studies. I amreluctant to call Aboriginal epistemological frameworks theories. They are more fluidthan theories, and have the ability to cope with change in exceptional ways. Many non-Aboriginal approaches cannot cope with the reality of Aboriginal people. Non-Aboriginaltheoretical approaches can often be very rigid when they encounter difference withinAboriginal people; they often collapse under the weight of continuing changes.Much of what I have already learned as a Woodlands Cree differs drasticallyfrom my non-Aboriginal based and delivered education. Within the setting of theuniversity, I was presented with abstract theories about Aboriginal people. Thelegitimacy of this knowledge was often based upon positivist thinking. Inherent to thevalidation of 'legitimate' knowledge was objectivity. Cursory attention was, or is, paid toreal-life Aboriginal experiences that are often transmitted through oral accounts andnarratives.I have spent many years trying to decipher the language of an abstract,academic world to determine whether it is relevant to my conceptions as an Aboriginalperson. Professors talked about my people as if they were mere concepts instead offlesh and blood human beings. I have also listened to romantic approaches that haveidealized and mystified Aboriginal people. This process of dehumanization and .16 3_156 idealization will continue unless we take another direction. Aboriginal people, who arestripped of their capacities to change, adapt and discover their own paths in a world willnot thrive. Many of the conceptions of Aboriginal life by my instructors did notencompass my own experience. Now, I wish to add my own experience to counter thisfeeling of discomfort, and suggest we base teaching and learning on Aboriginalexperiences. Through this method, we can also demonstrate how we can use Aboriginalepistemology as our source of knowledge to improve the discipline of Native Studies.Let me begin by relating a story of my own.I will be moving, in this paper, from the artificial environment of the universityand into an organic environment. Many structures within the academy are not willing toaccept an Aboriginal approach to knowledge. But, I will return to the knowledge of mypeople to recover and reclaim a new way of inquiry, and bring it to the academy toprepare a safe place for the knowledge that has been passed.My people educated themselves and survived for eons prior to the arrival ofEuropeans. They already possessed the learning and teaching methods that ensuredtheir continual survival in spite of tremendous changes. Europeans told us oureducation was inadequate and unable to assist us in adapting to our new circumstances.In retrospect, if this were true, I would not be here today. I am confident that the waysof my own people possessed great strengths, as evidenced by their continuingexistence. By going directly to myself, my own family and my ancestors as my sourceof knowledge, I have discovered that the land itself was integral to how my peopleviewed the world and our place within it. Before I tell you about my experience, I needto talk about my relationship with the land so you may understand why I believe thisrelationship is so influential.Many Woodlands Cree feel strongly about remaining connected to the landbase in order to practice traditional lifestyles. Like many Woodland Cree, I was able toexperience many learning experiences while occupying the land and sustaining myselfupon it.I now possess a concrete and deep spiritual bond with the earth. By occupyingthe land for long periods of time as a child, I grew attached to it. My experiences weredeeply felt and continue to draw me back to the land even today. My connection withthe earth has created my sense of location within creation. The land has enabled myreasons for existence to become clear. Like my ancestors, I do not question myexistence when I occupy the land. By living and becoming part of creation itself, I nowpossess a strong sense of how and where I was meant to live. A traditional lifestyle on the land does not challenge the original intents of the Creator who placed my ancestorshere long ago. When I co-exist with the earth, it becomes apparent why I oftenexperience discomfort in my life as I live bound by artificial structures. My self-imposedexile from the earth has created a sense of loss and loneliness at times. It is physicallyand emotionally draining to constantly renegotiate my destiny away from the land as Icontinue to live in an urban space. It is frustrating for me to cope with the void I havecreated.I feel, in many ways, that this void is a large reason why so many of ourpeople are lost and unhappy within cities. Yet, living on the land as an AboriginalIndigenous person is an almost impossible goal when we reflect on how the world haschanged for our people. It will be a difficult journey for our children as they facegreater changes in the future. We need to also realize that this land relationship shouldbe included in our own discussions with each other. This is why I have chosen theexperience that I will relate to you and why this experience has yielded an Aboriginalpedagogy. I believe that a similar kind of process is at the heart of recovering otherAboriginal models on which to base Native Studies.I want to talk about the education I have received from my family. My mothertaught me skills intrinsic to my people's traditional lifestyles which were land-based.The lifestyles of my family have changed only recently, since my mother's generation.It was the norm in my family to know certain skills in order to follow a traditionallifestyle as a Woodland people. I am fortunate in that I use personal experiences tocontemplate traditional teachings. I draw upon these experiences to recover anAboriginal pedagogical model to base teaching and learning. How did my family teachand learn the skills they needed to survive? My people (the Woodlands Cree), for manycountless generations, have sustained themselves by learning living by the rules of theenvironment. This environment was not static or artificial. They coped with its changeson a daily basis. Through their connection to the land, they derived knowledge from theearth itself. This is my source of the Aboriginal pedagogy I hope to add to NativeStudies. Native Studies is fundamentally flawed due to its non-Aboriginalorigins/stances. By finding a new location for learning itself, a new way of thinkingabout knowledge acquisition that encompasses Aboriginal epistemology can begin to berealized.I realized that an Aboriginal pedagogy would support and strengthenAboriginal epistemology. This is the primary goal of this model.The story that follows is the result of my internal search for an Aboriginallearning experience.I began to recall what I had learned from my many experiences 1 70158 within the environment of the 'bush.' My mother taught me many things, but oneexample I wish to relate is the dynamics of Aboriginal learning within my family. I hadlearned to catch rabbits at a very young age. I purposely talk about this skill as itdemonstrates the success of Aboriginal pedagogy with a young child. If an eight-year-old is able to acquire the skills necessary to capture a rabbit with only a piece of wire, itmust be a good example of successful teaching and learning.Although I was very young, I was able to freely wander through the bush as achild. My parents trusted me to be sensible in walking around the bush alone, and Iknew I would not wander aimlessly. I was always walking through the trees looking forberries and plants, and pretending to hunt for animals. I'll never forget the day Iactually did get lost, but I found my way back and never told my parents that I hadwalked for hours trying to find my way back. I realized that, by carefully listening andwalking towards the lake and then following its shoreline, I would eventually get back. Idid.I had often accompanied my mother when she worked in the bush. My fatherhad also built a home for us to live in from trees that grew in the area. My mother hadno need to rely on store-bought goods for our food. We often ate wild chickens, ducks,rabbits, and fishwhatever was caught. She was able to find food all around us. Iremember one time I cried for candy and she gave me the gum from a spruce tree tochew. It was bitter at first, but I was amazed at how even candy was provided by theland. She also showed me which plants and berries were suitable for eating and whichto avoid. She told me the names of the plants and told me how, when she was a littlegirl, she ate the very same things. I knew how to make a sling shot and a toy bow andarrow to play with, how to build a fire, how to prepare wild food, and how to observemy surroundings. She also taught me about dangers, to avoid the water when alone asmany children had lost their lives by not respecting its dangers.I walked with my mother as she set rabbit snares, watching intently and withamazement as my mother would carefully choose an appropriate path on which to set arabbit snare and catch a rabbit. She looked carefully for a well-travelled trail and thenproceeded to attach a pre-made wire noose to an adjacent tree. While she was actuallysetting a wire snare, she told me of the reasons why she placed small branches aroundthe snare, \"You want the rabbit to go in the snare instead of around it/' she commentedas she placed small obstacles around the noose. I wondered how the rabbits could notnotice the wire snare and why they wouldn't just go around it. But, my mother 159 explained that rabbits run very fast and that they travelled along the same path so theycould eventually be trapped. I watched how she attached each snare and askedquestions throughout the process. Only later would I realize how complicated a processmy mother was performing. My mother would always set several snares at a time in thehope of catching at least one rabbit for a meal. The next day, we would return to our'trapline' and see if any of the snares had trapped a rabbit. With luck, we would get atleast one rabbit.My mother was never angry or disappointed if she did not catch anything, but,rather, she exhibited an acceptance about not being successful and told me that,sometimes, the rabbits don't go where we want them to. By explaining this, I learnedthat I needed to be patient and persistent. I also learned not to question my methods ifthey did not always yield results. She told me that it was silly to get mad at events overwhich we had no control. She was not able to make a rabbit go where she wanted, andneither was I.Sometimes, we would catch several and then I would watch how she preparedand cooked them. Soon, my mother allowed me to set my own snares, but, of course, Iwas not successful at first.I would always wonder why she was so much luckier than Iwas. I did not, at first, realize the precise way in which she had actually set her snares.I continued to accompany her on her own snare-setting and soon began to notice moreof the necessary details she demonstrated why she was more successful. She wouldalso provide guidance by looking at my snares and telling me how they were improperlyset. She would also later advise me as to how I should consider where and how therabbit ran in order to set my snare properly. \"Your trails are no longer being used\" or\"The snare is too low\" were reminders of oversights I had made in my observation ofher own techniques in catching rabbits.Again and again, I set my own snares with the hope that I would eventuallyperfect my skill. Although I was very young at the time, my parents knew that I wasable to set my own rabbit snares without them being with me. I became more andmore attentive to the details of how my mother performed her snare setting andgradually I mimicked her methods in my attempts. I continuously thought about myoversights and persisted until, one day, I was successful. By watching her and seeingher persistence, I had learned that the process of learning was something long, but notpointless. I '74160 What did I discover from this particular example of Aboriginal learning? Howdid I identify the successful features of this system of learning which functions withoutthe use of the abstract or written word? One of the first steps I determined inrecovering this system of learning was the identification of multiple processes oflearning. One of the first things I noted was the non-linear process of learning. It wasa complex cycle of learning and was composed of several fundamental processes thatoccurred continuously.I became aware of this knowledge recently although, at thetime, I was immersed in it.Perhaps, this was why I had not previously identified it.Yet, when I began to identify the characteristics of how learning occurred in my ownchildhood, I realized that my more formal methods of education were, in fact, missingmany of the fundamental processes I later identified. This led me to think that theseprocesses were, in fact, necessary and helped to explain to me why the knowledge Ihad received in non-Aboriginal institutions were inadequate.I finally began to list some of what I saw as being essential to the process oflearning that I derived. The processes I identified were: observation, experience,introspection and inquiry. These four processes supported each other and occurredboth simultaneously and sequentially within the learning style that I have described.The process itself was complex, not following a regular pattern, coping with my ownlearning abilities.All four processes were necessary in this experience and others sothat I could engage myself fully in the process of learning within this model.The first major process in this model of learning is the process ofobserVation. As a child, I was exposed to the active process of capturing rabbits bymy mother by being physically present in order to note how another person snaresrabbits.I was, therefore, able to learn in the initial stage of the learning cycle byphysically surveying a process and also using inquiry and introspection prior to actuallyengaging in it.I inquired about aspects of the task that puzzled me. I was also givenadditional information from my mother, as teacher, as she frequently explained why shedid certain things in certain ways. This additional information informed me about theact itself, its processes, and the details of it, so that I could use this information when Ilater tried to perform the task myself. She also taught me that observation was anactive process and that I needed to be wholly observant with my mind as well as mysenses. Questioning aspects of what I observed allowed me to more fully realize allaspects of what was before me. It taught me to observe certain things in her task thatI may have not otherwise noticed. 1611 73 During the period of observation, I was also taught that tasks and theirmethods of accomplishment were valid, as I was actually seeing them in practice. Iidentified the efficiency due to my observation of them in practice, and also knew thatthese same methods had been handed down to my mother from other skilled trappers.My maternal grandfather was a trapper and my grandmother was also skilled atprocuring animals for food. The very survival of my family and their ancestors wereliving proof of the validity of the methods used to acquire food. The process ofobservation was, in itself, a multiple stage in the learning process.The next process that I identified during the learning process was experience.I now had a rudimentary training through observation, but the next step, for me, was togain the skill of snaring through actual practice in order to move from the abstract tothe actual experience of snaring. Once I began to actually try to snare on my own, Isoon realized that what I had initially observed was not as easy as it looked. I realizedthat there were many hidden skills that I had not remembered or paid as muchattention to, and these oversights resulted in my initial attempts to capture a rabbit tofail.I found myself then engaging in another step in the learning process,introspection. I needed to look at my teacher's successes and my own attempts atsuccess in my task in a way that allowed me to formulate strategies to complete mytask. My failure, followed by reflection on what I had done, in order to figure out why Ihad been unsuccessful, was vital. I then began to try these new ideas again in practicein order to increase my chances of success. I also began to again engage in observingmy mother who was already successful in the task, in order to observe her actions forthe procedures that she used that I was missing or doing incorrectly. My mother alsoaccompanied me to my own snares and would be able to simply look at my snares andtell me what I was doing wrong. I then continued to set more snares, trying toremember what to watch for, and found I was soon successful at my attempts. I alsobegan to question my teacher more about ways in which to increase my success andlearned that inquiry was also a necessary process when learning through this method.I discovered that, in order to facilitate this learning style, the teacher needed tobe aware of the necessity of all the processes to occur or my learning would benegatively affected. Had my mother prevented me from watching her perform the taskI later learned, or discouraged my inquiry of it, I would have been prevented from later 162 performing the task on my own. Her teaching style allowed me to go through all fourprocesses many times. I learned a skill that many adults may never learn.My mother was aware of my need to learn this skill through multiple processes.And this knowledge was passed on to her through her own learning of similar tasks byher parents, in addition to the passing on of traditional knowledge from countlessprevious generations. It was an intrinsic part of her, as a Woodlands Cree woman,being raised on the land that she occupied. It was not until she was forcibly removedfrom this environment, and went through the residential school experience, that thelearning styles of her ancestors lost their influence.If we contrast and compare this process of education with non-Aboriginalbased processed of education, we can begin to see why the absence of these particularprocesses of education creates tremendous difficulty in teaching students to learn aboutAboriginal people and their own knowledge. In observing non-Aboriginal pedagogy, wesee an emphasis on the teacher simply telling the student things without observation orexperience. Because the student does not have the support of these active processes,knowledge that is transmitted becomes abstract and is disconnected to a real event.Because neither the student nor the teacher is active, concepts remain abstract andincomprehensible. The non-Aboriginal instructor, and the ideas on which the instructorbases his or her teachings, is largely devoid of either direct or indirect experience and,therefore, never achieves a state of reality from the students or even the instructor'sperspective. All that really supports what they hear and repeat is the faith that whatthey consider knowledge is, in fact, true. They have no other basis to believe this kindof knowledge. They rely, instead, on the written word which relates experiences fromdistant and removed participants who have no links to the knowledge that they teach.I have been questioned on these processes and their applicability in thecontext of teaching in other settings that are non-Aboriginal. I wish to assert that theseprocesses are, in fact, a valuable addition to the present systems of education in anyteaching topic, not only when attempting to teach about Aboriginal people. Byincorporating observation, experience, introspection and inquiry during the educationprocess, we will begin to create linkages from the experiences of human beings andtransmit them wholly to students in the classroom. We are, unfortunately, limited bythis setting within school classrooms of being able to convey all dimensions of humanexperience, but, by striving to be as inclusive as possible, we can approach the goals ofholistic teaching and learning. 163 History itself, when viewed as being separate from the present and the future,can become vital to its students when those who have linkages to past historical eventsare brought into the classroom. By looking at history strictly through the written word,we lose its human aspect and fail to convey all of its nuances. Students also need to beable to see how and why history is relevant to them and people who experienced it firsthand. Within many Aboriginal families, history has retained its linkages to the pastthrough its descendants who have been taught its relevance. It is unlikely that a personwho is removed from the lifestyles and daily occurrences of this training can adequatelyrelate historical events properly to others.Much of what I am responding to is an absence or a distance created byeducational institutions in their efforts to attempt to teach knowledge of Aboriginalpeople.I propose that, by adding experience, direct and indirect, we can shorten thisdistance and fill in the gaps in a way that facilitates learning itself. For many students,the process of learning has become a separate entity which remains disconnected fromtheir lives'. Knowledge needs to be nurtured and delivered in ways that enable studentsto respond to it in a more meaningful way. For many students, knowledge fails to berelevant to their own experiences, and the relationship between what the teachers teachand what they experience outside of the school classroom are often very different. Ifteachers are not able to bring these different aspects of education closer together, manystudents will continue their classes with little knowledge and no skills with which to learnand educate themselves. In Native Studies, we are further urged to find a pathwaytowards knowledge of our own that stresses our own values and knowledge in anAboriginal way. We should utilize many Aboriginal models as a means to enrich oureducation at the University. For many non-Aboriginal students, this experience will betruly enlightening. Seeing relevance in the context of the classroom must become apriority for those who teach others. Students now have to find this for themselves;some never acquire the ability to do so.If we look to Aboriginal elders, we see that their own methods of teaching arevery much in line with the learning processes I have described. Elders talk about thingsand experiences using stories, and drawing important lessons upon them. They alsoactively involve the student. Students are encouraged to be introspective and to drawtheir own conclusions on their responses to oral narratives. Serious teachings are notcontrived, they are real!Inquiry is a very important aspect of how they counselstudents. They leave room for students themselves to inquire as to why things occur, and do not attempt to create knowledge, but help students to derive it. Oral narrativesoffer new experiences upon which to draw from while relaying the accumulatedknowledge of others. Elders are constantly deriving teachings from knowledge thatexists. They do not attempt to present the abstract as the reality itself. Abstractconcepts in the non-Aboriginal world are, in fact, based on real and experience-basedconceptions, but these linkages have been separated by the division between humansand the earth they occupy, and the severing of their connection with their past.Why are these four processes necessary in this particular process of learning?The first step, observation, is the initial step when actively introducing someone to askill. The teachers must repeat the process with the student present in order for thestudent to gain a basic understanding of the actual process. However, the teacherengages the student in inquiry if the student asks why the teacher is doing the task in acertain way. The teacher may explain the reasons immediately or decide that thestudent needs to view the process more thoroughly and tells the student that theprocess of observation needs to continue. This teaches the student the value of carefulobservation and patience in becoming skilled at each step in the learning process.Thinking and questioning are also necessary in order to utilize the experiences ofpractice to realize education to its highest potential.There are situations when elders will purposely not tell a person the answer toa question even if they know it. Instead, the elder may encourage the student tobecome introspective and inquire deeply about the answer to a question. Elders knowand understand the value of experiential learning and often use the indirect experienceof stories to add the experiential dimension to the learning process. They realize thatready solutions can lead a person to make decisions without the addition ofintrospection, and lead to the reluctance of the student to think about what and whythey do what they do. Elders will frequently tell young people to place their problems, inperspective with the totality of their lives and to think about what they are asking.Elders realize that, if the student is not fully cognizant of the context of the situation,any further action may be misguided. The need for the student to become introspectiveabout their problems, and to appreciate the value of adept observation, will reinforcetheir learning. They realize that a student who neglects to conceptualize the context oftheir situation without this critical reflection cannot become introspective in ameaningful way. Elders recognize the need of students to involve themselves in aprocess that involves meaningful inquiry and introspection in order to prepare the 165 students' minds for learning. It is not meaningful or productive in the learning processto expect instant answers to difficult questions.They also stress the need to connect experience and practice to knowledge tovalidate it for the student. They do not guess at the answers if they are unsure. Eldersdo not pretend to know about matters in which they have no experience. They willoften suggest going to another more knowledgeable person for answers that theycannot provide. Students who learn in this manner are also critical thinkers who knowhow to judge the validity of knowledge that they receive. By relying on all fourprocesses of understanding, they can acquire a holistic awareness of the world in whichthey live.We may realize other aspects of holistic pedagogical approaches when we useour entire intellect during the learning process. At the same time, we embed theknowledge we learn through multiple processes of learning. This pedagogical modeldemonstrates the importance of observation, experience, inquiry and introspection asvital elements. These processes demand critical skills from its student and yield a totallearning experience. I hope that I have shown how an Aboriginal learning system canbe applied in the academy. Through the examination of oral narratives, we canconceive of ways of learning and creating a Native Studies that truly educates aboutAboriginal people.

There are no simpleprescriptions in response to that question, but there are some strategies you can drawupon to guide you into a new teaching situation and help you adapt your teachingpractices to better serve the unique educational needs of that cultural community. Thecompilation of tips and advice that follows is a distillation of the experiences of manyeducators who have learned to adapt their work to the physical and culturalenvironment in which they are located. Although the author's experiences have beendrawn mostly from work in Native villages in rural Alaska, the issues will be addressed inways that are applicable in any setting involving people from diverse culturalbackgrounds.While a condensed version of such a complex subject runs the risk of over-simplification and misinterpretation, it is offered here as a starting point for an on-goingjourney of personal exploration and cross-cultural sensitization that each of us aseducatorsNative or non-Nativemust undertake if we are to relate to people fromother cultural backgrounds in a respectful and constructive manner. When we learn torelate to each other and teach in a culturally considerate way, we benefit not only thosewith whom we work, but we benefit ourselves as well. We are all cultural beings, andaccelerating changes in the makeup of the world around us makes that fact anincreasingly obvious and inescapable aspect of our daily existence. How then can wetake culture into account in our work as educators?How do you enter a new cultural community?First impressions count! The way you present yourself to people in a newcommunity will have a lasting impact on how they perceive and relate to you and, 167179 consequently, on how you perceive them. This is especially true in a small village whereeveryone lives in close proximity to one another, but it is also true in the context ofclassrooms as micro-communities. The first thing to remember is that many otherteachers have come and gone before you, so students and parents have developed theirown way of making sense out of their relationships with strangers. While this may be anew experience for you, it is not for the host community. The background andperspective you bring to the situation, particularly in terms of cross-cultural experience,will have a major bearing on how you present yourself in a new setting. If you havetaught previously in a comparable community, or are yourself from a similar culturalbackground (e.g., an indigenous teacher), you will have relationships and experiences tobuild upon when you enter the new community that a beginning teacher without thatprior experience will not have available. For the purposes of making this limited reviewas useful as possible, the emphasis will be on the latter situation, where the teacher isassumed to be starting from scratch in a new community and/or cultural situation.The biggest challenge you face is getting to know people on their own termsand letting them get to know you as a person, rather than just as a \"teacher.\" Thetendency for people who make their living off the printed word is to turn to the nearestlibrary or bookstore when confronted with a new situation about which they lackinformation. While it may be useful to acquire some basic factual information aboutyour new cultural home beforehand, most of what you need to know about the peopleand the community that you will be working with is probably best acquired firsthand,with minimal influence from someone else's perceptual filters. The fewer priorconceptions and the less cultural baggage that you carry into the situation, the morelikely that you will be able to avoid jumping to superficial conclusions, leaving you freeto learn what it takes to make a constructive entry into the local flow of life.There are many layers of shared understanding in any cultural community, andfor an outsider to even begin to recognize that the deeper layers exist requires aconsiderable openness of mind and a great deal of time and effort. Our firstimpressions of a new culture are usually formed in response to the more obvioussurface aspects that we can see, hear, and relate to our own prior experience, so it isimportant to withhold judgement and defer closure on our interpretation of behaviorand events as long as possible. Once we arrive at a conclusion or form an opinion, webegin to rely on that explanation for guiding our subsequent behavior, and hesitate toassimilate new information that may lead to a deeper understanding. The resulting 168 myopia can contribute to numerous problems, including inappropriately low expectationsregarding student abilities.We can minimize the potential problems outlined above and accelerate ourimmersion into a new cultural community in a number of ways. If the opportunityexists, one of the most useful steps you can take is to get involved in the communitywell before you assume the role of teacher. Let people get to know you as a personfirst, and this will have enormous payoff in everything that you do as a teacher. Ifpossible and appropriate, get involved in the community where your students live earlyenough to join in traditional summer activities, so you can get to know people on theirterms and begin to see life through their eyes. If early arrival is not possible, start theschool year with an extended camp experience with your students and other membersof the community. This will enable you to make your classroom lessons much moremeaningful for your students, and it will open up avenues of communication that will bebeneficial to everyone involved.If you are looking for a place to live, consider how your housing and lifestylewill set you off from, or help you blend into, the community. While housing that setsyou apart from the community may be convenient (when available), you pay a price interms of your relationship to the rest of the community. Whenever possible, chooseimmersion over isolation, but don't forget who you are in the process. You will be morerespected for being yourself than for \"going Native.\" Seek advice from the practitionersof the culture in which you are situated, and always convey respect for their ways,recognizing that you are a guest in someone else's community. If you encountersituations of apparent social breakdown and dysfunctionality, be especially careful toexercise discretion and obtain the views of others before you take any precipitousaction.The most important consideration when entering a new cultural community iskeeping an open mind and accepting people on their own terms. A little attention tohow you present yourself in the beginning can make a big difference in your relation-ships for the remainder of your stay in the community. First impressions do count!What do you need to know?Since learning a culture is a lifetime undertaking, where do you as a newcomerstart, and what are the most important aspects to be considered? One of the firstthings to recognize is that the more you learn about another culture, the more you willfind out about yourself. We all carry around our own sub-conscious culturally 1691 8 I conditioned filters for making sense out of the world around us, and it isn't until weencounter people with a substantially different set of filters that we have to confront theassumptions, predispositions and beliefs that we take for granted and which make uswho we are. To illustrate how those differences can come into play, the following chartsummarizes some of the characteristics that tend to distinguish the view of the world asexhibited in many indigenous societies from that embodied in Western scientifictradition.Indigenous World ViewSpirituality is imbedded in all elementsof the cosmosHumans have responsibility formaintaining harmonious relationshipswith the natural for reciprocity between humanand natural worldsresources areviewed as giftsNature is honored routinely throughdaily spiritual practiceWisdom and ethics are derived fromdirect experience with the naturalworldUniverse is made up of dynamic, ever-changing natural forcesUniverse is viewed as a holistic,integrative system with a unifying lifeforceTime is circular with natural cycles thatsustain all lifeNature will always possessunfathomable mysteriesHuman thought, feelings and wordsare inextricably bound to all otheraspects of the universeHuman role is to participate in theorderly designs of natureWestern World ViewSpirituality is centered in a single SupremeBeingHumans exercise dominion over nature touse it for personal and economic gain Natural resources are available for unilateralhuman exploitation Spiritual practices are intermittent and setapart from daily lifeHuman reason transcends the natural worldand can produce insights independently Universe is made up of an array of staticphysical objectsUniverse is compartmentalized in dualisticforms and reduced to progressively smallerconceptual partsTime is a linear chronology of \"humanprogress\"Nature is completely decipherable to therational human mindHuman thought, feelings and words areformed apart from the surrounding world Human role is to dissect, analyze andmanipulate nature for own ends 170 Respect for elders is based on theircompassion and reconciliation of outer-and inner-directed knowledgeSense of empathy and kinship withother forms of lifeView proper human relationship withnature as a continuous two-way,transactional dialogueRespect for others is based on materialachievement and chronological old age Sense of separateness from and superiorityover other forms of lifeView relationship of humans to nature as aone-way, hierarchical imperative (Adapted from Knudtson and Suzuki, 1992) Differences in cultural perspective such as those outlined above have enormousimplications for all aspects of how we approach the tasks of everyday life, not the leastof which is the education of succeeding generations. In most indigenous communitiestoday, it is apparent that aspects of both the indigenous and Western perspectives arepresent in varying degrees, though neither may be present in a fully cohesive fashion.Furthermore, it is not necessary (nor is it possible) for an outsider to fully comprehendthe subtleties and inner workings of another cultural system (even if it is still fullyfunctional) to be able to perform a useful role in that cultural community. What isnecessary, however, is a recognition that such differences do exist, an understanding ofhow these potentially conflicting cultural forces can impact peoples' lives, and awillingness to set aside one's own cultural predispositions long enough to conveyrespect for a. validity of others.The particulars of an unfamiliar cultural system can be effectively attended towithout a thorough knowledge of that culture, as long as you know how to makeappropriate use of local expertise and community resources. As you come tounderstand how another cultural system works, you will also be learning more abouthow culture influences behavior generally, so the particulars of the new situation willlead to tentative generalizations in your own understanding, which, in turn, will help youdecipher the next set of particulars. This should be a never-ending cycle through whichyou continue to learn as much about yourself as you do about others and, along theway, you can expect to face some tough questions, like \"Who am I?\" and \"Why am Ihere?\"questions that we rarely encounter in our own familiar cultural worlds.Two of the most useful steps a new teacher can take to begin to see beyondthe surface features of a new community are getting to know some of the Elders or 171183- other culture-bearers, and becoming familiar with aspects of the local language. Byvisiting Elders in the community, you will be giving evidence of your respect for thecarriers of the local culture, while, at the same time, you will be learning about thevalues, beliefs and rules of cultural behavior that will provide a baseline for yourteaching. Showing enough interest in the local language or dialect to pick up even afew phrases and understand some of its structural features will go a long way towardbuilding your credibility in the community and in helping you recognize the basis forlocal variations on English language use in the classroom. At no point should youassume, however, that you know everything you need to know to fully integrate thelocal culture into your teaching. When learning about another culture, the more youlearn, the more you find that you don't know. Always assume the role of learner, sothat each succeeding year you can look back on the preceding year and wonder howyou could have been so naive. When you think you know it all, it's time to quitteaching.What should you teach?Having negotiated your way into a new cultural community, how do you nowintegrate what you have learned into your teaching? Some of the first concerns you willhave to confront revolve around the expectations of the other teachers, the schooldistrict, and the community, not all of whom may be in agreement on where or how thelocal culture fits into the curriculum. As a professional educator, your first responsibilityis to the students in your charge, but they do not exist in isolation, so you will have tobalance consideration of their individual needs with consideration of the many otherimmediate and distant variables that will come into play in the course of theirexperiences as students and as adults in a rapidly changing world.Your task is to help the students connect to the world around them in waysthat prepare them for the responsibilities and opportunities that they will face as adults.That means they need to know as much as possible about their own immediate world aswell as the larger world in which they are situated, and the inter-relationships betweenthe two. To achieve such a goal requires attention to the local culture in a holistic andintegrative manner across the curriculum, rather than as an add-on component for afew hours a week after attending to the \"real\" curriculum. The baseline for thecurriculum should be the local cultural community, with everything else being built uponand grounded in that reality. 172 Whatever piece of the curriculum you are responsible for, imbed it first in theworld with which the students are familiar and work outward from there. Adapt thecontent to the local scene and then help the students connect it to the region, thenation, and the world. Keep in mind the adage 'Think globally, act locally!\" as youprepare your lessons. If students are to have any influence over their lives as adults,they need to understand who they are, where they fit into the world, and how \"thesystem\" works. It is your responsibility as a teacher to help them achieve thatunderstanding.When considering what to teach, keep in mind that the content of thecurriculum is heavily influenced by the context in which it is taught. Think less in termsof what you are teaching and more in terms of what students might be learning. Howcan you create appropriate learning environments that reinforce what it is you are tryingto teach? Does an Elder telling a traditional story have the same meaning andsignificance when done in a classroom setting as it would have out on the riverbank, orin the Elder's home? More likely not, so carefully consider the kind of situational factors(setting, time, resources, persons involved, etc.) that may have a bearing on what yourstudents are learning. Content cannot be taught apart from context each influencesthe other, and this is especially critical when cultural differences are present. In theend, your most important task is to help students learn how to learn, so while you areteaching subject matter, you also need to be attending to broader process skills, such asproblem solving, decision making, communicating, inductive reasoning, etc. - skills thatare applicable across time and place. It is skills such as these, learned in culturallyadaptive ways, that enable students to put the subject matter they acquire to use inways that are beneficial to themselves, their community and society as a whole.How should you teach?There are as many ways to teach as there are teachers, and for each teacherthere are as many ways to approach teaching as there are situations in which to teach.The first axiom for any teacher, especially in a cross-cultural setting, is to adapt yourteaching to the context of the students, school and community in which you areworking. In other words, build your teaching approach in response to the conditions infront of you, and don't assume that what worked in one situation will work the same inanother. While it is useful to have a \"bag of tricks\" available to get you started, don'tassume the bag is complete continue to develop new approaches through trial-and-error on an on-going basis. 1731 85 Whenever possible, make use of local community resources (parents, elders,local leaders, etc.) and extend the classroom out into the community, to bring real-world significance to that which you are teaching (Barnhardt, 1990). To facilitate this,incorporate experientially oriented projects into your lessons and put students to workperforming everyday tasks and providing services in the community (e.g. internships,student-run enterprises, local histories, community needs assessments, etc.). Takestudents on extended field trips to cultural sites, local offices, businesses and industries.Whether in the classroom or in the field, create a congenial atmosphere that drawsstudents into the activity at hand and allows them to experience learning as a naturaleveryday activity, rather than a formality confined to the classroom. Natural settingsare more likely to foster mutually productive and culturally appropriate communicationand interaction patterns between teacher and student, than are highly structured andcontrived situations created in the confines of the classroom. To the extent that you, asa teacher, can make yourself accessible to the students, you will be that much moresuccessful in making what you teach accessible to them. This requires much patienceand a willingness to risk making mistakes along the way, but the payoff will be greatersuccess with the students in the long run.How do you determine what has been learned?The question of what constitutes success is difficult to answer under anyeducational circumstance, but it is especially complex in cross-cultural situations.Different people can exhibit competence in different ways, and when cultural differencesare added to the mix, the ways can multiply dramatically. In addition to determiningwhat it is we want students to learn, there is the task of determining how it will bemeasured, and not everything we want students to learn lends itself to easy and reliablemeasurement within the timeframe that schools expect to see results. On top of all this,we have the issue of cultural bias in everything from the instruments we use to the waywe use them.One of the most important considerations in this arena is to recognize thatthere are multiple forms and ways of applying and displaying intelligence and, therefore,we need to provide multiple avenues through which students can demonstrate theircompetence. Recent studies indicate that there are at least eight prominent forms ofintelligence, with each individual, as well as clusters of people, having strengths in someforms and weaknesses in others. These include potential aptitudes in linguistic, logical-mathematical, naturalistic, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal and.186174 intrapersonal intelligence (Gardner, 1991; Check ley, 1997). The problem is that schoolstend to rely almost exclusively on the first two (linguistic and logical-mathematical) asthe basis for measuring academic success, leaving other forms of intelligence largely onthe sidelines. While you, as a teacher, are not in a position to unilaterally revamp theschooling enterprise to more fully incorporate the full range of intelligence, you are in aposition to recognize them in your students and to provide a variety of avenues forthem to access what you are teaching. At the same time, you can incorporate some ofthe more culturally adaptive modes of assessing student performance, such asportfolios, exhibitions, demonstrations, productions, etc. Through these more flexibleand responsive approaches to assessment, it is possible to officially recognize thevarious forms of intelligence and accommodate cultural differences at the same time.What can you do in a large urban school?While some of the strategies described above may seem most appropriate forsmall rural schools with a homogenous cultural population, there are additional ways tomake large multicultural urban schools more culturally sensitive as well. One of themost culturally inhibiting factors in urban schools is size and all the impersonal andbureaucratic conditions that go along with a large-scale institution. Some of thenegative effects of size can be ameliorated within an urban setting by rethinking theway students (and thus teachers) experience the school and by viewing it more as acommunity than as an institution. For instance, a large school can be broken down intoseveral smaller \"learning communities,\" or schools-within-a-school. Students andteachers can form clusters that function as a cohesive unit with a support system basedon personalized relationships. To overcome the constraints and inefficiencies of a highlycompartmentalized schedule, classes can be organized in a block schedule format,where longer periods of time are made available for extended field trips and intensiveprojects without interfering with other classes. Through such arrangements, theeconomies-of-scale advantages of a large institution can be coupled with the flexibilityand human dimensions of a smaller school.The other area in which a potential problem can be made into an asset in anurban school is in the cultural mix of the student population. While it is not possible tofully attend to the cultural particulars of every student on a daily basis, it is possible toincorporate the rich mix of cultural backgrounds present in the classroom and schoolinto the curriculum in ways that help students learn to understand and appreciate thesimilarities and differences among themselves and their classmates. The interest and strengths of each student can be recognized and rewarded through practices such aspeer tutoring, cultural demonstrations, group projects, language comparisons, etc. Overtime, students in culturally mixed schools can learn to treat cultural differences as partof the natural fabric of society, to be celebrated and identified as a strength, rather thanas a threat. To this end, teachers in urban schools should be encouraged andsupported in their efforts to capitalize on the diversity of cultures present in theirclassrooms.SummaryWhat has been presented above is but a sampling of the strategies thatteachers may draw upon to make their classrooms inviting places for students from allcultural backgrounds and persuasions. Teachers must recognize, however, that to stophere and assume you are now ready to take on any teaching situation runs the dangerof oversimplification and misapplication of practices that are much more complex than ashort review such as this can convey.

This paperwill explore this topic in two parts. Part I of this paper will look at defining andexploring issues involved with educating the \"at risk\" student. Part II will discuss somepersonal accounts of resource programming in which both internal and externalenvironments surrounding the school have been taken into consideration in deliveringappropriate educational experiences for students in a First Nations being used more frequently to address a certainpopulation of students in our schools that fit the criteria. Students \"at risk\" have alwaysbeen in our educational system. The term is becoming more widely spread as educatorsaddress the issues surrounding these students while looking for methods andprogramming that will increase the quality of education for the \"at risk\" student.To address ways in which to meet the academic needs of \"at risk\" students, itis very important to consider all aspects of the environment that surrounds them.Children learn to establish and verify perceptions and beliefs about the world throughdirect teaching by the older people in their community, and through identification withthose people who care for them and are emotionally important to them (Bowman,1994). The prior knowledge that a student brings with them into the schoolenvironment is one of the essential tools that will determine the outcomes of theirlearning needs. Learning styles, behavior patterns and adaptation strategies that can beidentified will help determine how to program effectively in the resource area. Whenlooking at a First Nation school, it is essential to adapt curriculum that is developed byprovincial government standards to reflect the environment and culture in which it isbeing delivered.The \"at risk\" student can be defined as a student whose academic backgroundor prior performance may cause them to be perceived as candidates for future academic failure or early withdrawal (OECD, 1996). This includes students who are at risk of lowachievement in the educational system, and students not reaching their own optimalsocial and personal development. The following are some of the environmental factorsthat contribute to what students may be \"at risk\" (OECD2, 1996):1.Family Characteristicsthese may include one-parent families, large families,transient families, families with long-term illness (especially mental illness), violentand abusive families, children who lack affection, warmth and love, or familieswhich lack the resources to support education.2.Language problemsdue either to a lack of language development or poorknowledge of the language of instruction.3.Poor Community Environments characteristics include poor housing, lack of afunctioning labour market, absence of community support, inadequate leisurefacilities.Along with looking outside the school and environmental factors that lead to thedevelopment of \"at risk\" students, there are contributing factors within the school itselfthat add to the problem. A child may be developmentally competent in his or her homeenvironment, yet unable to adapt easily to a school environment or succeed at theacademic tasks valued by teachers (Bowman, 1994). When I look at resourceprogramming at our school, these critical factors must be addressed individually for eachstudent. My experiences have led me to consider the following when looking at astudent \"at risk\" within the school:1.Conflict between home and school2.Types of discipline policies within the school3.Lack of counseling services accessible to the school4.Negative perception of the school by the community5.Outdated curriculum and lack of support to initiate new curriculum6.No accountability of students' learning styles7.Non-engaging teaching strategies8.Low expectation9.Insufficient language instruction relevant to students (Hixson, 1993). It seems that traditional approaches to meeting the needs of \"at risk\" students havenot been effective in the past. This is evident when we look at the growing number of\"at risk\" students in schools today. There are four generalizations that can be made in reference to proactive approaches to assist accommodating all students in the schoolenvironment: a) redefining cultural norms of the school; b) refocusing the content,methods, and priorities of the instructional program; c) attending to thepersonal/affective needs of students and staff; and, d) establishing effectiverelationships between the school and students' homes and the broader community(Hixson & Tinzmann, 1990).From the majority of research I have looked at, interventions seem to begin withlooking at the student in a holistic manner. It is not simply enough to look at thestudent in the school environment. In order to address the issues, one has to look atthe environment surrounding that student. The community, school, family and othercontributing factors need to be included in the intervention process for a child \"at risk.\"Part II: Resource Programming for \"At Risk\" Students at a First NationsSchoolThis study is about how I have to adapt my resource program to account forcultural and language differences at our First Nations school. While working in theresource area at our school, I have found that I have had to do some adjustments tomake our programs relevant to the students' backgrounds and knowledge base.Background InformationAs there was no resource teacher in our school before I started teaching, Ifound this an excellent opportunity to implement many new programs and try new ideasfor the first time. The network between community organizations and the school werenot working in a collaborative manner. The task I was faced with included research andnetworking within the community to bring the school to a place where we were allworking toward a common goal for our \"at risk\" students.Diagnostic TestingI have found many discrepancies in diagnostic testing in the resource area.The most predominant would have to be the accountability of learning styles inacademic testing procedures. Many of the diagnostic tests that are used in determininggrade levels, academic ability, and percentile ranks don't lend themselves to a tactilelearner. Many of the students that I have tested scored poorly on these tests. But,they seem to score very well in the creative areas where visuals and manipulatives areused as measuring tools.I have one student, in particular, who amazes me when I lookat his achievements on his diagnostic testing. He scored quite low on all compositesexcept for one in the language arts area. When I read a passage to him, he could recall every detail of the passage right down to the smallest detail. He had an amazingability to recall detail in a short passage and was able to comprehend all the meaning.But, if he was to read the passage himself, he would soon get lost in fighting his waythrough the reading and the mechanics of sentence structure and, thus, lose his abilityto comprehend. For this student, he started to excel in his academic areas when westarted providing him with material that complemented his unique learning style. If wehad relied on achievement scores to determine his potential, we would never have seenthe amazing potential that this boy holds. In working with him further, I now see himas gifted, rather than a low achiever.There seems to be a definite pattern in the learning styles of the students atour school. All the students are from First Nations backgrounds. Most of the studentsthat I work with have a predominant tactile and visual learning style. What I have doneto compensate for this in the testing area is to use testing tools that center around a lotof visuals.Individualized ProgrammingThis area has been the most difficult in delivering programming to our \"at risk\"students. The majority of individualized programs I have developed are for childrenwho have low academic ability and a variety of behavior disorders. It seems thatbehavior plays a significant role in how the students will achieve academically and alsothe type of learning style they have. Often these students excel best in an environmentwhere they can use their hands and engage in an activity-based environment oflearning. These types of activities seem to help them stay focused and keep theirinterest level heightened. Their energy level and level of excitement tip the top of thescale.It seems that their physical component is moving at a faster rate than theirintellectual component. Our job in resource is to find materials that will compete withtheir heightened level of excitement. We have to somehow tie all the environmentaland academic factors together to give the students an optimum learning experience.The students with behavior disorders, that I program for, seem to experiencedifficulty in the classroom setting. There are many environmental factors thatcontribute to low achievement in the classroom setting. Working in a large groupsetting, these students seem to get quite distracted by the environment around them.The difficulty that faces First Nations Schools is that they are often left to face newchallenges in the teaching areas alone. It is apparent in this school that new curriculumis a great challenge to implement. In the new language arts curriculum, there is a great 180 deal of activity-based learning built in. This is to the \"at risk\" students' advantage.Much of the difficulty lies in the teacher. There hasn't been much in the way ofprofessional development to help teachers develop their programs to deliver this type oflearning environment. Much of the material used in the classrooms is outdated.Outside resources are not readily available to the school to bring them up to provinciallevels. It takes a very \"creative planner\" to work with limited resources. I have foundthat a large part of my job has been to work with the teachers, rather than thestudents, to set up programs in their classroom that will accommodate the manydifferent learning styles of children.The following passage is an example of working with a teacher in the languagearts area. He was very unclear on how to implement the new curriculum. Resourceswere not made available to him in the professional development area. When Imentioned the new curriculum to him, he had a look of panic on his face! He wasreluctant to learn any of the new methods and strategies. I later realized that thisreluctance was not because he did not want to learn, but, rather, was because he hadbeen teaching the same way for so many years and with lack of exposure to newerversions of the curriculum, that he was somewhat apprehensive about his abilities.Once we sorted through his feelings towards change and I gave him reassurance thathe was not alone in this, then he started becoming quite accepting of the changes, andeven looked forward to trying out new strategies and ideas in his implementation of thecurriculum..School and Community: Working with Parents in Individualized ProgrammingJ.This area of resource is probably the most challenging. There are so manyenvironmental and social issues that come into play when dealing with \"at risk\" studentsin specialized programming in our school. There is a whole cultural and communitydynamic that is part of how some students perceive the value of education through theircommunity's eyes.I will review a case scenario that will help to explain some of thedynamics regarding dealing with an \"at risk\" student. This student comes from a single-parent family with his mother being very unstable and a victim to many social disordersthat accompany the environment that she has no control over.Case Study: \"Ben\"Ben is an elementary school boy that has all the symptoms of a child with FAS.He also has speech difficulties that contribute to his low functioning. He was assessedby a psychologist and the results revealed that he is functioning as a 3 year, 2 month- 181193 aged child in most areas of development. He lacks most readiness skills and, socially,he remains at a toddler's stage in development. He has had many difficulties since hehas entered the school system. He displays such behaviors as biting, kicking, hitting,throwing objects and swearing. He shows little remorse following any incidentsinvolving hurting other students. He runs in and out of the classroom and has runoutside the building on many occasions. His attention is extremely limited, and he findsit difficult to function in a group setting. There are many difficulties in trying to assistthis child in developing a program that would accommodate some of these behaviors.His mother is very negative in her views on the school and education in general. Anytype of intervention is usually not supported by her. She has a history of confrontingthe school staff in an aggressive manner, which leads to a dysfunctional relationshipbetween the school and the home. There is a history of abuse in the family. There aremany strategies we could implement for Ben in a behavior plan, but there is no follow-through with the mother in the home setting. She is very defensive whenever I havetalked to her about Ben's behavior. If he shows problems in behavior, she blames theschool or others involved. She is very much in denial that there are serious problemswith Ben and is not equipped to deal with any of these issues.I felt I had to somehow find out why this person was so negative when itcomes to school issues.I started by arranging a visit with her in her home. When I gotto her home, she was somewhat reluctant to talk to me. I started the conversation byusing small talk and bringing some humor into the conversation. She seemed to feelmore at ease with me once she realized that I was not a threat to her and that I wasgenuine in my concerns. We didn't talk much about Ben or any school issues. I left herhome arranging another visit in a week's time.When I went back for the second visit, she had coffee ready for me. Shecalled me by my first name and was quite pleasant. She seemed to initiate theconversation telling me about some of her problems regarding her living situation. Shementioned that she is aware that there is \"something wrong with Ben,\" but did not wantto pursue that topic any further. She also disclosed that she does not like the schoolbecause they are too snoopy. I just listened to her without agreeing or disagreeing. Ifelt that any kind of communication with her was a breakthrough at this point. She toldme of some of her own school experiences. That explained a lot to me as to how sheperceives the education system. She was from a remote reserve and, at the time thatshe went to school, she had to be billeted out into a strange community to receive her 19 4182 high school credits. She ended up quitting after the first semester and going backhome. She said the white students ignored her, and the white teachers picked on her.After this conversation, I arranged another visit to talk about what we can do to helpBen. She agreed to another visit and we said our goodbyes.During the next visit, she seemed to be very willing to talk. We started to talkabout Ben. She said that other kids pick on him and that is why he behaves the way hedoes. She said that she tells Ben to fight back. She also said that she is not proud ofteaching him this, but, because this school doesn't care about the students anyway, youhave to teach your kids to stick up for themselves. Again, I listened in a non-threatening manner. I told her that we could spend some time with Ben to teach himsome ways to handle other students picking on him. I also brought up the subject ofgetting some extra help for him. She asked me if it would be me that worked with him.I felt that she had gained some trust in me by her comment. I assured her that I wouldbe involved in giving Ben the assistance that he needed. I told her that I would keep inclose contact with her when it concerns Ben. We talked about his speech problems andshe gave me permission to seek a Speech/Language Pathologist to assess him andpossibly work with him.I learned a great deal from this experience. Since I have been at this school, Ihave experienced the negative tone by the community in regards to the institution. Inow experienced first hand how that negative tone comes from the environment inwhich these students come from. This mother has a need to blame, because she is in asituation where her \"motherhood\" is in constant threat from her past experiences withabuse. It is much easier for her to blame than to accept responsibility. If she were toaccept responsibility, how very frightening that would be for her, to see the situation herlife is in.I could see the hurt in her eyes when she talked about Ben. It is no wonder,to me, that she does not want to deal with it. I felt, in this case, that we could notexpect full participation on the mother's part in all issues concerning Ben, but we didhave a line of communication that gave us a base to start with.ConclusionI think that, in order for the school to run effectively with a good line ofsupport systems, the community itself has to take responsibility for their children'seducation, especially when there are a number of risk factors that effect education. Thesocial diseases that infiltrate a community have to be addressed before the school canbecome a positive environment for the community. But these little steps we take to 183135 listen and provide support in a non-judgmental way are ways that we can make somesmall changes that do make a difference in our quest to deliver a good education.Resource programming has many challenges in this community. There is ahistory of mistrust in the education system that is very evident, even today. \"Extrahelp\" is often seen as threatening, which makes the challenge even greater. Thismistrust is validated at times when you look at some of the testing materials being usedthat are not culturally sensitive. It is also validated when some of the curriculummaterials are not relevant to First Nations communities. Again, it is also valid whenfunding and resources are not made available to First Nations schools as they are in thepublic schools. But changes are coming as seen in the new Aboriginal Resource Centerthat has just been established in Manitoba to address some of the school issues such asSpeech/Language Pathologists, Psychologists, Behavior Specialists, and other servicesthat will be provided for First Nations schools.In conclusion, it is necessary to look at all students as individuals withindividual needs and circumstances. The school needs to be a place where they accept,accommodate and respond to students in a manner that enables their maximum social,emotional and intellectual growth. As concluded from this study, one key area inachieving school success is to build community relations and work in a holistic mannerwhen dealing with \"at risk\" students. ReferencesBowman, B.

What they knew about plants they would teach to their children. A lotof the knowledge about plants has been passed on from one generation to the next.Nothing was ever recorded on paper; it was kept in the memories of people. Today,however, we have cassette recorders, movie cameras, and photographs to help uspreserve and store knowledge. The work I did with the Brandon UniVersity BotanyDepartment helped me realize the great need for resource material that can be used inthe classroom. I did two years of research interviewing different elders on theirknowledge of plants and how they are used. I realized the importance of preserving theteachings of elders so that their knowledge is not lost, and how to incorporate theirteachings into the classroom.How plants can be used in the classroom as part of the Science CurriculumResearch uses and names of local plantsHands on classroom activities using the local plantsTeach students local folklore on the plants and their originsTeach students Native rituals and practicesTeach students conservation and preservation of plantsTeach students how to survive in the woods by living off the landTeach students how to use the great outdoors for first aid supplies.Research(Grade 8) This can be modified to a lower grade:Students could interview their parents and grandparents and ask what they knowabout plants, then present their findings to the class.Plant identificationgoing on a field trip and identifying local plants. This can bedone with the help of an elder. This will help the student see what the plants looklike and where they grow. 185197 Collecting plant specimens and learning the local (Cree) name, scientific and latinname.Hands on ActivitiesCan be done in any grade level:Collecting local berries, example, Strawberries they taste great! The berriescan be made into a jam; and, note they can also be used as medicine. To the CreePeople, this berry is called Otihiminah (meaning heart medicine), Latin name is Fragariavirginiana. The berries could be picked and made into a jam. The whole plant wasused by the Cree people as a heart medicine, thus the name.Make juice the old-fashioned way Long ago, the elders didn't have Tang orKool Aid; they had a plant called Fire Weed (the English name) known in Cree asAkapuskwah, and in Latin Epilobium angustifolium. This plant can be picked and eatenif someone gets hungry. It can also be soaked in water, drained and drank as juice witha little bit of sugar added. The children will enjoy this very much. Interesting factsabout Fire Weed elders use this plant to help them determine when to hunt Moose.When the flowers are in full bloom, this tells the elders that the Moose are fat enough tohunt.Learn how plants can be used for medicines example Spruce Gum from thesap of the spruce tree. Spruce Tree Gum is known in Cree as Mistikopiki and, in Latin,as Picea mariana. The spruce tree is very common in most parts of Manitoba; the Creepeople long ago used to chew the gum for endurance. It also cleans out the stomachwhile it is being chewed. The gum was also enjoyed by children as candy. The sap canalso be made into an ointment to treat infections.Make birch bark canoes and baskets White Birch Bark, known in Cree asWaskwah; Latin name Betula papyrifera. Students can be taught that, long ago, peopleused to use bark for a number of things such as casts for a broken arm or leg. In thespring, the liquid sap was collected by placing a small stick inserted into the tree and abucket was hung to collect it. Also some elders used to use the outer bark to make tea.Birch bark baskets, canoes, and net menders can be made by using bark and branchesfrom a Red-Osier Dogwood, the Cree name is Mikobimaka (means red); Latin name isCornus stolonifera.Leaf Artleaves can be collected by the students in the fall and interesting artwork can be created. All you would need is leaves, paper, glue and some imagination. 198186 Other Classroom ActivitiesLearn local folklore about the plants and their origins from the local elders byinviting the elders into the classroom, you are using local resource people who know thearea and the stories. Example of one such story is about the \"CONK OF WOODROTTING FUNGUS\"Cree name Posakan, Latin name Inonotus obliquuus. The funguscan be found on white birch trees. This fungus can be used as a fire starter; long ago,people used to burn this fungus and carry it from camp to camp. It is said that it isalmost like coal, once it starts burning, it does not go out until it burns itself out. It canalso be boiled and made into a tea.There is a story that some elders tell about how this fungus originated; it is astory that has been passed down from one generation to the next. The Posakan is alsoknown as Wisakigak's omiki (Wisakigak is a mythic Cree character) meaning it is thescab of Wisakigak. The legend goes like this: one day Wisakigak was wandering aroundaimlessly in pain and hungry. Wisakigak is always hungry. He was so hungry he didn'tnotice that he was walking in circles. Now he had a scab on his butt (how he got thescab is another story) because he walked so much the scab fell off. So he came uponhis scab thinking, \"Oh! I found some dried meat,\" and he started yelling \"Granny!Granny! You dropped your dried meat.\" So when granny didn't answer, he ate some ofit. While he was doing this, some birds were watching him. They started laughing andteasing him, singing \"Wisakigak ate his scab! Wisakigak ate his scab!\" over and overagain. Well, this made Wisakigak very mad, so he threw it against a white birch tree;there it stayed and, today, we know it as posakan.Students can be taught to respect Native rituals. I found in my research that itis very important that respect is shown to the elder that is teaching you and to theplants being collected. Respect is shown by offering tobacco or food to the elder fortheir knowledge and time. Also, respect for the plant is shown by burying tobacco inthe spot where you are collecting. There is a saying among the elders that if you take aplant and do not offer anything in return, you will most likely have a nasty accident inyour bed during the night. Some elders say you don't have to offer tobacco, you canoffer anything such as spoons, forks, useful things. This is your way of saying Thanks.Teach students conservation and preservation ofplants (good activity forEarth Day). Students can be taught how Native people practice conservation andpreservation of plants. According to every elder that I've interviewed, they say it isimportant to respect the land; for we depend and live off it, in order for the land to 187199 continue feeding us and helping us to survive. Native people practice conservation bytaking only what they need, paying respect, and leaving the rest. A motto to teach thestudents on conservation of plants is \"take what you need, pay respect, and leavethe rest.\" To take too much would be a waste. Students can come up with their ownneat mottos to design into posters (good activity for Earth Day).Another good Earth Day activity could be planting trees around the school or inthe community. You could phone Natural Resources about trees to plant.Students can be taught how to survive in the woods using only what naturehas to provide. This could be an over-night field trip, along with an elder to show themhow to start a fire without matches, make tea, make a shelter, and find food. Studentswould enjoy this outing.Dying Clothes using the leaves of a Red-Osier Dogwood. The willow is picked,peeled and then boiled in a large bucket. You take whatever it is you want to dye andsoak it in the water. It will come out red. A little note the Red-Osier Dogwood, whenboiled, is said to be good for sore eyes and can be used as an eye drop.Make some Labrador TeaCommon Labrador Tea, known in Cree asMokopukwatikwah, Latin name Ledum groenlandicum. It can be picked, cleaned, boiledand drank as a tea. Notethis is the secret plant used by native men to preventbaldness.Teach Students to use the Outdoors for First Aid SuppliesHow to treat the following:Bee stings or insect bitestake and chew on the leaves of Poplar or AspenTrees, then apply it directly to the sting for fast relief.Fracture or broken boneuse the bark of a White Birch as a cast, wrap itaround the injured limb to prevent further injury.Upset stomachCranberries, known in Cree as Wisukimina, Latin nameVaccinium vitisidaea. The berries also clean out your stomach when eaten.Treat cuts - to treat cuts deep or small, Puff Balls, Cree name Bipogithamin,Latin name Lycoperdon, can be used. They are found in a mossy area. The Puff Ball isapplied directly to the cut.Minor cutsuse the plant Wild Lily of the Valley (Cree name Soskopukwah);the leaf is collected and dried. After it is dried, it is applied directly to the cut andwrapped with a cloth. When this plant is boiled, it is known as the Cree Iodine. 20188 HeadachesCommon Yarrow, Cree name Miskigonimaskigah (meansheadache medicine), Latin name Achillea millefolium. The flower is picked in thesummer and when someone has a headache, they just have to put the flower near yournose and the fragrance from the flower will take away the pain.Plants are so important to humans and animals; they can be used in countlessways as a teaching tool in educating students. Nature should be used, respected,admired and conserved. The research that I did for Brandon University helped me learnhow important it is to preserve the knowledge and to pass it on to others on how plantscan be used for medicine, crafts, foods, or just for admiring. There are countless waysyou can use plants in the classroom, but are too numerous to mention. I mentioned afew ways you could use plants in the classroom. What I learned as most important is touse the local elders and people in the community as your resources. Bring them intothe classroom; it takes more than one person to educate a child. This research I foundwas very valuable in preserving the knowledge of the Nisichiwasihk First Nation Elders(Nelson House) and I thank them for helping expand my knowledge of plants. 201189 The Preservation of Traditional Plant Lore Robin J. Mar les IntroductionCanada's boreal forest has been, for a long time, a very important source ofnatural resources. Originally, it was important for subsistence activities such as huntingmeat and gathering foods such as fruit, vegetables, and beverage plants, medicinalplants, and materials for technology and rituals. More recently, northern naturalresources have been harvested for economic purposes. This started with snaring andtrapping for the fur trade and then logging, which focused originally on softwoods suchas white spruce, but now encompasses hardwoods such as aspen too. As economicexploitation of the northern forest expands, serious questions have arisen as to thesustainability of these industries.Perceptions of the Boreal ForestSustainability was not considered an issue in the past, due to the perceptionthat the boreal forest was an almost endless expanse of trees and muskeg. Indeed, halfof Canada is covered by forests, representing 10% of the entire world's forests.However, Canada harvests close to one million hectares of forest per year, which couldbe compared to Brazil's deforestation rate of 1.4 million hectares per year. Most of thesouthern boreal forest is already subject to forest tenures held by private companies forlogging, and the northern half is labelled on this map from the publication \"The State ofCanada's Environment\" as the \"non-productive boreal forest.\"The federal and provincial Forest Services and forest industry are now lookingfor ways to diversify the forest industry, including the gathering of \"non-timber forestproducts.\" These non-timber forest plants can benefit Canadian agriculture too, throughcrop diversification such as the cultivation of ginseng, a forest species, under shadestructures. Farm diversification is an essential strategy to reverse the high rate of farmbankruptcies, which have increased 1000% over the last 20 years, especially (70%) onthe prairies.202190 The Human FactorFirst Nations peoples living in northern Canada possess a wealth of knowledgeabout edible plants growing there. There are both humanitarian and financial reasonswhy we should learn from them. The ultimate humanitarian goal of the Functional FoodIndustry is to help consumers achieve and maintain good health. Good health dependson the interaction between four key factors:Clean waterA healthy lifestyleProper nutritionAdequate professional health careMany northern communities are accessible only by poor roads or just ice roadsin winter, boats in summer, or air year-round. Isolation may result in a lack ofemployment opportunities and unequal access to health care. Poverty and despair arekey factors in the poor sanitation facilities affecting water quality, social disruptionaffecting lifestyle, and improper eating habits leading to malnutrition.Government-sponsored attempts to solve the problems of poor eating habitsand malnutrition have included several approaches:Flying in produce from southern communities, which results in high costs toconsumers and low quality of produce due to extended shipping and handling;Introducing small-scale agriculture, kitchen gardens and greenhouses, which maybe difficult to establish and maintain in remote communities, and which may alsofail because inhabitants have no tradition of, nor interest in, agriculture;Education based on a paradigm foreign to aboriginal culture;Inadequate communication with northern residents as to what types of assistancethey desire may predestine many aid ventures to failure.Importation of food and introduction of agriculture into the north have been theonly practical solutions enacted to date in part due to the perception of non-residentsthat local natural resources are inadequate. The boreal forest is perceived as a vastexpanse of dark forest and muskeg frozen for more than half of the year while thesurrounding grounds are perceived as being \"barren.\" Primary biological productivity isindeed lower in the north than in other regions of Canada but, nevertheless, the landsupports a diverse flora and fauna. First Nations peoples have lived well off theseresources for thousands of years. 203191 Official government maps label much of the north as \"non-productive\" borealforest. Much of the \"productive\" boreal forest is already subject to forest tenuresgranted to private companies for logging. Questions regarding long-term sustainabilityof current forest industry practices have led to increasing interest in \"non-timber forestresources\" as a means for forest industry diversification. There is also some potentialfor agricultural diversification through cultivation of northern plants, with specialtechniques, if necessary, such as providing shade for forest species like Americanginseng. Diversification of the forest and farm industries will provide greater economicstability to these two pillars of the Canadian economy, and the participation of thenorthern First Nations peoples in functional food and phytochemical nutraceutical cropdevelopment will create greater economic opportunities for their communities.Boreal EthnobotanyThe best source of information on potentially useful native plants is theknowledge of First Nations elders, who have a long tradition of plant use. With theeconomic justification of diversification of the forestry and agricultural industries,funding was obtained from the Canadian Forest Service to conduct extensiveethnobotanical field research across the central boreal forest region. A key aspect ofthis research is that it has involved First Nations communities in every stage, fromplanning to conducting field interviews, collecting and identifying plant specimens, andanalyzing the results. The information to follow is based on interviews with over 100Cree, Dene, and Metis elders in 29 different communities across the north.Traditional Uses for Plants in a Modern ContextInformation was gathered on many aspects of the relationship between theFirst Nations peoples and their plant environment.Technological uses include the use of birch bark to construct baskets, moosecallers, and many other implements. Birch wood was carved and shaped to makesnowshoe frames.Food plants include many types of fruit such as cloudberries, blueberries, andcranberries, shoots of cattails, bulrushes, and reeds, and the inner bark of birch, aspenand pine. One \"modern\" buzzword is \"Functional Food,\" the definition of which isadopted from the Health Canada Discussion Document on Functional Foods andNutraceuticals (1997). Characteristics of a Functional Food:Similar in appearance to conventional foodsConsumed as a part of a usual diet 204192 Demonstrated to have physiological benefits beyond basic nutritional functions, orReduces the risk of chronic diseaseFirst Nations elders have long explicitly recognized the connection betweenconsumption of bush food and the maintenance of good health, so this is not a newconcept to them. One example of a \"functional food\" from Canada's north is thecranberry, known to treat or help prevent urinary tract infections due to its content offructose and other high-molecular-weight compounds that prevent bacteria fromadhering to the urinary tract epithelium.Another modern buzzword is \"nutraceutical,\" which is defined by the HealthCanada Discussion Document on Function Foods and Nutraceuticals (1997), as havingthe following distinguishing characteristics:Produced from a foodSold in pills, powders or other medicinal formsDemonstrated physiological benefits beyond basic nutritional functions, orReduces the risk of chronic diseaseMost traditional foods do not fit in this category, with the possible exception of mineralsalts extracted from red samphire by boiling and evaporation, and used by the ShoalLake, SK, Cree to season food. This basic salt would provide trace minerals which actas enzyme co-factors critical for the maintenance of good health. Consumption of smallamounts of chromium, manganese, and magnesium salts has been shown to bebeneficial in the treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.There are many classes of \"nutraceutical\" compounds in traditional bush foodswith known health benefits. The presence of these types of compounds in traditionalfruits (e.g. blueberries), roots (e.g. cattail rhizomes), and shoots (e.g. fireweed) makesthese foods \"functional.\" These compounds are often present in higher amounts in wildplants than in cultivated species which have been bred for mild flavour, e.g. carotenoidsand xanthophylls are readily visible in wild vegetable leaves such as fireweed after lossof the chlorophyll.Commercialization has already occurred for some nutraceuticals such a proanthocyanidin complex reputedly antioxidant and reducing bloodcapillary fragility.\"Cosmeceuticals\" are compounds present in cosmetics which have apharmaceutical effect, such as to improve skin texture, stimulate wound healing, controlhair growth, regulate skin pigmentation, reduce inflammation, or reduce irritation, e.g. 193205 stinging, burning, and itching. Examples of plants with cosmeceutical potential includeyarrow which contains anti-inflammatory terpenoids and fireweed underdevelopment an anti-inflammatory due to itsflavonoid glycoside content.Pharmaceuticals have an excellent track record for economic development:over three-quarters of the more than 120 plant-derived drugs currently on the marketwere discovered through scientific investigation of traditional uses. Estimates of thecurrent North American market value for natural products varies from $5 billion to $250billion, depending on how strictly these products are defined. More than 130 native ornaturalized species of plants were identified in our study as having traditional medicinaluses.Medicinal plants are often used in combinations, but the elders have asked usto keep the formulas confidential to protect their intellectual property rights. We havetheir permission to describe and evaluate uses of certain individual plants in order tovalidate traditional knowledge. For example, rat root, Acorus americanus (Raf.) Raf.,Acoraceae, rhizome for colds, upset stomach, (rheumatism, head, etc.), yellow pond lily, Nuphar lutea (L.) Nymphaeaceae, arthritis, childbirth recovery. Bearberry or Uva Ursi is now beingsold as a registered diuretic drug (despite the red maple leaf on the label, it is importedfrom the US), in a new drug class known as \"Traditional Herbal Medicines.\"Health Canada established this separate category of non-prescription drugs forthe marketing of products often previously sold as dietary supplements, but for whichthere are references supporting therapeutic use. Key aspects of the definition of aTraditional Herbal Medicine are:Finished drug productsIntended for self-medicationIntended for minor self-limiting ailments suitable for self-treatmentActive ingredients are herbalLimited scientific documentationWell-documented traditional useSustainabilityNow that we have identified a significant number of potentially useful plantsfrom the boreal forest, we must determine if they can be developed in a sustainable 206194 manner. Sustainable development should be viewed as an ecological, economic, andcultural concept.Ecological SustainabilityMost ecologists would agree that large-scale clear-cut logging is notecologically sustainable. Alternative strategies such as selective logging, combined withthe harvest of non-timber forest products, could allow the same economic return perhectare with fewer trees cut, making the industry more sustainable. Conversely (orperhaps I should say perversely), some companies are sending in gatherers for the non-timber products and then clear-cutting, which maximizes the dollars extracted perhectare, but is less ecologically sustainable. Information can always be used for eithergood or bad purposes. Most non-timber native plants, such as senega snakeroot,cannot be sustainably wildcrafted due to the quantities needed for commerce and, inmany localities, particular species have already become endangered or extirpated.Although biological productivity in the north is relatively low, small-scaleagriculture with ameliorative techniques such as raised beds or cold-frames can provesuccessful. Developing native species into new crops presents a unique set ofagronomic challenges for cultivation, pest control, harvesting, and preparation formarket but, for many of our economic native plants, selection of appropriate varietiesand large-scale agricultural production will be the most viable option for a sustainableharvest.Economic SustainabilityWith respect to economic sustainability, Canada has a long history as a majorsupplier to the world of raw materials, which we export and then buy back as finishedproducts. This trend has carried over into medicinal plant crops such as ginseng, whichis sold in bulk through brokers to Asian markets. Much more effort must be made todevelop value-added products, particularly if rural communities are to achieve themaximum benefit from new medicinal crops. Target markets must be clearly identifiedand stringent quality controls established to ensure commercial viability.Cultural SustainabilityRegarding cultural sustainability, development should be consistent with localcommunity needs and desires, not just demands of the global market. Amongaboriginal people of all ages participating in this study, there was no consensus on thedesirability of economic development of plant products. Concern was expressed thatpharmaceutical companies might profit from the development of medicines based on 195207 traditional remedies without any recognition or financial compensation for thoseproviding the information, raising the issue of protection of intellectual property rights.These issues must be dealt with fairly to ensure sustained involvement of thecommunity in development projects. Direct involvement of community members in theresearch and development process empowers them to find the solutions they need.Involving aboriginal youth in the research helps to disseminate traditional knowledge,ensuring that these traditions will be sustained from one generation to the next.ConclusionsIn conclusion, the team-work approach of aboriginal researchers, communityelders, scientists, foresters, agronomists, and marketers for the discovery andassessment of potential new plant products promises to be a successful paradigm fornorthern economic development. However, much work remains to turn our well-intentioned dreams of commercial boreal medicinal plant products into a trulysustainable reality. We need to listen to the \"Voice of the Drum,\" that is, listen to theknowledge of the elders to learn how best to handle the potential of traditionally usedplants to help people today.

Ross IntroductionAny issue in a First Nations community is likely to be somewhat different thanthat of the general Canadian population. Important differences arise from the historicalexperience of the First Nations people. First Nations people have been subjected to acommon colonial experience. They have experienced such things as loss of viableeconomic activity, loss of language and culture, loss of self-government, the residentialschool experience, the experience of a reservation life, poverty and racism. FirstNations communities are also unique in that they are serviced differently in health andeducation than any other Canadian community. Our schools have failed to nurture theintellectual development and academic performance of many First Nations children, asevident from their school dropout rates and negative attitudes towards school (IndianNations at Risk Task Force Report, 1991).Our First Nations students are straddling between the world of tradition andthat of economics, which is fast-paced, competitive and a forever-changingenvironment. The exterior powerful forces send conflicting messages to these students.Thus, they are caught up with the negative forces that prevent them from getting thatintellectual development and academic learning. Before any successful school changecan happen, an attempt has to be made to address the historical experiences mentionedabove.Historical Shifts in EducationPrior to European contact, traditional Indian Education in Manitoba, as amongall Indian Bands or groups across Canada, was an all-encompassing life-long processand was integrated into the social and political structure of Indian communities. Thefunction of traditional education was to pass on knowledge from one generation to thenext to ensure cultural continuity. Training for boys and girls in preparation for212200 adulthood was very important. They were provided with the life skills necessary fortheir future roles in society as well-prepared, self-sustaining persons who couldcontribute to the life of the family, the band, and the nation. During this period ofhistory of Indian Education in the traditional economic region, which is now Manitoba,the training of Indian children was designed, planned and implemented by Indianleaders, elders and parents in preparing their children for the environment in which theywere to live.When vigorous missionary activity began in what is now Manitoba, in aroundthe year 1812, the traditional Indian system of learning began to experience a radicalexternal challenge. Early missionaries served as settlement government factors wherelaws and political legislation did not have a strong influence. Besides having a centralcommunication role in early settlements, the missionaries' vision for educating theIndian was based on Christianity as the only road to \"civilization.\" For the most part,instruction was conducted in the Indian community. Indian parents were still able toresist the externally imposed and culturally biased education of their children. Theycontinued to influence their children through language and culture.In 1867, The British Parliament adopted the British North American Act (BNA)giving the Canadian Parliament the authority for self-government. In Section 9 of theBNA, the Federal Government of Canada was assigned the responsibility for Indians andIndian lands. The Indian Act defined the administrative relationship between theFederal Government and the Indian people. Treaty 5, affecting northern Manitoba andother treaties, which were subsequently signed with Indians of Manitoba and WesternCanada, committed the Federal Government to provide educational services andfacilities on reserves. The terms of the treaties constitute what the Indians consideredas a binding and inviolable statutory commitment by the Federal Government to provideuniversal free education to Indian people. The Federal Government chose to continueto delegate the responsibility for Indian Education to the missionaries and churches.In order to combat the resistance the Indian parents and children made to thisassimilation, the Federal Government made a serious and vigorous attempt to absorbthe Indian child into the mainstream's perception of life. This was done throughremoving Indian children from their home environment and parental influence byplacing them in Industrial Schools, the forerunners of Residential Schools, for tenmonths of the year. This practice lasted for over fifty years and most seriously eroded 201 parental control of education, and had many devastating repercussions for the Indianfamily structure.The curriculum of early Industrial Schools in Manitoba and across Canada wasinfluenced by the American Industrial School System, which was based on a half-dayplan. The first half-day was devoted to academics and the second half-day on industrialtraining since relative economic self-sufficiency of the school was stressed. TheIndustrial Schools were eventually replaced by Residential Schools after a Federalgovernment Order-in-Council in 1892.Residential Schools followed the philosophy and operation of IndustrialSchools. Their principal purpose was to isolate the students from their environments soas to reduce cultural and parental influences and to assimilate the Indian child into theCanadian homogeneous concepts. The hardships encountered by students on Industrialand Residential Schools have already been solidly documented, ranging from emotionalisolation, high incidences of epidemics, strict discipline and punishment, especiallyregarding the prohibition of speaking the native language, and sexual abuse. It shouldbe noted that, although many Indian children attended Industrial and ResidentialSchools, such educational practices were not universal and the operation of Indian dayschools on reserves persisted during this era.Most Recent Education SystemGenerally, Indians in Manitoba attended three different types of schoolsystems: Federal, Provincial, and Band-operated schools. From among these schoolsystems, it is clear that there were wide disparities in resources and wide variations inthe quality of programming, community supports and student performance. Thefollowing depressing evidence is, in large measure, due to outside control, geographicisolation, effects of cultural assimilation, and limited education programs affording theneeds of Indian students:More than 97 percent do not graduate and are slotted into a lifetime ofpoverty.Dropout rates rise significantly after elementary school, and did not show anymarked decrease since 1978.Over 90 percent of pupils attending northern Manitoba reserves come fromhomes where English is the second language and there are no mechanismsthat specifically address the language needs of Indian children attending theseschools. In spite of the continuing absence of adapted school programs that214202 meet Indian cultural needs, the Federal Government has made a strongcommitment to language programs for Anglophones, Francophones and recentimmigrants.Native Studies, or the support of cultural identity, through the native language,legends, arts, and community activities, rest upon the efforts of few individualteachers who receive few, if any, supports.Inadequate manpower on northern reserves cannot manage an Indianeducational system with its own unique needs; elders and other eminent localresources are removed from the Indian children's educational systems, andlocal teachers do not have the authority to employ them.Cross Lake Community ProfileCross Lake is located approximately 520 air kilometres north of Winnipeg alongthe shores of the Nelson River, and 130 air kilometres south of Thompson. Thecommunity consists of the Community Council (non-status/Metis) and the Cross LakeFirst Nation (status). Cross Lake First Nation Reservation is one of the fastest growingprogressive reservations in Manitoba. Cross Lake has had a significant populationincrease and has the largest youth population in all the 63 First Nations in Manitoba.Cross Lake Education Authority's school teaching staff is 80% Aboriginal. Cross Lake isalso in the process of establishing a regionalized campus with Keewatin CommunityCollege offering various community-based programs. Cross Lake First Nation is asignatory to Treaty 5 signed in 1875. The language of the people is Cree. Cross LakeFirst Nation is one of the five bands covered by the provision of the Northern FloodAgreement. Cross Lake First Nation Reservation has been devastated by the ManitobaHydro's Jenpeg Power Dam and Lake Winnipeg Control Structure located 15 kilometresupstream from the reserve. The population of the Cross Lake on-reserve isapproximately 3,483 and the total population including off-reserve is 5,255.For the community services, Cross Lake First Nation has its own firedepartment and police protection; Cross Lake has the R.C.M.P. detachment with fiveofficers and five First Nations constables. Health care services are also available; CrossLake Nursing Station has 5-6 nurses and three doctors on rotation. Dental care is alsoavailable all year round. The nearest hospital is Thompson General Hospital.The infrastructure of the Cross Lake First Nation community is not lacking.Electrical service is provided by landline from the Jenpeg Power Dam. For water supply,part of the community is serviced by main line piping and the rest by holding tanks. 203215 The Cross Lake First Nation community is accessible by land and air. There aretwo daily flights to Cross Lake from Winnipeg. There are also two flights from CrossLake to Thompson. There is an all-weather road from Provincial Road No. 373 with oneshort ferry/winter road crossing at Pipestone Lake. The Grey Goose Bus lines also makesa daily run to Cross Lake. Most of the community roads are paved.The resource, economic and employment development of the Cross Lake FirstNation community varies. The three main traditional lifestyles were trapping, huntingand commercial fishing. The Cross Lake First Nation and Cross Lake Education Authorityare the largest employers.Cross Lake First Nation has their own communications systems; they operate alocal radio station, C.F.N.C., and a 16 Multichannel Television Station is in place forcable subscription. Full telephone service has been in place for the last decade. Thecommercial business and services of the community have been very progressive. Manyof the local community members have their own businesses as in a local airline, hairsalon, restaurants, gas stations, plumbing and electrical services, to name a few. Thetwo major stores are I.G.A. and the Northern Store. There are two restaurants and onemotel. There are other services, too numerous to mention.Cross Lake Education AuthorityA.Philosophy of Cross Lake Education AuthorityThe philosophy of the Cross Lake Education Authority is that education is ablend of culture, tradition and technology. Education is an on-going process whichbegins with the parents and, later, school programs are an extension of this family-shared education. Our children are educated so that, through respect for personalfreedom, they will learn all they need to know in order to be active participants of theirworld and to lead a good life. Strength, wisdom, courage, and vision results in:Pride in one's selfUnderstanding one's fellow-personsLiving in harmony with natureOur education must respect and encompass our language, our history, our land, natureand all our resources. Our school must be holistic and realistic in outlook. It mustrelate not only to academic development, but also our spiritual, emotional, mental, andphysical growth. All activities of the school should be determined in the light of howthey affect the child's education and training.216204 B.SchoolsCross Lake Education Authority is very large and a more complex organization.As per school board direction, the two schools Otter Nelson River School and MikisewMiddle Schoolhave to operate under the same policies of the Cross Lake EducationAuthority. Otter Nelson River School offers K-4 and Senior I to Senior IV, and MikisewMiddle School from 5-8. Each school operates with its own administration. Otter NelsonRiver School has 62 staff members: three administrators, teachers and other supportstaff. At Mikisew Middle School, there are 35 staff members: two administrators,teachers and other support staff.C.Vision Statement of Cross Lake Education SchoolsThe vision statement of Cross Lake Education Authority schools reads:The Cross Lake Education Authority believes all community members have theright to the highest quality of education.It is their mandate to provide a culturally relevant education in a safe, caringenvironment which will enable students to acquire the necessary skills to meetthe challenges of life and make a positive contribution to society.D.Goals of Cross Lake Education Authority SchoolsProvide a safe learning and teaching environment for students and staff.Provide an educational environment that will enable all students to develop theacademic skills and apply them to everyday challenges.Promote communication, teamwork and support between the home, schooland community.Promotion of emotional well-being of students and staff to ensure a positivelearning environment is achieved.The vision statement was developed by the school staff and some parents.\"Vision is defined as an agreement, explicitly stated in some form, shared by asignificant number of participants in an organizational unit, on a mixture of values,beliefs, purposes, and goals that serves to provide a clear reference point for membersof the organizational unit to use when making decisions about their behaviour in theorganizational context. This vision must be clear enough to enable participants to makechoices that help move the organization toward achievement of the general values,beliefs, purposes, or goals\" (Conley, 1997, p. 427). The staff and parents sat togetherto readdress the \"vision statement\" and \"goals.\"217205 Organizational Staff/TeamThe organization of the Cross Lake Education Authority is led by the sevenmember school board who are elected at staggered elections every two years. The twoschools are unique in their own way, as the majority of each school staff is Aboriginaland there is a focus of implementing culturally relevant programs. In a recent review ofCross Lake Education Authority staff, 80% are Aboriginal and are qualified teachers.The parental involvement in the schools is great, and both schools like toreceive parents at all times. In the last several years, the parents of the communityhave become more involved and responsible for school developments.The other component of the school organization is the involvement of theelders. Elders can be part of the school organization and certainly both schools havewelcomed the elders. The elders have to be reconnected to the younger generation ofthe community. The younger generation needs to hear the stories of their peoples'histories.A.Parents and Community InvolvementNo school is likely to be successful without the inclusion of the parents andcommunity. Otter Nelson River School has been fortunate to have the on-goingparticipation and support from the parents and community resource people. Increasedinvolvement of parents and community is often cited as one of the most important waysto improve public schools. A number of studies (Henderson & Berta, 1994) confirm thatparent involvement makes an enormous impact on students' attitudes, attendance andacademic achievement.Corner and Haynes (1992) describe five guiding principles for involving parentsin schools.1.A no-fault approach, focusing not on who is to blame, but on what can bedone.2.Co-ordination and co-operation among all adults concerned with the child'sbest educational interests.3.Decision by consensus whenever possible.4.Regular meetings representing the entire school community.5.Active involvement of parents.These guiding principles are precise and more appropriate for the development of asuccessful school, and I would recommend that these guiding principles be followed. 206 As parents and community members, one of the greatest responsibilities wehave is to educate our children. As the proverb goes, \"it takes an entire village to raisea child.\" Perhaps there is no greater duty for the village than to make sure its childrengain the knowledge, skills and confidence to succeed as adults and contribute to theircommunity. It surprised me to find this proverb, as it is the same proverb of the FirstNations people. Yet, the parents and community have little control of how their childrenare educated. Parents and communities are not given the tools or the authority to makedecisions to make sure their children are succeeding in schools. Power and control overthe education of the children rests in government policies. Changes need to be made toput the power back into the hands of parents, school boards, and classroom teachers.Trust needs to be put back into the \"village,\" empowering the parents andcommunities to decide what is best for their children's education we need to trust theparents. We need to restore some common sense to our education system, and thatbegins with returning power to parents and communities. We need to return power tothe village, so its people can properly raise their children (Thompson, 1995).B.Role of EldersThe elders are the completion of the life cycle displayed in the medicine wheel.The elders have always played a central role in First Nations education. Elders are thekeepers of tradition, guardians of culture, the wisdom keepers, and the teachers. Eldersare highly respected in the First Nations circles.The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples Report (1996) states that:Elders be reinstated to an active role in the education of Aboriginal childrenand youth in education systems under Aboriginal control and in provincial andterritorial schools.Provincial and territorial education ministries, boards of education andeducators recognize the value of elders' and peoples' understanding of theuniverse by:collaborating with elders to determine how traditional Aboriginal knowledge canbe made accessible in the education of all students, whether Aboriginalinstitutions are under Aboriginal, provincial or territorial control (p. 525).Key Characteristics of the SchoolsCross Lake Education Authority schools have made headway in their educationsystem. They have implemented many unique programs in their school organization.Some of the key characteristics of the schools are: 207219 as stated earlier, there are a large number of Aboriginal teachers. Not only aremany of the teaching staff Aboriginal, these teachers are fully qualified andsome are trained in specialized areas: home economics, industrial arts,computers, special education, counselling, administration and early years;the school and community still maintain their language and the children in theschools are fluent in their Cree Language;the school offers cultural programming as in teaching the Cree Language andFirst Nations Studies from pre-school to senior years. Five staff persons workin the area of cultural programming;a mature student program is in place to welcome those students who havedropped out of school and are prepared to re-enter school;a co-operative program is offered to meet the needs of the students who areacademically delayed as a result of certain social conditions, but still want to beeducated. The program also includes work experience with communitybusinesses;A Wilderness Camp is incorporated into the outdoor education. First NationsStudies and Science programs are in place and the students are transported tothis camp and some classes camp out there;the governance system of the community, which is Chief and Council, workseffectively with the Cross Lake Education Authority School Board. These twoorganizations have established a clear understanding and mutual respectbetween them; andthe school organizations are non-unionized; our leadership believes that unionshave no place in local band governments.In-school and Community ProgramsA.First Nations Language ProgramIn 1971, the Manitoba Native Bilingual Program was developed in Manitoba.Five communities were involved in the program. The five communities were NelsonHouse, Wasagamach, St. Theresa Point, Pelican Rapids, and Cross Lake. Before the1970's, a survey was conducted and showed that 50% of the Native children enteringschool in Manitoba knew their Native language. It was about that time when the Nativepeople began the movement of taking control of their education.Cross Lake led the way in the Native language education and many othercommunities modelled their programs after the Manitoba Native Bilingual Program. The2 0208 community was involved: the elders telling the stories, artists doing the illustrations ofthe teaching aids, and parents assisting the teachers. It was absolutely necessary foreveryone to know about the program. Everyone was informed about the (1)background, (2) the rationale, and (3) the objectives. The program needed all thesupport. The program promoted the need for training Native teachers. The success ofthe program rests on the teachers; every teacher must support the program. It wasimportant to know that knowing your own language first means that you are morereadily able to learn the second language. This has been proven by research. It is afact that the best way to teach anyone to learn a second language is to start children intheir own language first. After starting children in their own language, English shouldbe gradually introduced to them. It was a fact that many children came to school withthe knowledge of their own language and, upon encountering a non-Native teacher,they were immediately alienated from the classroom. The children became frustrated.This was even more evident when children of five or six years entered school.The emphasis of the progrthn is the language and culture. Because languageis the basis of a culture, losing a language is to lose one's culture. Many Nativelanguages across the country are at the verge of extinction. In Cross Lake, the bilingualprogram was implemented in the school, and it was found that the children's attendancewas then better. Having Native teachers in the school made the students morecomfortable. The teachers knew the children's community, the culture, and values ofthe people. When children came to pre-school, they were so busy learning the Englishlanguage that all other learning was- stifled.A program was developed to teach English as a second language fromkindergarten to the third grade. In.Kindergarten I 80-100% of the Native languagewas taught with 0-20% of English being taught; Kindergarten II - 60-80% Nativelanguage and 20-40% Nativelanguage and 80%-100% English. This rationale was set up to design a language shift.The shift is from the Native language to English.This program was in the school for ten years and was lost after some parentsand teachers felt that the teaching of the language was not that important. However,the results had been evident for there had been an increasing number of high schoolgraduates. The students were highly fluent in their language and other non-Nativestudents who attended our school learned to speak the language. Today, we have one 209 non-Native teacher who has grown up in Cross Lake and went through the program.She used it in teaching the primary grades and is very fluent in our language. She canrelate to her students and knows her students' background.B.First Nations Studies ProgramIn September 1990, the First Nations Studies Program was implemented fromGrades 110. The Native Studies Program was planned by the teachers involved.After a year of the program, there was a change in the teachers. Again, the programwas planned by the teachers involved. It was not until January 1992 that a consultantwas hired on a contract basis to work with the First Nations Studies ProgramCommittee. The Committee was composed of elders, parents, school board, schooladministration, teachers and board administration. The main objective was to develop aFirst Nations Studies Program from pre-school to senior years and:to teach our children to revere the culture of their parents, grandparents andancestorsto transmit, preserve and strengthen the children's identitiesto open children's minds to new worlds, new ideas, new responsibilities whichcould build a bridge to the other societies of the worldto instil in our children the shared, not separate, culturesThe Program is to:create an awareness of the First Nations' issuesteach the historical content of the First Nations peoples and treatiesconvey to the children the knowledge, skills and the language that will givethem a broader understanding of the world and themselvescorrect the systematic defamation which has distorted, denied and deformedthe truth of the children's cultural and historical realityrecommend the culturally appropriate tests and library booksIn keeping with the Manitoba Department of Education and Training Directivethat the teachers have the prerogative of using 12 weeks or 30% of classroom allottedtime to give greater emphasis to certain units or to choose other related topics, the FirstNations Studies Program Committee decided that K 8 levels of study be units of studywith the present social studies curriculum.To match content areas with topic areas, the following topics were decidedupon: 222210 GradeCross Lake Department of Education KCree Legends and Story Telling, Exploring my World, Concept of SelfFamily and Self-Concept 1Cree Legends and Story Telling Human Needs and HumanInterdependence 2Woodlands First Nations: Past & ChangesPresent 3Cross Lake, Community Profile Communities Today 4First Nations Traditions and Communities Around the WorldContributions 5First Nations of Manitoba Life in Canada Today 6Treaty 5, Indian Act Life in Canada's Past 7Economic Development & First Spaceship EarthNations CommunitiesFirst Nations of Canada before 1492 People Through the AgesIt was determined that Grade 9, 10, 11 and 12 subjects be school-initiatedsubjects; therefore, 10G, 21G, 31G, and 41G levels. It was also recommended that aselection, if not all of the subjects, become compulsory requirements for graduation.Since the Province of Manitoba, Department of Education and Training, has determinedthat the Senior IV class will require a minimum of 28 credits for graduation, the localEducation Authority has made a decision to make the number of credits required forgraduation greater by including some First Nations subjects.

The First Nationshave been noted to be storytellers. Storytelling has always been emphasized andeverything was passed on from generation to generation orally as an integral part oflearning. Through legends or stories, the children could learn about the world aroundthem and how to live. The stories teach the children how to become real people in theirreal worldthat they have to feel love, respect, and trust to know the joy of caring andsharing and be willing to help one another. When these feelings become an integralpart of a person, he or she can then understand his or her purpose for being there andbecome a real person.The stories tell about the world and why certain things and animals are theway they are; for example, how the loon walks the way he/she does. The stories arevery amusing and fun for children; they also teach certain behaviour. Another exampleis a legend that teaches about disobeying one's elders and honesty. Most of thesestories have a purpose and message. When the elders speak to the children, thechildren are interested and will listen.C.Kisipanakak Wilderness Outdoor Education CampKisipanakak Wilderness Camp is situated at the end of Cross Lake Reserve, 12miles southwest of the community on the Nelson River en route to Jen Peg. AtKisipanakak, at one time, around the 1940's and 1950's, the people of Cross Lake had aCo-op reserve garden. When they were looking for an ideal location to build theWilderness Camp, Kisipanakak was the selected site. The Kisipanakak Wilderness Campwas constructed in the summer of 1995. The building was constructed under one of thearticles of the Northern Flood Agreement Schedule CCross Lake CommunityTrap line(RTL) Registered Trap line License 56. The building is over 4,728 square feet.The building contains two sleeping quarters; one each for males and females. Thecamp can accommodate thirty-six persons. The camp is fully equipped with a kitchenfacility and a large common room area. The building is heated by propane and a woodburning stove. There is no radio, telephone or television to distract your peace of mind.The place is well isolated, accessed only by boat in the summer, and by skidoo orbombardier in the winter.The scenery is marvellous as only mother nature can provide such beauty. Thesun, sky, water, trees, grass, flowers, and land all take part in the formation of differentdelightful sceneries. The sun is a welcoming sight in the early part of the morning; thesky clear or with it's different formation of cloud clusters seems to beckon you to enjoy 224212 the tranquillity of the wilderness; and the glimpses of fascinating rainbows in the skyseem to remind you of our Creator's promises to be near you forever if we allow Him.The sounds of nature are like a song contributed by all the birds, trees, wind, and thelapping of the waves. You cannot but enjoy and relax in such an immense relaxingatmosphere. At this place, you are away from stress, away from your everyday worriesand problems of each day's routine. You take the time to breathe in all the fresh airthat is available, without worrying about breathing in some environmental pollution.Even when it rains, the dancing raindrops that trickle down the side of the roof are awelcoming sound to your ears. This is a place where a person will be able to enjoy thequietness and capture the freedom of living in the wilderness.Goals of Kisipanakak Wilderness Campprovide students with incentives to gain more interest in the preservation andconservation of the available natural resources in their surroundings.have students appreciate and value the traditional lifestyle of people before us,so that we may experience these values by keeping contact with the outdoorlife.provide opportunities for all students to learn and apply all the necessary skills,methods, and techniques for all seasonal, commercial, recreational activitieslike fishing, hunting, and trapping.give participants the opportunity to experience the methods of trapping,fishing, and hunting, keeping in mind all laws and regulations regarding theseactivities.utilize local and community resource people to share their wealth ofknowledge, understanding, and expertise in each significant area of outdooreducation.allow students and participants to express personal growth, imagination, andcreativity, and the development of social skills.allows the participants to learn and apply basic life and survival skills requiredfor the outdoors.have students share and work together for a better and brighter future.provide students with an opportunity to develop self-pride in their personalgrowth and development.provide students with an opportunity to give ideas about their own intereststhat would benefit them the most. 213225 provide students with an opportunity to get a sense of belonging and pridefrom getting in close contact with nature, and to catch a glimpse of theirgrandparents' way of life, experiencing the freedom of living in the wilderness.allow participants to utilize and apply safety skills through planned outdooreducational activities.allow students to participate in leisurely and entertaining activities, to allowthem creative expression and sharing in a natural setting.provide the opportunity for incorporating activities that promote the values to:share, love, show respect for self and others, be honest, have courage, behumble, and have pride in self.to provide information of the causes and effects of drugs and alcohol abuse.ProgrammingThe classes of students involved in the Wilderness Camp are Grades 5 8 fromMikisew School, and senior years from Otter Nelson River School. Each teacher isresponsible for his/her class who works directly with the students, with the aid ofparents as chaperons and elders as traditional teachers. The goals and objectivesoriginate from the list of purposes. It is highly recommended that each trip be carefullyplanned for each day with the academic, and life-skills, needs reflected in the planning,keeping in mind the expectations of both the students and the instructors. With thehelp of the Outdoor Education Co-ordinator, each teacher plans with the resourcepeople available for the trip, and students.Planning and PreparationThis program is in operation from September to June each year with theexception of holidays throughout the school year. If possible, a yearly schedule isdrawn out so that each class from senior years has a chance to experience and utilizethe wilderness camp facilities and program. The schedule is drawn up early inSeptember, as soon as the teachers have had their administrative or orientation days.The list of elders and volunteer resource people is provided before the programcommences in September. To make this happen to everyone's expectations, eachperson involved in the program (staff and students) is expected to work co-operativelyso that the program will successfully achieve the goals and objectives laid out for eachtrip.Teaching in an outdoor setting is very rewarding, informative and challenging.Delivery of instructional and behavioral objectives requires a tremendous amount of 22 6214 time for planning excellent outdoor education programs. The teachers, along with thestudents, need to plan carefully together so that their classroom studies can be put intopractical use. The lessons planned for the students require observation, manipulation ofanimals or plants, research work, analyzing, recording and reinforcing topics that arerelevant and pertinent to the students' needs of skill development.Planning for the outdoor wilderness camp requires the involvement of otherparties as well. The school board has to be made aware of the plans at all times, andpermission slips from the parents have to be obtained, as well as a list of clothing thatthe child will need.D.First Nation Science and Technology ProgramThe objective of the Cross Lake Education Authority was to operate a Scienceand Technology Summer Camp and year round school camps. The Science andTechnology Summer Camp employs summer students and the schools have teachersand elders take the students to the camp during the school year. Each class is expectedto make at least one or two outings to the camp, each year. The Summer Science andTechnology Camp offers participation in the camp to a large number of students. Themission statement of the Science and Technology Camp is that education is a blend ofculture, tradition, and technology; the program will encourage our students to grasp theimportance of Science and Technology. It will increase an opportunity for our studentsto pursue career educational paths in Science and Technology. The program gives anopportunity to our students to participate at this camp. It also creates awareness of ourstudents that the First Nations people always had a history and their own traditions. Italso teaches our students to revere the culture of their parents, grandparents andancestors. It could also open the students' minds to new worlds, new ideas, and newresponsibilities that could build a bridge to the other societies of their modern world.The program promotes friendships, trust, confidence, co-operation, and goodcommunication in both English and Cree languages, leading to teamwork among thestudents. The students learn the skills of the traditional ways leading to modernScience and Technology. The students will be better prepared to enter the Science andTechnology trades and become contributing members in their First Nations Society.These students can then become role models in their chosen careers in Science andTechnology. Parents will also see the importance of supporting their children to choosecareers in Science and Technology.22215 The program of studies includes:environment and ecology (rock formation, water levels, types of rocks,etc.)traditional crafts (paddle making, camp tools, etc.)study of astrophysics (sky, stars, weather, etc.)traditional skills of the First Nations People (fishing nets, duck hunting, andpreparing and cleaning all catch)water navigation (canoeing, other boats, and understanding of safe watertravel)camp fire safety (how to start fires, types of wood available to use, safetymeasures of outdoor fires)building camp shelters (what to use, emergency shelters)use of traditional tools (firearm safety, learning names of tools in Creelanguage, use of tools, safety of tools, and caring of tools)names of places, lakes, rivers, and islands (history/origin of names andtraditional areas)preservation of foods/game (smoking foods, some picking berries, andlearning names and uses)traditional medicines (learning herbs, plants, trees, uses for medicine,learning the names in Cree)seven traditional teachings (love, respect, humility, honesty, wisdom,courage and truth)cooking (bannock making, open fire cooking)water safety (swimming)duties/responsibilities (cleaning camp facility, dorm areas, etc.)All these teach the students that they are important members of our First Nationscommunities. They learn about the traditional teachings of their people. They will havepride in themselves and can build up their self-esteem.Elders are actively involved in these camps. They teach the traditional life-skills of the camps. The students' Cree language is enriched. They learn that theirpeople have a history, a land base, nature, and all its resources. The program enrichestheir spiritual, emotional, mental and physical growth. Most of all, it teaches them torespect their environment. 22216 E.First Nations Forestry Management ProgramCross Lake Education Authority has been able to establish a true partnershipwith Natural Resources Canada in acquiring control of the management of their forestresources. In the summer of 1989, a wild fire devastated the area surrounding theCross Lake First Nations community. In fact, wild fires devastated many Northern FirstNations communities where massive evacuations took place. The community membershad to be evacuated to the rural and urban towns. After the fires, no clean up orreforestation ever took place.The Cross Lake Education Authority undertook a clean-up project; cleaningburnt areas, salvaging wood for artistic projects, developing paths for walking orbicycling, developing park/picnic areas, and reforestation of the affected areas. Allthese projects are nearby the school areas, so the schools can utilize them. The schoolsutilize these areas to teach Science and Technology because the First Nations peopleview education as a blend of culture, tradition and technology. Too many times,Science has been taught only on paper, and we believe our people learn better by ahands-on experience approach.The clean-up projects offered employment to our students and they have thatsense of ownership to these projects. The projects create awareness of forestrymanagement. It fosters awareness, to our students and community members, torespect our natural resources and to pursue careers in the area of natural resources andforestry.It also creates awareness to the total community to respect their naturalresources and how forestry affects the whole environment. It also assists and enhancesthe First Nations people in that many artistic projects can be developed from the forestsand are economically viable. Above all, the students develop recreational areas forthemselves so that they can secure that feeling of ownership and pride.F.First Nations Co-operative Education ProgramThe Cross Lake Education Authority has implemented a Co-operative EducationProgram in the Senior Years since the 1997-98 school year. This program was designedto meet the needs of the students who are delayed in their academic performance as aresult of certain conditions, such as irregular attendance, suspensions, expulsions,personal/family problems, etc. The concept of this Cooperative Education Program is toprovide students, who still want or need to be educated, to have an opportunity forfurther education, in a manner that will be unique and interesting for them. 217 The program provided a combination of academic and on-the-spot workexperience for the students. The students began with two weeks of academics and oneweek of outdoor traditional life-skills. The students spend one week at the KisipanakakWilderness Camp with their teacher and elder assistant. The combination of workexperience with in-class academics provides the students with a new outlook about thework force, while still reinforcing the importance and value of education.The majority of students in this program are 17 - 19 years of age. Theprogram provides the students with a better understanding of the work force, whichthey are soon to enter. The objectives of this program are:1.To provide students an opportunity to see their elders in different roles, and tounderstand how they support their families.2.To increase the students' awareness of the workforce and its environment.3.To link the traditional outdoor life skills with the classroom experience.4.To link classroom experiences and material with workplace experiences.5.To recognize the increased importance of a life-long education in today's society.6.To display the importance of basic Math, English, and Life Skills in today's workforce.7.To increase the students' level of \"independence.\"a)showing up at work on time;b)showing up at school on time;c)showing responsibility and maturity.8.To increase their sense of \"who they are\" as an individual as well as a member oftheir school, community and society where and how they fit in; how importantthey really are.9.To improve the students' level of reading, math, native language and oral skills.10. To make school more enjoyable for the students which, in turn, will result in thestudents putting more effort to their work.11. To prepare the students for the next level of education in all aspects.Cross Lake Education Authority has implemented the Cooperative Education Programwithin the last three years.G.Senior Years ProgramIn April 1987, the new school, Otter Nelson River School, was completed. Thisschool was supposed to accommodate all students from pre-school to senior years. After moving into the new school in the fall of 1988, we soon found out that the schoolcould not accommodate the students in senior years.In the first year of the new school, it could only accommodate the Senior IIstudents. The school was already too crowded. In 1991/92, Senior II wereaccommodated with very limited space. After four years in the new school, we still haveto send our students out to the various schools in Manitoba. Our students were soondropping out and the dropout rate was increasing at an alarming rate. The system ofsending students out was not working. Students have to be educated in their homearea; this way, they can live with their parents where they rightfully belong. In thelatter part of March 1992, the parents of Cross Lake First Nation met to discuss thesenior years' program. Many parents came to this meeting and they decided to keeptheir senior years students at home.In the 1991/92 school year, the nominal roll was 916 from Nursery to Senior II.The school was overcrowded and just could not accommodate any more students. InSenior III and IV, there were 105 students with a total of 1,021 on the nominal roll.With the senior years' students for 1992/93 school year, we were anticipating 193 senioryears' students (private home placement students). To accommodate all senior years inthe present school was totally impossible. A mandate was given to the Chief andCouncil and Cross Lake Education Authority by the senior years' parents to securefunding to build a temporary school building. As previously mentioned, our presentschool was designed to accommodate pre-school to senior years and the enrolmentprojections did not forecast long term projections, nor was the growing rate of thecommunity fully anticipated. We realized that a mistake was made on the part of Indianand Northern Affairs, Canada. Perhaps, if long-term projections were applied to the\"Student Projection Methodology,\" students would not have to be sent out.With the support of Indian and Northern Affairs, Canada and Cross Lake FirstNations, the Cross Lake Education Authority was able to secure a bank loan to build atemporary school. The school contains 14 classrooms, resource library, staff room,office and gymnasium.In the 1992/93 school year, all our senior years students attended Otter NelsonRiver School with the exception of five students. The five students were in specialprograms and met the criteria to attend school elsewhere. Otter Nelson River Schooloffered courses in Math, Sciences, English, Shops, First Native Language, and FirstNations Studies. The second semester courses were Computers, Geography, Biology,X31219 Law, Chemistry, Economics and World Issues. There were already some students whohad full creditation for a Grade 12 diploma. However, like any school, we haveproblems with attendance and dropouts. But the drop out rate is not as high as whenthey were attending school in other places.The students are closely monitored by the support staff. In the high schoolarea, there is a Guidance Counsellor, Secondary Counsellor and a Home/School Co-ordinator. These support staff members work closely with the school administration tokeep the students in school. It is a good idea to have Senior Years at the reserve level.Students are home with their parents and have more support than they would if theyattended outside the community. Since 1992, Otter Nelson River School has graduatedtwo hundred and twenty two (222) students. Many have entered colleges anduniversities.H.Community-Based Adult Training CenterIn the mid 1970's, the first community based program was brought into CrossLake known as BUNTEP (Brandon University Northern Teacher Education Program). Atthis time, there was a selected small number of teacher assistants working in theschools who were going through the PENT program (Program for Education of NativeTeachers). Over the years, there were more intakes of the BUNTEP program. To date,the Cross Lake First Nation has approximately forty-five graduates from BUNTEP andtwelve graduates from PENT. There are other graduates from the other or regularprograms from all the Manitoba universities. Throughout the years, Cross Lake hasembarked on other training programs such as regular upgrading, college preparation,literacy, homemakers, mineral exploration, counselling skills, clerical bookkeeping, andInter-Universities North. Some of the Inter-Universities North students have graduatedwith a Bachelor of General Studies degree and some are presently in the A.D. Educationprogram at Brandon University. A Transition Year Program was also offered to preparethe senior years graduates to enter colleges and universities.After the completion of our new school, Mikisew Middle School, the oldtemporary school building has since been converted to the Adult Education Center as ofJanuary 1997. Within the last two years, Cross Lake Education Authority hasestablished a partnership with Keewatin Community College. Last year, ComputerizedBusiness Skills, Business Administration I, College Preparation II and III, and twoTransition Year Programs were offered. These students receive social services incomeand were issued minimum incentive allowances to offset babysitting and transportation232220 costs. These students have been successful. In the 1998/99 school year, a TransitionProgram, Business Administration I, Computerized Business Accountancy, two MatureStudent programs I and II, and Basic Adult Education was offered with a total numberof one hundred fifty students.Presently, the Education Authority is working with Keewatin Community Collegeto develop a joint agreement to establish the Cross Lake Regionalized CommunityCollege. It is proposed that it will be fully implemented in the 1999/2000 school year.Cross Lake Education Authority's Proposed Wellness/HealinqThe educational plan we propose to implement in our schools is to develop awellness path for the students and teachers that can, perhaps, be extended to theparents and community. There is a tendency within First Nations to explain wellness asa balance of all the factors in one's life; a holistic perspective. The medicine wheelconcept helps to illustrate that the balance and connection of all the aspects of life arenecessary for wellness. Problems with one's life or within one's community arose froman imbalance or loss of connection with one or more of the aspects of the medicinewheel (Mussell, Nicholls and Adler, 1991).Education is a life-long, continuous process requiring stable and consistentsupport. First Nations people of every age group require appropriate formal andinformal opportunities for learning and for teaching. The education provided must beholistic. Education processes and institutions must address the intellectual, spiritual,emotional and physical development of participants (Royal Commission on AboriginalPeople, 1996, p. 445). The report cites that the discussion of education issues proceedsaccording to four stages of the life cycle: the child, the youth, the adult, and the elder.The medicine wheel is used as the teaching and communication tool. The medicinewheel is used to discuss relationships and values. The medicine wheel represents thecycle of life; the wheel has no beginning and no end.A.Medicine Wheel ConceptThe medicine wheel is an ancient symbol used by almost all of the First Nationspeople in North and South America. There are many expressions of the medicine wheelconcept: the four grandfathers, the four winds, the four cardinal directions, and manyother things expressed in sets of four (Bopp, Bopp and Lane, 1983).The medicine wheel is the way of life of the people. It is the understanding ofthe universe. The medicine wheel is the way given to the traditional peace chiefs, ourteachers, and from them to us, and then to our grandchildren and future generations. The medicine wheel is everything of the people. Among the traditional teachings, thefirst teaching is always the four great powers of the medicine wheel. There are fourways to be in this world, four paths to follow in the medicine wheel; they are named thegreat four directions: east, west, north, and south. The medicine wheel concept can beused to help see or understand things people cannot quite see. The medicine wheel isequally developed and is well balanced.B.Seven Traditional Sacred TeachingsWith all the nations of the First Nations people, there were Seven Grandfatherswho were given the responsibility by the Creator to watch over the First Nations people.These Seven Grandfathers were powerful teachers. Today, these are what the Firstnations refer to as the seven traditional sacred teachings. Slowly, we have been losingthese teachings, and we must bring them back to be taught to our children. Theseseven traditional sacred teachings are:Respectto feel or show honour or esteem for someone or something. Tohonour all of Creation or to show respect in the basic law of life.Wisdomlistening to and following the guidance given to your heart. Tocherish knowledge is to know wisdom.Loveto receive strangers and outsiders with a loving heart and as membersof the family. To know love is to know peace.Honesty -to be honest at all times and conditions. Honesty is facing a situationand to be brave.Humilitytrue happiness comes to only those who dedicate their lives to theservices of others. Do not fill yourself with your own affairs. Humilityis to know yourself as a sacred part of the Creation.Courageto seek the courage and strength to be a better person and to be ableto stand up for your people and to take risks. Courage is to face thefoe with integrity.Truthbeing truthful at all times and conditions. Truth to know all the sevensacred teachings.C.Talking CircleBefore implementing the development of wellness paths in the schools, thestaff will be trained about the \"Talking Circle.\" The traditional \"talking circle\" is a veryold way of bringing Native people, of all ages, together in a quiet, respectful manner forthe purposes of teaching, listening, learning and sharing. When approached in the234222 proper way, the circle can be a very powerful means of touching or bringing somedegree of healing to the mind, the heart, the body, or the spirit. One could call it a veryeffective form of Native group therapy.The circle leader, teacher, or facilitator begins by passing around sweetgrass,cedar, or sage, so that the participants may \"smudge\" themselves. We have beentaught by our ancestors that these sacred herbs have a purifying effect upon our totalbeing. As the smoke from the herbs surround us, we are better able to connect onmany levels with the others within the circle, with ourselves, and with what we areabout to experience.The group leader (or a volunteer) will then open the circle with a prayer. Thecircle is now in the hands of the Great Spirit, Grandfather, God, or whatever onechooses to call the Higher Power. The leader might next have the people shake handsto acknowledge each other.It is a good thing to do, especially if this is a new circle ofpeople.The group leader then begins to \"talk to the people\" without interruption;talking to one person, but to all who are present. All are expected to listen respectfullyuntil the speaker is finished.All who sit within the circle will have an opportunity toexpress themselves if they choose or they may simply listen, but all who speak will begiven the same respectthey will be listened to. The group leader, and most likelyothers within the circle, may bring eagle feathers or stones or other sacred objectswhich are passed around the circle and shared. We believe these sacred things to behelpers in furthering our connections to spirit and to our higher selves; they help uslisten; they aid in our learning.Within this sacred circle, we are encouraged to speak not only from the mind,but from the heart; we are free to share our innermost feelings if we choose.Regardless of whether one brings a traditional teaching or a personal problem to thecircle, all persons are valued, respected and listened to. There is an Indian belief of:right time/right place/right people/hearing right things, and we rely on that belief withinthe circle. When all have spoken, anyone may request that this be a \"closed circle,\"that all that has been said and the identities of the participants shall be confidential. Ifno one requests a closed circle, all may freely share what they have learned.The circle is closed with prayer. So in this old way we have come togetherto teach, to learn, to touch each other's spirit; that we may find strength to live in thesetwo worlds; that our people may live (Positive Indian Parenting Manual, 1994). 2232 3.5 D.Implementation of the Traditional ApproachesThere is a great need to incorporate the traditional Aboriginal approaches inour schools, more so when we are promoting healing and wellness for our students andschool staff. As mentioned earlier, our First Nations students are living in a world whichis fast-paced, competitive and a forever-changing environment. Our students arecaught with the negative forces that prevent them from getting that intellectualdevelopment and academic learning. Before any successful school change can happen,an attempt has to be made to address those experiences mentioned. In order to bringwellness and healing to the school, the whole school has to be involved. The schoolsneed to look at other programs, such as: alcohol and drug abuse, familycounselling/mediation, family planning, other addictions and abuses, and other wellnessprograms. The whole community has to network and utilize all the resources from thetotal community. The traditional values of the First Nations have almost beencompletely eroded. We need to re-teach these traditional values to our students.There has to be that strong commitment to inclusion of staff and studentwellness and early prevention strategies on wellness programs. The development of thewellness/healing plan for Cross Lake Education Authority schools sets the stage forparents and community members to make a plan for long-term support andcommitment to the students of Cross Lake First Nation.ConclusionSince Cross Lake First Nation took control of education in 1988, the educationsystem has made much progress. The number of Aboriginal school staff has growntremendously and they are fully qualified. The majority of the administration staff isAboriginal and administration staff possess administration degrees.Before local control of education, the student graduation level was in the lownumbers. Since the community brought their children home to be educated in CrossLake, the graduation numbers have significantly increased. The numbers are usually noless than thirty graduates each year. More so recently, a community-based program isoffered to prepare these students to enter colleges and universities. The dropout rate inthe senior years declined from a high of 50 60% to less than 20%. In the middleyears, the decline was not so dramatic, but the dropout rate was less than 10%.The Cross Lake Education Authority added and developed their own curriculumprogram for the revitalization of the Cree language and culture. The success rate in the 236224 post-secondary program has been generally quite high. This is most obvious in theteacher education program. Most of the major achievements include that:a)all decisions regarding Cross Lake's education system are made by theEducation Authority;b)the Education Authority is accountable to the people for the entire educationprogram;c)the hiring of staff is the responsibility of the Education Authority;d)the management of funds is the responsibility of the Education Authority;e)The Education Authority offers the senior years programming;f)the Education Authority was able to build a temporary school through a bankloan at a value of 1.4 million dollars, then constructed a 15.5 million dollarschool through a bank loan again;g)more recently, the Education Authority is working on a joint venture withKeewatin Community College to establish a Regionalized First NationsCommunity College in Cross Lake.All these accomplishments, the success story of Cross Lake EducationAuthority, stem from the creative and innovative planning of the Cross Lake First Nationpeople.

Here, culture was almost non-existent. 2 Incontrast, Giraud pointed to the Metis inhabitants of the Red River Valley, the \"civilizingnucleus of the half-breed (sic) population.\" 3 These \"Metis de la Riviere-Rouge,\" Giraudcharacterized as \"well-adjusted people, constituting a sort of mixed-blood upper class,to a large extent on a par with the white farmers.\" 4But the Metis of St. Laurent were a different type. Here, he observed, \"theirmental traits appear as incompletely developed as their biological composition ...\" 5Given these historical conclusions, it should occasion no surprise that theweakling who now addresses you should indulge in anything but an absolutely uncriticallook at the judgments of history. I hope that my poor expression will not cause youmuch trouble.The so-called \"poly-glot jabber\" of upon.The first so-called \"half-breed\" Scrip Commissioner, a lawyer from London, Ontarionamed W. P. R. Street, recounted in his 1885 report the problems he had understanding 227 2 3 9 what he understood to be the \"French\" language of the Metis of present-daySaskatchewan. It caused him trouble to translate such names as 'Crasus Tome' to'Chrysostome,\"Frozine' to 'Euphrosyne' and 'Cheboo' to Thibault.' 6I note that some of my uncivilized and uncultured friends in this room have nosuch trouble with this language. 'What is the story of the Metis? What are they like as a group, and asindividuals? It has been written, and therefore we know ... that,when the agricultural frontier advanced into the Red River Valley in the 1870's,the half-breed (sic) community of the West la nation metisse (sic) wasdoomed, and made its last ineffectual protest against extinction in theSaskatchewan Rebellion of 1885. 8It is also written, and therefore we also know, that,At Batoche, the Metis nation was broken, and thereafter, though there wereindividual Metis, and Metis communities in the West from Pembina to theAthabaska, there was no more a coherent people or a unique community.Civilization had triumphed over barbarism ...the Metis... wereshattered, andsurvive today as submerged communities and marginal persons. 9And what does history tell us about life in these submerged communities?[They] maintained their primitive characteristics and archaic economy, living ineither abundance or poverty according to the vagaries of hunting and fishing,motivated by a superstitious mind, destitute of all ambition, and rebellious tothe idea of giving schooling to their children ... ...Around the towns and villages they waited for whatever chance occupationsmight come up, or else lived in apathy and misery because the ordeal whichthey were undergoing did not evoke in them that energy which made thesuperiority of the White. 10 Also, in these submerged communities, it is written that,the bulk of the population are more and more addicted to lazy ways, and relyon the government for their source of living. They eke out a poor existence,but seldom complain of their sad lot. Some of them even like to narrate howspeculators have deceived them, and humorously give urban names to theunoccupied lands upon which they have erected their shacks, such as 'St.Boniface,\"Ft. Rouge'...11 And what does history tell us about these marginal persons who lived in thesesubmerged communities? It has been written, and therefore we know, that,...the past experiences of these people and the conditions under which theyare now living do not produce a type of person much in demand in our society.12 The reason for that has also been written about: 228 The white man's maxim, \"Work that ye may eat,\" had been entirely foreign totheir philosophy. They had never needed to work in order to exist, and had nosuch incentive. 13It is also written that,Many of the subtleties of the white man's life are as yet lost on the Metis. Mostof them remain amoral, and illegitimacy occasions no stigma. 14I hope there are no cultured single ladies here, because I have spied some amoral Metisin this gathering.Another characteristic of the marginal persons has often been remarked upon.One writer comments about a Metis' habit:sa passion in the same vein, history has about one of this speaker's quand it etait vivre16 And about the war of resistance at Batoche in 1885, it has been recentlywritten that the Metis, \"may have only dimly perceived what the real goals were ...it17Have these dim-witted marginal persons any redeeming qualities?They have an acute sense of observation which, allied to their artistic minds,explains their curious gift for drawing ... 18 Perhaps I can auction off the doodles I made on my serviette during dinner?It has also been written, and therefore we know, that, \"The Metis takenaturally to ranching, and... manyof the men affect the stetson and denim garb of thecowboy.\" 19Also,...\"they are competent lumberjacks, and take naturally to carpentry andwoodworking.\" 20But these superglue-type individuals have difficulties in adjusting their healthstatistics to meet the high Canadian general population profile because, as it is written,...\"pneumonia [is] a bugbear to people who have not yet become fully convinced of thebenefits of cool, fresh air in their cabins.\" 21 2292-\\ 4 Progress, nevertheless, is being made because ... \"the unutterable filth of adecade ago has been replaced in most instances by something approaching cleanliness.\"22And we should have known that, sooner or later, we would have Metis playingin the N.H.L. when we were told about Metis youngsters that ... \"although lacking inequipment, they have as much fun with bent branches for hockey sticks as the averageyoungster with a full kit.\" 23But, has the plight of the Metis gone unheeded by the state, and by theChurch, in Canadian history?In 1890, Sir John A. Macdonald received a letter from D. H. Macdonald withthese suggestions for the resolution of Metis demands:...I urge an early settlement of their demands. There are various ways ofaccomplishing this, either by giving scrip or by adopting some means ofbenefiting and civilizing them such as the following: To place all the semi-civilized half-breeds on a Reserve with the Protestant element on one side andthe Catholic on the other. To have an Agent and one white Assistant tomanage the Reserve who again would appoint say ten or more Native police oroverseers from among the most intelligent of the half-breeds. Should youappoint a man who is capable of controlling men, as Agent, he will easilygovern his little Colony through his Police, whom again he could governthrough their stomachs. 24And what was the motivation behind the helpful suggestion? The same letterexplains that it is \"solely for the sake of peace ... as well as because the half-breeds area political factors, that I urge an early settlement of their demands.\" 25The same motivation is revealed in a letter of a churchman to a politician. TheChurch suggested that a grant of land to it would be a good thing because Metis couldbe gathered to,remove them from the uncertain existence they were leading, and away fromthe infectious influences of vice and demoralization which, were there noprompt remedy, would very soon become a danger of extreme gravity to publicorder. 26And governments did step in and tried to do something about the Metis,because it is recorded that \"in 1941, a government rehabilitation scheme tossedthousands of dollars worth of cattle, horses and agricultural equipment among them.\" 27And how did the Metis respond to such government largesse? 'They ate thecattle, left the machinery to rust in the still uncleared timber land, and remained wardsof the government.\" 28242230 In the meantime, both academic commentators and bureaucrats had voicedthe opinion that the Metis ought to have been treated like the Indians; that is, theyought to have been placed on reserves and controlled through their stomachs, that is,by a policy of planned starvation. 29Indeed, in at least one instance, the Church did establish a Metis Reserve, butit failed. How did the churchmen react to this failure?...after having skilfully gotten around the Metis and won the approval of theGovernment, the missionaries opened the Reserve to a significant contingent ofFrench-Canadians. 30Father Lacombe, writing in 1895, described the Metis-government relationshipin this way:It is acknowledged today that the half-breeds have been well and justly treatedby the Government, but unfortunately owing to their natural improvidence,they have wasted what they received. 31 The notion that the government dealt not unreasonably with the Metis has itsadherents today, for it was written late in 1983 that,the Metis grievances were at least partly of their own making; ... thegovernment was on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion (sic) brokeout;...Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure ofconstitutional agitation; and ...he received a surprisingly fair trial. 32So thereIn 1870, the federal government recognized the existence of Metis Aboriginalrights in terms of the Manitoba Act. That recognition continued in governmentlegislation and policy into the twentieth century.In 1898, Archer Martin, a member of the Canadian Bar and a prominent writeron the legalities of land rights, wrote about the Aboriginal title of the Metis of Manitoba.He wrote,The question of Aboriginal title is not too well understood, in spite of the factthat, in the course of the rapid extension of the British Empire, it is one thatconstantly crops up...One not familiar with the peculiarities of the people known in Manitoba as half-breeds, or Metis, would naturally ask how [the Manitoba Act land grant] tothem would extinguish the Indian title, though the name itself would go toshow that they had a right in blood to participate to the extent of a moiety. 34In 1982, the Canadian state enshrined the Aboriginal rights of the Metis interms of section thirty-five of the Constitution Act.243231 1982:(1)The existing Aboriginal and treaty rights of the Aboriginalpeoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.(2)In this Act, \"Aboriginal peoples of Canada\" includes theIndian, Inuit and Metis peoples of Canada.Nevertheless, an examination of the recent literature on Metis Aboriginal rightsturns up references to \"overheated rhetoric about sacred rights\" ...,the \"semi-mysticalaura of Aboriginal rights\" 35 and an article boldly entitled 'The Case against MetisAboriginal Rights.\" 36These controversial matters are very difficult for a Metis to understand, for ithas been written that \"as soon as severe intellectual discipline is required, the mixed-blood gives up every exertion.\" 37Rather than think problems through, the Metis have focused upon a hero-figure, a symbol of their struggle for survival, Louis Riel. About him, the churchmendeclared in 1887:Nous, pretres was their Metis] tragedy that the instability and violence of Riel,reflecting the inherent instability and ready violence of his own uncertainpeople, ruined his achievement and destroyed his nation. 39In 1983, a revisionist history of Louis Riel and the Metis attracted thenewspaper headline: \"Riel deserved to hang, book says.\" 40 The same book, which waschosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club, received a reviewer's comment in Maclean'smagazine that it \"provides sad proof that a century after Riel's death, the sentiment ofvengeance remains strong.\" 41Keep in mind, ladies and gentlemen, that this choice of quotations from historymust have been motivated by what has been termed the \"extreme sensitiveness\" of theMetis. 42But, nevertheless, these are not quotations gleaned from the graffiti ofwashroom walls! These quotations are not the off-hand remarks of uneducated personsin a moment of passion! These quotations are gathered from the words of thehistorians of the highest esteem in this country, and from writings in learned journals 24:4.232 written by professional writers who could draw upon the resources of the educatedperson in Canada.Is there anything that all writers are agreed upon concerning the Metis? Yes, Ithink most are agreed that the Metis, these one-and-a-half men (half-Indian, half-French and half-devil) can have fun in their own way ... canhave fun being devils.Isee some of those people that I know right now. I think I shall go join them ... Waiter,bring us five gallons of red wine and call the cops! 43 Endnotes 1 M.

I propose also to comment on some of themajor aspects of the current public dialogue on Aboriginal issues. Finally, I shall offer atentative outline of a conception of the law of Aboriginal rights that might accommodatethe constitution and reconstitution of Aboriginal nations in Canada, as a modestcontribution to the debate which will follow today.It is clear to me that the litmus test to judge Canada's policy response to theRCAP approach to Aboriginal nation governance is the adoption of the recommendationsin volume 2 (Appendix, p. 165-166) to enact legislation to establish a process wherebythe government can recognize the accession of an Aboriginal group or groups to nationstatus and its assumption of authority as an Aboriginal government to exercise its self-governing jurisdiction (Rec. 2.2.27). The companion recommendation is the holding of aFirst Ministers and Aboriginal leaders conference to create a forum charged with drawingup a Canada-wide framework agreement to establish common principles and directionsto guide the negotiation of treaties with recognized Aboriginal nations (Rec. 2.3.28; App.A, p. 166, Vol. 5).As you know, the federal response has not ventured into this area at all; theDepartment of Indian Affairs and the. Indian Actcontinue to govern federal policy; thePrime Minister has shown no interest in such a national meeting. While the Premiershave made repeated calls for such a conference, their interest seems to focus not onjustice for Aboriginal peoples, but on trying to prevent 'federal off-loading.' Aboriginalleaders, preoccupied as they must be with the affairs most pressing to theirorganizations and their constituents, have done little to promote a national concertedapproach to the federal recognition of Aboriginal nations. Where things really matter,there is nothing new under the sun.None of this is intended to trivialize the projects that have been undertaken byCanada. Important initiatives have been undertaken, in the name of a response to248236 RCAP, in areas such as Youth Centres, health care, and in addressing the legacy ofabuse at Indian Residential Schools, those domiciles of despair and trauma that were apart of the strategy of dismantling Aboriginal cultures and nations.The RCAP's central recommendation was phrased in the principle ofparticipation and elaborated in the first pages of the final report. No more shouldfederal Aboriginal policy be developed and decided in isolation, but only in effectiveconsultation with Aboriginal people, the ostensible beneficiaries of such policy. Howdoes the federal response of January 1998 measure up? Its language is the language ofCupertino and partnership, but we find that much of the policy itself was developedunilaterally by federal officials. We heard representatives of those Aboriginal people notserved by the Department of Indian Affairs complain that it was not a good start tolaunch a partnership policy in isolation from its would-be partners.The federal response trumpeted calls for reconciliation, as if there had oncebeen conciliation in all cases. One such call was directed at my own people, the Metisnation of Western North America, and proposed that something be done to deal with the'sad events culminating in the death of Metis leader Louis Riel.' In renewing ourpartnership,' the policy stated, 'we must ensure that the mistakes which marked our pastrelationship are not repeated.' Yet, we find that, recently, federal officials commissionedor conducted a public poll on exonerating Riel without telling the representatives of theMetis people about it. These are the federal officials in charge of government relationswith representatives of the Metis. The Metis representatives apparently found out aboutthe poll the way the rest of us did by reading about it in the newspapers.It used to be that civil servants advised governments on sound policy options;today, in Canada, some of them seem to have undertaken the role of pollsters who feedinstant opinion to elected officials who have forsaken the role of leadership andmediation of conflicting interests. What is happening to our political culture?Allow me to state my dismay at politicians' attempts, in the name of'reconciliation,' to tamper with the soul of the Metis nation by suggesting that they willdeal with Riel. As a young boy, I heard about Riel and particularly Dumont, about thefighting and the heroism of the people who fought on our side against the strangersfrom the East.I absorbed the idea that Riel was a symbol of the Metis struggle forjustice and part of our mythic stories, those inherited from our ancestors and woven intothe very fabric of our collective identity. For me, Riel is a Metis hero and symbol of 237 injustice because that was the view of my father and the views of my people. Relyingon the spiritual self-sufficiency of my people, I have no need to feed my self-identitywith the approbation of strangers about Riel's actions. The story of Riel is a stain inCanada's story; let the stain remain.There are some, of course, who take a different view, even among Metispeople. Recognizing that Riel was unjustly tried and convicted for reasons of politicalambition, they nevertheless would now go, cap in hand, to Parliament Hill and ask forthe blessing of the grandchildren of the immigrants who hanged Riel.Reconciliation, as official government policy, is not an easy task; the events ittries to deal with engage the emotions and stir the soul. They are almost always storiesof conflict, of triumph and tragedy, and they involve people portrayed as winners andlosers. It is easier to use such stories to stir nationalistic feelings and rouse politicalfollowers than to promote reconciliation.The way the reconciliation policy on Riel is being developed illustrates anotherimportant point. The marginalization and political powerlessness of Aboriginal peoplecan be measured by the extent to which their identities, both individual and collective,can be manipulated and influenced by the dominant society. The case of persons whoaccept that their identity is affected by legislation such as the notorious 'Bill-C31' is well-known. But consider this as a measure of the marginalization of the Metis people; wecan not even determine the status of our own national heroes, an important determinantof national identity. Our conception of ourselves is influenced by what others thinkabout us. The federal approach shows Metis people on the sidelines, witnesses to anunseemly national debate between liberal strangers on the Hill, on the one hand, andthe caretakers of the racism of the 19th century on the other hand. There must besome merit in the adage that 'reconciliation means one side has all the power and youbetter get reconciled to that.'The RCAP final report did not deal with simple issues. We had to makearguments about the place of Aboriginal individuals and groups not only within the socialfabric of Canada, but also within the common law and the law of the Constitution. Wehad to deal with questions about the identity of 'nations' or 'peoples' in which a commonlaw right of self-government might be vested, in the absence of case law. We had toreconcile constitutional principles that animate the Chatter of Rights and Freedoms withothers that animate the affirmation and protection of group rights in section 35 of theConstitution Act 1982. Today, several years later, these large questions still remain250238 largely untouched by the case law, and must be approached on the basis of principle.I believe that if Aboriginal self-government is going to have any significance inthe common law of Canada, it has to be based on a coherent explanation of the law ofthe Charter pertaining, to individuals on the one hand, and the law of group rights insection 35, on the other hand. The educative function of the law might be engagedhere to debunk the popular notion that Aboriginal self-government suffers the infirmitiesof 'race-based' legal regimes. Here is my tentative attempt to do that, taking advantageof the principles that may be discerned in the jurisprudence since the release of theRCAP final report.One of the most persistent red herrings dragged across the path of publicdebate is the myth that Aboriginal self-government proposed that special rights beaccorded to 'racial minorities.' This bogey man is raised only to be knocked down bypeople who categorically oppose Aboriginal rights for all sorts of reasons, not all of themhonourable. This pernicious notion must be debunked if Aboriginal self-government is tobe accepted in the long run as a legitimate idea based upon principles that are broadlyacceptable to both Aboriginal people and the Canadian public.'As long ago as 1942, Ashley Montagu had exposed the fallacy of 'race' as'Man's Most Dangerous Myth.' 2 Adopting Montagu's explanation that myths provide asanction for action, we can see that opponents of Aboriginal rights create the myth of'racial minorities' to provide a false explanation for the differences between Aboriginalpeoples and others in Canada. Associating this false difference with South Africanapartheid and the struggle for equal civil right by African Americans, the myth has strongpublic appeal. As the RCAP Final Report explains, the Aboriginal 'peoples,' as such,comprise distinct historic, social and political communities, and not racial minorities. Thesignificant difference between Aboriginal peoples and others in Canada is that they arehistoric 'peoples' who have been dispossessed in their homelands and who deserve,today, the benefit of the recognition and respect demanded by contemporary notions ofhuman rights and other norms of public morality. It is a matter of community, notbiological descent. It is a process whereby individuals and communities nurture a senseof belonging based on history and culture, on kinship and place. It is not biologicaldeterminism foisted upon communities.Unfortunately, the Supreme Court of Canada has itself fed the myth of 'race' in decidedcases, and the Charter constitutionalizes it. Given this background, it is necessary toreview the distinction between individuals identified on the basis of 'race' and entitled to 2392 :51 the equal benefit of the law by virtue of s. 15 of the Charter, on the one hand, and theAboriginal communities in which are vested group rights protected by s. 35 of Part II ofthe Constitution Act 1982, on the other hand.In cities and towns across Canada, there are individuals who are geneticallydescended from the people who were here from the beginning, the 'ab-original' people,but who do not belong to any particular Aboriginal community. Perhaps, they wereadopted to strangers at birth; perhaps, they were born of parents themselves descendedfrom two or more historic Aboriginal groups and who do not identify themselves withany one Aboriginal community. In this illustrative case, the Charter, which is concernedwith the rights of individuals and not of historic nations, requires that these persons beequally entitled to the benefit of the law and prohibits adverse discrimination based,inter a /ia, on 'race.' Section 15(2) goes on to permit affirmative action for individualsand groups of individuals who have been disadvantaged on account of 'race,' perhaps inemployment opportunities or in access to housing. Through the clumsy notions of 'race'and 'racial minorities,' the Charter requires equality and affirmative action based on thenotion of corrective justice, ideas that conform with Canadians' views of individual andsocial justice.At this point, it may be emphasized that neither these individuals nor thegroups of individuals contemplated by s. 15 have, per se, any group rights. To myknowledge, no credible argument that an individual has a right of self-government hasbeen made. Neither do groups comprised of such disadvantaged individuals have, onthat account alone, any claim to self-government.Turning to section 35, we note that the Aboriginal and treaty rights protectedby the Constitution are 'existing' rights; they are vested in historic peoples that were apart of the Canadian historical, social and political fact in 1982, and in the members ofthe communities comprising these 'peoples.' I adopt the RCAP definition of an Aboriginal'people,' or 'nation,' in which the common law right of Aboriginal self-government isvested; that is, 'a sizeable body of Aboriginal people with a shared sense of nationalidentity that constitutes the predominant population in a certain territory or group ofterritories.'3As a dynamic political and social community with group rights, a 'people' insection 35 must consist of freely associated individuals who share a common sense ofbelonging and a vision of a common destiny. The constitutional values of democracyand freedom of community association cannot permit the foisting of an unwanted252240 identity and legal status dictated by birth alone upon an individual.On the other side of the coin, the basic objective of Aboriginal rights, that ofprotecting distinct cultures of Aboriginal peoples, would not be advanced by coercing allindividuals identified by 'racial ancestry' to form the 'self of 'self-governing' communities.Group rights recognize that the protection of a distinct culture is only possible if thegroup has the right to create conditions in which the culture may survive and flourish.Any rights exercisable by individuals are exercisable by virtue of their membership in anhistoric cultural community, and not by virtue of their personal antecedents alone.The RCAP report recognized the fact that the historic nations have beensubmerged, cultures damaged, and that the process of constituting and reconstitutingnations would be a difficult process that in many, but not all, cases would take time. Inthe meantime, the Supreme Court has found that Aboriginal rights are vested in rathersmall communities that could not meet the test of constituting a 'people' having a rightof self-government on the RCAP model. So-called 'site-specific' Aboriginal rights to usethe resources of the land require an account of Aboriginal self-government thataccommodates the existence of small Aboriginal communities with certain rights with atheory of a right of Aboriginal self-government vested in large groups.The fundamental principle of 'democracy' and other constitutional valueselaborated in the Quebec Secession Reference allow the argument that the right of self-government may be exercised when either a 'nation' on the RCAP model or anaggregation of small 'core' Aboriginal communities, identified by the common law teststo prove Aboriginal rights, have demonstrated the will of the people comprising the'nation' to exercise the right of self-government.It seems to make sense, in light of both historic and contemporary facts, torecognize that smaller communities may, by democratic means, assert their commonvision of acting as a self-governing nation. The principle of 'subsidiary' or of 'delegationupward' of governing authority may assist an explanation of the doctrine of Aboriginalself-government that follow the RCAP model of vesting the right in larger groups andalso accommodates the Courts' development of a doctrine of Aboriginal rights vested insmaller communities.The difference with the RCAP model, here, is that authority to govern isdelegated upwards to the 'nation' and not downward to the communities that compriseit.It is thought that this concept better reflects the need to ensure the legitimacy ofpolitical representation and respects the fundamental principle of democracy. 241253 In conclusion, the right of self-government is not vested in villages or 'bands'created by the Indian Act; it is vested in 'peoples' freely constituted according todemocratic principles. The right is not vested in groups of individuals who cometogether by virtue alone of personal descent from Aboriginal ancestors, but is vested ingroups comprised of freely associated communities identified by the common law testsof Aboriginal rights.Individuals have Aboriginal rights by virtue of their belonging to the group, andthey belong to the group by virtue of their participation in the life of the community,reflected in their participation in the activities that comprise Aboriginal rights at thecommunity level. Aboriginal rights, understood in this sense, are never 'portable;' theyinhere in communities and individuals in their communities.The true policy of self-government must recognize all such Aboriginalcommunities and meet Canada's obligations to make the common law right of self-government effective.I should emphasize that these arguments have to be based on what the courtsof Canada might adopt. In doing so, I have not been able to consider what justicemight demand or what might be the implications of applying the norms behind theinternational concept of the right of self-determination of peoples. We have to recognizethe role of law in rationalizing the exercise of power, and there is little point in makingarguments that the courts cannot accept if they are to keep their political legitimacy asthe courts of Canada.It is not difficult to criticize the Court's approach to developing the doctrine ofAboriginal rights. Ever since the decision in Kruger, 4 it has been apparent that theCourt was safeguarding its participation in the development of Aboriginal rights policy.It might have been better for the Court to develop concepts of obligations requiring thegovernment to negotiate the contents of Aboriginal rights with Aboriginal peoplesdirectly, rather than set itself up as the forum for deciding the contents of socialrelations within Aboriginal communities and peoples. In undertaking this role, the Courthas had to introduce unfamiliar changes to judicial analysis, such as receiving oraltestimony about historical events, and the implications have not been happily receivedby any side. The Court's adoption of what might be called a broad policy approach todeveloping the doctrine of Aboriginal rights has the advantage of opening the scope ofarguments to do justice, but with the disadvantages of legal uncertainty.Adopting the RCAP approach to Aboriginal self-government requires the2 5 4242 adoption of a vision of Canada as a multi-national North American country, as opposedto a multi-cultural country in which Aboriginal peoples struggle among themselves forlast place.How much can the law help the development of a vision of a multi-nationalCanada comprised of self-governing Aboriginal nations, as well as retain Lord Durham'sconception of 'two nations warring in the bosom of single state?' The Supreme Courthas been eloquent in proclaiming its role as the guardian of the Constitution and therights of minorities who cannot wield power at the ballot box. I think that watching thedevelopment and application of the unwritten principles of the constitution elaborated inthe Quebec Secession Reference to the doctrine of Aboriginal rights, particularly politicalrights which are engaged in the debate on Aboriginal self-government, should give us agood answer to that question.5 Principles such as democracy and the protection ofminorities, along with the theory of government obligation identified in that case, offerrich prospects for the development of the right of Aboriginal self-government. Thecourt's role will be tested. In time, the Quebec Secession Case might be seen, inretrospect, as the most important Aboriginal rights case in history.In conclusion, I emphasize that the RCAP concluded that fundamentalchange is required to provide justice for Aboriginal people, and fundamental change isnot easy to achieve in a country where Aboriginal people do not carry much politicalweight, and where a legacy of deep mistrust haunts relations between Aboriginalpeoples and Governments. As illustration of that fact, consider that, in 1982, theframers of the Constitutional amendment saw fit to constitutionalize the calling of ameeting of First Ministers and Aboriginal leaders; 6 Canada must be the only country onearth to have so constitutionalized mistrust.Allow me to conclude by referring to the comments of the Human RightsCommittee of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, meeting in Geneva thismonth. Noting Canada's admission that the situation of the Aboriginal peoples remainsthe most pressing human rights issue facing Canadians, the Committee expressed itsconcern that Canada has not yet implemented the recommendations of the RoyalCommission on Aboriginal peoples. Citing instances of failure to abide by internationalhuman rights standards, the Committee criticized Canada's failure to explain theelements that make up the right of self-determination as applied to Canada's Aboriginalpeoples.The issue of Aboriginal governance is clearly not a matter of unilateral claims by 243255 Aboriginal peoples in Canada. It is a matter of right to be found in common lawprinciples, a matter of affirmation and protection by the law of the constitution, and amatter of abiding by fundamental concepts of State obligation and public moralityrequired by international law.

This is the case that wasreferred by the Government of Canada on the question of the legal validity of Quebecsecession from Canada. In rendering its decision, the Court elaborated some importantnew 'unwritten principles of the constitution' which are to be applied to theinterpretation of the Constitution. These principles may be developed in favour of'political rights' as part of the doctrine of Aboriginal rights, and, in particular, to argue forpositive obligations of Government to respond to political initiatives and claims of theAboriginal peoples whose rights are now protected in specific provisions of theConstitution.6 Section 37 of the Constitution Act 1982, as amended, required the Prime Minister ofCanada to convene several conferences of First Ministers to discuss 'constitutionalmatters that directly affect the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, including the identificationand definition of the rights of those peoples to be included in the Constitution ofCanada,' and to invite representatives of the Aboriginal peoples to the conference. 256244 Working for the Government in IndigenousEducation: Strategic Planning in Current MaoriEducation in New ZealandRawiri Brell One of the most important challenges in education is in the area of policydevelopment and implementation for the government. This is even more challenging ifyou happen to belong to an Indigenous group of people who have a special relationshipwith the government, and those people are not receiving the same kinds of benefitsfrom the government's programmes as everyone else.As the Indigenous minority in New Zealand, Maori people have a specialrelationship with the Crown, which is set out in the Treaty of Waitangi (see below)signed between Maori chiefs and the British Crown in 1840. The Treaty sets outobligations of the Crown to Maori to protect their language and culture, and all thatentails, and to protect their right to self government. The Treaty also provides theCrown with an obligation to govern in the interests of all New Zealanders, but takingcognisance of the special relationship the Crown has with Maori.Since 1840, the actions of the Crown have broken down some of the keybinding elements of Maori tribes their language, significant parts of the culture, theirbasis of economic development, their land, fisheries and forests. This has been achievedby a carefully constructed process of colonisation through the key instruments ofgovernment legislation and resourcing. The European churches have also takenadvantage of this process.Since the late sixties, the focus on global Indigenous peoples' rights has helpedmany countries involved actively in colonisation to refocus their legal and economicobligations to those groups which have lost out economically, culturally, and spiritually.As nations come to grips with repairing the wrong-doings of their ancestors, Indigenousgroups are able to move forward, putting aside the actions of the past and refocusingtheir energies on rebuilding and revitalising.For Maori tribes in New Zealand, addressing the injustices of the past is a major257245 priority and one which has become an integral part of the psyche of the culture. It is arelatively new phenomenon, consuming enormous amounts of human and financialresources in a process of settlement.The challenge for both Maori and the Government is to address these importantissues in an environment where the majority of tribes have yet to have their treatyconcerns settled, and where the consequences of colonisation such as disadvantagecaused by poorly aligned education policy and the effect this has had on employment,health, housing, and so on, must be addressed as well.Making this even more challenging is the priority for Maori to want to take overaddressing these issues themselves in partnerships with various governmentdepartments and within the parameters set by government.With tribes and the government at various stages of addressing treaty issuesand issues to do with education, welfare, health, employment and so on, there is anincreasing need by government to ensure that its way of thinking about how it does allof this work is well grounded in a clear vision about where the nation, as a whole, shouldbe heading, and for Maori to be able to see itself clearly in this. For Maori, this meansbeing able to articulate their own vision grounded in their values of culture andlanguage. There will always be debate between the 'sovereign' responsibility of theCrown and the 'self development' responsibility of Maori. Agreement on this issue is farfrom over and, until it is, Maori will feel disempowered to be able to manage and governtheir own affairs.The Role of Maori Public ServantsFor Maori public servants, these tensions are real and challenging. Multipleaccountabilities gnaw away at the Maori public servant drawing them into sub-tribal,tribal, and pan-tribal conflicts betw6en different policies and strategies developed bydifferent government departments. At the heart of being able to manage theopportunities, which can result from these tensions, is the need for a clear strategyabout how to move forward and the need for clear parameters of accountability.There is often much criticism of Maori public servants especially those workingin education and, more particularly, Maori education. They are blamed for all the Maorifailure in schools and communities, and are regularly criticised for not making changessuggested by so-called experts working in the field. They are drawn into stakeholderdebates over resources, and debates about supporting the value of one Maoriintervention over another. They arg also at the call of politicians and are often drawn258246 into sometimes complex Maori/Crown situations because they are Maori.Balancing the different accountabilities requires skill and expertise, and this ismade much easier if what is being pursued in a policy sense aligns well with what tribesare expecting, and the channels for this to happen are open and transparent.Influencing the leadership in government to work in this way is a critical role for Maoripublic servants which can have positive flow on effects in the way policies are thoughtabout, developed and implemented. This kind of relationship, which draws in both Maoriand the Crown, is part of a longer-term process for moving responsibility and authorityto Maori for the control of social and educational services, in partnership with theGovernment.Often, in the 'struggle' to improve Maori education and Maori involvement inhow this comes about, those working in the field as part of the education machinery canforget that Maori public servants are an integral part of that machinery and have animportant role to play. Writing them off because they might be too close to Governmentis a tactical error, which potentially can reduce the overall effectiveness of utilising allthe resources a Government is providing to ensure a better Maori education outcome.Maori public servants thinking the same way fall into a similar trap. Quality and openMaori leadership, which can focus on a broad across-the-board approach, underpinnedby the principal values and beliefs of tribes, can help focus attention on making the bestuse of all the resources (human and financial) to address these important issues.Another important role for Maori public servants and the senior leaders of themain government department is to ensure that non-Maori public servants are heldresponsible for the quality of their services to Maori. In the Ministry of Education, theperformance management system, which provides the framework for performanceagreements and appraisals, ensures that staff must meet a minimum standard in theway they work in Maori education policy development, implementation and operations.They are appraised on these competencies regularly and this is linked to remuneration.Alongside this, there is an on-going programme of training and development in the areaof Maori responsiveness, which involves four-day visits to tribal areas living in the heartof different sub-tribes sharing information, concerns and hospitality with the localpeople. Maori language courses are provided for all staff who want this, and there is aregular programme of seminars based on key strategic and policy-related matters to dowith Maori. The Ministry has implemented a process which monitors its overall259,247 responsiveness to Maori. Reports on this are provided to relevant Ministers of theCrown.Some of the key issues in addressing Maori concerns in educationIt is reasonably clear to many in New Zealand that responsiveness to thingsMaori has been quite significant over the last 10 years, but there is still much more todo.In 1997, the Ministry of Education commissioned a meta analysis by SimonChapple, Richard Jefferies and Rita Walker, of the Maori education literature andresearch produced since 1988. The reviewers found strong evidence to show that therelative family resource position of Maori is an important contributor to educationdisparities.First, it was indisputable that, on average, Maori families have fewer materialresources than non-Maori families in terms of income and housing. For many years,Maori have had to spread those fewer resources over more children than other groups insociety. In addition, Maori parents have had less education, including lower literacylevels themselves, to pass on to their children.These disparities begin at birth in terms of lower amounts of material andcultural capital available to Maori children. The impact of the lack of resources is likelyto be cumulative since the resources are necessary to help performance at every stageof the education system.They found that many educationalists have focused on the school system asthe primary and current source of disparity. However, despite its popularity, theevidence in favour of the school side barriers argument was not that strong. Thereviewers found that ethnographic studies in the area are rich in detail and description,but frequently difficult to generalize outside the area of study.Conclusions sometimes appear to be overly dependent on the prior views andexperiences of the researchers. However, this did not mean that the school systemmight not be an important source it was just that the present research and literaturewas not strong in providing reliable evidence to support this.There is some support in favour of the peer pressure hypothesis, but the arearemains under-researched. Peer pressure not to succeed may be caused, in part, bywhat the reviewers call opposing secondary cultural characteristics, developed by Maorias a result of the historical accumulation of the effects of colonisation, land confiscation,assimilative pressures and relocation of many Maori into working class urban 280248 environments. There is some support for this theory from the fact that, on somedimensions, Pacific Island school leavers perform better than Maori, given that theircultures and languages remain largely intact back in their home islands.If issues such as racism and discrimination on ethnic grounds were substantialcauses, then one would expect similar results with other minority groups. Again, whatmight be a contributing factor is the interaction of the school side barriers with thesecondary cultural characteristics of Maori developed as a consequence of over-accumulation of the effects of colonisation.There was not much agreement about the multi-dimensional nature of thecauses, but the Ministry needed to have a better understanding of how all of theseinteract and, in particular, the sequence in which these things happen and theirsubsequent effects on other kinds of attitudes and behaviours. The factors which createthis dynamic are varied and complex, and some will be difficult to fix quickly, althoughthere will always be pressure for this to happen.The point about having a good understanding of the causes, the dynamics, andincentives these create is that it provides a more reliable position from which to start toaddress the issues. What is relevant is the order in which this might need to happen andthis is certainly made easier when the medium- to long-term direction is established andthe present situation is known. Understanding the present situation involves theimplementation of a more deliberate plan of research, which was one of the mainreasons for the Chapple work. This, subsequently, has become part of an internalMinistry project to develop a Maori education research framework, one which willprovide, inter alia, a more reliable way for assessing research priorities.When this information is combined with information from Maori about whatthey want from education, it becomes an important starting point for all of the Ministry'swork. We have certainly had very strong messages in the past about what these pointsare, but getting the other side right is always going to be a challenge.Some of the whanau (family) wrap-around efforts in kohanga (Maori mediumearly childhood language nests grounded in a strong Maori philosophy) and kurakaupapa Maori (Maori medium primary and secondary schools grounded in a strongMaori philosophy) show that education can be an important catalyst for not only helpingto improve learning, but also in strengthening the whanau. Targeted Maori parenteducation and literacy support can strengthen the efforts in these situations as canpromoting other activities and benefits which can help strengthen the role of whanau 2492 61 and parent. There are many lessons to be learnt from these enterprising activities andthey need to be seen as an integral part of the way we do things from now on. It issuspected that the amount of leadership and energy this kind of activity absorbs isenormous but, as some people are saying, the effort is well worth it.The present policy responseAt present, there is a significant programme of policies covering all sectors ofeducation, much of which has relevance and importance to the education of Maori.They include a range of policies aimed at supporting the expansion and qualityof Maori medium education in different options, in the early childhood, schools and postschools sectors. The Government's Maori Language Strategy sets out a number ofstrategic objectives designed to improve the chances of the language surviving. This hasincluded a Maori Language Education Plan which focuses on teacher supply, resources,assessment, and school and community support for learning the language. Otherpolicies cover areas such as Maori teacher workload, Maori boarding schools, curriculumresources, teacher education, professional development, and so on.There are more generic policies designed to help students who experiencelearning and behavioral difficulties or who are from low income communities. Theseinclude:the Targeted Funding for Educational Achievement funding formula (a targetedresource to support schools in poor communities);encouragement being given to schools to form clusters for governance andmanagement purposes;Maori focus within Special Education 2000, a policy for students with learning andbehavioral needs;work that falls under the general umbrella of Strengthening Families, a programmebetween three government departments (Health, Welfare and Education) aimed atbetter coordination of services to very at-risk families;support for the \"Books in Home\" scheme, a programme jointly funded by theGovernment and the private sector where primary school children in poorcommunities are given new books to keep;schooling improvement initiatives a national programme to help failing schools;National Assessment initiatives to derive better information on student performance;School attendance and alternative education initiatives;Maori boarding scholarships and grants;X62250 Targeted Individual Entitlements to support Maori children to attend private schools;the Fully Funded Optionan option where primary and secondary schools receiveall of their staffing and operations funding to manage themselves often referred toas bulk funding.(Note: There are 2,700 primary and secondary state schools in New Zealand. Eachis governed by a board of trustees elected every three years. The board is thegeneral employer of the professional staff of the school, although the principal is theday-to-day manager of the professional staff. About 300 schools have opted to befully funded. The rest have their teacher salaries paid and managed centrallythrough the Ministry of Education. The majority of the 140,000 Maori childrenattend the main-stream schools, while about 4,000 are enroled in kura kaupapaMaori state schools. There are about 650,000 students enrolled in primary andsecondary education in New Zealand.)There is also a range of services provided by the Specialist Education Service,Careers Service, New Zealand Qualifications Authority, Skill New Zealand, and EarlyChildhood Development. These are Crown education agencies contracted by theMinister of Education to provide specialist services to the education sector. In somelocalities, there is private sponsorship of certain school-related activities. Some schoolsalso make use of other local and central government schemes. In Rotorua City, theNgati Whakaue Tribal Endowment Fund, which draws a consideration resource fromcentral city rentals, redistributes this to schools around Rotorua. This fund now has amuch stronger focus on supporting Maori education initiatives.Outside these areas, the move to more enabling resources and remunerationpolicies and the forthcoming review of the Education Act offer some potential to increasethe responsiveness of the school system to better meet the needs of Maori students.Quite apart from issues of additional resources, there are questions aboutwhether the overall thrust and balance of policies is being well directed at the areas ofgreatest priority and immediate need. For example, in discussions with some schoolsand their communities, we get a sense that the range of policy options available can bequite overwhelming and that opportunities are being lost because schools are stretchedor don't have the capability.We know that policies are interpreted differently by different people, and indifferent situations, and with different results. The sum effect of this can be quite263251 variable where two schools of similar profiles, drawing children from very similarcommunities, can come up with quite different results. In the work on the East Coast(Ngati Porou Tribe) and in some of the Northland schools, a lot of this variability is dueto the way the professional leadership is able to read and interpret policy and, therefore,make best use of the resources they have. A lot has to do with how communitiesrespond to their responsibilities, and the way they interact with their teachers andprincipals.If the capability is not up to scratch, then it's going to affect the education ofthe students. Some of this capability is dependent on the quality of basic groundingreceived in initial teacher training and in subsequent professional and curriculumdevelopment.A framework for a more strategic way of addressing Maori educationIn 1997, the Ministry was directed by Government to develop a more strategicway to address Maori education concerns. The over-arching reasons for doing thiswere:to break down the 'ad hocery' that builds up as policies are adjusted to bring abetter focus on Maori, usually after the event;to establish a more deliberate plan of action for closing the gap between Maori andnon-Maori; andto explore options to increase the return on current Vote: Education spending and,in the second instance, to explore new options.The strategy would signal not only a new direction, but also a new imperative byGovernment to focus attention on the education of Maori over the medium term, linkingthis to other strategies in the social and economic area. An important ingredient in all ofthis would be the role Maori would take in partnership with the Government.The main messages coming from the consultation with Maori, as a basis todevelop the framework were:Maori wanted more say in education;there needed to be more accountability;there needed to be more responsiveness and diversity in education;there needed to be changes in attitudes and expectations; andthere needed to be better information and communication.There certainly was some acceptance that everyone could do more (parents, schools,and teachers).In the Ministry's thinking about the broad shape of an education strategy264252 framework, five inter-connected strands or elements act as the basis for how we mightaddress Maori education concerns. These are relevant to all involved, and they includeboth mainstream education challenges and those to do with Maori medium education.The first is about much better communication.Good communication is about saying the right things at the right time and inthe right way, and, naturally, based on good information. In some areas, we do lackgood information and getting this can sometimes be difficult. The Chapple workhighlighted some of this. We know ourselves, as both managers and teachers, and asstudents, how difficult it is to get good information at the right time and in a form that iseasily understood. Working out the best way to do this, so the task is efficient, is animportant value to consider in taking a more strategic approach (the Chapple, lefferies,Walker report mentioned earlier has two versions, the first is the technical academicversion and then there's a more lay person's version).How we communicate our messages is absolutely critical. It is one of the mostbasic of all of our needs, but is probably given the least amount of importance becausewe sometimes assume, and wrongly so, that everyone will understand what we'resaying. Naturally, a lot depends on what you have to say, how you say it, and whetherthe message is one that you want to hear. Knowing what all the different groups aresaying and how they see the problems being solved does help to draw the biggerpicture. Making the connections across these different players and facilitatinginformation sharing is an important part of our work and, no doubt, yours. The sameskill is required of teachers as they communicate with parents, their colleagues, and theirstudents.Becoming more effective in how we communicate our messages can happen ina number of areas:providing Maori with good information and a greater ability to get more fromexisting policies, such as being clear about the expectations that parents andteachers should hold for the education progress of Maori students;providing information that not only describes a policy, but also helps explain thedifferent ways in which policies could be utilised by schools and trustees;refocusing the Ministry's information and communication strategies to put greateremphasis on communication to communities and applying more face to faceexchanges;providing examples of good practice in ways where schools and communities can utilise the information quickly and effectively;providing good information and advice to iwi (tribes) and other Maori groupswanting to become involved in education;utilising existing networks of other education agencies, of Maori education groups,local networks, and the Maori media to help communicate information;building and maintaining good working relationships with key Maori groups ineducation to help informed thinking around new initiatives and to explore localsolutions and opportunities.All of these points have relevance for the Ministry and other education providers andstakeholders.The second strand has to do with maximising the benefits from new policywork.Education stakeholders and consumers need to be assured that, when theMinistry is developing policies, it should have a good idea of their likely effects on Maoripeople. One of the best ways to do this is to involve Maori in the process, and one ofthe best ways to do this is to have already developed good and reliable two-wayrelationships with Maori people.This would not only be for consultation purposes, but also to leverage off theirnetworks and leadership, and they off ours. At the heart of this is the goal to build andkeep alive healthy alliances which, at the end of the day, become a foundation forhelping to sustain a more strategic way of using resources and for getting better results.The issue is whether this is seen as'an integral and necessary part of the Ministry'sbusiness, or an add on, something to do when things go wrong. The former is certainlybeing promoted as the most viable, especially for the long term.A significant factor in helping to improve outcomes for Maori is the role thatnon-Maori have to play. After all, they basically control much of the resources and makemost of the decisions which impact on Maori, and they are largely responsible for thegeneral direction education is heading. Without their support and effort, changes in thegeneral stream of education could continue to be slow. Many of the changes inresponsiveness to Maori mentioned before have come from non-Maori cause champions.Some of them might have seen their efforts as a Treaty obligation, but many others seetheir commitment as a very sensible way to improve Maori outcomes. Workingalongside them to build their responsiveness to Maori, through the instruments ofperformance management systems, information provision, professional development and 46 t3254 quality assurance monitoring, is a critical role for Maori in the Ministry.Effective monitoring and evaluation to help inform the ongoing review of policyis important and would also relate to new initiatives such as:Developing an effective National assessment strategy;Tertiary and Teacher Education reviews;Education Act review and improving accountability;Maori language education plan as part of a wider Maori Language Strategy;National Qualifications Framework developing Maori unit standards andqualification approval roles to support Maori knowledge, traditional andcontemporary.The third element is the evaluation of existing policies and theireffectiveness.An important, part of taking a more strategic approach has to do withunderstanding how well current policies are working. Linked to this, in the short term,and as part of better communications, is improving access, understanding facilitationand, as said before, the quality of communications. For example, a school clusteringproject, which aims to reduce the workload of principals and boards, was not wellcommunicated, so many schools remain unaware of its benefits. Another example wasthe additional support provided, in 1997, for professional development for Maori teachereducators to help strengthen their capability in Maori medium education, for which therewas little response.In the medium to long term, there needs to be an ongoing and systematicreview of the policy programme, identifying where policies are working, exploring waysto increase the workability of these in areas where there isn't any progress, identifyingwhere there are gaps and coming up with new options for these. As said before, it isboth about making better use of existing allocations and exploring new options. It's alsoabout letting people know about successful initiatives in such a way that they can quicklycome to understand them and be in a good position to make decisions about how thesemight improve their situations.The fourth strand is the process of ongoing engagement with Maori.Underpinning a stronger strategic focus is the varied and important role Maorigroups and parents can play in improving achievement, and the place of ongoingrelationship management and engagement with Maori in supporting this. This iscertainly a key priority for the Ministry and, no doubt, one for schools and for other 25526 education providers as well. The engagement has to be two-way, and it should maintaina sense of balance and perspective. It should also be about adding value to the process.Links with tribal and pan-tribal organisations are important, as are the links withmore local sub tribal groups. For the Ministry, it is important to ensure the messagesbeing conveyed are understood and supported in the Maori aims and networks of theCrown education agencies.The fifth and final element is about achieving more effective social policycoherence.A key strand in the way Government needs to work is by getting bettercoherence in social policy developments across Health, Welfare, Employment, Housingand Education. The Strengthening Families policy is an important attempt to ensure theefforts of Health, Welfare and Education can be better targeted at the most at-risk of allfamilies in the country. Housing and Employment and, to some extent, Welfare have aneffect on the quality of family life and, in particular, the amount of time and resourcesparents are able to give to their children. But, so does education.Strengthening parenting skills through parent programmes and adult literacyprogrammes would be an important part of building up the capability of families to helpchildren to learn. For teachers to be able to do things effectively, their initial preparationis very important. Having the confidence and basic understanding to be able to workwith a range of different parents and students, with a range of different expectationsand demands, is an important quality to develop, as is knowing how to go about gettingproblems solved, especially the more complicated ones dealing with local politics andleadership.In policy development, the Ministry has been focused on changing how wethink about Maori aspirations and concerns. This is particularly relevant to the moredetailed design of policy and the need to get more effective uptake of policies on theground.Our thinking and advice now puts more emphasis on the need to move awayfrom \"one-size-fits-all\" ways of thinking to approaches that put greater emphasis onaccommodating local solutions to local needs and strengths.The Ministry acknowledges the need to work much more closely with Maoriparents and communities, and to be listening to those communities. Such receptivity isbeing reflected in our approach to schooling improvement initiatives in areas of theTuhoe, Ngati Manawa and Ngati Porou tribes.268256 If social policies in multiple domains are communicated carefully, there will belonger-term and more durable gains. It implies that more time spent in developing andshaping policies can see the gains coming faster through more effective interventionsonce decisions are taken.This does raise some issues:In practice, the process of building relationships and gaining trust is a timeconsuming and gradual one. This process creates some tensions and trade-offsbetween the need for getting things done in a hurry and the need for good buy-inby the local community and schools.Moving to more local solutions brings the benefits of greater local involvement andcontrol, but does mean an expectation of greater levels of assurance andaccountability regarding the effective delivery of policy on the ground. Suchaccountability is particularly necessary where the Ministry and Maori communities,or umbrella organizations, are prepared to consider more \"wholesale\" arrangementsfor the local delivery of services.There are also practical issues relating to the Ministry's capability to invest in aworthwhile and meaningful way with all potential Maori stakeholders. As moretribes look to become involved in education, our ability to support the developmentof these can become very stretched and a possible source of frustration.We find that a clearer understanding of our respective responsibilities and thedifferent pressures and constraints we each face is vital. In developing localsolutions for local situations, we need to rely on people with informed localknowledge and an understanding from them of what is needed for policies to makea real difference in their communities. For example, Te Runanga o Ngati Porou(Ngati Porou Tribal Trust) will always know more about its people than the Ministry.The same goes for other tribes and Maori groups. The Ministry has its\"constituencies\" to manage in terms of persuading other agencies and Ministers toadopt new approaches. Like schools, we have much to contribute, but we need toshape and adapt our contributions through listening and enhancing thecontributions of others.Supporting and enabling schools to better respond to the needs of MaoristudentsThe majority of Maori students are educated in mainstream schools. Maorirepresentation on boards of trustees continues to be much lower than would be 257269 indicated by overall population trends. The schooling improvement initiatives confirmthat many schools and communities find it hard, in practice, to develop good workingrelationships with Maori communities.The voluntary involvement of the Maori community in helping schools withMaori culture and language and with Maori children, generally, is a unique arrangementin the New Zealand education system. These arrangements clearly work best whenMaori are involved from the beginning and not simply brought in after problems haveemerged.Clearly, in some cases, there are excellent examples of ways in which schools,teachers and communities have been able to develop approaches to improve educationaloutcomes. However, too often, it seems difficult for Maori to become involved in the lifeof the school or for schools to find ways of effectively engaging with the parents ofyoung Maori.The consultations around the strategy mentioned before confirm that manyparents do not feel empowered in their relationships with schools. A consistent themefrom the consultations was a demand for schools to be more accountable for theirservices to Maori. Many expressed a concern that they did not have a clearunderstanding of what they should expect their children to achieve at school, nor didthey get good information to judge the progress of their children.On the other hand, Maori parents were also talking about what they needed todo to better support their children in school. Effective parent participation would requireboth schools and the parents to think seriously about how they could be doing this workbetter. It means that schools would have to take the Maori community on board, thatresources and expertise would be allocated to meet certain objectives, and that therewould be regular reporting to parents about progress. More importantly, it would haverequired the professional leadership in the school to develop, in association with theparents, a medium- to long-term plan about where they needed to be heading, based ona good assessment of where they were now, how they were going to get there and withwhat resources, systems and processes, and how they would know they were on theright track.Within the development of a more strategic approach, we see merit indeveloping examples, guidance and information that would assist schools andcommunities to be more supportive and more responsive to each other, to be able to sitdown together and plan these things in a collective sense, not only sharing in the270258 difficult parts, but also in the joys of achievement and progress.Expectations about the TreatyThe Treaty settlement process has raised the awareness that many Maori wantto take more control over their own development, and to see references to the Treatybuilt much more explicitly into policy and administrative settings.The consultation on the strategy brought out a number of differences as to thepractical application of the Treaty in the design and administration of education policies.Within the range of views expressed was a general view that Maori and the Crown mustbe working together.The Ministry's approach has been a practical one, rather than one centred onaddressing constitutional issues. It has focused on:providing general support for policies that are more enabling of diversity andincreasing the quality of information and responsiveness that providers makeavailable to their student and parent communities;a much stronger focus on building relationships and consultation, and gettingalongside different Maori groups in a collaborative sense to help get the job done.It also supports what many schools are doing;recognising the importance of building a stronger Maori dimension into all that wedo and generally increasing the overall responsiveness of the Ministry to Maori;seeing the need to \"close the gap\" as one of our key strategic priorities. Within thiscontext, a strong emphasis is being placed on the interface between education andsocial and other policies directed at students and families at risk;a willingness to look positively at solutions that lie \"outside the box.\" In doing this,however, we still look rigorously at the factors and issues that must be made rightfor such approaches to work.Such approaches do have implications for Maori. For example, in supportingMaori to take control of an education initiative or programme, we would be looking forthem to manage the resources and capabilities, and take responsibility for the risks.The Ministry, though, is also conscious that it cannot rely on local Maoriorganisations, which often have few resources, to pick up additional responsibilitieswithout some support. Importantly, consideration needs to be made about the kind ofresources a school, community and the Ministry could be contributing when helping tostrengthen relationships and improve education.271259 ConclusionI have tried to draw out what some of the important considerations are inthinking about a much more strategic way to address Maori education concerns and therole officials can play to help promote this. We haven't got all the answers yet, andwe're probably a long way from this, but we've got some important things to moveforward on. The Ministry knows it can improve the core of what it does better andsmarter ways of communicating; smarter ways of developing and implementing policyand effecting a better return from existing policies; better across the board coordinationand integration and creating and maintaining healthy, positive and trusting relationshipswith Maori. The latter focused on devolving more authority for co-ordination andintegration to Maori in partnership with the Government.We know that schools can make a difference, but it takes a lot of dedication,good leadership, effort, and understanding, and we know that the role of parents in thiseffort is critical. We also know that socio-economic and family resource factors have aconsiderable impact on outcomes, but we know of situations where schools and teachershave been able to overcome these factors.The Ministry is committed to taking the step that has eluded many before toproduce a strategy which will give a greater level of assurance and confidence that therewill be increased benefits for Maori in all parts of the education system. But, we must dothis together, understanding the overall direction and the fact that Maori will choose anumber of different pathways to reach their destinations. Their control of thesepathways, with the Government's support, will be the essential element in making thiswork. 260 Education and Renewal in Aboriginal Nations:Highlights of the Report of the Royal Commissionon Aboriginal PeopleslMarlene Brant Castellano IntroductionThe theme of the International Summer Institute is Aboriginal Education andSelf-Government. These two aspects of Aboriginal development are often treated asseparate sectors and I am happy to see them converge in these discussions, as they didin the work of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP). In these pages, Ipropose to highlight the pivotal place that education occupies throughout the RCAPReport.I begin with an introduction to RCAP's mandate and the overall thrust of itsanalysis and recommendations. I then outline the role of education in achieving thefundamental changes proposed in the areas of governance, economic participation,social and cultural revitalization, and renewing the relationship between Aboriginal andnon-Aboriginal peoples. Finally, I offer some comment on the impact, to this date, ofthe Commission's recommendations on education.Mandate of RCAPThe Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was established by order of theGovernment of Canada in August 1991. The creation of the Commission wasprecipitated by the reaction of Canadians to armed confrontations between Aboriginalpeople and the Canadian state at Oka, Quebec in 1990. Canadians maintain an image ofthemselves as peacekeepers to the world. They were appalled that longstanding,festering conflict over Mohawk lands, targeted for the development of a golf course,could lead to the deployment of tanks, helicopters and sharpshooters against a smallband of self-styled warriors, youths and women barricaded for weeks in a treatmentcentre. Public opinion prodded the Canadian government to pursue a different path toresolving deepening conflict with the Aboriginal population.After extensive consultation carried out by Brian Dickson, former Chief Justiceof the Supreme Court, the Prime Minister appointed seven prominent Canadians, four of 26173 them Aboriginal persons, to serve on the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.RCAP was given a comprehensive mandate covering the history of relationships betweenAboriginal people and the Canadian government and Canadian society as a whole,treaties, self-government, lands, economy, justice, social and cultural issues in short,the whole gamut of Aboriginal experience. It would take five years and 58 milliondollars to fulfill the mandate.Commissioners listened attentively to more than 2,000 presentations fromindividuals and organizations, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, at public hearings incommunity halls, conference hotels, prisons and hockey arenas across Canada. Funds tosupport the preparation of briefs by Aboriginal organizations were secured anddistributed. Over 350 research projects were commissioned. The output of all theseactivities was channeled into a computerized information system with sophisticatedsoftware to assist teams of analysts and writers in searching out the crux of multipleproblems and solutions grounded in the wisdom and resourcefulness of Aboriginal andnon-Aboriginal peoples alike.The RCAP Report (RCAP, 1996) was submitted to the Prime Minister andreleased to the public in November 1996. It encompassed 3,500 pages in five volumesand made 440 recommendations, covering every aspect of the Commission's extensivemandate. The Report went beyond analysis of a so-called \"Aboriginal problem\" andchallenged not only the government, but all Canadians to consider a \"contradiction atthe heart of Canada.\" In the words of the Commission:In the minds of people across the globe, Canada has come to represent thehighest ideals of freedom and respect for human rights....Our country hasbecome a model for the world in many ways, yet the fundamentalcontradiction of building a modern democracy upon the subversion ofAboriginal nations and at the expense of the cultural identity of Aboriginalpeoples continues to undermine our society. As a Commission, we see thiscontradiction manifest itself in harmful ways in Aboriginal communities, andwe recognize the basic threat it poses to the legitimacy of Canadianinstitutions\" (RCAP, 1996, 1:607).Aboriginal people, who worked with the Commission, at times gave vent toanxiety that, with so much expertise applied to so many issues, we were in danger, onceagain, of finding our lives carved up into bureaucratic definitions of specific \"problems,\"violating a fundamental premise of Aboriginal philosophies that everything is related.The genius of the Report, giving expression to the vision of the seven commissioners, isthat it places relationship at the core of its agenda, then carefully delineates the 2 7 4262 interconnectedness of changes that are required to renew the relationship betweenAboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in Canada.Renewing the RelationshipThe language of renewal flows from the view of history set out by RCAP inVolume 1 of its Report: Looking Forward, Looking Back. This view acknowledgesAboriginal perspectives that experience can be seen as a recurring cycle in which oldtruths take on new meaning as they are experienced in emerging contexts. Thus thestruggle to assert the vitality of Aboriginal cultures and economies and the efficacy ofdistinctly Aboriginal forms of government is a new phenomenon. At the same time, itrepresents the renewed expression of ancient knowledge and capacity.The historical framework within which RCAP situates its findings sets out fourstages in the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples (RCAP, 1996,1:36-40). The first stage is that of separate worlds, a period when Aboriginal nationslived on their traditional territories, harvesting the riches of the land and operating tradenetworks. Colonial records from the time of early contact confirm oral traditions of firstpeoples that their societies were self-regulating and self-reliant, maintaining remarkablygood health and orderly social relations.The second historical stage was that of contact and cooperation extending,with regional variations, roughly from 1500 to 1800. While not entirely free of conflict,this period was marked by increasingly frequent contact, the establishment of trade andmilitary alliances, intermarriage and mutual cultural exchange and adaptation.The third stage, designated \"displacement and assimilation,\" extended from theearly 1800s to the issuance of the Statement of the Government of Canada on IndianPolicy (The White Paper) in 1969. The non-Aboriginal population became dominantnumerically and politically. Aggressive policies to assimilate Aboriginal people into theEuro-Canadian mainstream included relocations, residential schooling, imposition ofelected forms of government under the Indian Act, and outlawing of Aboriginal culturalpractices.The fourth stage, in which we now find ourselves, is \"negotiation and renewal.\"This stage was initiated with the rejection of the federal government's White Paperwhich sought to make Indians \"citizens like any others,\" terminating treaties and reservelands, and removing all distinctiveness of status and federal obligations with respect toAboriginal peoples. The period has been marked by political activism and overtresistance, which occasionally takes on ominous overtones as in the Oka crisis.275263 Landmark judgements of the Supreme Court of Canada, and the emerging voice ofIndigenous peoples in forums supported by the United Nations, have played a part inpressuring the Canadian government to enter into dialogue with Aboriginal communitiesand organizations.The Commission's analysis and its numerous recommendations are directed todealing with the legacy of the period when public policies supported displacement andassimilation, systematically undermining Aboriginal institutions of governance andeconomy and the social/cultural cohesion of communities. The RCAP Report argues thatrestoring vitality to Aboriginal nations and their communities requires fundamentalchange on several fronts. We must regain the authority to make decisions thatdetermine the conditions of our lives this is self-government. We must re-establishviable economies that reflect our values and ways of dealing with one another this iseconomic self-reliance. We must strengthen our health and skills and self-confidence sothat we can meet our responsibilities to ourselves and all our relations this is holistichealing. And, because we share this land with people of other origins, we must forge anew relationship characterized by mutual recognition, respect, sharing and responsibility(RCAP, 1996, 1:675-697).Each of these aspects of renewal is connected to all the others, like the fourquadrants of a medicine wheel converging to form a balanced whole. Self-governmentwill be an illusion without the resources and economic base to support it. Economic self-reliance requires healthy, skilled people and a fairer sharing of lands and opportunity inrelation to other peoples in Canada. Healing of body, mind, feelings and spirit willliberate people to become self-determining and self-reliant, but the path to healing willnot be easy to follow unless decision-making and resources are brought under Aboriginalcontrol. The challenge set out by RCAP is not only to recognize the interdependencebetween the elements of renewal, but also to set in motion dynamic, synergistic change,so that a positive cycle of development occurs. RCAP calls for a twenty-yearcommitment to renewal, to be launched by a royal proclamation and companionlegislation marking clear pathways to change (RCAP, 1996, 5:20-21).Lifelong Holistic EducationEducation has a central role to play in translating the Commission's visionaryrecommendations into reality. Education goes by different names. When we speak ofmovement toward self-government we call it \"capacity-building.\" When we discuss76264 economic development we use the terms \"human resource development\" or \"training.\"When we set out to change attitudes and perceptions that shape relations betweenpeoples, we speak of \"public education,\" and when we consider the responsibility ofpreparing the next generation to be contributing members of the community, we use theterm \"education\" or \"schooling.\" Aboriginal people speak of education as a lifelong,holistic process that begins while a child is still in the womb and continues so long as aperson draws breath, encompassing all those !earnings that we need to live long andwell on Mother Earth (Castellano et al., 2000:1).Education, in this comprehensive sense, is woven through every section of theRCAP Report. As the Commission addressed means of implementing its agenda forchange, it articulated the knowledge, attitudes and skills required to renew therelationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in Canada.Education and Self-GovernmentThe Commission concluded that all Aboriginal peoples of Canada, including FirstNations, Inuit and Metis peoples, have a right of self-determination that is founded inemerging norms of international law, recognized in historic treaties and protected by theCanadian Constitution. By virtue of this right, Aboriginal peoples are entitled tonegotiate freely the terms of their relationship with Canada and to establishgovernmental structures that they consider appropriate for their needs (RCAP, 1996,2:173). The right of self-determinaticp, and its expression in self-government, is vestedin nations rather than individual communities or administrative units under the IndianAct, a nation being defined as \"a sizeable body of Aboriginal people with a shared senseof national identity that constitutes the predominant population in a certain territory orcollection of territories\" (RCAP, 1996, 2:178).The Commission states firmly that Aboriginal nations can exercise their inherentright of self-government without consulting federal or provincial authorities. However,agreement between neighbouring governments is the preferred route. While self-government arrangements are being worked out, the Commission urges federal,provincial and territorial governments to move promptly to acknowledge the jurisdictionof Aboriginal nations. This would open the way to self-starting Aboriginal initiatives,greater flexibility in the interpretation of existing law, recognition of the capacity of off-reserve organizations to act on behalf of their membership, and making fiscalarrangements between Aboriginal and Canadian governments commensurate with theresponsibilities undertaken. Education is implicated as a consequence of self-government and as anessential support to its attainment. It is identified by the Commission as a core area ofjurisdiction within which Aboriginal nations can exercise their inherent right. However,education reform should not be delayed while full self-government is being negotiated.Recommendations are designed to be implemented under present federal, provincial andterritorial law, or in the transition to self-government, or under Aboriginal self-government.Citing research from the Yukon and, as of 1996, the anticipated territory ofNunavut, the Commission noted that training provisions in claims processes weretypically scheduled to take effect once agreements were concluded, a timetable that wasinadequate to meet the explosive demands for trained personnel that were in prospect.In the territories, examination of existing and anticipated jobs indicated that high schooland college programs might serve to fill administrative support positions in organizationsinvolved in implementing self-government, but there was an urgent need to trainprogram administrators, senior executives and other professionals. Preparation ofcommunity members to serve on boards and committees directing implementation ofagreements was also essential. The Commission concluded that education for self-government had to be addressed to two distinct groups: those currently employed inlocal administration and regional organizations, and a large population of youth whowould be entering the labour force in the next two decades. These groups have distinct,sometimes overlapping, educational needs which include on-the-job training,professional development, job leaves, distance education and in-community studyopportunities, as well as more conventional methods of education in regional and urbancentres. Students require adequate financial support for academic and subsistenceneeds, including family responsibilities. On the delivery side, it cannot be assumed thatAboriginal self-government jobs will be identical to those in other governmentorganizations. Adapted training programs will be required. One-stop fundingmechanisms for education and training were recommended to replace the fragmentedapproach of program funding involving multiple government departments and programs,each with its own mandate and guidelines.Education for Economic Self-relianceThe skills required for participation in a rapidly changing, global economy arekey ingredients in a strategy of economic renewal and increased self-reliance forAboriginal nations and their communities. The Aboriginal population is young and278266 growing rapidly. 1991 census figures indicated that 56 per cent of the Aboriginalpopulation was under 24 years of age, compared with 35 per cent of the generalpopulation. With thousands of new entrants to the labour force each year, theCommission estimated that just under 225,000 jobs would have to be created toaccommodate the rapidly growing labour force over the next 20 years. In addition,there is a large gap in unemployment rates between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginalpeople. To bridge this gap, another 82,400 jobs would be needed yielding an overalladditional requirement of 307,300 jobs in the period 1991-2016 to achieve equitablelevels of employment for Aboriginal people relative to Canadian employment norms(RCAP, 1996, 2:931).The Commission sets out a multi-pronged economic development strategy thatincludes entrepreneurship, circulation of economic benefits within local Aboriginalcommunities, and support of mixed economies that recognize the contribution ofharvesting activities on traditional lands. Self-government will open job opportunities, asalready noted, and land claims settlements that provide an infusion of capital and royaltypayments for resource development that will boost Aboriginal economies in someregions. However, the vast majority of the new jobs required will have to be found inthe labour market. It is estimated that nearly half (45 per cent) of new jobs beingcreated will require post-secondary education (HRDC, 1994).The absolute numbers of Aboriginal youth graduating from secondary schooland continuing to post-secondary education have increased in the present generation.Significant numbers of adults are returning to school as highly motivated maturelearners who achieve good success rates. 1996 census figures reveal that educationlevels of Aboriginal people are rising, but attainment in the general Canadian populationis rising faster. Between 1981 and 1996, the proportion of Aboriginal people withuniversity degrees rose from 2.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent. In the same period, theproportion of non-Aboriginal people holding degrees rose from 9.9 per cent to 15.6 percent, increasing the gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal attainment from 7 percent to 11 per cent. Increasing disparity is similarly found in completions of technicaland college programs. Aboriginal completions have remained steady at around 12.5 percent, while non-Aboriginal completions have risen from 19.8 per cent in 1986 to 24.5 percent in 1996 (Statistics Canada in Castellano et al., 2000: 225).As a central component of its employment development strategy RCAPrecommended that: 2672 7 9 Federal and provincial governments fund a major 10-year initiative foremployment development and training that is:aimed at preparing Aboriginal people for much greater participation inemerging employment opportunities;sponsored by Aboriginal nations or regionally-based Aboriginal institutions;developed in collaboration with public and private sector employers andeducational and training institutions; andmandatory for public sector employers.The initiative would include:identification of future employment growth by sector;classroom and on-the-job training for emerging employment opportunities;term employment with participating employers; andpermanent employment based on merit.Education and HealingHealing is a term often used by Aboriginal people to signify the restoration ofphysical, social, emotional and spiritual vitality in individuals and social systems. Itechoes, in many ways, the concept of continuous growth and learning implied in holisticeducation. Chief Gordon Peters, speaking to the Commission described it thus:Across the board a lot is going on right now. It is given different names andtakes shape in different circumstances. Some call it healing; some call itregeneration. No matter what it is called, it is the same process peopletaking control of their individual lives (RCAP Hearings: Toronto, 18 November1993). In Volume 2: Gathering Strength, the RCAP Report documents the numerousaccomplishments of reform efforts in Aboriginal education in the years since themilestone paper Indian Control of Indian Education was published (National IndianBrotherhood, 1972). First Nations and Inuit parents and communities have assumedcontrol of local school administration and influenced the content of curriculum, althoughstandard provincial curricula still dominate in federal or First Nation schools. Aboriginalteacher education programs have gained support and have increased the number ofAboriginal teachers, but the gains have largely been confined to representation inelementary schools. Provincial education ministries and school boards have developedprograms to make provincial and local institutions more welcoming and responsive toAboriginal participation. Tribal councils and regional governments are assumingresponsibility for policy and planning in education. Aboriginal institutions across Canada280268 offer adult and post-secondary programs, mostly through affiliation agreements withprovincial colleges and universities, producing outstanding results in student retention,graduation rates and subsequent employment (RCAP, 1996, 3:561).All of these changes are welcome but they fall short of the efforts necessary tonarrow the gap between the educational attainment of Aboriginal people and that ofothers in Canada. As the skill requirements of a post-industrial, globalized economy rise,there is the serious and disturbing prospect that the marginalization, poverty and relativedisadvantage of Aboriginal people will worsen.The 44 recommendations in the Education chapter of Volume 3 touch oneducation strategies for children, youth, adults and Elders. They place strong emphasison early childhood education, making available high quality, culturally appropriate, earlychildhood education guided by parental and community choice. Recommendations onelementary and secondary schooling echo recommendations from reports written overthe past 25 years. They are directed to both Aboriginal schools on reserve andprovincial schools, which 80 per cent of Aboriginal students are estimated to attend.They emphasize Aboriginal involvement in governance of education whether on reserveor in cities and towns, the development of culturally appropriate curriculum, expansionof Aboriginal teacher training, and recognition of the importance of conserving andrevitalizing Aboriginal languages.A recommendation on education to empower Aboriginal youth illustrates theattention given to detailing implementation strategies:The Commission recommends that:Aboriginally controlled, provincial, and territorial schools serving Aboriginalyouth develop and implement comprehensive Aboriginal youth empowermentstrategies with elements elaborated in collaboration with youth, including:(a) cultural education in classroom and informal settings;(b) acknowledgement of spiritual, ethical and intuitive dimensions of learning;(c) education to support critical analysis of Aboriginal experience;(d) learning as a means of healing from the effects of trauma, abuse andracism;(e) academic skills development and support;(f)sports and outdoor education;(g) leadership development; and(h) youth exchanges between Aboriginal nations, across Canada and281269 internationally (RCAP, 1996, 3:485).The major recommendations for adult and post-secondary education focus onbringing stable, adequate funding and credential-granting mandates to Aboriginal post-secondary institutions which now struggle for resources on the fringes of provincialcollege and university systems. An Aboriginal Peoples' International University isproposed to link regional efforts, develop accreditation criteria, and provide a focus fornegotiating recognition of credentials by mainstream institutions.Recommendations on Elders in education reiterate recommendations of pastreports on engaging them in appropriate ways in youth education. Support forexchanges between Elders from different locations and traditions, and dialogue withmainstream scholars is also supported.The central thrust of the RCAP recommendations on education is that federal,provincial and territorial governments should acknowledge that education is a core areafor the exercise of Aboriginal self-government, and that they should collaborate withAboriginal governments, organizations or education authorities, as appropriate, tosupport the development of Aboriginally controlled education systems, with fundingcommensurate with the responsibilities assumed (RCAP, 1996, 3:444). Enlarging thespace for Aboriginal initiatives and stabilizing support for Aboriginal institutions will, inturn, influence the quality and effectiveness of education that will continue to beprovided by provincial and territorial institutions, offering models and benchmarks forinstitutional performance.Public Education for a Renewed RelationshipIn putting forward its challenge to renew the relationship between Aboriginaland non-Aboriginal peoples, the Commission wrote:We have no illusions about the difficulties standing in the way of negotiations torenew the relationship. Efforts at reform, whether in political relationships orsocial policies over the past 25 years, have failed repeatedly to effectsubstantial change....How do participants move away from a relationship characterized by disparityin power, violations of trust, and lingering, unresolved disputes? How do theymove toward a relationship of power sharing, mutual respect, and jointproblem solving?It is our conviction that appreciation of the distinctive place that Aboriginalnations occupy in the Canadian federation, and of the mutual, continuingresponsibilities engendered by that relationship, must permeate Canadianintellectual and ceremonial life (RCAP, 1996, 1:6,7,8).282270 The first initiative proposed by the Commission to transform the relationshipwas a royal proclamation acknowledging the errors of past treatment of Aboriginalpeoples and making a commitment to embark on a new path. The proclamation wouldbe accompanied by legislation to give substance institutionally to new forms ofrelationship in new and renovated treaties and accords, and nation-to-nationtransactions. However, change in a democratic society does not come about bygovernment fiat. To be sustained, change in public policy must be supported by publicawareness and endorsement of the path taken.Throughout its life, the Commission made public communication of its missionand activities a priority. In Volume 5: Renewa/: A Twenty-Year Commitment, it set out aprogram of public education that included: a task force to communicate findings andpromote study and implementation of the Report; distribution of the CD-ROM For SevenGenerations, An Information Legacy of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples(RCAP 1997); greater acknowledgement of Aboriginal place names, languages,ceremonies and historic sites in public life; and making public education an integral partof all programs that affect Aboriginal people. An aspect of public education givenparticular emphasis in the body of the Report was dissemination of the concepts thattreaties with Aboriginal nations are fundamental to the make-up of Canada and that theirfulfillment is a test of Canada's honour and place of respect in the family of nations.Another recommendation was for the establishment of an Aboriginal Peoples ReviewCommission that would provide a mechanism for governments to evaluate progress inimplementing the recommendations of RCAP and establish a means of reporting to thepublic on actions and effectiveness in achieving a new relationship.Responses to RCAPAboriginal organizations generally made positive responses to the RCAP Report,though they reserved the right to study and adapt recommendations to their owncircumstances and their self-defined priorities. The initial response of the federalgovernment was decidedly cool. The Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs (INAC) in1996, the Honourable Ron Irwin, judged the overall recommendations too costly andindicated that his department was already working on specific issues identified in theReport. Minister Jane Stewart, who assumed the portfolio after the federal election inJune 1997, was more positive. In various venues she acknowledged the profoundchallenge put forward by the Commission: 271283 We first need to understand that, over and above hundreds of individualrecommendations, the Commissioners directed us to examine the very core ofhow we have lived together in this country (Stewart, 1998:2).Gathering Strength - Canada's Aboriginal Action PlanIn January 1998, the Government of Canada made a formal ceremonialresponse to the RCAP Report. It began with a Statement of Reconciliation in whichMinister Stewart, on behalf of the government, expressed to all Aboriginal people inCanada \"profound regret for past actions of the federal government which havecontributed to these difficult pages in the history of our relationship together.\" To thosewho suffered sexual and physical abuse at residential schools, the Minister declared: \"Weare deeply sorry.\" The statement also expressed the intention to \"find ways in whichAboriginal people can participate fully in the economic, political, cultural and social life ofCanada in a manner which preserves and enhances the collective identities of Aboriginalcommunities, and allows them to evolve and flourish in the future\" (Canada, 1998).The policy statement released at the same time was titled \"Gathering StrengthCanada's Aboriginal Action Plan.\" It committed the Government of Canada to renewthe partnership to better the lives of Aboriginal people in Canada; to strengthenAboriginal governance so that communities can exercise their inherent right of self-government; to design a new fiscal relationship to provide a stable flow of funds insupport of community development; and to sustain the growth of strong, healthyAboriginal communities through economic development, infrastructure and services. Inaddition to the foregoing statements of regret and future intent, the one substantivecommitment announced at the time was a fund in the amount of $350 million topromote healing of the legacy of physical and sexual abuse at residential schools(Stewart, 1998:5).Closely paralleling the commitments in Gathering Strength was the Agenda forAction with First Nations developed in consultation between INAC and the Assembly ofFirst Nations (AFN), also released in January 1998. The latter document has provided aframework for a working partnership over the subsequent two years.Searching for Signs of ChangeThree years have passed since release of the RCAP Report. Has it made adifference? There is evidence that the Report has exerted significant influence onrelations between the federal government and First Nations' organizations, particularlythe AFN. Inuit self-government gained prominence in 1999 with the creation of4r)84272 Nunavut, a development that proceeded relatively independent of RCAPrecommendations. The Metis and Aboriginal people living off-reserve report littleprogress in their efforts to gain recognition of their distinctive status, historic claims andservice needs (Castellano, 1999:107).The following comments focus on education initiatives specific to First Nations,in part because this is the arena where I have had some involvement, but also becausethis is where government follow-up of the RCAP Report has been focussed.In an overview of policy discourse on Aboriginal affairs from1965 to 1992,Graham et al. (1996) concluded:The federal government is still the dominant power in thegovernment/Aboriginal relationship. What means do Aboriginal peoples haveto initiate dialogue that would compel governments to participate? Thecontrolling party can choose who participates, how they participate, and whatoptions are available ... Aboriginal groups are left to react to, and cope with,this process, recommend changes that the government is in no waycompelled to consider, and, if time and money permit, seek redress throughthe courts (pp. 349-350).Measures led or supported by government to implement RCAP'srecommendations on education and the commitments in principle set out in GatheringStrength and the Agenda for Action have been extremely modest. In 1998-99, $8million was earmarked to support goals congruent with RCAP recommendations for childand youth education. On AFN's recommendation, the entire amount was directed toregional activities. Funds were accessed through competitive proposal submissions, inwhich 38 proposals were successful. $26 million was allocated in 1999-2000, againaccessed in the regions through a proposal submission process. In 2000-2001, thebudget will rise to $40 million and INAC and AFN will engage in dialogue to consideralternative options for distribution (Tremblay, 1999:7). Delivery costs of elementary,secondary and post-secondary education operations are budgeted separately, totaling$1.263 billion which is 29 per cent of INAC's budget of $4.387 billion for the Indian andInuit Affairs Program in 1999-2000 (INAC, 1999).In effect, response to RCAP recommendations for system change in educationhas been relegated to the status of a departmental program with a modest budget,accessible to a small number of First Nation communities. In contrast, the agenda forchange mandated by resolution of Assembly of First Nations chiefs continues to press forlegislation recognizing First Nations jurisdiction, funding allocations consistent withpopulation growth, systematic planning to address unmet needs for special education of 27e8 5 First Nations students, and accreditation of First Nation post-secondary institutions. Inadvocating for system change, AFN chiefs consistently cite RCAP recommendations tosupport their position (AFN 1998).Federal initiatives relating to First Nations are proceeding in other departmentsas well. The Head Start program incorporating early childhood education is sponsoredby Health Canada; a Youth Employment Strategy and adult training are providedthrough Human Resources Development Canada; and $20 million has been allocated byHeritage Canada over four years, beginning in 1998-99, to maintain and revitalizeAboriginal languages.In virtually all program areas affecting First Nations, the AFN is involved inconsultations on policy although program decisions, such as those that requirecompetitive proposals from First Nations communities and regional organizations forlimited funds, may be problematic for AFN. Further, when incremental funding forGathering Strength initiatives is fixed on an annual basis, AFN must make difficultchoices internally. As a staff member pointed out: \"If we press too hard for educationpriorities, it may mean that something equally important, like housing, loses\" (PauletteTremblay, Personal Communication).A performance report published on the Internet by INAC stresses \"partnershipbased on mutual respect and recognition, responsibility and sharing.\" The establishmentof the Aboriginal Healing Foundation to deal with the legacy of physical and sexual abusein residential schools and an Aboriginal language program are cited, but the contours of\"a public education campaign to teach all Canadians about Aboriginal culture andhistory\" and \"a capacity-building program to help Aboriginal organizations\" remain vague(INAC 1999). An analysis by Fred Wien (1999) of initiatives in the area of economicdevelopment, including training, concluded that \"the scale of the effort is notcommensurate with the dimensions of the issue or with the Commission'srecommendations\" (p. 269).ConclusionIt should be evident from this brief review that the education recommendationsof the RCAP Report have not achieved a high priority either in federal governmentresponse to the Report, or in public lobbying by representative Aboriginal organizations,despite the fact that education of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people is pivotal to theachievement of goals in every sector. Developments in treaty negotiations in BritishColumbia and the announcement of private sector participation in a Human Resources286274 Development Council have had a higher profile. The plight of homeless Aboriginalpeople and, shamefully, news of abuses of Aboriginal human rights by police havecaptured the attention of the media at least briefly, but inertia in the large, expensiveAboriginal education machine has not generated the outrage or shame that seemsnecessary to trigger movement.There are larger numbers of Aboriginal educators than ever before, and moreAboriginal students attaining higher education and professional qualifications, but thegap between poor and rich, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal educational levels growswider. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples has dissolved, its mandatecompleted. Aboriginal organizations labour on, bringing the issues of theirconstituencies before governments who weigh their requests in the light of conservativefiscal priorities. And it is left to citizens of good will to hold governments to their publiccommitments to a partnership with Aboriginal peoples based on mutual respect andrecognition, responsibility and sharing.I am pleased to have been a part of the Summer Institute, Voice of the Drum,which has served to disseminate knowledge of the mutual benefits of such a partnershipof peoples and to reinforce the commitment of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal citizens, inCanada and abroad, to make that partnership a reality.

RESPECTFULLY ENDORSED BY VOTE AND CONSENSUS of the Delegates, July 16,1998 at noon. 293 281 Elder's CommentsEd OnabigonTalk transcribed by Roger Neil Thunder Bay, OntarioFebruary 25 & 26, 2000 I'm grateful for us choosing this nice spot here on the Fort William Reserve, bythe causeway, just looking over the lake all this beauty that the Creator has given us,Lake Superior. Looking out to the southwest, there's this big island.(Looking at this book) I like what Marie Eshkibok-Trudeau had to say, whereshe was relating everything to the circle, which is so much a part of our Anishnabe way.For us, really, to be part of the education system, we have to own the curriculum. Oneway of doing this is following the principles and guidelines of the circle. Also, the sevenvirtues are very important. You know, when some of my siblings were being born, andnieces and nephews, the umbilical cord would be saved, to respect our connection toour parents, as well as our connection to the Creator. Eventually, this would be givenback to the earth. That cradleboard would be a place where the child learned learnedby watching everything that went on around he or she. Our first school, first education,comes from being in the cradlelbo\\ard, like the security of the womb. You would stillhave that secureness. And babies would have wrappings to sleep in; they would feelprotected. If we would start fashioning our education system on the basics of theoriginal circle teachings of the Anishnabe people (it would be good).Ask the Elders to show you the old ways, and adapt the principles that we hadway back when. Even our Native traditions and culture are forever changing. It's finethat we do the ceremonies, but we have changed, so we have to adapt; at the sametime, never forgetting where we come from. Respect, truth, honesty, all the goodseven teachings of the Seven Grandfathers, Grandmothers - with them, we rememberour basic connection to the Creator and his creation. This is the way it has to be. Justlike those trees, look at them, there's maybe fifty, sixty plants right in front of us. Butthey're all connected, they're all reaching out, and they never have to worry, they'reeach doing their job. So is each and every one of those blades of grass - they're294282 unique, they're all unique. If you take any two, they're not exactly the same, just aswith people. That shows us the harmony and balance, and that they adapt to theirenvironment. Man and woman have to do the same thing, adapt and see ourconnection to everything around us.(Regarding suffering and healing related to education) The thing is, we haveto grow out of that, we have to seek that healing. In my case, I went through racism,alcoholism, low self-worth; I didn't respect myself as a person. It wasn't until I startedgoing back and trying to find my roots, to find out who I was as an Anishnabe man, thatI finally began to appreciate what is here. I saw what non-Native society seemed tohave; I tried to chase that dream, but it wasn't my dream. But once I got serious andgot to appreciate myself as an Anishnbe person, I found an inner peace in being EdOnabigon, an Anishnabe man ... agood person, and able to love myself. Then, I wasable to teach people the little bit that I know about the circle of life. Today, right now,it is really a beautiful circle.I know my connection to everyone around me. I'mbeginning to reclaim my language, my Ojibwayness, my family. We are becomingwhole.It shows me that I'm on the right track when I can make a difference inpeople's lives...just caring for people and sharing with them, sharing whatever I havewith them that'll help to make their day. The main thing is to become whole.(Regarding having a dream and necessary sacrifice) Day by day, there'ssurrendering of self, just to surrender. In the past, I had my own little way of seeing,just like a horse when they have blinders on. I saw what I wanted to see, not how Ishould or could be. The way I surrendered that, and continue to surrender that to ourCreator, to wholeness and to health the more I get lifted up and feel connected toother people. Some old people, you can see that around them, they're just so peacefuland serene. Just like some of the great people like Mother Theresa, Ghandi, someElders that you might meet when you're travelling around - you can actually see theirgoodness. I would like to have just a bit of what they have, so I could be rememberedfor the good things that I've done, what I've contributed to society: the sweatlodge, thecircles, the ceremonies and so forth. Just being a good neighbour/citizen, walking inkindness. You know the Creator is kind; he's been kind to both of us, since we firstsundanced together at Heron Bay.(Regarding adolescents) They're just testing the water, trying to become theirown people, their own selves. One teenager that adopted me wanted to stay with me; I295283 just stuck by her, just as I learned from my mother and dad when I was going throughthat period. They just stood by me; no matter what I did, they would be so kind. Evenif I was stuck somewhere a hundred miles away, they'd send me bus fare or train fare,\"c'mon home.\" By being kind and supporting that youngster who adopted me, nomatter how angry I was at her actions, I just remembered how my parents treated mewhen I was becoming independent. Just continue to support and love your kids nomatter what, you've just got to take care of them. And, of course, as you go along,you're trying to be a good example to them, to provide good life skills.(Looking over a life of learning) The biggest thing is probably when I hit thebottom, really felt hopeless, contemplated jumping off a train bridge ...it was from thatpoint that I really started looking for \"Anishnabe Eddy,\" who I really am. Then, Istarted offering tobacco, attending ceremonies, started working at finding out who Ireally was. The first time I was out in the bush, in the middle of nowhere, looking for aplace to offer my tobacco, I still made sure no one was around watching me. It'samazing from a small beginning, from seeking help, how much can come to us. Youpick up teachings here and there; you know when lightning arrives the first time in theyear, offer tobacco.I did that, and later dreams came to help teach me. Then, everychance I got, I'd listen to Elders' teachings, and then, the pipe teaches you. I had onedream in which I knew I had permission to start using the pipe. The hand-drum, thetraditional big drum, the water drum here they're all gifts I carry now. Not for me,but these gifts are carried for the community and to make the circle strong. Themedicines are not for personal use, but always to serve the people. The Anishnabeword for this is \"helper\"to live with these gifts in simplicity and humility. The Creatorand the spirit helpers are what make the ceremonies so spiritual, so full of life.The drum is the heartbeat of the earth, the drum is the pulse of the Creator,the heartbeat of the Creator, it's all that. When we're first conceived in our mother'swomb, we are listening to the heartbeat of the drum. It can continue on through ourlives. When you attend ceremonies and you hear that drum, you feel that life, thatenergy, of the Creator filling the place. I attend mass too, and I get healing from myreligion too, especially the teachings of Christ. He reminds us that we are one spirit inGod. I've never seen anywhere where He says our culture is bad. Had the missionariesadapted their teachings to what was already here in the territory, there wouldn't havebeen the fear element. They had nothing good to say about the fine values we alreadyhad Had they really, truly been living Christian values, then none of this poverty and 284 hopelessness in Native communities would have happened. We would have beenincluded from day one as partners with the European people. Anishnabe teachings ofthe drum, the teachings of the pipe, the teachings of our ancestors - always teach usthe oneness of all creation with the Creator. It is the same teaching.When the Europeans first came over here, they held out basically the sameteachings as we already had this is why we embraced them as brothers and sisters.But, they didn't see that that was true; their attitude was \"In the name of God, yourculture is wrong; in the name of God, you're pagans.\" But this was never so in ourculture. We knew where we were in the order of Creation. This is why, now, no cultureshould be turned away from our Native ceremonies; otherwise, we are turning away oneof God's people from the ceremony and that would no longer be a sacred circle. Thecircle represents all people. Keep it whole, always whole. With that, it's good to bealive, it's good to share that.We're all working to restore.the balance on this earth, the harmony. This iswhat the teachings are: balance, harmony, life. The main thing is that we have to bekind. The word for \"the Creator\" in Ojibway is \"Gishe Manido\" the literal translation is\"kind Creator.\" In order for us to do the Creator's will, we have to be kind, kind to eachother. Then all other things come: the respect, the truth, the honesty, the whole seventeachings of the Grandfathers. We have to learn from creation. Learn to respect thetrees, the fish, the air, the fire, all the elements they're all a part of us. We have totake care of things. Everything is given to us to sustain life ... the spiritual, mental,physical, emotional, all of these have to be in balance in order to live a good life.Sure, there's storms in life, cloudy periods. We have to expect somehardships, but persevere and live through them because we know the sun will breakthrough. Without overanalyzing things, without always trying to figure things out, if youkeep things simple, the Creator works with you. Ever since I started having circles atthe Homeless Centre, there's already people who have reclaimed their life and aremoving on. That's the least I can do pass that hope on.(Regarding fear of the occult or bad medicine) If you buy into somefundamentalist views, that things are one way and that's it, then, naturally, fear is goingto start coming in. Don't allow fear to come in. If you really look at everything that'shere on this earth, it was made by the Creator, and the Creator made all things good.So the only bad medicine is our allowing fear to take over this is where bad medicinecomes in.If you let that grow in your mind, then, pretty soon, it overwhelms you. Look 2852 97 into your heart, that's where the Creator is, look to see everything around you fromthere. This is where respect comes in too you would choose the medicines that givelife. Whatever you move out of its place, use it in a good way. Bad medicine is only inthe mind, it can be overwhelming, but it is not a part of the spirit. Respect yourself,and trust in the Creator.(Concluding) We have to realize that we have a lot to offer, once we knowwho we are as First People, what our values are through the traditions. A lot of it isalive. The traditions are there and will remain forever. Our respect for the land ...never kill anything unless you need it, don't waste. All the years I trapped with my Dad,we could go back year after year. Each family of beaver would supply us with one ortwo beaver, what they could spare. There, we respect the spirit of the animals that weuse to keep us living. There is interference, like in the case of our trapline. My fatherhad taken care to preserve the trapline so we could go back year after year, and a bigfamily surviving on that. The government of Ontario, in its wisdom, brought in trappersfrom another area one year that my Dad was sick, and these men cleaned out thewhole trapline. Thirty years later, it's just beginning to regenerate. They should haverespected that land and not drained it out. Had it not been for the values taught to meby my parents, there could have been violence there. Really, every species has theirpart to play in the whole world. But that isn't book knowledge, it's knowledge that youlearn from the heart, and from observation. It's up to each individual to search out andfind your place in creation, to earn your knowledge, to earn respect. 298286 One More Thing An Anonymous Participant of the International Summer Institute Voice of the Drum Know that all of the memories are alive,Not one voice is lost foreverBut held in the loving embraceof our grandmothers and grandfathers:Full waves of lightning will stream up from the rockto join the stars with the earth ...from the bedrock, the molten womb, the iron crystal heartof this planet which holds all the memories of each day,each revolution around the sun.Somewhere deep within the earth a very old grandmotherwill decide that it is time to wake us up.She will take us in a waking dreambeside the lake, and gesture to the granite floor,and the floodgates will open.Every language and image and sign will flickerfrom the rocky vault of the Canadian shield into the night sky,and we will remember who we really areWe will speak with the tongues of ourgreat grandparents, and see with their eyes.In humility, there will be joy and evensilly laughter, to see the sadness andworry evaporate in the twinkling lightof the stars.In a quiet place there is a womanworking with peaceful concentration upona deerhide.Each crystal bead she sews upon the hideis infused with light and as it takes shapefinds life: there are trees and people and bears,eagles and moose and beaver. There! a beaded wolftakes hold of its place upon the hide, and slowlylifts its head before a moonlit beaded cedar.Oh, there is my family's history, shaped asit leaves the woman's hand. She is a beautiful 287299 young woman, yet changes to a white-hairedold sister, just as a waterfall rushes overwatery rocks, she is ageless in keeping thishide, this history.The drum beatsteady and deeply resonantreaches into the past, present and future:pulsing with medicinesthe drum is our heartbeat,a golden glow that always movesbeneath the surface of all that takes place.Everywhere there is war,The water is angry in industry's filthy embrace.Reptilian greed claws our childrenbloody and broken from the womband hides on the dark side of the moon.But streaming from the four directions,the sky is filled with legions of thunderbirdsyoung and old sacrificing lifeto restore peace and love.Soon, there will be small groupsof brothers and sisters softly talkingaround the fire in a tall pine forest;And taller yet, sixty feet tallstand their guardians:transparent turquoise in spirit,the guardians reach out from the rootof their three separate selvesto join in silent communion abovethe treeline. They see and hear andtouch hundreds of miles around them.They will protect each small grouparound the fire.In the second night of the sundanceThe sundancer sees the same thingwith eyes open or closed:A whirling circle of swallowseach emanating singing lightsweaving their circle, the swallows form awindow to the spirit place.Through the window is a lovely meadowgreen with summer sunAnd there in the distance stands a beautifulwhite buffalo grandmother.But wait, with pounding hooves, the red-eyedgrandfather, her partner, charges the sundancerand passes straight through into the night.300288 Now, with grace the lovely white buffalograndmother slowly approaches ...Her turquoise eyes are deep with love andunderstanding. Through her eyes and through the sacred tree,the sundancer meets his whole familyof many past generations.And deeper yet, through her eyes, the future.It is the end of this world, and the beginningof the next, all at once.There are thousands of buffalo streamingback to the earth,the waves of wind from their passagebeats fire and dust into the airFaster and faster in whirlwind force;time passes quickly outside thewhite buffalo grandmother's lodges:Ribbed lodges wherein green fields and people stillstand protected in slow-motion harmony.The drum is alive:Within the drum is a young manWho is holy and truecalling, reminding us of the seven virtuesfrom which all medicines stem.One morning in late fall,when white frost cracklesupon the garden path;Two cranes stand tall:As the old crane moves his headthe traveller's gaze is also movedtoward a bench in the coolsunlightat the end of the gardenJust then, standing one-legged, the youngcrane takes off.The old crane's gaze takes in an old manon the bench:He sits, offering tobacco, a bright copper braceletmotioning... comehere.Our foreheads touch, we breathe the same air,And as our foreheads meetThis world dissolves in golden light and love.Love is a place, a home.Another day, we may find ourselfwalking within a peaceful summer forest:Each flower, each plant, every blade of grassis vibrant, breathing inthe happy air that dances round us.SO1289 Oh, there seems to be a path,some deer may pass this way,Everything is so fresh and glistening,We may have never felt so aliveso full of life ...then arriving at a river,the path ends.There is a wooden bridge arched across the river,but upon it stands death,our own dusty skulls forming the railingsof the bridge.Who will dare to walk over this bridge?Looking up, we look across the river -It seems impossible.There are thousands of beings, like humansyet moving so gracefully as swanstheir many transparent arms and legsin a dance, they know we are here.They are beings of light,And one moves forward in greeting to the edge of the riverWhose head is brighter than a thousand suns:then, for an instant that lasts foreverwe are now on the other side of the riverwe can see ourself at the edge of theforest.There is only one lasting emotion compassion,and its voice is the drum. 3 290 w.4,i4,k2) '...-:fig4\"kitAY fiQ-N.......*, Research and Improvement (OERI)National Library of Education (NLE)Educational Resources Information order to disseminate as widely as possible timely and significant materials of interest to the educational community, documentsannounced in the monthly abstract journal of the ERIC system, Resources in Education (RIE), are usually made available to users in microfiche,reproduced paper copy, and electronic media, and sold through the ERIC Document Reproduction Service (EDRS).
