But even he was apprehensive about turning up to a client meeting at the Ace Hotel in Chelsea insisting on a liquid lunch \u2014 and claiming it was all in the name of team building. And it wasn't the three-martini, \"Mad Men\"-era repast of yore. Mr. Godshall and his two company co-founders had brought with them bottles of something less tantalizing: Cooler Cleanse's essential greens juice, a grassy blend featuring seven vegetables that Mr. Godshall described as \"gnarly tasting.\" Never mind paintball retreats, the office happy hour or workshops that employ the \"trust fall.\" Group cleanses (generally one-to-five-day, all-liquid diets with anywhere from a half-dozen to as many as 150 employees taking part) are emerging as one of the latest ways to solidify corporate bonds, on both Seventh Avenue and Wall Street. \"It was a week when we were slammed, and we just needed to pull together as a community,\" Mr. Godshall, 36, the company's creative director, said of the office-wide three-day 1,200-calorie cleanse this year. \"It was something we could do where we thought, 'We're all in this together.' \" What did the clients think? \"They just laughed,\" he said. (What they ate didn't torture him enough to remember it, though he said his senses were so heightened during the cleanse, \"I could smell roast chicken from four blocks away.\") Eric Helms, who founded the four-year-old Cooler Cleanse company with the actress Salma Hayek, says office cleansers now make up 30 percent of his business, and in the last year he has hired three customer-service employees just to handle the details of them. He said there has been a \"huge increase in popularity\" of cleansing with co-workers in the last year, which he credits to juice diets being more mainstream. \"Everyone knows someone who's done one, and they realize they're a lot easier to do with colleagues during the workweek,\" he said. \"People want to indulge\" \u2014 not sip celery \u2014 \"on weekends.\" These days, prettily packaged potions frequently occupy the refrigerator (and the conversation) at financial companies. \"I'll send 25 cleanses down to the same brokerage firm on Wall Street,\" said Mr. Helms, who also founded Juice Generation in 1999. \"And anywhere the financial industry is big we get group orders: Chicago, Dallas, Houston.\" Last year Oprah Winfrey's entire production staff in Chicago completed a three-day cleanse, he said, and the crew from \"Here Comes the Boom,\" a film Ms. Hayek recently shot in Boston, partook in the juice diet after being inspired by the actress. A spokeswoman for Organic Avenue \u2014 whose orange tote bags became ubiquitous after one was spotted arriving for Gwyneth Paltrow in 2008; the actress also plugged the brand in 2010 on her lifestyle Web site, GOOP \u2014 said the company's orders were now also about 30 percent office cleanses. Recent six-juice-a-day-dieters include employees at Merrill Lynch and the Carlyle Group, she said. In May, Citigroup began offering BluePrintCleanse in some of its Manhattan cafeterias, a spokeswoman said. Restaurant Associates, which runs the cafeteria, declined to explain the decision. The popularity of cleanses continues to rise, even as health experts seem dubious about the efficacy of some of these diets. \"Your liver and kidneys can handle toxins just fine,\" said Joan Salge Blake, a Boston University associate professor of nutrition, who has studied fad diets. \"There's no science to back up cleansing.\" About two-thirds of cleanse clients over all are women, but corporate cleanses \"commonly skew toward men, especially traders, investment bankers and lawyers,\" said Jina Wye, director of sales and marketing for BluePrintCleanse, founded in 2007 by two former Hudson Hotel bartenders looking to swap their poisons. (Mr. Helms said 90 percent of his male customers are part of groups.) Ms. Wye said: \"These Type-A men have an all-or-none perspective. If they're going to commit, they do it whole hog.\" Most popular among male en masse cleansers: the Excavation cleanse, described on the Web site as \"the most intense.\" Office cleanses are rarely corporate sponsored, subsidized or sanctioned. Several companies declined to allow employees to speak publicly about them because cleansing is a sensitive issue. In March, @VeraWanggang tweeted: \"Have been inspired by @glamour to try @coolercleanse. We are doing it as a team so none of us flake.\" But the spokeswoman Priya Shukla said in an e-mail that she decided recently that the company won't comment on diet or nutrition, which she noted are \"personal choices.\" Peter Alfano, a Citigroup vice president who took part in a three-day $210 BluePrintCleanse in April with colleagues, said he had been eating poorly for months and wanted to lose a few pounds. (His cleanse predated the cafeteria debut; the group ordered from the FreshDirect Web site.) \"I felt like I kept hearing about juice cleanses, and I thought, 'I'll try anything, let me see what this is all about,' \" said Mr. Alfano, 37. Cleansing with colleagues appealed to him because of the moral support. \"We would all hang out together at lunchtime, and we'd take our bottles to the park,\" he said. \"You can't wait for it to end, but the feeling of accomplishment is amazing.\" His group also banded together in what a fellow cleanser, Steve Callaghan, 49, referred to as \"Who Moved My Pineapple,\" inspired by the hunt for missing bottles of pineapple-apple-mint juice, a favorite flavor, hidden by mischievous noncleansing colleagues. (In the list of top cleansing fears, juice turning up missing does not make it. Consider the case of Tim Turnquist, 28, a still-on-solid-food ad copywriter, who stole a sip of a beet-based blend a Razorfish co-worker couldn't stomach. \"That juice has declared war against everything delicious,\" he says he said, and raced to rinse his mouth.) Those who choose to drink the kale at other offices reported enjoying creating rituals around the cleanse, if not always the juices (and the endless trips to the bathroom). At the Madison Avenue office of the fashion Web site Moda Operandi, every empty bottle was slammed triumphantly on the Ping-Pong table. At the Brooklyn outpost of a Big Four accounting firm, there was a first tentative sip in unison of that hour's concoction, followed by tasting notes \u2014 while cleanse dropouts were referred to as \"doing the walk of shame\" to the refrigerator. Employees on the business side of Shape magazine devised a relay-style warning system when there was free food around. Co-workers don't let co-workers drink alone, suggests the BluePrintCleanse Web site, noting that \"happy side effects include increased energy, productivity, focus and clarity (which come in handy at the office.)\" Cleansers may dispute the promise of alertness (\"I felt like I was jet-lagged,\" said Cynthia Rooney, who drank with 10 Ralph Lauren colleagues), but many agreed they were more productive. \"We all worked through lunch every day,\" said Tess McCarthy, 32, who joined seven colleagues on the business side of Shape magazine in a three-day cleanse. \"We didn't want to sit around thinking about food, so there was a lot of catching up on e-mails and organizing. I got tons of cleaning done.\" Maryann Bell, 25, a Moda Operandi Web developer, said, \"You realize your social life revolves around food, so you stay late at the office.\" Dijana, who asked to be identified by first name only because of company policy, and her group of 18 accountants arrived at work an hour early the day after the cleanse, though it was to break their three-day fast with eggs and oatmeal at the cafeteria. \"I think we would have gotten there two hours early,\" she said. Would most cleansers repeat the experience? Keith Tapper, 26, who jokingly referred to himself as the \"captain\" of the Ralph Lauren cleanse, said the next team-building activity would probably involve drinking \u2014 of the alcoholic variety. \"I think a happy hour would be a little more "}
