If we are not cautious about our own health it can lead to various subclinical discomforts in the future. We now know that we can achieve an excellent recovery rate (now which is above 90%) post-severe infections. Most people recover naturally post an infection, whilst slowly managing to revert to their old lifestyles. For others, however, while the virus may not be active in the body, caution needs to be practised in daily lives to [maintain immunity and health](https://atmantan.com/blog/raise-the-bar-on-your-health-by-boosting-immunity-understand-and-boost-immunity-the-natural-way/). The need for immunity care...The damage caused by the environs and a compromised lifestyle affects the different organs in your body. Even if an infection is mild or moderate, it is still possible that you are suffering from some respiratory, cardiac etc. health conditions. If you have had any other lifestyle illnesses or co-morbid conditions, the same may also get triggered, post a known infection. Our body tends to become weaker after this infection, along with a carry-forward feeling of lethargy and fatigue that sets in due to the continuous fight between the virus and our immune system. These post-infection complications are quite natural, and the good news is that these if identified early on, can be monitored and managed with care so that your body and you can get back to their optimal state of health. Our immune system is a reflection of our lifestyle and health. Since our immune system is the strongest armour we have for protecting us from recurrent infections, we must enhance this by indulging in healthy eating, a fitness-driven lifestyle and positive [mental health](https://atmantan.com/wellness_packages/holistic-health/) to build immunity. Lifestyle modifications today will certainly boost immunity tomorrow! There are various factors that can affect one's immunity, such as one's According to Science and research, for an infection to develop in the human body, there needs to be three key factors, known as an epidemiological triad - an infectious agent (virus or bacteria), a favourable environment (our natural surroundings), and a susceptible host (human). Since we can't always control and keep the 'agent' out of this equation, (we have poor control over this), we can at least choose to control and improve the 'environment' by ensuring it is a clean, safe, unpolluted, and natural environment, along with boosting the immunity of the 'host' so that he/she doesn't become vulnerable to the infection or post-recovery complications.

Case Study: Post-Infection Recovery of a 44-year-old Woman LIFE BEFORE ATMANTAN... This lady guest came to Atmantan with complaints of difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath, excessive tiredness and these symptoms seemed to get worse after physical activities. She also suffered from tightness in the chest, persistent cough, chest pain with pounding heartbeat, and an increase in migraine episodes. Along with all this, she was also suffering from general body ache and indigestion. After a detailed history, our Doctors got to know that this 44 year-old had recently suffered from the COVID infection. It was also hence confirmed that all of her symptoms clearly indicated compromised immunity. She was advised to be admitted to Atmantan for 14 days in the Super Immunity Programme. HEALING JOURNEY AT ATMANTAN... On our Doctor's advice, she got certain blood tests done as well. Her reports revealed an increase in her CRP level which is evidence of a severe inflammation in the bio-system. In fact this test gave us a clear picture of a post-covid complication with dysregulated immune system. The programme started with the ultimate goal of boosting her immunity through prescribed dietary changes. Her diet was designed in a way such that it would boost her immunity and it was supplemented with anti-inflammatory foods and a high protein diet. And the immunity shots were prioritised as well. Along with this, she was supplemented with Atmantan Naturals DEFENCE MAX (for improved immunity), CURCUMIN+ (anti oxidative and immunity enhancer), ALLERGY CARE (reduces histamine load and shields from allergies) and VIRGIN COCONUT OIL (for enhanced brain, skin and metabolic health). Her treatment regime included localized hydrotherapy, therapeutic body therapies, detox therapies, Yoga, outdoor exercises in the sun and focused breathing techniques, along with Yogic kriyas to relieve the congestion of the lungs. This daily schedule along with personal breathing modalities helped boost her recovery. HER TRANSFORMATION | SUPER IMMUNITY | 14 NIGHTS This routine effectively helped relieve her breathlessness & the congestion in the chest. Initially her breathing ratio was 1:0:1 which was improved to 1:2:4 (inhalation: hold: exhalation). This was evidence of her having achieved a conspicuous reduction in breathlessness. She also felt very energised and experienced a significant reduction in exertion fatigue too. Even her sleep quality had improved tremendously and she now felt an ease in breathing, and while doing daily her activities. Her will and commitment to getting back to pre-COVID health was truly inspiring and with the support of the team, she returned home stronger and healthier. She took back practices she learnt here at Atmantan, along with a recommended diet plan. How will it help boost my immunity?
