(7-6-94) c.Step 3. Multiply the result from Step 2, up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), by ten percent (10%), between fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) by twelve percent (12%),between sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) and seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) by fourteen percent (14%), and multiply the remainder over seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) by fifteen percent (15%). (7-6-94) d.Step 4. Add together the results of each calculation in Step 3. Add the total to the amount calculated in Step 2. This is the annual assessment. (7-6-94) e.Step 5. From the amount in Step 4, deduct the annual amount paid for health insurance premiums if this insurance covers the Medicaid child. (7-6-94) 06. Monthly Assessment Amount .

The parent must prove his AI is lower than income used for the yearly assessment. Recalculation is not automatic when the assessment formula changes inJanuary. (7-6-94) 14. Annual Adjustment . The AI is recalculated yearly in the same month as the initial assessment. The assessment is adjusted, if necessary. The parent must be sent a notice of the adjusted assessment. The parent can request an adjustment of the yearly assessment. The parent must provide a copy of his federal or state tax filing for that calendar year or other proof of annual income. The annual income is compared to the parent 's AI for that tax year. If the AI is less than the AI used to calculate the assessment, the assessment is adjusted. (7-1-97) 15. Annual Reconciliation . The parent 's assessment and the Medicaid cost excluding services provided by school districts or developmental disability centers for the child are reconciled at assessment year end. If the parent paid more than the Medicaid cost for the child, a credit is issued. If the child is no longer a Medicaid recipient, a refund is issued. Where a parent has more than one (1) child whose Medicaid costs are subject torecovery, the monthly assessment will be divided by the number of children whose costs are subject to recovery. Each child's prorated share of the assessment is then compared to the Medicaid costs for that child to determine whether a refund will be issued. No reconciliation is required where the difference between the projected AI and actual incomefor the tax year is a minimum of three thousand dollars ($3,000) or ten percent (10%) of annual AI, whichever is more. (7-6-94) 16. Annual Support Deduction Reconciliation . Where the parent paid more child support than was deducted, he is entitled to a credit or refund, if he so chooses.

If the total number of days of inpatient care exceeds the maximum number of allowable inpatient days computed in Subsection 104.10.a., then the payment limitation will be determined by: (7-1-94) (1) Calculating the ratio of the maximum allowable inpatient days to the number of actual days of inpatient care, and multiplying this ratio by the total reimbursement for inpatient care that was made. (10-24-88) (2) Multiplying excess inpatient care days by the routine home care rate. (10-24-88) (3) Adding the amounts calculated in Subsections 104.10.a.iii.(1) and 104.10.a.ii.(2). (10-24-88) (4) Comparing the amount in Subsection 104.10.a.iii.(3) with interim payments made to the hospice for inpatient care during the \"cap period \".

Payment For Physician Services . The basic rates for hospice care represent full reimbursement to the hospice for the costs of all covered services related to the treatment of the recipient 's terminal illness, including the administrative and general activities performed by physicians who are employees of or working under arrangements made with the hospice. These activities would generally be performed by the physician serving as themedical director and the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group. Group activities includeIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Health & Welfare, Division of Medicaid the Medical Assistance Program Page 63participation in the establishment of plans of care, supervision of care and services, periodic review and updating of plans of care, and establishment of governing policies. The costs for these services are included in the reimbursementrates for routine home care, continuous home care, and inpatient respite care. (10-24-88) a.Reimbursement for a hospice employed physician 's direct patient services which are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual Idaho Medicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services. These services will be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and, the related payments will be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Subsection 104.12 has beenexceeded. The only physician services to be billed by a hospice for such services are direct patient care services. Laboratory and X-ray services are included in the hospice daily rate. (7-1-94) b.Volunteer physician services are excluded from Medicaid reimbursement with the following exceptions: (10-24-88) i. A hospice may be reimbursed on behalf of a volunteer physician for specific direct patient care services which are not rendered on a volunteer basis.

The aforementioned charges are included in the daily rates paid and are expressly the responsibility of thehospice. (7-1-94) 12. Cap On Overall Reimbursement . Aggregate payments to each hospice will be limited during a hospice cap period per Subsection 104.01.e. The total payments made for services furnished to Medicaid recipients during this period will be compared to the \"cap amount \" for this period. Any payments in excess of the cap must be refunded by the hospice. (7-1-94) a.The overall cap will be compared to reimbursement after the inpatient limitation is computed and subtracted from total reimbursement due the hospice. (10-24-88) b.\"Total payment made for services furnished to Medicaid recipients during this period \" means all payments for services rendered during the cap year, regardless of when payment is actually made. (10-24-88) c.The \"cap amount \" is calculated by multiplying the number of recipients electing certified hospice care during the period by six thousand five hundred dollars ($6,500). This amount will be adjusted for eachsubsequent cap year beginning November 1, 1983, to reflect the percentage increase or decrease in the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It will also be adjusted as per Subsection 104.13. (7-1-94) d.The computation and application of the \"cap amount \" is made by the Department after the end of the cap period. (10-24-88) e.The hospice will report the number of Medicaid recipients electing hospice care during the period to the Department. This must be done within thirty (30) days after the end of the cap period as follows: (10-24-88) i. If the recipient is transferred to a noncertified hospice no payment to the noncertified hospice will be made and the certified hospice may count a complete recipient benefit period in their cap amount. (10-24-88) f.If a hospice certifies in mid-month, a weighted average cap amount based on the number of days falling within each cap period would be used. (10-24-88)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Health & Welfare, Division of Medicaid the Medical Assistance Program Page 6413. Adjustment Of The Overall Cap . Cap amounts in each hospice 's cap period will be adjusted to reflect changes in the cap periods and designated hospices during a recipient 's election period. The proportion of each hospice's days of service to the total number of hospice days rendered to the recipient during their election period will be multiplied by the cap amount to determine each hospice 's adjusted cap amount. (6-23-89) a.After each cap period has ended, the Department will calculate the overall cap within a reasonable time for each hospice participating in the Idaho Medicaid Program. (10-24-88) b.Each hospice 's cap amount will be computed as follows: (10-24-88) i. The share of the \"cap amount \" that each hospice is allowed will be based on the proportion of total covered days provided by each hospice in the \"cap period \". (6-23-89) ii. The proportion determined in Subsection 104.13.b. for each certified hospice will be multiplied by the \"cap amount \" specified for the \"cap period \" in which the recipient first elected hospice. (7-1-94) c.The recipient must file an initial election during the period beginning September 28 of the previous year through September 27 of the current cap year in order to be counted as an electing Medicaid recipient during the current cap year. (6-23-89) 14. Additional Amount For NF Residents .

The specialized wheelchairs and seating systems must be designed to fit the needs of a specific ICF/MR resident and cannot be altered to fit another client cost effectively. (7-1-99) c.Direct Care Staff. Direct Care staff in an ICF/MR are defined as the present on-duty staff calculated over all shifts in a twenty-four (24) hour period for each defined residential living unit. Direct care staff in an ICF/MRinclude those employees whose primary duties include the provision of hands-on, face-to-face contact with the clients of the facility. This includes both regular and live-in/sleep-over staff. It excludes professionals such as psychologists, nurses, and others whose primary job duties are not the provision of direct care, as well as managers/ supervisors whoare responsible for the supervision of staff. (5-25-93) d.Level of Involvement. Level of involvement relates to the severity of an MA recipient 's mental retardation. Those levels, in decreasing level of severity, are: profound, severe, moderate, and mild. (5-25-93) e.Direct Care Staffing Levels. The reasonable level of direct care staffing provided to an MA recipient in an ICF/MR setting will be dependent upon the level of involvement and the need for services and supports of the recipient as determined by the Department, or its representative, and will be subject to the following constraints: (7-1-94) i. Direct care staffing for a severely and profoundly retarded recipient residing in an ICF/MR must be a maximum of sixty-eight point twenty five (68.25) hours per week. (5-25-93) ii. Direct care staffing for a moderately retarded recipient residing in an ICF/MR must be limited to a maximum of fifty-four point six (54.6) hours per week. (5-25-93) iii.

(5-25-93) g.Phase-in Period. If enactment of Subsection 160.01.e. requires a facility to reduce its level of direct care staffing, a six (6) month phase-in period will be allowed from the date of the enactment of this section, without any resulting disallowances. Should disallowances result, the hourly rate of direct care staff used in determining disallowances will be the weighted average of the hourly rates paid to a facility 's direct care staff, plus the associated benefits, at the end of the phase-in period. (5-25-93) h.Exceptions. Should a provider be able to show convincing evidence documenting that the annual aggregate direct care hours as allowed under this section will compromise their ability to supply adequate care to the clients, as required by federal regulations and state rules, within an ICF/MR residential living unit and that other less costly options would not alleviate the situation, the Department will approve an additional amount of direct carehours sufficient to meet the extraordinary needs. This adjustment will only be available up through September 30,IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Health & Welfare, Division of Medicaid the Medical Assistance Program Page 1211996. (7-1-99) 02. Conditions Of Payment .

(5-25-93) 03. Post-Eligibility Treatment Of Income . Where an individual is determined eligible for MA participation in the cost of his long term care, the Department must reduce its payment to the long term care facilityby the amount of his income considered available to meet the cost of his care. This determination is made in accordance with Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.05.585, \"Rules Governing Eligibility for Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) \". (5-25-93) a.The amount which the MA recipient receives from SSA as reimbursement for his payment of the premium for Part B of Title XVIII (Medicare) is not considered income for patient liability (see Subsection 165.02and Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.05, Subsection 522.02.c., \"Rules Governing Eligibility for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD) \". (5-25-93) b.Payment by the Department for the cost of long term care is to include the date of the recipient 's discharge only if the discharge occurred after 3 p.m. and is not discharged to a related ICF/MR provider. If a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, his date of death is covered regardless of the time of occurrence. If anadmission and a discharge occur on the same date, then one (1) day of care shall be deemed to exist. (7-1-99) 04. Payments For Periods Of Temporary Absence . Payments may be made for reserving beds in long-term care facilities for recipients during their temporary absence if the facility charges private paying patients for reserve bed days, subject to the following limitations: (10-22-93) a.Facility Occupancy Limits.

Any changes in the amount of a recipient 's income; and (1-16-80) iii. When a recipient 's account has exceeded one thousand eight hundred dollars ($1800) for a single individual or two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800) for a married couple; and (7-1-99) iv. Other information about a recipient 's finances which potentially may affect eligibility for MA. (11-10-81) b.PASARR. All Medicaid certified nursing facilities must participate in, cooperate with, and meet all requirements imposed by, the Preadmission Screening and Additional Resident Review program (hereafter \"PASARR \") as set forth in 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart C, which, pursuant to Idaho Code Section 67-5229, is incorporated by reference herein. (7-1-98) i. Background and purpose. The purpose of these provisions is to comply with and implement the PASARR requirements imposed on the state by federal law. The purpose of those requirements is to prevent the placement of individuals with mental illness (MI) or mental retardation (MR) in a nursing facility (NF) unless their medical needs clearly indicate that they require the level of care provided by a nursing facility. This is accomplishedby both pre-admission screening (PAS) and additional resident review (ARR). Individuals for whom it appears that a diagnosis of MI or MR is likely are identified for further screening by means of a Level I screen. The actual PASARR is accomplished through a Level II screen where it is determined whether, because of the individual 's physical and mental condition, he or she requires the level of services provided by an NF. If the individual with MI or MR is determined to require an NF level of care, it must also be determined whether the individual requires specialized services. PASARR applies to all individuals entering or residing in an NF, regardless of payment source. (7-1-98) ii. Policy. It is the policy of the Department that the difficulty in providing specialized services in the NF setting makes it generally inappropriate to place individuals needing specialized services in an NF. This policy issupported by the background and development of the federal PASARR requirements, including the narrow definition of MI adopted by federal law. While recognizing that there are exceptions, it is envisioned that most individuals appropriate for NF placement will not require services in excess of those required to be provided by NFs by 42 CFR483.45. (11-6-93) iii. Inter-agency agreement. The state Medicaid agency will enter into a written agreement with the state mental health and mental retardation authorities as required in 42 CFR 431.621(c). This agreement will, among other things, set forth respective duties and delegation of responsibilities, and any supplemental criteria to be used in making determinations. (11-6-93) (1) The \"State Mental Health Authority \" (hereafter \"SMHA\") is the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (11-6-93)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Health & Welfare, Division of Medicaid the Medical Assistance Program Page 123(2) The \"State Mental Retardation or Developmental Disabilities Authority \" (hereafter \"SDDA\") is the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (11-6-93) iv. Coordination. The PASARR process is a coordinated effort between the state Medicaid agency, the SMHA and SDDA, independent evaluators and NFs. PASARR activities, to the extent possible, will be coordinatedthrough the Regional Medicaid Units (RMUs). RMUs will also be responsible for record retention and tracking functions. However, NFs are responsible for assuring that all screens are obtained and for coordination with the RMU, independent MI evaluators, the SMHA and SDDA, and their designees. Guidelines and procedures on how tocomply with these requirements can be found in \"Statewide PASARR Procedures \", a reference guide. (11-6-93) (1) Level I Screens. All required Level I reviews must be completed and submitted to the RMU, prior to admission to the facility. (11-6-93) (2) Level II Screens. When a NF identifies an individual with MI and/or MR through a Level I screen, or otherwise, the NF is responsible for contacting the SMHA or SDDA (as appropriate), or its designee, and assuring that a level II screen is completed prior to admission to the facility, or in the case of an existing resident, completed in order to continue residing in the facility. (11-6-93) (3) Additional Resident Reviews (ARR). An individual identified with MI and/or MR must be reviewed and a new determination made promptly after a significant change in his/her physical or mental condition.The facility must notify the RMU of any such change within two (2) working days of its occurrence. For the purpose of this section, significant change for the client 's mental condition means a change which may require the provision of specialized services or an increase in such services. A significant change in physical condition is a change thatrenders the client incapable of responding to MI or D.D. program interventions. (7-1-98) v. Determinations. Determinations as to the need for NF care and determinations as to the need for specialized services should not be made independently. Such determinations must often be made on an individual basis, taking into account the condition of the resident and capability of the facility to which admission is proposed to furnish the care needed. When an individual identified with MI and MR is admitted to a NF, the NF is responsible formeeting that individual 's needs, except for the provision of specialized services. (7-1-94) (1) Level of care. (11-6-93)(a) Individual determinations. Must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. (11-6-93) (b) Categorical determinations. Recognizing that individual determinations of level of care are not always necessary, those categories set forth as examples at 42 CFR 483.130(d) are hereby adopted as appropriate forcategorical determinations. When NF level of care is determined appropriate categorically, the individual may be conditionally admitted prior to completion of the determination for specialized services. However, conditional admissions cannot exceed seven (7) days, except for respite admissions, which cannot exceed thirty (30) consecutivedays in one (1) calendar year. (11-6-93) (2) Specialized services. Specialized services for mental illness as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(1), and for mental retardation as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(2), are those services provided by the state which due to the intensity and scope can only be delivered by personnel and programs which are not included in the specialized rehabilitation services required of nursing facilities under 42 CFR 483.45. The need for specialized services must bedocumented and included in both the resident assessment instrument and the plan of care. (11-6-93) (a) Individual determinations. Must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. (11-6-93) (b) Group determinations. Catagorical determinations that specialized services are not needed may be made in those situations permitted by 42 CFR 483.130. The same time limits, imposed by Subsection 160.06.b.v.(a)(2) shall apply. (11-6-93) vi. Penalty for non-compliance. No payment shall be made for any services rendered by a NF prior toIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Health & Welfare, Division of Medicaid the Medical Assistance Program Page 124completion of the Level I screen and, if required, the Level II screen. Failure to comply with PASARR requirements for all individuals admitted or seeking admission may also subject a NF to other penalties as part of certificationaction under 42 CFR 483.20. (11-6-93) vii. Appeals. Discharges, transfers, and preadmission screening and additional resident review (PASARR) determinations may be appealed to the extent required by 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart E, which, pursuant to Idaho Code, 67-5229, is incorporated by reference herein. Appeals under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with the fair hearing provisions of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings, \" IDAPA 16.05.03, Section 300. A Level I finding of MI or MR is not an appealable determination. It may be disputed as part of a Level II determination appeal. (7-1-98) viii. Automatic repeal. In the event that the Preadmission Screening and Annual Resident Review program is eliminated or made non-mandatory by act of congress, the provisions of Subsection 160.06.b. of this chapter shall cease to be operative on the effective date of any such act, without further action. (11-6-93) 07. Provider Application And Certification . (1-16-80) a.A facility can apply to participate as a nursing facility. (7-1-94) b.A facility can apply to participate as an ICF/MR facility. (1-16-80) 08. Licensure And Certification . (7-13-89) a.Upon receipt of an application from a facility, the Licensing and Certification Agency must conduct a survey to determine the facility 's compliance with certification standards for the type of care the facility proposes to provide to MA recipients. (7-13-89) b.If a facility proposes to participate as a skilled nursing facility, Medicare (Title XVIII) certification and program participation is required before the facility can be certified for Medicaid. The Licensing andCertification Agency must determine the facility 's compliance with Medicare requirements and recommend certification to the Medicare Agency. (7-1-94) c.If the Licensing and Certification Agency determines that a facility meets Title XIX certification standards for nursing facility care or ICF/MR, the Section must certify to the appropriate branch of government that the facility meets the standards for NF or ICF/MR types of care. (7-1-94) d.Upon receipt of the certification from the Licensing and Certification Agency, the Bureau may enter into a provider agreement with the long-term care facility. (7-13-89) e.After the provider agreement has been executed by the Facility Administrator and by the Chief of the Bureau, one (1) copy must be sent by certified mail to the facility and the original is to be retained by the Bureau. (11-10-81) 09. Determination Of Entitlement To Long-Term Care . Entitlement to MA participation in the cost of long-term care exists when the individual is eligible for MA and the RNR has determined that the individual meets the criteria for NF or ICF/MR care and services. Entitlement must be determined prior to authorization of payment for such care for an individual who is either a recipient of or an applicant for MA. (7-1-94) a.The criteria for determining a MA recipient 's need for either nursing facility care or intermediate care for the mentally retarded must be as set forth in Subsections 180.03 or 180.08. In addition, the IOC/UC nursemust determine whether a MA recipient 's needs could be met by non-inpatient alternatives including, but not limited to, remaining in an independent living arrangement or residing in a room and board situation. (7-1-94) b.The recipient can select any certified facility to provide the care required. (11-10-81) c.The final decision as to the level of care required by a MA recipient must be made by the IOC/UC Nurse. (7-1-94)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Health & Welfare, Division of Medicaid the Medical Assistance Program Page 125d.The final decision as to the need for DD or MI active treatment must be made by the appropriate Department staff as a result of the Level II screening process. (7-13-89) e.No payment must be made by the Department on behalf of any eligible MA recipient to any long- term care facility which, in the judgment of the IOCT/UCT is admitting individuals for care or services which are beyond the facility 's licensed level of care or capability. (7-1-94) 10. Authorization Of Long-Term Care Payment . If it has been determined that a person eligible for MA is entitled to MA participation in the cost of long-term care, and that the facility selected by the recipient is licensed and certified to provide the level of care the recipient requires, the Field Office will forward to such facilityan \"Authorization for Long-Term Care Payment \" form HW 0459. (7-1-94) 161. HOSPITAL SWING-BED REIMBURSEMENT. The Department will pay for NF care in certain rural hospitals. Following approval by the Department, such hospitals may provide service to recipients who require NF level of care as defined by Subsection 180.03 in licensed hospital (\"swing\") beds. (7-1-94) 01. Facility Requirements . The Department will approve hospitals for NF care provided to eligible recipients under the following conditions: (7-1-94) a.The Department 's Licensure and Certification Section finds the hospital in conformance with the requirements of 42 CFR 482.66 \"Special Requirements \" for hospital providers of long-term care services ( \"swing- beds\"); and (8-23-90) b.The hospital is approved by the Medicare program for the provision of \"swing-bed \" services; and (5-1-84) c.The facility does not have a twenty-four (24) hour nursing waiver granted under 42 CFR 488.54(c); and (8-23-90) d.The hospital must not have had a swing-bed approval terminated within the two (2) years previous to application for swing-bed participation; and (8-23-90) e.The hospital must be licensed for less than one hundred (100) beds as defined by 42 CFR 482.66(a)(1) for swing-bed purposes; and (8-23-90) f.NF services in swing-beds must be rendered in beds used interchangeably to furnish hospital or NF type services.
