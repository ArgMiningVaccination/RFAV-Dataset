Abstract This study considers the molecular weight, conformation, stability and nanoparticle formation of the polysaccharide chitosan in relation to its pharmaceutical applications in the drug delivery. Chitosan has bioadhesive and absorption enhancing properties that augment its use in the delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides across mucosal membranes. The molecular weights of a range of chitosans, with degree of aceytlation (DA) ranging form 7 to 30%, were studied using the hydrodynamic techniques of SEC-MALLS (size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering) and analytical ultracentrifugation. It was found that there was reasonable agreement between the two techniques with molecular weights obtained ranging between 42000 and 200000 kDa. These results indicated that the use of SEC-MALLS as a measure of degradation during storage studies would be valid and this technique would be more convenient due to the much shorter time required for each sample. Conformational studies indicated that in 0.2M acetate buffer, pH 4.3, the chitosan samples studied appeared to have an extended conformation which is in agreement with studies performed by other researchers (e.g. Anthonsen, M. W., K. M. VArum and O. Smidsmd (1993) Carbohydrate Polymers 11: 193- 201 and Dyer, A. M., M. Hinchcliffe, Watts, J. Castile, I. Jabbal .. Oill, R. Nankervis, A. Illum (2002) Pharmaceutical Research 19(7): 998-1008), non-withstanding complications in interpretation through possible solvent draining effects (Berth, 0., Colfen, H., Dautzenberg H (2002) Prog. Coil. Int. Sci. 119, 50-57). ii Degradation studies were performed using viscosity measurements and SEC\u00ad MALLS to measure molecular weight. The effect of solution parameters such as pH and ionic strength were examined as well as structural parameters, e.g. molecular weight and DA. Degradation was found to increase as the pH of the solution decreased indicating that acid hydrolysis was occurring. The range of ionic strength studied (0.1 -0.3M) did not have any significant effect on degradation rate. For the samples studied, molecular weight appeared to have little effect on degradation, however, the more deacetylated the polysaccharide, the slower the rate of degradation due to increased charged residues along the chain. Finally chitosan nanoparticles were then prepared using ionotropic gelation with tripolyphosphate pentasodium. This technique produced nanoparticles in the size range 320 -380 run with an insulin loading capacity of 30-50%. Insulin-loaded nanoparticles were prepared and resuspended in acetate buffer at various pHs. The molecular weight and insulin loading was tested at 2- week intervals and results indicated that chitosan degradation was reduced by 30% compared to a control chitosan solution, and the total amount of insulin incorporated remained constant over the storage period.

DA -Degree of Acetylation -Tripolyphosphate f -frictional coefficient M - molecular weight weight C* -critical overlap concentration xxi Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 1: Introduction Treatment of various diseases requires the efficient delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides. Various hormones used in deficiency conditions such as growth hormone, and calcitonin can be delivered subcutaneously for the treatment of dwarfism and osteoporisis. Of particular interest is the treatment of Type I diabetes that requires the administration of insulin. Presently insulin is delivered by subcutaneous injection, which can be inconvenient for the patient. The most convenient method of drug delivery is by the oral route. However, this is not at present possible for insulin due to its degradation in the gastrointestinal tract by enzymatic degradation and the highly acidic conditions in the stomach. However, several drug delivery companies are showing promising results for oral delivery of insulin using novel polymer systems such as Emisphere and Nobex (Angelo et al. 2002; Clement et al. 2004). Extensive research also has shown that insulin may be delivered nasally and absorbed in sufficient quantities to obtain a therapeutic response if administered in conjunction with the polysaccharide chitosan (I11um et al. is a cationic polysaccharide derived from chitin, which is found in the shells of crustaceans (Anthonsen et al. 1993; Sugimoto et al. 1998). Chitosan enables insuiin to be delivered intranasally by two important m\u20ac(chanisms. Firstly, chitosan is mucoadhesive due to its cationic nature (Lehr et al. 1992; He et al. 1998), and secondly, it is believed to cause a transient opening of the tight junctions between the mucosal epithelium cells allowing the protein insulin to be -1-Chapter 1: Introduction absorbed through the nasal membrane (Artursson et al. 1994; Borchard et al. 1996; Schipper et al. 1997). These properties of chitosan are discussed in more detail in sections 1.1 and 1.2. In a nasal insulin formulation, chitosan acts as an absorption enhancer and is therefore an essential excipient in the formulation. Changes in the molecular weight and structure of chitosan due to degradation processes during storage of the formulation, may affect its mucoadhesive properties and its ability to function as an absorption enhancer. In this project, the degradation of chitosan was investigated under various solvent conditions and evaluated by measurement of the molecular weight using various hydrodynamic techniques (described in Chapter 4 and 5). Further research on the formulation used to deliver insulin nasally has lead to the development of chitosan nanoparticles (IlIum et al. al. 1999; Janes et al. 2001; Dyer et al. 2002). The second part of this project was focused on the optimisation ofnanopartic1e formation, methods for measuring insulin loading and the stability of chitosan within a nanopartic1e preparation (Chapters 6 and 7). Firstly, we will look at the use of chitosan in drug delivery and the physicochemical properties of chitosan. -2-Chapter 1: Introduction 1.1 Use of Chifosan in Drug Delivery The development of new routes for administering therapeutic proteins and peptides is of considerable interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Today, most of these compounds are delivered parenterally due to problems with the use of other routes of delivery such as degradation in the stomach and in the gastrointestinal tract and poor permeation of the mucosa associated with oral delivery. The use of parenteral delivery is inconvenient for the patient and can lead to reduced compliance. Extensive research has been carried out on alternative ways of delivering macromolecular compounds to the body. As such, chitosan as a drug delivery system for nasal and oral delivery has been intensively investigated (Dlum et al. 1994; Davis et al. 2001). Chitosan possesses two important properties, which makes it an exciting polymer in drug delivery. These are bioadhesion and absorption enhancement. We shall now consider these properties in detail. 1.1.1 Bioadhesion There are a number of characteristics necessary for a polymer to exhibit mucoadhesion (Lehr et al. 1992). These include: 1) strong hydrogen-bonding groups (-OH, -COOH) 2) high molecular weight 3) sufficient chain flexibility 4) surface energy properties favouring spreading onto mucus. Chitosan possesses all of these properties (Lehr et al. 1992) and therefore should be mucoadhesive. Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide, and it has -3-Chapter 1: Introduction been suggested that positively charged polymeric hydrogels could develop additional molecular attraction forces by electrostatic interactions with negatively charged mucosal surfaces. Mucus is a viscoelastic substance with a characteristic stickiness which lines the gastrointestinal tract and other routes in the body such as the nasal cavity. By weight, mucus is mostly water (95.0 -99.5%) with electrolytes, serum proteins, immunoglobulins and lipids. Its important polymeric, gel~ forming component is the mucus glycoprotein or mucin (0.5 -5.(010). Mucins are large molecules with molecular weights ranging from 0.5 x 106 to over 20 x 106 glmol and contain a large amount of carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are made up of several different monosaccharides, of which sialic acid is the most important in terms of mucoadhesion (Harding et al. 1999). In nasal delivery, the mucociliary clearance may greatly affect the absorption especially of hydrophilic drugs. The importance of the continual clearance of the mucus layer in the GI tract for absorption is less certain. The addition of a mucoadhesive agent to a drug formulation will increase the time that the drug is in contact with the mucosal surface, and hence increase absorption. It is the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged amino groups on chitosan and the negatively charged sialic acid residues in mu~in that is believed to account for chitosan's mucoadhesive nature. This has been demonstrated by He et al. (1998) who studied the mucoadhesive properties of chitosan and poly(viuyl alcohol) by turbidimetric measurements. The results suggested a strong interaction between chitosan and mucin, whilst there was little interaction between PV A and mucin due to PV A being negatively -4~ Chapter 1: Introduction charged. The attraction between chitosan and sialic acid was also confirmed by the observation of greater adsorption the greater the sialic acid content of the mucin. Fiebrig et al. (1994) also demonstrated the interaction of chitosan and mucin using the analytical ultracentrifuge. When chitosan and mucin where mixed, large complexes where formed with a smixlsmucin ratio of approximately IS-38. This complexation was pH dependent (see below). Also, no mucin was found to be unreacted and the results were consistent with a strong electrostatic interaction. 1.1.1.1 Effect of pH on Bioadbesion Several groups have observed differences in the bioadhesion of chitosan at different pHs (Lehr et a!. 1992; He et al. 1998; Rossi et al. 2000). Most studies on the bioadhesive properties of chitosan have looked at the effects in the gastrointestinal tract. The pH in the GI tract varies from pH 1.2 in the stomach to pH 7.S in the large intestine. This will affect the ionisation of both chitosan (pKa -6.S) and sialic acid 2.6). In an acidic environment (pH<S.S), approximately 90% of the amino residues on chitosan exist in the ionic form. Further decreases in pH will have little further effect on ionis,ation. On the other hand, sialic acid is highly sensitive to pH changes in an acidic environment. He et al. (1998) observed a decrease in the number of ionised sialic acid residues when the pH changed from pH S.5 to pH 3.5, and furthermore, when the pH changed to pH 1.2, the zeta potential of mucin reversed from negative to positive. The electrostatic interaction between chitosan and mucin will therefore be strongest at -pHS.5 due to the increased number of charged sialic acid residues. -S-Chapter 1: Introduction Fiebrig et al. (1994) also studied the effect of pH on chitosan-mucin interaction using the analytical ultracentrifuge. The results showed that as the pH was lowered below pH 6.5 to below the pKa of sialic acid, the size of the complex reduced (-12-22) but the interaction was still significant. 1.1.2 Absorption Enhancement Bioadhesion can account for some of the absorption enhancement abilities of chitosan since it will allow a drug to stay longer in contact with the mucosal surface, increasing the available time for absorption. Further absorption enhancement has been attributed to chitosan's ability to cause a transient opening of the tight junctions in the epithelial membrane (Artursson et al. 1994; Borchard et al. 1996; Schipper et al. 1997). This function is very important for the delivery of proteins and peptides, which are excluded from transcellular transport due to their size and hydrophilic nature. The paracellular absorption pathway is also limited, due to the entry of large molecules being restricted by the tight junctions (Artursson et al. 1994; Kotze et al. 1997). 1.1.2.1 Structure and Function of Tight Junctions One of the functions of the epithelial cells is to provide a permeability barrier between the different environments on either side of the cell and to allow transport across the cell layer. In order to perform these functions, the epithelial cells contain a highly specialised cellular component: the junctional complex. The junctional complex contains several well defined structures of which the tight junction is the most relevant here. The tight junction separates the apical and basolateral domains and is the major paracellular barrier to the absorption of proteins and other compounds -6-Chapter I: Introduction (Denker and Nigam 1998). Several proteins are associated with the tight junctions; membrane bound proteins such as occludin and cytoplasmic proteins such as zona occludens 1 (ZO~l). Occludin is believed to control the paracellular permeability of the tight junction while ZO-I may function as part of a signal pathway within the cytoskeleton in controlling membrane permeability. In intact tight junctions these proteins are strongly associated with the plasma membrane, however, when tight junction formation is prevented e.g. A TP depletion, these proteins are relocated from the membrane to other cellular compartments (Smith et al. 2004). 1.1.2.2 Effect of Chitosan on Tight Junctions Dodane et al. (1999) and Kotze et al. (1999) studied the effect of chitosan on caco-2 cell monolayers. It was found that chitosan hydrochloride and chitosan glutamate decreased the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of caco-2 monolayers, which indicates a decrease in the tightness of the junctions between cells. Chitosan hydrochloride was found to be more effective than chitosan glutamate, however, this could be explained by differences in the amount of free chitosan base in each salt. About 50% of chitosan glutamate by weight is the glutamate salt whereas only a small fraction (5-10%) of chitosan hydrochloride is the chloride salt. Dodane and Vilivalam (1998) and Smith et al. (2004) found that chitosan affected the location of ZO-l and occludin. These membrane bound proteins were found to have relocated to the cytoskeleton after chitosan treatment. It was thought that chitosan may affect the intracellular A TP levels, since a similar pattern of protein relocation is seen during the formation of tight ~7-Chapter 1: Introduction junctions following ATP depletion, however, measurement of ATP levels showed no depletion in A TP. Artursson et al. (1994) and Dodane and Vilivalam (1998) also found a change in the F -actin distribution, which is known to increase paraceUular permeability (Meza et al. 1982). However, this effect was not observed by Smith et al. (2004). In conclusion it would appear that the effects of chitosan on membrane permeability are due to relocation of the tight junction proteins resulting in their transient opening. Many other compounds have been studied as absorption enhancers for proteins and peptides, however, many of them cause damage to the epithelial membrane (Thanou et al. 2001). Chitosan does not cause irreversible damage to the epithelia as has been demonstrated by several authors. Kotze et al. (1997) stained caco-2 cell monolayers with trypan blue after prolonged incubation with chitosan. No visible intracellular uptake of this marker was observed indicating that the monolayers remained undamaged and functionally intact. Also, after removal of the polymer, the TEER of the caco-2 cells recovered, again showing that the cells were undamaged and functionally intact (Borchard et al. 1996; Dodane et al. 1999). Aspden et al. (1996) studied the effects of chitosan on nasal epithelia membranes and found only slightly more protein and enzyme release than occurred after perfusing with normal saline. The increased protein release was attributed to increased mucus production by the goblet cells, and it was concluded that chitosan would be safe to use as a nasal drug enhancer. The influence of chitosan's degree of acetylation and molecular weight on the permeability of caco-2 cell intestinal mon{)layers was studied by Schipper et -8-Chapter 1: Introduction al. (1996) using chitosan solution at pH 5.5 and the non-absorbable paracellular marker e4C] mannitol. It was found that chitosans with a low degree of acetylation (DA) were effective as permeation enhancers at low and high molecular weight, whereas chitosans of high DA were effective at only high molecular weight. The effects of chitosans of both high and low molecular weight and degree of acetylation were further investigated as regard to the ability of these compounds to bind with epithelial caco-2 cell monolayers (Schipper et al. 1997). Both chitosans appeared to bind tightly to the epithelium, inducing a redistribution of F-actin and the tight junction protein ZO-l. No intracellular uptake of chitosan could be observed. It was also shown that these effects were mediated by cationic charges of chitosan, since the addition of the highly anionic heparin in the test solutions inhibited the permeation enhancing effects. Chitosan also has other characteristics that are considered necessary for an absorption enhancer (Behl et al. 1998), for example: pharrnacologically inert at concentrations used, non-irritating, non-toxic and non-allergenic, any effect on the mucosa is completely reversible, remains in COtltact with the mucosa long enough to achieve a maximal effect, no offensive odour or taste, relatively inexpensive and readily available. 1.1.3 Oral Delivery of Polypeptides At present, most protein and peptide drugs are administered parenterally. This can be inconvenient for the patient and lead to reduced compliance. Oral -9-Chapter 1: Introduction delivery is the most convenient method of drug delivery; however, this poses problems for polypeptides. Most protein and peptide drugs are poorly absorbed following oral administration due to substantial degradation in the GI tract and/or poor permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier. It is known for instance that dietary proteins do not normally cross the intestinal epithelium intact, but must first be broken down to their constituent free amino acids, which are then absorbed. Such degradation and consequent absorption destroys all physiological activity of the protein and can explain why typical oral bioavailabilities of proteins are usually less than 1-2% (Carino and Mathiowitz 1999). Furthermore drugs delivered orally are susceptible to first pass metabolism in the liver. The addition of chitosan to an oral formulation can reduce permeability problems, as it possesses bioadhesive and absorption enhancement properties, however, this does not solve the problems of degradation that occurs in the GI tract. Also, the changes in pH along the GI tract from pH 1.2 in the stomach to pH 7.5 in the large intestine affect the solubility and protonation of chitosan. 1.1.3.1 Chitosan for Oral Absorption Enhancement The oral delivery of proteins is hindered by low bioavailability, poor residence time at site of absorption, and poor drug stability due to proteolytic ehzymes. Chitosan may improve absorption and residence times through its absorption enhancing properties and mucoadhesion, however, there is still a low bioavailability due to degradation of the drug both in the acidic conditions of the stomach and by proteolytic enzymes. It is known that chitosan does not -10-Chapter 1: Introduction exhibit any inhibitory action on proteolytic enzymes as demonstrated by Lue6en et al. (1996) following oral administration of a synthetic peptide in rats. A potential method to overcome the acidic conditions in the stomach are to use a controlled delivery matrix such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), which swells on contact with water to form a hydrated gel that remains sufficiently intact through the gastrointestinal tract to protect the incorporated drug. Unfortunately, chitosan is unable to act as an absorption enhancer in the small intestine due to the neutral pH at which it is insoluble (Hejazi and Amiji 2003). Borchard et al. (1996) investigated chitosan glutamate solutions at pH 7.4 for their effect in increasing the paraceUular permeability of [14C] mannitol vitro in caco-2 cells. No effect on the permeability of the monolayers could be observed, indicating that at neutral pH chitosan is not effective as permeation enhancer. The pH dependency of chitosan's effect on epithelial permeability was further studied by Kotze et al. (1998). Two chitosan salts (hydrochloride and glutamate) were evaluated for their ability to enhance the transport of [14C] mannitol across caco-2 cell monolayers at two pH values, 6.2 and 7.4. At low pH both chitosans showed a pronounced effect on the permeability of the marker, leading to 25-fold (glutamate salt) and 36- fold (hydrochloride salt) enhancement. However, at pH 7.4 both chitosans failed to increase the permeability, due to solubility problems. Chitosan and chitosan salts have poor solubility at neutral pH values since aggregation occurs in solutions at pH values above 6.5, and only protonated chitosan (i.e. in its _uncoiled configuration) can trigger the opening of the tight junctions (Artursson et al. 1994), thereby faciliPiting the paracellular transport of -11-Chapter 1: Introduction hydrophilic compounds. Chitosan can only be effective as an absorption enhancer in a limited area of the intestinal lumen where the pH values are close to its pKa. For intestinal absorption the use of a chitosan derivative is necessary and these are discussed in section 1.1.3.2. An alternative delivery site of peptides and proteins is the colon, where there is lower proteolytic enzyme activity and a longer residence time. Tozaki et al. (1997) studied the use of HPMC coated chitosan capsules for the colonic delivery of insulin in rats. It was found that after 6 hrs~ when the capsules reached the colon, a hypoglycaemic effect was observed that lasted for 24 hrs. The HPMC outer coating protected the insulin from the acidic conditions in the stomach. It then dissolves in the small intestine and the inner chitosan capsule layer protects the insulin until it reaches the colon where the microflora biodegrade the chitosan capsule and the insulin is released. Tominaga et al. (1998) demonstrated a similar delivery system using an inner coating of chitosan and an outer coating of phytin, a gastric acid resistant material. 1.1.3.2 Chitosan derivatives for oral absorption enhancement N-trimethyl chitosan chloride (TMC), a partially quaternised much higher aqueous solubility than chitosan in a much broader pH and concentration range. The reason for this improved solubility is the substitution of the primary amine with methyl groups and the prevention of hydrogen bond formation between the amine and the hydroxylic groups of the chitosan backbone. Thanou et al. (2001) and Kotze et al. (1999) studied the effects of TMC on intestinal absorption. Chitosan HCI and TMCs of different degrees of trimethylation were tested for enhancing the permeability of the -12-Chapter 1: Introduction radiolabelled marker e4C] mannitol in caco-2 intestinal epithelia at neutral pH values (PH 7.2). Chitosan HCl failed to increase the permeation of these monolayers and so did TMC with a degree of methylation of 12.8%. However, TMC with a degree of trimethylation 60% significantly the [14C] mannitol permeability across caco-2 intestinal monolayers, indicating that a threshold value at the charge density of the polymer is necessary to trigger the opening of the tight junctions at neutral pH values. Visualisation studies using confocallaser scanning microscopy showed that TMC polymers widened the paracellular pathways in a similar way to protonated chitosan without causing cell membrane damage. The effect of TMC60 was studied in vivo in rats using the peptide drug buserelin. Buserelin formulations with or without TMC60 (PH 7.2) were compared with chitosan dispersions at neutral pH values after intraduodenal administration in rats. A remarkable increase in buserelin serum concentrations was observed after co-administration with TMC60, whereas buserelin alone was poorly absorbed. 1.1.3.3 Chitosan nanopartieles for oral delivery An alternative approach for the oral delivery of proteins is using microspheres/capsules. There are three major mechanisms by which microspheres can .improve oral delivery of proteins (Carino et al. 2000): 1. the spheres can protect the protein from proteolysis 2. the spheres can cross over the intestinal mucosa 3. the spheres can change the inter-tissue distribution of the protein. Damge et al. (1990) studied the oral delivery of insulin in rats using isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate microspheres. A significant reduction in blood glucose levels was observed that lasted for 20 days ~demonstrating that the microspheres -13-Chapter 1: Introduction protected the insulin from proteolysis and was able to change the distribution of insulin so that a slow and prolonged release occurred. Howevert similar studies showed no therapeutic response and possible degradation of the insulin (Couvreur et al. 1980), and ineffectiveness when administered to fed rats (Damge et al. 1988). For intestinal uptake of micro spheres an upper size limit of about 10J.lIll has been observed (Ermak et al. 1995). Since it is difficult to control the size distribution of microspheres/nanoparticles produced, and hence their uptake across the intestinal mucosa, an alternative use of microspheres is to provide the delivery of the protein to the site of absorption at a high concentration. However, for this to be advantageous the addition of mucoadhesives and absorption enhancers is necessary and as such chitosan nanoparticles can provide both of these characteristics. Chitosan nanoparticles can be formed using several techniques. For example, Ohya et al. (1994) prepared nanospheres using a water-in-oil emulsion method followed by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. However, the glutaraldehyde not only interacted with the chitosan but also with the active drug, causing drug immobilization rather than encapsulation. Since proteins can easily denatured by production methods that require harsh conditions such as high temperatures or crosslinking agents, the use of an ionic gelation technique has proved highly favourable. Chitosan nanoparticles can be formed by researchers (Bodmeier et al. 1989; Femandez-Urrusuno et al. 1999; Shu and Zhu 2000; Dyer et al. 2002). These nanoparticles show high protein loading (up to 50mg per 100mg of nanoparticles) and along with the absorption -14-Chapter 1: Introduction enhancing properties of chitosan offer a very promising delivery system for proteins and peptides. 1.1.4 Nasal Delivery of Polypeptides Oral delivery of proteins and peptides requires further research, especially if an oral formulation for the delivery of insulin is to be considered. An alternative delivery route is via the nose. The nasal cavity possesses many advantages for drug delivery (Behl et al. 1998; Soane et al. 1999): relatively large surface area for absorption with subepithelial layer that is highly vascularised (only two cell layers separate the nasal lumen from the dense \\>lood vessel network in the lamina proporia), blood drains directly into the systemic circulation, avoiding first pass metabolism by the liver, fast onset of therapeutic action, non-invasive, therefore, reduced risk of infection, ease of convenience and self-medication, and improved patient compliance. Despite these structural advantages for drug delivery, the bioavailability of most polypeptide drugs is less than 1 % since the molecules are polar and too large to easily pass the tight junctions in the membrane. Furthermore, the time available for absorption is limited due to mucociliary clearance: Chitosan can increase the nasal bioavailability of poorly absorbed drugs by increasing nasal membrane permeability and increasing the contact time for absorption by reducing the mucociliary clearance rate. -15-Chapter 1: Introduction 1.1.4.1 Structure of Nasal Cavity The nasal cavity, located mainly within the skull, is divided into two approximately equal halves by the nasal septum with each half beginning anteriorly at the nares/nostrils of the external nose and extending posteriorly to the nasopharynx where the two halves of the airway join together. It has a total volume of 15-20ml and a total surface area of about 150cm2 which can be divided into three functional regions: the vestibular region (the anterior 10-20cm2), the olfactory region (occupying 10-20cm2 in the roof of the nasal cavity), the respiratory region (about 130cm2), which occupies the majority of the main part of the nasal cavity and is important for the absorption of drugs into the systemic circulation. The respiratory region contains bony \"scroll-like\" turbinates (inferior, middle and superior), which are attached to the lateral wall and project downwards into the main part of the nasal cavity, considerably increasing the surface area. In this region, the epithelium is composed of ciliated and non-ciliated cells (Mygind and Dahl 1998). Cilia play an important role in mucociliary clearance which is discussed in more detail in section 1.1.4.2.1. The lamina propria (a loose type of connective tissue which anchors the. mucosa to the underlying skeletal structure) contains many blood vessels, nerve~ and glands. Blood is supplied to the nose posteriorly by a large branch of the sphenopalatine artery, superiorly by a branch from the anterior ethmoid artery and antero-inferiorly by a branch from the superior labial branch of the facial artery (Jones 2001). -16-Chapter 1: Introduction The respiratory epithelium, in addition to cilia, is covered by a mucus layer consisting of two distinctive layers, the aqueous periciliary layer that surrounds the cilia and a more gellous upper layer on top of the cilia. Both cilia and the mucus layer play an important role in mucociliary clearance which is a major barrier to nasal drug absorption. 1.1.4.2 Factors affecting nasal absorption 1.1.4.2.1 Mucociliary clearance The function of the mucociliary clearance system (MCS) is to remove foreign substances and particles from the nasal cavity, preventing them reaching the lower airways. Normal mucociliary transit time in humans has been reported to be. 12 to 15 minutes, with the average rate of nasal clearance being 8mmfmin (Marttin et al. 1998). Cilia range in length between 5 and 10 J.Ull and in width from 0.1 to 0.3 f.Ul1. The number of cilia per cell is approximately 200, with a density of 6 -8 cilia per f.Ul12. The beating of a cilium has three phases; an effective stroke, during which the cilium is extended maximally; the rest phase, in which it is parallel to the cell surface; and the recovery stroke. The average ciliary beat frequency in humans is 10Hz and is regulated by several factors: temperature, intracellular Ca2 :+-and cAMP levels, and by extracellular ATP. An increase in temperature of between 5 and 20\u00b0C increases ciliary beat frequency (Marttin et al. 1998) and the optimum working temperature is 35-40\u00b0C (Jones 2001). . Mucus forms the other part of the MCS. This consists of two distinct layers: . the aqueous periciliary layer and a more gellous upper layer. The periciliary layer is a low viscosity fluid, probably formed by epithelial cell exudates, with a thickness that is slightly less than the length of an extended cilium. This is ~17-Chapter 1: Introduction covered by a more viscous upper layer of about 0.5-5.0 /lID deep, which is secreted by the goblet cells (Marttin et al. 1998). Mucus exhibits non\u00ad Newtonian behaviour, i.e., it possesses both viscous and elastic properties. This enables the mucus to efficiently accept the energy transfered from the cilia, while its elastic properties enable it to relax sufficiently to be propelled towards the nasopharynx, where it is swallowed. The MCS is particularly susceptible to damage. This can be potentially harmful to the patient since impaired mucociliary clearance causes longer contact times of the airway mucosa with bacteria and viruses, which could lead to infections of the respiratory tract. The efficiency of the MCS depends on three factors (Marttin et al. 1998): I) the amount of ciliary input, determined by the length and density of the cilia and their beating frequency, 2) the amount of mucus and the depth of the periciliary layer 3) the viscoelastic properties of the mucus. The effect of chitosan on these factors has been studied. Aspden et al. (1995 and 1997) for example looked at the effect of chitosan on mucociliary transport rates (MTR) in the frog palate model, human turbinates and human volunteers. Th~y found that chitosan had an inhibitory effect on MTR which was greater and more prolonged with higher molecular weight chitosans. Studies on turbinates indicated that cilia continued to beat and that the effect of chitosans on MTR was predominantly physical. Chitosan and mucus . interact to form a viscous and adhesive complex (result of interaction between negatively charged sialic residues of mucus and cationic chitosan molecules), which prevents cilia transporting particles over the surface of the mucus layer. -18-Chapter 1: Introduction In human volunteers, no significant difference was observed in saccharin clearance times recorded before and after 7 days of a daily chitosan application, indicating that the inhibitory effect of chitosan on MTR is transient and results in no permanent damage. It is also important to study the effect of the drugs and other components of the nasal formulation, e.g. preservatives, on the MCS. Marttin et al. (1998) reviewed the effect of drugs and preservatives on the MCS. Studies on insulin and salmon calcitonin showed little to no effect on MTR in the frog palate model and any cilio-inhibition observed in vitro was reversible. The preservative benzalkonium chloride did not alter MTR in humans, though cilio-inhibition and ciliostasis were observed in vitro in chicken embryo tracheas. 1.1.4.2.2 Physicochemical Properties of Drugs 1.1.4.2.2.1 Molecular Weight The effect of physicochemical properties of drug molecules on nasal absorption has been studied by several researchers (Fisher et al. 1987; McMartin et al. 1987; Donovan et al. 1990; Fisher et al. 1991). They found that whilst there was some correlation between charge and degree of hydrophobicity 'of a molecule on absorption, the predominant factor for absorption was the molecular weight of the compounds. Studies on groups of dextrans and polyethylene glycols of varying molecular weight demonstrated that absorption decreased as molecular weight increased. For example, . dextrans of (weight average) molecular weight 1,260 and 45,500 Da had bioavailabHities of 52.7% and 0.6% respectively. In general compounds with a molecular weight greater than 1,000 Da are not likely to result in -19-Chapter 1: Introduction bioavailabilities greater than 10% regardless of physicochemical properties. Nasal absorption fell off sharply at molecular weight > 1,000 Da, while oral absorption declined even more steeply at molecular weights >200 Da. Rapid peaking occurred even when total nasal absorption was low, indicating that a substantial portion of the poorly absorbed compounds are eliminated from the site of absorption either mechanically (mucociliary clearance) or by degradation. 1.1.4.2.2.2 Solubility and Dissolution Rate Drug solubility can limit absorption and can also affect the formulation. For particulate nasal products, administered as either powder inhalation or in the form of suspensions, the dissolution rate of a drug and saturation solubility becomes important. Particles deposited in the nostrils need to be dissolved prior to absorption. If the drug remains as particles, they may be cleared from the nasal cavity and absorption will not occur (Behl et al. 1998). 1.1.4.2.3 Drug Formulation -pH and osmolarity Ohwaki et al. (1985), Pujara et al. (1995) and Behl et al. (1998) studied the effect of formulation variables on the nasal mucosa. The pH of the mt nasal mucosa is 7.39 and the pH of the human nasal mucosa is in the range of 5.5- 6.5. The nasal cavity of mts was perfused with solutions of various pHs and the perfusate examined. Protein release from the nasal mucoSa was maximal at pH 12 and 2 indicating and intracellular damage '(both were released). Buffers within pH values of 3 and 1 o caused very low and similar amounts of total protein release. It was concluded that these pH effects were due to structural changes in the epithelial -20-Chapter 1: Introduction cells, and to avoid nasal irritation, the formulation pH should be adjusted between 4.5 and 6.5. Drug absorption through the nasal mucosa can be substantially affected by formulation tonicity. It was found that the absorption of secretin in rats was affected by the concentration of sodium chloride and absorption reached a maximum at a 0.462M sodium chloride concentration (hypertonic) probably due to the observed shrinkage of epithelial cells. The effect of osmolarity on the nasal epithelium was studied and it was found that pure water of zero osmolarity caused the most mucosal marker leakage due to swelling of the epithelial cells. Isotonic and hypertonic solutions demonstrated very little effect on the LDH release from the nasal epithelium, leading to the conclusion that isotonic and hypertonic solutions are less damaging than hypotonic solutions. In general, an isotonic formulation (0.9% NaCI) is preferable. 1.1.4.2.4 Deposition of drug The clearance of a drug formulation from the nasal cavity is influenced by its site of deposition (Kublik and Vidgren 1998). The turbinates, which are covered by respiratory epithelia, are the primary sites for systemic absorption of nasally administered drugs. Ciliated epithelia are present in the middle and posterior parts of the turbinates, but are almost absent in the anterior regions. A drug deposited posteriorly in the nose is cleared more rapidly than a drug deposited anteriorly, because mucociliary clearance is slower hi the anterior part of the nose. Three different clearance phases following nasal delivery . have been distinguished. The first phase within the first minute after application, mainly applicable for liquid formulations and large application volumes, is a very rapid clearance due to swallowing or run-through of the -21-Chapter 1: Introduction formulation into the pharynx. The following second phase occurring 15-30 minutes after application results from progressive clearance of the material deposited in the ciliated area of the main nasal passages. The part of the dose distributed in the non-ciliated for anterior part of the nose disappears very slowly, this clearance phase lasts over several hours. The second and third phases are claimed to be responsible for the biphasic clearance pattern observed in nearly every deposition study. 1.1.4.3 Formulations for nasal administration Developing an appropriate formulation for a given drug is vitally important. A good drug can be rendered useless, ineffective or mediocre by the choice of an inappropriate formulation. The choice of dosage form depends on the drug being developed, indication being pursed, and patient population. Behl et al. (1998), Kublik and Vidgren (1998), and Hinchcliffe and lllum (1999) reviewed various formulations for nasal drug delivery. 1.1.4.3.1 Solutions and Suspensions Nasal solutions can be administered by simple drops or using sprays. Nasal drops are very simple and represent a convenient form of administering drugs. The development of metered dose nasal actuators enabled the delivery of accurate actuation volumes as low as 25 J.tl. Suspensions can also be administered using metered dose actuators that have been designed to account for the specific particle size and morphology of the drug particles. 1.1.4.3.2 Powders If a suitable solution or suspension of the drug cannot be developed, a dry powder form may be used. Powders are not favourable products since they can cause irritation on the nasal mucosa, and are also more expensive to -22-Chapter 1: Introduction manufacture because of the particle size/morphology considerations. Administration of nasal powders may evidently increase patient compliance, especially for children if the smell and taste of the delivered drug is unacceptable. The powder facilitates the delivery of the highest mass of active ingredient without the necessity of a vehicle. 1.1.4.3.3 Gels Gels are either thickened/gelled solutions or suspensions of drugs. They can offer several advantages over other dosage systems (Behl et al. 1998). For example, a gel can localise the formulation on the mucosa thereby providing a better chance of absorption of the drug. 1.1.4.3.4 Microspheres Current trends in nasal drug delivery methods appear to be focused on the use of microsphere technology (Hussain 1998). By using microspheres formulated using biocompatible materials, e.g. starch, gelation and et al. 1988; IlIum et al. 2001; Janes et al. 2001) a more intimate and prolonged contact between the drug and the mucosal membrane can be achieved allowing increased absorption of the drug. (IlIum et al. 1987 and 1988) have studied nasal delivery using starch microspheres in rats and sheep. Reduced clearance and increased drug absorption occurred due to absorption of water from the epithelial mucosa during the gelling process and resulted in a reversible shrinkage of the epithelial cells. This shrinkage could lead to the physical separation of the intracellular junctions and enhance paraceUular absorption. Soane et al. (1999) compared the clearance of chitosan solution, starch microspheres and chitosan microspheres to a control solution of 99m Tc-DTPA solution (99m-Chapter 1: Introduction Technetium labelled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid). The time taken for 50% clearance of the chitosan solution almost doubled (compared to the control solution) to 41 minutes, whilst the half-life of clearance for the starch microspheres more than tripled to 68 minutes and of chitosan microspheres half-life of clearance quadrupled to 84 minutes. The slow clearance of the chitosan and starch systems can be explained by their bioadhesive properties, and additional dehydration of the mucus layer causing an increase in its viscosity and increasing cilia resistance. The chitosan solution will also interact rapidly with mucins due to its cationic nature, possibly explaining its increased residence time. The effects of various microsphere systems on the bioavailability of the peptide insulin have been studied. Starch and dextrin microspheres. cross\u00ad linked with epichlorohydrin were studied in rats (Edman et al. 1992). Both systems caused a rapid reduction in glucose levels after nasal administration with a maximal reduction observed within 30-40 minutes. Starch microspheres were more effective than dextrin microspheres in reducing blood sugar levels. A study by Farraj et al. (1990) using starch microspheres in sheep appeared to show that the absolute bioavailability of insulin from the starch microspheres was 4.5% compared to about 1 % for a solution of insulin without absorption enhancers. IlIum et al. (1994) studied the use of hyaluronic acid ester tnicrospheres as a nasal delivery system for insulin in sheep. The microsphere system evidently produced large and significant increases in nasal absorption similar to those obtained for bioadhesive starch microspheres. The mean relative bioavailability was claimed to be 11 % when compared with insulin administered by the subcutaneous route. -24-Chapter 1: Introduction 1.1.4.3.5 Nanoparticies It has been considered that chitosan nanoparticles, like microspheres, would intensify the contact between the protein and nasal absorptive mucosa, leading to increased protein concentration at the absorption site (Femandez-Urrusuno et al. 1999). Studies in vivo showed that administration of insulin loaded chitosan nanoparticles prepared using ionotropic gelation with TPP resulted in a fall in glucose levels after nasal administration (Femandez-Urrusuno et al. 1999). For this effect to be observed the insulin released from the nanoparticles has to be in its active form indicating that the preparation method was not harmful to the protein. Further studies by Dyer et al. (2002) in rat and sheep models also appeared to show a fall in glucose levels after nasal administration of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with insulin. In vitro release of insulin from chitosan nanoparticles appears to be dependent on the pH of the surrounding medium. Release is evidently rapid at pH 7.4 and pH 4, but slightly slower at pH 6.4. (Femandez-Urrusuno et al. 1999). This could be attributed to the lower solubility of insulin at pH 6.4 (9.4 J.lglml) compared to at pH 7.4 (834 J.lg/ml) and pH 4 (> 1 mglml). Release of insulin in water was claimed by these researchers to be much slower than in a buffered medium suggesting that the interaction forces between insulin and chitosan are reversible and very weak, and that insulin releases from the nanoparticles by a simple dissolution mechanism (Femandez-Vrrusuno et al. 1999; Janes et al. 2001). In conclusion, chitosan nanoparticles display several attractive features for the delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides: -25-Chapter 1: Introduction fonnation under extremely mild conditions great capacity for association of proteins release rates of different rates depending on composition increased absorption due to bioadhesive and absorption enhancing nature of chitosan. 1.2 Chitosan and Degradation 1.2.1 Chitosan Chitosan is a derivative of chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide after cellulose \u00abParadossi et al. 1992; OtWy et al. 1996; Boryniec et al. 1997\u00bb. Chitin is a linear polysaccharide consisting of N-acetyl-D- glucosamine units (Glc-NAc), and the tenn chitosan refers to a series of deacetylated chitins containing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units arid D\u00b7 glucosamine units (Glc-N) in varying proportions. The structure of chitosan is shown in Figure 1-1. 1.2.1.1 Production of Chitosan Chitin is an abundant biopolymer like cellulose and is distributed in the shells of crustacea, e.g. crab and shrimp, the cuticle of insects and also in the cell wall of some fungi and micro-organisms (Anthonsen et al. 1993; Sugimoto et al. 1998). Chitosan can be obtained by commercial N-deacetylation of chitin, after its isolation from, for example, the shells of crabs (Anthonsen et al. 1993; Varum et al. 1994). Demineralisation is carried out at room temperature in hydrochloric acid, followed by deproteination using alkaline treatment in sodium hydroxide at 80-85\u00b0C (Tolaimate et al. 2000). Deacetylation is then carried out using strong alkaline solution (--40% w/w) at high temperatures -26-Chapter 1: Introduction (~80\u00b0C). The influence of alkaline concentration and temperature have been investigated by Chang et al. (1997), who found that the kinetics of homogeneous and heterogeneous alkaline N-deacetylation was first order, i.e. the rate of deacetylation was directly proportional to the alkaline concentration and the reaction temperature. Temperature and alkaline concentration dramatically affected the rate of deacetylation, which increased with increasing temperature and alkaline concentration. The resulting degree of acetylation was found to be proportional to the reaction time (Rege and Block 1999; Tolaimate et al. 2000). As well as the occurrence deacetylation, degradation of chitin ,uso takes place during the deacetylation process due to the high concentration of alkaline solution and the prolonged reaction times required to obtain significant deacetylation (Tolaimate et al. 2000). Under the most drastic conditions, the molecular weight can decrease by a factor of about 5-10. To achieve a desired degree of acetylation, the process may normally have to be repeated several times. However, Tolaimate et al. (2000) found that after two repeated alkaline steps the desired degree o~ acetylation can be obtained and that further reaction steps only lead to depolymerisation. -27-Chapter 1: Introduction Figure 1-1: Scbematic Structure of Cbi to san; R=acetyl or H, in water at neutral and basic pH-values (Varum et al. 1994), however it is soluble in aqueous acidic solution. When dissolved in acidic media it becomes a polyelectrolyte due to the protonation of the -NH2 groups, and the following equilibriuin reaction occurs (Rinaudo et al. 1999): Chitosan differs from other polysaccharides in two main ways: The term chitosan does not refer to a defined structure but to a group of polysaccharides, whose structures differ depending on the DA. The DA describes the ratio of N-acetylated to deacetylated subunits. A structure consisting of only N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units would be described as having a DA of 100%, while a structure consisting of only D-glucosamine units has a DA of 0%. In aqueous acidic media chitosan is a cationic polyelectrolyte and the conformation of the chitosan molecule depends on the composition of the solvent (especially the ionic strength). An uncharged flexible polymer molecule may take on any configuration compatible with its bond length and angles and other steric restrictions. This is also possible for charged polymer molecules, however, each configuration will have different free energies, with a relatively high free energy for compact configurations and a relatively low free energy for expanded ones. The lower the free energy of a molecule, the more stable it is, therefore polyelectrolytes tend 10 have an expanded configuration. -29-Chapter 1: Introduction Changing the composition of the solvent, mainly the ionic strength, may alter the configuration of a charged molecule. At low ionic strength the polymer molecule has a more extended conformation. As the ionic strength is increased, the molecule will become less extended. This is due to shielding of the charges on the molecule as the ionic strength increases and thus less expansion is required to reduce the free energy of the molecule (Tanford 1961). Chitosan can also be characterised by its molecular weight. In Chapter 3 the molecular weight of several chitosans are determined using several hydrodynamic techniques, the details of which are found in Chapter 2. These techniques include analytical ultracentrifugation and light scattering. Chitosan is also a polydisperse material, that is, the sample will contain a range of different molecular weights. The techniques therefore measure an average molecular weight and this is discussed in more details in Chapter 2. 1.2.1.3 Conformation The gross conformation and chain flexibility of chitosan in solution may be affected by solvent conditions, nam~ly ionic strength, pH and tempemture of the solution, as well as the molecular weight and degree of acetylation of the chitosan used (Tsaih and Chen 1997). The conformation of chitosan in solution may be affected by the DA of the chitosan in two possible ways: By the presence of bulky acetyl groups -due to steric hindmnce, chitosan with the highest DA should therefore hold the most expanded conformation By the number of positive charge from free amino groups in acidic solutions. Positive charges in solution will repel each other. The -30-Chapter 1: Introduction chitosan with lowest DA will have the highest amount of amino groups and hence the highest charge effect. The repulsive effect will be highest and the chitosan will have the most expanded conformation. This effect is most important at very low ionic strengths. At high ionic strengths, repulsion is largely suppressed due to screening effects of the added salt: the electrostatic contribution to chain stiffness becomes small. For chitosan to be soluble, it needs to have a DA of less than 50%. Below this DA, half of the residues will possess a charged group in acidic solution, and it may be expected that the charge effects will determine the conformation. Ellipsoid modelling and bead modelling can be used to represent the conformation of quasi-rigid systems such as proteins. However, the stringent assumptions that are used make these modelling techniques unsuitable for flexible systems such as many polysaccharides: their polydispersity also adds to the complications. For polysaccharides, the Mark-Houwink-Kuhn-Sakurada exponents can be used to distinguish between classes of conformation (compact sphere, rigid rod and random coil). The MHKS equation relates intrinsic viscosity to molecular weight as shown: [17]=kMQ (1-2) where [17] is the intrinsic viscosity, M the molecular weight, a the MHKS exponent and k the MHKS constant (see for example Harding 1997). -31-Chapter 1: Introduction Table 1-1 shows the values for the MHKS exponent that relate to different conformations. Table 1-1: Relationship between polymer conformation and MHKS exponent o Sphere 0.5 ~O.8 Random coil 1.8 Rod shape Anthonsen et al. (1993) found that for chitosans dissolved in a O.IM ionic strength solution, as the DA increases the value of the Mark-Houwink-Kuhn\u00ad Sakurada exponent a increases.As DA increases the number of NH3 + groups will decrease, therefore the electrostatic repulsion will decrease. It would be expected that the chitosan molecule would become more compact, however the opposite occurs. This indicates that at an ionic strength of O.IM, it is the influence of the N-acetyl groups rather than the electrostatic effects of charged amino groups that determine the extension of the chitosan chain. Similar results from viscosity and light scattering measurements have been obtained (Wang et al. 1991). Draining effects may also have a significant effect on the value of a (see for example Berth et al, 2002). The Haug triangle is a graphical way of representing the relation between the three conformation extremes -sphere, rod and coil (Smidsmd and Andtesen 1979). The extremes of conformation are placed at the corners of the triangle and the conformation of a given macromolecule can then be represented by a locus along the perimeter of the triangle. For example, a globular protein would be represented by a locus somewhere between the extremes of sphere -32-Chapter 1: Introduction and rod (side A), a polysaccharide, DNA or a mucus glycoprotein between rod and coil (side B) and a denatured protein between coil and sphere (side C). Figure 1-2: Haug triangle representation ofthe gross conformation ofmaeromoleeules Compact sphere B Random coil / Rigid rod Polysaccharides are best represented by the worm-like chain model that allows for continuous flexibility throughout the polymer chain. Generally the more charged a polysaccharide is, the more rod-like its conformation. Highly charged polyanions such as pectin and polycations like chitosan have behaviour approaching that of stiff rods, whereas those of low or no charge behave more like random coils e.g. pullalan. The flexibility of these worm- like chains can be represented by various parameters such as the ratio L/Lc, the ratio of the contour length of the chain to its persistence length. In the limits L/Lc ~ 0 arid L/Lc ~ ex:> the conformation is and random coil respectively. -33-Chapter 1: Introduction Figure 1-3: The persistence length Lp and contour length Le of a linear macromolecule (Harding 1997) ~'P ..... -----..... on the stiffness/flexibility of a polysaccharide can be determined from relations between intrinsic viscosity and ionic strength. The simplest is the \"Smidsroo\" stiffness parameter B, which is defined by: where the exponent v equals 1.3, and S is measured from a plot of [r11 versus I and the equation [17] = [171 + ( S.r JIJ. ) Flory and co-workers also estimated the stiffness of a macromolecule using the characteristic ratio Coo: where <h2> is the mean square end to end distance, n is the number of segments in the chain and I is the length of each segment. Coo ~ 1 holds only for a perfectly flexible chain. In practical terms, flexible coils appear to have values of Coo ~ 1-10 whereas very stiff polymers have Coo > ~ 25-400. Coo can be estimated from the intercept of a plot of [T)]1M11l verSus MIll together with knowledge of the residue length I and residue molecular weight. 1.2.2 Degradation Chitosan, like all polysaccharides, will degrade over time, mainly due to hydrolysis of the ~(l--.4) linkage between the monomers (BeMiller 1967). This normally happens faster with chitosan in solution than in the solid state -34-Chapter 1: Introduction (Holme et al. 2001). In order to market a drug formulation it is necessary to ensure that the bioavailability and pharmacological effectiveness of the drug are not compromised over a specified shelf life, e.g. three years (Aulton 2002). Various factors will affect the rate of degradation of chitosan, including temperature, pH, and ionic strength (BeMiller 1967). Looking at the kinetics of polymer degradation, the simplest model assumes that all the bonds of the macromolecular chain are equally susceptible to rupture, and that rate of rupture is proportional to the number of bonds remaining. The degradation process is non-specific and can be describe as \"random scission degradation\" (Tanford 1961). In random scission degradation the rate at which bonds are broken is proportional to the total number of intact bonds: -/ct P == poe (1-5) where Po is the initial number of bonds and p is the number of bonds at time t. The degradation of a polymer can often be measured experimentally by change in molecular weight ~ a function of time, using light scattering or viscosity as a measure of molecular weight. These techniques can only be applied if the molecular weight remains large throughout the course of the experiment. In this case, p will remain close to unity and so will e-kt Therefore equation (1-5) can be rewritten as: p = Po(1-la) (1-6) and the change in the degree of polymerisation will be a linear function of time: -35-Chapter 1: Introduction This method of determining the rate of degradation can be applied to polysaccharides as has been demonstrated using cellulose. The degradation of cellulose was studied using hydrolysis by phosphoric acid and the rate constant increased with increasing concentration of phosphoric acid (Tanford 1961). 1.2.2.1 Acid Hydrolysis The rate of acid hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages in model compounds such as methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-P-D-glucopyranose and methyl-2- amino-2-deoxy-p-D-glucopyranose has been determined, and it was shown that the N-acetylated methyl-glucosaminide was hydrolysed much faster than the corresponding de-N-acetylated sugar (Varum et al. 2001). Varum et al. (2001) also measured the degradation rate constants for chitosan as a function of acid concentration. It was found that the degradation rate increased in direct proportion to the acid concentration (0.01M < [HCI] < 0.8M), which indicated that acid hydrolysis was the mechanism by which chitosan was degraded. Degradation was also measured as a function of degree of acetylation. Degradation increased with increasing degree of acetylation. Degradation of a less acetylated chitosan is believed to be slower due the protonation of the amine group in acidic conditions. The protonated amine group shields the glycosidic oxygen from protonation, which is the first step in the acid hydrolysis reaction (Roberts 1992). Acid hydrolysis causes depolymerisation by hydrolysis of the O-glycosidic linkage, however, at the same time deacetylation occurs by of the N-acetyl linkage. In (0.1M rate of and depolymerisation have been showri to be similar (Varum et al. 2001), whereas -36-Chapter 1: Introduction in concentrated acid (l2.08M HCI) the rate of hydrolysis was more than ten times higher than the rate of deacetylation. There was also a high specificity observed for the hydrolysis reaction in concentrated acid, such that the linkages between two acetylated units (A-A) and between an acetylated and a deacetylated unit (A-D) were cleaved with about equal rate and three orders of magnitude faster than the other two linkages (D-A and D-D). These studies were undertaken at high temperatures (60-80\u00b0C) which would not be encountered under normal storage conditions for a pharmaceutical formulation. The effects of acidic conditions under normal storage conditions are investigated in Chapter 4. -37 .. Chapter 1: Introduction Figure 1-4: Schematic illustration of mechanism for acid hydrolysis of glycosidic chitosan (from VArum + Oxidative Reductive Degradation (ORD) Chitosan can also be degraded in the presence of molecular oxygen. ORD involves a series of free radical reactions that ultimately lead to chain scission. Reducing compounds are oxidised yielding peroxide. The decomposition of peroxide is catalysed by transition metals and leads to the. formation of free radicals. The free radicals will be involved in a series of chain reactions, some of which result in the attack on the polymer chain. The \"Polymer radical\" is unstable, and further reactions of unknown mechanisms result in cleavage of glycosidic bonds (Pettersen et al. 1997). Free radical degradation of chitosan using hydrogen peroxide has been extensively studied (Chang et al. 1999; Qin et al. 2002). When peroxide is dissolved in water it can dissociate into hydrogen ions and perhydroxyl ions (equation 1 ~8). The perhydroxyl to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (HO') (equation 1 ~ 10). Like other natural polysaccharides, chitosan also containS measurable traces of metal ions, e.g. iron and copper. These metal ions can catalyse the decomposition of H2~, and Fenton type reactions would be feasible. These reactions may also occur in a phannaceutical formulation since the trace metal ~ons will be present. -39-Chapter 1: Introduction (1-10) The hydroxyl radical reacts with carbohydrates exceedingly rapidly abstracting a C-bonded H atom (hydrogen abstraction) according to the general equation (1-11): (1-11) Chang et al. studied the effect of adding different free radical scavengers and metal chelators to the degradation of chitosan by hydrogen peroxide. It was found that EDTA slightly decreased the chitosan degradation as measured by a decrease in the extent of viscosity reduction, which indicated that when some of the metal ions were chelated, the reaction rate decreased. However, the reaction was not completely blocked suggesting that the EDTA-metal ion complex could still participate in chitosan degradation. Some metal ions may also form complexes with chitosan and these were not inhibited by EDTA. Tanioka et al. (1996) also studied the effect of EDTA on depolymerisation using copper ions. It was found that EDT A only inhibited depolymerisation when added before initiation of the reaction. Cu(II) coordinates to three -NH2 and one -OH groups to form intramolecular twisted chelate. EDTA showed no protection when added during the reaction possibility due to its low ability to withdraw Cu(II) from the chitosan-Cu(II) complex. It was also found that chitin was not depolymerised by the Cu(II)-ascorbate system, suggesting that the free amino group of glucosamine is important in the depolymerisation of chitosan (Tanioka et al. 1996). -40-Chapter 1: Introduction Interestingly, when chitosan was degraded by H202 in HCI solution, the rate of degradation was not proportional to the concentration of HCI as described in section 1.2.2.1. In 0.23% HCI (PH 5.5), chitosan degraded more rapidly and its molecular weight dropped to 2.64 x 103 in two hours, whereas, in 9% HCl, the molecular weight only declined to 21.2 x 104 (Qin et al. 2002). At too low a concentration of HCI, chitosan was not dissolved completely, and the strong acidity of 9% HCI inhibited the degradation. This may be due to the protonation of the amino group as suggested by Roberts (1992), and in that study the reduction in molecular weight was due to oxidative cleavage of the chitosan chain. 1.2.2.3 Ultrasonic degradation and radiation Chitosans can also be degraded by ultrasonic treatment and radiation. The principle behind these physical means of degradation is that the added energy needed to break chemical bonds is provided by the energy source. Chen et al. (1997) studied the effect of ultrasonic treatment on the degradation of chitosan under various conditions. It was found that chitosan was degraded faster in dilute solutions, possibly due the increased available energy per unit length of molecule. Raising the reaction temperature resulted in a lower degradation rate, suggesting that elevating the solution temperature is detrimental to the degradation process by ultrasonics. Degradation increased with prolonged .. ultrasonic time, andchitosan was degraded during storage in an acidic solution at ambient temperatures. Boryniec et al. (1997) studied the effect of y- radiation from a 60Co source on chitosan degradation. The results suggested that the degradation was random and independent of the macromolecular structure and chemical composition of the polymer chains. -41-Chapter 1: Introduction 1.2.2.4 Enzymatic Degradation Chitosan can be by, for chitinases, chitosanases, and lysozymes (Shigemasa al. 1994). can catalyse the cleavage of the D-Glucosamine reducing end, while chitinase type enzymes can catalyse the cleavage of the N-acetyl-D- glucosamine reducing ends. The DA of chitosan plays an important role in the activity of these enzymes (Shin-ya et al. 200 I). Chitinase showed increased activity with increasing DA, while chitosanase showed decreased activity with increasing DA. Degradation using pectinase increased with increasing DA (Shin-ya et al. 2001). The hydrolysis of chitosan by lysozyme is reported to be the most important depolymerisation mechanism in human serum (Varum et al. 1997). The degradation rate in human serum increased as the degree of acetylation increased. The same increase was also observed with hen egg white and human lysozyme (Varum et al. t 997). This will be important for oral delivery formulations since there is a large amount of proteolytic enzymes present in the stomach and in the small intestine. The specificity of chitosan degradation using lysozyme was studied by Varum et al. (1996). Using NMR spectroscopy the identity of the new reducing ends could be determined. In the study these were found to be exclusively N- acetyl-D-glucosamine subunits. This shows that the active cleft of lysozyme has a much higher affinity for N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units than for D- glucosamine units. -42-Chapter 1: Introduction 1.3 Aims and Objectives The objectives of this thesis were as follows: to characterise the hydrodynamic behaviour of a range of chitosans (varying in molecular weight and degree of acetylation). Of particular interest was the use of a combination of hydrodynamic techniques, namely analytical ultracentrifugation, SEC-MALLS and viscometry, to determine the influence of DA on chain conformation. The validity of molecular weight measurements using SEC-MALLS was investigated and results compared to those obtained using sedimentation equilibrium experiment on the AUC. to obtain information on the degradation mechanisms and rate of . degradation of chitosan under various storage conditions. The degradation was monitored using viscosity and molecular weight measurements (SEC\u00b7 MALLS and AUC) to obtain quantitative measures of degradation rates. to prepare chitosan nanoparticles using the counterion tripolyphosphate pentasodium (TPP) which could be used to deliver insulin or other therapeutics proteinsJpeptides across the nasal mucosa. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of nanoparticles prepared using different ratios of TPP and chitosan was studied and the effect of complexation on the degradation rate of chitosan was also investigated. . -43-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 2.1 Materials 2.1.1 Solvents The main solvent used in this work was a O.2M acetate buffer (PH 4.3). This was prepared by dissolving 12.01g1l acetic acid and 7.994g1l NaCI in pure water and adjusting to pH 4.29 with monovalent strong base or acid as needed. Acetate buffers of different ionic strengths and pH were prepared by altering the quantities of acid and NaCl accordingly and adjusted to the desired pH using monovalent strong acid or base. 2.1.2 Chitosan Chitosan samples were kindly supplied by Pronova Ltd., Drammen, Norway. These highly purified samples were used as supplied, and the physicochemical details for each sample can be found in Table 3.1, Chapter 3. 2.1.3 Insulin Human zinc insulin (26.3 IU/mg) was obtained from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, USA). 2.1.4 Other Materials All other materials were of analytical grade and supplied by Sigma, UK. 2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Analytical Ultracentrifugation , The Analytical Ultracentrifuge (AUC) was invented by The Svedberg in 1923 (Schachman 1992) and can be used to determine the molecular weight, and assess the size, shape and homogeneitylheterogeneity of macromolecular samples e.g. proteins and polysaccharides. Although the basic principles of sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium were established over -44-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 50 years ago, the modem delivery (instrumentation, data capture and analysis software) makes it a very attractive tool for macromolecular characterisation in solution. 2.2.1.1 Optical Systems Three different optical systems can be used to collect data from the ADC (Lloyd 1974): 1. Absorption Optics 2. Interference Optics 3. Schlieren Optics Absorption optics depends on the macromolecule of interest containing a chromophore. Chitosan does not possess a chromophore in the useable part of the DV spectrum unless chemically modified and hence this optical system has not been used in this project and will not be discussed here. Both Interference optics and Schlieren optics depend on the refractive index of the sample. 2.2.1.1.1 Interference Optics An interference pattern is produced by splitting a beam of coherent light and passing it through paired sectors of a cell in a spinning rotor (Lloyd 1974). The speed of light will be altered as it passes through these sectors, to an extent dependent upon the refractive index. When the beams are merged after passage through the sectors, the waves combine to form an interference pattern. Ifboth sectors are identical in length and contain identical solutions, a pattern of straight (Le. undeviated) interferences fringes will be produced when the beams are recombined. However, if one sector contains a reference solvent and the other contains the same solvent but containing also the dissolved sample of interest, the greater concentration in the sample sector will -45-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods alter the light vector as it passes through that solution more than will be the case in the reference sector. When these beams are recombined, the fringe pattern will be shifted to an extent that corresponds to the concentration difference between the sectors. The fringe shift is related to the concentration by the classical relationship: J=a(An)/A (2-1) where J is the fringe shift, equivalent to the differential number of wavelengths between the solvent and the solution, a is the length of the light path through the sample or solvents compartments, A is the wavelength of the light, and An is the refractive index difference between the solvent and solution. Since the refractive index is generally proportional to concentration, the fringe shift can be used to follow the redistribution of sample as a function of radius in the sample sector (Furst 1997). 2.2.1.1.2 Schlieren Optics on the Model E ultracentrifuge Schlieren optics, like interference optics, is based on the refractive index of the solution (Clewlow et al. 1997). Light passing through a region in the cell where concentration (and hence refractive index) is changing will be deviated radially, as light passing through a prism is deviated towards the direction normal to the surface. The schlieren optical system converts the radial deviation of light into a vertical displacement of an image at the camera .. This displacement is proportional to the concentration gradient. Light passing through either pure solvent or a uniform concentration will not be deviated radially, and the image will not be vertically displaced in those regions. The -46-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods schlieren image is thus a measure of the concentration gradient, dc/dr, as a function of radial distance, r. 2.2.1.2 Sedimentation Velocity In sedimentation velocity, a sample is spun at high speed (usually 40-60 K rpm) in the analytical ultracentrifuge until the macromolecule has sedimented to the base of the cell. Here follows a summary of the technique (Ralston 1993). Figure 2-1: Forces acting on a solute particle in a gravitational field (from Ralston 1993) ID I r = a; mernscus :::::=::::::::::_-...----1-:r----~~ r = b; bottom --- r When a solute particle suspended in a solvent is placed in a gravitational field, it is subject to three forces acting on it (Figure 2-1). These are: 1. Sedimenting or gravitational force. 2 M 2 F = m{J) r = -(J) r S N A (2 -2) In a spinning rotor, the acceleration of a particle is determined by the product of its distance from the axis of rotation, r, and, the square of the angular velocity, (J) (in radians per second). The gravitational force is the product of the mass, m, of a single particle and the accelaration. -47-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods M is the molar mass (\"molecular weight\") of the solute in glmol and NA is Avogadro's number. 2. Buoyant force. F 2 -2 b = -mow r =-mvpco r (2 -3) The buoyant force is related to the weight of fluid displaced, where mo is the mass of fluid displaced by the particle, v the partial specific volume and p the solution density. 3. Frictional force. Fj =-fu (2-4) A particle moving through a viscous fluid will experience a frictional drag that is proportional to the velocity and the frictional coefficient, f, which depends on the shape and size of the particle. When a high centrifugal force is applied, the solute particles initially accelerate, but quickly reach a terminal velocity, u. At this point the three forces come into balance: M (l-vp)w2r-fu=O (2-6) NA The particles rapidly deplete from the region nearest the centre of the rotor (the meniscus region at the air/solution interface), forming a boundary which moves toward the outside of the rotor with time until finally all the macromolecules form a pellet at the base of the cell (Figure 2-2). -48-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods Figure 2-2: Position of solvent and sample menisci in a double sector centrepiece and boundary formed by sedimenting particles (from Ralston 1993\u00bb.

From this equation it is apparent that the sedimentation coefficient depends on: Molecular properties of the sedimenting particle, such as: molecular weight, M, partial specific volume, v and shape (via the frictional coefficient, f). Properties of the solution: density, p and viscosity 1'/ (since f depends on this). It is also possible to calculate the molecular weight from the sedimentation coefficient using the Svedberg equation (Price and Dwek 1979): M= RTs D(l-vp) (2 -8) where R is the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, and D is the translational diffusion coefficient which can be determined from the rate of spreading of the sedimenting boundary. However, sedimentation velocity is ineffective for polydisperse samples such as chitosan, since boundary spreading measurements are masked by polydispersity. For these systems dynamic light scattering is probably the method of choice (Ralston 1993). -50-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 2.2.1.2.1 Analysis 0/ data using DCDT+ software At set time intervals during a sedimentation velocity experiment, scans are taken of the solute concentration across the centrifuge cell. Using the DCDT+ software (Philo 2000), a series of approximately ten consecutive scans are selected after the sedimenting boundary has travelled approximately 213 across the cell length. The sedimentation coefficient distribution function, g(s*), can then be derived. This represents the change in concentration distribution across the cell with time, when different components will have undergone radial dilution to a different extent. This is normally corrected to g(s*), the apparent distribution when the sample was loaded. It is possible to fit individual peaks in the g(s*) distribution to Oaussian functions and determine bOth the sedimentation coefficient (from the centre position) for individual species and for monodisperse systems the diffusion coefficient (from the width of the Gaussian peak). The sedimentation coefficient is converted to standard conditions (solvent - water; temperature -20\u00b0C) to account for differences in density and viscosity of the solvent using in terms of the standard solvent . . water at 20\u00b0C; Sobs is the measured sedimentation coefficient in the experimental solvent at temperature T; TJT,w and TJ20,w are the viscosities of water at the temperature of the experiment and at 20orespectively; TJs and TJw are the viscosities of the solvent and water at a common temperature; Plo,w is the density of water at 20\u00b0C and Pr,s the density of the solvent at the temperature of the solvent. -51-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods 2.2.1.2.2 Dependence of Sedimentation CoeffICient on Concentration Sedimentation coefficients measured at a finite concentration will be apparent ones because of the effects of non-ideality. Apparent sedimentation coefficients are therefore concentration dependent (Wales and Holde 1954), the measured apparent sedimentation coefficient decreases with increasing concentration. By measuring the apparent sedimentation coefficient at a series of concentration and extrapolated to zero concentration, the infinite dilution sedimentation coefficient (s~o,w) can be determined using the equation: (2 -10) The concentration dependence arises from the increased viscosity of the solution at higher concentrations, and from the fact that sedimenting solute particles must displace solvent backwards as they sediment. Both effects become extremely small as concentration is decreased. The concentration-dependence coefficient, ks, is a useful property for indicating molecular shape. It has been shown that the relationship \"kJ['I']]\" ~ 1.6 for spherical particles and random coils, and tends towards --<>.2 for rod- like particles (independent of particle size) (Harding 1995). 2.2.1.3 Sedimentation Equilibrium In sedimentation equilibrium the sample is\u00b7 spun in an analytical ultracentrifuge at a. low speed, which causes the macromolecule to move towards the outside of the rotor. As the macromolecule sediments towards the base of the cell, diffusion acts to oppose the sedimentation process. After a period of time, usually 2-3 days, a balance is reached between the sedimentation and diffusion processes, and a concentration distribution is -52-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods fonned that increases exponentially towards the cell base. This distribution depends only on molecular mass of the macromolecule and is entirely independent of the shape of the molecule. By measurement of concentration at different points in this distribution, the molecular weight can be determined. For a single, ideal, non-associating solute, the molecular weight can be calculated from the following equation: M = 2RT dIne w (l-Vp)(i}2 dr2 (2-11) However, due to non-ideality, an apparent weight-average molecular weight is obtained from sedimentation equilibrium that will tend to be lower than the true molecular weight. By extrapolation of the reciprocal of the apparent weight average molecular weight to zero concentration the true molecular weight can be obtained: l/Mw,app = (i/MwXl+ 2BMwc) (2 -12) where pressure\" second virial coefficient. solute vs. radius/distance from meniscus) obtained from sedimentation equilibrium experiment can be analysed using MSTAR program (COlfen and Harding 1997) to obtain a value for Mw,lIPP\" Using the MSTAR program, an operational point average (Le. a function of radial distance at a point in the ultracentrifuge cell from the axis of rotation) molecular weight (M*) is calculated. This is defined by (Creeth and Harding 1982): -53-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods M a=--__ _ (2 -13) = (1 -v p)w 2 , c is the polymer concentration at r (radial distance 2RT from centre of rotation) or a, the meniscus. Mw,app is calculated by extrapolation of M* to the base of the cell. 2.2.1.3.2 Lamm Equation Data obtained using the Schlieren optical system on the model E differs from that obtained on the XLI AUC. The data obtained here is in the form of concentration difference vs. distance from centre of rotation and can be analysed by fitting to the Lamm equation (Clewlow et al. 1997) to obtain Mz (2 -14) where n is the refractive index, r the radial position from the centre of the rotor, p is the density of solvent, Mz,app the z-average apparent molecular weight, ro the angular velocity of the rotor, R the gas constant and T the absolute temperature. A graph of ~.;. : ) versus r2 has a slope proportional to the z-average molecular weight (Mz,app). The data set can be transformed by integrating with respect to r, distance from meniscus, and analysed using MSTAR program to obtain Mw,app (Colfen and Harding 1997). 2.2.2 Viscometry the viscosity of a solution is a measure of its resistance to flow. By adding a substance to a solvent, its viscosity will increase since the frictional forces -54-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods associated with the system increase. Herein follows a summary of the technique (Harding 1997). The effect of this added macromolecule on the viscosity of the solvent can be described by the relative viscosity, l1rel or the reduced viscosity, l1red: (2 -15) where TJ is the viscosity of the solution, TJo is the viscosity of the solvent, TJsp is the specific viscosity and C is the concentration. Due to non-ideality, the reduced viscosity of a solution shows concentration dependence, increasing with increasing concentration. The intrinsic viscosity, [11], of a macromolecule is defined as the limit as concentration tends to zero. Two forms of extrapolation can be used to calculate the intrinsic viscosity. The Huggins equation: TJred = [TJ]{1 + KH[TJ]c) or the Kraemer equation: -55-(2 -17) Chapter 2: Materials and Methods Figure 2-3: Huggins and Kraemer plot for intrinsic viscosity. The common intercept gives [11], the slope are Ku[ 11)2 and KK[ 11]2. Ku is the Huggins constant and KK the Kraemer constant. (Modified from Jume11994) ~ 6 ... ! ~ ....

Materials and Methods 2.2.2.1 Capillary Viscometer Viscosity measurements are performed by measuring the time for a solution (volume, V ~ usually 2ml) of a macromolecule dissolved in a solvent of viscosity 110 to flow through a narrow capillary tube of radius r and length L under hydrostatic pressure. The viscosity of the sample solution, T'j, given by: 1thgpr41 11 = 8LV (2-19) where h is the average liquid height; g the gravitational acceleration; and p the density of solution. Since the flow times of the solvent (110) and of various concentrations of the macromolecule (11) are carried out under identical experimental conditions, the relative viscosity can be calculated from: 11 Ip 117 =-=-- 110 10 Po (2-20) where I and 10 are the flow times of the solution and solvent respectively; and pand Po, the density of the solution and solvent respectively. Since the concentrations used for polysaccharides are usually sufficiently small \u00ab5mglinl) to neglect density corrections, it is reasonable to assume that kinematic viscosity parameters (no density correction) are approximately equal to dynamic viscosity parameters (corrected for density differences). (Tanford 1955) The intrinsic viscosity can then be calculated by extrapolation using the Huggins or Kraemer plot. -57-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods h Capillary Figure 2-4: Ostwald capillary viscometer (Van Holde 1971) Materials Methods 2.2.2.2 Determination of Intrinsic Viscosity The intrinsic viscosity of each chitosan sample was determined using the Ostwald capillary viscometer which was suspended in a temperature controlled water bath at 20.0\u00b0C. A 5 mg/ml chitosan solution was prepared in 0.2M acetate buffer, pH 4.3. 2 ml of this solution is transferred to the Ostwald capillary viscometer and suspended in the water bath for 10 minutes to ensure the sample is at 20,0\u00b0C prior to measurement of flow time. The flow time of the sample is recorded ten times and an average taken. The original sample is diluted using 0.2M acetate buffer, pH 4.3 to give a range of concentrations between 1 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml. The flow times for these diluted samples is recorded in the same way. The flow time is also recorded for the solvent (0.2 M acetate buffer, pH 4.3). For each sample concentration the reduced viscosity is calculated using equation (2-16). The reduced viscosities are then plotted against concentrations and the intrinsic viscosity is calculated by extrapolation to infinite dilution (Huggins method). 2.2.2.3 Determination of chitosan degradation using viscosity measurements The viscosity of a macromolecule is related to its molecular weight using the Mark-Houwink-Kuhn-Sakarada equation -[17] = K'MQ (Harding 1997). At solution concentration of 1 mg/ml the reduced viscosity of a chitosan solution is approximately equal to its intrinsic viscosity. Therefore changes in the reduced viscosity of a chitosan solution can be used as an indication of degradation that has occurred over a period of time. The reduced viscosity of a chitosan solution is measured at the beginning of a storage trial. At two week intervals, a 2 ml aliquot of the sample is taken and the reduced viscosity measured. The change in reduced viscosity is used to -59-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods assess the degradation of chitosan under different storage conditions as examined in Chapters 4 and 5. 2.2.2.4 Concentration dependence of viscosity As the concentration of a solution increases the relationship between viscosity and concentration is directly proportional. However, above a certain concentration a sharp increase in viscosity is observed. The cocnetration at which this occurs is known as the \"Critical Overlap Concentration -C*\". This can be clearly seen using a double logarithmic plot of T/sp against concentration (Morris et al. 1981). The increase in the gradient of the plot is due to the change from dilute solution conditions, where individual polymer molecules exist as isolated coils, to concentrated solutions where significant coil overlaps begins to occur. The concentration at which C* occurs is generally between 0.4 -0.8 mg/ml for polysaccharides (Harding 1997). 2.2.3 Size Exclusion Chromatography Laser (SEC-MALLS) 2.2.3.1 Size-Exclusion Chromatography Chitosan is a polydisperse polymer, that comprises of a normally broad range of molecular weights. Chromatography can be used to separate the solution into different molecular weight fractions. Size-exclusion chromatography, as the name suggests, separates the chitosan sample into fractions of different sizes or molecular weight. The chitosan solution passes through a series of columns which are packed with beads of varying size. High molecular weight fractions are excluded from passing through the pores created between the packing material and pass through the columns faster than lower molecular weight fractions which are able to migrate into the packing material increasing their elution time. The results is that high molecular weight fractions elute -60-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods first and that a molecular weight distribution can then be obtained using the light scattering cell which is connected in series. 2.2.3.2 Multi-Angle Laser Light Scattering The measurement of molecular weight by light scattering makes use of the intensity of the light scattered at some angle e as a function of the intensity impinging on the scattered volume, V (Wyatt 1993). In solution, light scattering data can be interpreted according to the fluctuation theory of light scattering which states that light is scattered as a result of changes of polarizability of the solution due to random fluctuations in the solute concentration in small volume elements. Based on this, the relationship between the Rayleigh excess factor and the physical characteristics of the scattering molecule has been calculated by Debye, Zimm and others as (Wyatt \"polymer constant\" = (21m2/).. ~A)(dnIdci(1+cos2e) c = the concentration of solution n = the refractive index of solution ).. = the wavelength in vacuo NA = Avogadro's number virial coefficients (A2 is as B in equation Ro= the Rayleigh excess factor = RtAsolution) -RtAsolvent) p{e) = the form factor which depends on shape and size of the scattering molecules -61-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods At limiting conditions where B approaches zero angle, P(B) approaches unity irrespective of size or shape of the scattering species. At low angles and concentrations, equation I can therefore be rewritten as: (2 -22) If A2 is known, Mw can be determined from a single measurement of Ro, which enables the continuous monitoring of SEC eluents. So, from the SEC trace shown, the molecular weight for uniform intervals on the elution curve is calculated from: Kc; / Re,i = w,i + 2A2c; (2 -23) The concentration Cj is most usually calculated from Ci = (mx;)/ V;x; (2\u00b724) For each elution slice (i) in SEC the concentration (Ci) is obtained from a concentration sensitive detector, and Ra is obtained from the MALLS (after extrapolation to zero angle). MW,j is then calculated according to equation (2- 23). A2 must be known from independent light scattering measurements, unless the sample concentration is kept so low that A2c \u00abllMw. With SEC\u00b7 MALLS, this is normally the case, since samples are diluted on the column. 2.2.3.3 Method Acetate buffer, pH 4.3, was pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 mlImin through a column system consisting of TSK-G5000PW, TSK\u00b7G4000PW and TSK\u00b7 G3000PW analytical columns protected by a guard column. Solutions of each chitosan sample were prepared as described in relevant study and 100 ,.u was injected onto the columns at ambient temperature (sample filtered through 0.45 J..UD filter to remove any insoluble material or dust prior to injection). The eluting fractions were monitored using a Dawn DSP, multi-angle light- -62-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods scattering photometer (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, USA) fitted with a 5 mW He-Ne Laser and a differential interoferometric refractometer (Optilab 903, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, USA). Apparent weight average molecular weights were obtained using the Debye plot method on the associated ASTRA Nanoparticles 2.2.4.1 Cbitosan Nanoparticles Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared according to the method described in (Dyer et al. 2002). A solution of a chitosan was prepared at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in distilled water. To this solution tripolyphosphate pentasodium (TPP) solution was added dropwise at the appropriate ratio whilst continuously stirring. This resulted in an opalescent solution. The solution was then divided into aliquots which were used for either determination of yield, loading capacity, or for use in chitosan stability experiments (see Chapter 6). 2.2.4.2 Cbitosan-Insulin Nanoparticles Insulin loaded chitosan nanoparticles are prepared in the same way as above except insulin is predissolved in the TPP solution at a concentration of 1.25 mg/ml. As with the chitosan nanoparticles the resulting nanoparticle suspension is divided into aliquots for determination of yield, etc. and for use in stability experiments. 2.2.5 Estimation of chitosan concentration During the manufacture of chitosan nanoparticles it was necessary to determine the amount of chitosan present in the supernatant after -63-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods centrifugation to allow for calculation of nanoparticle yield. The chitosan content was calculated by means of the ninhydrin reaction. Ninhydrin reacts with primary amino groups to produce a coloured product (diketohydrindylidene-diketodhyrindamine, also known as Ruhemann' s purple). The method used here is based on that used by Prochazkova et al. (1999) and adapted by Leane et al. (2004). 2.2.5.1 Method Lithium acetate buffer (10ml) was prepared by dissolving 4.08g of lithium acetate in approximately 6ml of deionised water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.2 with glacial acetic acid and the volume adjusted to IOml with deionised water. The ninhydrin was freshly prepared on the day of the assay by adding 4M lithium acetate buffer was added to O.5ml of sample in a glass bottle and shaken by hand. This was then heated in boiling water for 30 minutes to allow the reaction to proceed during which time a change in colour to purple is observed. The sample is then cooled and diluted with 15ml50% ethanol and vortexed for 15 seconds to oxidise excess hydrindantin. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 570nm using a UV spectrophotometer and the concentration of chitosan calculated from a standard calibration curve (prepared on day of assay from the same chitosan used in the test sample). 2.2.6 Estimation of insulin concentration The insulin concentrations of the various formulations were analyzed using a Gilson HPLC system fitted with a Vydac Cl8 5 ~ pre-column and a Vydac -64-Chapter 2: Materials and Methods reverse phase C18 5~ 150 x 4.6 mm column (Hichrom, Reading, United Kingdom) (Dyer et a1. 2002). Gradient conditions and a flow rate of 1.0 mllroin ( ambient temperature) were used. The mobile phase was composed of eluent A, containing 95% ethanolamine (0.6%, pH ethanolamine (0.6%, pH 3) and 60% acetonitrile. The injection volume was 10 ,.d. The ultraviolet detector was set at 210 nm. The analysis run time was 18 min. Samples were prepared for analysis by dissolving/diluting the formulation in eluent B. -65-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Chitosan Samples Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chitosan Samples 3.1 Introduction For most applications of chitosan, and especially in the pharmaceutical industry, the molecular weight and degree of acetylation determine the properties and thereby the effectiveness of the chitosan for a particular application. Schipper et al. (1996) reported that for chitosan to enhance the absorption of hydrophilic drugs across mucosal surfaces, a low degree of acetylation and/or high molecular weight appeared to be necessary. In this chapter chitosan samples are characterized under similar aqueous conditions in terms of molecular weight (using sedimentation equilibrium and SEC-MALLS) and their conformation determined using data obtained from sedimentation velocity and intrinsic viscosity measurements. 3.2 Methods 3.2.1 Intrinsic viscosity Intrinsic viscosities were determined using an Ostwald-type viscometer of 2 ml capacity over a concentration range of 0.2 -2.0 mg/ml as described in section 2.2.2.2. The flow times were recorded at (20.00 \u00b1 0.01) \u00b0C. From the solution: solvent flow time ratio the kinematic relative viscosity was obtained. The intrinsic viscosity ([ 1]]) was found by extrapolation to infinite dilution of both reduced viscosity using the Huggins equation and inherent viscosity using the Kraemer equation (see section 2.2.2). -66-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of A Beckman XLI Analytical Ultracentrifuge was used for the determination of sedimentation coefficients at 20\u00b0C and a rotor speed of 45,000 rpm. Sedimentation coefficients were obtained by analysis of the change in concentration distribution in the centrifuge cell with time using the \"time derivative\" algorithm DCDT+ (Philo 2000) and corrected to standard solvent conditions as described in section 2.2.1.2.1. Measurements were made at several concentrations (from 0.3 to 1.0 mglml) and the calculated S20,w values (or reciprocals thereof) were extrapolated to infinite dilution to yield s~o,w' 3.2.3 Sedimentation Equilibrium Low-speed sedimentation equilibrium was used to determine the molecular weights ( weight averages) of the various chitosan samples. Two analytical ultracentrifuges were employed. Firstly, a Beckman XLI Analytical Ultracentrifuge was used for chitosan solutions in the range of concentrations 0.5 -1.0 mglml, at rotor speeds of 14,000 rpm (chitosan G112) or 8,000 rpm (other chitosans) and a temperature of 20.0\u00b0C. The data collected from the Rayleigh interference optical system was analysed using the MST ARI program to give an apparent weight average molecular weight Mw,app (see section 2.2.1.3.1). A low concentration sample (0.3 mglml) was also analysed using a Beckman Model E Analytical Ultracentrifuge (at rotor speeds between 10,000 and 20,000 rpm, and at 20.0\u00b0C) equipped with Schlieren optics (section 2.2.1.1.2). The data was analysed by fitting to the Lamm equation (section 2.2.1.3.2) to yield the .apparent z-average moleculQT weight (Mz,app). The data set was then -67-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chitosan Samples transfonned by integrating with respect to r (distance from the meniscus) and analysed using MST ARI program to obtain Mw,app. 3.2.4 SEC-MALLS The molecular weights (weight averages) of the chitosan samples was determined using SEC-MALLS as described in section 2.2.3. The data obtained was analysed using the Debye plot method to give an apparent weight average molecular weight, Mw,app. 3.3 Materials Chitosan samples were used as provided by Pronova Ltd., Drammen, Norway. Solutions were prepared in O.2M acetate buffer, pH 4.3 at appropriate concentrations for each method.

Table 3-2 shows the intrinsic viscosities obtained from each method along with the corresponding constants. An example of the plots obtained for chitosan G214 using the Huggins and Kraemer equations is shown in Figure 3-1. The intercept of these two plots -68-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chitosan Samples with the y-axis gives the intrinsic viscosity and should be equivalent irrespective of the method used. The non-intersection seen in Figure 3-1 reflects the noise in the data. From the values in Table 3-2, the intrinsic viscosities obtained are very similar using both methods. The manufacturer's data from apparent viscosity of the chitosan samples increases across the table -from left to right (Table 3-1). Comparing these with the intrinsic viscosities in Table 3-2, the same trend is apparent. The intrinsic viscosities obtained for chitosan 0213 and chitosan CL210 are higher and lower, respectively, than would be expected from the manufacturer's data. This may be due to the different methods that have been used to obtain the two sets of data. The apparent viscosity is measured at a single concentration (10 mg/ml) whereas the intrinsic viscosities are determined using several measurements which are extrapolated to infinite dilution. The result of this extrapolation means that the intrinsic viscosity value obtained is not dependent on the chitosan concentration, only on the solvent used. The differences may also be due to aging of the samples, since the samples used had different manufacturing dates and some degradation may have occurred during storage. 3.4.2 Sedimentation Coefficients The sedimentation coefficients calculated for each cbitosan sample are shown in Table 3-3, with an example plot for chitosan 0214 shown in Figure 3-2 .. As for the viscosity data, the sedimentation coefficients also increase in the same trend as seen in the manufacturer's data. The values obtained (in the range 1.6 -3.0) are in good agreement with values obtained by other researchers for various chitosans (for example Rinaudo and Domard 1993; Errington et al. 1993; Berth et al. 1998). As with intrinsic viscosity values, the sedimentation coefficient is dependent on the size of the macromolecule, and an increase in either of these parameter will indicate an increase in the molecular weight of the chitosan. The increasing values of the sedimentation coefficient agree with the molecular weight values that were obtained using sedimentation equilibrium and SEC-MALLS (the molecular weight values are discussed in section 3.4.3.). As discussed in Section 2.2.1.2.2., sedimentation coefficients are dependent on concentration, the measured apparent sedimentation coefficient decreasing with increasing concentration (Wales and Holde 1954). The concentration dependence is due to the increased viscosity of the solution with increasing concentration resulting in a slower sedimentation of the solute particle and hence a larger sedimentation coefficient. This effect can be seen from Figure 3-2 were lIS2o,w increased with increasing concentration. From the plot of lIS20,w vs concentration, the concentration dependence sedimentation coefficient, k\" can be obtained from the slope of the extrapolated trend line (see equation (2-10\u00bb. The values for this coefficient are an indication of the effect that the concentration of the solute has on sedimentation coefficient. From Table 3-3 it can be seen that chitosan CL210 has a very large concentration dependence coefficient, whereas for chitosan G 112 it is quite low. The significant variation in the extent of concentration dependence of the sedimentation coefficient, highlight the importance of standardising the sedimentation extrapolation to infinite dilution after the sedimentation coefficients at each concentration have been converted to standard conditions (water and temperature 20\u00b0C using equation (2-9\u00bb. -70-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chitosan Samples Without this standardization, comparison of sedimentation coefficient for different chitosan or for the same chitosan by different researchers would be pointless.

Absolute methods include analytical ultracentrifugion and light scattering methods and do not require calibration using materials of known molecular weight and identical conformation. The two absolute methods used here are sedimentation equilibrium using the analytical ultracentrifuge and size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering. The two methods are compared based on the data obtained for several chitosan samples, and the practicability discussed. Table 3-4: Molecular weight of chitosan samples determined using direct and Mw obtained (SEC-MALLS) -z-average molecular weight obtained from of Chitosan Samples 3.4.3.1 Ultracentrifugation (.4UC) Measurement of molecular weight using the AUC requires the determination of molecular weight at several concentrations due to thermodynamic non\u00ad ideality. In this study weight average molecular weights were determined at several concentrations using two AUCs. Firstly three concentrations (l.0, 0.8, and 0.5 mg/ml) were run on the XLI AUC and the apparent molecular weight determined from the interference data collected using the MST AR program. For 0.5 mg/ml chitosan solution the effects of non-ideality are still apparent (as indicated by the downwards curvature in the In J versus ~ plot -Figure 3-3) and it is therefore best to also determine the molecular weight from data collected at lower concentrations (molecular weight determined at 0.3 mg/ml using Model E AUC as described in next paragraph). Chitosan is a polydisperse system, and this can normally be seen from upward curvature in the In J versus ~ plot, however, the downward curvature in Figure 3-3 indicates that the effects of polydispersity are overshadowed by thermodynamic non-ideality (Colfen and Harding 1997). Figure 3-4 shows the w~ight-average molecular weight versus ~ (normalized radial displacement function) and from this the apparent weight average. molecular weight can be calculated (M. at cell base is equal to Mw,app). Data at the base of the cell cannot always be observed completely and therefore extrapolation is necessary. In Figure 3-4, the data does not follow a clear downward curvature that levels out towards the base as would be seen with an ideal system. The data observed here is quite irregular due to the non-ideality associated with a chitosan system. -74-Chapter 3: AUC uses 12mm path length centrepieces, which limits the minimum loading concentration. Since polysaccharides generally have refractive index increments in the range of 0.14 -0.16 mlIg, the minimum loading concentration that can be used to obtain a sufficient fringe increment for molecular weight determination is .....Q.5 -0.6 mlIg in a 12 mm path length cell. The Model E AUC on the other hand, can use either 12 mm or 30 mm path length cells. By using a 30 mm cell, the minimum loading concentration is reduced to 0.2 -0.3 mg/ml (Harding 1992; Jtarding 1995). An apparent molecular weight was determined at a loading concentration of 0.3 mg/ml using the Model E AUC. Figure 3-5 shows the schlieren image produced in the Model E AUC (the principles of schIieren optics are described in section 2.2.1.1.2.). Data collected from this image can be plotted using the Lamm equation (example plot shown in Figure 3-6) to give an estimate of Mz,app. and by integration of the data with respect to r (distance from the meniscus), it can be analysed using MST AR to determine Mw,app' The apparent molecular weights can be plotted against concentration using equation (2-12) (section 2.2.1.3.) to determine the true molecular weight for the chitosan. An example plot can be seen in Figure 3-7. As previously mentioned, non-ideality causes the molecular weight for chitosan calculated from AUC data to be lower than the true molecular weight. There are two major contributing factors to this phenomenon: the excluded volume and the polyelectrolyte effect. The excluded volume arises from one molecule excluding another from the space occupied by it. For a sphere the excluded volume is eight times the volume, and the more extended the Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chitosan Samples conformation of the molecule the greater the excluded volume. Another contribution to exclusion volume comes from the swelling of the molecule through \"hydration\" or time-averaged association with water molecules. For a polysaccharide molecule in solution, the swollen volume can be 100 times its volume in the dry state (Harding 1995). The excluded volume can also be affected by interactions between the solute and solvent or by repulsion between solute molecules. The repulsion between solute molecules will be high for chitosan due to the high charge density on the molecule (-90 charges per 100 subunits) when in aqueous acidic solution. The intermolecular repulsion between the charged amino groups on chitosan results in a highly extended conformation. Chitosan will therefore have a large excluded volume and highly non-ideal behaviour when in solution. Increasing the ionic strength of the solution medium, thus reducing the electrostatic repulsion, can reduce the polyelectrolyte effect. However, for chitosan, large increases in ionic strength lead to reduced solubility and salting out can occur. The term 2BM (second virial coefficient x molecular weight) is a measure of the non-ideality associated with the system (Van Holde 1971). For a spherical, uncharged molecule this would have a value of approximately 5-10 ml/g, and the value increases as the system deviates from ideality. From Table 3-4 it can be seen the 2BM values are in the range 1000-2000 ml/g indicating that chitosan is a highly non-ideal macromolecule. At very low solute concentrations, ideal behaviour is approached (Van Holde 1998) and the effects of non-ideality should be small. Measurement at a single finite, but low (0.2 -0.5 mglml) concentration can give an estimate of the apparent molecular weight within a few percent of the true molecular weight. -76-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chitosan Samples However, for chitosan the data obtained on the Model E ADC at a loading concentration of 0.3 mglml still showed non-ideality (deviation of data from trend line shown in Figure 3-6). Thus extrapolation to infinite dilution after measurement of the apparent molecular weight at several concentrations is necessary (see figure 3-7). -77-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chit os Plot oflu Jversus; for chitosau G214 (concentration 0.5 mglml) 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 .., .s 0.7 0.6 0.5 Theoretical data for an idea~stem 0.0 0.2 0.4 Data obtained from AUCXLI 0.6 0.8 1.0 ~ -radial distance from centre of rotation normaUzed so that has a value of 0 at the solution meniscus and a value of 1 at the cell base Figure 3-4: Plot of Mw\u00b7 versus ~ for chitosan G214 (M\u00b7(~ l)=Mw,app) (concentration 0.5 mglml) 0.04 -I--.....--...----.-----r--....--,..--.---r--.....----, 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 -78-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chit os an Samples Figure 3-5: Schlieren image as produced on Model E AUC for chitosan G214 (concentration 0.3 mglml) for Chitosan G214 (concentration 0.3 mglml) 2.0 1.5 1.0 ~ ~ Mw determination of chitosan G214 from sedimentation equilibrium 20 -/ 18 16 g14 ~ 12 '9 ~10 - ~ - 18 i6 '\"\" 4 2 0 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 Cone (mg/ml) Figure 3-8: Light scattering (R90) and Refractive Index (RI) obtained SEC\u00ad MALLS for cbitosan G214 (concentration Smglml; solvent -O.2M acetate buffer, pH 4.3) 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Volume (m I) -80-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chitosan Samples 3.4.3.2 SEC-MALLS SEC-MALLS also allows the direct evaluation of the absolute molecular weight of a macromolecule. However, with SEC-MALLS the measurements take approximately 60 minutes (after appropriate equilibration of the SEC columns) compared to up to 3 days for AUC measurements. Another advantage of SEC-MALLS over AUC is that no correction for non-ideality is required since the sample is diluted in the columns to such an extent that the concentrations of the volume \"slices\" passing through the light scattering detector are much lower than the initial loading concentration. These concentrations are usually 0.1 mg/ml or less (depending on the molecular weight of the scatterer), and corrections of non-ideality are not significant (Wyatt 1993). Figure 3-8 shows an example of the trace produced using SEC-MALLS. The red trace shows the light scattering signal for chitosan, while the blue trace shows the refractive index signal. This is a measurement of the concentration of chitosan as it elutes and by combining the data from the two traces we can calculate the molecular weight distribution for each chitosan sample. From the light scattering traces it can be seen that in each case the peaks from the macromolecular component are skewed and not symmetrical. There was also evidence of trace amounts of high molecular weight aggregates from the 90\u00b0 angle light scattering traces as indicated by the shoulders on the low elution volume or high molecular weight side of the light scattering peaks. However, except for sample 0112 these light scattering signals are not accompanied by corresponding RI (concentration) signals indicating that only negligible amounts \u00ab1%) are present in the samples. No such supramolecular particles -81-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chitosan Samples were observed from the sedimentation velocity g*(s) distributions obtained using time-derivative DCDT + analysis, which showed only a single, approximately symmetrical peak in each case, including Gl12. The molecular weights obtained from both AUC and SEC-MALLS measurements are in reasonable agreement (Table 3-4). Since SEC-MALLS is the more convenient technique, this will be used for measurement of molecular weight in the :furtJ:ler experiments discussed in this thesis, however, for characterisation purposes it is advisable to also determine the molecular weight using the AUC to obtain a reliable and independent verification of the results. 3.4.4 Conformation of Chltosan The conformation of chitosan is dependent upon the degree of acetylation of the molecule and the solvent conditions in which it is studied. The more deacetylated the molecule, the more extended the conformation due to the increase in charged amino groups along the chain. By altering the pH and ionic strength of the solution medium the conformation can be changed. Increases in ionic strength will reduce electrostatic repulsion leading to a more compact conformation, as will increases in pH since less amino groups will be charged. 3.4.4.1 Mark-Houwink Kuhn Sakarada relation The Mark-Houwink can be used as a conformation indicator. The most common form of the MHKS equation relates intrinsic viscosity to molecular weight (Harding 1997): -82-Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic Characterisation of Chitosan Samples where K and a both depend on the polymer conformation. This relation was fIrst suggested by Mark in 1938 and independently by Houwink in 1940. Similar relations exist for other hydrodynamic properties, e.g. sedimentation coefficients. The conformation of a molecule can be estimated depending on the value of these exponents are found in Table 3-5.

A linear fIt to the log s~o,w versus log Mw yielded an MHKS exponent b = (0.25 \u00b1 0.04), i.e. between the limits of rod (0.15) and coil (0.4- 0.5). Similarly a linear fIt to the log [11] versus log Mw yielded an MHKS exponent a = (0.96 \u00b1 0.10), again between the coil (0.5 -0.6) and rod (1.8) limits. However, interpretation of such data should be done with caution because of the clear demonstration by others of a dependence conformation on the degree of acetylation (Anthonsen et al. 1993; Berth and Dautzenberg 2002). Despite this reservation, the values obtained appear similar to those for three chitosans with degrees of acetylation in the range 22-31 % (Colfen et al. 2001): a ~ 1 and b ~ 0.24. Furthermore, the data reassuringly shows consistency between the sedimentation coefficient and viscosity data. -83-Chapter Double logarithmic plot of sedimentation coefficient versus weight average molecular weight (SEC-MALLS) for chitosan samples (glutamate salts ... ~ 0.30 0.25 0.20 5.0 5.2 6.4 5.6 log1OMw Figure 3.10: Double logarithmic plot of intrinsic viscosity versus weight average molecular weight (SEC-MALLS values) of chitosan samples (glutamate salts only) 2J3 _ 2.4 .E6 ... 2.2 .8' 2.0 1.8 1.6 1.4 4.5 -84-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan 4.1 Introduction In this chapter the effect of various solvent parameters on chitosan degradation will be examined. It is known that the pH and ionic strength of a solvent affects the confonnation of chitosan and these effects on confonnation will be discussed in tenns of the effects on degradation. Other conditions examined in this chapter are storage temperature; concentration of chitosan and the addition of scavenging agents which can be used to reduce oxidative reductive degradation (see section 1.2.2.2.). In the fIrst section of this chapter, the effect of individual parameters (pH, temperature, ionic strength, presence of scavenging agent) will be studied. In the second section, the effect of several factors is studied in a multi-factorial experiment. 4.2 Effect of Individual Factors on Chitosan Degradation 4.2.1 Materials and Methods Degradation of chitosan was followed using both viscosity measurements and sedimentation data. 1.0 mg/ml chitosan solutions (Chitosan CL210) were prepared in either 0.2 M HCI (PH 1.28) or O.lM acetate buffer at specifIed pH (PH 4 or 5) and ionic strength (I = 0.2 or O.3M). Each sample was then stored in closed glass bottles (clear) at the appropriate temperature (4, 25, 40\u00b0C) and sampled weekly. Samples were prepared in triplicate. In the study on the effect of scavenging agents, 7mM thiourea was added to the chitosan solution. -85-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan 4.2.1.1 Viscosity data Sample and solvent flow times were measured at 25\u00b0C using a 2 ml Ostwald viscometer. The reduced viscosity calculated using equation (2-16). When viscosity vs time was plotted as a scatter graph, it could be seen that the decay or loss of viscosity followed first order kinetics. In first order degradation the rate of decay of a substance is proportional to the first power of the concentration of that substance, and independent of any other substance present. By fitting each data set to a first order degradation curve (equation 4-1), a rate constant (k) can be obtained: (4 -1) where \"red is the reduced viscosity measured at time t, and TJresid is the residual viscosity after the period of study. 4.2.1.2 Sedimentation data Sedimentation coefficients were determined from sedimentation velocity data (see section 2.2.1.2.) and converted to standard conditions using equation (2- 9). Molecular weights (Mw,app) were determined from equilibrium data at concentration of Imglml, 0.8mglml and O.5mglml. This data was analysed using MSTAR and extrapolated to zero concentration to give Mw (glmol). 4.2.1.3 Degradation rate Degradation rates were determined using a method described in Varum et al. (2001). Solutions of chitosan (CL21 0 -DA 18%) were prepared in a range of acid solutions (0.01 -0.4 M HCI) at a concentration of 0.5 mglml. Each sample was stirred for one hour to ensure dissolution of the chitosan. 2 ml of -86-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan the sample was transferred to an Ostwald capillary viscometer suspended in a thermostatically controlled water bath at (60.0 \u00b1 O.5\u00b0C) and allowed to equilibrate to temperature for 20 minutes before commencing flow time measurements. Flow times were recorded at 10-minute intervals over one hour. From the flow times, the degree of polymerisation was calculated (Nordtveit et al. 1994) using Mark-Houwink coefficients; a :::; 0.78, K = 5.58xlO-2 (Anthonsen et al. 1993). Rate constants were calculated by plotting the degree of scission (a=IIDP n) versus time, the value of the slope being equal to the reaction rate. Samples were measured in triplicate. -87-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan 4.2.2 Results 4.2.2.1 Effects of Temperature Figure 4-1 shows the effect of temperature on the reduced viscosity of chitosan samples. Each sample had approximately the same initial viscosity, which decreased over the eight-week period. The rate of degradation was fastest at 40\u00b0C (Rate = 0.775 week-I), with a decrease in viscosity of 55% over the 8 week period, and slowest at 4\u00b0C (Rate = 0.087 week-\\ with a decrease in viscosity of 15%. This suggests that chitosan has greater stability at lower temperatures. This result was in agreement with Jia and Shen (2002) who showed that the intrinsic viscosity of chitosan decreased from 320 to 70 ml/g after only 8h storage at 40\u00b0C, while at ambient temperature the intrinsic viscosity remained at -120ml/g after 35 days storages (solvent : 85% phosphoric acid). The rate constants of most reactions increase as the temperature is raised. Typically, the degradation of chitosan requires the cleavage of bonds along the chitosan chain (usually the glycosidic bond joining the two glucosamine residues). The breaking of chemical bonds requires energy, i.e. it is an endothermic process. Therefore, as shown here, the rate of degradation will increase as the temperature increases since more energy is available. -88-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 4-1: Effect of temperature on reduced viscosity of chitosan solution (ImglmJ CL210; pH \u00a3500 ~450 ~ ~400 350 300 .. 250 0 2 4 6 8 Time (weeks) Table 4-1: Degradation rates for cbitosan solutions at 40\u00b0C 0.775 -89-Chapter 4: Effect Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan 4.2.2.2 Effect of Ionic Strength Figure 4-2 shows the effect of solution ionic strength on chitosan viscosity and degradation. In contrast to the results shown in Figure 4-1 the initial viscosities of the samples decreased as the ionic strength increased. This can probably be attributed to chitosan being a polyelectrolyte: the hydrodynamic behaviour of chitosan is affected by changes in the degree of protonation in different ionic strength and/or pH solutions. However, there is still much debate as to whether varying the degree of acetylation of chitosan affects the expansion and stiffuess of the chains in solution (Ott0)' et al. 1996; Berth et al. 1998). On one hand, a higher content of bulky acetyl groups may increase the stiffuess of the chains for steric reasons. This effect was demonstrated by the Trondheim group, who found that chitosan exhibited higher expansion and stiffuess with increasing DA (Anthonsen et al. 1993; Anthonsen et al. 1994; 0tt0)' et al. ,1996). On the other hand, a lower DA means a higher amount of amino grpups, which are charged in aqueous acidic solution. As described in Tanford (1961) for flexible polymer chains, the accumulation of charge leads to considerable expansion due to electrostatic repulsion. Errington et al. (1993) found that chitosans with a higher DA appeared to exhibit a less extended conformation due to a decrease in electrostatic charge on the molecule. In low ionic strength solutions, the charge effects dominate, which makes the chitosan molecule exist in an extended conformation due to electrostatic repulsion. However, in high ionic strength solutions, the concentration of the counter-ions are raised which screens the protonated amide groups and makes the molecule more contracted (Tanford 1961; Tsaih and Chen 1997). This change of the chitosan molecule with increasing ionic -90-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan strength will cause the solution viscosity to decrease as demonstrated in Figure 4-2. Figure 4-2 also shows that over the eight-week period, the rate of degradation over ionic strength range 0.1 -O.3M was approximately the same. This indicates that the changes in chitosan conformation over this ionic strength range have little effect on its stability in aqueous solution. -91-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 4-2: Effect of Ionic strength on reduced viscosity of chitosan 650 -600 Q> I 550 1500 I=\" 450 400 350 0 246 8 Time (weeks) Table 4-2: Degradation rates for chitosan solutions at 4: Effect Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan 4.2.2.3 Effect of pH The main mechanism of degradation of chitosan in aqueous solution is believed to be acid degradation (V8.rum et al. 2001); therefore it would be expected to observe increased degradation in more acidic conditions, Le. low pH. Figure 4-3 shows the decrease in viscosity over an eight week period in chitosan solutions of different pHs. The initial viscosities at each pH are similar, indicating that in the pH range studied there was little change in chitosan conformation. It was also observed that the rate of chitosan degradation, as indicated by decrease in viscosity, increased as the pH of the chitosan solution increased (Table 4-3). This would suggest that chitosan is more stable in acidic conditions. In contrast, V8.rum et al. (2001) showed for a chitosan of different DA (DA = 62%) that as the pH of solution decreased, degradation increased, i.e. chitosan was susceptible to acid degradation. An estimation of sedimentation coefficients can give a further indication of stability of chitosan stored at different pHs. Figure 4-4 and Figure 4-5 show the apparent sedimentation coefficient distributions for each sample. The peak maximum gives S20,w and the peak width gives an indication of the relative polydispersity of the sample (complications through particle diffusion obscure interpretation of absolute polydispersity). The area' under the curve can be used to calculate the concentration of the species, however, it should be noted that this concentration does not include small fractions that may not have sedimented from the meniscus or large, aggregated fractions that will have rapidly sedimented to the base. Figure 4-4 shows the sedimentation coefficients of chitosan stored at pH 1.28. A significant decrease, as -93-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan expressed in Svedbergs, was observed in the first month, with minimal change in the second month. This decrease in sedimentation coefficient would appear to indicate that the chitosan has degraded by approximately 27% in the first month, with a much-reduced degradation (~2%) in the second month. These results are further supported by the weight-average molecular weights determined using sedimentation equilibrium (Table 4-4). For the chitosan solution stored at pH 5, a steady, progressive decrease in the sedimentation coefficients and narrowing of the peak was observed over the two month period (Figure 4-5), resulting in a decrease of approximately 35%, ~.e. greater than for the chitosan stored at pH 1.28. Degradation occurred at a faster rate at a lower pH, Le. in more acidic conditions, which is in agreement with Varum et al. (2001), however after two months the extent of degradation in both cases was comparable. -94-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 4-3: Effect of pH on reduced 600 Cl ::::::500 .s 1400 I=\" 300 200 0 2 4 6 8 Time (weeks) Table 4-3: Degradation rates for cbitosan solutions at different pHs % Decrease in Viscosity k (week-I) 0-8wks 24 22 pH5.5 0.442 64 39 24 -95-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 4-4: Distribution of apparent HCI (PH 1.28) at various time points (0=::3) 3.0 2.5 ~ .8 2.0 ~ ~ 1.5 Cl c J: ::::: 1.0 -2month 0.0 +-~-'-\"\"\"\"'T--.--.--.--.--.- -;O--.--.----.----r=::!!POO..,..-.--.-...., 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.5 4.5 S*20.W (Svedberg) Table 4-4: Sedimentation coefficients (from analysis) average weight (from sedimentation equilibrium) for cbitosan (ImglmJ) O.2MHCI 0.01 120,000 2 months l.63 \u00b1 0.01 121,000 -96-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 4-5: Distribution of apparent sedimentation coefficients for chitosan (lmgfml) in O.lM Acetate buffer, pH at vanoos time points, (n=3) 7 6 --start --1 month -2 months o+-~~~~~-r~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~ 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 s\u00b7 2O.w (Svedberg) (lmgfmJ) in O.lM Acetate buffer, pH 5 Time s*zo,.,..

After this period, degradation occurred at a similar rate, irrespective of the pH of solution. Again, a possible explanation for this may be a change in the conformation of chitosan. The initial viscosity reading for each sample was taken one hour after dissolution. During the subsequent two weeks degradation can occur at two possible sites; the glycosidic bonds linking the glucosamine residues or cleavage of the acetyl group on C4. Breaking of the glycosidic bonds would result in a decrease in viscosity since the length of the chitosan chain would decrease. However, cleavage of the acetyl groups would results in more amide groups on the chitosan chain. In acidic solutions these amide groups are protonated, which might result in a more extended conformation and therefore an increase in viscosity. At low pH there are more hydrogen ions present which increases the chances of acetyl groups being cleaved from the chitosan chain as well as cleavage of the glycosidic bonds. Any increase in viscosity due to changes in conformation could mask the decrease in viscosity due to degradation of the chitosan chain, making it appear that chitosan degrades fastest in a high pH solution. To confirm that acid hydrolysis does occur, the experiment reported by Varum et al. (2001) was repea,ted. This experiment was carried out at 'two chitosan concentrations and the results can be seen in Figure 4-6. The rate of . degradation increased as the acid concentration increased, which agrees with the. data for a chitosan of higher DA studied by Varum et al. (2001). Interestingly, the initial concentration of chitosan had an effect on the -98-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan degradation rate. Degradation appeared to occur faster at higher chitosan concentrations and this is probably due to the increased number of glycosidic bonds available for cleavage. Comparing Varum's results for a chitosan of DA=62% with the present data (DA::::::18%) obtained at the same concentration and using the same experimental conditions (Figure 4-7), there was a significant difference in the degradation rates (10 fold difference). This difference can be explained by the structural difference in the chitosans used in the two experiments (degree of acetylation), and is considered further in the Chapter 5. -99-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 4-6: Degradation rate constants as a function of acid concentration (HCI), determined by the mg/ml I 0.0 -f.:....---...----,---,--r---.---r--~-..______. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Acid Concentration (M) Figure 4-7: Degradation rate constants as a function of acid concentration (HCI), determined by the viscosity assay at 60\u00b0C.

ORD involves a series of free radical reactions that ultimately lead to chain scission. Figure 4-8 to Figure 4-10 show the degradation of chitosan under different acidic solutions, in the presence of various scavenging agents, measured by changes in the reduced viscosity of the chitosan solution. As seen in Figure 4-3, as the pH of the solution increased, the rate of degradation increased, and this effect also occurred in the presence of scavenging agents (Figures 4-8 to 4-10). This may be explained by changes in chitosan conformation (see section 1.2.1.3.). At pH 1.28 and pH 5.5 (Figure 4-8 and Figure 4-10) the effect of scavenger on degradation was seen to be minimal. By contrast, at pH 4 (Figure 4-9), the presence of scavenger in the solution increased the stability of chitosan by approximately 18% (based on reduced viscosity after 8 weeks), which is not considered significant. Figure 4-4 and Figure 4-11 show the degradation of chitosan at pH 1.28, with or without thiourea. In the absence of thiourea it can be seen that the sedimentation coefficient,s~ow' decreased rapidly over the first month with , minimal degradation in the second. Whereas, when thiourea was present (Figure 4-11) minimal degradation occurred over the one-month period. This would indicate that thiourea increased the solution stability of chitosan. However, comparing the initial distribution curves (time = 0) for each sample, . there was a marked difference. In the absence of thiourea the curve was very broad and flat, whereas with thiourea present, it was narrower and taller. It would have been expected that at the'start of each study, the sedimentation -101-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan coefficients for the two samples would have been similar and have a similar distribution. The differences in the initial distributions may be due to the presence of thiourea. The molecular weight detennined (using sedimentation equilibrium) at each time point (Table 4-4; pH 1.28) are in good agreement with the change in sedimentation coefficients for those samples not containing thiourea. However in the presence of thiourea, the initial calculated molecular weight was higher than expected (Table 4-6; pH 1.28). Again this may be due to some effect of thiourea on the confonnation of chitosan. Figure 4-5 and Figure 4-12 show the degradation of chitosan at pH 5, with or without thiourea. The results obtained are similar to those at pH 1.28 and again suggest that thiourea has had some effect on chitosan, possibly a confonnation effect. By studying the change in reduced viscosity at 60\u00b0C (Figure 4-13), the results indicate that as acid concentration increased the rate of degradation increased, which is suggestive of acid hydrolysis. However, the presence of thiourea does not have a significant effect (to.05,3df = 3.182; t = 1,23 therefore not significant) on the degradation rate (Table 4.8). In conclusion, .acid hydrolysis does appear to be the main mechanism by which degradation of chitosan occurs. There may be Some oxfdative reductive degradation due to free .radicals but this appears to be negligible. -102-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 4-8: Viscosity results for chitosan solutions in 0.2M n=3) 700 1100 Time (weeks) Figure 4-9: Viscosity results for chitosan solutions at pH 4 (n=3) 70. 60 ...

In this ... study four factors are looked at using a two level factorial design. 4.3.1 Materials and Methods Degradation of chitosan was followed using viscosity measurements. Chitosan solutions were prepared in triplicate according to the details given in Table 4~9. Each sample was dissolved in O.1M acetate buffer at the specified pH and ionic strength and contained 0.15 mg/ml benzalkonium chloride as a preservative to prevent bacterial growth. Each sample was stored in closed glass bottles (clear) at the appropriate temperature (25 or 40\u00b0C) and sampled at two week intervals. 4.3.1.1 Viscosity data Sample and solvent flow times were measured at 25\u00b0C using a 2 ml Ostwald viscometer. The reduced viscosity calculated using equation (2-16). At set time points of 2 weeks, Imonth, 2 months and 3 months, a sample of each formulation was examined using viscosity as an indication of the degree of degradation (~s described in section 2.2.2.3.). 4.3.1.2 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis of the viscosity data collected over the study period was carried out using a computer software package: Design Expert (Stat-Ease, Inc . . 2000).

These were: pH, chitosan concentration and time. As was indicated in section 4.3.2., the ionic strength of the solution did not have a significant effect on degradation rate, and the presence of a scavenging agent did not improve stability. The ANOVA analysis of the data obtained in this study also showed that ionic strength and presence of a scavenging agent did not have a significant effect on chitosan stability in solution (P = 0.10 and P = 0.13 respectively). For the other factors studied (pH, chitosan concentration, time), the ANOVA results showed a significant effect (Time: P = 0.01; pH: P = 0.05; chitosan concentration: P = 0.04). Model graphs produced using the Design Expert software (Figure 4-14) show the effect of each significant factor on solution viscosity. From the graph for pH it can be seen that there was slightly increased stability at a low pH, but the difference was not high over the pH range studied here. In conclusion, acid hydrolysis of chitosan does occur, however, over the pH range which is acceptable for nasal formulations there was little difference in the observed degradation rates. -109-Chapter 4: Effect of Solvent Characteristics or Solvent Parameters on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 4-14: Model plots showing the effect of each factor on cbitosan stability in a multi-factorial design 100. f 75.0 -110-Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chi to san Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chitosan 5.1 Introduction The structural properties of chitosan have an effect on its conformation and also on its functional applications. The lower the degree of acetylation of chitosan the more extended its conformation in solution which may make it more susceptible to acid degradation and attack from free radical species. However, it has also been stated that the charged amine groups can protect the subsequent glycosidic oxygen against protonation, which is the first stage in acid hydrolysis (Roberts 1992). Schipper et al. (1996/9) looked at the influence of molecular weight and degree of acetylation on chitosan's ability to function as an absorption enhancer. Chitosans with a low degree of acetylation (1 and 15%) were active as absorption enhancers at low and high molecular weights. However, these chitosans displayed a clear dose-dependent toxicity. Chitosans with degrees of acetylation of 35 and 49% have been shown to enhance transport of 14C_ mannitol and with low toxicity, but only if a high molecular weight material is used. So it is possible to select chitosans with maximal effect on absorption and minimal toxicity. In this chapter the effect of degree of acetylation and molecular weight on degradation are investi8,Rted and its attempted to relate this to the selection of the most appropriate chitosan for nasal delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides. -1l1-Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chit os an 5.2 Effect of molecular weight and degree of acetylation on degradation 5.2.1 Materials and Methods The degradation of five chitosan samples (Table 5-1) was investigated over a one-month period. Samples were prepared in triplicate at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in O.2M acetate buffer, pH 4.3, and stored at ambient temperature in clear glass, closed containers. Table S-l:Physical characteristics for 30 7 4 17 20 Acetylation (%) * Average molecular weight determmed usmg SEC-MALLS ID 0.2 M acetate buffer, pH 4.3 Degradation of the chitosan samples was monitored using viscometry and SEC-MALLS. Reduced viscosities were determined for each sample (temperature 20.0\u00b0C) at one week intervals using equation (2-16), Chapter 2. Changes in reduced viscosity were used as an indication of degradation as described in section 2.2.2.3., Chapter 2. At two week intervals, the molecular weight of each chitosan sample was determined by SEC-MALLS using the method described in section 2.2.3.3., Chapter 2. 5.2.2 Results and Discussion Table 5-2 and Table 5-3 show the reduced viscosities and the molecular weights for the chitosan samples over the one month period. The decrease in both reduced viscosity and molecular weight is also indicated as a percentage of the initial viscosity or molecular weight. Comparing the percentage decrease for the two parameters, it can be seen that reduced viscosity -112-Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chi to san measurements are a good indication of degradation since for all the chitosans except chitosan G 112, the percentage decrease is in very good agreement. For chitosan G 112, the percentage decrease at two weeks is in good agreement but at four weeks the percentage results are 74% for the reduced viscosity and 40% for the molecular weight. The reduced viscosity was determined at one week intervals and based on the decrease observed over the first three weeks, a percentage viscosity of 74% at four weeks seems reasonable. This suggests that the molecular weight determined using SEC-MALLS is incorrect. This may be due to the low molecular weight of this chitosan and the column system used may not have produced enough separation for accurate measurement of the molecular weight below 30000kDa. Figure 5-1 shows the decrease in reduced viscosity of the chitosan samples over the one-month storage period in order of decreasing degree of acetylation and increasing molecular weight. With the exception of chitosan G112, the rate of degradation decreases with decreasing degree of acetylation. As the degree of acetylation decreases, the number of charged amino groups present on the chitosan chain will increase. As stated by Roberts (1992), the charged amino group is believed to protect the subsequent glycosidic oxygen against protonation, the. first stage in acid hydrolysis. This theory is supported by the results obtained here. Chitosan G 112 showed less d~on than the other samples, despite having the highest degree of acetylation. This may be due to the low starting molecular weight of this chitosan sample, and hence shorter chain length. V8rum et al. (2001) also examined the effect of degree of acetylation of degradation, and found that as the degree of acetylation decreased, the rate of degradation decreased (see Figure 5-2). -113-Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chi to san The effect of molecular weight on degradation was not as apparent as that of the degree of acetylation. No trend in the extent of degradation was observed with increasing molecular weight. Molecular weight may play a role in the extent of degradation but the range of molecular weights studied here may be too narrow for any trend to be observed. The results observed here would suggest that the main structural factor affecting degradation is the degree of acetylation. -114-Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chitosan Table 5-2: Reduced viscosity values (ml/g) for chitosan samples stored over a one-month period and as a percentage of the initial viscosity Cbitossn \u00bban 0 9 14 21 28 G1l2 142 124 I 88% 124 I determined for cbitosan samples stored over one-month Structural Factors on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 5-1: Change in viscosity of chitosan samples over one month period o Time (days) o Time (days) 100 80 60 40 G213 G213\u00b7 G214 G112 _----- ..... % initial initial reduced viscosity Increasing molecular weight -116-Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 5-2: Degradation rate constant as a function of DA of the chitosan, determined by the viscosity assay at a chitosan concentration 1.Smgfml in O.4M 40 60 80 100 Degree of Acetylation (%) -117-Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chi to san 5.3 Comparison of degradation of two chitosans differing in degree of acetylation 5.3.1 Materials and Methods In this study the aim was to investigate the effect of degree of acetylation on degradation over a range of pH. Two chitosans were chosen; these were chitosan 0213* and chitosan 0214. chitosans have similar molecular weights, 207,500 Da and 172,000 Da but different degree of acetylation, 20% and 4%, respectively. Solutions of each chitosan were prepared in either 0.2M HCI (PH 1.28) or O.1M acetate buffer (PH 4 or 5.5) at a concentration of 1 mglml and stored in clear glass, closed containers at ambient temperature. The degradation was monitored by measuring the reduced viscosity of each solution over a one-month period (see section 2.2.2.3., Chapter 2 for details). 5.3.2 Results and Discussion From Figure 5-3 it can be seen that chitosan 0214 appeared to degrade at a slower rate than chitosan 0213* over the one month storage period. Chitosan 0214 has a lower degree of acetylation, which could account for the slower degradation. As previously stated, the lower the degree of acetylation, the slower the degradation due to the charged amino groups protecting the glycosidic oxygens from protonation (Roberts 1992). The effect of pH on chitosan degradation was also investigated. Both chitosans showed increased degradation with increasing pH (Table 5-4). The same result was observed in section 4.3.3. As discussed in section 4.3.3, the apparent increased stability of chitosan at low pH may be due to changes in its conformation. During degradation, deacetylation may also occur, which could lead to a more extended conformation masking the decrease in viscosity caused by chain scission. -118-Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chitosan Figure 5-3: Degradation of cbitosans G214 and G213* stored in various pH solutions over an 8-week period 100~------------------------------------------~ ~ 90 \"in 0 CJ In \"> pH4 _pH Chitosan G214 -dashed line -119-Chapter 5: Effect of Structural Factors on Degradation of Chi to san Table 5-4: Reduced viscosity values for chitosans G214 and G213* solutions stored at various pHs over an 8-week period Chitosan Days pH 0 16 44 57 Preparation 6.1 Introduction The absorption enhancement abilities of chitosan are in part due to ionic interaction with sialic acid residues in mucus. By using nanopartic1es to deliver a therapeutic protein, it is thought that the interaction between the protein and the nasal mucosa would be intensified (Fel'lUindez-Urrusuno et al. 1999). Also, a high concentration of the protein can be achieved at the site of absorption leading to increased absorption. Chitosan nanoparticles are formed 1999). lonotropic gelation is a very mild process and occurs when the positively charged amino groups on chitosan interact with the negatively charged tripolyphosphate ions. Tripolyphosphoric acid is a weak. polyprotic acid-like acid. When TPP is dissolved in water into both hydroxyl anions to chitosan was found to be much simpler and milder (Shu and Zhu 2002). It was found that polyphosphate only bound on the surface of chitosan droplets, while TPP could diffuse into the chitosan droplets or films freely to form ionically cross-linked beads or films. Chitosan nanoparticles prepared using this method show an excellent capacity for association with proteins such as BSA, tetanus toxoid or insulin. The mechanism of association of proteins to chitosan nanoparticles is mediated by the ionic interaction between both macromolecules. For example, insulin when dissolved in NaOH is negatively charged (PI 5.3), and electrostatic -121-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation interaction with the positively charged amino groups on chitosan is favoured. This mechanism was also supported by the observed partial neutralisation of the nanoparticle surface charge with increasing association with insulin (Femandez-Urrusuno et al. 1999; Janes et al. 2001). Although proteins of positive charge can form complexes with chitosan, other mechanism are involved in their association with chitosan nanoparticles. These include hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, other physicochemical forces dependent upon the specific nature of the associated protein and physical entrapment caused by gelation of chitosan with TPP in nanoparticulate form. These mechanisms enable significant amounts of insulin (15-30%) to be associated with the chitosan nanoparticles even at a pH where insulin is predominantly positively charged (Janes et al. 2001). In this chapter, the yield of nanoparticles is studied using various methods and the effect of chitosan properties on yield are also examined. 6.2 Methods 6.2.1 Preparation of Nanoparticles Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using chitosan CL210 as described in section 2.2.4.1., Chapter 2. The ratio of chitosan to tripolyphosphate pentasoidum (TPP) was 6:1, as used by Dyer et al. (2002). 6.2.2 Estimation of yield and loading of chitosan nanoparticles As with any manufacturing or production process it is important to determine . the yield of the final product so that the efficiency of the process can be evaluated. The most commonly used method for the estimation of nanoparticle yield is to determine the . dry weight of the nanoparticles. An -122-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation alternative method is to determine the concentration of chitosan in the supernatant layer using the ninhydrin assay. The details of these methods are described below. 6.2.2.1 Dry Weight rleld Triplicate samples of nanoparticle suspension (1Oml each) were transferred to pre-weighed glass tubes and centrifuged at approximately 3660 rpm for 30 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the remaining pellet placed in an oven at 100\u00b0C until a constant weight was reached. The theoretical weight of the nanoparticle was based solely on the weight of chitosan and TPP added to the nanoparticle mixture. For nanoparticles prepared at a 6:1 ratio (chitosan:TPP) the theoretical yield was 16.69mg. Yield(%) = Weight dry nanoparticle xl 00 Theoretical Yield (6 -1) For insulin loaded nanoparticles it is important to determine how much insulin is encapsulated. The amount of insulin present in the supernatant was determined using HPLC (as described in section 2.2.7) and from this the Loading Efficiency (LE) and Association Efficiency (AB) can be calculated. Total Insulin -Amt Insulin in Supernatant 100 LE = . . x (6-2) Dry weIght of nanoparticles = Total Insulin -Amt Insulin in Supernatant xl Preparation of Chitosan in supernatant The amount of chitosan present in the supernatant layer after centrifuging of the nanoparticle suspension can be determined using the ninhydrin assay (see section 2.2.5., Chapter 2). This assay is based on the reaction of ninhydrin with a primary amino group such as found on chitosan. The reaction results in a coloured product, diketohydrindylidene-diketohydrindarnine (Ruhemann' s purple), which has a A.max at 570 nm. By preparing a standard calibration curve from solutions of known chitosan concentration, it is possible to determine the amount of chitosan present in the supernatant. Yield (%) = Total Chitosan ~ ~t ~~itosan xl 00 (6 _ o tosan 6.2.2.3 Estimation of Insulin Loading using AUC The loading efficiency and association efficiency of nanoparticles can be calculated by measuring the insulin in solution using HPLC, and substituting this value into equations (6-2) and (6-3), respectively. An alternative method is to run a sedimentation velocity type experiment on the analytical ultracentrifuge using absorption optics. The theory behind this is that by using UV optics, the movement of insulin, both encapsulated and in solution can be ,observed down the cell since chitosan will be invisible. For UV optics, the material being studied has to possess a chromophore to absorb the UV light. Insulin, like most proteins possesses a chromophore and a full UV scan showed that A.max was at 28Onm. Since chitosan does not possess a , chromophore it will not absorb light in the UV region and should be invisible on the scans recorded. -124-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation Sedimentation velocity experiments were run at 2000 rpm and 45000 rpm for both chitosan and insulin-loaded nanoparticles. The results are discussed in the next section. 6.3 Results 6.3.1 Comparison of yields from dry weight and ninhydrin assay The results from both methods of determining nanoparticles yield were compared in order to determine the validity of each method. These results are shown in Table 6-1. Table 6-1: Yields for cbitosan nanoparticles assay 29\u00b1 1 - From comparison of the results obtained using insulin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles it would appear both methods produce similar results. This was confirmed by T -test that showed the two sample groups were not significantly different (to.05,3df= 3.182, t = 1.22). For the estimation of yield using the ninhydrin assay the most important step in the method is the centrifugation of the nanoparticle suspension to separate the nanoparticles from the supematant layer. If the centrifugation speed and duration is not sufficient to cause all the nanoparticles to sediment to the bottom of the sample tube, underestimation of yield could occur. To verify that the chosen speed and duration of centrifugation was sufficient to cause complete sedimentation of nanoparticles present, a second centrifugation step -125-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation was included and the supematant after both step analysed using the ninhydrin assay. The chitosan concentration detennined after each step was the same indicating that a speed of 3660 rpm and duration of 90 minutes is adequate to cause complete sedimentation of the nanoparticles. Inclusion of insulin in the nanoparticles appears to result in increased yield. This could be due to interaction occurring between insulin and chltosan as well as between chltosan and TPP. However, the magnitude of this enhanced yield should be treated with caution, as the amount of insulin incorporated in the nanoparticles was not included in the calculation of yield. 6.3.2 Loading of nanoparticles estimated using AUC 6.3.2~1 Insulin Ntlnoptlrticles Figure 6-1 shows a theoretical representation of the sedimentation of the nanoparticles during a sedimentation velocity experiment at 2000 rpm and 45000 rpm. At 2000 rpm, insulin incorporated in the chltosan nanoparticles should begin to sediment (Case A), whereas insulin that is free in solution should not (Case B). This is due to the difference in the molecular weight of the nanoparticles and insulin. Case C shows the theoretical sedimentation profile when insulin is partially incorporated in the chltosan nanoparticle. Sedimentation of the insulin incorporated in the nanoparticles will occur but the baseline remains high due to the free insulin in solution, which does not sediment at 2000 rpm .. At 45000 rpm (case D), insulin in solution should in theory begin to sediment, although due to the low molecular weight (6000 Da), complete sedimentation to the cell base will most likely not occur. -126-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation Figure 6-1: Diagrammatic loaded chitosan nanopartieles Case A: Insulin fully incorporated -2000 rpm o r (distance from top of cell) Case B: Insulin NOT incorporated (NB assuming chitosan nanopartieles do not r -127-Chapter 6: C: Insulin partially incorporated -2000 rpm A280 o r Case D: Insulin NOT incorporated -45000 rpm A280 r -128-Chapter -insulin nanoparticles Figure 6.2 shows the actual sedimentation profile for insulin (1.5 mglml) at high and low centrifugation speeds. At 2000 rpm, no movement of insulin down the centrifuge cell was observed. This is due to the low molecular weight of insulin (MW -6000Da). At 45000 rpm insulin began to redistribute. As previously mentioned, since free insulin does not show significant redistribution at 2000 rpm, sedimentation observed at this speed should be due to insulin incorporated in the chitosan nanoparticles. Figure 6-3 shows the sedimentation of insulin loaded chitosan nanoparticles. At 2000 rpm sedimentation can be seen occurring over the three-hour period studied. This is likely to be due to the insulin encapsulated in the chitosan nanoparticles since chitosan should not absorb or scatter DV light at 28Onm. Comparison of Figure 6-3 (a and b) reveals a residual absorbance at the meniscus after the nanoparticles have begun to sediment to the base of the cell at 2000 rpm. This shows that some of the insulin has remained free in solution. By determining the v~ue of this residual absorbance, the quantity of insulin that has been encapsulated in the chitosan nanoparticle can be estimated. A control experiment was carried out of chitosan only nanoparticles to show that chitosan does not absorb or scatter DV light at 280 nm.' The scans , obtained at 2000 rpm and 45000 rpm are shown in Figure 6-4. It was hoped that these scans would show, no absorbance, however the data obtained was very.similar to that in 6-3 for the insulin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles. -129-Chapter 6: to the density of the chitosan nanoparticles, they cause scattering of UV light which is picked up by the XLA AVC. Comparing Figure 6-3(a) and Figure 64(a), a difference in the level of absorbance can be seen (approximately 2.2 A and 1.4 A respectively). The difference in absorbance between the two nanoparticle solutions would be due to the insulin incorporated in the nanoparticles in Figure 6-3 (a), however, since chitosan nanoparticles cause scattering of light, this may mask some of the absorbance from insulin so a quantitative measure of the insulin incorporated in the nanoparticles cannot be obtained. In Figure 64(a), no residual absorbance was observed at the meniscus after the nanoparticles began to sediment, reinforcing that the residual absorbance observed in Figure 6-3(a) was due to free insulin in solution. -130-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation Figure 6-2: Sedimentation profiles of Insulin mglml) (a) 2000 rpm 3.0 -----~ ------~------;------ ~------i------i ------i------ ~ ------~------:-------;-------;-----+-----i----- : : : : : : : : : : !

Figure 6-5 shows the sedimentation profiles for myoglobin loaded chitosan nanoparticles and chitosan only nanoparticles at 2000 rpm. The profiles obtained are the same in both the presence and absence of myoglobin. This shows that firstly chitosan nanoparticles still scatter light at 410 nm, and secondly that myoglobin does not appear to be incorporated in the nanoparticles since there is no difference in the level of absorbance between the two formulations. To confirm that myoglobin was not incorporated in the nanoparticles, the concentration of myoglobin in the supernatant after centrifugation was measured using DV spectrophotometry. The result revealed that the entire initial amount of myoglobin added was found in the supematant after nanoparticle formation. There may be some error in this result due to fragments of nanoparticIes that were not removed by filtration. Both insulin and myoglobin has similar isoelectric points (PI = 5.3 and 5.5 respectively) so both will be negatively charged during the formation of chitosan nanoparticles, and thus have the potential to form electrostatic bonds with the -134-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation amine groups on chitosan. The main difference between the two proteins is their molecular weight (6000 Da and 11000 Da for insulin and myoglobin respectively). Since the molecular weight of myoglobin is almost three times that of insulin this may affect its ability to penetrate within the chitosan network before the nanoparticle was formed by complexatiort with TPP. It is also possible that myoglobin could be adsorbed onto the surface on the chitosan nanoparticles after formation, but the high speeds used in centrifugation cause it to dissociate into the supematant layer. -135-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation Figure 6-5: Sedimentation at 410 om , I I , : i j i : i i i i i i i , I I , I , , I I I I I \" ' \" I I , \"\" ,...

Six different chitosan were studied, the details of which are given in Table 6-2. Table 6-2: Physicochemical properties of Chitosans used in 20 The nanoparticles were prepared according to the method previously described in section 2.2.4. The quantities of TPP and chitosan solutions mixed were the same for each chitosan (quantities w\u00abre not optimised) so that a comparison could be made based solely on the effect of the molecular ~eight and degree of acetylation on nanoparticle production. Nanoparticle yield was determined using both the dry weight method (section 6.2.2.1.) and by measuring the concentration of chitosan in the supernatant using the ninhydrin assay (section 6.2.2.2.). The concentration of insulin in the supematant was measuring using HPLC (section 2.2.7) and from this the -137-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation association and loading efficiency of the nanoparticles was determined. Each measurement was carried out in triplicate. 6.4.1 Results and Discussion Table 6-3: Yields and insulin loading of nanoparticles prepared from various chitosan samples Yield(%) Association Loading ChitoSaD Weight - - 6.4.1.1 Yield The yields obtained usmg the two methods are not consistent for each chitosan. For chitosan 0112, the yield obtained from the dry weight method was almost twice that obtained using the ninhydrin assay. As mentioned in section 6.3, the most important step in determining the concentration of chitosan in the supematant layer is the centrifugation step. It was concluded that the speed and duration of this centrifugation step was sufficient to remove all the nanoparticles from the supematant layer as no decrease in chitosan concentration was observed after further centrifugation. This would suggest that in this case the results obtained from the dry weight method might be an overestimation of yield possibly due to inadequate drying. -138-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation From the yield obtained using the concentration of chitosan in the supematant, chitosan CL210 resulted in the highest yield of nanoparticles. Chitosan CL210 is a hydrochloride salt, which contains approximately 82% chitosan base, whereas the other chitosans studied are all glutamate salts, which contains about 55% chitosan base. Therefore chitosan CL210 would contain more chitosan base per volume, which would account for the higher yield observed. By studying the results obtained from the glutamate salts, the effect of degree of acetylation and molecular weight can be examined (Figure 6-6). Neither parameter showed any trend for its effect on yield. With the exception of chitosan GII2, there appears to be a slight tendency for decreasing degree of acetylation to increase yield. This could be explained by the increase in charged amino groups with decreasing acetylation. This would allow more ionic interaction to occur between chitosan and TPP leading to an increase in yield. With increasing molecular weight it may have been expected that the yield would increase due to the longer chain lengths of the chitosan molecules and hence an increase in charged amino groups (Figure 6-7). This effect was not observed, however, it is important to remember that in this study the effect of degree of acetylation and molecular weight could not be studied independently. -139-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation Figure 6-6: Yield of nanoparticles produced from various chitOllao shown as a function of degree of acetylation of chitosan 100 90 60 70 60 ~ ~ 50 \"'0 Qj >= 40 30 20 10 I : o 5 Dry Weight Yield Yield from chitosan conc in supematant I I I :a:: 10 15 20 25 Degree of Acetylation (%) I I 30 I 35 Figure 6-7: Yield ofnanoparticles produced from various chitosans shown as a function of molecular weight of chitosan 100 r Dry weight yield I 90 Yield from chitosan conc in supematant 60 70 I 60 ~ 50 I \"'0 I Qj 40 >= I :a:: 30 ! Loading Insulin loading of the chitosan nanoparticles was determined by measuring the loading efficiency and association efficiency as described in section 6.2.2.1. Nanoparticles produced using chitosan CL210 did not appear to encapsulate any insulin as the amount of insulin in the supematant was the same as the total amount added. From the results obtained using the glutamate salts, the association efficiency and loading efficiency of the nanoparticles appeared to increase with increasing molecular weight of the chitosan used (Figure 6-8). This can be explained by the increasing chain length of the chitosans, leading to increased physical entrapment of insulin. Xu and Du (2003) found, in a similar manner, that as the molecular weight of chitosan increased (same DA), the encapsulation of BSA increased. Chitosan with a molecular weight of 48 kDa has a relatively short chain length compared to BSA, which makes entrapment of BSA difficult, and so encapsulation efficiency was low. For chitosans with a molecular weight of 210 kDa and 115 kDa, encapsulation efficiency was much greater, and this was atlributed to the longer chains length of the chitosan molecules which could entrap a greater amount of BSA when gelated withTPP. The effect of degree of acetylation on insulin loading'did not show a distinct trend (Figure 6-9). Xu and Du (2003) found that as the degree of acetylation decreased for chitosans with the same molecular weight that the encapsulation of BSA increased. This was attributed to the chitosans with lower DA containing more functional groups that could complex with the acid groups of BSA and gelate with TPP so increasing Preparation Chitosans 0213 and 0213 * show the highest loading. This may be attributed to their high molecular weight and relatively low degree of acetylation (17 - 20%). For these chitosans it would be necessary to determine the optimal concentrations of chitosan and TPP, so as to further increase yield and insulin loading. -142-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation Figure 6-8: Insulin loading of nanoparticles produced from various cbitosans as a function of molecular weigbt of cbitosan 100 I Association Efficiency I ..-90 Loading Efficiency ::R I ~ 80 ~ t1 c 70 I Q) '0 lE 60 I w a 50 c '0 I'll 40 0 -l I 'C 30 0 ~ I '0 20 10 0 5.0x10\u00b7 Insulin loading of nanoparticies produced from various chitosans as a function of degree of acetyhltion of cbitosan 100 l : Association Efficiency I 90 Loading Efficiency ~ 1 ~ 80 ~ I c 70 Q) I '0 I ru 60 I I a c 50 '6 I'll 40 I 0 ! -l 'C 30 0 ~ I '0 20 J 10 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Degree of Acetylation (%) -143-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle G213 6.5.1 Methods to identify the optimal chitosan 0213 and TPP the achievement gelation and nanoparticle fonnation. A range of chitosan samples was prepared over the concentration range 1 - 5 mglml. To these solutions, varying amounts ofTPP was added and the resulting solution identified as clear (no nanoparticles formed), opalescent (nanoparticles present), or precipitate. 6.5.2 Results The results (Figure 6-10) indicate the resulting solution characteristics at each ratio of chitosan and TPP. For chitosan 0213 it would appear that the most appropriate concentration of chitosan in the final nanoparticle solution is between 1 -5 mglml and for TPP between 0.25 -0.5 mglml. These concentrations are similar to those obtained by Dyer et al. (2002) who found that opalescent suspensions were associated with fonnulations containing 0.2 -0.5 mglml TPP. The chitosan studied in Dyer et al. (2002) was the same as that used in this study. Calvo et al. (1997) investigated the\u00b7optimal concentrations for chitosan Seac~ 213 and found these to be in the order of 1-3 mglml for chitosan and 0.2-1.0 mglml for TPP, which are again in agreement with the concentrations identified in this study. To further determine which ratios of chitosan to TPP are most efficient i.e . . produce the highest yield of nanoparticles and loadinglassociation efficiency, several chitosanffPP ratios were chosen predicted to result in an opalescent solution. -144-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation Figure 6-10: concentrations appropriate ratios of chitosan G213 and TPP Cone.

The highest yield was obtained when the ratio was 6: 1. In general the yield increased as the ratio decreased. The yield of nanoparticles may be expected to increase as the concentration of chitosan increases; however, if the concentration of TPP is not high enough, the level of crosslinking between the two species would not be sufficient to cause enough aggregation to result in nanoparticle formation. This theory is reinforced by the observed increased yield at lower ratios, since the crosslinking will be denser. Femandez-Urrusuno et al. (1999) found that by increasing the amount of TPP with respect to chitosan, the nanoparticle yield increased which reinforces our findings. As the ratio of chitosan to TPP increases, the surface charge in the nanoparticles will also increase. This may result in higher loading of insulin due to increased ionic interaction between insulin and chitosan. Nanoparticles were prepared at ratios of 6:1 and 7:1 and the yield and insulin loading determined. The results are shown in Table 6-5. The yield of nanoparticles was greatest at the lower ratio due to the increased level of crosslinking as explained previously (Table 6-5). The loading efficiency and association efficiency was lowest for those nanoparticles prepared at the lower ratio despite the higher yield. This can be explained due to the reduced charge on the nanoparticles due to increased crosslinking with TPP. As mentioned previously insulin loading with chitosan nanoparticles is due to ionic interaction with the positively charged chitosan as well as hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding and some physical entrapment As the ratio of chitosan to TPP increases, the amount of remaining charged amino groups on -146-Chapter 6: Nanoparticle Preparation chitosan increases, and this will enable more interaction with insulin, and hence increased loading capacity. Fern8ndez-Urrusuno et al. (1999) also found that the loading capacity was affected by the insulin concentration and the chitosan:TPP ratio. Data indicated that insulin loading was directly related to the amount of insulin and chitosan but inversely related to the amount of TPP. This suggested that there was a competition between TPP and insulin in their ionic interaction with chitosan. -147-Chapter 7: Stability of Chitosan in complex Chapter 7: Stability of Chitosan in complex 7.1 Introduction In this chapter the effect on chitosan stability of i) complexation of chitosan with tripolyphosphate pentasodium (TPP) and ii) chitosan being in the solid state, is investigated. Chitosan nanopartic1es, as discussed in the previous chapter, were formed by ionotropic gelation using TPP as the counterion. In order to investigate the effect of complexation, and hence storage of chitosan in the solid state, on the stability of chitosan it is necessary to be able to dissociate the complex back to the starting components. To separate the complex formed between chitosan and TPP requires harsh conditions which could degrade chitosan in the process. It was therefore decided to evaluate the chitosan stability using a complex formed between chitosan and insulin that can be dissociated by altering the pH of the solution. 7.2 Methods 7.2.1 Preparation of Chitosan-Insulin Complex A 4 mg/ml chitosan solution (chitosan 0213*) was prepared by dissolving 200 mg chitosan 0213 in 40 ml ultra pure water and adjusting the pH to 5.5 by adding 0.1 M NaOH and making up the volume to 50 ml with ultrapure water. A 4 mg/ml human zinc insulin solution was prepared by dissolving 200 mg zinc insulin in 40 ml ultrapure water adjusted to pH 4.0 with O.lM NaOH . . When the insulin was dissolved the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with O.lM HCl and the volume made up to 50 ml with water. -148-Chapter 7: Stability of Chitosan in complex The complexes were prepared by adding dropwise 50ml of 4 mglml insulin solution to 50ml of the 4 mglml chitosan solution under vigorous stirring with a magnetic stirrer. The pH of the final solution was between 5.5 -5.7. The complex was divided into 10ml aliquots and stored under ambient conditions until the required testing date. 7.2.2 Molecular Weight Determination To determine the molecular weight of chitosan after the stated storage period, dissociation of the complex is necessary. The isoelectirc point of insulin is 5.3; above this pH insulin is negatively charged and will form ionic interaction with chitosan resulting in a complex. Below this pH, insulin becomes predominantly positively charged. Therefore by lowering the pH of the medium in which the chitosan-insulin complex is suspended, the complex will dissociate since both components are now positively charged, soluble and will repel each other. The 10ml aliquot was divided into two, one 5ml aliquot is centrifuged and the supematant removed and stored. To the supematant and the other 5 ml aliquot a drop of 1M HCI is added to dissociate any complex (PH of solution -4). This solution is then filtered through a 0.45 J.Ull filter and analysed using SEC- MALLS as described in Section 2.2.3.1. and the molecular weight determined. The use of SEC-MALLS to determine the molecular weight of chitosan in this solution is possible since the insulin, which will still be present in the solution, will not be detectable on the column system used here. 7.2.3 Stability of Chltosan .. lnsulin Complex Duritig storage it is possible that the chitosan-insulin complex may dissociate. To determine the stability of the complex over the storage period, the amount -149-Chapter 7: Stability of Chi to san in complex of chitosan and insulin in the supernatant was determined at each time interval using the ninhydrin assay and HPLC respectively (see sections 2.2.6. and 2.2.7.). 7.3 Results 7.3.1 Stability of Chitosan in complex As mentioned in section 7.2.2., the determination of the molecular weight of chitosan using SEC-MALLS is possible without the removal of insulin from the solution since insulin is not detectable in the system used. Insulin has a molecular weight of 9000 kDa whereas the chitosan used in the study has an initial molecular weight of 207500 kDa. The system chosen will elute the insulin at the end of the run (volume 30ml). An example of the SEC-MALLS traces for insulin and chitosan 0213* are shown in Figures 7-1 and 7-2 respectively. The insulin trace shows no recorded light scattering or refractive index signal during the experimental run time. Table 7-1 shows the molecular weight determined using SEC-MALLS for chitosan stored as a complex over a two-month period. Degradation of chitosan does occur with a decrease in molecular weight of approximately 10% (to.05,3df= 3.182; t = 1.22 therefore not significantly different). The same chitosan (0213*) was stored in acetate buffer, pH 4.3 for a two-month period and a decrease in molecular weight of approximately 43% was observed (results also shown in Table 7.1). From these results it would appear that by storing chitosan as a complex and thereby in the solid state, and also possibly in nanoparticle form, the stability in aqueous solution is increased. However, it should be noted that the pHs of the two storage media were different. The complex was suspended in water at -150-Chapter 7: Stability of Chit os an in complex approximately pH 5.7, whereas the chitosan solution was in acetate buffer, pH 4.3. As was shown in Figure 4.6, Section 4.3.3., as the pH of the chitosan solution decreases, the rate of degradation of chitosan increases due to acid hydrolysis occurring. These effects were also shown by Vdrum et al. (2001). The results obtained here should therefore be treated with caution due to the different storage conditions. In order to clarity that storage of chitosan in nanoparticle form or as a complex does improve its stability, it would be necessary to compare its degradation in solution at the same pH as the medium in which the nanoparticles/complex are suspended. 7.3.2 Stability of Chitosan-Insulin Complex It has been demonstrated that storage of chitosan as a complex may improve its stability. However, it is also necessary to show that the chitosan-insulin complex remains intact over the storage period. To demonstrate this, the amount of insulin and chitosan in the supematant was determined over the two-month period, as well as the total amount present after dissociation of the complex. The results are shown in Table 7-2. After two weeks, the amount of chitosan and insulin present in the complex has increased. This would indicate that after the initial measurement, that further complexation occurred. Over the next six weeks, the amount of chitosan and insulin complexed remained constant, indicatillg that the chitosan-insulin complex was steady over the two-month storage period. -151-Chapter 7: Stability of Chitosan in complex Figure 7-1: SEC-MALLS insulin solution mglmJ) 0.20 .

These studies have highlighted the problems that are encountered when determining the molecular weight of chitosan due to non-ideality and how the use of SEC-MALLS can provide a quick and accurate measure. The main focus of the project has been the degradation of chitosan in solution and the possibilities of constructing stable chitosan based nanoparticles for nasal delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides. 8.1 Mo/ecular Weight Determination and Conformation The measurement of molecular weight of a polymer can provide information on its potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry. It is therefore important to be able to accurately measure the molecular weight by a convenient method. The molecular weight of chitosan was determined using two absolute techniques: sedimentation equilibrium using the analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and SEC-MALLS. The time required for these techniques is very different. AUC requires the measurement of molecular weight at several concentrations, and the experiment takes approximately three days to perform. Several concentrations are required due to non-idealiD> as was explained in Chapter 3. SEC-MALLS, on the other hand, only requires the measurement of the molecular weight using one concentration and the experiment only take one hour to perform. The effects of -154-Chapter 8: Conclusions and Suggested Further Work non-ideality are negligible due to dilution of the sample that occurs as it flows through the column system. The column system chosen for SEC-MALLS provided good separation of the chitosan sample and there was excellent sample recovery (~9()o1o), which indicated that the chitosan did not interact with the column packing material. The results obtained from both techniques were in good agreement showing that SEC\u00ad MALLS can be used as a quick and simple method for the determination of the molecular weight of chitosan. Information on the conformation of chitosan can help us to understand the application of chitosan as a bioadhesive material in drug delivery. From the information we gathered using the power-law or \"Mark Houwink Kuhn Sakurada exponents, we can see chitosan exists as an extended coil in aqueous acidic solutions (power law coefficients b = 0.25 \u00b1 0.04 and a = 0.96 \u00b1 0.10). These parameters appear consistent with the data obtained from other groups (Anthonsen et ai, 1993, and Berth, COlfen and Dautzenberg 2002), although interpretations in terms of conformation can be complicated by the existence of possible solvent draining effects from the chain (see Berth, Colfen and Dautzenberg, 2002). Since chitosan exists in an extended conformation there is likely to be a greater chance of interaction between that negatively charged sialic acid groups present in the mucus lining the mucosal membranes and the positively charged amino groups on chitosan. This will favour increased bioadhesion and facilitate improved absorption of the protein or peptide that is being delivered, vindicating the choice of chitosan as a mucoadhesive system. -155-Chapter 8: Conclusions and Suggested Further Work 8.2 Degradation of Chitosan in aqueous solution In the first section of this thesis, the stability of chitosan was investigated. It was found that an increase in temperature increased the degradation rate and that changes in ionic strength over the range studied had no effect on degradation rate. The ionic strength range that was studied was narrow and it may have been found that over a greater range an effect on degradation may have been observed. This may have been due to changes in the confonnation of chitosan with larger increases in ionic strength. If the ionic strength were increased sufficiently, chitosan would exist as a coiled molecule in solution due to shielding of the charged amino groups along the chain. This may increase its stability, as it would be harder for the hydroxyl ions to penetrate into the coiled molecule and hydrolysis the glycosidic bonds. The most important factor was found to be the pH of the solution. It was found that as the pH of the solution decreased, i.e. as the solution became more acidic, the rate of degradation increased. This result indicates that acid hydrolysis, which results in the cleavage of the glycosidic bonds, plays an important role in the degradation of chitosan. Initial studies on the effect of pH showed the opposite effect, i.e. increased degradation at elevated pH, but I attributed this to incomplete dissolution of the chitosan under low-acidic conditions, a consequence of the cationic nature of this polysaccharide. Scavenging agents, which will be effective in reducing degradation caused by oxidative reductive degradation, were also investigated but showed no significant effect on degradation, suggesting that oxidative degradation -156-Chapter 8: Conclusions and Suggested Further Work was not a accountable for a significant amount of chitosan degradation in solution. In conclusion, the main mechanism of degradation of chitosan in aqueous solution appears to be acid hydrolysis, and, encouragingly, for the pH range that would be used for a nasal formulation, the amount of degradation is not significant as was shown by the multi-factorial three month stability study. The effect of molecular weight and degree of acetylation on chitosan degradation is also worthy of serious comment. For the molecular weight range studied, no significant effect was observed. However, it was found that the rate of degradation decreased as the DA of the chitosan decreased. I attributed this to the increase in the number of charged amino groups on chitosan as the DA decreased, which protects the glycosidic oxygen from protonation i.e. the first stage in acid hydrolysis. As the number of charged groups on the chitosan molecule increases, there may also be enhanced bioadhesion which would also be advantageous in drug delivery via mucosal membranes. Taking into account these two parameters (degradation and degree of bioadhesion) it would appear that the most important structural parameter to consider when selecting a chitosan is its degree of acetylation. B.3 Nanopartic/e Production and Chitosan Stability For the nasal delivery of'insulin, current research is focussed on the use of chitosan nanoparticies. These possess both the mucoadhesive and absorption enhancing properties of chitosan as well as delivery the drug to the site of absorption in a high concentration. -157-Chapter 8: Conclusions and Suggested Further Work The effect of molecular weight and degree of acetylation of the yield and loading capacity of chitosan nanoparticles was investigated. It was found that to improve the yield of nanoparticles a decrease in the degree of acetylation, DA of the chitosan molecule was beneficial. This can be explained by the increase in the number of charged groups on the chitosan molecule, which increases the possible sites for interaction between chitosan and tripolyphosphate. TPP. To increase the loading of the nanoparticles it was found that higher molecular weight chitosans were best. By increasing the molecular weight, the chain length of the chitosan molecule will increase, which could increase the physical entrapment of insulin. The effect of DA on loading capacity did not show any distinct trend but it would be expected that as with yield, a lower DA would be best due to the increased number of charged amino groups. I also investigated the effect of formulating nanoparticles on the stability of chitosan was investigated. The stability of the nanoparticles was assessed by determining the molecular weight of chitosan using SEC-MALLS after the chitosan-insulin complex had been dissociated. The results obtained were compared with the degradation of chitosan only in a solution of the same pH. The results showed a small improvement in stability (approximately 30%), but this was not significant. It is worth making the comment that the time scale of the stability trail was relatively short (only two months) and this is rather short compared with the storage data that would be required for a marketed pharmaceutical product. It may be. found that over a longer storage period, the amount of degradation -158-Chapter 8: Conclusions and Suggested Further Work observed when chitosan is in a dispersion in complexed nanoparticle form compared to the case of a molecular solution form, is significantly different - this is clearly a case for further study. 8.4 Further Work It is still not sure how the level of degradation observed in both chitosan solution and chitosan nanoparticles will affect the absorption enhancing properties of chitosan. This could be investigated by simultaneously measuring degradation and bioadhesion. A factorial experiment could be carried out to look at the effect of molecular weight and degree of acetylation (over a wider range tan covered in this thesis) on degradation and along side the molecular weight or viscosity measurements taken a measure of bioadhesion could be taken. After evaluation of these experiments, a study could be carried out in sheep using a selected range of chitosan sample (best, worst and middle), to investigate the effect of degradation of the absorption enhancing properties. These experiments could be carried out using both a simple chitosan solution as well as using chitosan nanoparticles. From this study we may find that as the chitosan sample is degraded the bioadhesion and absorption enhancing properties decrease due to a reduced number of charged amine groups on the chito.san chain. -159-References Angelo, R., D.

NG72TN, UK Introduction I?espite their increasing importance (see FIg. 1)] have dIfl?cult to characterize with regard to ~~lecu!ar ~eIght owmg to their polycationic nature. ThIS IS pnmartly because of the failure of results from SEC:-MALLS (s~e-exclusion chromatography coupled on-hne to a multI-angl~ 1.a.ser li~bt-scattering detector) to agree ?r show compatibIlity With other techniques such as sedImentation eqUilibrium in the ultracentrifu~e or measurements from viscometry. These difficulties have l~rgely be~n attributed to anomalous behaviour on the sl~e-exclus~on columns that have been available, and dls~repancles of over an order of magnitUde in the weIght ave~age molecular weight have been observed. When dIssolved in aqueous acidic medium chitosan bec?~es applications in the food and phar\u00ad include, for example, con\u00ad tr?lled flavour ~elease from tablets or using techmques, film fillers I>~ticular SInce It possesses mucoadhesive prop\u00ad erties ~se~, Harding et resu~t tn mcreased contact'time with a mucosal surface leadIng to enhanced drug absorption, and has also been dem?nstrated to enhance the, delivery of proteins and peptldes across mucosal membranes et al. 2000; Davis 2001). The mucoadhe\u00ad slve properties have been attributed to interactions betwee? the -NH3 + groups left after deacetylation of the chltm and the tenninal -COO-(sialic acid) on surfaces, reinforced hydrophobic of un-deacetylated residues on chltosan WIth fucose on mucins (Deacon et al. 1999). 458 o n R=AcorH Fig. 1 Schematic representation of chitosan; R = acetyl or H, depending on the degree of acetylation Chitosan has also been shown to cause a transient widening of the tight junctions of the epithelial cells in vitro, which is thought to contribute to enhanced drug permeability (IlIum and Davis 2001; IlIum et aI. 2001). For many applications of chitosan, and esp~iaJJy in the pharmaceutical industry, the molecular weight and degree of acetylation dicta~e the properties .and thereb.y the effectiveness of the chltosan for a particular applI\u00ad cation. For example, Schipper et al. (1996) have reported that both these properties are very important for its absorption enhancement of hydrophilic drugs across mucosal surfaces. They found that a low degree of acetylation and/or high molecular w~igh! appeared ~~ be necessary for chitosans to increase epltheJtal permeabilIty. It is clear that the pharmaceutically important properties of chitosan (including solubility) are not only dependent on their chemical nat';lre (dl~tated by t.he degree of acetylation), but propertles (molecular weight and conformation) .. Altho';lgh the degree of acetylation can be measured With considerable confidence [e.g. by NMR (Varum et aI. 1991)], it is also important to be able to attach some degree of confidence to the SEC/MALLS determination m~thod for m?le\u00ad cular weight. Successful molecular chitosan by SEC/MALLS have been rCJ?orted by Beri et al. (1993). However, these aut~ors did not compare their results with those from ot~er mdepen~ent techniques. Attempts at molecular weIght de~ermma\u00ad tions by SEC/MALLS in our own laboratones have previously proved difficult due to the anomalous behaviour of chitosan on our SEC columns, an~ results were generally incompatible with tho~e obtamed by sedimentation equilibrium in the cationic nature of chito~ IS responsl~le for its wide range of desirable interactions; however, It ~ay also cause interactions with the SEC colu~n packing material and/or residues from other prev~ously run samples. A dedicated column system for chltosan was therefore used for the re-examination of the use of SEC/ MALLS which was considered important due to: I The ease of obtaining absolute molecular weight . data from SEC-MALLS compared with the use of other methods. Since 1991 (Horton et al. 1991; Rollings 1991, 1992), this method has become !he most popular for char~cterizing ,Polysaccharide molecular weights in solution, and, smce 1996, also glycoconjugates such as mucus glycoproteins (Jumel et al. 1996, 1997). 2. The belief that there is a clear link between the functional properties of chitosans and their muco\u00ad adhesive and epithelial absorption enhancement capabilities for drug delivery and film forming po\u00ad tential for healthcare products (e.g. shampoos). This paper explores the use of SEC/MALLS for four polysaccharides of pharmaceutical grade covering a range of degree of acetylation, DA (4-30%), and molecular weight. Comparative molecular weight data were obtained by sedimentation equilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifuge. A correlation of the Mark\u00ad Houwink-Kuhn-Sakurada (MHKS) power-law type is also attempted between weight average molecular weight, Mw, and both the intrinsic viscosity or the sed\u00ad imentation coefficient to check for consistency between the data and to see if these particular chitosans of dif\u00ad ferent DA and Mw approximate a homologous series. Materials and methods Materials Four chitosans were provided by Pronova Biomedical, Oslo, Norway (G112, G\\ 14, G213 and G214). These were glutamate salts with DA values ranging from 4 to 30% and of reputedly different molecular weight, as indicated by the dynamic viscosity values (of 1 % solutions) provided by Pronova (Table I). A separate batch of G213 was also supplied. For all experiments, the chitosan samples were dissolved in a 0.2 M acetate buffer (pH 4.3). For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, samples were dialysed against the buffer solution overnight so that the chemical potential of the solvent was equal in both the sample solution and the reference solvent (dialysate). Methods Molecular weight: sedimentation equilibrium Low-speed sedimentation equilibrium was used to determine the molecular weights (weight averages) of the various chitosans. Two analytical ultracentrifuges (AUCs) were employed. Firstly, a Beckman XL-l Analytical Ultracentrifuge was used for cltitosan solutions in the range of concentrations 0.5-1.0 mg/mL, at a rotor speed of 14,000 rpm (sample G112) or 8000 rpm (the other sam\u00ad ples) and a temperature of 20.0 \u00b0C. The data collected from the Rayleigh interference optical system were analysed using the MSTARI algorithm (Colfen and Harding 1997) to give an appar\u00ad ent weight average molecular weight, Mw.app. A low concentration sample (0.3 mg/mL) was also analy~d using a Beckman Model E Table 1 Commercial manufacturer's data (courtesy 20 4 acetylation (%) Viscosity of 1% 5 18 79 153 59 solution (mPa s) *G213(a), batch no. 610-583-09; G213(\\\u00bb, batch no. FPI-A-708-01 Analytical Ultracentrifuge (at rotor speeds between 10,000 and 20,000 rpm and a temperature of 20.0 0c) equipped with Schlieren optics, adapted with a CCD camera system (Clewlow et al. 1997) for automatic capture of the optical data. Use was made of the long optical path cells (30 mm), impossible to use in the XL-I. The data were analysed by fitting to the Lamm equation (see, for example, Clewlow et aL 1997): (I) where v is the partial specific volume (mL/g) determined by pre\u00ad cision densimetry for each chitosan (Kratky et al. 1973), P the solvent density (m!l.~ R is the gas constant and T the ~emperature (K). A plot of In(~fr) versus ,2 has a slope proportional to the apparent z-average molecular weight (Mzapp)' The data set was then transformed by integrating with respect to r (distance from the centre of rotation in cm) and analysed using MST ARI (Colfen and Harding 1997) to obtain Mw.app. To account for non-ideahty, the reciprocal of the apparent weight average molecular weights Mw,.pp determined over. a range of concentrations, c, were extrapolate.~ to zero ~o!\"centratl~n. The thermodynamic or \"osmotic pressure second vmal coe~clent, B, and the \"ideal\" or \"true\" weight average molecular weight, \"'!w, were estimated from plots of I/Mw,.pp versus concentratIOn according to (see. for example, Harding I 995a): l/Mw,app = (l/Mw)(l + 2BMwc) (2) Molecular weight: SEC-MALLS The molecular weights (weight averages) of the chitosan samples were then also determined by using SEC-MA~LS. Acetate buffer, pH 4.3, was pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/mm through a column system consisting of TSK-G5000PW, TSK-G4000PW and TSK\u00ad G3000PW analytical columns protected b~ a guard column.

Sedimentation coefficients (Sobs) were obtained by analysing \"time deriv\u00ad ative\" algorithm DCDT+ (Philo 2000). These were corrected to standard solvent conditions (the density and viscosity of water at 20.0 0c) using the sedimentation coefficient in terms of the standard solvent water at 20\u00b0C; Sobs is the measured sedimentation coeffi\u00ad cient solvent/buffer at temperature T; P20,w and '120,w are the density and viscosity of water at 20\u00b0C and PT,b is the density and viscosity of the buffer used for the experiments at temperature T. Measurements were made at a series of low con\u00ad centrations (0.3-1.0 mg/mL) to minimize non-ideality; nonetheless, S20,w values reciprocals thereof) were then extrapolated to infi\u00ad nite dilution to yield sOzo,w' Determination of intrinsic viscosity Intrinsic viscosities were determined using an Ostwald-type vis\u00ad cometer of 2 mL capacity over a concentration range of 0.2-2.0 mg/ mL. The flow times were recorded at 20.00::1:0.01 cC. From the solution/solvent flow-time ratio the kinematic relative viscosity was obtained. Because of the low concentrations used ( < I mg/mL), the density corrections were assumed to be negligible and the kinematic viscosities were assumed to be approximately equal to the dynamic viscosities (Tanford 1955). The intrinsic viscosity was found by extrapolation to infinite dilution of the reduced viscosities using the Huggins equation (see, for example, Harding 1997).

From the light-scattering traces it can be seen that in each case the peaks from the macromolecular compo\u00ad nent are skewed and not symmetri9al. There was also evidence of persistently occurring trace amounts of high molecular weight aggregate from the 90\u00b0 angle light\u00ad scattering traces, as indicated by the shoulders on the low elution volume or high molecular weight side of the light-scattering peaks. However, except. for sample 0112 these light-scattering signals are not accompanied by co~responding RI (concentration) signals, indicating that only negligible amounts \u00ab 1%) are present in the samples. No such supramolecular particles were -ru observed from the sedimentation time-derivative DCDT + anal\u00ad ysis, which showed only a single, approximately symmetrical, peak for in each case, including 0112 (Fig. 3), and no fast moving supramolecular boundary was observed. Significance of non-ideality: advantage of SEC-MALLS Both the SEC-MALLS and the sedimentation equilib\u00ad rium methods allow direct evaluation of the absolute molecular weight of the macromolecule. However, the time scale for each method varies greatly, with the SEC\u00ad MALLS measurement taking approximately 60 minutes (after appropriate equilibration of the SEC columns). The sedimentation equilibrium method, on the other hand, can require up to 3 days for equilibrium to be reached per sample.

Such effects can normally be suppressed by charge shielding simply by increasing the ionic str~ngth of the solution medium. Unfortunately for chltosans, large increases in ionic strength lead to re\u00ad duced solubility and salting out can occur. thermodynamic non-ideality effects cannot be neglected and measurements at several concentrations (and extrapolation to infinite dilution) are normally required. The problem is particularly acute for chitosans because suppression of one of the two main causes of solution non-ideality -polyelectrolyte behaviour -by increasing ionic strength is only partially possible because of sol\u00ad ubility problems. We explain further: non-ideality causes the molecular weight for chitosan calculated from AUC data to be lower than the true molecular weight. There are two major contributing factors to this phenomenon: the ex\u00ad cluded volume and the polyelectrolye effect. The ex\u00ad cluded volume arises from one molecule excluding another from the space occupied by it. For a sphere the excluded volume is eight times the molecular volume: the more extended the molecule (e.g. through intramolecular charge repulsion effects if the molecule is charged), the greater the excluded volume. Another contribution to exclusion volume comes from the swelling of the mole\u00ad cule through \"hydration\" or time-averaged association with water molecules. For a polysaccharide molecule in solution, the swollen volume can be 100 times its volume in the dry state (see, for example, Harding 1995b). The second contribution to solution thermodynamic non\u00ad ideality comes from polyelectrolyte phenomena through intermolecular repulsions. Such effects will be large for chitosan owing to the high charge density on the mole\u00ad cule (e.g. for a molecule of \",10% DA, there will be \",90 To illustrate the significance of the non-ideality we have included in Table 2 values for the term 2.BM (2xsecond virial coefficientxweight average molecula'; weight) in a spherical, uncharged molecule this would hav~ a value of approximately 5--10 mL/g, and the value mcreases as the system deviates from ideality. From Table 2 it can be seen that values calcu\u00ad ~ate.d [a comparative table for polysaccharides is gi\u00ad ven in Harding (1995b)J. At very low solute concentrations, ideal behaviour is approached (Van Holde 1998) and the effects of non\u00ad ideality should be small. For many systems of biological macromolecules, parycularly globular proteins, measurement at a single finite, but low (0.2--0.5 mgjmL) concentration can give an estimate of the apparent molecular weight within' a few percent of the true molecular weight. However, even with loading concentrations as low as 0.2 mgfmL there can be non\u00ad negligible underestimates of the true molecular weight (Harding 1992) for those polysaccharides yielding solutions of high 2BM w values; chitosan a,ppears to be in that category (Harding I 995b). The problem is compounded since the modern commercial instrument (XL-I) permits a minimum concentration of not 0.2 but 0.5 mg/mL. 462 With SEC-MALLS, however, there is normally no need to correct for non-ideality in the system so long as the sample is diluted in the columns to such an extent that the concentrations of the volume \"slices\" passing through the light-scattering detector are much lower 0.60 0.65 0.50 0.45 than the initial loading concentration. These concen\u00ad trations are usually 0.1 mg/mL or less (depending on the ~ molecular weight of the scatterer), and corrections \u00b0Wo arising from thermodynamic 0.40 Inertness of the SEC column Although the SEC-MALLS method of determining the molecular weight of chitosan is very quick and simple, there may still remain some uncertainties in terms of the \"inertness\" of the column packing materials and in the extrapolation of the angular intensity functions to zero angle, as highlighted by Harding (l995b). The former appears to be particularly important in the case of cationic polyelectrolytes; however, it seems that the use of a dedicated column system can eliminate most of these uncertainties. Nevertheless, it is still advisable to determine the molecular weight using the AUC to obtain a reliable and independent verification of the results. Conformation The conformation of chitosans has been the subject of considerable interest over the last decade, particularly with the regard to the effect of the degree of acetylation of the molecule, the molecular weight and the solvent conditions in which it is studied (see, e.g. Wang et al. 1991; Anthonsen et al. 1993; Errington et al. 1996; Berth al. 1998; C61fen et al. 2001; Berth and Dautzenberg 2002). Many methods for assaying the conformation of chitosan and other polysaccharides in solution appear to be based on the dependence of a solution parameter (such as intrinsic viscosity, radius of gyration or sedi\u00ad mentation coefficient) with molecular weight. The simplest are the Mark-HQuwink-Kuhn-Sakurada type of scaling or power-law plots of log(parameter) versus 10g(Mw) (see, e.g. Smidsr0d and Andresen 1979; Tombs and Harding 1997). Figures 4 and 5 shows such plots for the four chitosans of this study in terms of logso2o.w versus 10gMw and log[tl] versus 10gMw, respectively. The SEC-MALLs values for Mw have been included, and an additional data point has been included corresponding to a separate batch of G213, called G213(b. A linear fit to the logso2o,w versus 10gMw data yielded an MHKS exponent b = 0.25 \u00b1 0.04, i.e. between the limits of rod (0.15) and coil (0.4--0.5). Similarly, a linear fit to the log[tl) versus 10gM w scaling data yielded an . MHKS exponent a=0.96\u00b1O.lO, again between the cod (0.5-0.6) and rod 0.25 0.20 0.15 4.6 4.8 5.2 5.4 5.6 Fig. 4 Double logarithmic plot of sedimentation coefficient versus weight average molecular weight (SEC\u00b7 MALLs values) 3.2 3.0 2.8 2.6 _ 2.4 !=' '\"1! 2.2 ~ 2.0 1.8 1.6 1.4 4.5 5.5 Fig. 5 Double logarithmic plot of intrinsic viscosity versus weight average molecular weight (SEC-MALLs values) (1.8) limits. However, interpretation of such data should be done with caution because of claims by others of a dependence of conformation on the degree of acetylation (see, e.g. Anthonsen et al. 1993). Despite this reservation, the values obtained appear similar to those for three chitosans of DA in the range 22-31% (C6lfen et al. 2001): ~1 and b~0.24. Furthermore, the data reassuringly show consistency between the sedimentation coefficient and viscosity data. More advanced analyses, such as involving normalized scal\u00ad ing relations (Pavlov et al. 1997, 1999), can be used to take into account the differences in DA, but these await knowledge of the mass per unit length of chito\u00ad sans as a function of DA. It should also be pointed out that if the sedimentation equilibrium values for Mw are used instead, different values of a and b are returned (\",1.5 and 0.5, respectively), although these values are based on only four data points. Conclusions Confidence in our ability to measure molecular weight and conformation accurately is of particular relevance to the use of chitosans for the delivery of substances across the mucosal membrane through bioadhesion and absorption enhancement through transient widening of tight junctions (Kotze et al. 1997). Larger molecular weights and more extended conformations would appear to offer more opportunities for interaction. In conclusion, however, although much better agree\u00ad ment is now possible between SEC-MALLs and sedi\u00ad mentation equilibrium, some caution still needs to be exercised when interpreting molecular weight data for these materials, particularly with regards to the trace amounts of high molecular weight material appearing in the SEC-MALLs profiles. The use of two independent methods for determining the molecular weights for these substances is still highly recommended.
