Acid reflux natural remedy? I think my FF 8 week old has been suffering from acid reflux. Originally I thought it was gas and have switched formulas 3 times now because he was not pooping until every 3-4 days. Now he is on enfamil gentlease and is at least pooping once a day, which is progress but is still displaying other symptoms. I use dr. Brown bottles, give him gerber soothe drops (probiotic), gripe water occasionally and gas drops in every bottle. I feed him upright and burp him, keep him upright after feeding. He has the symptoms of pulling away/arching his back and screaming while drinking from the bottle, even though he is still hungry for more. He does not spit up often and doesn't seem to be in pain when he does. He is gaining weight, although I worry he isn't drinking as much as he would because he's in pain. I spoke to me pedi and she said I'm doing everything She would recommend. And they treat reflux with Zantac but only if it's really bad, as 40% of babies have some form of acid reflux. I see many of you use baby zantac- do you give it everyday or is it only when the baby has discomfort? I'm wondering if anyone knows of a natural remedy that I could try before trying Zantac? I read about some natrum phosphoricum, or nat phos. It's sodium phosphate and occurs naturally in the body. Anyone have any experience with this? Sorry for the long post - I hate seeing my baby in such pain and would appreciate any suggestions!!

I can completely understand wanting to find the natural solution first. I just wanted to answer your question regarding Zantac. You give 2 doses a day and the amount given depends on their weight. Some suggest you give it to them 30 minutes before a meal but we found that to be too hard because it would require you to wake the baby up if napping just to provide dose and I refuse to do that. We usually give it prior to the feeding. Same here, I can't give it to her 30 minutes before feeding because I'm not going to wake her up and then just let her cry for half an hour. Also it's disgusting! She spits it out! Yes! It had to be natural for me.. I found it and is a life-changer!!! My baby girl WAS having severe gas and reflux. It was getting worse and we were both in tears over it daily. Finally, after 4 weeks of non-stop research, I found a solution. 1. Hyland's Natural Homeopathic Relief of Indigestion, Gas, Hyperacidity [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001TMPIK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_.6Bszb8MECC0D?tag=wte-community-20](//www.amazon.com/dp/B0001TMPIK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_.6Bszb8MECC0D?tag=wte-community-20) Give 1 tablet after each feeding. Safe for any age... don't dose according to bottle. Again, 1 tablet following each feeding. 2. BioAmicus COMPLETE Infant & Toddler Probiotic Drops with 10 PROBIOTIC STRAINS [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXM9YZM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_e-Bszb3YSBPDM?tag=wte-community-20](//www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXM9YZM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_e-Bszb3YSBPDM?tag=wte-community-20) Give one dose daily. I was beside myself in tears before this... now instead of crying together, my baby girl and I are laughing together! It's important to do both remedies laid out above. Wow, that sounds amazing!!!! How soon until it got better? I'm ebf, how can I give those tablets to my baby? My baby gets Zantac twice a day and he feels soooooooo much better!! Like night and day. My kid literally cried 24-7 and only slept on my chest bc of reflux and colic. Since the day I took her to a chiropractor for an adjustment (at 4 weeks) she's been sleeping in her crib alone, she doesn't spit up and she went from inconsolably crying day and night to the normal crying for feedings and when sleepy. Since then she's on zero prescriptions and no more gas drops and gripe water. It was our family's saving grace and I can't say enough about how I'm incredibly thankful I am to have been open to the experience. What treatment was it exactly, which method? Like craniosacral? I can understand you wanting to find a natural remedy as well but keep in mind that most over the counter herbal or homeopathic remedies are not regulated by the FDA and therefore the ingredients are not guaranteed and neither is the safety. Most of these remedies do not even undergo any testing or clinical trials. My little one also has reflux and it's been on ranitidine (Zantac) since week 3 and it's made a huge difference in her comfort when eating and success in gaining weight. And it makes me feel better to know that it has been tested in young infants for safety. We give it twice a day and her dose goes up as she grows - right now she's on 0.8 mL and she weighs close to 11 pounds which is a small dose. -pharmacistmama :) - 1 - 1 You May Also Like [First YearColic in Babies](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/health-and-safety/what-is-colic/) [First YearHave a Gassy Baby?
