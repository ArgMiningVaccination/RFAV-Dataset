Our natural shampoo bars are a lot more concentrated than liquid shampoos. They contain extra oils and butters to nourish your hair. If you do not build a nice lather and rinse really well you will have areas that remain coated with the soap oils, which can make it look or feel \"gummy.\" Notice that we do NOT recommend lathering up the length of your hair with the shampoo bar. As you use your fingers to rinse the lather through the strands, there is enough shampoo to clean the length. This technique helps prevent coating your hair strands with shampoo residue. If you are new to shampoo bars please our blog, [\"How to Use a Natural Shampoo Bar\"](/blogs/idas-soap-box-blog/how-to-use-a-natural-shampoo-bar/) for more detailed information. Our Favorite Technique This technique helps prevent pockets of shampoo residue in the length of your hair especially if you have long or thick hair. Wet Hair: One of the most important steps is to begin with thoroughly wet hair--I mean a lot of water. Be sure that the water saturates your hair all the way down to the roots. Create the Lather: There are two possible ways both of which help prevent pockets of shampoo residue left in your hair that can make hair feel tacky. - Create a nice foamy lather by rubbing the wet bar between your hands, a soap pouch, or a natural sponge, and use only the lather to wash your scalp. - Create a nice foamy lather by rubbing the shampoo bar on the TOP of your head only. Rub in only one direction to prevent tangling. Massage the Lather into your Scalp only at the roots of the hair until you work up a really good lather - It is very important to work the shampoo into your scalp with water and really build up a good lather so there are no patches of shampoo left on your hair. - Lathering up also allows the dirt and extra oils to be washed away. - If the lather is not foamy enough, add more water. Using your Fingers like a Comb: smooth the lather down the length of your hair as you rinse with water. To prevent tangles, be sure to always work from the top down, use your fingers like a comb, not a mixer, and don't pile your hair on your head, Rinse, rinse, rinse, rinse and rinse again. I cannot stress how important this step is to shampoo bar success. In order to remove the excess shampoo, which can leave a filmy feeling and weigh hair down, do NOT rush this step! The rinsing should take longer than washing and lathering time. - If your hair is long or thick, lift up sections of your hair to ensure that all of the shampoo is rinsed clean. - Don't neglect parts of your head that are more difficult to reach, such as the nape of your neck or the back of your head. - Repeat if desired. If your hair has a residue before or after shampooing, use an [Apple Cider Vinegar Rinse ](/collections/apple-cider-vinegar-hair-rinse/)or a [baking soda clarifying rinse](/blogs/idas-soap-box-blog/baking-soda-clarifying-rinse/).

Most people find that shampoo bars are easier on color-treated hair than commercial shampoos. We have many customers who color their hair and use our gentle shampoo bars. One customer who \"darkens\" her hair wrote to tell us that she is now able to go one month longer before recoloring her hair. Another customer who \"lightens\" her hair, wrote that the color stays \"nicer\" longer and she does not get that \"brassy\" blonde color anymore. All of our shampoo bars are mild enough for color-treated hair, but since everyone's hair and coloring products are different, please do a strand test to judge for yourself. To do a strand test, shampoo a strand of hair in a non-conspicuous area and rinse. Notice if there are any changes. For color-treated hair, we recommend creating a lather in your hands rather than rubbing the bar directly on your head. Then using your fingers massage the lather into your scalp at the roots of the hair until you work up a really good lather. It is also best to rinse color-treated hair with cool or lukewarm, not hot, water. Choose your shampoo bar based on your hair type, knowing that coloring hair may change its texture. Permanent hair color does not simply stain your hair but penetrates the shaft to alter the natural hair pigment. Since the outer cuticle of the hair has been penetrated by the hair dye, your natural hair oil may have trouble penetrating the hair shaft. As a result, your hair may become more dry or brittle. Since it takes time for the hair cuticles to fully close and trap in the color, be sure to follow the directions from your salon or the product package as to how soon you should shampoo after coloring hair. Also, note that chlorinated water can change the hue of your color-treated hair. The good thing about the shampoo bars is that they actually prolong color - before I started using them, I'd have to dye my hair every 3 weeks, now it's every 5-6 weeks.

Shampoo Bars Are One Of Our Favorite Discoveries! The wholesome goodness of our handcrafted soap is available for your hair. Shampoo bars are an all natural conditioning shampoo in a solid bar form. Yes, this is real shampoo in a solid bar. Shampoo bars are not a new idea. They were commonly used before liquid detergent shampoos and conditions were invented in the 1940s. Although the process for making a shampoo bar is the same as making soap, our shampoo bar \"recipes\" are specially formulated with natural plant oils, butters, botanicals and essential oils that nourish your hair and scalp. [](/products/shampoo-bar-carrot-milk-honey/) Our shampoo bars contain no artificial fragrance, color, preservatives, detergents, alcohol, urea, formaldehyde, sodium lauryl sulfate, DEA, propylene glycol - or any of the other synthetic hair care additives. Each of our shampoo bar selections contains a different blend of natural plant oils, essential oils, and herb infused oils. No two recipes are the same. Which Shampoo Bar Is Best For My Hair?

If so, any tips? Conventional shampoos and conditioners, even some that claim to be natural, contain waxes, silicones, or other additives that coat your hair to make it feel smooth. They also contain synthetic detergents which rinse out more easily than a soap-based shampoo bar. Since our natural sulfate-free shampoo bars do not strip hair like detergent-based shampoos, you may notice your hair feels different immediately after washing because your hair is accustomed to the squeaky clean feel of a detergent-based shampoo. Switching from conventional shampoo to a natural shampoo bar may mean a transition or adjustment period. While many folks have little problem with their hair adjusting to a new routine, some do. Since everyone's hair is unique it is difficult to tell you exactly what your transition, if any, will look and feel like. Your hair may feel greasier than normal or it may even feel drier than normal. It may feel waxy, coated, or just weird as your scalp works to re-balance its oil production. The transition period can range from a few days to a few weeks. It really depends on how damaged your hair is, how much residue and build-up is present, your genetics, your water, and even the technique that you use to shampoo your hair. Transition is literally a time for your hair, which has been addicted to chemical-laden shampoos, to go through withdrawal, and learn to live a chemical-free life. We have been making and using natural shampoo bars for over 14 years and have received so many questions. It may take some patience, but if you can persevere, your reward will be healthy, soft, and silky hair.

Do I Need A Vinegar Rinse When Using a Natural Shampoo Bar? Whether or not you need to use an apple cider vinegar (ACV) rinse depends on a number of factors. - Your water: If your hair does not seem to be adjusting to the shampoo bars, it may be due to your water. Hard water makes it more difficult to rinse natural shampoo from your hair. - Hair length: Many of our male customers and women with short hair have found that they do not need to rinse with vinegar, simply because their hair is short. - Tangles: ACV rinses often help with tangles. - Residue: If your hair has residue from previous products or you regularly use conditioners, styling gels etc., our shampoo bars are mild and may not remove residue from your hair like detergent shampoos. ACV rinses help remove build-up and product residue. - Hair type: Everyone's hair is unique. [Check out our selection of ACV Rinses](/collections/natural-hair/apple-cider-vinegar-hair-rinse/) I wish I could use an apple cider vinegar (ACV) rinse very day. Besides creating tangle-free locks, I also love the way it makes my hair look and feel. As I have gotten older my hair has become drier and I can only use an ACV rinse 2 or 3 times week. Blog: [Make Your Own Natural Vinegar Hair Rinse](/blogs/idas-soap-box-blog/make-your-own-apple-cider-vinegar-rinse/) [View Ida's Shampooing Technique for Long Hair Ida's Shampooing Technique for Long Hair Men and women with short hair seldom have hair adjustment problems to natural shampoo bars. However, folks with long hair may have to change their shampoo technique when switching from commercial liquid shampoo or synthetic detergent shampoo bars to natural bars. We have discovered that people with long hair often feel the need to use too much shampoo. Also, it is more difficult to rinse shampoo out of all the little nooks and crannies in long hair. As a result, there are pockets of soap residue left in the hair that make hair feel tacky. I have found that many times the proper technique makes all the difference. I have long, fine hair. Below is my technique for using a shampoo bar. - thoroughly wet my hair - tie my long hair into a loose ponytail - wet the natural shampoo bar and rub the bar across only the top of my head in strokes from front to back until I have covered the entire scalp area (Rubbing any shampoo vigorously in all directions causes lots of tangles!) - massage my entire scalp (only the scalp) in a combing motion to work the lather through my hair - I do not rub the bar or work the lather on the length of my hair - take out my ponytail and rinse allowing the shampoo to drip down the length of my hair (I have found that this rinsing is enough to clean the length of my hair) - rinse, rinse, rinse for at LEAST one minute as I rub my fingers through my hair to be sure that all of the shampoo is rinsed away - squeeze gently on the length to remove excess water and cover with a towel while I dry off - I do not rub the towel over my wet hair because it causes nasty tangles - use a wide toothed comb and gently comb from the bottom up Dry and style your hair as usual! [View Answer Page](/blogs/faq/idas-shampooing-technique-for-long-hair) Do I Still Need To Use Conditioner With A Natural Shampoo Bar? Some folks do, and some don't! For Body & Luster If you are using a conditioner because your hair is dull, lacks luster, and is dry--you may not need a conditioner--that's another plastic bottle saved! Since commercial shampoos contain petroleum products that are actually drying to your hair and scalp, conditioners are usually needed. Our natural shampoo bars will not strip the natural oils from your hair, so you will not need the typical moisturizing conditioners that people use to replace the natural oils stripped by detergent shampoos. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) rinses are an excellent addition to any natural hair care routine and can help bring back body and shine to dull, lackluster hair. For Tangly Hair Hair tangles result when individual hairs go in different directions and intertwine. The outer layer of the hair, the cuticle, is made of overlapping layers of long scales that lie along the surface of the hair like shingles on a roof. The condition of the cuticle scales in part determines whether you are going to have tangly hair. When you shampoo or even wet your hair, the cuticle opens making it prone to tangling. The way you shampoo and your hair type can affect hair tangles. I have long, fine, thin hair that is very prone to tangling. Just imagine all of those little strands of hair as very thin strings\u2014now put little burrs on the strings (the open cuticle) and you can see my problem. When I used a commercial shampoo I would go through a 16-ounce bottle of conditioner every week\u2014just to get a comb through my hair. Using my shampoo bars has made a big difference. I wish I could use an apple cider vinegar (ACV) rinse every day. Besides creating tangle-free locks, I also love the way it makes my hair look and feel. As I have gotten older, my hair has become dryer and I can only use a traditional ACV rinse 2 or 3 times per week. But I keep a spray bottle of very dilute ACV rinse that I use more often. Helpful hint: If I comb through my hair length while it is still lathered and continue to comb as I rinse, the tangles comb out more easily. Some customers have reported that they needed to continue using their traditional conditioner for a while and then were able to slowly wean off of it. I say, whatever works for you!

Although handmade natural soaps usually get better with age, we recommend using our soaps within 12 months of purchase. Our scented soaps should be used within 3 months after removing them from the box. Although the soaps will not be \"spoiled\" after that time, you may notice some changes as natural soap ages. - some natural colors may fade over time - the scents from pure natural essential oil scents will fade over time The changes in color and scent happen even more quickly in our sample size bars. These small natural soap bars have a much greater surface area to volume ratio which allows essential oils to evaporate from the surface more quickly. However, the scent may still be there when you lather up. I have found some ancient bars hiding in my closet that years old. The scents were gone, but the lather was incredible! The Long Answer For a more detailed discussion please read our blog, [\"The Shelf Life, Color & Scent of an All Natural Soap.\" ](/blogs/idas-soap-box-blog/the-shelf-life-color-scent-of-an-all-natural-soap/) How You Can Help Prolong Shelf-Life - Natural soaps need to breathe. Exposure to air promotes hardening of your soap and contributes to longer-lasting quality. Soap should be left unwrapped in their boxes or wrapped with breathable materials. Tight wrappers cause humid conditions by preventing evaporation of moisture. - Our soaps are packaged in breathable, recyclable, sustainable packaging! Keep your natural handmade soaps in a dry, cool place away from sunlight, excessive heat and humidity. - Our scented soaps, like Lavender Rosemary, can be placed in a muslin bag, old clean sock, or wrapped in a piece of cloth and put in your linen closet or dresser drawer to give a delightful fragrance to your linens and clothes while waiting to be used.

Although we get asked this question often, it is a very difficult one to answer, because the bottom line is . . . how old is the bar? Is It freshly cut or has it been allowed to cure? Handmade soap and shampoo bars made using the cold process method and at the end of the soap reaction (saponification), they still contain water. The curing process allows excess water to evaporate. Our freshly cut full-size bars are soft and weigh approximately 6.0 to over 6.5 ounces. These bars will lose approximately 12% of their weight as most of the water evaporates during the first 6 to 8 weeks of curing time. This means that an average fresh bar, at 6.5 ounces will weigh approximately 5.7 ounces after about 8 weeks. At Chagrin Valley Soap, our soap and shampoo bars are cured for about 10 to 12 weeks before selling and moisture will continue to evaporate over time as the bar ages. So, as our soap and shampoo bars sit waiting for a new home they will continue to shrink in size. Some soap makers use the fresh-cut weight on their packaging, but we feel that is an inaccurate description. We use the average weight of our bars after at least a 10 week curing time. While some companies allow their soaps to cure for only 4-weeks, but we know that our longer, slower curing time ensures a milder, harder, longer-lasting bar, with a very rich lather. Some soap companies shrink wrap their soap bars to help prevent continuous shrinkage due to evaporation. We have a few big problems with that idea. First of all, we know that we definitely do not need any more plastic added to our planet. Secondly, although we know there will continue to be a small weight (and scent) loss over time, we prefer that over sacrificing the quality of our soap. Since each of our soap/shampoo recipes is different and the percent of liquid used varies, the amount of water that evaporates over time and the bar size will also vary. The average weight of Chagrin Valley full-size natural soap and shampoo bars is about 5.2 to 5.6 ounces after 10 weeks of curing. The average full-bar dimensions in inches are approximately 3.75 x 3 x 1. Our Mini Bars of Soap and Shampoo (Loofah Foot, Pet Bars & Camping) weigh approximately 3 to 3.6 ounces. Our Natural Soap and Shampoo Trial Size Sample Bars weigh approximately 1.5 to 2 ounces. Summary of the variation in weight - Our soaps are a handmade product - As our curing bars sit and wait for a new home, they will continue to lose water weight and shrink a bit - Since all of our recipes are different, the amount and type of liquid used to make each recipe differ and the more liquid used in the recipe, the more they will shrink as they cure - In Winter the dry heat will often cause bars to shrink a bit more - No plastic wrapping - The good news is that the older bars will last longer and lather even better Compare our bar size! Most handmade soap companies sell full size bars that are about 3.5 to 4.5 ounces. Our customers have told us that they like the larger size bars. When you compare the prices of other soaps, please compare SIZE and ingredients as well! For a great explanation of the process involved in making soap please read our blog, [\"How We "}
