Limited information is available in the public domain for the concept of symbiohealth, i.e., the symbiotic interaction of ayurveda and allopathy, that needs to be explored for an efficient and robust health system. Therefore, an attempt has been made to reduce the toxicity of therapeutic drugs via the integration approach of ayurveda and allopathy. Methods: Three different categories of allopathy and ayurvedic medicines, such as antacids (omeprazole, ranitidine, and sooktybhasma), antibacterial (amoxicillin trihydrate, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, Curcuma longa, and Datura stramonium) and antiviral (acyclovir, efavirenz, Echinacea, Calendula, Allium sativum, and Citrullus colocynthis) were targeted. Results: Best therapeutic hybrid combination was obtained on the basis of their UV absorption maxima and peak shift. Acyclovir with A. sativum (1-6%), sooktybhasma 20% with rantidine, Ciprofloxacin HCl (2%) with 10% aqueous datura and Ciprofloxacin HCl (0.02-0.2%) with 0.02-0.06% acetonitrile turmeric showed best integration result. This drug integration can be applied to improve the potential results or detoxification of hybrid drugs that target the drug moiety results in reduced side effects or the dose of important drugs, which might be due to the chelation pattern of their functional group, absorption, bonding, and pi-pi interaction. Conclusion: This study will provide the leadership for the betterment of a therapeutic hybrid drug complex that might be useful as an allopathic drug and less harmful than its ayurvedic component. The proposed integration fusion of different medication therapies, such as Ayurvedic and allopathic, has the potential for a scientific merger.", "sitename": "http://www.eurekaselect.com", "date": "2023-05-30", "cleaned_text": "Abstract Background & Objective: The treatment of diseases and good health maintenance are the common fundamental aims of ayurvedic and allopathic medical systems.
