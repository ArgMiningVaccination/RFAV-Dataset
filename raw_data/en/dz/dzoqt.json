Primary health care programme managers must therefore use avail-able resources as efficiently and effectively as possible. The optimal use ofresources requires clear and accurate information on resource flow, and on theimpact that resources have on the quality and performance of health services.This manual is designed to provide primary health care programme managerswith guidance on how to use cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis as toolsto achieve better understanding and management of resource flows. A firmunderstanding of these issues at the primary health care level represents animportant step towards more equitable provision of services. The long-termsustainability of primary health care services is also dependent on the compre-hensive application of cost analysis and cost-effectiveness tools and methods.These guidelines are the result of a collaborative effort by three internationalorganizations involved in health development, and are based on experiencegained in a wide range of health programmes. They have been developedthrough a process of workshops and field-testing; it is expected that they willcontinue to evolve as further experience is gained.It is my hope that this manual will gain wide acceptance and application, andthat an improved understanding of cost issues will contribute to strengtheningprimary health care. 4.0Hiroshi Nakajima,Director-GeneralWorld HealthOrganization AcknowledgementsThis manual was developed over a period of three years, through workhops andfield-testing with important inputs from health programme managers in manydeveloping countries. Financial and technical support was provided by theUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Aga Khan Foundation. TheDanish International Development Agency supported many of the workshops.The drafting process involved a team of people with expertise in cost analysis,and in preparation and layout of training materials. Margaret Phillips, LondonSchool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, England, was responsible for the initialdraft; Barbara McPake, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,produced most of the exercises; Charles Thube, East and Southern AfricanManagement Institute, Anisha, United Republic of Tanzania, organized a work-shop to test and review the material; Robert Robertson, Mount Holyoke College,Mount Holyoke, MA, USA, made extensive revisions and produced the presenttext, taking into account the comments of over 30 health managers who tookpart in workshops in Lisbon, Portugal, and Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania.Thanks are due for the patience and cooperation of all of these persons.Acknowledgment is also due to the other principal sources of guidance inhealth programme cost analysis, which have inevitably influenced thinking andpractice in this area. Some of these sources, though by no means all, are listed asfurther reading on page 143. 11 J. Introduction Why study costs?Collection and analysis of data on programme costs can provide considerableuseful information on primary health services of all kinds. In addition toindicating the amount of funds (from all sources) likely to be required to continueprogrammes, they can help you to assess the use of personnel in deliveringprimary health care (PHC) and the efficiency of putting supplies, transportresources and other inputs to work. These results can apply to entire programmesor to specific components of them and to comparisons of specific centres, postsand other units that deliver services. While you and your associates areestimating costs, you will probably also derive additional information of practicalusefor example, vaccine, wastage rates in immunization pro grammes.When cost data can be related to existing or readily available information onprogramme performance, such as coverage of the target population by aprogramme or by a specific delivery site, useful assessments of efficiency in aninput/output sense can be made. Similarly, while examining what you are gettingfor the resources you use, you can often make at least preliminary judgementsabout who is being helped by the health programme, which will tell yousomething about the equity (fairness) of the health scheme.These and other uses of cost data are described in this manual. Trainingexercises are included to provide practice in collecting and interpreting data. Themanual also contains guidelines about the nature of the underlying cost conceptsand the principal ways of measuring them, as well as directions for thearrangement of data and the computations needed to arrive at the necessaryndings. Not all users will need to read the entire contents of the manual. Thus,users interested in identifying and using unit financial costs may focus on Part A.Those interested in questions of cost recovery and sustainability will need toconcentrate on Parts A and C, while those interested in an introduction to cost-effectiveness should focus on Parts A and B. Who will use this manual?While the manual has been prepared primarily for programme managers atnational, regional, and district levels, almost any health professional can learnsomething from it through a short training course or by individual study. Evenstaff at specific delivery units, such as health centres, will find parts of it useful.Levels below the national one are all too often ignored in cost analyses and othereconomic assessments, but district health officers and similar officials are definite-ly among the target users of the manual. The community level is crucial to the E COST ANALYSIS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE management of primary health care programmes. Naturally, higher-levelspecialists, such as health planners who might have prior training in economics,can also put the guidelines to good use. However, no past experience or technicalexpertise in economics is needed.It is likely that, as you study the manual arid its exercises and follow up bydoing some cost studies, your enthusiasm and confidence in examining costs andin using your findings in decision-making will increase steadily. There is a realincentive to do this: the present economic climate has produced a general scarcityof resources for the health sector in many countries, and cost analysis can help tomake the best use of the limited resources available. How this manual is organizedThe manual consists of three parts containing a total of twelve modules. Part Aintroduces you to financial costs and provides a first look at the effectiveness ofhealth services. Part B covers other kinds of costs and compares cost ai.deffectiveness estimates in cost-effectiveness analysis. In Part C, several importantuses of cost and cost-effectiveness data for planning and management arediscussed and illustrated. At the end is a set of exercises to be used with theindividual modules. 13 PART AUnit financial costs ...1V1 0 D1.1 are the costs? Cost classificationTo estimate a health programme's costs, it is necessary to classify its components.Cost elements can be broken down in several ways, as illustrated below. A goodclassification scheme depends on the needs of the particular situation or problem,but there are three essential elements:It must be relevant to the particular situation.The classes (categories) must not overlap:The classes chosen must cover all possibilities.Economists define cost as the value of resources used to produce something,including a specific health service or a set of services (as in a health programme).Resources used for PHC programmes can be described in many different ways.For .!xample, a diarrhoeal diseases control programme might be described asusing the following resources: personnel, money from external sources and massmedia. These categories are well defined and their meaning is clear. However,they do not constitute a very useful way of thinking about the resources used inthis programme. The main problem is that the categories overlap; money fromexternal sources can be used to pay for personnel, and personnel are likely to beinvolved in mass media operations. If we add up the value of these threecategories, they may well come to more than the total cost of the programme.One reason why the categories above are difficult to use is that they confusedifferent dimensions of resources, mixing activities (in this case \"mass media\")with sources (\"money from external sources\") and physical inputs (\"personnel\").Obviously, several different classification schemes are involved here. Theseand others need to be looked at separately, starting with the most basic re-source inputs. Examples of resource inputs include personnel, supplies andequipment. Classification by inputsThis type of classification of costs is useful and widely applicable. It groups inputsinto categories in which the elements have recognizably similar characteristics,for example vehicles, personnel and supplies. If used properly, this scheme hasmany merits, including the following:It involves a manageable number of categories, and these categories aregeneral enough to be applied to any health programme. 1.5 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS It distinguishes two important categories of resources, those that are usedup in the course of a year and are usually purchased regularly (i.e. recurrentcosts) and those that last longer than one year, such as buildings, vehiclesand equipment (i.e. capital costs).It focuses attention on the operating (recurrent) costs of investments invehicles, equipment and buildings by making these into distinct categories.Any classification requires basic definitions and avoidance of confusion. Forexample, more than one word can be used to refer to a single group of resources.\"Manpower\" and \"personnel\" are two such words. Secondly, there are differencesin the degree of detail; \"personnel\" can be further subdivided into doctors, nurses,administrators and technicians. For a practical exercise in identifying resourceinputs, see exercise IA on page 96. Then return to this point in the module.A scheme for classifying costs by inputs (with examples of each category) isshown in the chart below. Classification of costs by inputsCapital costsVehicles: bicycles. motorcycles. four-wheel-drive vehicles, trucksEquipment: refrigerators. sterilizers, manufacturing machinery, scales, otherequipment with a unit cost (price) of $100 or moreBuildings. space: health centres. hospitals, training schools, administrativeoffices. storage facilitiesTraining, nonrecurrent: training activities for health personnel that occuronly once or rarelySocial mobilization. nonrecurrent: social mobilization activities. e.g. promo-tion. publicity campaigns. that occur only once or rarelyRecurrent costsPersonnel (all types). supervisors. health workers administrators. techni-cians. consultants. casual labourSupplies: drugs. vaccines, syringes. small equipment (unit cost of less than$100)Vehicles operation & maii,:i,nancel petrol. diesel. lubricants. tyres. spareparts. registration, insuranceBuildings, operation & maintenance. electricity. water, heating, fuel. tele-phone. telex. insurance. cleaning, painting. repairs to electrical supply.appliances, plumbing. roofing and heatingTraining. recurrent (e.g. short in-service courses)Social mobilization' operating costsOther operating costs not included above To apply the recommended chart of input categories, see exercise I B, page 96.16. MODULE 1: WHAT ARE THE COSTS? Some possible secondary classificationsDescribing the resources used in terms of physical inputs, as we have done above,is one way of dividing them up. However, it is not the only way. Resources haveother characteristics that are important. There are four other characteristics thatyou might find helpful in describing and assessing the costs of your programme.They are usually less important than the inputs scheme, and are explained brieflybelow. Classification by function/activityThe first of the secondary classifications involves the kind of activity or functionfor which the resources are used. A maternal and child health (MCH) programme,for example, encompasses a wide range of activities, such as tetanus toxoidvaccinations for pregnant women, prenatal care, supervision of deliveries, andimmunization and weighing of children. For each of these activities, groups ofphysical inputs are required. For example, infant weighing requires personnel todo the weighing and record the results, scales, tables, charts, building space andpossibly vehicles.To practise using these ideas on functions or activities, see exercise IC,page 97.The activities mentioned above for MCH are a limited set. They include onlythe service provision activities. Did you remember to include in your list theessential activities that support and complement them? Examples that you arelikely to find in most health programmes include:training,supervision,management,monitoring and evaluation,logistics and transport.In most cases, identifying the different functional components is straight-forward. However, it may be easy to miss some functions that are handledseparately from the rest of the programme, either institutionally or financially.For example, the communications aspect of your programme may be funded orimplemented outside the Ministry of Health and could be overlooked: If you arelooking at the whole health sector and not just at single programmes, thefunctional breakdown may be in terms of preventive or curative programmes orby type of institutionhospital, health centre or staff training institution.For PHC, distinguishing among institutions, especially hospitals, is probablyunnecessary.There is one other thing to be careful about when estimating the costs ofmultiple-activity programmes. You will have to allocate resources that are shared 111 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS among the activities so that each is charged only for its proper share. This isespecially important for personnel in some cases. Accounting methods fordealing with such allocations are covered in Module 4. Classification by levelAnother way of dividing up resources is according to the level at which they areused. For most health programmes there is an obvious hierarchy of operations. Ina national programme, for example, some resources are used at the central ornational level while others are used at the provincial, regional or district level.And some are further decentralized to health facilities or to the community,village or household level. You may be responsible for, or involved in, a nationalprogramme at the central level or at any of the other levels. Where several levelsare involved, you must decide for each cost analysis whether you want to classifythe results by level, i.e. according to where the output takes place. Classification by sourceThe source (provider) of the resources is another very important characteristic.Contributors may include the Ministry of Health, other national governmentdepartments, local government bodies, international donors, bilateral donors,independent nongovernmental charitable or private organizations, communitygroups and individuals.You might wish to break down your costs according to source (perhaps tiedto specific activities or inputs) for financial reporting, including reporting todonors, or for predicting calls on national funds in the future. From such data, youcould also estimate the \"multiplier effect\" of external assistance, which showswhether a boost in total health spending is associated with the aid. This kind ofclassification is quite straightforward in principle. Classification by currencyClosely associated with the source of the resources is the type of currencyrequired to purchase those resources. Bilateral and international donors, forexample, very often supply goods and services that need to be purchased inforeign currency (i.e. foreign to the recipient). The distinction between resourcesrequiring domestic currency and those requiring foreign currency is an importantone, particularly in those developing countries where there is a shortage offoreign (or convertible) currency. Donor contributions are a way of easingforeign exchange shortages. However, donors may not be able to continue theirsupport indefinitely, and it is useful to know what foreign currency burden wouldthen fall on the government. 1,8 MODULE 1: WHAT ARE THE COSTS? In a few cost studies, the initial estimates are adjusted to correct anydistortions in exchange rates caused by artificially set official rates. You mightneed a classification of findings by type of currency to make such adjustments,along with some expert advice. See exercise ID, page 98, for more onclassification by type of currency, and see Module 7 for further discussion offoreign exchange.The topic of exchange rates raises a question that goes beyond classifications:when and how should cost values in a local currency be converted to some kindof international medium, such as the United States dollar? For internal uses of costdata, such a conversion should not be necessary, and some countries' studies havebeen left entirely in the national currency. However, if the results of an analysis ofprogramme costs are to be compared with those of programmes in othercountries, conversion tc a common monetary measure will be necessary. Toavoid possible errors from using an official exchange rate, you should consulteconomic special; 'nr officials of other agenciesfor example, the Ministry ofFinance or the cc;dank. ConclusionIf you look at small enough pieces of the resource input picture, it is pwsible todescribe each resource (and to estimate its cost) both in terms of the type(category) of physical input and in terms of any one of four secondaryclassifications, i.e. function or activity, level at which resources are used, source orcontributor, and currency.You should be aware of these distinct features of the resources used in yourprogramme. Avoid mixing different characteristics in the same list, or you mayhave problems deciding how to categorize some resources. For example, if youhave personnel (a physical input) and mass media (an activity) in the same list,where do you classify staff who are involved in mass media activities? The dangeris that you may count things twice, or perhaps even forget them altogether.Sometimes, it may be justifiable to include an activity within a list of inputs. Ifone activity is clearly separate from the others, both financially and adminis-tratively, it may be easier not to attempt to break it down into its componentphysical inputs, but merely to record the total cost. For example, training andsocial mobilization activities are treated above as categories of inputs andincluded along with personnel, vehicles and the like. When this is done, it isassumed that all the resources required for the activity (e.g. personnel andvehicles) are included in that category (e.g training) and not under the separatecategories of personnel, vehicles, and so forth. Thus, the full cost of all inputsused for training is estimated and used as the value for that category.To conclude this module and check your understanding of the main points,see exercises 1E, IF, and 1G, pages 98-101. 10 MODULE '2'Using cost data The introduction to this manual describes some uses of cost information. Thismodule tells you more about the usefulness of the results of cost analyses. As youwill see, they can be helpful in meeting requirements for accountability andjudging (and promoting) programme efficiency as well as achieving other goals. Accountabilitykeeping trackIt should come as no surprise that, as an employee of the government or of anongovernmental organization (NCO), you are accountable to your employers(and they, in turn, are usually accountable to the public) for your expenditure orthe resources you use. To meet the obligations of accountability, you need, at thevery least, to:know how you have spent the finances available to you; andensure that the money you control has been spent as intended.All this might seem like a simple exercise in financial housekeeping, but failureto acknowledge its consequences can have unfortunate results. No one can justassume that budgeted funds have been spent exactlyno more and no lessandthat they have been used properly. Most government and private organizationshave mechanisms to protect their funds from misuse and waste. As well asresponding to questions from higher levels of the administration, you can doseveral useful things at the programme or district level to achieve greateraccountability.Take a moment to consider the kinds of accounting mechanisms that you havein your programme for keeping track of expenditure and minimizing waste andmisuse. Which of these mechanisms appear to work well and which poorly? Nowwe will show you some specific steps to help you to achieve accountability,starting with a look at your budget.At the level of the overall programme, the budget provides guidelines on howresources should be used. The budget is a document which sets out in generalterms how much money should be spent on different inputs or activities. Itdescribes planned expenditure over a defined periodusually one year, some-times longer.Even if you ignore this plan, others will not. Failure to stick reasonably closelyto your budget is likely to cause you considerable problems, If your expenditurebegins to exceed the budget, you will need to look for additional resources. Thiscan be a time-consuming and frustrating task. And if it is not successful, the0 MODULE 2: USING COST DATA effectiveness of your programme may be seriously jeopardized; for example, if amalaria programme cannot afford to buy drugs, it is not likely to be verysuccessful in controlling malaria.You may also have problems if you fail to spend the entire amount budgeted.The Ministry of Finance or other authority that controls budget allocations mayautomatically reduce your future budgets on the assumption that you will beunable to use all the resources you have requested.For all these reasons, it is desirable fel- budget and expenditure to be closelylinked.Itis,therefore, essential to keep track of what you are spendingthroughout the year. If you find that expenditure on a particular item is too slow,or that the budget allowance is being consumed too rapidly, you may be able totake appropriate action early to avoid a major mismatch between budget andexpenditure. You might derive some guidance from past experience. Are yourbudget and expenditure better or more poorly matched now than in previousyears?There are several possible explanations for a mismatch between budget andexpenditure. One is that the budget is poorly prepared: perhaps it reflects aninadequate understanding of the resources required to achieve particular statedobjectives, so that it simply does not allow sufficient resources to achieve them.This may be because the total allocation is inadequate, or because the distributionof allocated resources is wrong (e.g. too much for salaries but not enough forvehicle fuel) and the budget is not flexible enough to be realistic. Either way, themanager is in the impossible situation of attempting to reconcile overambitiousobjectives with inadequate resources. This situation is all too often the manager'sown fault, since he or she usually has the opportunity to comment on, if notdesign, the budget. (Module 10 discusses procedures for preparing a. goodbudget.)Another possible explanation is that the programme itself is being poorlyimplemented: resources are being squandered, used inefficiently, even diverted toother uses. Finally, the mismatch may be due to unexpected changes, such as asudden devaluation of the national currency, a rise in the price of a major input, ora natural disaster.In order to identify possible causes of mismatch between budget andexpenditure, look at your expenditure in detail. First of all, study each majorcategory of input. You might notice, for example, that expenditure on personnelhas been much higher than allowed for in the budget, and realize that this can beattributed to an unexpected increase in wage rates. Or you may note that therehas been underspending on equipment and discover that there have beenproblems with importing particular items of equipment, or perhaps a shortage offoreign exchange. Perhaps you may realize that the amount you allowed for fuelwas inadequate, given the number of vehicles you operate.If your budget is also broken down by functions (activities), you can analyseeach functional budget in the same way. Did any particular function (e.g. training) [13 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS account for the total budget being overspent or underspent? You might alsohave separate budgets for different levels in your programme (national, regional,district), or for each contributor to your programme, or for local and foreigncurrency. You can examine each set of budgets to find out where to focus yourattention when trying to improve the situation next year.In other words, there are many possible steps you can take to interpret asituation in which the budgeted and the actual expenditure are too far apart. Forpractice in interpreting and remedying such a mismatch, see exercise 2A,page 102. Return to this point after completing the exercise. Assessing efficiencyA health programme or service delivery unit is more efficient when it providesmore beneficial effects from the use of a given set of resources. Details of effectsas well as costs are found in later modules. Here, the aim is to allow healthofficials to make some judgements about efficiency by examining fairly simplecost presentations. They are based on \"cost profiles\", which show each input interms of an absolute value and as a percentage of the total cost. (Similar profilesmight break the total down by activity or by level.) An example of a cost profileis shown below. Input category Annual cost(currency)Share 500010Vehicles. & maintenance 500010Buildings, operation & maintenance 10002Training, recurrent 0Social mobilization, recurrent 0Other operating inputs 40008 Subtotal, recurrent 35 00070 Total 50 000100 MODULE 2: USING COST DATA DB You can use cost profiles in two different, but related, ways. Firstly, costprofiles highlight the categories that you should focus on in further studies ofefficiency; the larger the cost category, the more attention it should be given,because the potential for savings is greater. For example, in the above case, if itwere possible to reduce personnel costs by a certain percentage, this would havea much larger impact on total costs than the same percentage reduction in anyother input. A 20% reduction in personnel costs would reduce total costs by 8%(20% of 40%), but the same percentage reduction in vehicles as a capital inputwould reduce total costs by only 2% (20% of 10%). The relative sizes of thecategories might also tell you how much effort to put into estimating their costs.However, you must be careful. The inputs that seem to have the most potentialfor cost reduction are not necessarily those that should be cut. They may be theinputs that are already being used most efficiently, so that cutting back on themmay have a drastic effect on the outputs. Even if they are not being usedefficiently, it may be difficult to change them. For example, salaries may be animportant input and one that is not being used optimally, but altering staffarrangements may be impossible in the short term. Nevertheless, despite thesenecessary qualifications, identifying the major inputs is a useful starting point forexploring the efficiency of a programme.The second way you can use cost profiles is to compare the profiles of similarunits. It can reasonably be assumed that similar units should have similar costprofiles. The units may be different health centres or different geographical areas,such as districts. Major differences in the cost profiles of similar units shouldprompt you to investigate further. Significant differences indicate that there maybe ways of restructuring some units to improve their efficiency. In other words,you need to do further studies to establish the reasons behind any cost profiledifferences before you can draw any firm conclusions about what action might beappropriate.Exercise 2B, page 103, gives you an introduction to the use of comparativecost profiles for districts. After you have done it, return here for some possibleanswers, including policies to promote greater efficiency.One explanation for the differences in spending on drugs by the centres inexercise 2B could b' that the staff of the health centre with a high expenditure ondrugs are overprescribing (prescribing drugs that are unnecessary, or in largerquantities than necessary, or drugs that are more empcn5ive than necessary). Orthis centre may have a high wastage rate because of problems of storage or theft.A look at the drugs inventory, the storage facilities and the treatment records ofthat centre should show you which of these is the problem. Improvements inprescription habits and drug management would be necessary to remedy theseproblems.A second, equally plausible, explanation isthat the difference in drugexpenditure is not the result of inefficiency at the high-expenditure health centre: D UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS the other centres, far from being efficient, may in fact be unable to treat all theirpatients adequately, because of an irregular supply of drugs. Drug inventorychecks would readily establish whether this is the explanation. The appropriateremedy would be to increase the reliability of drug supplies to those centres,which would obviously involve remedial action above the health centre level.A third possible explanation is that there are differences in the pattern ofdisease, or the cost of transporting drugs, or the size of the population servedwhich explain why one health centre has relatively high drug costs. The observedcost differences may thus be justified by the circumstances, in which case theremay be little that can, or should, be done to improve efficiency.This line of analysis points to the need for preparation of cost profiles formany or all of the service delivery units, such as health centres, within a district.Likewise, programme profiles should be drawn up within each district. If aprogramme covers more than one district, a total programme profile will consistof the sum of the relevant programmes in the districts. That probably sounds likea large task, but in fact it should not be too burdensome. The possible benefits inthe form of greater efficiency, and better health of the population, make the effortworth while.Cost analysis to improve efficiency does not stop with the use of profiles. Itwill also be helpful to calculate average (unit) costs, for example, cost per patientvisit to a centre or cost per vaccine dose in an immunization programme. There,too, examination of \"outliers\"that is, the centres with the highest or the lowestcost valuescan lead to useful policies. Later in this manual, you will seeexamples of estimating average costs and of applying the results in practice. Assessing equityEquity means fairness: for instance, equal availability or use of health services foreveryone who needs them. The distribution of health resources is one veryimportant indicator of equity and examination of this is a necessary first steptowards more detailed analysis. If one district receives twice as much of yourprogramme expenditure as another, there might well be a case for better balanceof resources on grounds of equity. Of course, total cost is not a very helpfulguide. One of the major determinants of cost is the number of people served: thedistrict using more resources may simply serve many more people. A bettermeasure is the cost per person (that is, the total cost divided by the number ofpeople in the target population). When analysing the equity of health services,you may need to take into account services provided by other organizations,such as other government programmes, NGOs and other private providers ofprimary care.The comparisons you can usefully make are between people served bydifferent facilities or in different geographical areas. You might wish to focus on24 MODULE 2: USING COST DATA urban vs rural or on income differences, variations in per capita expenditurebetween different ethnic groups or other sectors of the population might also beworth examining in some cases.You can begin to make judgements about the equity of your programme oranother set of PHC activities by doing exercise 2C, page 104. After you havetried that exercise, return here for some possible answers to the last question,concerning differences between districts.If you identify major differences between two districts in the cost per personserved, there are several possible explanations. Suppose that the cost per head indistrict A is much higher than that in district B. It may be that:The authorities are aiming for equity in the nature of the services delivered.To do this they have to spend more per head in district A, because the'highly dispersed population and the rugged terrain there make it moreexpensive to deliver the same level of services as district B is receiving.The authorities are aiming for equity in the nature of the services delivered,but there is much more waste in district A, which makes it more expensive.The authorities are attempting to ensure that both districts have equallygood health. Because the population in district A is less healthy than indistrict B (because of the terrain, the type of employment, genetic factors,the age structure, etc.), it makes more demands on the health facilities andthus requires more services per person.The authorities are trying to guarantee the maximum improvement in healthfrom their investment. They are putting more resources per head intodistrict A, either because it is cheaper to provide services there or becausethe population is less healthy.The authorities are vulnerable to the stronger influence and lobbyingpower of district A.District A is favoured politically and has more healthresources put into it,although there may be no significant differences inpopulation or terrain.Clearly it is important to decide which of these explanations is valid beforeyou take action. Youmight consider that the first three explanations areacceptable, but you would perhaps wish to challenge discrimination on politicalgrounds or because of the difficulty of providing services in some areas.In the final section of thismodule (\"Tables for presenting and analysingexpenditure data\"), there is a suggested layout of a table for arranging data bydistrict to judge geographical equity. Assessing prioritiesAt least in the case of vertical or special-purpose programmes, e.g. the ExpandedProgramme on Immunization (EPI), the value of the resources devoted to a 25 113 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS programme is some measure of the national pr onty accorded to it. You may find it useful to know what is being spent on your programme in comparison with other programmes. Are the results compatible with previously stated priorities? You may be able touse the results to negotiate for further funding. Some of the questions to consider are these:What is government expenditure per person on your programme? How does itcompare with government expenditure per head on other health programmes?Has expenditure per headon your programme increased or decreased since last year? Why?What percentage of totalgovernment health expenditure is directedtowards your programme?Has this been increasingor decreasing over time? (You might needsome help in finding the answers to thesequestions.)The answers to all thesequestions can then be related to the priority that the government claimsto give your programme. Planning documents and policy statements are usefulsources of information about stated priorities. You could also put these questionsto other, nongovernmental contributors to your programme, and use the results to encourage contributors to \"put their money where their mouth is\". Making cost projectionsKnowing what you are spending on your existing programme can also be very important for judging future costs. Expenditure is not a self-contained item; what you spend this year is likely to affect what you will need to spend next year. In particular, expenditureon capital goods generally implies a need for continued funding of the associatedrecurrent costs if the capital item is to be used properly. By studying past relationships between the cost of capitalitems and their associated operating andmaintenance costs, you will be in a better position to estimate the future financial requirements of your programme. You can also useyour experience of what a certain kind of programme actually costs to estimate what a similar programme might cost in the future. Module 10 tellsyou more about these applications, including how to estimate future costs anduse the results. Considering cost recoveryThe cost of a health serviceor programme is one of the pieces of information that must be known if a country is considering introducing user charges (fees imposed on patients or on the agency supporting them) as one of the sources of financing.26 MODULE 1: USING COST DATA The aim might be to recover the cost of drags or (much less likely) of all recurrentinputs, or the full cost of the service. If, for example, you are required to cover alllocal recurrent costs through fees, then the average local recurrent cost per unit ofservice will be a good guide to the price you should set.Especially if the policy-makers of a programme are attempting to recovermore than minor recurrent costs, they will need to consider the effect of user feeson the demand for services. A fall in demand may lead to an increase in averagecost per beneficiary. (Even if the aim is to recover only a small portion of totalcosts, the price charged might affect the quantity of services demanded.)Of course, equity should also be taken into account, in terms of the patients'ability to pay for care. Assessment of this is sometimes a difficult task thatgoes well beyond cost estimation. (There is fu, ther discussion of this point inModule 11.) Tables for presenting and analysing expenditure dataTo summarize and conclude this module, a number of tables and exercises arepresented. The tables are to help you to analyse the costs of your programme,using the results to judge efficiency, equity and priorities, to project costs into thefuture, and to consider cost recovery (Corresponding practical problems arefound in exercise 2D, page 105.) Below each table are some important questionsthat the table should help you to answer.The tables below and the corresponding exercises, when completed for local(community) level PHC activities, will necessarily lack some details available formultiple-level or national programmes. And specific items, such as the sources ofsupport, will be somewhat different. Nevertheless, the general approach toanalysis indicated by the tables can be helpful to local officials as well as to others. 13 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS Table 2.1.

Ea Planning the studyIn Module 1, the cost of a health service is defined as the value of the resourceinputs used to produce that service. Up to this point in the manual, the cost ofan input has been treated as though it were equivalent to the expenditurerequired to put it to use. In practice, expenditure figures may need to beadjusted and supplemented by additional information in order to yield trueeconomic costs (see Module 7). For now, though, the focus continues to be onexpenditure. One point from Module 2 deserves to be repeated here: it ; actualexpenditure and not simply the budgeted (expected or hoped for) value thatcounts as cost.This module provides guidance on planning the scope of the cost study andidentifying sources of information for the data collection phase. Data collection isconsidered further in Module 4, where cost calculations are discussed. Setting the scope of the cost analysisBefore you start measuring costs, you must be quite clear about the scope of theprogramme or set of services that you are costing. A good way to clarify exactlywhat you are intending to cost is to use the classifications presented in Module 1as a checklist. First consider all the functions (activities) involved in yourprogramme, record them, and note any that you intend to exclude. Do the samething with the contributors to your programme and for the different levels atwhich your programme functions. Within the limits defined by the functions,levels and contributors, elaborate on the types of physical input used to producethe services in your programme. You should attempt to specify all inputs,preferably using the categories described in Modules 1 and 2. As a generalpractice, it would also be wise to be as comprehensive as possible in terms offunctions, levels and sources of funds, although for some purposes exclusions willbe appropriate. For example, you may be interested only in the costs incurred bythe government (i.e. a certain contributor) within one district (i.e. a certain level)for the educational component of a nutrition programme (i.e. a particularfunction). This clearly sets the limits of the analysis.Your decision on scope will be governed by the questions you are asking.They, in turn, will be determined by the range of your responsibilities and thecircumstances of the programme. Module 9 gives more details about how todecide what the scope of the cost study should be in order to answer questionsabout cost-effectiveness. 36., O 111 UNIT l'INANCIAL COSTS Deciding on the time periodUsually, you should attempt to measure the costs incurred over one full year.This is likely to be consistent with the records of most types of relevant data,such as expenditure on personnel and services provided. A one -} .ar periodavoids any distortions that might be caused by seasonal effects. Occasionally,limitations of information, e.g. for a new programme, or of study time mightmake it necessary to choose a shorter period. If you study costs for less than oneyear, you will probably need to discuss ways of avoiding serious distortions withother knowledgeable persons.You should choose the most recent year for which cost data are likely to beavailable. If the year chosen is too far in the past, important information maybe lost. If the year is too recent, some routinely collected statistics may not yet beavailable.If you are doing a cost-effectiveness analysis, you also need to be aware ofany limitations on availability of effectiveness data. Usually you would collectcost and effectiveness data for the same period, since the effects recommended formeasurement in Modules 5and 9 follow almost immediately from the input ofresources. (There can be exceptions to that rule.)Sometimes the financial year (the period for which routinely collectedexpenditure data are summarized) is not the same as the calendar year (the periodfor which effectiveness statistics are likely to be aggregated). If this is the case, seewhether it is possible to obtain disaggregated data for each month covering costsor effectiveness, so that you can construct either annual effectiveness data for thefinancial year or expenditure figures for the calendar year. Otherwise, it may benecessary to use cost and effectiveness data from slightly different periods. Selecting a sampleWith a programme that has a large number of dispersed delivery units (such as adistrict-level or national-level PHC programme that operates through manyhealth centres), it may not be possible to do a complete costing. This is certainlytrue if the routinely collected statistics are not adequate and someone has to visiteach unit. Even within one health centre, you may not be able to measure everyinput. For example, it would be practically impossible to record the amount oftime devoted by staff members to a programme by monitoring their movementsevery day of the year. In these situations, it is necessary to choose a sample ofunits from the total population. \"Population\" is a term that statisticians use ingeneral to describe the total of all possible observations. It might include, forexample, days in the year, health centres in the district or potential patients in thetarget group. You must be explicit about the base from which your sample isdrawn. If any units are deliberately excluded from the original population, thenature of and reasons for the exclusion should be stated. MODULE 3: PLANNING THE STUDY There are several ways in which you can make your selection. Usually, intaking a sample, you are not just interested in the particular units you select. Youwish to be able to draw conclusions about the population as a whole. If this is thecase, there are certain rules you must follow. Statisticians have devised manydifferent approaches to satisfy the conditions necessary to allow valid conclu-sions to be drawn about the population from samples. Four of these approachesare described below. For each of them, the size of the sample drawn will influencethe degree to which inevitable statistical variation will affect the confidence to beplaced in the estimate for the whole population. Disregarding expense and otherproblems, the larger the sample, the greater the confidence (i.e. the smaller therange of probable error). Another factor is the extent of variation among units ofthe population; smaller variations permit a smaller sample size. You might wish toconsult a statistician about these matters.One of the customary approaches to selection is random sampling. This is agood technique to use if you can feasibly list (and number) all the elements of theentire population and if there are no subgroups you are particularly interested in.You could, for instance, use it in selecting health centres within a district. Havingdecided on the sample size, you would select the required number of units atrandom from a numbered list, using a table of random numbers.Systematic sampling is a second approach. It is easier to use than simple randomsampling, and is most useful when there are large numbers in the population (say,patients attending a hospital). The procedure is as follows:Obtain a list of all the units (n) (in no systematic order) from which thesample is to be selected.Decide on the size of the sample (s).Calculate the ratio Ids (=k). Select every kth item on the list, starting atany point. For example, say you want a sample of 50 patients (i.e. s = 50)out of 2000 attending the clinic in a year (i.e.n = 2000). Then k= 2000/50 = 40, and you would then select every 40th patient. If s doesnot divide exactly into n, e.g. k = 40.54, then round k up or down to thenearest whole number.If you were interested in the health centre costs of a PHC programme in thecountry as a whole, studying a random (or stratified) sample would probablyrequire a lot of travelling and effort, since these units are likely to be widelydispel seri. An alternative approach is first to select a sample of districts and thento look at the health centre costs only in those districts. This is called clustersampling. It gives less valid results than pure random sampling, but can havemajor logistic advantages. You must first select a random sample to determinethe clusters (in this case, districts) to be studied. Then, in the selected clusters,either select an the units (health centres) or a random sample of them. 30 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS A fourth approach with a formal statistical basis is stratifiet. sampling. You maywish to ensure that you include units with particular characteristics in yoursample (e.g. health centres in both rural and urban areas), so that you can comparethem. To do this, first divide the total population (in this case, all the healthcentres) into subgroups (urban and rural); then take a random or systematicsample or even a clustered sample in each subgroup.While the mathematical merits of the above approaches are well known tospecialists, there are situations when a less formal, but more practical, samplingtechnique might be used, which may be referred to as judgement sampling. In asubstantial number of practical cases, barriers to statistical sampling might exist,for example excessive costs or limited cooperation from staff in specific deliveryunits. When one of these problems occurs, random sampling may not be possible,and you may need to use your own judgement to select a reasonably typicalgroup of units for study. The practical advantages of this method are evident, butthe inability to draw general conclusions about the entire population on a formalstatistical basis is a clear drawback to the use of a judgement sample. It is offeredas a less than ideal, but occasionally practical, approach to the task of choosingyour sample.To test your understanding of some of the points in this section, see exercise3A, page114. Drawing up an itinerary and checklistsUsually it is difficult to get reliable cost data, especially on personnel, buildingsand equipment, without visiting the site where the resources are being used.Most PHC programmes function at many levels, from health centres up tonational headquarters. Some of the data may be centralized, but it is oftennecessary to confirm or elaborate on them by visiting more peripheral levels. Youwill need to prepare an itinerary before you start data collection.In general, it is best to start at the most central level relevant to the activityyou are costing. This would be the national headquarters if you were studyingthe costs of a national PHC programme, or the district headquarters if the districtwere your area of study. For studies within hospitals, or production plants, yourfirst contacts should be the chief administrator and the finance officer. At thislevel you can:Determine the costs incurred by the programme at that level. These willneed to be allocated (distributed) among various levels or delivery units ifthe higher-level resources are shared (the ways of handling allocations areexplained in Module 4)..40 MODULE 3: PLANNING THE STUDY Collect data on costs incurred at lower levels which, if available at thenational level at all, are likely to be of better quality and more rapidlycollected (e.g. vaccine use and prices in the case of an immunizationprogramme).Obtain information about the number and kinds of units performing theprogramme activities, which you will need in order to select a sample, aswell as other information to help you describe the programme.You should then proceed to the next level down (say, the regional headquarters ifyou were studying the costs of a national programme) and collect the same kindof information. Once you have collected all the data from the field, at all levels,you should return to the central level. This is important in order to verify data,seek reactions to your preliminary conclusions and fill in any gaps identified. Theprocedure should be repeated at each level within the programme you arecosting, as far as time allows. For example, in each district you should start at thedistrict office, then visit health centres, and afterwards return to the districtheadquarters.Some costs may be estimated from information collected at more than onelevel. For example, information about the use of staff time is likely to be learnedfrom lower levels, while information about standard salary schedules and fringebenefits for the same staff is usually best obtained at the national level.In the process of data collection, several ground rules should be observed.Three especially important ones are:Collect the information at the highest level at which it is available (if it is ofreasonable quality) to minimize study time and expense.Be careful to avoid counting the same cost element (input) twice (\"double-counting\") when you have obtained data at more than one level (forexample, when staffing or salary figures have been provided at both thedelivery-unit and higher levels).Put your greatest efforts into finding (and using) information on the largestinput categories rather than the smaller, less important categories (such assupplies and building operation in most programmes). The latter can oftenbe handled by rough calculations, perhaps based on rules of thumb, such asassuming operating costs of buildings to be equal to a certain percentage oftheir annual capital costs.For each level, you should draw up a checklist of the information you need tocollect. This is particularly important if returning to collect forgotten data wouldbe difficult. If you do not know in advance where the data can be found, draw upa single comprehensive listthat can be checked at each level. Among otherthings, it should include detailed examples for every category of input in the listand tables shown in Modules 1 and 2.41 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS Locating information sourcesThe type and location of many sources of information needed for cost analysiswill be obvious to you. However, the nature and quality of some other sourcesmay warrant a brief explanation here. You will no doubt be able to draw on theassistance of other health officials and on your own experience to supplement theinformation given here.The first step in estimating the financial cost of your programme is to consultexisting records of expenditure or accounts that document actual spending, ratherthan budget records that refer only 1.o planned expenditure. Expenditure recordsare normally compiled and available centrallyat the district, regional ornational leveland provide a convenient source of data. Some data will be foundonly at lower levels, perhaps even at the delivery units themselves.Unfortunately, existing expenditure records are often unsatisfactory for someor all of the following reasons:Records are often compiled some time after the actual expenditure, or arenot compiled at all, because they can be difficult and costly to maintain,especially at the lower levels. They may not clearly separate expenditureunder different programmes, and may not be coded accurately by categoryof input. The groups of inputs may not be the ones you need; for example,there may be a single category \"fuel\" when you would like to distinguishfuel for vehicles from fuel for other purposes.Certain inputs pose special problems because an excessive volume ofrecords is kept on them for fiscal accountability purposes (this is especiallytrue of drugs).An information system that depends on passing data down from higher tolower levels initially and back up to the higher ones again for finalreporting inevitably creates errors.Despite these potential limitations, you have no alternative but to use theserecords for expenditure and other data needed in cost studies. It is possible toimprove the design of some records and to make reasonably simple checks oftheir general accuracy. For further consideration of expenditure records, seeexercise 3B, page114.If expenditure records are not gathered routinely in a format that is useful foranalysis, you will need to collect some additional data. This generally meansfinding out the quantities of resources purchased and the prices paid for them. Forexample, if you wish to know the expenditure of an immunization programmeon syringes, but the expenditure records do not provide sufficient detail youwill need to find out the number of syringes used during the year (say,50 000)and the price of each (say, $0.20) in order to derive the total cost of syringes(50 000 x 0.20 = $10 000).42 MODULE 3: PLANNING THE STUDY Generally speaking, much better recordsfor example, reports of physicalinventoriesare kept of capital items (which are more expensive) than ofrecurrent items. Expenditure records will usually indicate purchases of vehiclesand equipment, and perhaps buildings. Buildings pose problems, though, becauseof the difference between original and replacement costs and the significance ofinflation; in fact, their costs are often better estimated by their rental value, asexplained in Module4.You may need to supplement your reading of ex-penditure records by interviewing staff to obtain enough details about items thatwere purchased specifically for your programme. You may also need to consultpurchasing orders and inventories. The ways in which information on capitalinputs as well as recurrent ones can be used in cost calculations are explained inModule4. MOPU.L.ECalculating costs Module 3 described briefly how to collect information on resource inputs to ahealth programme or a specific service. When recording data needed forcalculation of costs, you should consider the following:If you believe that most of the cost values you have obtained are quiteaccurate, specify data to the smallest monetary unit (e.g. $0.01) and do notround to a larger unit (e.g. $1) until the costs have been added together.This process helps to minimize rounding error.Do as much as possible of the calculation and summarizing as you goalong. In this way, you may be able to detect inconsistencies and oddresults in time to check the information at its source.Note the source of each type of data as you collect it. A \"source\" note canbe put at the bottom of a table or in some other place where it can be easilyseen.When you are doing cost calculations, your basic aim should be to identify allthe inputs to the health care process and to quantify them in order to attachmonetary values to them. In this module, we present basic ideas and methods forcost estimation and explain some additional steps that are generally recommen-ded in order to obtain the real cost of a programme.When you are making calculations, just as when you are collecting the datafor them, try to distribute your efforts roughly in accordance with the relativeimportance of each cost category. For example, personnel costs are bound to berelatively large, so you should take particular care in their computation. For manyprogrammes, less effort should be directed towards supplies and certain othercategories identified below because of their relative unimportance to the totalcost picture. The activities most needed for cost calculations will become.cleareras each category of input is reviewed. Capital (nonrecurrent) resource inputsCapital goods are defined as inputs that last for more than one year. If youstudied expenditure only in one particular year, you could easily get a distortedview of long-term average annual costs. For example, a great deal of equipmentmight have been purchased in the year before your study, with no expenditure oncapital at all during the study period. One way to get an idea of long-termfinancial commitments is to: MODULE 4: CALCULATING COSTS ea identify all the capital goods (vehicles, equipment, buildings, etc.) beingused in that year;find out the current (replacement) cost of purchasing them (C);estimate the total number of years each is likely to last from when it waspurchased (N) (the \"working life\" or \"useful life\");estimate the average annual cost of each capital item in terms of a simple\"straight line\" depreciation (C/N). A refinement of this approach favouredby economists is shown in Module 7. VehiclesThe kinds of vehicles you may need to value include bicycles, motorcycles, four-wheel-drive vehicles, cars and trucks. Costs to be includedUse the current cost for a simlar vehicle, not the original purchase price. The costshould include freight. Sources of cost dataRecent government contracts, supply records from donors, or local dealerestimates are useful source; of information. Working lifeThe working life of a vehicle will vary considerably, depending on vehicle type,terrain, use and maintenance. Consequently, you should try to obtain a localconsensus on the expected working life of each type of vehicle. Ask severalpeople who use, drive or service cars for an estimate of how long this type ofvehicle has lasted in the past (i.e. how long before the vehicle reached a stagewhere it was not worth repairing). For consistency, it is best to use the same timeperiod (e.g. three or five years) for a given type of vehicle for the entire analysis,unless there are major differences in terrain, etc., that would justify the use ofdifferent figures.In the unlikely event that some of the data described above are not available, arough approximation to annual vehicle capital costs can be obtained from localrates for hiring vehicles. In such a case, the cost of vehicles looks like a recurrent,rather than a capital, item, but it should still be considered a capital cost. EquipmentThe kinds of equipment you may need to value include refrigerators, cold boxes,sterilizers, scales, insecticide sprayers and pumps. Use a reasonable figure for thecut-off point between supplies that last one year or more and genuine capitalequipmentsay, a unit price of $100.41 ria UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS Costs to be includedUse the current cost for a similar piece of equipment, not the original purchaseprice. The cost should include freight. Sources of cost dataRecent government contracts, supply records from donors, or local dealerestimates are useful sources of information. Working lifeThe working life of a piece of equipment can be ascertained by asking individualswho operate it how long this type of equipment generally lasts before it isbeyond repair. Buildings: spaceThe kinds of buildings you may need to value include health centres, hospitals,offices, staff houses and warehouses. Costs to be includedYou need to use the current cost of site development, architects' fees, construc-tion costs and the cost of the landi.e. how much it would cost to build thebuilding now.If the total cost is not available, you may be able to obtain estimates of thecost per unit area (e.g. per square metre) for the category of building you areinterested in. You need to take into account factors that may influence thoseestimates, such as the distance from the capital city or the nature of the terrain, aswell as the nature of the structure (e.g. building materials and number of storeys).The cost of basic furnishings and built-in equipment should also be included. Ifit is impossible to itemize these separately, you could consider adding 10% to thetotal cost. Sources of cost dataRecent government contracts for similar buildings are a useful source ofinformation. The planning or tendering section of the health department, orarchitects in the Ministry of Works, or local construction firms should have thisinformation. Quantity surveyors (if they exist in your country) can be helpful,too. Working lifeYou should use 20 years as the expected working life of most buildings, unlessthey arc very temporary structures with much shorten expected lives, or generalpast experience in your area clearly indicates a longer period. 4.6 MODULE 4: CALCULATING COSTS 0 The annual cost of building space can be estimated using an approach that willoften be simpler to apply than the method described above. It consists ofobtaining an estimate of the annual price charged for renting similar space. Theestimate should distinguish between furnished and unfu -nished buildings andbetween air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned space. In effect, this approachtreats buildings as recurrent, instead of capital, inputs. (In that sense, it is similarto the approximation given earlier for vehicles.) You will probably need theassistance of a real-estate agent or someone else who is familiar with the rentalmarket in your area.In view of the relatively small value of building space in the total annual costof a health programme, you will not need an accurate estimate for identical space.Even an approximation is likely to yield a cost estimate that is as accurate as onederived by applying the first, more complicated method (with its inevitableuncertainties regarding construction costs and years of useful life), especially forPHC programmes without hospitals. Other capital inputsFor some programmes, at least at certain levels (usually the higher ones) of ahealth system, there will be relevant training and perhaps social mobilizationactivities. Some of these might he once-only, start-up activities, which constitutenonrecurrent (capital) inputs; others will be recurrent. In both cases, costestimation is greatly simplified by adding up all the cost elements of a training orsocial mobilization programme (personnel, supplies, buildings, vehicles, etc.) andtreating the cost as a lump sum.If that cost total is for nonrecurrent activities (e.g. an initial staff trainingprogramme that will not be repeated), the same approach to annual costingshould be used as for other capital items: divide the total cost by the estimatednumber of years of life (that is, the average number of years for which it affectsthe staff of your programme). For these categories of nonrecurrent inputs, as forothers, the depreciation method of estimating annual costs can be modified togive more accurate economic estimates by the method described in Module 7. Recurrent resource inputsPersonnelSalaries, wages, and other expenses associated with personnel are frequently thesingle largest cost item in health programmes: You should therefore take greatcare in estimating their value. In most cases, you will be interested in both thestaff directly involved in the activity you are concerned with (e.g. nurses, healthaides, trainers, supervisors) and other support staff (e.g. managers, cleaners,guards, drivers). Naturally, you will only want to deal with the costs of the47 El3 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS persons whose time, in whole or in part, is assigned to your programme (see\"Allocating shared inputs\", page 41). Costs to be IncludedThe full cost of employing someone is represented by the individual's grossearningsthat is, the take-home pay plus any additional benefits, such ascontributions to health insurance, social security, and pension plans, and plus tax.These gross earnings should include any incentive payments, overtime, hardshipbonuses, holiday and sick pay, and allowances for uniform, housing and travel. Ifthe worker receives any additional commodities, housing or other nonmonetarybenefits, the value of these should also be estimated, using the prevailing prices ofsimilar items (e.g. the current market rent for similar housing).Fees or honoraria for the short-term services of experts, advisers and othersinvolved in the activity who are not employees should also be included. Sources of cost dataExpenditure records and payrolls in the Ministry of Health will have cost data onsalaries and allowances. You may need to look elsewhere for some data. Forexample, pensions may be paid by the Civil Service Board or another agency, andper diem allowances are often paid by external agencies. Data from the privatemarket can help in the valuation of nonmonetary benefits, such as housing.If you need to identify the earnings of particular individuals, ask for theirsalary grade rather than their actual salary. People are usually more reluctant toreveal their earnings than to state their position on a standard salary scale.Furthermore, it may be tifficult to decide what the figure you are given means(gross or net salary, for example). Salary schedules can usually be obtained fromthe agency administering the civil service. Each type of information will need tobe collected from the most appropriate level.If you ask only about salary grades, you will not get information about otherallowances and bonuses. A rough estimate could be made by assuming that theaverage ratio between salaries and allowances for the whole institution (or arelevant subgroup) can be applied to each individual. For example, you may findfrom district-level expenditure data that allowances are, on average, about 12% ofsalaries. You would then add an extra 12% to each individual's salary.For practice in calculating personnel costs, see exercise 4A, page 116. SuppliesThis category is for materials used up in the course of the year, as direct inputsto the principal activities performed by the programme, and other small itemspurchased during the year. For example, for a disease control programme it couldinclude such things as drugs, reagents for tests, insecticides for vector control, MODULE 4: CALCULATING COSTS needles, slides and stationery. For an immunization programme, it would includevaccines, needles, syringes, cotton wool and surgical spirit, among other things.Although supplies will be a fairly big cost category for both the programmesmentioned, it will be relatively small for some other PHC activities and so willnot justify a large effort. As already stated (page 33), you will need to establish acut-off value that marks the boundary between supplies and equipment. Forexample, if the unit price of an item is less than $100 (or some other value thatyou set), even if it lasts for longer than one year, it will be simpler to consider it inthe recurrent input category of supplies and count in full any such itemspurchased during the year. If the price of the item is $100 or higher, then thecapital categoryequipmentwill be more appropriate. You might wish todistinguish between supplies acquired with local currency and supplies requiringforeign exchange. The general data handling process will be similar.In some instances, it will be useful to identify separately, and summarize,major supply categories or categories of particular interest (i.e. calculate subtotalsfor drugs, stationery, vaccines, etc.). Costs to be IncludedThe full cost of supplies should include the cost of transport to the point of use(i.e. any freight charges for import of materials and any internal distributioncosts). The cost should be that of all the material consumed, including any that islost or wasted as well as that which is actually used for its intended purpose.Losses can result from misplaced shipments, damage (e.g. from water or rodents),pilfering and materials becoming out of date. This loss has to be paid for by theprogramme, and should be included in the estimates.Supplies to be costed do not include those that are distributed but kept in shore(as inventory stocks). Only those that are consumed should be counted. Sources of cost dataUnless expenditure records are very detailed, they are unlikely to be useful forestimating the costs of most of the materials specific to your programme. Instead,ou will need information on quantities and prices. QuantitiesFor many supplies, there will be stores at different levels (national, regional,health centres), which will usually have their own inventory records. Thequantity distributed from these stores during the year will be equal to theinventory at the beginning of the year plus the quantity received during the yearless the inventory at the end of the year.The amount distributed is not necessarily the amount consumed: commoditiesmay be stored at a lower level. Only at the lowest level of the distributionsystem, such as the health centre, are supplies dispensed the same as supplies49 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS consumed. However, if you measure consumption only at the peripheral level,you will fail to take into account the wastage that has occurred between there andthe point of original purchase.You can calculate losses in the system by looking at each level and comparing\"original stock + quantity received\" with \"final stock + quantity distributed\".The difference reflects the amount lost at that level. This process can be refinedby replacing \"quantity distributed\" by \"quantity received by lower-level units\";the difference between these two values measures losses in transit betweendistribution points. This is a potentially complicated exercise, and it may benecessary to use rough approximations of the loss in the system; avoid spendingtoo much time on this point.Alternatively, if the flow of supplies is fairly steady, then the amount ofsupplies distributed from the higher-level unit may be a reasonably goodapproximation of the amount consumed at the peripheral units. This is a validapproximation only if peripheral units are not building up or running downstocks.It is often possible to calculate the amount of supplies that should have beenconsumed on the basis of output. For example, if you know the number ofchildren vaccinated against tuberculosis, you could calculate the amount of BCGvaccine that should have been used. This method is recommended only if data onwastage are readily available; as far as possible, local data should be used inpreference to national averages. PricesSupply invoices, order forms, price lists and catalogues are sources of informationabout purchase prices or replacement prices. Costs of international and internaltransport should be included. International freight costs can usually be readilydetermined (supply invoices and order forms should include them) and shouldnot be overlooked, since they often add a further 10-20% to the original price. Itmay be more difficult to estimate internal transport costs; in fact, if supplies aretransported by vehicles belonging to the programme, the costs will be included inthe vehicle running costs and should not be included here.Exercise 4B, page 117, contains questions to help you to apply some of theabove observations on the cost of supplies. Vehicles: operation and maintenanceMany health programmes rely on vehicles to distribute supplies, permit coordina-tion and supervision, and otherwise implement the provision of care. All toooften, transport is a weak link; vehicles are available but fail to operate efficientlybecause of a lack of fuel or spare parts. It is important to know what it costs to5, 0 MODULE 4: CALCULATING COSTS operate and maintain vehicles. Unfortunately, these costs are among the mostdifficult to measure. You will need to be persistent arid imaginative in your effortsto collect such data. Fortunately, there are some ways of approximating the costswhen the preferred sources are not helpful. Costs to be includedThe costs of operating, maintaining and repairing vehicles should all be meas-ured. TI-.?se will include materials, such as fuel,lubricants, insurance andregistration fees, tyres, batteries and spare parts. The cost of drivers should berecorded under personnel. If a mechanic is assigned to the programme, the costwill also be included under personnel. However, where repairs and maintenanceare contracted out, orwhere they ar' performed by a different office or agency,their cost should be included under vehicle operating costs (i.e. you should makean estimate of total repair costs, including an allowance for the mechanic's salary,rather than including the salary under personnel costs). Sources of cost dataExpenditure records may give some indication of the cost of operating andmaintaining vehicles, but it is likely that you will need to interview drivers andmechanics and consult logbooks to get a sufficiently detailed picture.Fuel consumption is one input for which records are probably reasonablygood. If not, you should be able to estimate fuel consumption based on themileage of the vehicle. Logbooks should indicate distance travelled (say 5000kilometres), and drivers should be able to tell you the average distance travelledper litre of fuel consumedfor that particular type of car in the prevailingconditions (say 10 km per litre). Total consumption is then 5000/10 = 500 litres.The price paid per litre for fuel multiplied by the number of litres used gives thetotal cost of the fuel (even if it is merely charged to a government account).If logbooks and other information sources are not adequate for the calcu-lations suggested (which is all too often the case), alternative data sources canprobably be employed. For example, your ministry's central motor pool person-nel may be able to give you a rough estimate of the total annual cost of operatingand maintaining each type of vehicle. With information on the vehicles used (andthe fraction of their time devoted to your programme) you can make a \"roughand ready\" calculation that will suffice.Oil and filter changes and other maintenance may be done irregularly or on aroutine basis, either after a set number of kilometres or at regular time intervals(e.g. once a year). If you are unable to calculate these inputs in the same way asfuel, you could simply increase fuel costs by a set percentage (e.g. 15%) to allowfor them. Again, the central motor pool may help you with this.Questions and answers concerning some aspects of operation and mainten-ance costs ofvehicles can be found in exercise 4C, page 118. UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS Buildings: operation and maintenanceThis category of inputs is quite easily handled. Although observers are some-times concerned with such costs as utility expenses, these do not form a largeproportion of the total. If the approach below does not readily yield results (withlittle effort on your part), it should be replaced by a simple approximation: justdraw on your past experience (and perhaps other expert opinions) to obtain arough estimate for the total cost of building operation and maintenance as aproportion of their annual capital cost or the annual market rent for that amountof space. Multiply the annual capital cost recorded under \"Buildings, space\" by that percentage to obtain the desired recurrent cost value.Costs to be IncludedOperation and maintenance costs for buildings should include charges forlighting, water, telephones, heating, insurance, cleaning materials, painting, andrepairs to plumbing, roofing, heating and office furniture. As previously noted,the salaries of guards, cleaners, etc. should be counted under personnel.Sources of cost dataThis is one category where recorded expenditure data are sometimes quiteadequate. Recurrent costs for buildings will normally be listed under such headings as \"utilities\", \"maintenance\" or \"cleaning\", and \"security\".Training and social mobilizationOn page 35, it was recommended that all the inputs to training and socialmobilization programmes should be added together to give a single figure, ratherthan including them under separate headings (personnel, buildings, etc.). Each ofthese input categories has its recurrent counterpart, when activities are repeatedperiodically. The sum of these activities over one year is a recurrent cost of theprogramme.There are probably no special problems involved, or instructions needed, forcalculating the costs of these two categories of inputs. If a training or socialmobilization programme serves more than one PHC programme, the total costshould be distributed among those served, as described on page41.Other operating inputsThis is, of course, the residual category, which covers all recurrent input costs notdealt with elsewhere. It will consist at most of a few relatively small cost elementsnot requiring great efforts of calculation. Most PHC programmes and theirservice delivery units, such as health centres, will not incur enough equipment-related recurrent costs to be worth identifying separately, but for the fewexceptions you should use the following estimation method. MODULE 4: CALCULATING COSTS Costs to be includedRecurrent equipment costs include fuel (e.g. kerosene for cold-chain refrigerators)or electricity operating costs (but only if these are not included under buildingsoperation and maintenance), as well as the cost of spares for maintenance andrepairs. Other categories might include postage, printing, photocopying and thecosts of operating and maintaining equipment, but not stationery which iscounted under supplies. Sources of cost dataExpenditure records may contain some data, but they are unlikely to be detailedenough. For a piece of electrically operated equipment you will need to know itspower requirements (the number of kilowatt-hours), the length of time it isoperated over the year, and the cost per unit of electricity. You will probablyneed to ask the people directly responsible for the equipment about the kind ofmaintenance and repairs that were necessary and what spare parts were needed.There are a variety of \"rules of thumb\" to estimate the likely operating andmaintenance costs of equipment used in health programmes. Most of these rulesrelate recurrent costs to the original capital expenditure. The specific relationshipswill depend on the price structure in the country, the nature of the equipment,and so forth. You should explore the precise cost relationships in your ownsituation rather than relying on approximations from elsewhere. Allocating shared inputsIf a particular input is used only for the PHC programme you are studying, thenthe entire cost of it can be assigned to that programme. However, often people,buildings, vehicles, social mobilization and supplies are used for many tasks, onlysome of which serve your programme. And within the programme there will be avariety of services that depend on shared inputs, such as the staff members whoprovide various types of care.In some cases, the term \"shared resources\" simply means that the same typesof input are used for different programmes or activities. For example, a particulartype of drug may be used by two different disease control programmes. Theremay be practical difficulties in deciding how much of the drug was used for each,but there is no problem in theory. If your programme (and the underlyingdisease) did not exist, less of the drug would be required, and it is the value of thisamount that represents the drug cost of the programme. You will need toexamine the records showing the quantities of the drug used and the prices paidfor it.The situation is rather more difficult when a discrete input that cannot be splitinto smaller components (e.g. a person or vehicle) is shared. Depending on thekind of analysis you wish to do, it may not always be necessary to measure inputs UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS that are shared with other programmes. Suppose, for example, that you wantedto know the finances required for the first few years of a programme. Theprogramme may be so small that it can be accommodated in existing buildingsand use existing vehicles. Since these resources would be paid for even if the newprogramme were not implemented, it would not be appropriate to include themin estimates of the additional finance required. In that respect, there is noincremental cost of buildings and vehicles for the new programme.Unfortunately, this rarely happens. It is often difficult to relate general healthadministration and management, for instance, to separate programmes. This doesnot mean that additional programmes can be taken on without, increasingmanagement and administrative capacities. Unless a new programme is verysmall, any extra capacity (e.g. spare time or space) that might have existed in thehealth system will quickly be used up and additional resources will be required.Thus, any new scheme is likely to involve incremental costs.You therefore need to find a. reasonably accurate way of dividing the costs ofshared resources among various user programmes. This process is called costallocation. Its importanceand difficultywill vary among programmes andlevels of service.It is helpful to start by thinking about the particular components of thevarious inputs that determine costs. The table below lists for each type ofresource the component that most directly determines the cost. Input Component that determines cost VehiclesEquipmentBuilding spacePersonnelSuppliesVehicle operation use these components directly as the basis for allocatingcosts. So, for personnel, you should measure the time that they devote to yourprogramme; for a shared vehicle, you should measure the distance travelled orthe time used for duties related to your programme. Similar approaches apply toother categories of shared resources. In some cases, this is relatively straight-forward: for example, staff may have specific periods of the day or week whichthey devote to the immunization programme, or particular rooms in a buildingmay be used for immunization. In other cases, allocation is less simple.It is especially important to get an accurate measure of the proportion of timethat staff members spend on the activities you are interested in. The reason for MODULE 4: CALCULATING COSTS 0 this, apart from the basic importance of personnel costs, is that this proportion isoften used to allocate other shared costs. For example, if you cannot measure theproportion of vehicle costs that should be allocated to the immunizationprogramme, you can use the proportion of staff time devoted to the programmeas a way of allocating the value of shared vehicle costs. If half the staff timeduring a particular session is devoted to immunization, it is reasonable to assumethat half the transport is, too.In many cases, it is not easy to measure staff time. Immunization, for instance,may be done as part of general well-baby clinics, with staff in any one sessionhandling a number of different activities. There are some highly accurate, but notnecessarily practicable, ways of measuring time. For example, because it is riskyto rely on staff members' memories of how they distributed their time when youinterview them later, you can:Arrange for staff to fill out time sheets routinely or over a certain period oftime (this procedure requires supervision to be reliable);Directly observe staff on a random sample of days, recording what they doevery half -hour. This procedure entails considerable expense and effort,and is rarely feasible.The above procedures are often impractical, so it is necessary, instead, to useproxiesvariables that you expect to be closely related to the direct determi-nants of cost. A useful proxy for allocating personnel costs is the proportion ofvisits or contacts that are made for a particular function. For example, you couldassume that the proportion of time spent by staff on treating acute respiratoryinfections is the same as the proportion of health centre visits made for suchinfections. The assumption is that time and visits increase in the same way. Toestimate the recurrent costs of vehicles used for a maternal and child healthprogramme in the absence of records of distance travelled, you could look at thetime the vehicle is used for your activity, assuming that each trip is for adesignated programme. The assumption is that time and distance are closelyrelated.If you are not measuring the factor that directly determines costs, but arerelying on a proxy, you should be aware of the assumptions that underlie yourchoice of proxy. If these assumptions are not true, the proxy may not be accurate.For example, allocating salaries according to the proportion of visits for acuterespiratory infections assumes that a visit for such an infection requires the sameamount of time as a visit for other illnesses and takes no account of a patient withmore than one complaint. If there is no reasonable proxy and none of the moreaccurate methods is feasible, you might have to make some kind of directmeasurement. Usually, though, you can find some way of achieving your aimswith a reasonable margin of error without resorting to that. Assuming that thenecessary information is available, exercise 4D, page 119, provides an illustrationof allocations.rJ 44 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS MODULE 5Measuring effectiveness In previous modules, some of the uses to which cost information can be put wereidentified. One of the applications mentioned was efficiency. This takes intoaccount the benefits of an activity as well as its costs, and weighs up the \"pros\"and \"cons\".Many different terms are used to describe the \"other side of the coin\" of anactivity or programme. We may refer to consequences, outcomes, outputs,benefits, results, impact or effects. These terms are similar, but they cannot all beused interchangeably. A n ajor distinction in economic language is between\"benefits\" which, strictly speaking, refer only to outcomes that can be measuredin terms of money, and \"effectiveness\" or \"effects\", which are outcomes that arenot expressed in financial terms, such as the number of lives saved by a healthintervention.Because of the difficulty of defining all the important outcomes of healthprogrammes in money terms (how do you value life?), this manual focuses oneffectiveness rather than benefits. Effectiveness is a measure of the extent towhich objectives are achieved. Most PHC programmes have as their ultimateobjective an improvement in the health status of the populations they serve, e.g.a reduced incidence of immunizable diseases or an improvement in the health ofmothers and children.Module 9 shows how costs and effectiveness can be combined to derive ameasure of efficiency; this is cost-effectiveness analysis. For now, it is sufficientfor you to think about efficiency in terms of cost divided by effectiveness, such asthe cost per life saved by a programme:costnumber of lives saved Choosing an indicator of effectivenessThere are a number of indicators or measures of effectiveness that reflectintermediate changes rather than final outcomes. For example, before a nutritioneducation programme can be successful in reducing malnutrition and mortality,the educational message must reach the communities; these communities mustthen respond by changing the type of foods they cat or the way they preparefood. These intermediate outcomes, such as the number of people exposed to themessage or the number changing their behaviour, can serve as partial measures ofeffectiveness. Their chief advantage is the relative ease with which they can be 5.6 MODULE 5: MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS m measured and interpreted. Even when the final health status data are not available, these intermediatemeasures can usually give some indication of the results.To give an example basedon an oral rehydration programme: the use of inputs (e.g. staff and oralrehydration salts (ORS)) indicates the provision of services (e.g. delivery of ORS packets and guidance on how and why to use them) that have intermediate effects (e.g. improved knowledge and attitudes causing mothers to use ORS for their children), which in turn produce long-term effects on health status (e.g.a decline in mortality among children under five).Without doing a full-scale exercise now, take a few minutes to list for yourself the answers to the following key questions about the effects of your health programme:What are the main objectives of your programme?Which of these objectives,or which combination of them, can be expressedin terms of a single indicator of health status?What are three important intermediate outputs of your programme?When you do a cost-effectiveness analysis, you will be comparing at least two thingsfor instance, twoways of organizing your programme or activity, or two different sets of inputs to your programme. Ideally, you should choose a measure of effectiveness that captures all the important differences between the alternatives that you are comparing. For example, say youare comparing two different messages used in the mass media to promote contraceptive use. The number of people exposed to each message is not a satisfactory outcome measure to use in this case, since merely hearing a message does not guarantee that the hearer will change behaviour and the different messages are likelyto have different effects on contraceptive use. You would really need to measure changes in the rate of contraceptive use.On the other hand, ifone alternative was to broadcast a given message at six o'clock in the evening and the other was to broadcast the same message at eight o'clock in the evening, the number of people in the targetgroup exposed to the message is quite an appropriate measure. If you were comparing two completely different contraceptive methods, then neither the numbers exposedto the message nor the use of contraceptives would be adequate: it would be necessary to use a measure of impact, such as months of effective birth control or even the birth rate (though the latter will be affected only overa long period of time). Usually, the greater the difference in the alternatives you are comparing, the more likely it is that you will need a measure of changes in health status, rather than changes in the output of goods and services, ifyou want to compare their outcomes.At the same time, you should be aware that the further you move away from immediate outputs and the closer you get to health impact, the harder it will be to UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS make the measurements. Measuring changes in health status is a difficult andexpensive task. It often involves establishing baseline surveys and follow-upsurveys, collectingdata on a number of variables, and surveying large popula-tions. Even if you do successfully measure a change, it is likely to be quite difficultto demonstrate what caused it and, in particular, how much of the change wasdue to the intervention you are interested in. Measures of effects onbehaviour orknowledge pose similar, though perhaps less severe, difficulties.For these reasons, it is recommended that you focus on service outputs as youreffectiveness measures (e.g. number of children immunized, number of contra-ceptives distributed, number of treatments provided). These data are oftencollected routinely and are usually available in existing records. Then, wherepossible, you can move on to examine effects on health status.Comparisons involving more than one measure of effectiveness are con-siderably more difficult to interpret. However, sometimes it is difficult to identify(or to measure) a single outcome variable that satisfactorily embodies all thedifferences between the options you are considering. In this case, you couldchoose more than one. For example, say you were comparing two differentstaffing structures for your health facilities; you might decide that you want toknow how these compare in terms of number of immunizations, prenatal sessionsand home visits.For practice in dealing with some of the issues discussed above, see exercise5A, page122. Judging the merits of measures of effectivenessThere are many things to consider in assessing the merits or adequacy of anypotential measure of effectiveness. Several important considerations are pre-sented below. Is the effectiveness measurecomparable between alternatives?Ideally, you need to choose an outcome measure that means the same thing forall the interventions you are comparing. In other words, you want an outcomemeasure whose numericalvalue will reflect the difference between the alter-natives. It is not very helpful to use an outcome measure which is different inquality for the alternatives you are examining, particularly if these have differentimplications for health impact.For example, the outcome\"number of births attended\" could have verydifferent implications for health impact if one option involves doctors in ahospital setting and the other traditional birth attendants in a village. Apreliminary assessment of relative knowledge and skills from a sample of the twogroups would give you some clues to decide whether the consequences for health MODULE 5: MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS co are likely to be similar. These data on quality will indicate whether the linkbetween the intermediate outcome you have chosen and the health impact islikely to be the same for each of the options. If there is little difference in quality,then thereis no problem with using \"number of births attended\". If thedifferences appear to be significant, you could:choose an outcome measure closer to the health impact end of thespectrum (e.g. perinatal mortality); .orredefine your outcome measure so that it includes some of the qualitydimensions, for example: \"births attended by trained personnel and inwhich the umbilical cord is handled under sterile conditions\" or \"institu-tional births\".To consider another example, assume that you are studying prenatal pro-grammes in two districts that aim to serve the same number of women, and youfind that both districts have weekly prenatal classes attended by about 50women. Does this mean that the prenatal parts of both MCH programmes areequally effective in ensuring the health of mothers? In what ways might theydiffer? You might consider looking into at least four factors:the number of prenatal visits;the number of tetanus toxoid injections given to the women;whether the women are correctly assessed for their \"at risk\" status (usingsuch criteria as age, height, family size, pregnancy history, nutritionalstatus and chronic disease);whether appropriate decisions on treatment or referral are made on thebasis of the risk assessment.You could assess the similarity of the two districts with respect to thesefactors. If you suspect that the districts are rather different, you might devise anew measure that incorporates those quality dimensions, such as \"the number ofwomen who make atleast two prenatalvisits,are assessed for risk andappropriately treated and referred, and receive two tetanus toxoid injections\".Because the quality of treatment is important, you should consider usingeffectiveness measures that specify a certain quality of output, such as \"patientstreated effectively\".You should also check whether the patients are comparable. Are their healthproblems similar in seriousness? Is the case mix similar?If you are considering the numbers treated for a certain condition, there arefour other major factors that you ought to take into account when thinking aboutways in which effectiveness indicators may differ in their implications for health.These factors, together with the numbers covered (by treatment, prevention, 5 1:0 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS - education, etc.), determine health impact. They are:compliance of patients with treatment prescribed;diagnostic accuracy;compliance of physicians with established protocols;efficiency, i.e. effectiveness in relation to cost.Naturally, you might be limited in dealing with these factors by lack of timeor other obstacles. You can do only as much as is practicable. Does the measure of effectiveness have side-effects?A second aspect of all measures of effectiveness that you should consider is theircomprehensiveness.The step-by-step process mentioned above, in which basicinputs are transformed into health impacts via intermediate outcomes, is clearly asimplification. There are likely to be offshoots from this main path. It is easy toneglect these, particularly if they are unintentional or negative in their effects (e.g.the occasional adverse side-effects of vaccination). If you suspect that thefrequency of these other outcomes is different for the alternatives you areconsidering, you should note them, at least, and measure them if possible.For example, you may be comparing two different vaccines against cholera.You find that they are equally effective in reducing the incidence of cholera.However, one vaccine has occasional side-effects. These effects should bereported as part of your comparative analysis. Your results can then be used todecide to what extent the side-effects should influence policy.Another illustration of possible side-effects can be found in exercise 5B,page 123. Does the measure cover the most desirable effect?The indicators of effectiveness should reflect the outcome in which you are mostinterested: the intervention with the greatest effectiveness is the best (though itmight also be more expensive and less efficient). The desirable outcomes mayseem obvious: more staff trained, more drugs distributed, less malnutrition, andso forth. But you need to think carefully about the programme's ultimate goaland whether your measure reflects it.For example, a reduction in malnutrition may appear to be an unquestionableobjective of a nutrition programme. However, a successful nutrition programmemay actually lead to an increasein the number of malnourished children becauseitsaves some children who would otherwise have died, but who remainmalnourished. You must decide what you want to achieve so that you can pickthe best measure. (Here, a combined mortality/malnutrition indicator might beappropriate.) G0 MODULE 5: MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS Is the measure sufficiently sensitive?Deaths in children under five years of age may seem like a good indicator (thoughdifficult to measure) of the effectiveness of a diarrhoeal diseases control pro-gramme. In fact, however, it may actually obscure the achievements oftheprogramme by being too stringent. Even when deaths from diarrhoea arereduced, overall child mortality may remain the same. This seems to be becausechildren saved from death from diarrhoea are often weak and are likely to dieanyway from other causes, notably measles.If reducing child mortality is the ultimate goal, then the programme would bejudged unsuccessful in a sample analysis. Yet some would argue that thereduction in diarrhoea deaths has a value in itself. It does, after all, represent someincrease in life expectancy, and can be seen as a prerequisite for other diseasecontrol measures to have an impact on overall child mortality.Alternative measures of effectiveness in this case are not easily found, butthere is a need for them. One might be the average number of years survivedafter treatment (if measurable). What would you suggest? Measuring effectivenessOne way to estimate effectiveness is to measure the change in an indicator overthe period you are interested in. This is valid only if you have reason to believethat the change is a result of the resource inputs to your programme. Theprocedure for this estimation is sketched out here. It is kept brief because of theassumption that underlies this manual, namely, that you already have someexperience of designing or interpreting evaluation studies, and know aboutcontrol or comparison groups and other relevant points. If you do not knowenough about these things, you can supplement this module by further reading orby talking with a specialist in evaluation.To measure change in an indicator of effectiveness you need to know its valuebefore and after the measurement period. Sometimes this is easy: for example, thenumber of staff trained in a training programme can readily be found (thoughtheir subsequent deployment might not be so easy to follow). Sometimes it isvery difficult. To find out whether there are fewer deaths in a community, andwhether the lower death rate is attributable to your programme, may be quitedifficult;you need to know how many deaths there were before theprogramme started and how many afterwards. If these statistics ire not collectedroutinely, you may have to do community surveys.If you cannot collect data on all events (that is,all the deaths in thecommunity), you will need to take a sample. The sample should be large enoughto enable you to detect any important changes. Often sampling requires sometechnical assistance. UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS You will need to decide how much of the change that you observe is due tothe intervention you are interested in. Sometimes this is easy. For example, ifyour measure of the effectiveness of a nutrition education programme is thenumber of mothers attending classes, you can monitor this directly. However, ifthe indicator you choose is the reduction in malnutrition, it may be quite difficultto work out whether the changes in malnutrition were due to the educationprogramme or some other factor, such as a good harvest.In such cases, where it is difficult to trace effectiveness, it may be necessary tocompare your test group with a population that was not exposed to theintervention (i.e. where there was no nutrition education programme). Ideally allother features of the second group should be the same. This should tell youwhether the change would have happened even without the intervention. Thesecomparison groups are called \"controls\".Some effectiveness measures can be derived from others. For example, it ispossible to measure the effectiveness of a vaccination programme in controllingdisease incidence either directly, or by the following approach:effectiveness= number vaccinated x efficacy of the vaccine.Hov,,ever, this assumes that you already know the efficacy of the vaccine.Many health-related outcomes, and some service inputs and effects, varythroughout the year. It is therefore important to measure these effects over thewhole year. It will probably be difficult to measure all the effects; for example,health facilities may not collate their data into annual figures or monthly statisticsand may not report them promptly. You may therefore need to take a sample,using a random selection of daily or weekly records (see the discussion ofsampling in Module 3).In some cases, the effects of a programme will continue beyond the period ofthe investment. For example, an education programme may affect behaviour inthe long term. If you are able to measure these long-term effects, you will need toadjust them in order to include them in the measurement of the effectiveness ofyour programme. Technical assistance will probably be needed for this \"discoun-ting\" step (which is covered in more detail in Module 10). Locating data on effectivenessIn the interests of practical assessment of programmes, you would do well toconcentrate on identifying suitable measures of effectiveness that can be obtainedfrom existing records. If the data currently being collected routinely are reallyinadequate for your purposes, investigate the possibility of improving the systemwithin the limits of your time and resources. Some of the common sources ofroutinely collected data are listed below, together with an indication of the typesof data that may be useful as measures of effectiveness. Where it is not obvious in 94 MODULE 5: MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS the table, you may find it useful to identify the specific types of programme towhich each measure could be applied.You should be alert to the possibility of using other surveys or censuses tocollect your effectiveness data If a study of behavioural changes or health impactis being conducted for other reasons, you should take the opportunity toincorporate & cost analysis into it, provided that its staff can accommodate yourneeds. Source of data Type of data Health facility data (clinicregisters, patient records) Hospital data Campaign reports Laboratory recordsNotifiable diseases registersInventoriesInfant mortalityTBA and community recordsAttendance at preventive and curative sessions; diagnosis:laboratory results; treatment, drugs. and contraceptives pre-scribed and distributed; nutrition statusAs above and, for inpatients, the outcome of treatment; data onprevious treatment; number of births in the hospitalVaccinations given in immunization campaigns: no. of peoplestarting to use contraception as a result of family planningcampaignsDiagnosis of certain conditions (e g. malaria, cholera)Incidence of notifiable diseasesAmount of drugs produced, delivered or distributedMajor causes of deathLow birth weight Expressing measures of effectivenessYour measure of effectiveness has to be quantitative. It could be in figures, suchas 50 children vaccinated, or 30 000 capsules produced, or 1200 visits. It is alsopossible to express effectiveness as a proportion, for example the percentage ofchildren vaccinated. Proportions ate a useful measure of coverage, but can bedifficult to interpret in combination with cost data. We do not recommend thatyou use them. Express your results as a single number rather than a ratiowhenever possible. An example of this would be the numberof children who havebeen immunized, rather than the proportionof the target population.You should define as precisely as possible what your effectiveness indicatormeans. If the effects are expressed in terms of people, you should considerwhether it is necessary to define age, sex and place of residence. You should alsospecify as precisely as possible the event you are measuring. If your outcome is\"number of people treated for disease X\", be precise about the kind of treatmentthat you are including and about your definition of the disease as well as thegroup of people. If your outcome is \"number of staff to do task Y\", give precise63 UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS details of the task and the staff members who are to be included. If your outcomeis \"amount of service Z produced\", define Z as precisely as you can. In this way,you are forced to be entirely clear about what you are measuring, and theremainder of the analysis will be much easier.Now complete this module by doing exercises 5C and 5D, pages 123-125. MODULEA.,Calculating unit financial costs It is now time to put together some of the key ideas and measures that you havealready studied, especially those concerning health service costs (Module 4) andeffects (Module 5). They are used here to calculate unit costs. This module is ashort one, setting the stage for the refinements and extensions to come in part Band the applications described in part C. General nature of unit costsA unit cost is a kind of simple averagethe cost per unit of output or outcome. Itcan be applied to many things in the analysis of PHC, as illustrated in the nextsection.The basic calculation of a unit cost (often called average cost) is not difficult.Where the total cost and the quantity of output have been found:total costunit cost =quantityIt is important to remember that at this point we are concerned with unitfinancial costs, i.e. costs expressed in terms of financial outlay. Other types of unitcosts, in which cost is defined to include other economic dimensions, areconsidered in later modules. Examples of unit costsBy the time you have finished this manual, you will have calculated and put touse many kinds of unit costs. For now, though, it is helpful to see what measureshave been used in one kind of PHC programme, namely an immunizationprogramme. Some important unit cost measures for immunizationsby nomeans allare given below:for an immediate service (output): cost per dose administered (this could besubdivided by type of vaccine);for an intermediate effect: cost per fully immunized child (this could besubdivided by vaccine);for a final effect or impact on health status: cost per case averted or perdeath averted (elaborations might include cost per year of life saved).These examples of unit costs are based on the assumption that the appropriatecosts can be assigned or allocated to each output or outcome involved. For UNIT FINANCIAL COSTS example, if the immunization programme is part of a wider maternal and childhealth (MCH) effort, its cost must be separated from other MCH costs. Forantigen-specific measures within the programme, all relevant costs must beestimated; for example, to calculate the cost per dose of measles vaccineadministered, only the portion of total costs reasonably attributable to measlesvaccination (vaccine plus a proportion of all shared costs) should be used.Naturally, illustrations of unit costs can be found at all levels of the healthsystem. The manager of a health centre will be concerned with the unit cost ofservic-.-.. A regional programme director might wish to compare cost per dose forall health centres and other service delivery sites within a district or region, whilethe national immunization programme director will be interested in averagevalues for all the regions of the country. An MCH programme director will wishto know the costs of a variety of primary services, not just immunizations, andprobably site by site.For some initial practice in organizing information, in preparation for calcu-lating and interpreting the unit costs of a different kind of health programme(malaria control), see exercise OA, page 126. Uses of unit costsCalculating unit financial costs is straightforward in principle, but the practicalresults will only be as good as the elements that go into each calculation. If yourestimates of total cost or quantity are flawed, your unit costs will be, too.The uses of cost analysis will frequently justify your efforts in workingthrough this manual and putting what you have learned to use in real studies ofyour own. Some of the uses of cost analysis have been described in earliermodules, and others will be dealt with later. Certain of them rely on simple unitcosts of outputs, which allow you to compare the administrative efficiency ofvarious service delivery units. Others involve intermediate effects as the denomi-nators for preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis; the example we used earlierwas cost per fully immunized child. More ambitious cost-effectiveness analysesare directed at health status impacts, using, for example, a measure of cost perdeath averted.You will also find it useful to break down the cost estimates by type of input.It is especially useful to be able to isolate personnel costs and examine them overtime or across delivery units to see how efficiently staff are being used. Thatapplication and others are discussed further in later modules. 66 PART BCost-effectiveness analysis Measuring and using economic costs What are economic costs?Costs are often thought of in terms of money paid for resources used; but there isa broader way of looking at costs that can be useful in some cases. The basic ideais that things have avaluethat might not be fully captured in their price. Itis notdifficult in many health programmes to identify resource inputs for which little orno money ispaid: volunteers working without payment; health messagesbroadcast without charge; vaccines or other supplies donated or provided at alarge discount by organizations or individuals.Should we say that these inputs cost nothing? The answer depends on whatyou are interested in. For some purposes, there is no need to take into accountresources that are not paid for. This is true, for example, if your concern is solelyto determine how much of a financial budget allocation was actually spent.Resources for which you paid nothing do not appear as expenditure and can beignored (i.e. their financial cost is zero).However, if you are concerned with the long-term sustainability of yourprogramme, the total cost of all inputseven those temporarily provided bydonors or paid for at below market ratesmust be estimated. In addition, publicofficials should be concerned with the full resource consequences of implemen-ting a health programme. In marshalling resources for the benefit of oneprogramme, society is forfeiting the opportunity to use them for some alternativeactivity. This lost opportunity is a cost that society bears. For example, the timethat volunteers devote to your health programme might be time that they wouldotherwise use to work on their land or in a paid job. 'The return they would getfrom these alternative activities is a measure of the cost of the time they devoteto your programme.Econoinists use the terms \"opportunity cost\" or \"economic cost\" to describethis approach to costing. It recognizes the cost of using resources that could havebeen productively used elsewhere.Analyses using economic costs do not replace those using financial costs, butsupplement them with additional information useful for decision-making. How to measure economic costsDonated goods and servicesThe types of goods and services commonly donated to health programmes byindividuals and communities include labour, construction materials and food.68 COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS Private and public enterprises frequently provide resources, such as free time on television or radio, newspaper space and transport. The easiest way to valuedonated goods and services is to look at the prices they command in the openmarket. For example, in the case of radio time you could find out what the radiostation normally charges for advertising (if this is what it would otherwise do with the time slot allocated to your programme), taking into account the durationand time of day. For volunteer labour, you could find out whether those peoplereceive a salary or wages elsewhere and use that to cost their donated time. Ifthey are not currently employed, you could use wage rates paid to workers whodo equivalent work in the health system, or the average agricultural wage in the area, or the current minimum wage.When you make allowarices for donations or any other adjustments of thekinds covered in this module in order to estimate economic costs, be sure to labelyour cost results clearly, stating which costs are economic ones and which are financial ones. To consider donated resources further, as part of economic costestimation, see exercise 7A, page 127. Other inputs whose price is incorrectThe concept of opportunityor economic cost has applications beyond valuingnon-paid-for resources. It also calls into question the appropriateness of the prices used in valuing all resources,even those that are paid for. It cannot be assumedthat the price paid for theresources used in your programme always reflects thetrue value of those resources to society. Economists use the term \"shadow price\"to refer to a price that has been adjusted for various reasons, including donations, to yield economic cost.Shadow pricing may be needed in other situations where an input price isincorrect (in an economic sense), for example, where a resource used in aprogramme has been subsidized so that it appears to be worth less than it really is. An illustration might bea medical specialist who is paid partly by theprogramme and partly from some other national source of funds or even by an external aid organization. Someone is paying the subsidy that enables yourprogramme to receive the resource relatively cheaply. Similarly, with inputs thatare taxed, your department or programme may be paying extra, bui those extra funds are simply transferred and used for other purchases, and should not beincluded in estimating the economic costs of that resource.Costing is never complete or perfect when you have to deal with prices thathave been distorted by taxes, subsidies or other factors. Where a distortionappears to have an appreciable effect on total costspersonnel is a good exampleyou should attempt to present the results both with and withoutappropriate adjustment. For example, legislation may fix minimum or maximumprices for some resources: a minimum wage for workers is a common example.Setting a minimum wage artificially increases the price of lower-level labour. In MODULE 7 MEASURING AND USING ECONOMIC COSTS D other words, some people are being paid at a rate that does not reflect the valueof their output. The cost to society of employing them in the programme is notrepresented accurately by their wage, but by some lesser amount that reflects thevalue of their output in employment where there is no minimum wage. Insituations of high unemployment, the economic cost of labour may be close tozeroanother potentially important case.Inputs that require foreign exchange pose other complications for calculatingtrue costs. Important equipment and supplies, such as certain drugs, are oftenimported and thus require foreign exchange. If you want to value them ineconomic-cost terms, you must use an exchange rate to express the value of theforeign currency in terms of domestic currency. The exchange rate set bygovernment may be unrealistic in comparison with actual currency market rates.Usually, foreign exchange is in short supply in developing countries. However,the official exchange rate often does not reflect this fact and makes foreignexchange appear to be cheaper than it really is, thus undervaluing importedinputs. Health officials generally cannot be expected to make exchange rateadjustments, but help should be available, especially for higher-level (e.g.national) cost analyses. If you are involved in such studies, seek advice from thegovernment planning office, the Ministry of Finance or the central bank about theappropriate \"shadow prices\" to use for foreign exchange as well as labour. Capital inputsThe special nature of capital (nonrecurrent) inputs and methods of estimatingtheir financial costs on an annual-equivalent or other basis were described inModule4.With economic costs, you will usually be concerned with the cost ofresources used over a specific period (say, one year), rather than at the time theyare purchased. For recurrent costs, resources purchased and resources used in agive.n year are likely to be very similar. Differences will only exist if theprogramme is not in equilibrium, and stocks are being either built up or run down.However, capital items are, by their nature, bought in one year and used forseveral years more. As explained in Module 4,we need a way of spreading outthe costs over the study period. Module 4shows one approach which is valid formost purposes: simply divide the total capital cost by the number of years of theitem's expected life to give a kind of depreciation. However, this is not adequateif you are interested in economic costs, which must take into account the value ofalternative opportunities for using the resources tied up in the capital inputs.We present below an approach to economic costing of capital. This approachhas some disadvantages and is not always used in health cost studies. It is not assimple as depreciation, which discourages some potential users, especially at thelocal level. In addition, its basic concern for alternative uses of resources ignoresthe fact that the costs of I ying up funds might be of greater importance to otheragencies than to the Ministry of Health or a particular programme (or, to put it70 COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS differently, that certain capital costs do not accrue to the ministry or programme).Still, estimates of the economic cost of capital inputs can provide usefulinformation, especially from the perspective of national allocation of scarceresources, so itis worth considering a reasonable way of making them. Theapproach is described here for the case of equipment, but it could also apply tovehicles. Costing of another important category of nonrecurrent inputs, buildingspace, is probably better achieved by estimates based on the rental value, asexplained in Module 4. That module also suggested a cut-off value of $100 todistinguish equipment from supplies.Consider the example of a piece of equipment which costs $10 000 and has auseful life of 10 years. To suggest that this is equivalent to $1000 per year(10 000/10) is to overlook a very important fact. If you invest the $10 000 in thispiece of equipment, that money will be tied up for the whole period of 10 years.On the other hand, if you are only paying out $1000 per year, you could bereinvesting the rest ($9000 in the first year) and earning interest. After 10 years ofpaying out $1000 a year, you would have some money left over from youraccumulated interest. In other words, a $10000 initial payment actually meanspaying out more than $1000 per year. The precise amount depends on theearnings the money would otherwise have made (i.e. the interest rate). Fortunate-ly, there are tables which make the necessary calculations quite straightforward.To calculate the economic cost of equipment on an \"annualized\" (cost peryear) basis, use the following approach.Current value. Estimate the current value of the capital item, as the amountyou would have to pay to purchase a similar item now (i.e. the replacementvalue rather than the original price).Useful life. Estimate the total number of years of useful life the item canrealistically be expected to have (from the time of purchase).Discount rate. Find out the discount rate used by the economic planningoffice or Ministry of Finance. (A more difficult approach would be tocalculate the real rate of interest, i.e. the rate of interest that could beobtained by depositing money in the bank minus the rate of inflation, whilea simpler approach would be to accept a \"high side\" World Bank discountrate of 10%.)Annualization factor. Consult a standard table (page 142) to find the correctannualization factor.Calculation of annual cost. Calculate the annual cost by dividing the currentvalue of the item by the annualization factor.For a single $10 000 piece of equipment, the approach above would be appliedas follows:Current value: $10000Useful life: 5 years71 COSTS Discount rate: 10%Annualizing factor (from standard table): 3.791Calculation of $10000/3.791 = $2638 per year (roun-ded figure).To compare this economic cost with the corresponding financial cost, note thatthe latter would be$10000 /5 =$2000 per year. The investment of funds \"upfront\" to pay for the equipment in full at the start of its use raises the annualcostwhich is to be expected. See exercise 7B, page 127, for practice in suchcalculations. SummaryIn many situations, economic costs and financial costs are equivalent. Usefinancial costs as a starting-point for estimating economic costs; then check thefollowing three features and make adjustments if necessary:Donated goods or services. These should be valued and included in economiccosts.Distorted prices. Check with the planning office whether salaries and theofficial exchange rate are valid measures of the value of labour and foreignexchange, respectively.Capital. Instead of using expenditure and depreciation, calculate theannualized value of capital items being employed, using an appropriatediscount rate.How to use economic costsAs already discussed, economic costs can be thought of as a measure of the totalcost to society of providing a health programme. But this really serves as adescription of what economic costs are, rather than as an explanation of theirusefulness. To complete this module, we outline below some practical appli-cations of economic costs. Some aspects of this outline will be further elaboratedin Part C.One important reason for collecting data on the cost of resources used in yourprogramme is that you can better predict what the future budgetary demands arelikely to be. Donated goods and services do not place demands on the currentbudget, but it is unrealistic to expect that donors, whether external or local, willalways be prepared to support the programme. What would happen if the currentsources of donated goods or voluntary labour dried up? It is useful to have arough idea of how much money would be required if contributions of a particularresource were to decline, or cease entirely.A second reason for measuring the cost of donated resources is that this canprovide a useful indicator of the capacity of government resources to generate 7 4 COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS contributions from the community or other sources. At the same time, it givessome idea of the popular appeal of different programmes, indicating areas wheredonations might be increased.The most important reason for calculating costs, which is explored in moredetail in Module 9, is to measure the relative efficiency of different ways ofimplementing a programme. This involves assessing what has to be sacrificed inorder to achieve a specified goal. The government could take a limitedperspective and decide to look at ways of maximizing the effectiveness of its ownfinancial resources. But adopting a limited perspective often does not make sensefor government bodies. They should usually be concerned with society as awhole. In other words, they should take into account allthe resources employedand not just the ones they pay for. And the answers you get can be very different,depending on your definition of costs. The broader perspective is especiallyimportant for administrators and policy-makers at the highest level.Consider, for example, the manager of a water supply project whose budgetcovers the purchase of pumps but not their installation, which is the responsibil-ity of the community. She has the choice of two pumps. They both work equallywell, but one is slightly cheaper and requires much more labour to install. If themanager were concerned simply with maximizing the returns of the financialinvestment, she would probably purchase the cheaper pumps, since she can getmore of them for the same money. In doing so, however, she is probably placinga substantial burden on individuals, especially those at lower levels of the healthsystem, who will have to do more installation work. The sacrifice they are calledon to make may be so substantial that the pumps are not, in fact, installed,thereby rendering the initial investment worthless. If the manager had taken intoaccount the community resources required, she might well have chosen theslightly more expensive pumps. Thus, it would be desirable to take a broad viewof pump selection, based on economiccosts. (Of course, there are other costs toconsider in this casefor example, the cost of maintaining the pumps afterinstallation.)Economic costs can also be used in the same way as financial costs. Calculatingannualized economic costs encourages you to think about: cost per unit of serviceas an indicator of efficiency; cost per beneficiary, per head, or per household as ameasure of equity; and cost per head as a measure of priority. It is only when itcomes to certain aspects of affordability and to comparisons with budgetallocations that itis inappropriate to use economic costs rather than financialcosts.To conclude your review of the economic costs of a programme, you will findit usefuleven necessaryto prepare a summary table of economic casts ofeach standard category of inputs, identifying the source that has provided orsupported the cost. Then you can calculate the full programme costs. This processis partly illustrated in exercise 7C, page 128.73t^. m .1rt6p.6L00,Household costs In Module 7, we explained about costs that embrace more than simply theamount paid for resources. You were encouraged to consider the completeeconomic costs borne by society in providing the services of your programme.Here, the concept of costs is extended to those incurred by people receivinghealth carethe consumers. This goes a long way beyond costs confined toproducers. You might wish to consider household costs for special purposes,including setting fees when cost recovery is an objective. At other timesprobably for most studiesyou will not have to go so far in your collection andinterpretation of cost data. Nevertheless, you should know something abouthousehold costs to broaden your range of skills in cost analysis. What are household costs?From the perspective of society as a whole, the costs of obtaining health care andother services are just as pertinent as the costs of producing services. Economistswould say that the \"demand\" side of health service utilization is as pertinent asthe \"supply\" side.What are the principal elements of the costs incurred in receiving care? Totake advantage of the treatment or education available in a health centre, peopleneed to travel to the centre and wait their turn. To do this, they may have to taketime off from paid work and forfeit wages. Or they may sacrifice useful time athome. They may have to pay for public transport, consultations and medicines. Ifhouses are sprayed with insecticide for malaria control, householders may need tovacate their premises and empty their houses of goods. To receive healtheducation through radio broadcasts, people may need to purchase batteries andspend time listening to the programmes.Costs in time are especially important. A study of treatment for malaria inThailand found that about 90% of estimated costs to patients were time costs.You can probably provide information about this from your own experience. Notonly the patients but also other members of the household are likely to beinvolved, spending time caring for patients or accompanying them to the placewhere health care is delivered. Costs may also be incurred by people who go tohealth facilities but receive no treatment. They may find that the health centre isclosed, that the drugs they need are not in stock, or that they cannot afford towait. Other time costs include those for taking medication or treating oneself orone's children (e.g. preparing and giving oral rehydration salts solutions for 144 COST - EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS diarrhoea). Consider household costs further by completing exercise 8A,page 130.The term \"cost\" of health care is sometimes used to refer to problems sufferedby people who cannot obtain care or who use poor-quality services. Theseproblems can obviously include pain, worry and disability or death for thesufferer. These difficulties are better thought of as negative benefitsthat is,failures to receive the benefits of carerather than costs. The discussion here islimited to the cost of providing and obtaining health services. The large andcomplicated topic of benefits (or \"costs\" where benefits are negative) is notconsidered.Why measure household costs?One basic reason for measuring household costsat least, in some studiesis toobtain a better understanding of user behaviour. To be useful, services must beused. Knowing the costs that householders bear if they use a service may helpyou to predict whether and how much the service will be used, or explain why itwill not.People will decide whether to seek a service for themselves or for someone intheir household on the basis of its expected value. If they have to walk too far, orwait too long, or pay too high a price (assuming that fees are to be considered as\"household costs\"), they may decide against seeking some or all of the possibleservices. Where there are alternative types of care, such as traditional healers, therelative costs and benefits of these will enter into the decision.Several factors appear likely to influence the anticipated satisfaction thatpatients receive from health services. They include the availability of drugs, thequalifications and attitudes of the staff, the sophistication of the equipment andthe perceived success of previous contacts with the service. Some studies suggestthat perceived quality of service is more important than fees when consumers arechoosing .a health service. Patients may avoid convenient but suspect healthservices in order to obtain treatment they prefer elsewhere.If fee setting is being considered for your programme, you might try to obtainthe following information about your target population:the average household income;the amount the population is willing to pay for specified services for thehousehold;the percentage of average household income and the cost per head thatwould be represented by the estimated cost of providing certain services(or the entire programme).You may be able to think of other information you would like to have. It isworth repeating, though, that household costs will only need to be considered ina few cost studies, so you may not often need to seek the above data.75 MODULE 8: HOUSEHOLD COSTS While understanding user behaviour is one basic reason for looking athousehold costs, another is to try to minimize the cost of health care to society asa wholein order to make sure that all scarce resources, including consumers'time, are used to their best advantage. Often, some trade-off between producers'and consumers' costs is required. For example, the more health centres andoutreach facilities there are, the more costly it is for the health programme, butthe more convenient and less costly it is for the patients. Some compromise isnecessary, and it is often not easy to decide on the optimum arrangement. Take amoment now to consider how you would balance the conflicting costs that youidentified at the end of exercise 8A (page 130).Sometimes there are clear cases where failure to consider the users of healthservices leads to decisions that impose unnecessary costs on them. For example, acommon phenomenon in many health facilities throughout the world is queues ofpatients, sometimes waiting for treatment for several hours in uncomfortable andcrowded conditions.Sometimes this situation is caused by a lack of resources at the centre.However, very often a few simple changes (at minimal cost to the health centre)could substantially reduce waiting times and discomfort of patients. Thesechanges may include redistribution of staff, rationalization of procedures so thatpeople do not have to move in a series of queues, providing a few shadedbenches, and perhaps changing opening hours.A study in India found the following: If in one week eight patients came froma particular village for treatment, the cost to them would be 64 rupees fortransport (hire of a bullock cart at Rs 8 per day), a total of Rs 80 for drugs (thepatients being on average slightly more sick than if they had been treated athome), and Rs 32 in wages lost (Rs 2 per day for patient and accompanyingrelative). If, on the other hand, the mobile team visited the village to treat thesame patients, the cost of transport would be Rs 20 and the cost of drugs Rs 20.5.In this case, it was demonstrated that the mobile team would save householdcosts and apparently delivery-system (producers') costs as well.Higher costs to the users of health services are sometimes reflected in cost-effectiveness measures, which will be studied more closely in Module 9. If thecost to patients goes over some threshold, patients may stop using the facility,attendance will fall, and the cost per person treated may well increase whileresources will be underused.If you attempt to combine health provider costs and household costs tocompare them in different interventions, it is important to avoid double-counting.In some cases, the costs of the health service are shifted directly to thehouseholder. For example, if fees are charged for drugs, you should not countthem both as a cost to the health programme and as a cost to the householder. Ifthe patient is paying $0.50 for a drug that costs the health service $2.50 toprovide, the total cost to society of the drug is $2.50, not $3.00. 1:13 COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS How to measure household costsIf you are interested only in the costs of using health services (or a particularservice), you can study the individuals who attend health centres, hospitals (ifthey are involved in your programme) and other facilities. You could interview asample of patients, asking them about the household costs associated with theircurrent use of the facilities and also about previous visits. You could ask themtheir reasons for using (or not using) a particular facility rather than availablealternatives, and how satisfied they have been with the quality of care. Staffmembers at the facility might be a good supplementary source for certaininformation, such as the probable cost in time to the patients of visiting eachfacility and waiting there. Another source of information would be patientrecords, which may yield useful data about drugs prescribed and the distance ofpatients' homes from the facility.Of course, facility-based studies do not tell you anything about the costs topersons who did not use your programme for some of their services. To estimatethese costs, you could sample other programmes to ask similar questions to theabove, but that is not commonly done. Even if you do sample other programmes,if you wish to learn the relative importance of each of the different options (and,indeed, that of having no treatment at all), you must also do a household survey.Household surveys, requiring visits to people's homes, are difficult and ex-pensive; they should be done only if the results are likely to influence the futuredirection of your programme and if you have the time and funds necessary toconduct them. Before you start on such a survey, think carefully about how theresults could influence future health service design.You cannot realistically expect that reading this manual will make you into aspecialist in household surveys. If a survey has not already been conducted by,for example, an external donor or university, you may want to seek advice orhelp from specialists, e.g. in a government department or local university. For aquick practicein using household survey data, see exercise 8B, page 130.Whether or not you are able to use actual survey data and other detailedinformation on household costs, make a point in your cost study reports ofdescribing such costs qualitatively, so that you do not lose sight of them. Thiswill protect you against the danger of \"allowing the quantified to drive out theimportant\". For some purposes, all costs count. Cost-effectiveness analysis Cost-effectiveness analysis is a technique to assist you in decision-making. It isone of the tools available to help you to identify areas of your health programmethat are inefficient and to help you to design a better programme. A cost-effectiveness study involves assessing the gains (effectiveness) and resource inputrequirements (costs) of alternative ways of achieving a specified objective. Theresults are usually expressed in terms of cost per unit of effectiveness for eachalternative. The alternative with the lowest cost per unit of effectiveness is themost cost-effective and is generally to be preferred on grounds of economicefficiency.This technique can be applied to a whole range of questions that facemanagers of health programmes: from broad issues (e.g. which PHC programmeto invest more funds in) to debates about specific details, such as the most suitablelength for a training course.A cost-effectiveness study should be done, if possible, whenever you are facedwith a choice of options. It may not always be worth doing a rigorous analysis,but the general approach is worth following. Perhaps more money has becomeavailable and you need to decide where best to spend it; perhaps you have a newidea about where your programme should be going and need to convince othersof its merits; perhaps you are evaluating the outcome of a programme andrecognize that the evaluation provides an excellent opportunity to do a cost-effectiveness analysis.A wide variety of issues can be examined in this way. They include, amongothers, choices of technology (e.g. choice of drugs for maternal and child healthcare activity or choice of pump for a water supply project), choices of deliverystrategy (e.g. hospital versus clinic treatment of diarrhoeal disease), and choices' oftarget (e.g. tetanus toxoid immunization for pregnant women or for all women ofchildbearing age). Although the issues addressed and the programmes involvedcan be quite diverse, there are five steps that are required for every cost-effectiveness analysis. Stated in terms of a programme, they involve:defining the programme's objectives;identifying the possible ways of achieving those objectives;identifying and measuring the costs of each option;identifying and measuring the effectiveness of each option;calculating the cost-effectiveness of each option and interpreting theresults. COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS Define the objectives of the programmeThe incentive for doing a cost-effectiveness study often comes from identifying aparticular problem: for example, drugs are not readily available in rural areas, orcontraceptive use in the communities is low, or malnutrition is common inchildren. In formulating the problem, you will usually automatically imply whatthe desired objective of the programme is. For example, the problem \"contracep-tive use in the communities is low\" implies that your objective is \"to increasecontraceptive use\" for various possible reasons.It is usually helpful to refine the statement of the problem by exploring thenature of the possible causes, which might be suggested to you by experienceand by past evaluation reports. For example, you may discover that contra-ceptives are not available in the health centres and conclude that this isprobably the reason why contraceptive use is low. So you reformulate theproblem as \"inadequate supplies of contraceptives\" and the objective as\"increasing supplies of contraceptives to health centres\". You may find thatmalnutrition seems to be a consequence of feeding children the wrong foods atthe weaning stage, so your objective would be to encourage the use of betterweaning foods.The more precise your statement of objectives, the easier it is to use cost-effectiveness analysis, because both the costs and effects are likely to be moreclearly defined and easier to measure and interpret. Specify the objectivesquantitatively if possible: for example, \"to reduce mortality from tetanus by25%\". Itis normally easier if objectives expressed in percentage terms aretranslated into numbers. For example, if there are currently 400 tetanus deathsper year, the objective becomes to avert 100 deaths.Cost-effectiveness studies may also be stimulated by a particular objectivebeing set for you; for instance, the Ministry of Health informs you that it wishesto increase contraceptive coverage. It may simply wish to know whether the wayyou are currently doing something (e.g. distributing contraceptives) is the mostefficient, or whether there may be better ways of doing it.The objectives you are aiming for will depend not only on the type ofprogramme you are involved in (for example, maternal and child health,education or disease control) and the sort of problems that emerge from it, butalso on the scope of your responsibilities. Administrators at different levels arefaced with different kinds of questions and objectives. A national manager mightneed to decide which type of refrigerator to use for the national vaccination coldchain. A district manager may be considering whether to use mobile or fixedfacilities for distribution. The head of a health centre may wish to investigate howstaff time should be allocated. In some cases at any level, data can be found toshow how well the ultimate objective of health programmesimproving healthstatus (i.e. reducing mortality or morbidity)is being achieved. MODULE 9: COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS 0 For a start on practical cost-effectiveness work of your own, see exercise 9A,page 132. Identify the possible ways of achieving the objectivesYou need to identify at least two possible ways of achieving the objectives youhave identified. A single cost-effectiveness result on its own tells you very littleabout efficiency. Consider the following example. A research worker undertook acost-effectiveness study of treatment for a certain disease and found that aparticular drug cost $20 per patient treated. What did that tell him about whetherit was worth while to use that drug? Very little, without some basis forcomparison. Investigation of the two most likely alternative drugs to treat thesame disease revealed a cost of $100 per patient for each. After that, theresearcher could begin to make some judgements about the merits of the firstdrug on efficiency grounds. For each option identified, be sure to describe it insufficient detail. You may want to go back later and attempt to identify thefeatures that made some options more cost-effective than others.How do you identify suitable options? This will depend on whether yourcost-effectiveness study is a response to the discovery of a particular problem, oris more exploratory. Each of these situations is explained and illustrated below. Response to a problemIf the cost-effectiveness study is in response to the identification of a particularproblem or issue, then the options you consider will represent the possiblesolutions you have identified for that problem. It is useful to consider a widerange of options at first, so as not to miss the best solution. When you havedecided on your list of options, you should be careful to compare them with thebest possible alternatives known to you, and not simply those that are beingimplemented at present. For example, take a country which currently importsbrand-name drugs, and is considering whether to supplement or replace thatapproach by manufacturing drugs domestiLally. An analysis that simply com-pared domestic production with the current system (importing brand-nameproducts) might suggest that domestic production is preferable. If, however, thepossibility of importing generic drugs is also included in the cost-effectivenessanalysis, the answer may be different. Including it may complicate the analysis,but would produce useful results.Once you have generated an initial list of options, you probably need to beselective; a full cost-effectiveness analysis of all conceivable options is usuallycostly and unnecessary. You can narrow down the options to a manageableselection by eliminating those that:cannot be accommodated within the existing budget constraints; 80 70 COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS are clearly less efficient than other options on the basis of a roughcalculation of costs and effects;are not feasible in technical and political terms (consider all options thathave powerful political support even if they are unworkable; if they reallyare poor options in economic terms, this needs to be carefully docu-mented);cannot be analysed easily and cheaply in time to influence decision-making.See exercise9B,page132,to apply some of these ideas. Exploratory studyAn exploratory study can involve comparing the performance of two or moreapproaches currently being used to meet some objective, or examining theexpected performance of completely new approaches to an objective. The natureof the options is likely to be less clearly specified than for a problem-solvingresponse. For example, you may decide simply to compare the way differenthealth centres provide curative treatment or the way different districts distributedrugs. You may not have identified the specific characteristics that you think arelikely to make one option more or less efficient. It may not be until you havestudied a number of examples that you realize which characteristics are respon-sible for making some options more efficient. For example, you may find, afterstudying two immunization strategies, e.g. mass campaigns and routine services,that certain features (promotion through the mass media or more reliablerefrigeration to prevent vaccine wastage) are among the crucial characteristicscontributing to efficiency.No matter how clearly specified the options may be at the start of youranalysis, you may have to restrict the study to a few of them owing to limitationsof funds and time. If so, you can narrow them down by focusing on theapproaches that seem to use more resources and so might benefit more from anyimprovement inefficiency, or by selecting a mixture of some promisingapproaches and some weaker ones to see whether you can identify the keydifferences. Identify and measure the costs of each optionFor each of the options chosen for analysis, you will need to measure the costsGuidelines for doing that have already been given (in Modules 4and6forfinancial costs and Module 7for economic costs). For assessment of trueeconomic efficiency, economic costs will be needed.There are some specific points to bear in mind when estimating costs for thepurpose of cost-effectiveness analysis. For one thing, the cost and effectiveness MODULE 9. COST - EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS measures must be linked for each alternative studied. The resources you arecosting should be those that are responsible for producing the effects you will bemeasuring. Usually, this means that you should be measuring the costs and theeffectiveness over approximately the same period of time, although for healthstatus effects that require some time to appear, there would be a delay after theperiod when the programme's costs are incurred. Take a few minuteswithoutdoing a full exerciseto think of examples where there are likely to be significantdelays between using the resources and achieving an effect. How (and when)would you measure cost-effectiveness in such cases?Another thing to stress about costs is the need to be comprehensivethat is,to include in your cost measurements all the inputs that are put to work in thatoption. Use the categories given in Module 1, page 6, as a checklist to ensurethat you are not overlooking resources that should be included. When you thinkyou have included all the relevant resources, check again by going through thelist and identifying: (1) every relevant function; (2)every contributor;(3)everylevel at which the option is employed. Donations as well as paid-for resourcesshould be included. However, in your efforts to be comprehensive for eachalternative, take care not to count any resources more than once. If you use theinput categories proposed, double-counting is unlikely.Where a new service, or set of services is being added to an existingprogrammefor instance, when a new vaccine (e.g. against hepatitis B virus) isbeing added to the existing national immunization programmeit will besufficient to look only at the costs and effects of the new components. Themethod that economists usually prefer is to count only the additional orincremental costs (which they would call \"marginal costs\") of the new compon-ent. In a different situation, two or more options may differ from each other inonly a few of the inputs used; in this case, only the costs (and effects) of thoseinputs need to be compared. However, by doing this, you run the risk ofoverlooking other differences, and obscuring the exact meaning of the cost-effectiveness indicator. It is therefore probably wiser to include the costs of allinputs for each option. Identify and measure the effectiveness of each optionModule 5 covers measures of effectiveness at some length. Review it to remindyourself about the different types of measure and the qualities that make somebetter than others,It is important to he sure that the effects you are measuring result from theresource inputs whose costs you are also calculating. Sometimes, identifyingresults (that is, determining cause and effect) is not easy. You should simply makethe best judgements possible in each case.Z 173 COSY-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS Calculate and interpret the cost-effectiveness of each optionYou can calculate the cost-effectiveness ratio for each option by dividing its costby the numerical value of the chosen effect. The ratios are then compared todetermine the most cost-effective optionthat is, the one costing the least perunit of effect achieved.Often it is necessary to make assumptions about some variables whose exactvalue is uncertain. These variables may be ones involved in calculations ofeither costs or effectiveness. For example, the planning ministry may not have astandard discount rate, so you may instead use a commercial interest rate or aWorld Bank figure as a proxy for capital costs. Or your estimates of the amountof time that staff devote to a particular programme may be only approximate(a fairly common problem). Or you may have a variable, such as a p..i ze, that haschanged over time and you have used the average value. To deal with this kindof uncertainty for a particular assumption, define a plausible range of values forthe variable, or take (1) your best estimate, (2) twice that estimate and (3) half ofit. Taking each of these figures in turn (or using the values at either end of theplausible range), calculate how the results of your analysis change with thedifferent values. If your conclusion as to the most cost-effective option changes,then the conclusions are said to be sensitive to your assumption about the valueof that variable. The process of testing how changes in assumptions affectchanges in results is called sensitivity analysis.Having established which of the options is the most cost-effective, artimportant follow-up step is to decide what is responsible for the differencesamong them. This may guide you in modifying the design or improving theimplementation of a programme. For example, having identified which healthcentres are the least cost-effective within a programme, you might then look inmore detail at the factors responsible for this. You may find, for example, thathealth centres with a particular cadre of health worker are less efficient, or thatsome units are underused. You could follow this up with further studies lookingspecifically at the cost-effectiveness of different cadres of health workers. or at thecost implications of an inefficient use of staff time. Of course, the effects mustremain comparable over time if this process is to be of any value.Another possible follow-up is to study the cost profiles of the options underconsideration. Which input categories account for a significantly differentpercentage of the total cost in the more cost-effective and less cost-effectiveoptions? Does this appear to explain the difference in cost-effectiveness? Can theleast cost-effective option be improved by changing the way resources are used?All these possible influences on cost (and, thus, on cost-effectiveness) arediscu\"sed further in Module 12.To inter,et the results further, look at overall effectiveness. Could differencesin scale explain the differences in cost-effectiveness? What would happen if the83 MODULE 9: COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS different options were scaled up or down? Is there a particular level of output thatyou wish to achieve? If so, it would be desirable to make adjustments to all theoptions in order to see what would happen if they were operating at that level.However, there is a potential problem here. There may be no straightforwardrelationship between changes in effect and scale and it will not always be easy toformulate policies based on the adjustment and retesting suggested here. Youwill probably have a good idea when it is safe to do so and when it is not. (Theseissues are discussed further in part C.)A third way of interpreting your results is to study the different conditionsunder which the different options were operating (i.e. geography, populationdistribution and other variables). Do any of these help to explain the differencesin cost-effectiveness?The translation of inputs into effectiveness often goes through a series ofstages. For example, the provision of water and sanitation facilities can beexpected to influence health only if: (1) the facilities are working; (2)they arebeing used; (3) they are being used properly. Try to identify the key stages in thetransformation process for your programme. At what stage do the differencesbetween the options become obvious? For example, is it differences in thefunctioning, frequency of use or quality of use of the different sanitation optionsthat best explains the differences in cost-effectiveness of different sanitationtechnologies? You will need to carry out an analysis at each of these stages if theanswer to the basic question is not obvious from your examination of theconditions and the study results.To get a better feel for what is involved in cost-effectiveness analyses,including interpretation of their results, do exercises 9C and 9D, pages I33-1.35. 84 PART CUsing cost data in planning 63 Future costs Predicting the future is never easy. But it is important to make the best guessesone can. One important illustration of predictions is a budget. Budgets aredocuments that set out the activities planned for the future and outline theexpected future costs of the programme (and of programme subdivisions). Theprocess surrounding the development of a budget can be quite complicated. Itinvolves a whole series of activities, including: identifying needs, establishingpriorities, setting targets, designing programmes to meet those targets, esti-mating the costs of the programmes, fixing an upper limit on expenditure,deciding who should be involved in developing the budget and drawing up atimetable to show when discussions, submissions and budget approvals shouldtake place.This module does not attempt to explore all these issues in detail. We willfocus instead on one of them the method of estimating future costs and onthe uses to which budgets can be put in deciding what health programmes toimplement. How to estimate future costsThe method of estimating the likely future costs of a health programme has manyfeatures in common with the method of measuring existing costs covered inModules 4 and 7. For one thing, the same framework is appropriate: resources(and costs) can be classified according to type of input, the activity they are usedfor, who is expected to contribute to them, and what kind of currency is involved.Use the checklists in Module I to guide you in adapting the framework tobudgets.Also, as with existing programmes, you need to identify clearly the healthservices whose future costs you wish to estimate. In particular, this means youmust:Describe the proposed programme in as much detail as possible.Examine the resources that already exist and determine whether they havethe capacity to take on additional tasks (i.e. is there any spare capacity?).Determine the additional (incremental or marginal) resources required.Cost estimation for a future programme has other features in common withthat for existing programmes. It is sometimes appropriate to estimate in detail asample of the activities of the planned future programme and extrapolate from USING COST DATA IN PLANNING these to the full programme. It is also important to distinguish between financialcosts (money outlay) and economic costs. (You will often want to estimate bothtypes of costs.)However, there are a number of areas where differences in emphasis orprocedures emerge. For example, in the choice of the future time period, youhave considerably greater flexibility than is possible when measuring the actualcosts of an existing programme. Actual costs rely on information on use andexpenditure: there are often delays in gaining access to this information, and itsusability deteriorates over time. Information can become obsolete quite quickly,and you should always be careful when using historic data for projections. Futurecosts do not face these problems. It is usually appropriate to estimate future costsfor a period of5-10years. Naturally, the time period selected will depend onyour specific needs.There are three general approaches to estimating future costs (both economicand financial). Sometimes itis possible to use them in combination. Theseapproaches are explained below. The \"ingredients\" approachThe \"ingredients\" approach involves translating the general description ofwhatever programme is to be costed into specific resource requirements. To dothis, you should list in detail the number and types of staff, the number and typesof vehicles, the quantity and types of drugs, and so forth. Calculate the cost foreach item by multiplying the quantity by the price, and then add up all theindividual costs.For the whole programme (or for each identified activity of the programme)you would prepare a detailed list of all the resources required, the quantities ofeach resource, the unit price, and (for capital items) the expected life of the item.For each year of the proposed programme (at least five years for a long-termprogramme), you would fill in the details of resource requirements as indicated inthe table below, to which details for all the \"ingredients\" of each input categorymust be added.Consider the \"ingredients- approach further by doing exercise 10A, page 136.The \"ingredients\" approach requires a thorough understanding of the re-sources required for a new project. Specifying the details of planned projectimplementation can be a Very useful exercise for the good design and manage-ment of programmes. For this reason, it is recommended that you start by usingthe \"ingredients\" approach when estimating future costs.This approach is particularly appropriate to use when:the programme to be costed is new or rapidly changing, and existingprogramme costs may not provide a reliable guide;87 MODULE 10. FUTURE COSTS El Cost estimation for long-term budget preparation year_ InputDescriptionQuantityPriceUseful lifeAnnualization lar;lor10 for all roomer)! COSTS the available cost data are incomplete or unreliable, and it is feasible todocument the resources required in some detail.Unfortunately, for many health projects detailed resource requirements aredifficult to predict. Losses of supplies will occur to a greater or lesser extent,affecting the full cost of delivering the planned services. The combination or mixof personnel employed, even at the basic delivery unit level, may change overtime in unexpected ways. (The substitution of a community health worker for a USING COST DATA IN PLANNING physician or nurse for certain tasks is a case in point.) The ratio of labour toequipment or other resources may be equally unpredictable.Perhaps not surprisingly, estimates of future costs that rely on itemizingresources tend to focus on the items of large cost (mostly capital items, which arediscussed in earlier modules). Much less attention is likely to be paid toestimating recurrent costs. This is unfortunate for several reasons:The items classified under recurrent costs, although often of low individualvalue, are frequently purchased in large amounts and thus can contributesignificantly to overall costs.Inadequate funding for recurrent costs is likely to jeopardize the effec-tiveness of the whole programme. Recurrent items are often comple-mentary to capital inputs. Many capital items, such as vehicles andequipment, will not function adequately without, for example, fuel orpower or maintenance.Recurrent costs are usually borne by recipient governments in developingcountries, even when outside donors provide capital items such asequipment or vehicles, and the government is likely to have limitedflexibili;:y to provide more resources if the initial budget is incorrect.Because detailed documentation of resources is tedious (particularly forrecurrent costs) and there is a danger that some costs will be left out, a secondapproach, described below, has some advantages.The \"adaptation\" approachThis second approach to prediction involves using your experience of what acertain kind of programme actually costs to estimate what a similar programmeplanned for the future might cost. This has the advantage of accommodating notonly obvious recurrent costs but also wastage and other costs which might easilybe overlooked in the \"ingredients\" approach. This second method shares with thefirst the difficulty of allowing for changes in the proportions of resource inputsemployed, but it has some advantages.The \"adaptation\" approach involves the following steps:Select a programme that (a) is as similar as possible to the planned one; (b)operates as rationally and efficiently as the planned one is likely to; (c) hasaccessible cost data.Estimate the costs of that programme, using Modules 4and7as guides ormaking use of available estimates.Adjust your estimates to take into account any known differences betweenthe programme costed and the planned programme.One of the major challenges is to know how to modify appropriately the costdata you have. One important difference that is likely to exist between the costed89 MODULE 10. FUTURE COSTS programme and the one you are planning is size Total costs are likely to bemisleading in this case. As a first approximation, you will need to know unitcosts, such as total cost per contact, per facility and per district. Which of these ismost relevant will depend on the aspects of the costed (current or past)programme you are going to reproduce. For example, if you are establishingsimilar health centres in another area, you might use cost per facility (andmultiply this by the number of planned new facilities to get the total future costestimate). If you are expanding the catchment areas of existing facilities, cost percontact would be more appropriate. If you are establishing a similar programmein a new district, cost per district may be the most useful guide, assuming areasonable similarity between the two populations served in terms of size anddemographic structure.Often, you will have to make adjustments to take into account the existinginfrastructure. For example, your planned programme may not need additionalbuildings, but the cost data available might include building costs. In that case, ifpossible, you would eliminate building costs from the estimates. In other words,for budgetary purposes you do not want the average total cost of the existingprogramme, but the average additional or incremental costs of the new one.Even if it is difficult to find programmes that are very similar to the plannedone, you may be able to make use of sc.,me parts of existing cost estimates. Inparticular, you should use available cost data to help estimate the likely recurrentcosts associated with capital investments. Usually, it is relatively easy to workout what capital inputs your new programme requires (using the \"ingredients\"approach), foi example the number of vehicles and the number of refrigerators.You could then use available cost data on the relationship between capital inputsand their recurrent costs (the \"adaptation\" approach). You could look at therecurrent. cost for each capital item. For example, expenditure data for existingprogrammes could give you an estimate of the average annual cost of running avehicle (i.e. the operation and maintenance cost per vehicle). This could save youthe difficult (and probably unreliable) exercise of attempting to document all thedifferent running costs a vehicle islikely to have (fuel,oil,spare parts,registration, insurance). Your existing cost data may show you that, on average,it costs about $800a year to operate a vehicle, and you could apply this estimateto your future programme.Even with such information, you should not assume that it is appropriate toapply costs from one situation directly to another. For example, the running costsfor a vehicle in a city are likely to be very different from those for the samevehicle used on poorly maintained rural roads. Or maintenance might have beeninadequately funded. Fortunately, it is usually easier to understand the factorsthat influence the value of a specific category of costs than it is to understandthose that influence totalcosts, so that you can often make appropriateadjustments. 13:1 USING COST DATA IN PLANNING In general, use the \"adaptation\" approach when:the programmes for which cost data are available are broadly representa-tive of the planned programmes;the programmes costed have been adequately funded and have functionedefficiently (check, for example, that supplies of fuel and drugs have beenadequate);costs for existing programmes can be reasonably readily obtained (i.e.more easily than documenting resource requirements in detail as in the\"ingredients\" approach). The \"mark-up\" approachFor programmes that are already under way, a third, and very common, way ofestimating future costs is simply to add a certain percentage to cost estimatesfrom the recent pasta kind of \"mark-up\" of past values. This might be anarbitrary percentage, perhaps just taking into account expected inflation.The danger with this approach is that it assumes that the programme has beenadequate inthe past, and discourages consideration of new initiatives ormodifications. It also depends on reasonably accurate past cost estimates for theprogramme. However, a very detailed estimate of future costs will not be neededevery year. Once a programme has been initiated, it is often necessary only to:determine current and recent costs of the programme (i.e. take stock);modify these estimates to reflect general cost trends, e.g. by using officialprice indexes, and allow for demographic changes, health service develop-ments and any special problems expected to arise;check annually that expenditure is in line with the budgets, and adjust thebudget if necessary;prepare a detailed budget to incorporate any new items into the pro-gramme. How to use future cost estimates for decision-makingAssuming that you have used one or a combination of the three approachesoutlined above to estimate future costs, you are ready to go on to use theinformation. The uses of cost estimates for possible future activities are essen-tially the same as those for existing programmes, described in the Introductionand Module 2 to compare costs with available resources and measure efficiency,equity and priorities. But there is one crucial difference, which stems from the factthat, if information is going to he useful for decision-making, it has to saysomething about the future. (This point was made briefly in Module 2, in thesection entitled \"Making cost projections\", page 16.)91 MODULE 10: FUTURE COSTS Retrospective costings can help to determine how appropriate previousdecisions were (in other words, were past programmes affordable, efficient andequitable?). However, they are limited in how much they can tell us about whatshould be done to improve a situation. They may highlight possible problems andareas to focus attention on (e.g. by showing where most resources are currentlyspent), but they cannot give any firm guidelines about appropriate modifications.Much of their value will depend on what they can tell us about activities thathave not yet been implemented. Retrospective cost calculations should be madewith one eye on the future, for their relevance to new or revised programmes.Good information on the past, whatever the verdict it suggests on previousprogrammes, can be helpful for the things to come in the health systemat thelevel of the community as well as nationally.A decision to invest resources in a new programme will be based on manyconsiderations. As part of the decision-making process, you can use projectionsof costs to help to answer two crucial questions: (1) Is the programme affordable?and(2)Is it likely to be efficient? AffordabilityA health programme is affordable if, and only if, each of the parties who mustcontribute to financing its operation is able and willing to do so, both at theoutset and later on. To analyse affordability, financial costs matter more thaneconomic ones (although changes in patterns of support may blur that distinc-tion).If the total finances required to implement a programme are not availablewhen needed, the programme's effectiveness will be reduced, sometimes serious-ly. Imagine a hospital whose construction is complete but where there are nofunds for staff:itis practically useless. It is very important to make sure inadvance that finances will be available to implement the programme well.Nothing in the future can ever be certain, of course, but at least you should have areasonable expectation of finding the funds for whatever new development orexpansion is planned before you start.Make a good estimate of the expected additional financial costs of yourproposed programme--that is, its budgetfor a period of up to ten years. Ifpossible, use the input categories suggested throughout this manual, adaptingthem where necessary to the standard budgetary format of your organization.Pay particular attention to recurrent costs, which you will need to keep underconstant control. Nonrecurrent costs cannot be avoided, either, owing to theneed for replacement. You must not forget that the recurrent cost burden oftenchanges when an old capital item is replaced by a new one. For all categories ofcosts, distinguish in your budget between financing in cash and resources likelyto be donated in kind (e.g. vaccines supplied and paid for by external agencies). /7 USING COST DATA IN PLANNING Certain adjustments, e.g. for inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates, canbe incorporated in the budget process (in addition to the customary contingencyallowances), especially at higher levels of care. This can also be done at lowerlevels, provided that appropriate technical advice is readily available. For onething, a budget will need to make allowances for inflation. This is whereeconomic specialists can be useful. No one can be sure of the future, but expertscan probably help you to go beyond simple extrapolations of past price increaseswhen building inflation allowances into your budget.Even more technicaland more likely to be determined at national level--arematters involving foreign exchange. For each year of your budget, you shouldtry to separate local currency from foreign currency requirements for financinginputs. It is necessary to make this distinction for a number of reasons:In some countries, access to foreign exchange may be limited (i.e. thebudget constraint is more severe), so separate planning is .needed.Foreign exchange rates vary over time. This will affect the amount of localcurrency needed to purchase foreign exchange inputs. For each year,identify which resources requiring foreign exchange will be paid for locally,and calculate each cost in local currency, using a range of estimates of likelyforeign exchange rates. (Recent rates can be found in the periodicalInternational financial statistics, published by the International MonetaryFund, but you should not hesitate to seek assistance from local specialistswhen necessary.)Estimates of future costs, especially those made at higher levels whereeconomic and other information is more complete, may include special data onthe source of funds and the form of resources provided. In such cases, it will beuseful to listall possible sources of finance (Ministry of Health and othergovernment bodies, consumers, donors) and how much each is likely to provide.Prepare a separate sub-budget for each major contributor, and indicate how firmtheir commitment is. Comment on the consequences of any failure to providespecified resources. In particular, consider how likely itis that donors willcontinue to provide the same level of funding in the long term. Look at trends inexpenditure in previous years and at the donor's previous practice, if known.What alternative sources are there if the current donors do not continue tosupport the programme? Calculate the proportion of costs borne by donors toobtain some indication of the likelihood of the programme becoming unafford-able.Suppose that your calculations and projections suggest that insufficient fundswill he available for the programme. If that problem is still evident after you havechecked the numbers, you will have three basic choices:Modify the design of the new or revised programme. Are there ways to make.the original design more efficient? Can you operate on a smaller scale?-03 MODULE 10. FUTURE COSTS Find additional sources of finance. Look first at the national financing systemto see whether allocations could be increased. Then, consider bilateral orinternational assistance (from either governments or nongovernmentalorganizations). If you are involved in a major new programme, it may benecessary to consider user fees or other ways to tap more directly intoavailable local resources.Reject the programme design and consider alternative strategies.You should avoid submitting a proposal that would cost more than thecurrently available funds. Administrators unfamiliar with your programme maysimply reduce some components arbitrarily. For example, with a proposal for anessential drugs programme that costs twice the funds available, the quantities ofall drugs may simply be halved. Since not all drugs are of equal importance, a farbetter approach would be to submit a new drug list in keeping with the availablefinal-, 2s, which provides for cuts in less essential drugs first, and in more essentialones only as a last resort., EfficiencyA second important use for estimates of future costs is to select help you to selectthe most cost-effective solution from the ones that are financially affordable. Forthis judgement of efficiency, economic costs (see Module 7) should usually be used.Cost-effectiveness analysis (see Module 9) is one useful approach for identify-ing the most efficient options. The only difference in methodology whenconsidering future programmes is that, instead of calculating cost-effectivenessfor one particular year, you can determine the average over the life of theprogramme, or at least over several years. Because of the variable life of capitalitems and the importance of time in estimating value, the procedure ofdiscounting is used to express all costs (and effects) in their equivalent values forthe present year. (When a proper discount rate is used in assessing efficiency, itwill not be necessary to make adjustments for inflation.)The procedure for discounting is as follows. Choose a base year (say, the firstyear of the proposed programme). The value of items, including capital items,purchased in that year remains unchanged. However, the real value of goodspurchased in the second year must be discounted by a relevant discount rate(similar to the process described in Module 7). If the discount rate is 10%, $ 1000spent in year 2 is equivalent to $ 910 in year 1 ($ 1000/(1 + 0.10)). Goodspurchased in the third year are discounted a further 10%, and so on. Thecalculation is essentially the reverse of calculating compound interest. The resultof this process is to yield a single \"present value\" figure for all costs (and effects).Just as for annualized capital costs, as explained in Module 7, there are standardtables of the factors needed to do the discounting. No such calculation is requiredat this point in the manual. USING COST DATA IN PLANNING As noted above, you will be looking for economic costs in most analyses ofefficiency. As a rough guide to calculating these completely, consider thefollowing guidelines:Take the financial costs, and add your estimates of the value of theadditional resources that will not require financing, such as the cashequivalents (per year) of existing capital items and of donated resources.Estimate the value of resources diverted to your purposes from otherproductive activities (for example, staff who are already employed andwho will be asked to give up some other responsibilities to work on yourproject).Consider the appropriateness of the prices that you have used to calculatewages, and consider the probable value of foreign exchange as it will affectcertain inputs, making any necessary adjustments to your preliminary costestimates.Although the assessment of health programme efficiency in planning for thefuture may seem rather complicated from the description given here, it is oftenfeasible and well worth the effort required, because it will allow better health carefrom a given budget. Exercise 10B, page 136, offers a further insight into some ofthe essential ideas. 5 Financial analysis This module briefly reviews some important applications of cost data in financialanalysis, using existing and projected values of the costs and effects of primaryhealth care. Some of the information given here expands on that given in earliermodules.Naturally, the possible applications of cost data will depend on the availabilityof sufficient data and the reliability of those data, which, in turn, depend on themethods of collection and interpretation of information. Other severe constraintsinclude the time and funds available to explore applications.The data and applications discussed here will be of interest mainly to higher-level health officials. However, planning below the national level is an importantsubject for the manual as a whole, so we have included some brief reminders herefor district-level personnel. You will recall the coverage in Module 2 ofcomparisons between expected budget and actual expendib Ire, which requirefrequent application in every programme at every level. You could refer to table2.1, page 18, with its associated questions and to exercises 2A and 2D(b). Alsoimportant to district health officials and others serving at levels below the centralone is the projection of available information into the future for budgetary andother purposes. (See the explanations, examples and exercises in Module 10.)This module reviews and e:-'ends the applications of analyses of cost and cost-effectiveness to the following topics: differences between various levels of thehealth system; equity; affordability; and cost recovery Applications at different levels of the health systemThe cost data available to health personnel will necessarily vary somewhat bylevel. Some of the variability is obvious. For example, only national officials are ina position to know central office costs (not to mention the many sources offinance, including external assistance). Local officials, on the other hand, are in thebest position to know about staffing ratios, while the people actually deliveringservices in facilities may be the only ones aware of any difference between thetime allocated for certain tasks and that actually worked by staff members.Equally, information on the effects of health care will vary by level. Asexplained in Modules 5 and 9, there are many measures of effectiveness. Localpersonnel will usually have access to primary data on service outputs and perhapsto changes in the attitudes and behaviour of patients. At the other extreme, ifhealth status outcomes can be estimated at all, it will very likely be only throughefforts made at national (or perhaps regional) level. USING COST DATA IN PLANNING Thus, cost-effectiveness studies may differ between levels, or require coopera-tion throughout the health system. Both the uses of such studies and theimplications of results for further research are described in detail in Module 9. Itshould be evident in your work which kinds of studies of costs and cost-effectiveness will be feasible for district-level planning and administration. EquityEquity in health service delivery (who receives care 7) and in the financing of care(who pays for it 7) is a vital objective. Its general relation to cost analysis has beendescribed briefly in Modules 2, 7 and 8.While there can be little dispute over the desirability of an equitable healthsystem, securing enough information on equity to be able to influence policiesand practices is not easy. The widespread need for more and better health care inmost developing countries justifies attempts to try to identify both those whoreceive care and those who pay for it, distinguishing between them in terms ofeconomic status, sex, geographical location and so forth. There are variouspossible measures of equityreferring, for instance, to availability and use ofservices (including use in relation to the need for care)and most of these requiredata derived from households. It is necessary to find out who does not receivecare as well as who does, and to determine the characteristics of users andnon-users. Unfortunately, household data are often not available and are difficultto obtain, as explained in Module 8.You can, however, try to find (or collect) and put to use information on targetpopulations and on expenditure made by and for them to obtain health care. Twoaspects of such efforts are explored in exercises ITA and IIB, page 139, whichextend earlier exercises. Try them before moving on to the next section. AffordabilityAffordability was discussed in Module 10. To build on the information giventhere, do exercise 11C, page 140. Cost recoveryIn Module 10, we noted that, if a programme is not affordable, health officialshave three basic options: (1) to modify the programme; (2) to find additionalsources of funds; (3) to reject the programme and turn to other strategies. Thesecond of these choices often involves recovering programme costs, throughvarious possible means, such as user charges (fees). Decisions on such changes areusually made at the highest level of the system, but health personnel at all levelswill be concerned with the policies and especially the ways in which they are MODULE 11: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS administered (Details of collecting and spending fees are beyond the scope ofthis manual.)Some guidelines on cost recovery, including user charges, are provided inModule 2, which raises the important point of possible problems connected withpatients' ability to pay leading to potential threats to equity. Module 8 developsthat theme and notes the difficulties of obtaining information for an adequateassessment of abilityas well as willingnessto pay for care. It is worth lookingagain at exerci,.,2 8B, page 130, as you complete this brief review of cost recoveryapplications in financial analysis. 90 USING COST DATA IN PLANNING )1110DULE,.:1Managerial efficiency The use of cost findings to assess the efficiency of health service delivery hasbeen covered in Modules 2, 6, 7 and 9. Here, these approaches to improving theefficiency of delivery units are developed further for consideration by facilitymanagers and their superviscrs.To achieve greater efficiency, especially at the community level, it is necessaryto investigate how total and unit costs differ among facilities at a given time, andhow they vary for the same facility over time. Analysing these costs to find thefactors that affect them is not easy, especially when concepts such as quality ofcare and the possible effects of population characteristics and geographicalvariables are taken ;nto account. Nevertheless, major cost differences at \"outliers\"(sites that stand out at one extreme or the other) can be particularly worthy ofinvestigation. What total cost profiles reveal about efficiencyAs explained in Module 2, the total cost of a programme or of certain activities ata particular delivery facility is often broken down into its separate components toshow resource inputs. Each category of input can be expressed as a monetaryvalue and as a percentage of the total. Lessons may be learned from the profile ofcosts over time orprobably more usefulwhen there are differences betweensites. The large cost category of personnel is worth examining for unusualpercentage values, and drugs and vehicles are categories where notable differ-ences are often to be found. If one health centre in a district or region stands outbecause of its very high drug costs, for example, it should be examined further byits manager and supervisors (as explained in Module 2). Studies of PHC costs atthe local level in many countries have revealed considerable variations in the useof pharmaceuticals and in their cost per patient contact, leading in some cases toreviews of drug supply and prescribing practices.Another illustration of the efficiency \"messages\" conveyed by cost data is asituation where an unexpectedly high share of total costs in an immunizationprogramme is found to be attributable to purchase of vaccines. High wastagerates might be involved; this must be determined by closer inspection of theprogramme.For a major PHC programme, the nationwide profiles of two similar Africancountries showed a considerable difference in the personnel percentages of thecost profiles. This led to a consideration of various possible explanations. In thisase, different rates of pay for staff appeared to be a major factor, while noSJ MODULE 12: MANAGERIAL. EFFICIENCY m differences either in the total number employed or in staffing ratios (e.g. the ratioof physicians to nurses) were evident. (Conversely, studies in other countrieshave found major differences in staffing ratios across health centres.) These costfactors and others are considered further in the following section.Some important influences on average costs and their implicationsfor efficiencyWhat are the most common factors affecting total and, more importantly,average costs? Identifying these can provide useful lessons for improving healthprogramme efficiency. Briefly, it might be worth examining average costs to learnwhether any of the following appears to have had a significant influence:prices paid for inputs;staffing ratios;staff productivity;intensity of use of a facility (volume of care in relation to capacity);economies of scale (cost savings from a larger capacity of the facility);economies of scope (cost savings from a greater diversity of services).The possible importance of some of these factors does not require muchexplanation here. For example, it is clear that, if input prices can be controlledwithout reduction in quality, the efficiency of service delivery will be higher. Dataon most such 'prices are likely to be readily available. As another example, staffingratios, e.g. the ratio of physicians to nurses or of registered nurses to aides canaffect the cost per unit of service at a facility. Examining the ratios for differentfacilities may reveal some unusual patterns that have inflated costs; if so, theremay be opportunities for increasing efficiency by changing the ratios. Of course,your ability to do this will depend on whether or not the health system offersyou sufficient flexibility in handling staffing. Opportunities to make such changesmay be greater in hospitals than at primary care sites.Staff productivity inevitably affects the average cost of services, and hence theefficiency of providing them. Other things being equal, when a staff member (e.g.a nurse) generates a higher output per day (e.g. makes more home visits), the unitcost falls. Of course, there can be counteracting influences. The nurse's productiv-ity may rise because there are additional supporting personnel and equipment inthe centre. The overall effect on average cost is unpredictable, and would have tobe checked. In a Latin American cost study, two different PHC programmes werecompared; one showed an appreciably lower cost per visit than the other did forseemingly comparable patients. Inspection of the data showed that the morecost-effective programme actually had lower productivity indicating a need tosearch for other explanations for cost differences.The intensity of use of a health care facility, that is, the volume of serviceprovided in relation to the facility's full capacity, is a logical cost determinant; for 123 USING COST DATA IN PLANNING a higher volume (or percentage of capacity used), fixed costs are spread overmore output, reducing the cost per unit of service. This has been demonstrated ina variety of PHC programmes, so it is worth considering whenever cost resultsare being interpreted to assess efficiency. If you find much unused capacity insome or all of the facilities of your programme, you may want to re-examine thenumber and location of delivery sites and the frequency of treatment sessions.You may very well have heard someone attribute a local delivery site'scomparatively low average costs to \"economies of scale\". An economist woulduse this term to mean that larger facilities can produce services at lower unit cost.This is plausible, but it is not always true: there is such a thing as being too largefor good managerial control. If you have enough information, you could try tocompare the average costs of facilities of different size (assuming comparableintensities of use) for certain services. To show the need for caution in expectingeconomies of scale, one study of the national immunization programmes in twodeveloping countries found that smaller facilities in both appeared to have lowercosts per dose of vaccine administered.A final cost factor suggested here for your consideration is \"economy ofscope\". It refers to possible savings in average costs from providing a widerrange of different services at the same facility, i.e. other things being equal, ahealth centre that provides a large number of different types of services canproduce each of them at lower unit cost. Among the explanations is the moreefficient use of the centre's administration, building and other facilities, whichreduces the overhead costs of each service. Some, but not all, studies looking ateconomies of scope, e.g. the one in Latin America cited above, have found them.Where data and time permit, it may be worth while to test the possible gains inefficiency from providing a wider range of services. ConclusionExercise 12A, page 141, which applies some of the above ideas, completes thismodule. We hope that the discussion here has shown you the potential value ofcertain specific steps to assess and promote efficiency in health service delivery.This use of cost analysis can complement other uses, such as planning andbudgeting.You should by now be familiar with the basic concepts of cost analysisincluding financial cost, economic cost and effectivenessas well as with themost important ways of making the appropriate measurements. You are nowready to apply these concepts in the evaluation of programmes and facilities inyour own country. EXERCISES m Some notes on computations For many of the exercises in the following pages, you will need to do somecomputations. You may need to calculate, for example, various components ofcosts and to add them together to arrive at totals for a health programme orservice delivery facility. You will also have to do some basic cost-effectivenesscalculations to decide, for example, the cost per death prevented by immuniz-ations. Some of this computationa! work may seem very detailed, but themathematics involved is straightforward. You will find it helpful to use a handcalculator to do some of the exercises.The question of using computers is bound to come up. For this type of costanalysis, a computer is not required. Anyone who has experience with personalcomputers and spreadsheet programmes will see places where they could beused, and they could in the long run be very productive. However, this manualhas been designed to be used without such aids.When you come to do actual analyses of your programme or facility, feel freeto use any computational aids that are available to you. Perhaps you or a memberof your staff will use a spreadsheet programme on a personal computer at thattime. It will be important to share your experiences of different computationalapproaches, so that others too can learn about further applications of costanalysis. 111 COST ANALYSIS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE 0 1111Exercise 1A (time: 10 minutes)List the different categories of resource inputs that you see in the picture. 47:; Y.O.hi HEAL, What other categories of inputs exist for typical PHC programmes?

Data on household and Its healthcontactsFrequentattendersInfrequentattenders Average distance to government facility (km) 5 17.5Average distance to closest nongovernment facility (km) 1C9.9Average waiting time at last government clinic visit (min) 4863Average fee paid at government clinic 0.10.12Average amount spent on drugs related to last visit 1.81 7Average no of rooms in house 1.41.2Average annual no,:sehold income 243198Average no of persons in household 6.86.6 From the survey information, what factors appear to be most important indeterringutilization? EXERCISES If average speed of travel is 5 km per hour, what are the approximate time costsper visit to the government facility, for each group? (Remember that each patientmust make both an outward and a return journey. Ignore for the moment therelatives or other persons who accompany patients, even though this will meanthat you underestimate the total household travel time.)Frequent attenders:Infrequent attenders: What costs to the households cannot be calculated from the above information? What percentage of household income would actually be spent on health servicesif each household member made two visits to the nearest government healthfacility each year? In your opinion, are these services affordable? Why, or whynot?Percentage of income spent: Affordable? Why? COST IN CARE XEliGIBESOPR MODULE .%Exercise 9A (time: 20 minutes)What are the principal objectives of your programme? Are there any specific aspects of the programme over which you have control?What are they? Indicate the main objectives of each. Aspect Objectives Write down three problems that exist in your programme. Re-express eachproblem as a desired objective. Problem Objective Exercise 9B (time: 20 minutes)Select one of the problems in your programme that you identified in exercise 9A.Identify up to five different solutions to help you meet the objective. Beimaginative. EXERCISES The problem: Possible solutions: Which of these solutions are likely to survive testing against the four pointsabout eliminating options listed on pages 69 -70? Exercise 9C (time: 20 minutes)You discover that someone in another country is running a similar programme toyours, namely educating mothers delivering in hospital with the objective ofincreasing rates of breast-feeding. You wish to compare the two programmes. Foreach hospital you measure the costs and estimate the number of additionalwomen breast-feeding. You find that in the first hospital costs are $1.00 perwoman breast-feeding (who would not otherwise have breast-fed) and in thesecond hospital costs are $0.50.What could he the causes of this difference? Structure your answer to considerthese factors: (i) educational technique; (ii) prices; (iii) hospital size; (iv) character-istics of women; (v) other factors. For each cause, state whether you couldinfluence it. Factor Can you influence it? 1 4 3 COST ANALYSIS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE a Exercise 9D (time: 30 minutes)Two methods have been identified for administration of tetanus toxoid. Toxoidcan be given routinely, as part of the regular prenatal care activities of the MCHclinic, or special campaigns can be mounted occasionally with mobile unitsaiming to immunize all eligible women in the district.The costs and some indicators of effectiveness for the two methods are given inthe table below. Cost item receiving at least two doses 800010000Estimated reduction in number of deaths from neonatal 4050tetanus Which one of the effectiveness measures is most useful, and why? Using the measure chosen for its usefulness, what are the cost-effectiveness ratiosfor the two methods (routine and campaign), and which method would beselected on the basis of that ratio? Show your calculations. What considerations have been ignored in this calculation? 144 EXERCISES cm You are not sure about the cost of vaccine in the \"campaign\" option, because it isnot currently in operation and you are not sure about relative wastage rates.They could be as much as double, or as little as half of the expected rates. Doesthis make any difference to the cost-effectiveness conclusions? Show anycalculations. What factors appear to be responsible for the difference in cost-effectivenessbetween the two methods? Does this suggest any possible modifications to thedesigns of the methods? Factors: Any modifications: 4 COST ANALYSIS PRIMARY HEALTH CARE ..1--ExERtIos::Foft.:1 optILEExercise 10A (time: 15 minutes)What are the principal difficulties that you can foresee in the \"ingredients\"approach (see page 78)? In view of the probable strengths and weaknesses of the approach, in which casesdo you think it would be most appropriate to use it? If you had to list all the resources that you expected to use over the next year fora programme (regardless of the approach you might use for cost estimation forbudget-making), which categories of resource inputs would be most difficult toquantify? IIIExercise 10B (time: 1 hour 15 minutes)A new training programme for community health workers (CHWs) is proposedin your district. It is planned to train 20 workers a year. Make a list of the inputsthat will be required. Indicate the ones for which it will be difficult to makeestimates in advance. 1 4 6j EXERCISES cm Suppose you have the following information from a neighbouring district whichhas already started its training programme (the costs apply to the previous year).It is training 30 CHWs per year. Costs include allocations of shared costs. Inputs Costs (local currency) CapitalVehicles 600Equipment 180Building space 100RecurrentPersonnel 1400Supplies 300Vehicles. operation 380Building. operation 20Other operating inputs 150 Use these costs to estimate the costs of your programme for the next five years.Remember to include only those costs that are incremental, and to take accountof the different sizes of the two programmes. Assume that inflation will be 10%per year. Use your answers to fill in the table below, and show all calculations. Inputs Year 1Year inputs 147 COST ANALYSIS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CalculationsThe government estimate for training CHWs is $1500 per district per year. Isyour proposal affordable? If it is not affordable, what suggestions could youmake? Is it affordable?L_ YesL No Show your calculation. Suggestions (if necessary): Calculate the cost per CHW trained during the first year of the new programmein your district. What other measures of effectiveness might you use for this programme? 143 EXERCISES 113 III Exercise 11A (time: 30 minutes)Refer back to exercise 2C. Assuming for your programme that you found somedifference between rural and urban area groups in your population with respectto annual expenditure per person, what does that tell you about the geographicalequity of the programme? What other important measures of programme equity would you want to use,and how readily available are the data on each?Measure of equity Availability of data CI Exercise 118 (time: 30 minutes)Refer to exercise10B.What, if anything, do your results concerning cost perCHW trained suggest about the equity of the training scheme? Identify the most useful specific kinds of information that you would need inorder to evaluate thoroughly the training scheme's equity and state very brieflywhy each is needed. (To help you: among other things, consider what happensafter the training is over.) 14 3 '140 COST ANALYSIS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE NilExercise 11C (time: 30 minutes)In exercise 1013, you were told that the government had estimated its capacity toafford the training scheme for CHWs at $1500 per district per annum.Briefly summarize the major elements that probably went into making. thatestimate. What, if anything, could you do at the districtlevel to help to make the trainingmore affordable? 150 EXERCISES Exercise 12A (time: 30 minutes)An economic study of the immunization programme in a country showed thefollowing results for the average cost per vaccine dose and the average numberof immunizations per session at five comparable delivery facilities. (More siteswere studied, but are omitted here to keep the exercise short. Assume that theirresults would not change the overall results.)

On the basis of these results (assuming that they really come from mally typicalfacilities), what might be one or two policy implications for deployment of staff(e.g. where they are placed and when they are used)? Suppose that someone recommends to you that yOu should provide immuniz-ation services in fewer but larger PHC facilities in your country in order topromote efficiency. What might be some of the major positive and negativefactors that you would explore when considering that policy recommendation? 659 11 690 10 828 10 /8 14 324 13 134 12 085 11 158 10 336 9 6048 950 8.3657 8397 3666.9386.5506.1985.8775.5845.3165.0704 8432018 046 16 35114 877 13 590 12 462 11 470 10 594 13.163 12 042 11 1494.9092320 456 18 292 857 13.489 12 303 11 272 10 2667 7187.2306 7926 243 18 914 16 936 15 24/ 13 799 12 550 11 469 10 529 8 9858 14 094 12 783 10 9 929 9.1618 4887 8967.3726 9066.4916.1185.7835.4805.2064.956223 70/ 18 32/ 16 330 14 643 13.211 11 987 10 935 10 027 9 237 8.5487.9437 4096.9356.5146 1365 7985.4925 2154.9647824 316 21 281 18 764 16 663 14 898 13 406 12 137 11 051 10 116 9 307 8 6027 9847 4416.9616.5346 1525 8105.5025 2234.9702925 116621 844 19 188 16 984 15 141 13 59112 278 11 158 10 198 9 600 17 292 15 372 13.765 12 409 11 258 10 274 9.427 8 6948 0557.4967 0036 5666.1775.8295.5175.2354.979 BEST COPY AVAILABLEEl 153 Further reading Guidelines and methodsEPICOST software for costing an immunization programme.
