It helps sharpen your concentration and mental clarity when your mind is feeling dull. The purpose is to provide equal amount of oxygen to both side of your brain. The class continues with Jill's YogaNidra Meditation with intention. Jill focuses on the use of colour as each colour represents a different Shakra Chakra Colors: Ultimate Guide to 7 Chakras and Their Meanings Source: [Colour Psychology](https://www.colorpsychology.org/chakra-colors/) Jill's 10 Foundational Key Principals THE FLOW: The aim in all of this is to allow the body and mind to be balanced and move freely with breath, control and precision so that the muscles and joints move with even rhythm. FOCUS: The focus is on you the individual. A great way to start YogaPilates Fusion is to take a moment with your eyes closed to tap into how you feel right now, and imagine yourself feeling beautifully balanced, standing tall, and realising your strength and focus through your practice of YogaPilates Fusion. BREATHE: Consider your breath to be a \"moving meditation.\" It is a beautiful thing when you move your body, flowing from one exercise to the next breathing deeply with your focus on moving through your life with a balanced body and mind. BALANCE: Balance is achieved by focusing on the breath while maintaining the correct posture and spinal alignment. The movements in the YogaPilates Fusion program will connect and balance your left and right brain to enable your body and mind to flow in a balanced way moving forward. MOBILISATION: Mobilisation is achieved through the regular movement of the spine through up and down motion as well as side to side, forward to back, and rotations. CORE: When the core is activated movement becomes dynamic as well as being controlled and precise. Activation of the pelvic floor muscles and deep abdominal muscles are the key to achieving stability through movement. CARDIO: Cardio work increases your heart rate and promotes blood flow throughout your body. It will make your heart strong, increase your lung capacity, and reduce your risk of things like heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. It will also help with weight loss if that is something you a looking to achieve. STRENGTH: When you lift weights, work out on machines, use resistance bands, or do exercises with your own body weight, you will build strength, muscle mass, and flexibility. Muscle loss is one of the main reasons people feel less stable and energetic as they get older. Building strength is key to my pro-aging approach to everything that I do. STRETCH: Actively moving through this series of YogaPilates Fusion exercises will stretch as well as strengthen your muscles, tendons and ligaments. These hold your bones together and are critical to mobility and flexibility. MEDITATION/RELAXATION/INTENTION: Yoga Nidra is also known as the waking sleep. It can totally change the way you feel physically and emotionally, and it perfectly completes the balance of the mind and the body that is at the core of the YogaPilates Fusion\u00ae method. "}
