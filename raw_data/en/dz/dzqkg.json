The Bow Valley is home to so many active people, and several studies have shown that prolonged heavy training and intense exercise can compromise the immune system and cause a suppression of IgA antibodies. What is this IgA antibody you speak of? Salivary immunoglobulin A is the predominant antibody that plays a crucial role in immune function. It's found in saliva, tears, and other mucosal fluids and is known as our first line of defense against various toxins and viruses. When IgA levels are high we can easily ward off the common cold and flu. Acupuncture and Cupping to Boost Immune Function Studies in Japan on elite female soccer players showed that regular acupuncture enhanced the Salivary IgA secretion by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system. These increased levels of Salivary IgA reduce the likelihood of contracting a viral infection, keeping you sick free! Cupping therapy is another great method to boost the immune system. The lifting action of cupping encourages lymphatic drainage within our lymph system. Our lymphatic systems main function is to transport lymph and white blood cells (protect the body against infections) throughout the body. The process of cupping supports the immune systems functions by aiding the white blood cells to destroy and absorb pathogenic substances and protect our body.
