Young children are naturally eager to learn. However, not all of them are ready for school. All too often, children entering school for the first time as kindergarten\u00aders are already lagging behind their class \u00ad mates, and this disadvantage can affect them socially and academically long past kindergarten. Children who have had the benefit of attending high-quality pr eschools are more comfortable in their surround\u00adings, have been exposed to books, have learned how to play cooperatively, and are accustomed to lear ning with others. Research shows that all children can benefit from participating in high-quality preschool pr ograms. And a recent study by the RAND Corporation shows that closing the school \"readiness\" gap will help to close the achievement gap, in which far too many socioeconomically disadvantaged students and far too many African Ameri\u00adcan and Latino children are lagging behind and achieving below their abilities. Not all preschool programs ar e equally effective, however. Those that strengthen children's school readiness operate with an in-depth understanding of what children need to learn before they start school. With a goal of ensuring that all preschools in California of fer such high- quality programs, the California Depart \u00adment of Education, during a three-year\u00ad long collaborative effort with leading early childhood educators, researchers, advocates, and parents, developed these preschool learning foundations. The foundations outline key knowledge and skills that most children can achieve when provided with the kinds of inter\u00adactions, instruction, and environments research has shown to promote early learning and development. The founda\u00adtions can provide early childhood educa\u00adtors, parents, and the public with a clear understanding of the wide range of knowl\u00adedge and skills that preschool children typically attain when given the benefits of a high-quality preschool program. These foundations focus on four domains: social-emotional development, language and literacy, English-language development, and mathematics. They provide a comprehensive understanding of what children learn in these four domains. It is my hope that these foundations will help guide and support all California preschools as they offer developmentally appropriate activities and instruction that are both purposeful and playful, instilling in our young children a love of learning that will last a lifetime.

Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Introduction Tdhe preschool learning foun\u00ad ations are a critical step in the California Department of Education's efforts to strengthen pre\u00ad school education and school readiness and to close the achievement gap in California. They describe competen\u00adcies\u2014knowledge and skills\u2014that most children can be expected to exhibit in a high-quality program as they com\u00adplete their first or second year of pre\u00adschool. In other words, the foundations describe what all young children typi\u00adcally learn with appropriate support. The support young children need to attain the competencies varies from child to child. Many children learn simply by participating in high-quality preschool programs. Such programs offer children environments and expe\u00adriences that encourage active, playful exploration and experimentation. With play as an integral part of the curricu\u00adlum, high-quality programs include purposeful teaching to help children gain knowledge and skills. In addi\u00adtion, many children in California's pre\u00adschools benefit from specific support in learning English. Other children may have a special need that requires par\u00adticular accommodations and adapta\u00adtions. To serve all children, preschool programs must work to provide appro\u00ad priate conditions for learning and individually assist each child to move along a pathway of healthy learning and development. All 50 states either have developed preschool standards documents or are in the process of doing so. Many of them have sought to align early learn\u00ading standards with their kindergar\u00adten content standards. In most cases these alignment efforts have focused on academic content areas, such as English-language arts or mathematics. In California priority has been placed on aligning expectations for preschool learning with the state's kindergar\u00adten academic content standards and complementing the content areas with attention to social-emotional devel\u00adopment and English-language devel\u00adopment. Like the learning in such domains as language and literacy and mathematics, the concepts in social-emotional development and English-language development also contrib\u00adute significantly to young children's readiness for school (From Neurons to Neighborhoods 2000; Eager to Learn 2000; Early Learning Standards 2002). Because the focus on preschool learn\u00ading in California includes the full range California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 xi xii of domains, the term \"foundations\" is used rather than \"standards.\" This term is intended to convey that learn\u00ading in every domain affects young chil\u00addren's readiness for school. The preschool learning foundations presented in this document cover the following domains: Social-Emotional Development Language and Literacy English-Language Development (for English lear ners) Mathematics T ogether, these domains represent crucial ar eas of lear ning and develop\u00ad ment for young children. The founda\u00adtions within a particular domain provide a thorough overview of devel\u00adopment in that domain. Preschool children can be considered from the perspective of one domain, such as language and literacy or social-emotional development. Yet, when taking an in-depth look at one domain, one needs to keep in mind that, for young children, learning is usually an integrated experience. For example, a young child may be concentrating on mathematical reasoning, but at the same time, there may be linguistic aspects of the experience. The foundations written for each of these domains ar e based on r esearch and evidence and are enhanced with expert practitioners' suggestions and examples. Their purpose is to promote understanding of preschool children's learning and to guide instructional practice. It is anticipated that teach\u00aders, administrators, parents, and poli\u00adcymakers will use the foundations as a springboard to augment efforts to enable all young children to acquire the competencies that will prepare them for success in school. Overview of the Foundations The strands for each of the domains discussed previously are listed in this section. Social-Emotional Development Domain. The social-emotional develop\u00ad ment domain consists of the following three strands: 1. Self, which includes self-aware\u00adness and self-regulation, social and emotional understanding, empathy and caring, and initiative in learning 2. Social Interaction, which focuses on interactions with familiar adults, interactions with peers, group participation, and coopera\u00adtion and responsibility 3. Relationships, which addresses attachments to parents, close relationships with teachers and caregivers, and friendships The competencies covered by the social-emotional development founda\u00adtions underscore the multiple ways in which young children's development in this domain influences their ability to adapt successfully to preschool and, later on, in school. Language and Literacy Domain. The language and literacy founda\u00adtions address a wide range of specific competencies that preschool children will need support to learn. These foun\u00addations focus on the following three strands: 1. Listening and Speaking, which includes language use and conventions, vocabulary, and grammar 2. Reading, which covers concepts about print, phonological aware\u00adness, alphabetics and word/print Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education xiii recognition, comprehension and analysis of age-appropriate text, and literacy interest and response 3. Writing, which focuses on writing strategies, including the emergent use of writing and writing-like behaviors The foundations that were written for this domain reflect the field's grow\u00ading interest in and understanding of the knowledge and skills that foster children's language and literacy learning during the preschool years. English-Language Development Domain. The English-language devel\u00ad opment foundations are specifically designed for children entering pre\u00adschool with a home language other than English. Some English learners will begin preschool already having had some experience with English. For other English learners, preschool will offer them their first meaningful exposure to English. No matter how much background English learners have with English before they enter preschool, they will be on a path of acquiring a second language. As the English-language development foun\u00addations indicate, the learning task for English learners is sequential and multifaceted. English learners will need support in developing knowledge and skills in the following four strands: 1. Listening, which includes understanding words, requests and directions, and basic and advanced concepts 2. Speaking, which focuses on using English to communicate needs, expand vocabulary, become skillful at engaging in conversa\u00adtions, use increasingly complex grammatical constructions when speaking, understand grammar, ask questions, use social conven\u00ad tions, and tell personal stories 3. Reading, which covers appre\u00adciating and enjoying r eading, understanding book r eading, understanding print conventions, demonstrating awareness that print conveys meaning, develop\u00ading awareness and recognition of letters, demonstrating phonologi\u00adcal awareness, and manipulating sounds, such as rhyming 4. Writing, which includes under\u00adstanding the communicative function of writing and engaging in simple writing and writing-like behaviors Unlike the three other sets of foun\u00ad dations, in which the foundations are linked to age, the English-language development foundations ar e defined by three levels of development\u2014Begin\u00adning, Middle, and Later. Depending on their prior experience with using their home language and English to commu\u00adnicate with others, preschool English learners will go through these levels at different paces. Once children reach the Later level, they will still need sup\u00adport to continue acquiring English and to apply their developing linguistic abilities in every domain. Mathematics Domain. Young childr en's development of mathemat\u00ad ics knowledge and skills is receiving increasing attention in research and practice. The mathematics foundations cover the following five strands: 1. Number Sense, which includes understanding of counting, num\u00adber relationships, and operations 2. Algebra and Functions (Classifica\u00adtion and Patter ning), which focuses on sorting and classifying objects California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 xi\u0018 and recognizing and understand\u00ad ing simple, repeating patterns 3. Measurement, which includes comparison and or dering 4. Geometry, which focuses on properties of objects (shape, size, position) and the r elation of objects in space 5. Mathematical Reasoning, which addresses how young childr en use mathematical thinking to solve everyday problems Preschool programs can promote young childr en's lear ning in this domain by encouraging children to explore and manipulate materials that engage them in mathematical think\u00ading and by introducing teacher-guided learning activities that focus on math\u00adematical concepts. Organization of the Foundations In the main body of this document, each strand is broken out into one or more substrands, and the foundations are organized under the substrands. Foundations are presented for chil\u00addren at around 48 months of age and at around 60 months of age. In some cases the difference between the foun\u00addations for 48 months and 60 months is more pronounced than for the other foundations. Even so, the founda\u00adtions focus on 48 and 60 months of age because they correspond to the end of the first and second years of preschool. Of course, teachers need to know where each child is on a contin\u00aduum of learning throughout the child's time in preschool. The Desired Results Developmental Profile-Revised (DRDP\u00adR) is a teacher observation tool that is being aligned with the foundations. The DRDP-R gives teachers a means to observe childr en's lear ning along a continuum of four developmental levels. Finally, the examples listed under each foundation give a range of pos\u00adsible ways in which childr en can dem \u00ad onstrate a foundation. The examples suggest different kinds of contexts in which children may show the compe\u00adtencies reflected in the foundations. Examples highlight that children are learning while they are engag\u00ading in imaginative play, exploring the environment and materials, making discoveries, being inventive, or inter\u00adacting with teachers or other adults. Although often illustrative of the diver\u00adsity of young children's learning expe\u00adriences, the examples listed under a foundation are not exhaustive. In fact, teachers often observe other ways in which young children demonstrate a foundation. Note: The Appendix, \"The Founda\u00ad tions,\" contains a listing of the foundations in each domain, without examples. Universal Design for Learning The California preschool learning foundations are guides to support pre\u00adschool programs in their efforts to fos\u00adter the learning and development of all young children in California, includ\u00ading children who have disabilities. In some cases, children with disabilities will need to use alternate methods for demonstrating their development. It is important to provide opportunities to follow different pathways to learn\u00ading in the preschool foundations in order to make them helpful for all of California's children. To that end, the California preschool learning founda- Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education x\u0018 tions incorporate a concept known as universal design for learning. Developed by the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST), univer\u00adsal design for learning is based on the realization that children learn in different ways (CAST 2007). In today's diverse preschool settings and programs, the use of a curriculum accessible to all learners is critical to successful early learning. Univer\u00adsal design for learning is not a single approach that will accommodate everyone; rather, it refers to provid\u00ading multiple approaches to learning in order to meet the needs of diverse learners. Universal design provides for multiple means of representation, multiple means of engagement, and multiple means of expression (CAST 2007). Multiple means of representa\u00adtion refers to providing information in a variety of ways so the learning needs of all of the children are met. Multiple means of expression refers to allowing children to use alternative methods to demonstrate what they know or what they are feeling. Multiple means of engagement refers to providing choices for activities within the setting or pro\u00adgram that facilitate learning by build\u00ading on children's interests. The examples given in the pre\u00ad school lear ning foundations have been wor ded in such a way as to incorpo\u00ad rate multiple means of receiving and expressing. This has been accom\u00adplished by the inclusion of a variety of examples for each foundation and the use of words that are inclusive rather than exclusive, as follows: The terms \"communicates\" and \"responds\" ar e often used rather than the term \"says.\" \"Com\u00admunicates\" and \"responds\" are inclusive of any language and any form of communication, includ \u00ad ing speaking, sign language, finger spelling, pictures, electronic com\u00admunication devices, eye-pointing, gesturing, and so forth. The terms \"identifies\" and \"indi\u00adcates or points to\" ar e often used to r epresent multiple means of indicating objects, people, or events in the environment. Exam\u00adples include, among other means of indicating, the use of gestures, eye-pointing, nodding, or respond\u00ading \"yes\" or \"no\" when another points to or touches an object. Teachers should read each founda\u00ad tion and the accompanying examples, then consider the means by which a child with a disability might best acquir e infor mation and demonstrate competence in these areas. A child's special education teacher, parents, or related service provider may be contacted for consultation and suggestions. The Foundations and Preschool Learning in California The foundations are at the heart of the CDE's approach to promoting preschool learning. Teachers use best practices, curricular strategies, and instructional techniques that assist children in learning the knowledge and skills described in the preschool learning foundations. The \"how to's\" of teaching young children include setting up environments, supporting children's self-initiated play, select\u00ading appropriate materials, and plan\u00adning and implementing teacher-guided learning activities. Two major con\u00adsiderations underlie the \"how to's\" of California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 x\u0018i teaching. First, teachers can effectively foster early learning by thoughtfully considering the preschool learning foundations as they plan environments and activities. And second, during every step in the planning for young children's learning, teachers have an opportunity to tap into the prominent role of play. Teachers can best support young children both by encouraging the rich learning that occurs in chil\u00addren's self-initiated play and by intro\u00adducing purposeful instructional activi\u00adties that playfully engage preschoolers in learning. Professional development is a key component in fostering pr eschool lear ning. The foundations can become a unifying element for both preservice and in-service professional develop\u00adment. Preschool program directors and teachers can use the foundations to facilitate curriculum planning and implementation. At the center of the CDE's evolving system for supporting young children during the preschool years, the foundations are designed to help teachers be intentional and focus their efforts on the knowledge and skills that all young children need to acquire for success in preschool and, later on, in school.

Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education FOUNDATIONS IN Social-Emotional Development This section describes founda- tions for the behavior of pre\u00ad school children in the domain of social-emotional development. The goal of the California Department of Education (CDE) in developing these foundations was to describe the behav\u00adiors that are typical of preschool chil\u00addren who are making good progress toward readiness for kindergarten. The research focus was, in particular, on behavior reflecting age-appropriate competency for children in the 40- to 47-month age span and children in the 52- to 59-month age span. These competencies are included as foundations for children \"at around 48 months of age\" and \"at around 60 months of age,\" respectively. In focusing on the social and emotional foundations of school readiness, a central assumption\u2014well supported by developmental and educational research\u2014was that school readiness consists of social-emotional competen\u00adcies as well as other cognitive and motivational competencies required for success in school. The foundations of social and emotional development described here\u2014including the growth of self-awareness, self-regulation, coop\u00aderation and responsibility, social and emotional understanding, empathy and caring, interactions with peers, friend\u00adship, group participation (such as in the classroom), initiative in learning, attachments to parents, close relation\u00adships with teachers and caregivers, and interactions with familiar adults\u2014 are each predictive of children's adap\u00adtation to school and their academic success. Research literature highlight\u00ading the social-emotional foundations of early school success has been pub\u00adlished, and relevant studies from that literature are cited in the bibliographic listings at the end of this section. School readiness consists of social-emotional competencies as well as other cognitive and motivational competencies required for success in school. The CDE's endeavor to describe the behaviors typical of preschool children who are on course for school readi\u00adness involved three additional assump\u00adtions. The first was the assumption that young children have access to the appropriate kinds of social interac\u00adtions, experiences, and environments that normally support healthy develop\u00adment. Young children growing up in markedly deprived settings experience California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 \u0018 \u0018 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT greater challenges to healthy develop\u00ad ment because they are more likely to lack those supports; consequently, their readiness to begin school is hin\u00addered. The second assumption was that the purpose of these foundations is to describe typical development rather than to articulate aspirational expec\u00adtations for children's behavior under the best possible conditions or for the behaviors to be instilled in children. In order for these foundations to be useful, they must describe what can typically be expected of young children growing up in conditions appropri\u00adate for healthy development. The third assumption was that these founda\u00adtions, especially the behavioral exam\u00adples for each foundation, are not meant to be assessment items; rather, they are meant to be guidelines and teaching tools. Those who use these foundations should not try to measure the chil\u00addren they observe against the specific examples included in each domain. This is because the examples given are meant to be general illustrations of the competencies described rather than essential criteria for age-appropriate development. Children are different from one another and will vary in the extent to which their behaviors match those given in the examples. The third assumption was that these foundations, especially the behavioral examples for each foundation, are not meant to be assessment items; rather, they are meant to be guidelines and teaching tools. Educators, early childhood special\u00ad ists, and others involved in any effort to describe the behaviors typical of children at around 48 months of age compared with children at around 60 months of age will find themselves humbled by the realization that the developmental changes apparent over the course of a single year (albeit a duration that is one-quarter of the child's lifetime to date) can be subtle. In other words, one should not expect extensive changes in the behavior of preschool children during a 12-month period. Indeed, individual differences in the characteristics and behavior of children of any age can be greater than the average behavioral changes they will experience over the course of a year of development. The purpose of these foundations, however, is to highlight the developmental differ\u00adences that are most common between typical children at around 48 and 60 months of age. Although the differ\u00adences between children of each age can be subtle, there are some consis\u00adtent themes that run throughout the social-emotional domain. Compared with younger children, for example, children at around 60 months of age are more behaviorally competent and take greater active initiative in social interactions and learning; they have an enhanced psychological awareness of themselves and others; they have a greater capacity for self-control; and their social relationships are more reciprocal in quality. In general, these differences should be apparent in vari\u00adous ways across different social and emotional areas. Children are a remarkably diverse population, even when children of comparable ages are considered. They vary in their temperamental qualities and personality, family background, cultural heritage and values, and other features that make the application of these foundations (and the behavioral examples included in each) a challeng- Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education ing task. This is another reason the examples should be used for illustra\u00adtive purposes only. Indeed, the varia\u00adbility in children's temperamental qualities, for instance, means that different children will display skills relevant to each social-emotional foundation in individual ways, thus requiring care and sensitivity in the application of these foundations. It is important that the individual charac\u00adteristics of a child, the child's family, and their background be considered seriously in determining how the foundations relate to the child. Indeed, the variability in children's temperamental qualities, for instance, means that different children will display skills relevant to each social-emotional foundation in individual ways, thus requiring care and sensitivity in the application of these foundations. Children in California are particu\u00ad larly diverse in their culture of origin. Culture is associated with family val\u00adues and practices, language, and other characteristics that are directly related to the meaning of these foundations and their application to individual chil\u00addren, especially children who are from underrepresented groups, English learners, or from special populations. Although the developmental research literature is rich in studies of Eng\u00adlish-speaking, middle-class European-American children, there is, unfortu\u00adnately, a dearth of studies focusing on children who speak other languages and have other backgrounds. The few studies that do exist are often so spe\u00adcific to children from particular back\u00adgrounds or circumstances as to be of limited generalizability. With culture \u0018 in mind, a number of important stud\u00adies were enlisted in the preparation of these foundations (e.g., Cabrera and Garcia-Coll 2004; Fitzgerald and oth\u00aders 2003; Hughes and Chen 1999; Hughes and others 2006; Johnson 2005; and Johnson and others 2003). But it is clear that much more study is needed. The lack of adequate research litera\u00ad ture on the social-emotional develop\u00adment of preschoolers who are English learners or from backgrounds other than European-American should be considered when using these founda\u00adtions because they may be of uncer\u00adtain applicability to such children. The use of language as an indicator of social or emotional competency, for example, may be very different as applied to English learners, especially when they are observed in play groups with predominantly English-speaking children or are being observed by an English-speaking teacher. The range of social relationships on which children can depend may be influenced by the cultural context of the child's develop\u00adment as well as the dominant language of the adults and children at home. For some children, language can be socially isolating. Certain social and emotional themes in this section, such as \"Initiative in Learning,\" may be limited in application to children from cultural backgrounds that discourage the kind of assertiveness typical of middle-class, English-speaking children in the same preschool pro\u00adgram or setting. It is important, then, to acknowledge that the research literature providing a basis for these foundations draws on populations of children that vary widely in their diversity and, thus, must be consid\u00adered carefully. SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT \u0018 Likewise, these foundations must be used carefully for children with special needs. Children who have physical or mental challenges, neuro\u00addevelopmental disorders, or other spe\u00adcial needs proceed developmentally in ways that are similar to, but also dif\u00adferent from, more typically developing children. Again, the research literature is limited regarding the documentation of age-related changes in social and emotional competencies. Furthermore, because the examples illustrating each of these competencies are written with typically developing children in mind, they may not be consistently relevant to children with special needs. Care\u00adgivers and teachers will be relied on for the insight needed to understand how these foundations can be applied to the children in their care. It is important, then, to acknowledge that the research literature providing a basis for these foundations draws on populations of children that vary widely in their diversity and, thus, must be considered carefully. Young children acquire social and emotional competencies in ways that are often different from how they acquire competence in the naming of letters or numbers. As illustrated in this section, social-emotional skills emerge through children's experience in close relationships and the var\u00adied activities that occur in relational experience, such as shared conversa\u00adtion, warm nurturance, and guided assistance in learning capacities for sociability, responsibility, and self-control. Social and emotional skills also develop through the shared activi\u00adties of a developmentally appropriate, well-designed preschool environment. In such settings (and at home) and under the guidance of sensitive teach\u00aders, young children develop an under\u00adstanding of other people's feelings and needs, are encouraged to feel empathy and caring, learn to manage their own behavior as responsible group mem\u00adbers, and acquire a variety of other capabilities that will be directly rel\u00adevant to their success in managing the classroom environment of kindergarten or the primary grades. Last, but perhaps most important, play is a central context for social and emotional development in early child\u00adhood. Although these foundations focus specifically on developmental changes in only one kind of play (spe\u00adcifically, pretend play), it is apparent that many kinds of play contribute to social-emotional competence in pre\u00adschoolers, including social play with caregivers and peers, play with toys and other objects, structured group activities, and even games with rules. One conclusion to be derived from this observation is that play is an essential cornerstone of healthy social and emo\u00adtional development in early childhood and contributes to the skills neces\u00adsary for adjustment to and success in school. This conclusion is reflected in the fact that one-third of the examples illustrating these competencies are based on children's experience in play. Play is a central context for social and emotional development in early childhood. The preparation of these foundations enlisted many sour ces, including documents fr om the CDE detailing developmental expectations in relevant domains for older and younger children. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education In addition, early childhood standards from a number of other states were consulted. 1 Moreover, general sources on early childhood development (e.g., Berk 2006; Hohmann and Weikart 1995; Shaffer 2004), culture and development (e.g., Rogoff 1990, 2003), and early learning (Committee on Early Childhood Pedagogy 2001; Committee on Developments in the Sci\u00adence of Learning 2000) were consulted. In addition, a number of well-validated assessment tools for preschoolers were relied on, including those developed by Bricker and others (1999); Dichtel\u00ad 1Early childhood standards from the following states were examined in the preparation of the foundations: Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachu\u00adsetts, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington. \u0018 miller and others (2001); High/Scope Educational Research Foundation and others (2003); and Squires, Brickner, and Twombly (2003). The most important source for preparing these foundations was the research literature in developmental and educational psychology concern\u00ading early social and emotional develop\u00adment. A reference list is included at the end of this section. Detailed biblio\u00adgraphic notes for reference materials consulted for this domain also appear later in this section. The bibliographic notes include useful background infor\u00admation for individuals who may wish to learn more about the research basis for these foundations. SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT \u0018 Self 1.0 Self-Awareness At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age 1.1 Describe their physical character\u00ad istics, behavior, and abilities positively. 1.1 Compare their characteristics with those of others and display a grow\u00ading awareness of their psychological characteristics, such as thoughts and feelings. Children view their characteristics and abilities positively, enjoy demonstrating them, and assert their own preferences and desires. Children also want to be viewed positively by adults who matter to them. Children are confident in their abilities and characteristics, sometimes (depending on cultural values) comparing them favorably with those of others. Children also regard themselves in terms of their past abilities and remain sensitive to how they are viewed by adults, peers, and other people whose opinions matter to them. Examples Seeks to do things by himself, sometimes refus\u00ad ing an adult's assistance, and communicates, \"Do it myself.\" \"I like rice!\" or \"See or don't like getting wet\" or \"Look what I did!\" Shows a painting or demonstrates an accom\u00ad plishment to elicit the acknowledgment of the teacher or parent and smiles when the adult responds. Communicates, \"My skin is brown,\" in a positive manner. Seems dismayed and withdraws after her behavior is disapproved of by an adult. Communicates, \"I did it!\" or \"Yea!\" after finishing a puzzle. Communicates, \"Mine!\" when claiming a preferred toy. Expects success in a game or task, even when he has just failed at the same task. Examples Communicates, \"I can ride a bike, but my baby sister doesn't.\" Smiles with delight at accomplishing something that was difficult to do and looks to the teacher for acknowledgment. Communicates, \"I couldn't do that when I was little.\" Communicates, \"Sometimes I just want to be by myself.\" Seems disappointed if a drawing or demonstra\u00ad tion of physical skill does not elicit the expected acknowledgement fr om an adult. Tries new things, even those that may be too difficult. While using her wheelchair, communicates, \"I can go faster than you!\" Asks for help after several attempts to solve a problem. Communicates, \"I can speak Spanish and English.\" Watches a peer demonstrate a skill, then tries to do the same thing. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 2.0 Self-Regulation At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age 2.1 Need adult guidance in managing their attention, feelings, and impulses and show some effort at self\u00adcontrol. 2.1 Regulate their attention, thought feelings, and impulses more contently, although adult guidance is sometimes necessary. s, sis\u00ad Children follow simple rules and routines, seek to cooperate, manage classroom transitions, and make efforts at self\u00adcontrol (such as self\u00adsoothing and waiting) with adult guidance. Children also easily lose control of their attention, feelings, and behavior. Children anticipate routines, cooperate with fewer reminders, can focus attention on the task at hand, and manage transitions. They are more capable of emotional and behavioral self\u00adregulation but sometimes require adult guidance. Examples Jumps up and down on the couch but stops when asked to do so by a parent or teacher. Manages transitions in the classroom routine (such as moving from play time to cleanup) when helped to anticipate them or provided some choice. When asked by a teacher to share with another child, may initially resist but eventually cooperates. Knows to put away his coat and boots after arriving at the classroom. Is distracted by other children when working at a table or easel. Accepts a teacher's comfort when distressed and calms r eadily. Reacts strongly when a peer takes away a valued toy. Has difficulty following instructions when too many directions are provided at once. Covers her eyes when seeing something that is upsetting. Turns away instead of hitting another child. Has difficulty waiting an extended period for a desir ed object. Is learning to act differently in different settings (e.g., speaking loudly outside rather than in the classroom), although often has to be reminded to do so. Examples May anticipate cleanup after play time and begin cleaning up without being prompted to do so. Puts away books where they belong without being prompted by an adult. Is more capable of focusing attention on a task in a busy classroom and is less distractible than a three\u00adyear old. Spontaneously tells the teacher she has broken something. Tells another child about how to treat the classr oom pet. Suggests that he can share the blocks with another child. With a teacher's prompt, remembers to use words to convey strong feelings (e.g., \"It makes me mad when you push!\"). Tries to control her distress after falling off a tricycle. Asks for a teacher's help when another child will not shar e. Can be overheard saying when scared by a story, \"It's just pretend\" or \"That's not real, right?\" Has strategies for waiting (such as distracting herself or not looking at the desired object). Deliberately slows down her movements in a game such as \"Red Light - Green Light.\" Explains the reasons for a behavioral rule (e.g., \"We walk inside so we don't bump into other people\"). Self | \u0018 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 \u0018 | Self 3.0 Social and Emotional Understanding At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 3.1 Seek to understand people's feelings and behavior, notice diversity in human characteristics, and are interested in how people are similar and different. 3.1 Begin to comprehend the mental and psychological reasons people act as they do and how they contribute to differences between people. Children are interested in people's feelings and the reasons they feel that way. They can describe familiar routines, inquire about the causes and consequences of behavior, and notice how people are similar and different, although their understanding is limited. Children have a better understanding of people's thoughts and feelings as well as their own. They comprehend that another's ideas can be mistaken. They are also beginning to understand differences in personality, temperament, and background (e.g., culture) and their importance. Examples Examples Communicates, \"Marco's crying. He fell down.\" Conveys a range of feelings, including happy, sad, and mad and describes simple situations that evoke them. Describes what happens at circle time. Shows interest in how another child's appearance or eating habits ar e dif ferent from his own. Enacts in pretend play everyday situations involving people' s emotions and needs (e.g., the baby doll is crying because she is hungry). Understands that another child might be mad because she couldn' t do what she desir ed (e.g., her block tower keeps falling down). Comments on differences in behavior or appearance between boys and girls. Wants to ride in Johnny's wheelchair or use Sara' s walker . Begins to understand how people's feelings can be alike and, on other occasions, be very differ ent. Tells a teacher, \"Jorge was sad because he thought his mommy wasn' t coming.\" Tries to hide how she is feeling or to \"mask\" her feelings with a dif fer ent emotional expression (e.g., appearing calm and unafraid when encoun\u00adtering a big dog). Communicates about a peer, \"Emma's really shy.\" Has a growing vocabulary for identifying emo\u00adtions and can describe mor e complex emotional situations that might evoke dif ferent feelings. Explores more complex feelings, desires, and concepts in pr etend play . Deliberately does not communicate truthfully about inappr opriate behavior . Describes which peers are friendly, aggressive, or have other qualities. Tends to play in same\u00adsex groups. Notices a child with a physical disability and responds with questions or curiosity . Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Self | \u0018 4.0 Empathy and Caring At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 4.1 Demonstrate concern for the needs of others and people in distress. 4.1 Respond to another's distress and needs with sympathetic caring and are more likely to assist. Children respond with concern when a child or adult is distressed, strive to understand why, and may display simple efforts to assist the other person. Children respond sympathetically to a dis\u00adtressed person and are more competent at responding helpfully. Examples Examples Asks a teacher, \"Why is Jessie crying?\" and/or asks the teacher to help. Watches another child crying loudly and makes a sad face. Communicates about an infant nearby, \"Jacob's scar ed of that loud noise.\" Gets a toy for a distressed peer and may communicate, \"Do you feel better?\" Brings a carrot to school for the class guinea pig. Asks a younger child, \"Why are you crying?\" and when told that she misses her mommy , commu\u00ad nicates, \"Don't worry\u2014your mommy will come back soon.\" May communicate, \"That's not fair!\" in response to another child being excluded fr om the group. Helps a friend rebuild a fallen block tower. Offers a friend her favorite book when she looks or acts sad. May come to the defense of a friend who is teased by a peer . Asks a teacher for bandages after a peer has fallen and scraped his knee. Asks, \"Want some water?\" of a friend who is coughing.

Examples Examples Children become engaged in learning opportunities, approach learning with enthusiasm, and have confidence in their capacities to learn more. But they may give up when facing difficult problem\u00adsolving challenges. Shows interest in many different activities in the classr oom. Responds positively to a teacher's invitation to try a new activity . Moves away after working on a puzzle that he has been unable to solve. Asks, \"Why?\" when faced with a perplexing discovery . Notices when a new science display has been pr epared by the teacher. Starts many challenging puzzles but may finish few . Children are self\u00adconfident learners who become actively involved in formal and informal learning opportunities by asking questions, proposing new ways of doing things, and offering their own ideas and theories. Communicates, \"Here's a different way!\" Asks \"why\" questions fairly often out of real curiosity (e.g., \"Why is the worm doing that?\"). Suggests another way of creating a castle at the sand table. Wants to try again when failing in his initial efforts to solve a pr oblem. Offers information about animals that she has lear ned at home. Initiates a conversation with an adult about a class activity . Works hard on a project that has captured her inter est. Communicates, \"I'm going to play with blocks and then go to the science table.\" Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education \u0018\u0018 Social Interaction 1.0 Interactions with Familiar Adults At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age 1.1 Interact with familiar adults comfort\u00ad ably and competently, especially in familiar settings. 1.1 Participate in longer and more reciprocal interactions with familiar adults and take greater initiative in social interaction. Examples Examples Children comfortably interact with familiar adults in play or problem solving, ask questions or communicate about their experiences, cooperate with instructions, or demonstrate skills to the familiar adult, especially in familiar settings. Participates in pretend play or storytelling with a familiar pr eschool teacher. Shares a brief conversation initiated by a familiar adult or initiates such a conversation. Shows a familiar adult a picture she has drawn. Responds appropriately to a request or question by a teacher , although perhaps with delay. Seeks assistance of a familiar adult, often with nonverbal cues. Stays close to a familiar adult when faced with adult strangers or in an unfamiliar setting. Children take increasing initiative in interacting with familiar adults through conversation, suggesting a shared activity or asking for the adult's assistance, and cooperate readily. Asks a specific teacher to help build a road in the sandbox and interacts cooperatively with the teacher for a sustained period. Communicates to a weekly volunteer, \"Guess what I did!\" and continues conversing with the visitor about it. Answers a teacher's question, then asks the teacher another question. Communicates, \"What?\" or \"Huh?\" when the teacher asks a question that the child does not understand. SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 \u0018\u0018 | Social Interaction 2.0 Interactions with Peers At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 2.1 Interact easily with peers in shared activities that occasionally become cooperative efforts. 2.1 More actively and intentionally cooperate with each other. Examples Examples 2.2 Participate in simple sequences of pretend play.* 2.2 Create more complex sequences of pretend play that involve planning, coordination of roles, and cooperation. Examples Examples * Children may \"play\" whether or not they are communicating orally, narrating the play, or motorically engaging in activities. For example, they may ask an adult or peer to assist in the motor aspects of play. Children interact comfortably with one or two playmates, although sociability is still basic. Children sometimes share materials and communicate together, occasionally working cooperatively on a mutual goal or project, especially with adult support. After watching another child dig in the sandbox, begins to dig alongside in a similar fashion; eventually the two childr en are digging together. Paints with other children on easels side by side, with the childr en looking at each other's pictures, occasionally conflicting over the sharing of paints, and commenting about their own painting. Uses rhythm instruments together with several other childr en. With adult prompting, shares the blocks she is using or participates in tur n\u00adtaking with another child. Children play imaginative, complementary roles (such as parent and child) in pretend play but without much planning or a well\u00addeveloped story line. Communicates to another child, \"I'll be the tiger!\" when they ar e playing outside. Leaps into the air in pretend \"flying,\" and other childr en join in and do the same. Children initiate and participate in more complex, cooperative activity with peers. This may involve working together in groups to achieve a shared goal or communicating about how to share materials so all can use them. Invites several children to help dig a hole in the sandbox. Suggests taking turns riding the tricycle. Responds appropriately to another child's ideas about how to build a better car track on the floor . Shares play dough so another child can make something. Talks for several minutes with another child about how they ar e dressing up in adult clothes for pre\u00ad tend play. Joins several other children to create a train track, using blocks on the floor . Holds the bubble wand for another child so she can blow bubbles. Sets the table with another child, communicating about what is needed next. Children develop longer, more complex pretend play narratives involving a shared script, coordination of child\u00adselected roles, and mutual correction within those roles as they play. Creates with a small group of children an extended imaginary story with a beginning, a middle, and an end (e.g., a story of sickness and healing that involves a doctor' s visit, a trip to the hospital, an operation, and the patient's recovery). Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Social Interaction | \u0018\u0018 2.0 Interactions with Peers (Continued) At around 48 months of age Examples (Continued) Begins roaring like a scary monster; as other childr en notice, they run away in mock terror or become monsters, too. Pretends with another child to make a birthday cake, then the two sing \"Happy Birthday .\" Acts out a story with peers as a teacher is r eading it to them. At around 60 months of age Examples (Continued) Communicates to another child, \"You can't say that! Y ou're the baby, remember?\" While playing with other children, communicates, \"I'm sick,\" to which another child r esponds, \"Really?\" and he responds, \"No, just pretend.\" Communicates to another child, \"Let's say this is a secr et cave, OK?\" and the other children in the group respond, \"OK!\" SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 2.3 Seek assistance in resolving peer conflict, especially when disagree\u00ad ments have escalated into physical aggression. 2.3 Negotiate with each other, seeking adult assistance when needed, and increasingly use words to respond to conflict. Disagreements may be expressed with verbal taunting in addition to physical aggression. Children seek adult help when experiencing conflict with another child. Peer disagreements (such as those regarding the sharing of toys) can escalate into physical aggression, although not as readily as happens with children of younger ages. Children can suggest simple conflict resolu\u00adtion strategies as well as respond to adult suggestions for resolving peer disputes. Children may taunt or tease another child rather than hitting and may also retaliate when provoked. Examples Examples Pulls another child off the tricycle he wants to ride, then the other child cries and runs to the teacher for help. At the block area, communicates to the teacher, \"She won' t share!\" when another child takes all the blocks. Immediately begins to cry when another child knocks down the block structur e he was building, then looks for adult assistance. Communicates at the water table where other childr en are playing, \"When can it be my turn?\" Excludes another child from the group, communi\u00adcating, \"Y ou can't play with us.\" Communicates to another child in the block area, \"I'm playing with these; you play with those,\" or suggests taking tur ns. Communicates, \"I don't like it when you push me!\" without a pr ompt from the teacher. Pushes another child who shoved her in line, to which other childr en respond, \"Stop that!\" California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 \u0018\u0018 | Social Interaction 3.0 Group Participation At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 3.1 Participate in group activities and are beginning to understand and cooperate with social expectations, group rules, and roles. 3.1 Participate positively and coopera\u00ad tively as group members. Examples Examples Children enjoy participating in group activities and are beginning to understand social expec\u00adtations and group rules and their application. Children may have difficulty, however, coordi\u00adnating their interests with those of the group. Enjoys playing simple games, such as \"Duck\u00adDuck\u00adGoose\" or \"Follow the Leader ,\" with adult help. Stays with the group for a nature walk. Notices when other children are missing from class. Responds appropriately when a teacher announces cir cle time or cleanup, although may need guidance in what to do. Is interested in playing games but often deviates fr om the rules. Attention often wanders after a brief period of gr oup activity, especially if it is not personally engaging, which may result in inappropriate behavior or nonparticipation. Begins to explore social roles (e.g., mother, teacher) in pr etend play. Responds appropriately to verbal prompts in songs or stories during cir cle time (e.g., \"Hokey Pokey,\" \"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes,\" \"Itsy Bitsy Spider\"). Needs help remembering how to prepare for an activity , such as getting ready to paint at an easel. With adult prompting, can share toys or wait for a tur n. Children participate in group activities with the ability to anticipate familiar routines and contribute to shared projects more competently as group members. Anticipates the predictable routines of the day, such as initiating hand washing without being pr ompted when snack time arrives. Actively explores social roles in imaginative play. Is more capable of sustained attention and r emaining engaged in group activities, such as putting a puzzle together cooperatively. Applies game rules more consistently for simple games. Knows the procedure for leaving the setting to go to the bathr oom or to another room and corrects children who do not follow the procedure. Anticipates and begins preparing for an activity, such as a painting pr oject. Sometimes shares spontaneously and thinks of tur n\u00adtaking without adult prompting. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Social Interaction | \u0018\u0018 4.0 Cooperation and Responsibility At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 4.1 Seek to cooperate with adult instructions but their capacities for self\u00adcontrol are limited, especially when they are frustrated or upset. 4.1 Have growing capacities for self\u00ad control and are motivated to cooperate in order to receive adult approval and think approvingly of themselves. Examples Examples Children strive to follow adult instructions to maintain a good relationship with the parent or teacher and because of incentives and rules. Children often become dismayed or distressed when corrected. Children have more difficulty complying with instructions when without adult support or when distressed or frustrated. Plays gently with the classroom rabbit when r eminded to do so by the teacher but may play more roughly on other occasions. Seems sad and hides after the teacher comments on inappr opriate behavior. Smiles when the teacher comments on the child's cooperative behavior while setting the table for lunch. Hits another child when frustrated, then looks at the teacher . Shouts angrily at another child, but looks confused or upset when the other child begins to cry . Participates in classroom routines, such as cleanup. Children's cooperation with adult instructions is more reliable because of better capacities for self\u00adcontrol. Children are motivated by adult approval and by a desire to view themselves approvingly for their good conduct, reflecting their acceptance of adult standards for themselves. Tells another child to be gentle with the classroom guinea pig. Suggests taking turns with another child who wants to ride the tricycle. Spontaneously communicates, \"I'm a good helper!\" Accidentally spills paint on another child's art\u00adwork, then communicates, \"I'm sorry ,\" or gets another piece of paper for the other child. Communicates, \"uh\u00adoh,\" and begins to pick up the pieces of a puzzle she has knocked of f a shelf. Works cooperatively with a friend to wipe off the table with sponges after lunch. Responds cooperatively when his behavior is corr ected by a teacher. California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT \u0018\u0018 Relationships 1.0 Attachments to Parents At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age 1.1 Seek security and support from their primary family attachment figures. 1.1 Take greater initiative in seeking support from their primary family attachment figures. Examples Examples 1.2 Contribute to maintaining positive relationships with their primary family attachment figures. 1.2 Contribute to positive mutual cooperation with their primary family attachment figures. Examples Examples Children use their family caregivers (e.g., mother, father, grandparent, other adult raising the child) as sources of security and support, especially in challenging circumstances, by obtaining comfort, requesting help, and communicating about feelings. Plays comfortably on the other side of the room or the yar d while the parent talks to the teacher, but cries to the parent to be consoled if hurt or frustrated and readily calms when comforted. Asks for the parent's help with a task (e.g., putting on shoes) and may cooperate with the par ent's assistance. Responds positively to the parent's arrival after an absence. Runs over to his parent to tell about having bumped his head and asks for a hug. Children prefer interacting with their family caregivers, choosing them for sharing activities, providing assistance, and displaying discoveries or achievements. Asks the parent to watch something the child has lear ned to do. Prefers the parent's company or assistance to that of other adults who may be equally available. Responds positively when the mother initiates a conversation about a shared experience, although will not contribute much to the conversation at this age. Children seek the support of their family caregivers, especially in difficult situations, by requesting help in resolving conflicts with others, initiating cooperative problem solving, or seeking comfort when distressed. Seeks the parent's help in a conflict with a sibling. With assistance from the parent, describes her feelings about a r ecent upsetting experience. Seeks the parent's help with a difficult task (e.g., zipping a coat, folding a note) and cooperates r eadily. Children demonstrate an awareness of the mutuality of close relationships in their efforts to be helpful, showing interest in the family caregiver's feelings, preferences, or well\u00adbeing and sharing activities. Wants to make a birthday card for the parent while at school. Wants to help the parent care for a baby sibling or a pet or work together with the par ent on a task at home (as reported by the parent). Communicates feelings to the mother, sometimes taking the initiative in doing so. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Relationships | \u0018\u0018 1.0 Attachments to Parents (Continued) At around 48 months of age Examples (Continued) Shows the parent a drawing she has made at school that day . Shares information about parents with a teacher (e.g., \"My dad caught a fish!\"). At around 60 months of age Examples (Continued) Reports to the teacher about helping with a chore at home. Shows the attachment figure what she has been working on at school. 1.3 After experience with out\u00adof\u00adhome care, manage departures and separations from primary family attachment figures with the teacher's assistance. 1.3 After experience with out\u00adof\u00adhome care, comfortably depart from primary family attachment figures. Also maintain well\u00adbeing while apart from primary family attachment figures during the day. Children show affection to the family caregiver when the adult departs at the beginning of the day but may need the assistance of a teacher in coping with separation. Children are eager to begin the day in preschool. They respond affectionately to the family caregiver as the adult departs and have little difficulty being separated. Examples Examples SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT Gives the father a hug and kiss and lingers near him as he prepares to leave the child at preschool in the morning. Begins to fuss as the mother departs but soothes easily with the primary car egiver at school. After a distressing fall, cries for the mother but is r eassured when reminded that the mother will return at the end of the day. Manages his feelings after the parent leaves by playing with favorite objects, carrying personal objects ar ound the room, and so forth.

Children use their primary teachers and caregivers as sources of security and support, especially in challenging circumstances, by obtaining comfort, requesting help, and communicating about feelings. Children seek the support of their primary teachers and caregivers, especially when they are in difficult situations, by requesting the adult's help in resolving conflicts with others, initiating cooperative problem solving, or seeking comfort when distressed. Examples Examples Plays comfortably at a distance from the teacher, but cries to the teacher for help if hurt or frus\u00adtrated and readily calms when comforted. Prefers a particular teacher's company or assis\u00ad tance to that of other teachers who may be equally available. Seeks to be near the primary teacher if distressed by peer conflict or frightened by an unfamiliar adult. Talks about the primary teacher at home (as reported by the parent). Seeks the teacher's help in a conflict with another child. Seeks the teacher's assistance when confronted with a difficult task (e.g., challenging puzzle, new skill to master). Upon returning from outdoors, looks for the pri\u00ad mary teacher and asks to play a game together. With assistance from the primary caregiver, can describe his own feelings about a recent upsetting experience. 2.2 Contribute to maintaining positive relationships with primary teachers and caregivers. 2.2 Contribute to positive mutual cooperation with primary teachers and caregivers. Children prefer interacting with their primary teachers and caregivers, choosing them for sharing activities, seeking comfort and assistance, and displaying discoveries or achievements. Children demonstrate an awareness of the mutuality of close relationships in their efforts to be helpful, showing interest in the teacher's feelings, preferences, or well\u00adbeing and sharing personal experiences with the teacher. Examples Examples Completes a puzzle and proudly shows it to the primary teacher. Rebuffs another adult's attempts to help when the child is hurt and looks ar ound to locate the primary teacher or caregiver. Responds with pleasure when the primary teacher talks about a pr oject done together with the child; may not, however, contribute much to the conversation at this age. Responds with interest when the primary teacher communicates, \"Y esterday I got a new dog!\" and continues the conversation about dogs. Proudly displays a drawing or discovery to the primary teacher for a positive r esponse. Contributes to classroom cleanup at the pri\u00admary teacher' s request and, sometimes, initiates the cleanup of her own project, then shows the teacher what she has done.

Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education \u0018\u0018 Bibliographic Notes Self Self-Awareness There has been recent, considerable research interest in the development of self-awareness in young children, particularly because of the realization that older preschoolers are capable of significantly greater depth and psy\u00adchological insight into their concep\u00adtions of themselves. The period of time addressed by these foundations is, therefore, an important transitional period. This period starts with the very simple, rudimentary self-awareness of the younger child, focusing on physical self-recognition (such as in a mirror image) and dispositional self-attribu\u00adtions (e.g., \"Me big!\") and progressing to a more fully realized form of the psychological self-awareness of the early-grade-schooler. For general reviews of this research literature, consult Harter (1999, 2006) and Thompson (2006), who offer some\u00adwhat different portrayals of the emer\u00adgence of self-awareness during the preschool period. Self-awareness is an important component of early school success because young children's self-confidence shapes their interest, motivation, and persistence in aca\u00addemic work, and their success in the classroom reciprocally influences their sense of pride and accomplishment. Research revealing young children's (unr ealistically) optimistic self-regard has often used Harter's Self-Percep\u00adtion Scale for Children (Harter and Pike 1984); see studies by Stipek Stipek, Roberts, and Sanborn 1984). The sensitivity of preschool children to adults' evaluative judgments of their performance is also well documented by Stipek's research (1995; Stipek, Recchia, and McClintic 1992). A number of studies have revealed the emerging awareness of internal, psy\u00adchological characteristics in the self-awareness of older four-year-olds; see Eder (1989, 1990), Measelle and oth\u00aders (1998), and the work of Marsh and his colleagues (Marsh, Craven, and Debus 1998; Marsh, Ellis, and Craven 2002). This work challenges earlier, traditional views that preschoolers are focused exclusively on observ\u00adable appearance and behavior in their self-perceptions and shows that when developmentally appropriate research methods are used, even four-year-olds reveal a dawning understanding of their psychological selves. Self-awareness is an important component of early school success because young children's self-confidence shapes their interest, motivation, and persistence in academic work . . . Povinelli's creative research studies have shown that older preschoolers are also capable of perceiving themselves in a more extended temporal context, including the past and future (Povinelli 2001; Povinelli, Landau, and Perilloux 1996; Povinelli and others 1999; Povi\u00adnelli and Simon 1998). That capability is relevant to both autobiographical SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 \u0018\u0018 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT memory development and self-aware\u00ad ness. Finally, by the time they reach kindergarten, young children are already becoming experts in the use and interpretation of social comparison information, a skill that will continue to develop throughout the primary school years (Pomerantz and others 1995). Older preschoolers are just beginning to incorporate social comparison infor\u00admation into their self-perceptions. Self-Regulation The development of self-regula\u00ad tion involves emerging capacities to suppress a dominant response and to perform, instead, a subdominant response. It is also associated with the self-control of impulsivity and the development of more deliberate, intentional activity throughout early and middle childhood. Self-regula\u00adtion is relevant to the management of emotions and emotion-related behav\u00adior, attention, cognitive activity, and social behavior (such as impulses to act aggressively when provoked). The significant growth in self-regulation in early childhood is revealed through the contrast between the impulsiv\u00adity of a toddler and the capacities for more careful, deliberate behavior of a child preparing to enter kindergarten (although these capacities are not, of course, consistently exercised). Bron\u00adson (2000) has written a valuable over\u00adview of research and practical knowl\u00adedge on this topic (see also Brazelton and Sparrow 2001; Knitzer 2000; Committee on Integrating the Sci\u00adence of Early Childhood Development 2000). The relevance of self-regulation to young children's school readiness is widely acknowledged because of the importance of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional self-control to learn\u00ading and classroom conduct (see Kopp 2002; Thompson 2002; Thompson [in press]). Several research teams have found that differences in aspects of self-regulation predict children's read\u00ading and mathematics achievement in the early primary grades (Alexander, Entwisle, and Dauber 1993; Howse and others 2003; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network 2003a). Self-regulation is relevant to the management of emotions and emotion-related behavior, attention, cognitive activity, and social behavior (such as impulses to act aggressively when provoked). The development of self-regula\u00ad tion has been a topic of long-stand\u00ading inter est to developmental scholars (see reviews of this research: Kopp 1982; Kopp and Wyer 1994). This topic has recently gained renewed atten\u00adtion under the concepts of \"effort\u00adful control\" and \"executive function.\" Although effortful control is often studied as a component of emergent personality, developmental research\u00aders, including Eisenberg (Eisenberg and others 2004; Liew, Eisenberg, 2004) and Kochanska (Kochan\u00adska and Knaack 2003; Kochanska, Murray, and Harlan 2000), have documented important developmental changes in young children's capacities for effortful control. Their research has revealed not only significant increases in children's capacities for self-regulated conduct throughout early and middle childhood, but also a consistent association between indi\u00advidual differences in effortful control and independent measures of social Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education \u0018\u0018 competence, emotion regulation, conscience development, and psycho\u00adlogical adjustment. Higher effortful control is, in short, a benefit for young children's deliberate and socialized conduct. The research on executive function seeks to explain young children's prob\u00adlem-solving behavior in regard to their ability to regulate their attentional and cognitive processes, another aspect of self-regulation (see Zelazo and oth\u00aders 2003). This research identifies the period of three to five years of age as an especially important developmental period for executive function, which may be associated with concurrent changes in brain functioning (Bunge and Zelazo 2006; Diamond and Taylor 1996; Gerstadt, Hong, and Diamond 1994). Among the various capacities young childr en gradually acquire for self- control, emotion regulation has been of particular interest to developmental scientists because of its relevance to social competence and psychological adjustment. Thompson, Meyer, and Jochem (in press) have written several reviews of theory and research on this topic, summarizing an expanding body of research literature. Social and Emotional Understanding Over the past several decades, there has been an enormous amount of research interest in the early develop\u00adment of social and emotional under\u00adstanding. This interest has arisen from the realization that, contrary to tradi\u00adtional ideas, toddlers and preschoolers are not egocentric but are, instead, very interested in others' beliefs and how those beliefs compare with their own (see Dunn 1988; Saarni 1999). Further exploration of this topic has also been motivated by the r ealization that early differences in social and emotional understanding are associ\u00adated with individual differences in social competence. Preschoolers who are more socially and emotionally per\u00adceptive are capable of greater success in their relationships with peers and adults (see Denham and others 2003; Denham and 2004; Halberstadt, Denham, and Dunsmore 2001), which is relevant to school readiness. Young children who are more competent in understanding others' feelings have been found, for example, to become more academi\u00adcally competent in the primary grades, which may arise from the more suc\u00adcessful peer relationships to which they contribute (Izard 2002; Izard Knitzer who are more socially and emotionally per ceptive are capable of greater success in their relationships with peers and adults . . . In recent years, research in this area has gr own under the idea that young children develop a progressively more complex \"theory of mind,\" by which they explain people's behavior with respect to internal mental states. They gradually come to understand internal mental states more and more fully. Research on developing theory of mind has focused on the ages of three to five years, the period during which young SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT \u0018\u0018 children advance from a theory of mind that is focused primarily on compre\u00adhending others' intentions, desires, and feelings as motivators of behavior, to a more advanced theory of mind in which they also understand the nature of people's thoughts and beliefs as motivators of behavior. One of the cen\u00adtral features of this conceptual advance is the four-year-old's emerging under\u00adstanding that people's beliefs can be mistaken; thus, others can be misled or fooled, and the child's own feelings can be hidden or masked. The research literature on developing theory of mind is vast; recent summaries can be found in Wellman (2002) and Harris (2006). Although young children's under\u00ad standing of the internal determinants of behavior remains rudimentary, there is evidence that they are already begin\u00adning to comprehend the concept of personality characteristics and their association with enduring behavioral characteristics in others. This emerg\u00ading understanding parallels similar advances in their ability to perceive themselves in terms of psychological characteristics as well, as is discussed in the bibliographic note on self-aware\u00adness. Research by Heyman and her colleagues shows that by the later pre\u00adschool years, children are beginning to derive personality-like generalizations about the behavior of others (see Giles and Heyman 2005a, 2005b; Heyman, Gee, and Giles 2003; Heyman and Gelman 2000). One of the central features of this conceptual advance is the four-year-old's emerging understanding that people's beliefs can be mistaken . . . There is also vigorous research literature on young children's developing emotion understanding, an aspect of theory of mind that is especially important to social competence. This research shows that from three to five years of age, young children become increasingly capable of identifying a broader range of emotions and describing prototypical situations in which these emotions might be elicited. They also become capable of explaining the causes of these emotions and their consequences in ways that reveal a greater understanding of the psychological bases of emotional experience (e.g., frustrated goals with respect to anger). This is consistent, of course, with broader characteristics of their developing theory of mind. The research on developing emotion understanding is reviewed by Denham (1998, 2006), Harris (1989), Lagattuta and Thompson (2007), Saarni and others (2006), and Thompson (in press; Thompson 2006; Thompson, Goodvin, and Meyer 2006; Thompson and Lagattuta 2006). The later preschool years also wit\u00ad ness growth in event knowledge\u2014that is, the capacity to comprehend and predict everyday routines\u2014which is an important component of social under\u00adstanding. Young preschool children can describe the sequence of events that characterize everyday routines and experiences in their lives (e.g., a trip to the grocery store), and older preschool children have more compre\u00adhensive knowledge of these events (see Hudson 1993; Narratives from the Crib 1989; Nelson 1993). Finally, the preschool years also witness young children's growing Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education \u0018\u0018 awareness of and response to diver\u00ad sity in gender, culture, and ethnicity, particularly as these are apparent in differences in people's appearance and behavior. This is complex research literature, particularly because of the multiple origins (e.g., social learning, conceptual development, direct expo\u00adsure to diversity) of young children's responses to human diversity in their experience; see Aboud (2005, 2003). Empathy and Caring Young children's capacities to respond sympathetically and help\u00adfully to others in distress have been of long-standing interest to parents, professionals, and researchers. These capacities build on children's develop\u00ading social and emotional understand\u00ading and contribute to their ability to cooperate successfully with others in group learning environments. In understanding the development of caring, it is important to distinguish a young child's emotional r esponse to another's distress, which emerges very early, from the behavioral capacity to help the distressed person. Know\u00ading how to aid a peer in distress is a complex challenge to a young child (it is an even greater conceptual chal\u00adlenge to figure out how to assist a distressed adult); therefore, genuine helping behavior emerges later in the preschool years than does a child's emotional response to another's upset. The period of three to four years of age is a crucial one. From before the age of three, young children respond with concerned attention to the distress of another and are interested in finding out why the person is upset. But it is not until later in the preschool years that children can accompany their empathic response with assistance (although this does not necessarily occur r eliably). For recent reviews of this research, consult Eisenberg, Spin-rad, and Sadovsky (2006), Thompson (1998), and Zahn-Waxler and Robinson (1995). Initiative in Learning How children approach new learn\u00ad ing and problem-solving challenges is a critical feature of their academic success. \"Approaches to learning\" is an important predictor of classroom achievement in kindergarten and the primary grades, with the term \"approaches to learning\" defined as teacher ratings of children's classroom engagement, motivation, and participa\u00adtion (Alexander, Entwisle, and Dauber 1993; Duncan, Claessens, and Engel 2005). Young children's natural curios\u00adity, interest, and self-confidence that they can discover the answers to their questions are a central component of their capacities to benefit from learn\u00ading opportunities (Thompson 2002). Beginning in early childhood, there ar e significant differences in the enthusiasm, motivation, and self-confidence that children bring to new learning situations. The work of Dweck and her colleagues has demonstrated that from relatively early in childhood, children develop distinctly different learning styles that influence their ini\u00adtiative in learning and their persistence when faced with difficult challenges (see Burhans and Dweck 1995; \"performance orientation\" focus on efforts in learning situations that elicit positive evaluations from others and avoid negative judgments. As a consequence, these children may avoid situations that are likely to result in failure and they may not per- SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 \u0018\u0018 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT sist in circumstances in which they are unlikely to succeed. This orientation can, under some circumstances, result in a learned helplessness orientation in which children tend to give up after failing because they do not have con\u00adfidence in their ability to succeed. In contrast, children with a \"learning (or mastery) orientation\" focus on efforts that increase their ability. These chil\u00addren will be more likely to tackle dif\u00adficult challenges if they can foster new learning (even if their initial efforts result in failure) and are more likely to persist until they are successful. This is the kind of learning orientation that best predicts classroom achieve\u00adment. These differences in learn\u00ading orientation are readily observed among primary grade students, but there is evidence that they are pres\u00adent among older preschoolers as well (see Burhans and Dweck 1995; Smiley and Dweck 1994). Research by Dweck and her colleagues indicates that these differences arise from many influ\u00adences, including the kinds of reactions by parents and teachers to children's achievement successes and failures that emphasize the child's intrinsic ability and strong effort. The research on learning orienta\u00ad tions focuses on individual differences among children of a given age. But there are also developmental differ\u00adences in preschool children's initia\u00adtive in learning, with younger children being more likely to approach new Young children's natural curiosity, interest, and self-confidence that they can discover the answers to their questions are a central component of their capacities to benefit from learning opportunities. learning situations with enthusiasm and self-confidence but not necessarily with persistence in confronting difficult problem-solving situations. In con\u00adtrast, older children are more active learners who are more persistent but who are also more likely to be creative problem solvers, proposing their own ideas and approaching new learn\u00ading opportunities with initiative and involvement (see Committee on Early Childhood Pedagogy 2001; The Role of Interest in Learning and Development 1992; Renninger and Wozniak 1985; Flavell, Miller, and Miller 2001). Social Interaction Interactions with Familiar Adults Young children regularly inter\u00ad act with familiar adults in preschool and other early childhood settings. Although these adults are not attach\u00adment figures, and children's relation\u00adships with them are not necessarily sources of security and support, a child's ability to interact competently with familiar adults is important to social competence and the ability to obtain the assistance the child needs. The ability to interact with other adults is important also to school success because children in kindergarten and the primary grades must interact with many adults other than their teachers. With the primary focus of develop\u00ad mental r esearch on young children's establishment and maintenance of close relationships, scientists have devoted considerably less attention to the growth of social skills relevant to interacting with familiar adults (see Durkin 1995 for a general source). The relevant research offers a por- Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education trayal that is consistent with conclu\u00ad sions from other foundations. Older three-year-olds have developed a num\u00adber of social skills for interacting com\u00adpetently with familiar adults\u2014includ\u00ading developing abilities to engage in simple conversations, enjoy other shared activities, and cooperate with requests or instructions\u2014and they can exercise these skills particularly in familiar and comfortable settings. Older four-year-olds are not only more advanced in most of these social skills but also take greater active initiative in interacting with familiar adults. Based on these conclusions, most children are becoming prepared for the variety of social encounters that will charac\u00adterize their experience in kindergarten and the primary grades. Interactions with Peers It was not so long ago that develop\u00ad mental researchers and practitioners underestimated the peer social skills of young children, interpreting epi\u00adsodes of conflict to reflect preschoolers' egocentrism and limited social inter\u00adest. With the growing experience of young children in preschool and early childhood settings, researchers have rethought peer interactions and have discovered that they are far more complex, sophisticated, and multi\u00adfaceted than earlier believed. This discovery is consistent with the devel\u00adopmental accomplishments described in the other foundations. As preschool\u00aders achieve considerable insights into others' thoughts and feelings through their growth in \"theory of mind,\" for example, they are capable of greater cooperation with other children and more adept at using conflict resolution strategies. \u0018\u0018 The development of social skills with peers is also important to the growth of school readiness. A number of studies have shown that the peer experiences of children in kindergarten and the primary grades are an important pre\u00addictor of children's academic success and school adjustment. Children who experience greater peer acceptance and positive peer relationships tend to feel more positively about coming to school, participate more in class\u00adroom activities, and achieve more in the classroom 1996, 1997; O'Neil and others 1997). The period of ages three to five years is a particularly significant one for the growth of social skills with peers, and these foundations illus\u00adtrate the multifaceted ways in which peer relationships evolve during this time (see reviews of this research by Rubin, Bukowski, and Parker [2006] and Rubin and others [2005]). Young children initially acquire greater skill and confidence in interacting with other children in playgroups of two or three; later, they do so in larger, well-coordinated peer groups. Among the important achievements of the later preschool period is the ability to initi\u00adate peer sociability and smoothly join others in play; to cooperatively and spontaneously share with others; to coordinate one's behavior with that of one or more other children; to com\u00admunicate in ways that other children can understand; and to spontaneously enlist procedures (such as turn-taking) that reduce the chance of peer conflict (Howes 1987, 1988; Vandell, Nenide, and Van Winkle 2006). SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT \u0018\u0018 Children's play with peers changes significantly during the later preschool period. Preschoolers become capable of greater cooperation and coordina\u00adtion in their shared activity, playing interactively rather than just side by side. In addition, imaginative or pre\u00adtend play\u2014one of the hallmarks of preschool play activity\u2014develops sig\u00adnificantly in complexity and sophisti\u00adcation. Young children proceed from simple sequences of pretend activity to well-coordinated, complex episodes of imaginative play that involve plan\u00adning, coordination of roles, and mutual correction as the story line is enacted (Goncu 1993; Howes 1987, 1988, 1992; Howes and Matheson 1992). The remarkable ability of older pre\u00adschool children to competently enact pretend roles, coordinate their activity with that of other children in pretend roles, and monitor the unfolding of the sociodramatic play script is consistent with\u2014and helps to confirm\u2014much of what we know about their social understanding and capacities for cooperation, self-awareness, and self-regulation during this period. Peer interactions do not always proceed happily, of course. There are significant developmental changes during this period in how young children express their hostility when disagreements arise. Younger pre\u00adschool children are more likely to respond with physical aggression, while older preschool children are more capable of expressing their hostility in more socially acceptable Imaginative or pretend play\u2014one of the hallmarks of preschool play activity\u2014develops significantly in complexity and sophistication. ways and are more likely to use verbal taunts and teasing rather than hitting (Tremblay 2000). Fortunately, there are also developmental changes in children's capacities for conflict negoti\u00adation, such that by the later preschool years, children are capable of spon\u00adtaneously suggesting simple conflict resolution strategies (such as propos\u00ading alternative play materials or taking turns) and enlisting negotiation over aggression (Howes 1987, 1988; Rubin and others 2005; Rubin, Bukowski, and Parker 2006; Vandell, Nenide, and Van Winkle 2006). These conflict reso\u00adlution strategies will develop further in the elementary grades, of course, but differences in the capacities of preschoolers to spontaneously enlist conflict resolution strategies are an important basis for their social compe\u00adtence with peers at this age. Group Participation The ability to participate coop\u00ad eratively and constructively in group activity is an essential skill in any group learning activity; thus, it is a critical component of school readi\u00adness. This substrand integrates the developmental achievements described in other social-emotional foundations and applies them to the young child's competency as a group member (see Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Early Childhood Programs 1997; Landy 2002). These developmental achieve\u00adments (described in detail in other foundations) include: Developing capacities for self-regula\u00adtion and self-contr ol, which enable the older preschool child to remem\u00adber the rules for classroom behavior, games, and other activities; apply the rules to his or her own behav- Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education ior; and spontaneously self-correct to better maintain compliance with those rules (Bronson 2000; Kopp 1982; Kopp and Wyer 1994) Developing skills for behavioral and attentional self-contr ol, which enable preschool children to gradu\u00adally attain a greater ability to delib\u00aderately focus attention; sit still for longer periods; manage transitions in the daily routine more easily; cooperate in games that require specific responses at particular times (e.g., \"Hokey Pokey\"); and be less fidgety and distractible (Zelazo and others 2003) Developing capacities for coopera\u00adtion and a sense of r esponsibility in relation to others, which cause older preschoolers to have a more consci\u00adentious commitment to complying with group procedures (sometimes, spontaneously correcting other children who fail to comply), often anticipating the procedures before being reminded by the teacher, and acting in a manner that helps the group to function better (Kochanska and Thompson 1997; Thompson and others 2006) Developing event knowledge, which enables the older child to under \u00ad stand and predict the ordinary rou\u00adtines of the classroom schedule; manage transitions in the routine well; and cooperate with new activi\u00adties when they are initiated by the teacher, especially when preparatory tasks for the activity are required (e.g., getting ready to paint at an easel) (Hudson 1993; Narratives from the Crib 1989; Nelson 1993). Developing social and emotional understanding, which enables older childr en (with a more advanced \"theory of mind\") to better coordi\u00ad\u0018\u0018 nate their own desires, needs, and interests with those of others, which, in turn, facilitates older children's capacities to collaborate on group activities as well as to play harmo\u00adniously with peers (Harris 2006; Thompson 2006) Developing self-awareness, which enables pr eschool children to identify themselves not just as indi\u00adviduals in a classroom but also as members of a group, and prompts older preschoolers to strive to make the group work better in shared activities (Harter 1999, 2006; Thompson 2006) The purpose of delineating a new substrand for gr oup participation, therefore, is to indicate how these different developmental achievements assemble in a manner that enables older preschool children, because of this developing constellation of skills, to be more constructive group partici\u00adpants than are younger children. In this respect, therefore, the whole (of these advances for classroom conduct) is truly greater than the sum of the developmental parts. Cooperation and Responsibility Because of the moral development theories of Piaget (1965) and Kohlberg (1969), young children were, for many years, believed to be motivated primar\u00adily by rewards and punishments in their cooperation with adult standards. This belief was consistent with the traditional view that young children are egocentric in considering the needs of others in relation to their own. Dur\u00ading the past several decades, however, a new view of the early growth of coop\u00aderation and responsibility\u2014studied under the term \"conscience develop- SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 \u00180 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ment\"\u2014has emerged. It emphasizes that in addition to responding to the incentives and punishments of adults, young children are motivated to coop\u00aderate by their emotional attachments to those adults and their desire to maintain positive relationships with them. Children cooperate in order to maintain relationships of mutual coop\u00aderation with the adults who care for them. Furthermore, young children are also motivated by the feelings of others to act in ways that do not cause others distress. Moreover, as they reach the end of the preschool years, children are also motivated to cooperate and act responsibly because in doing so, they think more approvingly of themselves. This reflects that young children have proceeded from a primarily \"external\" view of adults' expectations and stan\u00addards\u2014in other words, cooperating because this is what adults expect\u2014to an \"internalized\" acceptance of adult standards as their goal. The desire to perceive themselves as cooperative, helpful, and \"good\" emerges at this time and will remain an important, lifelong motivator of moral conduct. These conclusions about the devel\u00ad opment of cooperation and respon\u00adsibility emerge from a large body of research literature, to which Kochan\u00adska has made major contributions (e.g., see Kochanska 1997, 2002; Kochanska and Thompson 1997). A review of this research literature can be found in Thompson, Meyer, and McGinley (2006). The development of capacities for cooperation and respon\u00adsibility is important to early school success. A number of research teams have found that individual differences in children's cooperation capacities are directly associated with children's academic achievement in the early primary grades (Alexander, Entwisle, and Dauber 1993; McClelland, Mor\u00adrison, and Holmes 2000; Yen, Konold, and McDermott 2004). Children who show greater cooperative compliance with their teachers are capable of get\u00adting along better in the classroom and achieve more than do children who are less cooperative. During the past several decades, however, a new view of the early growth of cooperation and responsibility\u2014studied under the term \"conscience development\"\u2014 has emerged. Developmental changes in children's motivated cooperation and their grow\u00ading sense of responsibility build on developmental accomplishments in other social and emotional areas. In particular, these changes build on children's developing capacities for self-regulation and changes in self-awareness that enable older preschool\u00aders to perceive themselves as positive and approvable. In this respect, as in others, growth in the later preschool period is integrated and consistent across different areas of development. Relationships Attachments to Parents One of the central conclusions of developmental research is the extent to which young children rely on their close relationships with caregivers for emotional security and well-being. Decades of research on parent-child attachment relationships in infancy and early childhood have established the importance of the security of these relationships and their long-term Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education importance for a child's self-concept, relationships with others, and under\u00adstanding of what people are like (see reviews by Thompson 2006; Thomp\u00adson and others 2005; and Waters and others 1991). At the same time, developmental researchers realized that the caregivers on whom children are emotionally reliant are not always biological parents. Sometimes they are grandparents or other adults who assume a regular caregiving role in the child's life\u2014they are, in a sense, \"psy\u00adchological parents\" to the child. This is true when nonparents are substitute parents (such as when grandparents are providing full-time care instead of a parent who is incapacitated or absent) and when nonparents are co\u00adparents along with the child's biologi\u00adcal parents. In each case, these adult caregivers assume a parenting func\u00adtion in the child's life and are usually attachment figures. This substrand is labeled \"Attachments to Parents,\" although the foundations refer to \"primary family attachment figures\" to acknowledge the diversity of adults who are attachment figures to young children. Consistent with their psychological importance to young children, par\u00adent-child attachments have also been found to be important to the develop\u00adment of school readiness. Many stud\u00adies have found that the quality of the parent-child relationship in the pre\u00adschool years, especially its quality in terms of warmth and support to the child, predicts children's subsequent Children with more secure, supportive family relationships also show fewer conduct problems and have better work habits. \u0018\u0018 academic success in kindergarten and the early primary grades as well as their social competence in the class\u00adroom. Children with more secure, sup\u00adportive family relationships also show fewer conduct problems and have bet\u00adter work habits (Burchinal and others 2003c, 2005; Pianta, Nimetz, and Bennett 1997). The behavioral indications of parent- child attachment in preschoolers are well established (Marvin and Britner 1999), and the indicators of attach\u00adment relationships incorporated into this foundation are drawn from the extensive research literature as well as validated assessment instruments for assessing parent-child attachment quality (see Solomon and George 1999; Waters 2006). In contrast to the dependence of infants and toddlers on physical proximity to their caregivers, preschool children are more indepen\u00addent socially yet are still very emotion\u00adally reliant on their attachment figures. The indicators included here focus on how preschoolers seek security and support from their attachment figures in age-appropriate ways as well as their capacities to maintain positive relationships with their attachment figures through their own initiative (Maccoby 1984). An important develop\u00admental change in attachment relation\u00adships during this period is the greater initiative of older preschoolers in both seeking support and maintaining a relationship of positive mutual cooperation with their attachment figures, which is an outgrowth of their greater psychological understanding of the adult and of the relationship they SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 \u0018\u0018 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT share. As with younger children, pre\u00ad schoolers exhibit their trust in attach\u00adment figures through their preference to be with the adult; the adult's capac\u00adity to assist and comfort them when others cannot; their efforts to attract the attachment figure's positive regard (and avoid criticism by this person); their pleasure in shared activity with the adult; and the greater ease with which they can disclose and discuss troubling topics (such as distressing experiences) with the attachment figure. All of the behavioral indicators included in this foundation should be readily observed of children interacting with their family attachment figures while in a preschool or early childhood setting. An additional indicator con\u00adcerns preschoolers' success in coping with departing from the attachment figure at the beginning of the day and with separation throughout the day, for which younger preschool children require greater assistance than do older preschool children. This differ\u00adence arises from the greater ability of older preschoolers to maintain a satisfying mental representation of the attachment figure and their relation\u00adship with that person to sustain them; their greater self-regulatory capacities; and their enhanced involvement with peer relationships and the activities of the setting. Close Relationships with Teachers and Caregivers Just as researchers have acknowl\u00ad edged the importance of nonparental caregivers within the family to the emotional well-being of young children, they have also recognized the impor\u00adtance of caregivers outside the home. Preschoolers develop strong emotional bonds with their teachers and caregiv\u00aders in early childhood settings, and although ther e is some debate about whether these should be considered \"attachments\" as the term is applied to primary family caregivers (parents or other adults raising the child), it is apparent that these close family care\u00adgiver relationships function very much like attachment relationships for chil\u00addren in early childhood settings (Berlin and Cassidy 1999; Dunn 1993; Howes 1999). Young children rely on their primary teachers or caregivers in early childhood settings in much the same manner that they rely on their fam\u00adily caregivers at home. Although these relationships are not interchangeable, and close relationships outside the home do not diminish the strength of the young child's attachments to the parents, it is apparent that both kinds of relationships are developmentally important. Young children's close relationships with pr eschool teachers and caregivers are also important to their develop\u00adment of school readiness. A number of studies have found that the warmth and security of the preschool child's relationship with a preschool teacher are predictive of the child's subse\u00adquent classroom performance, atten\u00adtional skills, and social competence in the kindergarten and primary grade classroom (Peisner-Feinberg and oth\u00aders 2001; Pianta, Nimetz, and Ben\u00adnett 1997; see Committee on Early Childhood Pedagogy 2001 and Lamb 1998 for reviews). The importance of close relationships outside the home extends to children's adaptation to school. Several studies have confirmed that young children's success in kin\u00addergarten and the primary grades is significantly influenced by the qual- Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education \u0018\u0018 ity of the teacher-child relationship and that conflict in the relationship is a predictor of children's poorer academic performance and greater behavior problems, sometimes years later (Birch and Ladd Stuhlman 2004a, 2004b). In a manner similar to the way in which successful peer relation\u00adships in the classroom contribute to children's enthusiasm for learning and classroom success, so is the teacher-child relationship a significant con\u00adtributor\u2014both before school entry and afterward. The indicators of young children's close relationships with preschool teachers and caregivers are remark\u00adably consistent with the behavioral indicators of children's attachments to their family caregivers. In both cases, the significant features are the extent to which children seek security and support from their primary preschool teachers and caregivers and the extent to which they contribute to maintain\u00ading positive relationships with those adults. Preschoolers exhibit their reli\u00adance on their primary preschool teach\u00aders through their preference to be with the adult; the adult's capacity to assist and comfort them when others cannot; their efforts to attract the teacher's positive regard (and avoid criticism by Although these relationships are not interchangeable, and close relationships outside the home do not diminish the strength of the young child's attachments to the parents, it is apparent that both kinds of relationships are developmentally important. Several studies have confirmed that young children's success in kindergarten and the primary grades is significantly influenced by the quality of the teacher-child relationship and that conflict in the relationship is a predictor of children's poorer academic performance and greater behavior problems, sometimes years later. this person); their pleasure in shared activity with the adult; and the greater ease with which they can disclose and discuss troubling topics (such as distressing experiences) with the pri\u00admary preschool teacher or caregiver. Although this similarity in behavioral indicators should not be taken to indi\u00adcate that young children's relation\u00adships with their parents are identical to their relationships with their primary preschool teachers and caregivers in early childhood settings\u2014 clearly, they are not\u2014it is important to recognize that children derive security and support from their close relation\u00adships in these settings comparable to the confidence they derive from attach\u00adment relationships at home. Friendships Our understanding of preschool children's friendships has advanced in concert with our knowledge of peer interactions, both of which reveal children's skill and sophistication in peer sociability to be greater than was earlier believed. Friendships are important to children's adaptation to school and their academic success for the same reason that successful peer interactions are important: they cause kindergarteners and elementary grade SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 \u0018\u0018 SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT children to look forward to coming to school, to have a more positive class\u00adroom experience, and to achieve more as students (Ladd, Kochenderfer, and Coleman 1996, 1997; Ladd, Birch, and Buhs 1999). Research on the friendships of pre\u00ad school children reveals that close relationships between peers tend to be stable over time; but with the children's increasing age, these friend\u00adships become more reciprocal, more exclusive (i.e., children are more likely to exclude other children from the activities they share with friends), and friends become more psychologically aware of the relationship they share (see reviews by Gottman 1983; Parker and Gottman 1989; Rubin and others Friendships become characterized by more complex play between friends and more positive and affectionate behavior. But, somewhat surprisingly, there can be greater conflict between friends than in interactions with nonfriends. 2005; Rubin, Bukowski, and Parker 2006; Vandell, Nenide, and Van Winkle 2006). Friendships become character\u00adized by more complex play between friends and more positive and affec\u00adtionate behavior. But, somewhat sur\u00adprisingly, there can be greater conflict between friends than in interactions with nonfriends. The greater incidence of conflict may derive both from the greater frequency of friendship interac\u00adtion and the greater emotional invest\u00adment in these interactions. However, toward the end of the preschool years, friends are more likely to negotiate with each other, to disengage from disagreements before conflict worsens, and to find other ways of maintaining their friendship beyond the disagree\u00adment (Gottman 1983; and Gottman 1989). In these ways, then, broader features of devel\u00adoping social and emotional compe\u00adtences in early childhood contribute to the maintenance of friendship in older preschoolers and their greater endurance over time.

SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 FOUNDATIONS IN Language and Literacy Purpose of the Language and Literacy Preschool Learning Foundations This section presents preschool learning foundations for preschool children in the central domain of language and literacy learning and development. Based on research, these preschool learning foundations identify key competencies typical of children who are making progress toward being ready for kindergarten and becoming fluent communicators and readers. The foundations describe age-appropri\u00adate knowledge and skills expected of older three-year-olds (i.e., at around 48 months of age) and of older four-year\u00adolds (i.e., at around 60 months of age). In other words, the focus of these foun\u00addations is on the language and literacy competencies of young children near the time when they are three years old going on four years old and four years old going on five years old. Although an in-depth consideration of children's language and literacy competencies during the preschool years is funda\u00admentally important, attention to this domain is best understood in the broad context of early learning and develop\u00adment. Language and literacy learning depends on children's functioning in the other domains, including social-emotional development, physical devel\u00adopment, and for English lear ners, English-language development. Many such complementary and mutu\u00adally supporting aspects of the child's overall learning and development are addressed in the learning foundations for the other domains, such as those for social-emotional development and mathematics learning. An assumption underlying the language and literacy foundations is that childr en should experience the kinds of interactions, relationships, activities, and play that research has shown to support successful learning and development. Like the foundations for the other domains, the language and literacy foundations describe learning and development that would typically be expected with appropriate support rather than presenting aspi\u00adrational expectations that would be expected only under the best possible conditions. The foundations are not intended to be assessment items. This publication is meant to be a resource and a guide to support preschool pro\u00adgrams in their efforts to foster learning in all young children. California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 47 48 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY Organization of the Language and Literacy Foundations The preschool learning foundations in language and literacy are organized into three developmental strands to align with the strands for listening and speaking, reading, and writing in the California Department of Educa\u00adtion's English-language arts content standards for kindergarten. The first strand, listening and speaking, relates primarily to language development. This strand includes the substrands of language use and conventions, vocab\u00adulary, and grammar. The other two strands relate to literacy development. The reading strand consists of the substrands of concepts about print, phonological awareness, alphabetics and word/print recognition, compre\u00adhension and analysis of age-appro\u00adpriate text, and literacy interest and response. The writing strand has one substrand: writing strategies. Within each substrand, individual foundations specify distinct compe\u00adtencies. Each substrand is divided into two columns: The column on the left-hand side focuses on childr en at around 48 months of age, and the col\u00adumn on the right-hand side focuses on children at around 60 months of age. The substrand descriptions for chil\u00addren at around 60 months of age detail more sophisticated and advanced competencies than do those for chil\u00addren at around 48 months of age. In some cases the difference between the foundations for the two age ranges is more pronounced than for the other foundations. Although two points of a developmental progression (at around 48 months of age and at around 60 months of age) are specified within each strand, the order in which the strands are presented is not meant to indicate a developmental pr ogres\u00ad sion from strand to strand. Nor is the order of presentation of the substrands within a strand meant to indicate a developmental progression from sub-strand to substrand. Both substrands and founda\u00ad tions ar e numbered sequentially. For example, if a substrand is numbered 1.0, the foundations under that sub-strand are 1.1, 1.2, and so on for both age levels; likewise, if a substrand is numbered 2.0, the foundations under that substrand are 2.1, 2.2, and so on, again for both age levels. While both substrands and foundations are num\u00adbered sequentially, the order of pre\u00adsentation does not represent a devel\u00adopmental progression. Each foundation is accompanied by examples that further illustrate the meaning of the foundation. They pr o\u00ad vide behavioral illustrations of how a child might demonstrate a competency described in a given foundation. In some instances the examples may also clarify the meaning of a foundation. However, the examples are not exhaus\u00adtive checklists or assessment items and should be used for illustrative purposes only. Following the foundations, a review of the r elevant research for each strand is presented to indicate the research basis for the foundations in that strand. This section provides the reader with a more complete expla\u00adnation of each strand. At the end of this section, a selected bibliography of research citations is provided for the entire set of language and literacy foundations. Brief explanations of the main points within the strands are provided next. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Listening and Speaking\u2014 Language Use and Conventions, Vocabulary, and Grammar The rate of children's early language growth and later language outcomes is directly related to the verbal input that children receive when communi\u00adcating with adults and other children. Detailed within the three substrands is the sequential progression of children's developing understanding of language use and conventions, vocabulary, and grammar. Language Use and Conventions. The substrand of language use and conventions covers a br oad range of knowledge and skills, including using language to communicate for a variety of purposes, using accepted language and style when communicating with adults and children, understanding and using language to communicate effectively with others, and construct\u00ading narratives with language. In pre\u00adschool, children are developing the ability to use language for a range of purposes, such as describing, request\u00ading, commenting, greeting, reasoning, problem solving, seeking new informa\u00adtion, and predicting. Children nearing four years of age are expected to gener\u00adate an appropriate response to at least one comment made during a conversa\u00adtion, and those nearing five years of age are expected to maintain a conversation for several turns. Another development in the area of language use and conventions is lear n\u00ad ing to use accepted language and style during communication. It is impor\u00adtant to note that accepted language or behavior is that which commonly occurs in the child's environment or community. For example, in some environments people make eye contact 49 when they speak, while in other com\u00ad munities they do not. At around 48 months of age, children typically can make themselves understood when they communicate with familiar adults and children. At this age they may make pronunciation errors or some\u00adtimes use words in unusual ways that are understood by people who know them, but not by people who are unfa\u00admiliar with them. As children develop, they increasingly speak in ways that most familiar and unfamiliar adults and children can understand. This development pertains to the articula\u00adtion of specific words and the expres\u00adsion of specific sounds rather than to the overall way in which children speak or whether they speak with an accent. At this age children also begin con\u00ad structing narrative by engaging in extended monologues that commu\u00adnicate to the listener an experience, a story, or something desired in the future. As children get older, such sto\u00adries become more detailed, linear, and geared toward the perspective of the listener. When children are about 48 months of age, their narratives may consist of several unrelated ideas, characters, or events. Children near five years of age begin to produce nar\u00adratives that convey a causal or tem\u00adporal sequence of events (e.g., \"After naptime we woke up. Then we had a snack and went outside. Then . . . \"). For children at the older age, the nar\u00adratives tend to be longer, make more sense, and provide more information than those of younger children. Teach\u00aders can support young children in the area of language use and conventions by repeating and extending what chil\u00addren say in conversations. Teachers can also provide opportunities for chil- LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 50 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY dren to use language for a broad range of purposes, including encouraging children to repeat or tell stories. Vocabulary. The vocabulary sub- strand represents an important tool for accessing background knowledge, expressing ideas, and acquiring new concepts. Children with large vocabu\u00adlaries can acquire new words more eas\u00adily, are more effective readers, and are more proficient in reading comprehen\u00adsion. Multiple experiences with words across a variety of contexts are critical for children's acquisition and exten\u00adsion of vocabulary. An important ele\u00adment of vocabulary development is the attainment of an increasing variety and specificity of accepted words (words that are commonly used in the chil\u00addren's environment or community) for objects, actions, and attributes used in both real and symbolic contexts. For example, many children nearing the age of four would call all dinosaurs \"dinosaurs.\" By the time children are approaching the age of five, they refer to dinosaurs with greater specificity, pointing to an Apatosaurus and saying, \"Apatosaurus,\" or pointing to a Tyran\u00adnosaurus and saying, \"Tyrannosau\u00adrus.\" Vocabulary development also con\u00ad sists of understanding and using accepted wor ds for categories of objects. At around 48 months of age, children understand and use category names they encounter frequently, such as toys, food, clothes, or animals. As children near the age of 60 months, their understanding and use of ver\u00adbal categories expands to ones they encounter less often, such as reptiles, vehicles, fruits, vegetables, and fur\u00adniture. Another important aspect of vocabulary development during the preschool years is the understanding and use of words that describe rela\u00ad tions between objects. For example, as children near 48 months of age, they use such words as under, in, and dif\u00adferent. Children at around 60 months of age continue to use simple words to describe relations between objects and add complex relational words to their vocabulary, for example, smaller, bigger, next to, and in front of. During the preschool years, children begin to use the comparative -er and the super\u00adlative -est (big, bigger, biggest; long, lon\u00adger, longest) to discriminate among the sizes of objects. Often, to promote children's vocabu\u00ad lary development, adults' language must be contextualized, or supported by the immediate context. Children can understand and express more decontextualized language as their concepts of vocabulary and language expand. They can describe concepts without the support of the immediate context and increasingly communi\u00adcate about events and actions in the past and in the future. This movement from concrete and contextualized lan\u00adguage to abstract and decontextual\u00adized language plays a critical role in children's growing comprehension of abstract ideas. Children learn much of their vocabulary and basic language concepts indirectly through their inter\u00adaction with others. They also acquire vocabulary through teacher-guided instructional activities. Grammar. The third substrand of listening and speaking, grammar, refers to the ways in which words, phrases, and sentences are struc\u00adtured and marked to make meaning in language. In preschool, children take important steps toward acquir\u00ading grammar. Preschoolers learn the rules of making basic sentences, join- Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education ing phrases and clauses to make lan\u00ad guage into more complex sentences, joining adjectives to nouns, and using verb tenses, adverbs, and other parts of speech. At around 48 months of age, children tend to convey their thoughts by using simple, short phrases that communicate only one main idea (e.g., \"I'm hungry!\" or \"Almost bed\u00adtime!\") Over time, preschool children begin producing increasingly longer compound sentences (e.g., \"It's almost bedtime and I am still hungry!\") by connecting clauses (using words such as and and but). They also begin to generate more complex sentences (e.g., \"Because I haven't eaten yet, I am still hungry\") that combine multiple phrases or concepts to communicate more sophisticated and interrelated ideas (using words such as if and because). As children develop their comprehension and use of verb mark\u00aders, such as -ed, they tend to make errors (e.g., \"I wented,\" \"He hitted\"). Errors among preschoolers in the use very common (e.g., \"Her did it,\" \"It's hims\"). Children's use of basic negative sentences between two and three years of age (e.g., \"no go,\" \"no want\") becomes increasingly precise during the preschool years (e.g., \"I don't want any\" or \"You are not going\"). Some errors in negation will be observed during the preschool years (e.g., \"I not want to do that!\"), but these errors occur less frequently as children near 60 months of age. As with the development of chil\u00ad dren's vocabulary and basic language concepts, children's ability to use increasingly sophisticated language structures allows them to make greater use of \"decontextualized language\"\u2014 language that requires little reliance on the immediate context for it to be 51 understood. Children's development of grammatical sophistication is greatly enhanced by the teacher's modeling of correct forms and providing support in play and through teacher-guided instructional activities. Reading\u2014Concepts About Print, Phonological Awareness, Alphabetics and Word/Print Recognition, Comprehension and Analysis of Age-Appropriate Text, Literacy Interest and Response Concepts About Print. Children develop concepts about print through seeing print in the environment and observing people using print for vari\u00adous purposes. Central to an under\u00adstanding of the nature and role of reading and writing is a child's under\u00adstanding of \"intentionality,\" i.e., that intentional meaning is encoded in print and print conveys a message. Children's understanding that print carries meaning often begins earlier than at preschool age, but the concept becomes increasingly sophisticated during the preschool years, and it depends largely on exposure to print and interaction with it in preschool. Preschoolers begin to use print to communicate, to understand the way print is organized in text and in books, to recite the alphabet, and to recog\u00adnize some letters and words in print. They develop sophisticated knowledge about print conventions\u2014how print is organized and how this organization changes to fit various purposes and genres. Preschool children's under\u00adstanding of print conventions supports their knowledge of the alphabet and letter recognition. The print LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 52 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY conventions preschoolers learn include directionality (e.g., the left-to-right and top-to-bottom organization of print in books and other print media in Eng\u00adlish), the way books are organized (title, author, front and back), and the way books are handled. Preschool\u00aders develop an understanding of the functions of print\u2014that it serves a number of purposes related to social and cultural contexts. In the pre\u00adschool setting, children are beginning to understand and operate within the routines and contexts where literacy instruction occurs, contexts such as reading a page and a story, writing, and drawing. This knowledge extends to routines governing the use of lit\u00aderacy in the classroom or home, such as reading stories, making lists, and writing letters. Preschool-age children also gain an understanding that print forms (e.g., words, letters, and other print units) have distinct names and are used in specific, organized ways. Knowing that the word is the basic unit of meaning in the reading and writing process is a critical transition point in children's literacy develop\u00adment. Adults can encourage children's engagement with print by explicitly focusing children's attention on print forms and functions. Phonological Awareness. Spoken language is made up of various phono\u00adlogical units that include words, sylla\u00adbles, subsyllabic units (onsets, rimes), and sounds (phonemes). \"Phonological awareness\" is generally defined as an individual's sensitivity to the sound (or phonological) structure of spoken lan\u00adguage. It is an oral language skill that does not involve print. Unlike the foun\u00addations for all the other substrands, those for phonological awareness are written only for children between four and five years of age. The focus is on this age gr oup because research indi\u00ad cates that children younger than four tend not to demonstrate this ability in reliable ways that can be read\u00adily observed. At age four, however, children begin to develop phonologi\u00adcal awareness along a developmental progression from sensitivity to large units of sound, such as phrases and words, to small units of sound, such as syllables and phonemes. Phonologi\u00adcal awareness is an important area of early and later reading instruction. It plays a direct role in several compo\u00adnents of reading, such as understand\u00ading the alphabetic principle, decoding printed words, and spelling\u2014and an indirect but important role in reading comprehension through its direct role in facilitating decoding. Children demonstrate phonological awar eness in three ways\u2014detection (matching similar sounds), synthesis (combining smaller segments into syllables and words), and analy\u00adsis (segmenting words or syllables into smaller units). Children usually develop detection skills first, then synthesis skills, followed by analysis skills. But children do not have to master one skill before they begin to acquire the next. In the foundations for phonological awareness, there is a progression from the ability to detect and blend words to the ability to seg\u00adment at the onset-rime level. Pre\u00adschoolers' development of phonological awareness depends to a great extent on the amount and kind of support provided by the teacher. For example, when asking children to delete the onset of a word, teachers can help chil\u00addren remember the word by showing pictures. The foundations for phono\u00adlogical awareness indicate which skills Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 53 are most likely to be demonstrated in the context of such teacher support, i.e., when the teacher uses pictures, props, objects, and so forth in activi\u00adties intended to support phonological awareness. Alphabetics and Word/Print Recognition. Knowing the letters of the alphabet at preschool age is related to both short- and long-term read\u00ading proficiency. Knowledge of letter names facilitates children's ability to decode text and to apply the alpha\u00adbetic principle to word recognition. For most children letter names help them connect the sounds in words and letters in print. Preschool children tend to learn first the letters that are most familiar to them, such as the let\u00adters in their own names and the let\u00adters that occur earlier in the alphabet string. As children become aware of letter names, they also start to identify printed words. Word recognition at the preschool age is mainly prealphabetic (i.e., the recognition of words by sight and by reliance on familiar cues). Chil\u00addren can recognize some words, but rarely can they examine the alphabetic or phonetic structures of the word to arrive at its meaning. Preschool chil\u00addren are able to recognize some words in the environment (e.g., Stop, Exit, and some brand names) but usually only in a familiar context. Typically, four-year-olds develop their knowl\u00adedge of the alphabet and letter-sound correspondences. Coupled with their improving phonological awareness, those children may read at partial alphabetic levels during the preschool years. They may be able to look at some unknown words and use letters and their corresponding sounds to decode the printed word. For instance, seeing the word Thomas in a book, the child may use some alphabetic infor\u00admation (e.g., the first letter T and its corresponding letter sound) to make a good guess at what it says. Comprehension and Analysis of Age-Appropriate Text. Preschool\u00ad ers' development of narrative think\u00ading goes through a series of stages that ultimately lead to their making sense of stories and the world around them. At the earliest stage, preschool\u00aders construct narrative scripts, or primitive accounts of story plots that focus on familiar events and routine activities. In the next stage, children construct narrative schemas, which include knowledge about the main ele\u00adments of stories (such as characters and settings) and about the sequence of events (such as time, order, and causal progression). Then preschool\u00aders come to understand and relate to characters' internal responses, such as their mental processes and expe\u00adriences. Ultimately, children recog\u00adnize both the external and internal features of narrative. Preschoolers' competence with narratives can be greatly expanded through instruc\u00adtional activities guided by teachers. Exposure to wordless picture books provides instructional opportunities for children and, for teachers, a window into children's learning processes. The efforts of children to make sense of the pictures when they are reading word\u00adless picture books form the foundation for reading comprehension and mak\u00ading meaning. Storybook reading, both of wordless picture books and regular books, when combined with interac\u00adtive language activities, such as active discussion of stories, before, during, and after reading, enhances children's understanding and recall of stories. Shared reading activities allow teach- LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY 54 ers to model key components of the reading task and enable children to begin discovering the components of reading themselves. Interaction during shared reading creates opportunities for cognitive processing and problem solving. Literacy Interest and Response. Interest in books and a positive regard for reading are important developmen\u00adtal accomplishments for preschool-age children. Participation in such literacy activities as handling books and listening to stories leads to continuing engagement with text and to motiva\u00adtion and persistence in challenging reading tasks. These experiences are necessary for children to become able readers and lifelong literacy learners. An emerging body of research shows that motivation is an important factor in the development of early literacy in preschool and later read\u00ading achievement. Increasing engage\u00adment in literacy and expanding read\u00ading activities are tied to increases in motivation, which, in turn, facilitates comprehension and recall of informa\u00adtion. Children's active engagement in text-related activities, such as turning pages in a book, is related to knowl\u00adedge of print concepts at around four years of age. Opportunities for read\u00ading are related to children's interest in reading at home and at school. Children who are read to more fre\u00adquently and from an earlier age tend to have greater interest in literacy, exhibit superior literacy skills during the preschool and school years, choose reading more frequently, initiate read\u00ading sessions on their own, and show greater engagement during reading sessions. Adult-child storybook read\u00ading promotes children's interest in reading and leads to increased exposur e and engagement with text. Writing\u2014Writing Strategies Writing Strategies. Learning to write involves cognitive, social, and physical development. Children from a very young age notice writing in their surroundings. They begin to under\u00adstand that signs in the environment represent words for ideas or concepts. By age three they begin to differenti\u00adate between writing and other kinds of visual representation, such as draw\u00ading. With this realization comes dif\u00adferentiation between tools for writing and tools for drawing (\"I need to get a pencil to write my name\"). Their writ\u00ading starts to look different from their drawing\u2014more linear than circular. Young children become involved with written text by being read to, examin\u00ading books, and observing others writ\u00ading. Preschoolers begin to experiment with writing by pretending to write and by learning to write their names. Initially, children demonstrate a global form of writing. They tend to use draw\u00adings as writing or use idiosyncratic scribbles (i.e., markings that have only personal meaning). Later, children use letter-like forms that resemble some of the characteristics of real writing (e.g., longer words are represented by longer strings of letter-like symbols). Children in the next phase start using actual letters to write, but with little or no connection to the actual spelling of what they want to write (i.e., non-phonetic strings of letters). This phase is followed by attempts at phonetic spelling, also called \"invented spelling.\" In this phase, children use letters to match letter sounds to parts of words they hear, but from a phonological Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 55 rather than an orthographic perspec\u00ad tive. Children may recognize that writing the word they are thinking of requires more than one or two symbols and that the same symbols may be in dif\u00adferent words or in different places in the same word, but they have not yet mastered the alphabetic principle. Even so, invented spelling is an effec\u00adtive vehicle through which many chil\u00addren begin to understand the alpha\u00adbetic principle. It also helps childr en realize that writing carries meaning, that other people should be able to read what they write, and that people write for different purposes. Children who have the physical experience of writing in this way begin to develop ways of handling writing implements, but they need support from adults in learning to do so.

Examples Examples Describing The child says, \"It was big and green and scary.\" Requesting The child asks, \"Can I have mor e play dough?\" while in the art ar ea. Commenting The child says, \"This is my blanket.\" Acknowledging The child indicates, \"Me too.\" Gr eeting The child says, \"Hi, Mrs. Franklin,\" when entering the r oom. Rejecting The child says, \"I don' t want to clean up blocks\" during clean-up time. The child's speech may contain pronunciation errors that ar e understood by familiar adults and children, but those errors would be difficult for a visitor to the classroom to understand. The child may speak using some idiosyncratic words that ar e understood by familiar adults and peers but not by unfamiliar adults (e.g., Bryan calls his blanket a \"wobie\"). Reasoning The child says, \"I think we can go outside because it's sunny now\" or \"I don' t need my coat because it's not windy.\" Predicting The child says, \"I think that bear's going to get lost!\" or \"If it keeps raining I think the worms will come out.\" Problem solving The child says, \"Maybe we can put the milk in here and then it will be cookie dough.\" Seeking new information The child asks, \"Why isn't Jerome at school?\" or \"Why ar e you dr essed up? Where are you going?\" The child generally speaks with correct pronuncia\u00adtion, although some continuing speech err ors ar e age-appropriate. Most of the child's speech is free of speech errors. Most listeners do not have to ask the child to repeat himself or herself by asking, \"What did you say?\" Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Listening and Speaking | 57 1.0 Language Use and Conventions (Continued) At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age 1.3 Use accepted language and style during communication with familiar adults and children. 1.3 Use accepted language and style during communication with both familiar and unfamiliar adults and children. Examples Examples The child responds on the topic for at least one turn in a conversation. For example, the child responds, \"Me too. I got new shoes,\" following a peer's comment, \"I got new shoes,\" while playing in the dress-up area. The child adjusts the form and style of language use accor ding to the listener's status or compe- tence. For example, asks the teacher, \"Can I please have that paintbrush,\" but tells peer, \"Give me that paintbrush,\" or speaks slowly and deliberately to a younger child. The child often uses appropriate nonverbal standar ds in conversation with others (e.g., eye contact, distance to conversational partner, facial expressions). The child often uses polite forms of communica\u00adtion as appr opriate (e.g., says thank you, please, addresses adults as Mr., Mrs., or Ms.). The child often uses volume and intonation appr opriate for a situation when speaking. For example, speaks quietly to the teacher while the other children are napping or speaks in a slower and quieter tone while expressing regret (e.g., \"I'm sorry I broke it\"). The child responds on topic across several turns in conversation. For example, during dramatic play , the child says, \"I'm the baby and I'm hungry.\" A friend responds, \"Okay, I'll cook you breakfast.\" The child responds, \"Then you're the mommy and you're cooking the breakfast.\" A friend responds, \"I'm going to make pancakes.\" The child adjusts the form and style of language use accor ding to the listener's status, competence, or knowledge. For example, during a field trip to the fire station, tells a firefighter, \"Wow! That's neat. Can I hold it?\" but tells a peer, \"I want to see!\" While talking with older brother, prefaces the description of the fire truck and equipment by stating that the class went on a field trip to the fire station that day. The child consistently uses appropriate nonverbal standar ds in conversation with others (e.g., eye contact, distance to conversational partner, facial expressions). The child typically uses polite forms of communi\u00adcation as appr opriate (e.g., says thank you, please, addresses adults as Mr., Mrs., or Ms.). The child typically uses volume and intonation appr opriate for a situation when speaking. For example, uses a quieter voice inside the classroom than on the playground.

The baby birds flew away.\" The child describes an unfolding event at snack time: \"I want to put peanut butter on my br ead. I'm going to put jelly on, too.\" The child relays events from the day's morning: \"My daddy' s truck broke down. We walked to school. It was a long way.\" The child tells a brief story that unfolds over time: \"I went to the park with my mommy , and we played in the sandbox. Then we had a picnic. After that, we went to the store.\" The child tells about activities of interest to him or her that day: \"First we come to school and sit on the carpet. Then we have our cir cle time. And then we do the centers. And then it's time for lunch.\" The child retells the major events of a favorite story: \"The boy wr ote to the zoo, and they kept sending him animals. But he doesn't like them. So, then he gets a puppy, and he keeps it. He was happy then.\" LANGUAGE AND LITERACY * Producing narratives may vary at these ages for children who are communicating with sign language or alternative communication systems. As is true for all children, teachers can support young children's communication knowledge and skills by repeating and extending what children communicate in conversations. Teachers can also provide opportunities for children to repeat or tell stories as a way to encourage them to produce narratives.

Examples Examples When holding a book, the child orients it as if to read. The child can point to where the title is shown on the cover of a book. The child opens a book and turns the pages in a single direction, although not necessarily one page at a time. The child orients a book correctly for reading (i.e., right-side up with the front cover facing the child). The child turns the pages of a book one at a time. The child begins to track print from left to right and top to bottom (e.g., while pretending to read a story to a peer or doll). While looking through a book, the child says, \"the end\" after reaching the last page. 1.2 Recognize print as something that can be read.* 1.2 Understand that print is something that is read and has specific meaning.* Examples Examples The child points to letters in a book, on a sign, or on a drawing and communicates, \"that says my name,\" although usually inaccurately.

With each push of the swing, the teacher says one part of a compound word (e.g., sun, shine) and then asks the child, \"What's that word?\" The child responds, \"Sunshine.\" While playing in the dramatic play area, the child responds, \"hairbrush\" when asked, \"What word do you get when you say 'hair' and 'brush' together?\" Orally puts together the two syllables of two-syllable words that are familiar to the child. During mealtime conversation, the child partici\u00ad pates in the guess-the-food (ta-co, su-shi, crack-er, ap-ple, but-ter) and says each syllable distinctly. The teacher asks, \"What food is this?\" The child responds, \"Taco.\" The child chants, \"sister\" after singing along to, \"What word do you get when you say 'sis' and 'ter' together?\" The child responds, \"Amit\" in unison with other classmates during circle time when the teacher says, \"I'm thinking of a classmate's name that has two parts, like 'A-mit.' Whose name is that?\" * \"Phonological awareness\" is defined for the preschool learning foundations as an oral language skill: an individual's sensitivity to the sound (or phonological) structure of spoken language. Phonological awareness is an important skill that children start to acquire during preschool and continue to build in early elementary school as they learn to read. Even though it is defined as an oral language skill, it is also an important skill for children who are deaf or hard of hearing. A teacher of the deaf should be consulted for strategies for facilitating phonological awareness in individual children who are deaf or hard of hearing. Some children may need assistance in holding a book or turning the pages, either through assistive technology or through the help of an adult or a peer. For example, a book can be mounted so that it does not have to be held, and sturdy tabs can be placed on the pages so that they are easier to turn. Some children may need to have an adult or a peer hold the book and turn the pages. The foundations for phonological awareness are written only for older four-year-olds because much of the initial development of phonological awareness occurs between 48 months and 60 months of age. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Reading | 65 2.0 Phonological Awareness (Continued) At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age Examples (Continued) Orally takes apart compound words into their component wor ds. The child claps out words in a compound word as part of a cir cle time activity. When the teacher says, \"When I think of the word 'book,' I think of clapping one time. Other words like 'bookshelf' have two parts. So I clap two times. Let's clap out the parts for 'paintbrush.'\" The child responds, \"table\" when asked, \"What wor d do you get when you say 'tablecloth' with\u00ad out 'cloth'?\" The child responds, \"ball\" when asked, \"What wor d do you get when you say 'football' without 'foot'?\" The child responds, \"mail\" and \"box\" when asked, \"What two wor ds make 'mailbox'?\" Orally takes apart two-syllable words into their component syllables. The child claps out syllables in a two-syllable wor d as part of a circle time activity. When the teacher says, \"Let's clap out how many parts we hear in the word 'cook-ie.'\" The child responds, \"door\" when asked, \"What wor d do you get when you say 'doorknob' without 'knob'?\" LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 66 | Reading 2.0 Phonological Awareness (Continued) At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age LANGUAGE AND LITERACY 2.2 Orally blend the onsets, rimes, and phonemes of words and orally delete the onsets of words, with the support of pictures or objects.* Examples Orally blends the onsets and rimes of words with the support of pictures or objects. During a small group activity with several objects on the table (e.g., cat, cup, mat, bus, rat, pup), the child responds and selects the rat (or says \"rat\") when a teacher asks, \"Ricardo, can you find the r\u2014at?\" While playing a game of I-spy, the teacher says, \"I spy a s\u2014un,\" and the child indicates or points to the sun or says, \"sun.\" While engaged in a game, the child selects the picture of a bed from among three or four pic\u00adtures (or says, \"bed\") when asked to put together the letter sounds b\u2014ed . Deletes the onset from a spoken word with the support of pictures or objects. The child selects the picture of ants from among three or four pictures (or says, \"ants\") when asked to say \"pants\" without the \"p\" letter sound. Orally blends individual phonemes to make a simple word with the support of pictures or objects. While playing a \"bingo game\" during small group time, the child chooses and marks pictures corresponding to the words for which the teacher sounds out the individual phonemes (e.g., h\u2014a\u2014t, m\u2014o\u2014p, c\u2014u\u2014p). The teacher sings, \"If you think you know the word, shout it out. If you think you know the word, tell me what you've heard. If you think you know the word, shout it out . . . s\u2014i\u2014t.\" The child sings out \"sit\" along with the classmates. The child picks up the picture of a hat from among three or four pictures (or says, \"hat\") when asked to put together the letter sounds h\u2014a\u2014t. * The foundations for phonological awareness are written only for older four-year-olds because much of the initial development of phonological awareness occurs between 48 months and 60 months of age.

Examples Examples Kavita communicates, \"That's my name\" while indicating the letter K on Karen's name card on the helper chart. Bobby indicates a word beginning with the letter B and says, \"That's my letter.\" The child responds appropriately when the teacher holds up a card with the first letter of his or her name and says, \"Everyone whose name begins with this letter (the first letter of the child's name), put on your jacket.\" The child recognizes his or her name on a sign-in sheet, helper chart, artwork, or name tag (e.g., name tag, label for the cubby, or place at the table). The child recognizes common or familiar words (e.g., mom or friends' names) in print. 3.2 Match some letter names to their printed form. 3.2 Match more than half of uppercase letter names and more than half of lowercase letter names to their printed form. Examples Examples LANGUAGE AND LITERACY When putting the \"T\" puzzle piece into the alphabet puzzle, the child says, \"That's a T.\" The child traces over sandpaper letters, saying the matching letter name for some letters. The child names some letters in storybooks, logos, or on artwork. The child says, \"I want all the A's,\" when sorting thr ough a container of letters, picking out the A shapes. When shown an upper- or lowercase letter, the child can say its name. The child says letter names when attending to dif ferent words, such as own name, friends' names, or frequently seen signs. During circle time the child indicates or points to the corr ect letter on a chart when the teacher prompts with the name of the letter. 3.3 Begin to recognize that letters have sounds. Examples The child makes the correct sound for the first letter in his name. The child says the correct letter sound while pointing to the letter in a book. The child indicates the correct picture when pre\u00ad sented with four pictures\u2014dog barking, car horn honking, letter k, and letter n\u2014and asked, \"Which of these make these sounds: bow-wow, honk, \"k\" (letter sound), \"n\" (letter sound)?\" * Children with oral motor involvement, who may have difficulty in saying words or syllables as they learn to match, synthesize, or analyze syllables and sounds, may demonstrate their knowledge by indicating yes or no in response to an adult's production of sounds or words or by identifying pictures that represent the products of these manipulations. It should be understood that children can learn letters of the alphabet and about print without being able to see typical print. Multiple means of recognizing print include the use of tactile letters, large print, color contrast or lighting, braille, and any other means of representing letters and print.

The child writes marks and refers to them as \"my name\" or \"this is my name.\" The child holds a pencil or pen with finger grasp to write. The child draws recognizable figures, letters, or shapes. The child child moves hand to hold paper in place while drawing or writing. The child draws a picture and writes a label (may not be r eadable). The child writes strings of symbols that look like letters or writes actual letters, which can vary in dir ectionality (not necessarily left to right). The child writes own name with or without mistakes, for example: - Excludes some letters (dvid). - Reverses some letters (Davib). - Uses letters that may not be written in a line. * Some children may need assistance in emergent writing, either through assistive technology or through the help of an adult. Assistive technology (either low tech or high tech) may be as simple as building up the width of the marker or pencil so that it is easier to grasp, or it may be as sophisticated as using a computer. Another possibility would be for an adult or a peer to \"write\" for the child who would then approve or disapprove by indicating yes or no. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 71 Bibliographic Notes Listening and Speaking Language Use and Conventions. The development of oral language is one of the most impressive accom\u00adplishments that occur during the first five years of children's lives (Genishi 1988). Oral language development results from the interaction of a variety of factors, including social, linguistic, maturational/biological, and cognitive influences, and these factors interact and modify one another (Bohannon and Bonvillian 2001). Research indi\u00adcates that social factors have a promi\u00adnent role on oral language develop\u00adment. For example, the wide variation in the rate of children's early language growth and later language outcomes is directly related to differences in maternal and other caretakers' verbal input (Baumwell, Tamis-LeMonda, and Baumwell 2001). language use and conventions substrand focuses on childr en's use of language for social and commu\u00adnicative purposes. Four aspects of language use are emphasized in the foundations: using language to com\u00admunicate with others for a variety of purposes, increasing clarity of com\u00admunication (i.e., phonology), develop\u00ading an increasing understanding of the conventions of language use (i.e., prag\u00admatics), and using language for narra\u00adtive purposes. The first component of the foundation emphasizes the child's ability to use language for a variety of dif ferent purposes. Each time chil\u00ad dren produce language, an intention is being expressed. As children develop their language abilities during early childhood, the range of intentions they express expands. They use language not just to request, reject, and com\u00adment, but to acknowledge, to greet, to understand, to solve problems, to hypothesize, to regulate, and to describe, among other uses. The second component centers on the ability of young childr en to learn to use understandable pronunciation and words. This development pertains to the articulation of specific words and the expression of specific sounds rather than to the overall way in which children speak or whether they speak with an accent. Young children may speak in ways that may contain pro\u00adnunciation errors and idiosyncratic words. Usually their communication is understood by familiar adults and chil\u00addren. As children continue to develop, they usually speak with clear pronun\u00adciation and use common words. Their speech is usually understood by both familiar and unfamiliar adults and children. The third component of the founda\u00ad tion focuses on childr en's increasing understanding of the conventions of communication, including conversa\u00adtional participation and the ability to sustain a topic over turns, and the use of appropriate verbal and nonverbal communicative behaviors, including adapting language based on communi\u00adcative partners and situations. LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 72 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY It is important to note that appropri\u00ad ate (or accepted) language or behavior is that which commonly occurs in the child's environment or community. For example, in some communities or environments, people make eye con\u00adtact when they speak, while in other communities they do not. In the first few years of life, children are not very skilled conversationalists, only able to (typically) maintain a conversational focus for one or two turns. As children become older and near the end of the preschool years, they can maintain a conversation for several turns and take on more of the responsibility of main\u00adtaining a conversational focus. Also, as children become older, they develop an increasingly sophisticated understand\u00ading of the pragmatics of communica\u00adtion, or the social rules that govern the use of language and other communica\u00adtive behaviors. The fourth component of the founda\u00ad tion emphasizes the child's ability to use language for narrative purposes. With narrative, the child's task is, essentially, to produce an \"extended monologue\" as she relays an experi\u00adence she had, a story she has devel\u00adoped, or something she wants to do in the future. Narratives include both real events (the personal narrative) as well as fictional or imagined events (the fictional narrative). There are clear developmental changes in narrative production as children mature during the preschool years (Umiker-Sebeok 1979). Children at three years of age may produce narratives organized as a series of unrelated actions or charac\u00adters (e.g., \"the bear, the cat, the gorilla, the end\"). At around 48 months of age, children begin to organize narratives to follow a causal or temporal sequence of events (e.g., \"The bear was angry because her babies woke her up. And then . . .\"). The narratives of four - and five-year-old children tend to be longer and contain more information than those of three-year-olds (Curenton and Justice 2004). They contain more mul\u00adticlausal sentences, more words, and a greater diversity of words. At the same time, children's narratives become more coherent as children develop and become less likely to omit key informa\u00adtion that the listener needs to follow the events (Gutierrez-Clellen and Igle\u00adsias 1992; Peterson 1990). Teachers can help children to develop the dif ferent aspects of con\u00ad versation described previously. For instance, teachers can provide oppor\u00adtunities for all children to develop and apply a range of communication inten\u00adtions. Teachers can develop skills in maintaining a conversational focus by repeating what children say and 2002). Additionally, teachers can both model and promote the use of the appropriate social conventions of language. Finally, teachers can support children's nar\u00adrative comprehension\u2014which involves the ability to negotiate vocabulary, grammar, and background knowledge on the subject, to process information, to engage their phonological memory (Baddeley 1986), and when produc\u00ading a narrative, to take into account the listener's needs. Teachers can elicit children's demonstration of pho\u00adnological memory by requesting that children produce immediate recalls of verbally presented material (Lonigan 2004). Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 73 Vocabulary. The development of vocabulary is one of the most essen\u00ad tial, observable, and robust aspects of early language acquisition. Vocabulary knowledge is an important language tool that children use to access back\u00adground knowledge, express ideas, and acquire new concepts. In addition to providing children with a tool that supports peer relationships and their interactions with adults, the size of a child's vocabulary is itself a positive influence on word learning. Children who have a larger vocabulary have an easier time acquiring new words (Nash and Donaldson 2005; S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, Thomas, and Monker 1995). They also tend to be more effective readers, mas\u00adtering a wider variety of strategies to figure out the meaning of new words than less capable readers can (McK\u00adeown 1985), and are more proficient in reading comprehension (Report of the National Reading Panel 2000). On the contrary, preschool and kinder\u00adgarten children who show difficulties with vocabulary exhibit relatively lower reading achievement later (Cunning\u00adham and Stanovich 1998; Share and others 1984; Stanovich, Cunningham, and Freeman 1984). The differences in vocabulary words between high and low achievers are stable over time. Vocabulary growth throughout early childhood occurs at a very rapid rate. This process continues throughout school, where children acquire from 3,000 to 5,000 new words each aca\u00addemic year, with about half of those words learned through reading (Nagy and Herman 1987). It is thus impor\u00adtant to pay attention to vocabulary development from an early age. The vocabulary substrand includes three interrelated foundations: age-appropri\u00adate vocabulary, basic concepts, and vocabulary that describes relations between objects. Vocabulary undergoes rapid growth during the pr eschool years. Many chil\u00ad dren enter into a period termed the \"vocabulary explosion\" or \"word spurt\" within the second year of life (Bates, Bretherton, and Snyder 1988). Vocab\u00adulary acquisition is not merely add\u00ading new words in a serial fashion to a static and established vocabulary base. Learning new vocabulary is a more complex process that involves altering and refining the semantic representa\u00adtion of words already in the children's vocabulary base, as well as the rela\u00adtionships among them (Landauer and Dumais 1997; Woodward, Markham, and Fitzsimmons 1994). Children's development of the meaning of a single word is best viewed as a gradual pro\u00adcess in which word representations progressively develop from immature, incomplete representations to mature, accurate representations (Justice, Meier, and Walpole 2005). Children often can acquire a general representa\u00adtion of a new word with only a single exposure through a process called \"fast mapping\" (see McGregor and oth\u00aders 2002). This process is followed by \"slow mapping,\" during which repre\u00adsentations are gradually refined over time with multiple exposures (Curtis 1987). Thus, multiple experiences with words across a variety of contexts are critical for children's acquisition of a fine-grained representation of those words. An important aspect of early vocabu\u00ad lary and linguistic concept develop\u00adment is that of \"categorization\" (Hof f 2005). \"Vocabulary development\" can be defined as the child's ongoing achievement of increasingly precise ways of representing the contents of LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 74 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY the world. As children develop new words, those words naturally fall into different categories, such as words that describe food items, different ani\u00admals, and family members. During the preschool years, as children gradually expand their use and understanding of words within a category, they also learn the \"superordinate terms\" (the names of the categories) by which to group these words. Examples of super\u00adordinate terms often acquired during the preschool years are colors, animals, shapes, family members, friends, bugs, toys, and vegetables (Owens 1999). As children grow and are exposed to a range of new experiences, they learn words from across a variety of gram\u00admatical classes and from a range of \"ontological categories\" (Clark 1993). These categories include objects, actions, events, relations, states and properties. Relating words and con\u00adcepts within these ontological catego\u00adries helps the children create meaning within their environment. Another important element of vocab\u00ad ulary development is the attainment of a core group of terms that describe relations between objects. Young children's vocabulary becomes increas\u00adingly refined to show an understanding of and relay information about posi\u00adtion and location (e.g., in, on, under, above), amount, and size (e.g., small, big, huge). For instance, three- and four-year-old children are able to produce and comprehend locational terms, such as in, on, above, below, in front, of, next to, under, underneath, and beside (see Owens 1996). Dur\u00ading the same period, they also begin to use terms that specify amounts, such as more, less, all, and none, and physical relationships among objects on the basis of size and texture, such as hard/soft, big/little, and short/tall. Thr ee- and four-year-old children also begin to use the comparative -er and the superlative -est (big, bigger, big\u00adgest; long, longer, longest) to be dis\u00adcriminating about the sizes of objects. The superlative form usually emerges before the comparative form, so that children use and understand terms like longest and largest before they do the terms longer and larger (Owens 1996). Also, children's accuracy in comprehension of such terms tends to precede their use. The development of an extensive vocabulary pr ovides children with more sophisticated and precise ways to represent the world around them through the use of language. In the first few years of life, the language of children is developed enough to allow them to describe the immedi\u00adate world\u2014the persons, objects, and events in the immediate vicinity. Often, children's language must be contex\u00adtualized, or supported by the immedi\u00adate context. As their vocabulary and language concepts expand, children can be more decontextualized in their language use and comprehension. This movement from the concrete and con\u00adtextualized to the abstract and decon\u00adtextualized plays a critical role in the development of \"academic language\" (also called literate language) (see Curenton and Justice 2004) and the vocabulary used to produce and com\u00adprehend the relatively abstract content of written language. Use of an \"aca\u00addemic language style\" helps children to represent explicitly and precisely the world around them through the use of language and allows them to com\u00admunicate effectively in the type of lan\u00adguage most commonly used in school settings (Charity, Scarborough, and Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 75 Griffin 2004; Dickinson and Snow 1987; Dickinson and Tabors 1991; Snow 1983). Children learn much of their vocab\u00ad ulary and basic language concepts indirectly through their interaction with others, especially adults (Cun\u00adningham and Stanovich 1998; Hayes and Ahrens 1988; Miller and Gildea 1987; Nagy and Anderson 1984; Nagy, Herman, and Anderson 1985; Nagy and Herman1987; Sternberg 1987; Swanborn and De Glopper 1999). Children also acquire vocabulary through direct, explicit instruction. For example, Biemiller (1999) and Stahl (1999) reviewed several studies and found that children can acquire and retain two or three words a day through instruction involving contex\u00adtualized introduction and explanation of new words. Other researchers have also found that direct and explicit approaches are effective in increas\u00ading children's vocabulary (see Elley 1989; Feitelson, Kita, and Goldstein Whitehurst and others 1988). With adequate instruction most chil\u00addren can acquire new vocabulary at rates necessary to reach \"grade level\" vocabulary by the middle years in elementary school (Biemiller 2001). For example, Hart and Risley (1995) found that when teachers provided 40 or more hours of rich linguistic interactions per week, children were able to perform linguistic tasks at the expected level. Similarly, Landry's study (in press) demonstrates that par\u00adents who do not frequently engage in quality conversations with their chil\u00addren can be coached to support their children's language and literacy skills more effectively. Grammar. During the first five years of a child's life, language acquisition develops towar d an adult-like gram\u00ad mar. \"Grammar\" refers to the way in which phrases and sentences are structured to make meaning. Children seem to have an innate propensity toward learning the grammatical rules that govern their language. The gram\u00admatical rules include the organization of basic sentences (e.g., subject + verb + object: Juan drew the picture) and the joining of clauses and phrases to elaborate the basic sentence struc\u00adture (e.g., subject + verb + object and subject + verb + object: Juan drew the picture and he is hanging it) (Chomsky 1957). Grammar also provides rules about the way in which nouns can be elaborated with determiners and adjec\u00adtives (e.g., the big brown dog), verbs can be elaborated to share information about time (e.g., will be running), and phrases can be created for prepositions (e.g., on the table), adverbs (e.g., very, very slowly), and other parts of speech. Between the second and fifth year of life, children master virtually all the rules required for an adult-like gram\u00admar and can comprehend and produce sentences with embedded clauses (e.g., \"That boy who came today is my friend\"), as well as sentences with multiple subjects and predicates (e.g., \"I am going and then he will get me\"). The rate at which children achieve syntactic precision, however, varies from child to child (Chapman 2000). The proportion of complex sentences contained in children's language use ranges from 5 percent to 30 percent (Huttenlocher and others 2002). This variability in the rate of growth has been linked to children's experiences LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY 76 in hearing complex sentences from their teachers (Huttenlocher and oth\u00aders 2002). The foundations are organized to emphasize the child's grammatical accomplishments at both the sentence and the word levels. Sentence-level accomplishments relate to the child's use and production of increasingly complex and longer sentences. Word-level accomplishments relate to the child's manipulation of word structure for grammatical purposes. One foundation emphasizes chil\u00ad dren's grammatical accomplishments at the sentence level. Typically, the sentences of three-year-old children average about 3.5 words, and those of four-year-olds increase to about five words in length. (Brown 1973). While the increase in the length of sentences is not dramatic, there is a significant increase in the internal complexity of the sentences children are producing. By two years of age, children begin to produce simple sentences that include a noun + predicate (e.g., \"doggy sit,\" \"mommy work\"). Later, children begin to elaborate nouns by making noun phrases (e.g., \"the big brown doggy,\" \"my mommy,\" \"my daddy's gloves\"). By four years of age, children commonly produce elaborated noun phrases that include determiners (e.g., the, a, an, all, both, one, two) and adjectives (e.g., green, little, fast, angry). This increase in complexity allows children to be highly precise in their language use (e.g., \"I want that little green one over there\"). A related development centers on children's ability to produce nega\u00adtive sentences. Children's use of basic negative sentences during the second year (e.g., \"no go,\" \"no want\") becomes more precisely stated between ages three and four. Typically, these nega\u00adtive sentences include a fully inflected verb structure, as in, \"I don't want any\" and \"You are not going.\" Some errors in negation will be seen during the preschool age (e.g., \"I do want to do that!\"), but these errors will become less frequent by four and five years of age as children achieve grammatical mastery (see Hoff 2004; Owens 1996). As children near three years of age, they begin to organize phrases and clauses to produce compound sen\u00adtences (e.g., \"I want the cupcake and I want the cake, too\") and complex sentences (e.g., \"La'Kori is my friend because we go to school together\"). Children typically begin producing compound sentences (conjoined with but, so, or, and and) by three years of age and then start to conjoin clauses to form complex sentences (using if and because) soon thereafter (Brown 1973). By four years of age, most children have become skilled at both clausal embedding and clausal conjoining. \"Clausal embedding\" occurs when a dependent clause is embedded within an independent clause, as with, \"Jose, who is two, is not yet talking\" (here, the clause \"who is two\" is embedded into another clause). \"Clausal con\u00adjoining\" occurs when children link clauses, as in, \"He took my toy, but I didn't want it\" and \"When I am four, I can chew gum.\" At four years up to one-third of children's sentences will be complex (Huttenlocher and others 2002), with the remainder being sim\u00adple. In addition, by four years of age, children are typically able to produce complex-compound sentences that include the conjoining of two sentences using and or but as well as clauses embedded within the sentences (e.g., \"I will go because she said to but I Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 77 don't really want to\") (Curenton and Justice 2004). Word-level accomplishments relate to the child's manipulation of word structure for grammatical purposes. Between two and five years of age, children acquire the ability to inflect words to be more precise in meaning. For instance, one of the earliest word-structure achievements (by about two years of age) is inflecting verbs with the -ing marker to denote present pro\u00adgressive, as in \"cat jumping\" (Brown 1973). By three years of age, children are using the past tense -ed marker to denote events occurring in the past, as in, \"I walked\" (Brown 1973). As chil\u00addren develop their comprehension and use of these verb inflections, they tend to make errors, as in \"He going\" (in which the auxiliary verb is is omitted), \"I wented,\" or \"He hitted\" (in which the -ed marker is added to an irregular past tense verb that does not take the -ed), and Carlos \"walkded\" (in which the -ed marker is added twice). Such errors are entirely commonplace and typical in early grammatical acquisi\u00adtion and will gradually be replaced with more accurate use (Brown 1973). By five years of age, children are quite accurate in their inflections of verbs for past tense, present progressive tense, and future tense (Brown 1973). It is important to note that some dia\u00adlectical variations in the United States affect verb inflections. For instance, children who speak some variations of African-American English may omit the plural marker (e.g., two dollar) or modify the future tense (e.g., \"She be mad\") in ways that differ from Stan\u00addard American English but are wholly appropriate to the individual's dialect (Owens 1996). Another type of word-level achieve\u00ad ment emphasized in the foundations is the child's development of pronouns. \"Pronouns\" are grammatical structures that serve in the place of nouns. They include subject pronouns (I, you, he, she, they), object pronouns (me, you, him, her, them), possessive pronouns (hers, his, theirs), reflexive pronouns (myself, herself), and demonstrative pronouns (this, that, those). Typically, children first develop the pronouns to refer to self (I, me, mine, my) between 18 and 24 months of age (see Owens 1996). Between 24 months and five years of age, children gradually master the other pronouns to include a vari\u00adety of subject, object, possessive, and reflexive pronouns. Errors in usage are very common as children develop their skills with pronouns, such as, \"Her did it\" and \"It's hims\" (Owens 1996). With experience and development children will typically show few difficulties with pronouns by the end of the preschool period. As indicated concerning the devel\u00ad opment of children's vocabulary, children's ability to use increasingly sophisticated language structures allows them to make greater use of \"decontextualized language\"\u2014 language that requires little reliance on the context for it to be understood. By contrast, \"contextualized language\" requires context to aid in understand\u00ading. For example, contrast the two sen\u00adtences: \"He took it\" and \"That boy over there took my green ball.\" Obviously, the latter example requires much less context for it to be understood; like\u00adwise, the latter example also places a great burden on the speaker to be linguistically precise. This level of linguistic precision, required in decon- LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY 78 textualized situations, is referred to as \"literate language\" (Curenton and Justice 2004). Key markers of liter\u00adate language include use of elabo\u00adrated noun phrases (e.g., my green ball), conjunctions (when, because), and adverbs (tomorrow, slowly). As children develop literate language, they can decrease their reliance on immediate context as a tool for com\u00admunication. This ability is essential in preparing young children for school, where decontextualized language is highly valued and used, and it has also proven to be an important facilitator of later reading comprehension (Dick\u00adinson and Snow 1987; Dickinson Tabors 1991; Snow 1983). Children's semantic (vocabulary) and syntactic (grammar) abilities become especially important in the later stages of learning to read (Bishop and Adams 1990; Bowey 1986; Demont and Tanzman 1991; Whitehurst and Lonigan 1998). These abilities are particularly relevant when children try to comprehend units of text larger than individual words (Mason 1992; Nation and Snowling 1998; Snow and others 1991; Whitehurst 1997). Thus, it is important for preschool children to continue building their semantic and syntactic abilities to facilitate their learning later in the sequence of learning to read. Reading Concepts About Print. An impor\u00ad tant element to the development of emergent literacy is preschool children's development of a sophisti\u00adcated knowledge of how print works. Children's development of this knowledge is enhanced by their explicit and implicit exposure to literacy practices within their homes, class\u00adrooms, and communities (Ferreiro and Teale 1987). Children develop an under\u00adstanding of print from television and other media exposure and from more traditional types of public literacy\u2014like magazines, comics, newspapers, and billboards (Harste, Woodward, and Burke 1984; Holdaway 1986). Most important, children develop an aware\u00adness of concepts about print as they experience people around them using the printed word for many purposes. Children also learn about the purposes of print from labels, signs, and other kinds of print that they see around them (Neuman and Roskos 1993). This exposure to print is key not only to developing preschool children's concepts about print, but also to pro\u00adviding the foundation of processes and knowledge bases that facilitate writing, reading, and reading com\u00adprehension, such as vocabulary and declarative knowledge (Adams 1990; Mason 1980; Stanovich and Cunning\u00adham 1992, 1993; West and Stanovich 1991). Children's understanding of concepts about print has been shown to be associated with later reading per\u00adformance (Adams 1990; Badian 2001; Clay 1993; Preventing Reading 1998; Stuart 1995; Tunmer, Herriman, and Nesdale 1988). Central to an understanding of the natur e and role of reading and writing is a child's understanding of \"inten\u00adtionality\" (Purcell-Gates and Dahl 1991). That is, children need to Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 79 recognize that print carries mean- ing\u2014that a meaning or message is encoded (Purcell-Gates 1996). When a child understands intentionality, meaning and understanding become a background for all subsequent learn\u00ading. Failure to develop this awareness is one characteristic of delayed reading development (Clay 1985; Purcell-Gates and Dahl 1991). Children's under\u00adstanding that print carries meaning emerges between the second and fifth year of life, depending on the extent to which children interact with and are exposed to print (Mason 1980). This understanding becomes increasingly sophisticated during the preschool years (Justice and Ezell 2000). At this time, children begin to use print to communicate, to understand the way print is organized in books and other texts, to recite the alphabet, and to recognize some letters and words in print. The first aspect of this substrand, print conventions, describes children's growing knowledge of the ways in which print is organized, including directionality and, for English orthog\u00adraphy, the left-to-right and top-to\u00adbottom organization of print in books or other print media (Clay 2002). Print conventions also refer to the way books are organized (e.g., front and back) and the way they should be handled (Clay 2002). The second aspect of this substrand focuses on childr en's understanding that print can be read and has spe\u00adcific meaning. Children are beginning to understand and operate within the routines and contexts in which print is a component, and they are learn\u00ading that reading and writing play a key role in various social contexts. By interacting with and observing adults using print, preschool children learn the vocabulary of r eading in instruc\u00ad tional contexts\u2014such as read, write, draw, page, and story (Morgan cited in Weir 1989; van Kleeck 1990)\u2014as well as the routines that govern literacy use in the classroom, home, or preschool setting, for example, reading stories, making lists, and writing letters (Elster 1988; Elster and Walker 1992). Although natural exposure to print has a positive influence on childr en's awareness of concepts about print, researchers have found that adults need to deliberately and actively encourage children's engagement with print by explicitly drawing children's attention to print forms and functions (Justice and others 2005). Strategies teachers use to help young children develop print awareness skills include asking questions about print, com\u00admenting about print, tracking print when reading, and pointing to print (Justice and Ezell 2000, 2002). Phonological Awareness. \"Phono\u00ad logical awar eness\" is generally defined as an individual's sensitivity to the sound (or phonological) structure of spoken language independent of mean\u00ading. Spoken language is made up of different phonological units that differ in their linguistic complexity. The pho\u00adnological units include words, sylla\u00adbles, subsyllabic units (onsets, rimes), sounds (phonemes). Phonological sensitivity\") should be differentiated from \"phonemic aware\u00adness.\" Phonemic awareness is the most advanced level of phonological aware\u00adness that an individual can achieve. It refers to one's ability to recognize and manipulate phonemes, which con\u00adstitute the smallest units of spoken words. Phonological awareness (and LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 80 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY phonemic awareness) should also be distinguished from phonics. \"Phonics\" is a method of instruction that focuses on teaching the relationships between sounds and the letters that represent them, whereas phonological awareness is an oral language skill that does not involve print. The development of phonological awareness typically moves along a continuum in which children prog\u00adress from a sensitivity to larger con\u00adcrete units of sound to a sensitivity to smaller abstract units of sound (Adams 1990; Anthony and others 2002; Fox and Bryant, and Bradley 1987; Treiman 1992). Typi\u00adcally, children's first achievements in phonological awareness are to detect and manipulate words and syllables within words and to then progress to awareness of onsets and rimes. The onset of a syllable is the first conso\u00adnant or consonant cluster (e.g., the m-in the word map, the dr-in the word drum), whereas the rime of a syllable is its vowel and any ending consonants (e.g., -ap in the word map, -um in the word drum). Finally, children develop awareness of the smallest abstract units of sound, the phonemes. Pho\u00adnemes can be represented by single letters, such as with the phonemes c\u2014a\u2014t in the word cat, or with two letters, such as in the ch- in the word cheese; but not all letters in a word represent a phoneme, such as the silent-e in the word store. The founda\u00adtions reflect these gradations in the achievement of phonological awareness as children become gradually more sensitive to smaller units of spoken language. In addition to development involv\u00ad ing the linguistic complexity of sound units, childr en demonstrate their pho\u00ad nological awareness through three types of operations\u2014detection, syn\u00adthesis, and analysis (Anthony, Loni\u00adgan, and Burgess 2003). \"Detection\" is the ability to match similar sounds. \"Synthesis\" is the ability to combine smaller segments into syllables and words. \"Analysis\" is the ability to seg\u00adment words or syllables into smaller units. At the level of segmenting words into syllables and segmenting syllables into onset and rime, children's phono\u00adlogical awareness performance usually progresses from detection, to syn\u00adthesis, to analysis. This development does not occur in discrete stages but instead represents overlapping abilities (Anthony, Lonigan, and Burgess 2003). That is, children do not have to com\u00adpletely master the earlier skill before they begin to acquire the next skill in the sequence. The foundations concur\u00adrently address the developmental levels of phonological awareness within the various performance areas, so that a progression can be seen from the ability to detect and blend words to the ability to segment at the onset-rime level. The position of a phoneme in a word or syllable and the context in which the phoneme occurs also influence the level of difficulty of a phonologi\u00adcal awar eness task. Children are able to detect or manipulate the initial phonemes in words before they can detect or manipulate final phonemes. Additionally, children have more dif\u00adficulty in identifying or manipulating a phoneme that is a part of a cluster Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 81 than they do phonemes that are not in a cluster. For instance, children may be able to identify the three phonemes in pop but have difficulty in identifying the four phonemes in plop because the onset of the word contains a conso\u00adnant cluster. The foundations address these variations in the level of difficulty of phonological awareness tasks by focusing the harder operations (e.g., deleting parts of words and blending phonemes) on the initial parts of words (deleting onsets rather than deleting rimes) and on simple words (blending of words that have a limited number of phonemes and do not contain clusters). One additional source of variation relates to the amount and kind of sup\u00adports provided to children so that they can perform these tasks. For example, when asking children to delete the onset of a word, the teacher can pro\u00advide pictures of stimuli to reduce the level of difficulty of the task. This approach helps children to remember the different words and enhances their performance compared with having them perform this task without picture stimuli. When needed, the founda\u00adtions emphasize phonological aware\u00adness performance within the context of support, and the expectation is that children will demonstrate mastery in the context of the support provided by pictures, props, objects, or other valid supportive context. This is the case for the foundations that involve the manipulation of smaller units of sound within more difficult forms of cognitive operations (e.g., deletion of a word's initial phoneme). Phonological awareness is an impor\u00ad tant ar ea of early and later reading instruction (Bowers 1995; Bowers and Wolf 1993; Lonigan, Burgess, and Anthony 2000; Report of the National Reading Panel: T eaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and Its Implications for Reading Instruction 2000; Prather, Hendrick, 1994; Wagner and others 1997). Pho\u00adnological awareness plays a key role in several of the components that help children become skilled readers, such as understanding the alphabetic prin\u00adciple (Burgess and Lonigan 1998; Ehri 1991, 1995), (Beck and Byrne ; Tunmer, Herriman, Nesdale 1988), spelling (Bryant and others 1990; Gentry 1982; Read 1975), and reading comprehension\u2014although this relation with reading comprehension is not direct (Tunmer and Nesdale 1985). Given the importance of phono\u00ad logical awar eness to early and later literacy achievement, these founda\u00adtions emphasize attention to its devel\u00adopment for older preschool children. They do not include, however, specific indicators for younger children, as is explained next. First, evidence sug\u00adgests that phonological awareness is not consistently mastered by chil\u00addren under four years of age (Loni\u00adgan, Burgess, and Anthony 2000), although performance at three years of age can be assessed and targeted through instruction. Second, vocabu\u00adlary is highly related to children's acquisition of phonological sensitivity Lonigan and others 1998; Loni\u00adgan, Burgess, and Anthony 2000). Most probably, the positive effect of vocabulary on phonological awareness LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY 82 is based on the fact that vocabulary development facilitates children's abil\u00adity to focus their attention on parts of words, rather than on their whole, as children learn more words (see Met\u00adsala and Walley 1998), thus helping them progress in their phonological awareness from large to smaller units of sound. From these findings, Loni\u00adgan and others (Fowler 1991; Jusczyk Walley 1993) conclude that vocabulary devel\u00adopment may provide the basis for the emergence of phonological awareness. Therefore, the foundations focus on this key precursor for three-year-olds and include phonological awareness foundations for children at around 60 months of age, because mastery of phonological awareness is more appro\u00adpriate for older preschool children. Alphabetics and Word/Print Recognition. The ability to recognize letters is a basic step in the process of learning to read and write. Knowledge of the alphabet letters is a strong pre\u00addictor of short- and long-term reading success. Children who have a well-developed knowledge of the letters before engaging in reading instruction make better progress than those who do not (Adams 1990; Badian 1982; Bond and 1996; Share and Tunmer, Herriman, and Nesdale 1988; Walsh, Price, and Gill\u00adingham, 1988). Knowing the names of letters facilitates children's ability to decode text and to apply the alphabetic principle to word recognition. For most children the name of the letters helps them connect the sounds in words and letters in print (Durrell 1980). Know\u00adledge of letter names, then, can be conceived as a mediator in the reading process that provides children with the ability to remember the sounds associ\u00adated with letters (Ehri 1979, 1998). The order of learning the alphabet letters seems facilitated by environ\u00admental and developmental influences. An important environmental influence is exposure to the individual letters of the alphabet. Children learn first the letters that are the most familiar to them, such as the letters in their own names and the letters that occur earlier in the alphabet string (Treiman and Broderick 1998). The features of certain letters make them more ame\u00adnable to learning. For instance, letters that contain their sound in a child's name, like b and f, are learned ear\u00adlier than are those letters that do not, like q and w (Treiman and Broderick 1998). A developmental influence on children's learning of alphabet letters relates to the relationship between phonological development and alpha\u00adbet knowledge. Children learn earlier those letters that map onto earlier-acquired phonemes, such as the \"b\" letter sound and the \"d\" letter sound, instead of letters that map onto pho\u00adnemes that tend to be acquired later, such as the \"r\" letter sound and the \"l\" letter sound. (Justice and others 2006). Consequently, the focus of the foundations is on children's ability to recognize or identify familiar letters and words, such as the first letter of their name and, later, their whole first name. As children become aware of the names of letters, they also begin to identify printed wor ds. Ehri (1995) has defined children's development in word recognition as a series of transitions as children move from \"prealphabetic Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 83 readers\" (learning words by sight and using salient contextual cues for word recognition), to \"partial alphabetic\" (applying some phonetic information, such as the sound corresponding to the first letter in a word, to recognizing the word), to \"full alphabetic\" (read\u00ading a word using the alphabetic prin\u00adciple). The word recognition skills of preschool-age children are primarily of a prealphabetic type, so that they can recognize some words, but rarely can they examine the alphabetic or pho\u00adnetic structures of the word to arrive at its meaning. This is why young children are able to recognize some words in the environment (e.g., Stop, Exit, and some brand names), but they require contextual information from the environment to aid their recogni\u00adtion of these words. Some children who have well-developed knowledge of the alphabet and letter-sound cor\u00adrespondences, coupled with relatively good phonological awareness, may read at partial alphabetic levels dur\u00ading the preschool years. These children are able to look at some unknown words and use letters (and their corre\u00adsponding sounds) to unlock the word's meaning. For instance, a child may see the word Thomas in a book and use some alphabetic information (e.g., the first letter T and its corresponding let\u00adter sound) to make a good guess as to what it says. Comprehension and Analysis of Age-Appropriate Text. Reading com\u00ad prehension is influenced greatly by language comprehension, and in large part they draw on the same develop\u00admental processes (Perfetti, Van Dyke, and Hart 2001). Just as children move from understanding simple phrases and directions to comprehending more detailed information, they also progress from remembering isolated aspects of simple stories to under \u00ad standing parts of more complex literacy events. As children become better able to respond to complex literacy events that feature causal or temporal sequences or descriptions of nonfiction, real events, they draw on their narrative skills in particular. \"Narrative\" is a term that describes production and comprehension of discourse (including both written and spoken). A defining feature of narrative is its organizational cohesion, so that information is threaded over a series of utterances or sentences. Preschool children's development of narrative thinking goes thr ough a series of stages that ultimately help them to make sense of stories and the world around them (Paris and Paris 2003). At the early stages preschool children construct narrative scripts, which involve primitive accounts of story plots. These scripts usually focus on the description of familiar events and routine activities, such as going to a birthday party or visiting the doctor. Over time, children construct narra\u00adtive schemas, which include knowledge about the main elements of stories (such as characters and settings) and about the sequence of events (such as time, order, and causal progression). In the last, and perhaps most dif\u00adficult stage, preschool children come to understand and relate to charac\u00adters' internal responses, such as their mental processes and experiences. This ability to understand characters' internal thinking also helps children to develop a sense of perspective by which they can empathize with the experiences and reactions of charac\u00adters in a story, and it helps children develop the ability to recognize both LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 84 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY the external and internal features of narratives. Children's comprehension and pro\u00ad duction of narrative is an important foundation for learning to read (Burns, Griffin, and Snow 1999; Whitehurst and Lonigan 1998). Narratives are pervasive in children's language, play, and thinking and tend to be naturally supported by parents and teachers. However, narrative competence can be expanded through designed interven\u00adtions (Yussen and Ozcan 1996). Exposure to wordless picture books pr ovides both instructional opportuni\u00ad ties for children and a window into the process for teachers. When reading wordless picture books and books with print, preschool children use a com\u00admon set of strategies to grasp meaning: they make use of prior knowledge and experiences, pay attention to intertex\u00adtual cues and multiple perspectives, rely on story language and rituals, and implement active, playful behavior as a part of the reading process (Crawford and Hade 2000). Children's efforts to make sense of the pictures in word\u00adless picture books form the foundation for the reading comprehension and meaning-making skills needed later to be successful readers (Paris and van Kraayenoord 1998). Children's narra\u00adtive comprehension of wordless picture books has been shown to be an effec\u00adtive way to assess children's compre\u00adhension when they are still not able to decode (Paris and Paris 2003). Storybook reading, both of wordless pictur e books and books with print, when combined with interactive lan\u00adguage activities, has other benefits as well. Active discussion of stories before, during, and after shared read\u00ading has been shown to improve chil\u00addren's understanding and recall of oral stories (Cochran-Smith 1984; Mason and Allen 1986; Morr ow 1984; Mor\u00ad row and Smith 1990). Book reading also contributes to general language development, whether it is practiced at home (Chomsky 1972; Raz and Bryant 1990; S\u00e9n\u00e9chal and others 1998; Wells 1985a; Whitehurst and others 1988) or in the classroom (Dickinson Hao, and Teale 1993; Teale and Martinez 1986). Within the classroom, studies conducted with preschool children have shown that intervention-enhanced teacher-child interactions have positive effects on the children's language skills (e.g., syntactic forms at the sentence level) (Arnold and Whitehurst 1994; Karweit 1989; Valdez-Menchaca and Whitehu\u00adrst 1992). This enhanced development of language abilities may in turn lead to enhanced comprehension (Elley and Mangubhai 1983; Feitelson, Kita, and Goldstein 1986; Feitelson and others 1993; Morrow 1984, 1988). Shared reading activities provide an adult with the opportunity to intr oduce key components of the reading task to children and to support their learning of these key issues. Research has shown that such practices as shared reading, when conducted over time, provide children with a sense of the purposes of literacy (Gee 1992; Heath 1983), the values associated with shared reading (Snow and others 1991), and the processes and skills involved in shared reading (see the preceding paragraph). While storybook reading has often been considered an introduction to literacy (Adams 1990), the practices and styles of interaction that emerge during shared reading set the foundation for the Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 85 types of cognitive processing and problem solving that characterize comprehension in the elementary grades, with strategies such as self-questioning and use of mental imagery (Bauman and Bergeron 1993; Fitzgerald and Spiegel 1983). Shared reading activities also help children become familiar with the nature of written language and help preschool children realize the developmental progression from an \"oral\" to a \"written\" type of language (Purcell-Gates 1988; Sulzby 1985). Children entering school from dis\u00ad advantaged environments often have limited or minimal exposure to com\u00adplex narrative texts. Shared reading, picture-book reading, and the instruc\u00adtional conversations are of special relevance for these children. The lack of exposure puts them at a disadvan\u00adtage when they are placed in class\u00adrooms with students who have been repeatedly exposed to the language, ideas, routines, and pleasures associ\u00adated with complex text (Baker, Serpell, and Sonnenschein 1995; Dahl and Freppon 1991; Marvin and 1993; Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children 1998; Purcell-Gates and Dahl 1991). Fortunately, this exposure gap can be closed through instruction at home and in school (Clay 1979; Lepp\u00e4en and others 2004; Purcell-Gates, McIntyre, and Frep\u00adpon 1995). For example, adults can explicitly engage children with think\u00ading about and responding to specific elements of texts during storybook reading interactions. They might, for instance, focus a child's atten\u00adtion on following the cause-and-effect sequence of a story or discussing words that occur repeatedly in a text to create coherence. It is most impor\u00adtant that adults who read with young children provide this structure consistently and systematically, so that they support children's engage\u00adment with certain aspects of the text (e.g., causal flow of events) that chil\u00addren may not be drawn to incidentally or of their own accord (Ezell and Justice 2000). Literacy Interest and Response. The comprehension of text for young children requires both skill and will, will usually being a precursor to skill. Showing an interest in books and holding a positive regard for read\u00ading are considered developmental accomplishments of three- and four\u00adyear-olds by the National Research Council (Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children 1998). Children's willing participation in such literacy activities as handling books and listen\u00ading to stories is an essential precur\u00adsor to their later cognitive engagement with text, in the same way that early joint attention between a caregiver and a child is an essential precursor to achievements in oral language produc\u00adtion and comprehension. Early interest in literacy may also motivate children to persist with future challenging read\u00ading tasks (Preventing Reading Difficul\u00adties in Young Children 1998). Cognitive skills are necessary for children to become able readers, but to become lifelong literacy learners, children must be motivated to engage in literacy activities and persist in their engage\u00adment. As such, interest in literacy is closely linked to the issue of motiva\u00adtion. Interest in and motivation toward reading describe the child's affect toward, or feelings about, literacy activities (Alexander and Filler 1976; Mathewson 1994; McKenna, Kear, LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 86 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY and Ellsworth 1995). The beliefs, moti\u00ad vation, and purposes of individuals influence their decisions about which activities to do, how long to do them, and how much effort to put into them (Bandura 1997; Eccles, Wigfield, and Schiefele 1998; Pintrich and Schunk literature on motivation makes a distinction between \"intrin\u00adsic motivation,\" which refers to being motivated to do an activity for its own sake and out of interest and curiosity, and \"extrinsic motivation,\" or doing an activity to receive an award or other form of recognition (Guthrie, Wigfield, and Von Secker 2000). Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation influence the amount and frequency of children's reading. However, research has shown that intrinsic motivation is a stronger predictor of reading achievement than is extrinsic motivation (Baker and Wigfield 1997). Motivation toward reading influences individuals' engagement with reading and literacy activities by facilitating their entry into a \"psycho\u00adlogical state of interest\" (Krapp, Hidi, and Renniger 1992), in which individu\u00adals demonstrate increased attention, cognitive functioning, and persistence in different literacy tasks, as well as an increase in their affective investment (Hidi, 1990; Krapp, Hidi, and Renniger 1992). Reading in this state of interest facilitates comprehension and recall of information (see Anderson 1982; Asher 1979, 1980; Bernstein 1955; Estes interest and motiva\u00ad tion toward reading and literacy have most extensively been conducted with school-age children and college students. Nonetheless, an emer ging research base shows that interest and motivation are also factors in pre\u00adschool reading achievement (Scarbor\u00adough and Dobrich 1994; Whitehurst and Lonigan 1998). Research with young children has confirmed that they have strong, stable, and relatively well-focused individual interests that influence their attention, recognition, and recall of information during lit\u00aderacy activities, such as shared story\u00adbook reading (Renninger and Wozniak 1985). In addition, children's active engagement in text-related activities, such as turning pages in a book, is related to knowledge of print concepts at four years of age (Crain-Thoresen and Dale 1992). Preschool children who are engaged and attentive during literacy activities achieve greater lit\u00aderacy gains in these activities (Justice and others 2003). A positive relationship exists between childr en's interest in reading and their opportunities for reading at home and school. Children who are read to more frequently and from an earlier age tend to have a greater inter\u00adest in literacy, exhibit superior literacy skills during the preschool and school years, choose reading more frequently, initiate reading sessions on their own, and show greater engagement during reading sessions (Lonigan 1994; Scar\u00adborough and Dobrich 1994). Guthrie and others (1996) have also reported that increasing literacy engagement and expanded reading activity are tied to increases in intrinsic motivation, whereas decreased literacy engage\u00adment is reflected in decreased intrin\u00adsic motivation. In short, adult-child storybook reading promotes children's interest in and motivation for reading, Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education both of which lead to increased expo\u00ad sure, experience, and engagement with text. This engagement with text has a positive effect on overall reading abil\u00adity (Bus 2001; Whitehurst and Lonigan 1998). The opposite is also true: nega\u00adtive attitudes toward reading, espe\u00adcially recreational reading, usually lead to decreased exposure to reading and reading ability (McKenna, Kear, and Ellsworth 1995). In addition to increasing children's exposure to reading and print and their interest in literacy, early read\u00ading activities also help children learn about the context of literacy and the structure of literacy activities (Crain-Thoreson and Dale 1992), providing children with the language used at school for literacy activities (Heath 1982; Wells 1985b). Helping children become familiar with some aspects of the language (Heath 1982), participant structures (Phillips 1983), and pat\u00adterns of interaction (Cazden 1986) of the classroom during the preschool years will place them in the right tra\u00adjectory to be successful learners in school (Improving Schooling for Lan\u00adguage-Minority Children: A Research Agenda 1997). Consequently, the foun\u00addations focus on children's engage\u00adment in literacy activities in a way that will furnish them with knowledge about the roles and routines of reading and literacy activities they are likely to experience when they enter school. Writing Writing Strategies. Learning to write involves cognitive, social, and physical development. From a very young age, children notice the writing in their surroundings. They begin to develop the understanding that regular 87 signs can be used to represent ideas or concepts. At first, they may conclude that there should be some resem\u00adblance between what is being repre\u00adsented and the way it is represented. For example, they may say that train must be a very long word, while mosquito must be a very small one (Ferreiro and Teberosky 1982; Piaget 1962). At the same time, they begin to differentiate between writing and other kinds of visual representation (e.g., drawing) (Bissex 1980; Ferreiro and Teberosky 1982; Harste, Woodward, and Burke 1984). They accompany this realization with a differentiation between the tools for writing and those for drawing (\"I need to get a pencil to write my name\"). Moreover, their writ\u00ading starts to look different from their drawing (Ferreiro and Teberosky 1982; Harste, Woodward, and Burke 1984), often being linear in form instead of circular. As young children get more involved with written text by being read to, examining books, and observing others write, they begin to experiment with writing. Children's emergent writing abilities are demonstrated in the preschool classroom with such activities as pretending to write and learning to write one's name (White\u00adhurst and Lonigan 2001). According to some theorists, children's writing follows a developmental path. Initially, children demonstrate a global form of writing. They tend to treat writing from a pictographic perspective, which is usually demonstrated by using draw\u00adings as writing or using idiosyncratic scribble (e.g., markings that have meaning only for the child). Later, children use letter-like forms to write, usually making marks that resemble LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY 88 characteristics of the real writing (e.g., longer words are represented by longer strings of letter-like symbols). In the next stage children start using actual letters to write, even when there is no connection between the true spelling of what they want to write and what they produce (i.e., producing nonpho\u00adnetic strings of letters) (Ferreiro and Teberosky 1982; Sulzby 1986, 1987). This stage is followed by a period when children produce phonetic spell\u00ading, also called \"invented spelling.\" Children use letter-like symbols to represent the parts of words that they hear and attempt to match letters to sounds or syllables, usually based on sound rather than on what is written (Ferreiro and Teberosky 1982). For example, children may recognize that to write something requires more than one or two symbols, and they may also realize that the same symbols may recur in different words and in differ\u00adent places in the word (Ferreiro and Teberosky 1982; Temple and others 1993), but they have not yet mastered the alphabetic principle. Nonethe\u00adless, several studies have shown that invented spelling is an effective vehicle through which many children begin to understand the alphabetic principle (Clarke 1988; Ehri 1988; Torgesen and Davis 1996). Throughout this early stage of lear ning to write, children begin to realize that writing carries meaning; people should be able to read what you write (Clay 1977; Harste, Wood\u00adward, and Burke 1984; Kress 1994). They also learn that people write for different purposes (Ferreiro and Teberosky Teale 1987). While research shows that children from different cultural and socioeco\u00adnomic backgrounds have different experiences with written language, it also shows that all children have experienced written language and its purposes (McGee and Richgels 1990). Finally, children have the physi\u00ad cal experience of actually writing and drawing, in which they begin to develop ef fective (or not so effective) ways of handling writing implements. While many children handle writing implements efficiently, some children need support in learning to do so. Children who are still using scribbles and have difficulty with the basic shapes (circle, square, triangle) would benefit from informal instruction in learning to make these shapes, since they ease the transition to learning letters (Lesiak 1997).

LANGUAGE AND LITERACY California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 FOUNDATIONS IN English-Language Development California is experiencing a dra\u00ad matic increase in the number of children from birth to five years of age whose home language is not English. Currently, one in four California students\u201425 percent\u2014in kindergarten through grade twelve are identified as English learners (Califor\u00ad nia Department of Education [CDE] 2006a, b). The term \"English learners\" refers to children whose first language is not English and encompasses chil\u00addren learning English for the first time in the preschool setting as well as chil\u00ad dren who have developed various levels of English proficiency (Rivera and Col\u00adlum 2006). For the majority of these children, Spanish is the home lan\u00adguage, followed by Vietnamese, Can\u00adtonese, Hmong, Tagalog, Korean, and other languages (CDE 2006a). Whereas 25 percent of California children in kindergarten through grade twelve are identified as English learners, English learners represent 39 percent of chil\u00addren in California between three and five years of age (Children Now 2007). Given this reality, the development of preschool learning foundations must take into consideration how young children whose home language is not English negotiate learning in all content and curricular areas. For all childr en, the home language is the vehicle by which they are socialized into their families and communities. Children's identity and sense of self are inextricably linked to the language they speak and the culture in which they have been socialized, which takes place in a specific family context (Cra-go 1988; Johnston and Wong 2002; Ochs and Schieffelin 1995; Vasquez, Pease-Alvarez, and Shannon 1994). In addition, in most families, children are first introduced to language and literacy in the home language, and those experiences provide an impor\u00adtant foundation for success in learning literacy in English \u00f6ney Snow 1989; Lopez and Greenfield 2004). Researchers have documented the fragility of a child's home language and cultural practices when they do not r epresent the mainstream or are not highly valued. Genesee, Paradis, and Crago (2004) caution that, \"dual-lan\u00adguage children are particularly at risk for both cultural and linguistic identity displacement.\" Loss of the home lan\u00adguage may diminish parent-child communication, reducing a parent's California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 103 104 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT ability to transmit familial values, beliefs, and understandings (Wong Fillmore 1991b), all of which form an important part of a young child's so\u00adcialization and identity. Regardless of which language or languages young children are exposed to at home, they have, at best, only partially mastered the language when they enter the pre\u00adschool setting (Bialystok 2001). The ex\u00adtent to which a child's home language and home culture can be included in the preschool classroom as a resource impacts a child's sense of self-efficacy and social and cognitive development (Chang and others and Purcell-Gates 2003; Moll 1992; Riojas-Cortez 2001; of language and lit\u00ad eracy skills in a child's first language is important for the development of skills in a second language and, therefore, should be considered the first step in the range of expectations for children learning English as a second language (International Reading Association and National Association for the Education of Young Children 1998). Learning by these children is not confined to one language. Children who have the skills to understand and communicate in their home language will transfer that knowledge to their learning of a second language, resulting in a more effective and efficient second-language learn\u00ading process (Cummins 1979; Wong Fillmore 1991a). For example, building Spanish-speaking children's language skills in their first language directly enhances their literacy development in English (Bialystok 2001; Child\u00adhood Bilingualism 2006; Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children 1998). The transfer of knowledge ap\u00adplies to the structure of language and early literacy skills, such as concepts about print, phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, and writing in alphabetic script 2001; Mumtaz and Humphreys 2001). Recent research suggests that the development of two languages ben\u00adefits the brain through the increase in density of brain tissue in areas related to language, memory, and attention (Mechelli and others 2004). Although the brain structures of bilingual chil\u00addren and monolingual children are similar and process language in basi\u00adcally the same way, bilingual children have higher rates of engagement in particular parts of the brain (Kovel\u00adman, Baker, and Petitto 2006). This increased brain activity may have long-term positive effects (Bialystok, Craik, and Ryan 2006). In addition, it is im\u00adportant to acknowledge the heteroge\u00adneity of the English learner population and, in particular, the parameters of variation within the population, such as the age of the child and the amount of exposure to the home language and English; the relative dominance of each language; and the similarities and dif\u00adferences between the two languages. These same parameters systematically affect the language and literacy devel\u00adopment of English learners (Childhood Bilingualism 2006). The preschool learning foundations in English-language development are foundations in language and literacy for preschool children whose home language is not English. These founda\u00adtions for English learners are intended for use with children who arrive at preschool functioning predominantly Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education in their home language, not English, and set the stage for further English-language acquisition described within the foundations. These foundations are organized to align with the content categories of California's English-lan\u00adguage development standards, which cover kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) and are divided into the following three categories: (1) listening and speaking; (2) reading; and (3) writ\u00ading. As with the K-12 standards, the preschool learning foundations in English-language development are designed to assist classroom teachers in their understanding of children's progress toward English-language pro\u00adficiency. They are meant to be used along with the language and literacy foundations, not in place of them. The foundations can be demonstrated in a variety of settings, and children will often demonstrate their language abili\u00adties when engaged in authentic, natu\u00adral, child-initiated activities. Stages of Sequential Bilingual Language Development Children entering a preschool pro\u00ad gram with little or no knowledge of English typically move through several stages on their journey to achieving success in the second language (Ta\u00adbors 1997). Both the length of time the child remains at a stage and the level of expectation for second-language learning depend on several impor\u00adtant characteristics of the child and the child's language environment. For example, the age of a child may help determine the child's developmental level, while the child's temperament may influence her motivation to learn a new language (Genesee, Paradis, and Crago 2004; Genishi, Yung-Chan, and 105 Stires 2000). The first stage for young English learners occurs when they attempt to use their home language to communicate with teachers and peers (Saville-Troike 1987; Tabors 1997). During this stage, children gradually realize they are not being understood and must adapt to their new language environment. Over time\u2014for some children, a mat\u00ad ter of days; for some, months\u2014a shift occurs, and the child begins to actively attend to the new language, observing and silently processing the features of the English language. This is con\u00adsidered the second stage (Ervin-Tripp 1974; Hakuta 1987, Itoh and Hatch 1978; Tabors 1997). This observational period is normal in second-language learners. The children are not shut\u00adting down; rather, they are attending to the language interactions occurring around them. Typically, the child will attempt to communicate nonverbally, using gestures, facial expressions, and often some vocalizations, such as crying or laughing. The third stage occurs when the child is r eady to \"go public\" with the new language. The child typically masters the rhythm and the intona\u00adtion of the second language as well as some key phrases, using telegraphic and formulaic speech to communicate (Tabors 1997; Wong Fillmore 1976). \"Telegraphic speech\" refers to the use of a few content words without func\u00adtional words or specific grammatical markers. For example, a child might use one word combined with nonver\u00adbal communication, intonation, facial expressions, and so forth to commu\u00adnicate different ideas. So a child say\u00ading, \"Up!\" while pointing at a plane in the sky might mean, \"Look, there's a plane!\" or a child saying, \"Up?\" while California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 106 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT pointing to or otherwise indicating a toy on a shelf might mean, \"Can you get me that toy? I can't reach it.\" Formulaic speech is a related strategy that refers to children's use of memo\u00adrized chunks or phrases of language without completely understanding the function of those phrases. Sometimes children add new vocabulary as well. For example, \"I want ________,\" is a formula that allows for a host of possi\u00adbilities: \"I want play.\" \"I want doll.\" \"I want go.\" Children use such formu\u00adlas as a strategy to expand their communication. In the fourth stage the child is in\u00ad troduced to new vocabulary words and moves into the productive language stage, at which she is able to express herself by using her own words (Ta\u00adbors 1997). The child demonstrates a general understanding of the rules of English and is able to apply them more accurately to achieve increasing con\u00adtrol over the language. However, this does not mean that the child commu\u00adnicates as does a native speaker of the language. The child may mispronounce words as well as make errors in vocab\u00adulary choice and grammar. Such errors are indicative of the typical process of learning a language (Genesee, Paradis, and Crago 2004). Movement through the four stages may take anywher e from six months to two years, depending on the child and the quality of that child's language environment. The stages of second-language development should be con\u00adsidered when determining expectations for individual children during their preschool years. It should be noted that full fluency (e.g., compr ehension, expression, reading, and writing) in any language takes anywhere from four to ten years (Bialystok 2001; Hakuta, Butler, and W itt 2000). In addition, the speed of acquisition is influenced by a broad range of factors (Snow 2006). There\u00adfore, for three- and four-year-old children, it is important to provide a continuum that moves them toward a reasonable, and desirable, set of lan\u00adguage and literacy expectations that can be achieved over the span of the one to two years that a child spends in the preschool classroom. English learners will vary substan\u00ad tially in their acquisition of language competencies, depending on a num\u00adber of backgr ound factors (i.e., the degree of exposure to English outside the classroom, the individual child's motivation to acquire English, and so forth). Because of the wide range of language capability found in children prior to their entering school (Ehrman, Leaver, and Oxford 2003), the use of developmental markers, such as \"beginning,\" \"middle,\" and \"later,\" are used to provide for a range of expecta\u00adtions for performance. These mark\u00aders are used in the preschool learning foundations for English-language development to designate a develop\u00admental progression for children who have made significant progress toward acquisition of the home language before beginning to acquire English (sequential bilingualism) (Genesee, Paradis, and Crago 2004). The use of these terms should not be confused with the ter ms \"early,\" \"middle,\" and \"later,\" as used in the resource guide Preschool English Learners: Principles and Practices to Promote Language, Literacy, and Learn\u00ading (2007) to describe typical phases of language development for children who are monolingual speakers and children who acquire two languages from birth Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 107 or sometime during the first year of life (simultaneous bilingualism). Structure of This Domain: A Developmental Progression The continuum of \"beginning,\" \"middle,\" and \"later\" levels provides a framework for understanding chil\u00addren's second-language development in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The first and second stages of sequential bilingual language develop\u00adment are combined in the \"beginning\" level in this domain. Young English learners may demonstrate uneven development across these foundations and may show higher levels of mastery in certain areas than in others. For example, while children may be able to understand certain words in the read\u00ading and writing areas, their productive control over grammar, pronunciation, and articulation in speaking may de\u00advelop last. Related to this developmen\u00adtal variability across particular founda\u00adtion domains is the rate of progression through the continuum of \"beginning,\" \"middle,\" and \"later.\" Progression through the continuum is highly con\u00adtingent on the quantity and quality of language experience in both the home and the classroom. Research on the quality of preschool environments has found that learning is influenced by a number of important classroom fac\u00adtors (Pianta and others 2005). Chief among them are the amount and type of verbal input provided by teachers of young children (Peisner-Feinberg and others 2001). Wong Fillmore and Snow (2000) point out that children need di\u00adrect and frequent interaction with indi\u00adviduals who know the second language very well and can provide the English learner accurate feedback. Beginning Level This is when typically developing childr en will have acquired age- appropriate language skills in their home language and, once introduced to English, will begin to develop recep\u00adtive English abilities. Children at this level are actively processing the fea\u00adtures of the English language, includ\u00ading vocabulary, grammar, phonology, and pragmatics. Most children speak little during this stage. They may be able to listen, point, match, move, draw, copy, mime, act out, choose, respond with gestures, and follow pre\u00addictable routines. They will begin to develop an understanding of English based on their home language. Fre\u00adquently, children will spontaneously use their home language even when not understood. Middle Level Expressive language marks the mid\u00ad dle level of early speech pr oduction in English. Children may repeat familiar phrases that have been functionally effective, such as \"lookit\" or \"Iwant\" throughout the day. It is expected that vocabulary use increases and that children will begin to combine words and phrases in English. Comprehen\u00adsion will continue to develop, and children will likely use telegraphic and formulaic speech in English. At the same time, they may continue to use their home language and may insert words from their home language into English-language utterances; this is known as code-switching and is a nor\u00admal part of second-language acquisi\u00adtion. This period is analogous to the third stage of sequential bilingualism. California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 108 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT Later Level Children at the later level in the continuum will have much stronger comprehension skills. Children will begin to use English to learn differ\u00adent concepts across the curriculum. Their use of age-appropriate English grammar improves. They use their first and second languages to acquire new knowledge at home and at school. Al\u00adthough children are improving during this period, it should not be assumed that they have complete age-appropri\u00adate mastery of English; they are, how\u00adever, able to engage in a majority of classroom activities in English. Errors in English usage are common at this point because children are continuing to experiment with the new language and are still learning its rules and structure. Categories of English-Language Development The preschool learning foundations in English-language development de\u00ad scribe a typical developmental progres\u00adsion for preschool English learners in four general categories: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. These foundations illustrate a developmental progression for children who come to preschool knowing very little, if any, English. As children move through this progression, they are developing the underlying linguistic knowledge needed to learn from a curriculum that is taught in a language they are just learning, English. As such, these foundations\u2014especially the examples following each foundation\u2014are intend\u00aded to provide guidance to adults who are working to help preschool Eng\u00adlish learners gain the knowledge and skills necessary in all domains of the California preschool learning founda\u00ad tions. The foundations are not meant to be assessment items or a checklist of behavioral indicators of the knowl\u00adedge and skills that must be observed before a teacher can decide that the competency is present. Children are different from one another and will vary in the extent to which they dem\u00adonstrate the behaviors described in the examples. Listening Children's language development is based on active listening. For example, children's receptive control precedes their productive control of language. That is, they understand more than they can produce at the onset of lan\u00adguage learning in both their home language (or languages) and English. When children understand, they exhibit gestures, behaviors, and non\u00adverbal responses that indicate they understand what they have heard. Listening and understanding in English will depend on children's re\u00adceptive comprehension in their home language. In other words, children's listening strategies in their home lan\u00adguage will be applied to their strategies for learning English (Bialystok 2001). Overall, the development of early lit\u00aderacy foundations is built on the devel\u00adopment of active listening, the social uses of language, and nonverbal communication (Scott-Little, Kagan, and Frelow 2005). Speaking Within the classroom environment, daily routines and classroom rituals, such as organized circle time or peer\u00adto-peer interaction on the playground, provide opportunities for English learners to use oral language in both Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education the home language and English (Geni\u00ad shi, Stires, and Yung-Chan 2001). Initially, children may use telegraphic and formulaic speech in English along with gestures, nonverbal behavior, and turn-taking. Then, the use of nonverbal communication, in com\u00adbination with elaborated verbal com\u00admunication, will mark their progress in learning a second language. When speaking, children may code-switch; that is, combine English with their home language to make themselves understood. In fact, the vast major\u00adity of instances of code-switching are systematic and follow the grammatical rules of the two languages (Allen and others Asking questions, responding to complex grammatical patter ns, and making commentaries are indicators of later development. The creative use of language and creative expression through narrative also indicate a grow\u00ading sophistication of formal language use. Research has found that narrative skills developed in the first language transfer to the second language (Miller and others 2006; Pearson 2002; Uccelli and Paez 2007). Young Eng\u00adlish learners can distinguish between their home language and the language used in the classroom, and this may be demonstrated by the children's use of either the home language or Eng\u00adlish when responding to their peers and teachers. It should be noted that the development of grammatical se\u00adquences varies among the different language populations, and this may influence their development of gram\u00admar in English (Childhood Bilingualism 2006; Huang and Hatch 1978; Yoshida 109 1978). For example, in Chinese there are no words that end with \"-ing\" as compared to English. In Spanish, the descriptive adjective is placed after the noun, whereas in English the adjective is placed before the noun. Furthermore, the development of oral language skills in a second language is closely tied to vocabulary expan\u00adsion (Saunders and O'Brien 2006). In turn, English vocabulary development plays an important role in support\u00ading later English literacy development (August and others 2005). The produc\u00adtive vocabulary of English learners is typically composed of nouns; as time passes, the vocabulary incorporates a wider variety of words, such as action verbs, adjectives, and adverbs (Jia and others 2006). It is important to note that differ\u00ad ent languages possess different so\u00adcial conventions, or rules of how and when to use language, that reflect a culture's orientation toward the role of adults and children as conversational partners. In addition, social conven\u00adtions guide a culture's use of verbal and nonverbal communication strate\u00adgies (Rogoff 2003). Therefore, social conventions influence such things as a child's expectations to initiate dur\u00ading conversation, the amount of talk considered appropriate, and when and how to ask questions or interrupt during conversation (Cultural Diversity and Early Education 1994; Genishi, Stires, and Yung-Chan 2001). In ad\u00addition, the narrative structure of dis\u00adcourse may vary in different cultures and language groups. In U.S. class\u00adrooms, narrative discourse focuses primarily on the communication of information; in other cultures and lan\u00adguage groups, oral narrative stresses social engagement and the importance California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 110 of family interaction (Greenfield 1994; Heath 1983). Reading Reading in the preschool classroom often begins as a social act that engag\u00ad es children in a meaningful language exchange. Reading is learned on the basis of need, purpose, and function. Children come to know the complexity of the act of reading by being read to, by reading with others, and by reading by themselves (Espinosa and Burns 2003; Halliday 2006). This culture is rich with environmental print, such as newspapers, books, and maga\u00adzines; television; and home products, brand names, signs, and billboards. Increasingly, children may have access to print in their home language and in English. Thus, children may enter preschool with some knowledge of the written symbol system of their home language and its associations with real life. Children's oral language in both their home language and English will facilitate their ability to tell and retell stories. As their oral language devel\u00adops, one of the first steps in reading is the development of an appreciation and enjoyment of reading. As children demonstrate an awareness that print carries meaning, they may begin to show progress in their knowledge of the alphabet in English, phonological awareness, and aspects of book han\u00addling and book reading (Developing Literacy in Second-Language Learners 2006; Handbook of Early Literacy Re\u00adsearch 2006). Parents can assist their children on the path to competency in reading by reading to their children in their home language as well as by pro\u00adviding appropriate reading experiences in English (Hammer, Miccio, and Wag-staff 2003; Tabors and Snow 2001). According to Scott-Little, Kagan, and Frelow (2005), early learning founda\u00ad tions in literacy should include book awareness and story sense, literature awareness and comprehension, and phonological and alphabetic aware\u00ad ness. Writing Children come to know written lan\u00ad guage from their perspectives, and their conceptual interpretations are developmental in nature (Clay 2001; Ferreiro and Teberosky 1982). For ex\u00ad ample, children initially will begin to distinguish drawing from writing. Next they will progress to using facsimiles, or imitations, of letter shapes and will eventually use the symbols from their home language to represent meaning. Then they begin to use letters to repre\u00ad sent meaning. These strings of letters are the beginning of the alphabetic principles that govern alphabetic lan\u00ad guages, such as English and Spanish. Children's knowledge of the written language is facilitated by their engage\u00ad ment with letters and practice in writ\u00ad ing their names on their own or with help from others (Handbook of Early Literacy Research 2006). Children will come to know that writing is used for different functions, that it is associ\u00ad ated with oral language, that it names objects in their environments, that it is used to communicate ideas, and that it is used creatively to express their feelings, experiences, and needs. In the early childhood practice, the devel\u00ad opment of early literacy in writing be\u00ad gins with children understanding that the writing process is a mechanism to communicate their ideas, express themselves, and name objects in their world (Scott-Little, Kagan, and Frelow 2005). Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Overall, the teacher plays a crucial role, providing opportunities for chil\u00ad dren to develop their oral language and literacy skills. For example, the teacher can foster development in the area of listening and speaking through the use of questioning strategies, language elaboration and feedback (Cazden 1988; Lyster and Ranta 1997), and the facilitation of informal peer inter\u00adactions with monolingual English-speaking peers (Tabors 1997). Those 111 opportunities will support children's literacy development as well. The teacher can also engage children in storybook reading, create a print-rich environment, structure opportuni\u00adties to use writing for a variety of pur\u00adposes, and provide other activities to further enhance literacy development (Dickinson and Tabors 2002; Yung-Chan 2001).

Focus: Communication of needs 1.1 Use nonverbal com\u00ad munication, such as gestures or behaviors, to seek attention, request objects, or initiate a response from others. 1.1 Combine nonverbal and some verbal communication to be understood by others (may code\u00adswitch\u2014that is, use the home language and English\u2014and use telegraphic and/or formulaic speech). 1.1 Show increasing reliance on verbal communication in English to be under\u00adstood by others. Examples Examples Examples Beginning Uses gestures, such as extend\u00ad ing the hand, pointing, tapping on a person' s shoulder, or an intentional eye gaze, to get a person's attention. Uses her home language to expr ess her wants and needs. Looks at the teacher and indi\u00adcates or points to a toy she wants that is on a shelf. Cries or withdraws to show he is not sur e how to express him\u00ad self effectively (e.g., communi\u00adcates discontent by grimacing or whimpering when an Eng\u00adlish-speaking peer picks up a crayon the child was using and had put down on the table). Uses props, photos, or draw\u00adings that r epresent an item to indicate her needs. Middle Says memorized phrases, such as, \"Let' s go!\" or \"Come on!\" Says in English \"W m\u00e1s! M\u00e1s red paint!\" (Want more! More red paint!) when she runs out of red while painting at an easel. Says in English and Mandarin Chinese, \"Diana play\u00ad ground or \" (Diana wants to go to the playground or the zoo) when talking about weekend plans during circle time. Sings the routine song for an activity (e.g., \"Clean up, clean up, everybody clean up!\"). Pulls the teacher's hand and communicates, \"Come.\" Begins to string together words in English, such as \"Me today yes,\" and \"Mama doctor .\" Later Says, \"Wanna wash my hands,\" after showing the teacher his fingers cov\u00ader ed with glue, to which the teacher has responded, \"What do you need?\" Communicates to another child, \"Help me?\" or \"How do you do that?\" while trying to put a puzzle together . Communicates, \"Move over. Move over some mor e,\" to another child who is sitting next to him during circle time. Learns new, more abstract wor ds, such as \"busy,\" \"stinky,\" or \"grouchy,\" from a story that has been repeated and is heard using that word. Communicates, \"You have to shar e,\" when she wants a crayon another child is holding. ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT * Any means available to the child for communicating could be considered \"speaking\" English (e.g., Signed Exact English, American Sign Language, electronic communication devices). For some children, the home language may be a signed language (e.g., signed Spanish). For the English-language development foundation examples, all Chinese characters are written in the simplified writing system used in mainland China. California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 116 | Speaking 1.0 Children use nonverbal and verbal strategies to communicate with others. Focus: Vocabulary production 1.2 Use vocabulary in the home language that is age-appropriate (as reported by parents, teachers, assistants, or others and with the assistance of an inter\u00adpreter if necessary). 1.2 Begin to use English vocabulary, mainly consisting of concrete nouns and with some verbs and pronouns (telegraphic speech). 1.2 Use new English vocabulary to share knowledge of concepts. Examples Examples Examples Beginning As reported to the teacher by a par ent or other family member, uses her home language to name familiar items at home and make requests (with assis\u00adtance of interpreter if neces\u00adsary), such as, \"Tengo hambre\" (I'm hungry) in Spanish. Uses his home language appr opriately with other chil\u00ad dren in the dramatic play area (as heard by the bilingual assistant). Spontaneously uses her home language during unstructur ed school activities. Interacts with ease while using his home language with his par ents during drop-off and pick-up times. Middle Mouths \"tar\" after peers chorally say \"star\" when the teacher points to a pictur e of a star during circle time and asks, \"What is this?\" Says, \"Me paint\" and smiles in r esponse to another child's statement, \"I like your paint\u00ading.\" Names many animals featured in the book Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? after hearing it read aloud several times. Begins to refer to friends by their first name. Names common objects aloud in English, such as \"juice,\" \"blocks,\" and \"music.\" Later Communicates, \"My mommy had a baby . He cries, cries\" when talking to a peer about a new baby brother. Says, \"B\u00e0 [\"Grandmother\" in V ietnamese], come see the tadpoles! They have two legs now!\" at the end of the day.

Examples Examples Examples Communicates, as follows, with a peer in their home lan\u00adguage about the toys they have at home: Says, \"I have a truck like this one,\" to which the peer responds, \"I have one, too;\" then asks \"Is yours red?\" to which the peer responds, \"Yeah, mine is red.\" Describes what he did at school in detail at home, using his home language (as reported by a family member). Prefers to speak with teachers, peers, or other individuals who speak her home language. After attempting to play with others while using his home language, observes them quietly as they play and speak English. Says in English and Vietnam\u00ad ese, \"My d\u00ec [maternal aunt] gave me,\" when a peer asks who has given the child a new backpack. Stays in the conversation with an English speaker by using the words \"huh\" or \"what\" and possibly combining those words with matching gestures and facial expressions. Says in English and Span\u00ad ish, \"Uh-oh! \u00a1Se cay\u00f3! [It fell] Blocks!\" after a block tower tumbles down, and another child responds, \"Yeah, uh-oh, it fell down.\" Responds, \"Mommy and me\" when a peer painting next to him asks, \"What is that?\" Says, \"Play sand,\" to peer in sand play area after peer says, \"I'm going to play in the sand.\" Converses, as follows, with a peer about their play situa\u00adtion in the block area, where they have built a bus, using large wooden blocks for seats: The peer says, \"I want to be the driver;\" to which the child responds, \"I want to sit here;\" the peer says, \"OK;\" and the child smiles. While playing outside, answers, \"I jump and then run fast. We play ball,\" when the teacher asks, \"What are you doing with your friend?\" Communicates, \"No, I be the daddy,\" in response to a peer who says, \"You be the mommy,\" while in the dramatic play area. In response to the teacher, who asks during a family-style lunch, \"What do you want to eat?\" communicates, \"Want juice and crackers and banana,\" then later communi\u00adcates \"Want more crackers.\" * Children with oral motor involvement who may have difficulty saying words or syllables as they learn to match, synthesize, or analyze syllables and sounds may demonstrate their knowledge by indicating \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to an adult's production of sounds or words or by identifying pictures that represent the products of these manipulations. 118 | Speaking 1.0 Children use nonverbal and verbal strategies to communicate with others. Focus: Utterance length and complexity Beginning Middle Later 1.4 Use a range of utter\u00ad ance lengths in the home language that is age-appropriate (as reported by parents, teachers, assistants, or others, with the assistance of an inter\u00adpreter if necessary).

Focus: Book handling * 3.1 Begin to understand that books are read in a consistent man\u00adner (e.g., in English, pages are turned from right to left and the print is read from top to bottom, left to right; this may vary in other languages). 3.1 Continue to develop an understanding of how to read a book, sometimes applying knowledge of print conventions from the home language. 3.1 Demonstrate an understanding that print in English is organized from left to right, top to bottom, and that pages are turned from right to left when a book is read. Examples Examples Examples Beginning Rotates and flips the book over until the pictur e of George is right side up on the cover of Jorge el curioso (Curious George) and begins to look at the book. A Cantonese-speaking child picks up a book, and flips the pages fr om left to right, look\u00ad ing at the pictures (the appro\u00adpriate way to read a book in Chinese). Middle Turns the pages of a book and talks about illustrations in either English or his home language. Turns the pages of a book, although not necessarily one at a time, talking quietly to herself in Arabic; tracks the print with her finger , moving from top to bottom, right to left (the appro\u00adpriate way to write and read in Arabic). During circle time, turns the page of a big book written in English in the appr opriate direc\u00ad tion when the teacher indicates it is time to turn the page. Later Turns an upside-down book right side up and says, \"Let' s start here,\" when sitting and \"reading\" with a peer in a rocking chair. Imitates the teacher reading to childr en by sitting next to a peer, holding up a book written in English that has been read aloud several times; turns the pages and points to words, tracking the print with her fin\u00adger, moving from left to right and top to bottom. Communicates in Spanish, \"Hab\u00eda una vez\" (Once upon a time) when looking at the first page of a book, looks thr ough the book, and communicates, \"The end\" when reaching the last page. * Some children may need assistance in holding a book or turning the pages, either through assistive technology or through the help of an adult or peer . For example, a book can be mounted so it will not have to be held, and sturdy tabs can be placed on the pages so they are easier to turn. Some children may need to have an adult or peer hold the book and turn the pages.

Assistive technology may be used to facilitate \"writing.\" This may be as simple as building up the width of a marker or pencil so it is easier to grasp or as sophisticated as using a computer. Another possibility would be for an adult or peer to \"write\" for a child with motor challenges, who would then agree or disagree by indicating \"yes\" or \"no\" (Preschool English Learners 2007).

ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education FOUNDATIONS IN Mathematics The preschool learning founda\u00ad tions identify for teachers and other educational stakeholders a set of behaviors in mathematics learning that are typical of children who will be ready to learn what is expected of them in kindergarten. The foundations provide age-appropriate competencies expected for older three\u00adyear-olds (i.e., at around 48 months of age) and for older four-year-olds (i.e., at around 60 months of age). That is, the preschool learning foundations represent goals to be reached by the time a three-year-old is just turning four and a four-year-old is just turn\u00ading five. Focusing on the child's readiness for school in the domain of mathematics learning acknowledges that there must also be appropriate social-emotional, cognitive, and lan\u00adguage development as well as appro\u00adpriate motivation. Many such comple\u00admentary and mutually supporting aspects of the child's overall develop\u00adment are addressed in the preschool learning foundations for other domains (e.g., social-emotional development, language and literacy, and English-language development). These preschool learning founda\u00ad tions are designed with the assump\u00adtion that children's learning takes place in everyday environments: thr ough interactions, relationships, activities, and play that are part of a beneficial preschool experience. The foundations are meant to describe what is typically expected to be observed from young children in their everyday contexts, under conditions appropriate for healthy development, not as aspi\u00adrational expectations under the best possible conditions. They are meant as guidelines and tools to support teach\u00ading, not as a list of items to be taught as isolated skills and not to be used for assessment. Some mathematics foundations men\u00ad tion specific expectations, using exact numbers to describe a counting range (e.g., \"up to thr ee,\" or \"up to four\") at different ages or to set a minimum cri\u00adterion for a particular area (e.g., \"com\u00adpare two groups of up to five objects\"). However, some children may exhibit competencies that go beyond the level described in a particular foundation, while others may need more time to reach that level. The foundations are meant to give teachers a general idea of what is typically expected from children at around 48 or 60 months of age and are not intended to set limits on the way teachers support children's learn\u00ading at different levels. California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 143 MATHEMATICS 144 Children with special needs can demonstrate mathematical knowledge in various ways and do not necessar\u00adily need to engage in motor behavior. For example, a child might indicate to an adult or another child where to place each object in a sorting task. Or a child might ask a teacher to place objects in a particular order to make a repeating pattern. Children with visual impairments might be offered materi\u00adals for counting, sorting, problem solv\u00ading, and so forth that are easily dis\u00adtinguishable by touch. Any means of expression and engagement available to the child should be encouraged. Organization of the Mathematics Foundations The California preschool learning foundations in mathematics cover five main developmental strands: Number Sense, Algebra and Functions (Classi\u00adfication and Patterning), Measurement, Geometry, and Mathematical Reason\u00ading. These strands were identified after a careful review of research, the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM 2000), and the California mathematics content stan\u00addards for kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12). The preschool mathematics founda\u00ad tions expand on the standar ds identi\u00ad fied by the NCTM (2000) for the pre\u00adschool age to include more detailed, age-specific expectations in the key mathematics content areas. In addi\u00adtion, the preschool foundations for mathematics are closely aligned with the California K-12 mathematics content standards, yet there are some particular differences in the organiza\u00adtion of the mathematics strands. In the preschool learning foundations, Mea\u00adsurement and Geometry are two sepa\u00adrate strands rather than one combined strand of Measur ement and Geometry. Also, the preschool learning founda\u00adtions, unlike the K-12 mathematics content standards, do not include a separate strand for statistics, data analysis, and probability. The founda\u00adtions for Patterning are included in the strand for Algebra and Functions, along with the foundations for Classification. The numbering system for the mathematics foundations follows the same numbering system used in the Califor nia K-12 mathematics content standards. The major divisions within a strand are referred to as substrands and are numbered 1.0, 2.0, and so forth. Each substrand is divided into a column for children \"around 48 months of age\" and a column for chil\u00addren \"around 60 months of age\" on each page. The description for younger preschool children is different from the one for older preschool children. The separate foundations are written under their substrand column by age range and are numbered sequentially. Where a substrand is numbered 1.0, the foundations under the substrand would be 1.1, 1.2, and so forth, where a substrand is numbered 2.0, the foun\u00addations under the substrand would be 2.1, 2.2, and so forth for both columns. Immediately below each foundation, a few examples ar e given. The examples are meant to clarify the foundation by illustrating how the competency described in the foundation might be observed in the preschool environment. They are not meant to be used as a checklist of the knowledge and skills that a child must demonstrate before the teacher can decide that a compe\u00adtency is present. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education A developmental progression by age range is articulated within each sub- strand. That is, the substrand descrip\u00adtion and foundations for children at around 60 months of age are written to indicate a higher level of development than the foundations for children at around 48 months of age in that same substrand. For some foundations, the change between 48- and 60-month\u00adold children is more pronounced than for other foundations. Although there is a developmental progression from around 48 months of age to around 60 months of age within a substrand, the order in which the strands are presented is not meant to indicate any sense of developmental progression from strand to strand or from sub-strand to substrand within a strand. At the end of the foundations, bib\u00ad liographic notes pr ovide a review of the research base for the foundations. Following the bibliographic notes, a list of references for the entire set of math\u00adematics foundations is provided. Brief explanations of each strand are as follows: Number Sense\u2014important aspects of counting, number relationships, and operations Preschool children develop an initial qualitative understanding of a quan\u00ad tity of small groups of objects without actually counting the objects. This understanding is referred to as visually knowing or \"subitizing.\" It supports the ability to compare small groups of objects: to know if the groups are the same, if one group is larger (smaller), or which has more (fewer). Also devel\u00adoping is the ability to approach simple arithmetic-like operations on groups of objects with ideas such 145 to,\" \"putting together,\" \"taking apart,\" \"taking away,\" and so forth. Preschool is the time when children learn to recite the numbers in order, recognize numer\u00adals, and begin to incorporate the idea of one-to-one-correspondence and true counting. This is also a time when pre\u00adschool children begin to learn about cardinality, which is the concept of knowing the last number named is the quantity of objects counted. Algebra and Functions (Classification and Patterning)\u2014 sorting and classifying objects; recognizing, extending, and creating patterns Classification involves sorting, group\u00ad ing, or categorizing objects according to established criteria. Analyzing, com\u00adparing, and classifying objects provide a foundation for algebraic thinking. Although preschool children may not know how all the objects in a mixed set can be sorted or be able to say much about why some objects go together, they do begin to group like with like at around 48 months of age and will do so more completely at around 60 months of age. These foundations use the idea of sorting objects by some attribute. The term \"attribute\" is used here to indicate a property of objects, such as color or shape, that would be appar\u00adent to a preschooler and that the pre\u00adschooler could use as a basis for group\u00ading or sorting. A younger preschool child is expected to show some sorting of a group of objects, but not necessar\u00adily do so completely or without errors. A young preschooler might sort farm animals but remove only the cows and leave the rest ungrouped, and there may be a pig or two or a horse mixed in. But an older preschool child might MATHEMATICS California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 146 MATHEMATICS make a group of all cows and a group of all pigs and a group of all horses. This competency is the precursor to many important mathematics abilities that will come later (e.g., the logic of what belongs in a set and what does not, grouping terms in an algebraic expression, data analysis, and graph\u00ading). Sorting and grouping in preschool will help prepare children for those later steps. Researchers Seo and Gins-burg (2004) point out that preschool children do not often spontaneously choose to do sorting activities on their own. Therefore, sorting is an area in which teacher facilitation and model\u00ading across a range of situations and contexts is particularly important. The teacher should note that how a child sorts depends on the situation and the child's perception of the activity. Thinking about patterns is another important precursor for learning math\u00adematics in general and for learning algebra in particular (Clements 2004a). During the preschool years, children develop their abilities to recognize, identify, and duplicate patterns and to extend and create simple repeating patterns. Although less research has been conducted for preschoolers in patterning than in other areas, such as numbers and counting, recent stud\u00adies (Klein and Starkey 2004; Starkey, Klein, and Wakelely 2004) provide information about the development of patterning skills. Children first learn to identify the core unit in a repeat\u00ading pattern. Once they are able to identify the initial unit of a pattern, they can extend a pattern by predict\u00ading what comes next. Teacher facili\u00adtation and modeling are particularly important in introducing the notion of patterns, extending it to more aspects of the child's environment and daily activities, and encouraging the child's attempts to cr eate patterns. Measurement\u2014comparing and ordering objects by length, weight, or capacity; precursors of measurement Measuring is assigning a number of units to some property, such as length, area, or weight, of an object. Although much more learning will take place later as children become increasingly competent with core mea\u00adsurement concepts, preschool is when children gain many of the precursors to this kind of understanding about comparing, ordering, and measuring things. For example, young preschool children are becoming aware that objects can be compared by weight, height, or length and use such words as \"heavier,\" \"taller,\" or \"longer\" to make comparisons. They begin to compare objects directly to find out which is heavier, taller, and so forth. They can compare length by placing objects side by side and order three or more objects by size. By the time chil\u00addren are around 60 months old, they develop the understanding that mea\u00adsuring length involves repeating equal-size units and counting the number of units. They may start measuring length by laying multiple copies of same-size units end to end (Clements 2004a). Geometry\u2014properties of objects (shape, size, position) and the relation of objects in space Geometry is a tool for understand\u00ad ing relations among shapes and spatial properties mathematically. Preschool children learn to recognize and name two-dimensional shapes, such as a circle, square, rectangle, triangle, and Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education other shapes. At first, they recognize geometric shapes by their overall holis\u00adtic physical appearance. As they gain more experience comparing, sorting, and analyzing shapes, children learn to attend to individual attributes and characteristics of different shapes. Younger preschool children use shapes in isolation, while older preschool chil\u00addren use shapes to create images of things they know and may combine shapes into new shapes (Clements 2004a, 2004b). In the early preschool years, children also develop spatial reasoning. They can visualize shapes in different positions and learn to describe the direction, distance, and location of objects in space. Teachers can facilitate children's development of geometry and spatial thinking by offering many opportunities to explore attributes of different shapes and to use vocabulary words about the posi\u00adtion of objects in space. Mathematical Reasoning\u2014using mathematical thinking to solve problems in play and everyday activities Children in preschool encounter sit\u00ad uations in play and everyday activities 147 that require them to adapt and change their course of action. Although they may not realize it, some situations call for mathematical reasoning\u2014to determine a quantity (e.g., how many spoons?) or to reason geometrically (e.g., what shape will fit?). Other situations require general reasoning. For preschoolers, when the context is familiar and comfortable enough, a simple strategy may be applied to solve an immediate problem\u2014even something as simple as counting the number of objects held in the hand or carrying a block over to see if there are others like it. A young preschool child may begin this process by trying a strategy that is not always effective. An older preschool child may try sev\u00aderal strategies, finally finding one that works. The important point is that both younger and older preschool children learn through reasoning mathematically. As the above examples suggest, encouraging young children to engage in mathematical reasoning is not only beneficial in itself, it also opens the door to children's explora\u00adtion of the other mathematics foun\u00addations, such as geometric shapes, counting, and classification. MATHEMATICS California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 MATHEMATICS 148 Number Sense* At around 48 months of age 1.0 Children begin to understand numbers and quantities in their ever yday environment. At around 60 months of age 1.0 Children expand their under\u00adstanding of numbers and quantities in their ever yday environment. 1.1 Recite numbers in order to ten with increasing accuracy. 1.1 Recite numbers in order to twenty with increasing accuracy. Examples Examples 1.2 Begin to recognize and name a few written numerals. 1.2 Recognize and know the name of some written numerals. Examples Examples Recites one to ten incompletely or with errors while playing (e.g., \"one, two, three, four, five, seven, ten\"). Recites one to ten while walking. Recites one to ten while singing. Communicates, \"That's a one,\" when playing with magnetic numerals. Indicates or points to the numerals on a cube and names, \"thr ee, two, five.\" Identifies the numeral 3 on the page of the Five Little Speckled Frogs book while sitting with a teacher. Recites one to twenty incompletely or with errors (e.g., \"one, two, thr ee, four, five, . . . nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fifteen , seventeen, eighteen, twenty\"). Chants one to twenty in order while swinging. Recites one to twenty to show her friend how high she can count. Names some numerals found in books or during a game. Points to numerals in a number puzzle as the teacher names them. * Throughout these mathematics foundations many examples describe the child manipulating objects. Children with motor impairments may need assistance from an adult or peer to manipulate objects in order to do things such as count, sort, compare, order, measure, create patterns, or solve problems. A child might also use adaptive materials (e.g., large manipula\u00adtives that are easy to grasp). Alternately, a child might demonstrate knowledge in these areas without directly manipulating objects. For example, a child might direct a peer or teacher to place several objects in order from smallest to largest. Children with visual impairments might be offered materials for counting, sorting, or problem solving that are easily distin\u00adguishable by touch. Their engagement is also facilitated by using containers, trays, and so forth that contain their materials and clearly define their work space. Some children may not be able to count by either saying the numbers or signing them. Any means available to the child for demonstrating knowledge of numbers in order should be encouraged. For example, a child may indicate or touch number cards or might respond yes or no when an adult counts. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Number Sense | 149 At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age MATHEMATICS 1.3 Identify, without counting, the number of objects in a collection of up to three objects (i.e., subitize). 1.3 Identify, without counting, the number of objects in a collection of up to four objects (i.e., subitize). Examples Examples Perceives directly (visually, tactilely, or auditorily) the number of objects in a small group without needing to count them. Indicates or points to a pile of blocks and communicates, \"Three of them.\" Attends to the child next to her at snack time and communicates, \"Clovey has two.\" Looks briefly at a picture with three cats and immediately communicates the quantity by saying \"three\" or showing three fingers. Perceives directly (visually, tactilely, or auditorily) the number of objects in a small group without needing to count them. Looks briefly at a picture of four frogs and immedi\u00ad ately communicates the quantity four. During storytime, puts her hand on the picture of four ladybugs and communicates, \"Four lady\u00adbugs.\" Correctly points out, \"That's three cars there.\" 1.4 Count up to five objects, using one-to-one correspondence (one object for each number word) with increasing accuracy.* 1.4 Count up to ten objects, using one-to-one correspondence (one object for each number word) with increasing accuracy.* Examples Examples After building a block tower, counts the number of blocks by pointing to the first block and com\u00admunicating \"one,\" then pointing to the next block and communicating \"two.\" The child counts up to five blocks. Indicates or points to each toy in a line while communicating, \"One, two, thr ee, four, five.\" Indicates or points to a flower in the garden and communicates, \"one,\" then points to another flower and communicates, \"two.\" The child counts up to seven dif ferent flowers. Counts ten children by identifying them one by one during cir cle time. Counts the blocks in a pile, keeping track of which blocks have alr eady been counted. Counts out eight napkins in preparation for snack time. * Children with motor disabilities may need assistance manipulating objects in order to count them. Children may also demonstrate knowledge of object counting by using eye-pointing or by counting while an adult or another child touches or moves the objects. California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 150 | Number Sense At around 48 months of age At around 60 months of age MATHEMATICS 1.5 Use the number name of the last object counted to answer the question, \"How many . . . ?\" 1.5 Understand, when counting, that the number name of the last object counted represents the total number of objects in the group (i.e., cardinality). Examples Examples Counts the number of sticks in her hand, com\u00ad municating, \"one, two, three, four, five.\" The teacher asks, \"How many sticks do you have?\" and the child communicates \"five.\" When asked, \"How many cars do you have?\" two four\" and communicat\u00ading, \"one, two, thr ee, four, five, six.\" A friend asks, \"How many beads do you have?\" and the child replies, \"six.\" After giving away some bears, counts the r emaining bears to find out how many are left and communicates, \"I now have six bears.\" Lines up cars on a track and counts, then communicates, \"My train has seven cars!\" Counts dolls, \"one, two, three, four\" and communicates, \"Ther e are four dolls.\" Counts her sticks and communicates, \"I have five,\" when the teacher asks during an activity , \"Does everyone have five sticks?\" Counts five apple slices and recognizes there is one slice of apple for each of the five childr en around the table. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education Number Sense | 151 At around 48 months of age 2.0 Children begin to understand number r elationships and operations in their everyday environment. At around 60 months of age 2.0 Children expand their under\u00adstanding of number r elation\u00ad ships and operations in their everyday environment. 2.1 Compare visually (with or without counting) two groups of objects that are obviously equal or nonequal and communicate, \"more\" or \"same.\"* 2.1 Compare, by counting or matching, two groups of up to five objects and communicate, \"more,\" \"same as,\" or \"fewer\" (or \"less\").* Examples Examples Examines two groups of counting bears, one with two bears and the other with six bears, and indicates or points to the group of six bears when asked which group has more. Communicates, \"I want more\u2014she's got more stamps than me\" during a small group activity. Communicates, \"We have the same,\" when referring to apple slices during snack time. Counts the number of rocks he has and the num\u00ad ber a friend has and communicates, \"Five and five, you have the same as me.\" Compares a group of four bears to a group of five bears and communicates, \"This one has less.\" Counts her own sand toys, then counts a friend's and communicates, \"You have more.\" 2.2 Understand that adding to (or taking away) one or more objects from a group will increase (or decrease) the number of objects in the group. 2.2 Understand that adding one or taking away one changes the number in a small group of objects by exactly one. Examples Examples MATHEMATICS Has three beads, takes another, and communi\u00ad cates, \"Now I have more beads.\" When the teacher adds more cats on the flannel boar d, indicates that there are now more cats. While playing bakery, communicates that after selling some bagels ther e are now fewer bagels in the bakery shop. Gives away two dolls and communicates that now she has fewer . Adds another car to a pile of five to have six, just like his friend. Removes one animal from a collection of eight animals and communicates, \"She has seven now .\" Correctly predicts that if one more car is added to a gr oup of four cars, there will be five. *Comparison may be done visually, tactilely, or auditorily.

Examples Examples Combines his blocks with a pile of his friend's blocks and communicates, \"Now we have more.\" Puts together crayons from two separate boxes to have more. Puts together the red bears and the yellow bears to have a bigger group of bears. Refers to a collection of six balloons and com\u00ad municates, \"Three red balloons for me and three green ones for you.\" Indicates seven by holding up five fingers on one hand and two fingers on another. Removes three (of five) ducks from the flannel board, communicating, \"Three left, and only two stay\" when acting a story. 2.4 Solve simple addition and subtrac\u00ad tion problems nonverbally (and often verbally) with a very small number of objects (sums up to 4 or 5). 2.4 Solve simple addition and subtrac\u00ad tion problems with a small number of objects (sums up to 10), usually by counting . Examples Examples Recognizes that one ball together with another one makes a total of two balls. The child may create a matching collection or say or indicate \"two.\" Adds one car to a train with two cars and indicates the total number of cars in train by showing thr ee fingers. Recognizes that only two bananas are left after giving away one of thr ee bananas to a friend. Takes away one flower from a group of four flowers on the flannel boar d, while acting out a story, and communicates that only three flowers are left. During a small group activity, count oranges on the flannel boar d and communicate, \"There are six oranges.\" The teacher puts one more orange on the board and asks, \"How many oranges do we have now?\" Some say seven; others first count, \"One, two three, four, five, six, seven\" and then say seven. Adds two more cups to a group of two, says that ther e are four cups.

California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 160 Bibliographic Notes MATHEMATICS Number Sense Research suggests that children start developing number sense in early infancy (Feigenson, Dehaene, and Spelke 2004). Much of what preschool children know about number is closely related to and depends on their under\u00adstanding and mastery of counting (Adding It Up 2001). Counting builds a foundation for children's future under\u00adstanding of mathematics, and this basic skill becomes the reference point as children learn to manipulate larger quantities in the future. Children's understanding of num\u00ad bers is initially qualitative, as they gain an understanding of \"number-ness\" (e.g., three-ness, four-ness) with small quantities, using subitizing: visually knowing \"how many\" are in a set with\u00adout actually counting them (Clements 2004a; Fuson 1988, 1992a). Counting is a natural activity for young children as their everyday contexts often involve numbers and quantities, although it requires them to have a sophisticated set of skills based on many experi\u00adences to be able to count accurately. Literature suggests that the three major basic building blocks for count\u00ading are learning of (1) the sequence of number words, (2) one-to-one corre\u00adspondence, and (3) cardinality (know\u00ading that the last number assigned to the last object counted gives the total number in the set) (Adding It Up 2001; Becker 1989; others 1997; Sophian 1988). Children are likely to experience the aspects of counting at different times and in different contexts. As they gain more experience, they start to connect and coordinate these individual concepts and develop skill in counting with flu\u00adency. The specific ways in which these different aspects of counting develop depend largely on individual children and their experiences. Research, how\u00adever, is in agreement that very young children (ages up to three) may be able to handle small quantities first (groups of two to three), and as they grow older, they are more likely to be able to manage larger sets (by age five, groups of 10). Cardinality is typically devel\u00adoped between the ages of three and four years (Fuson 1988). The preschool years are a critical time for children to master the art of counting small numbers of objects. Young children's understanding of quantities and numbers is largely related to counting, as noted in the previous section. Another important factor in children's development of number sense is early experience with number operations (Adding It Up 2001; Clements 2004a; Hiebert and others 1997; Principles and Standards for School Mathematics 2000). Research shows that counting and number operations are related and that chil\u00addren as young as three years are able to understand simple visual number patterns that involve number opera\u00adtions such as, \"two fingers and two fin\u00adgers make four\" (Fuson 1988, 1992a). When children enter elementary schools, much of their engagement Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education with mathematics will be devoted to learning how quantitative and logical relationships work in the world, and number operations hold a key to such learning (Adding It Up 2001; Principles and Standards for School Mathematics 2000). Although standard mathemati\u00ad cal and abstract symbols (e.g., +, =) ar e absent from those early experiences with math operations, informal and early mathematics experience becomes the foundation for children's later learning in this area. Children gener\u00adally use a diverse range of strategies to make sense of mathematical situations around them, and this diversity of thinking usually becomes a feature of their subsequent mathematical devel\u00adopment (Adding It Up 2001). Young children initially understand a quantity as an aggr egate of single units (Fuson 1988, 1988; Hiebert and others 1997; Geary 1994). Thus, when asked to combine two sets of objects, they count the two different sets starting from \"one\" to determine the answer (the counting-all strategy); therefore, the development of num\u00adber operations is closely related to the way they learn to count. As chil\u00addren gain experiences, they gradually develop more sophisticated methods by abstracting the quantity of one of the two groups (one of the addends) and starting to count on (or count up, in subtraction) from that number. Children eventually become adept at decomposing numbers into smaller chunks for the purpose of adding and subtracting, although this method is usually not formally taught in U.S. classrooms (Fuson, 1992a). Never\u00adtheless, preschool children's first expe\u00adriences with the concept of decomposi\u00adtion of a number into smaller groups of 161 numbers is the beginning of an impor\u00adtant development in mathematical reasoning. Learning the concept that groups or chunks of numbers make up larger numbers supports the under\u00adstanding of arithmetic operations. For example, children's emerging under\u00adstanding of different ways the number 10 can be decomposed into groups (e.g., 5 + 5, 4 + 6) contributes to their future learning of multidigit addition and subtraction (i.e., the operation of making 10 and moving it to the next position to the left of a multidigit number). Algebra and Functions During the preschool years chil\u00ad dren develop beginning algebraic con\u00adcepts as they sort and classify objects, observe patterns in their environment, and begin to predict what comes next based on a recognized pattern. Sorting items, classifying them, and working with patterns help children to bring order, organization, and predictability to their world. Classification and the analysis of patterns provide a foun\u00addation for algebraic thinking as chil\u00addren develop the ability to recognize relationships, form generalizations, and see the connection between com\u00admon underlying structures (Principles and Standards for School Mathematics 2000; Clements 2004a). Classification is the systematic arrangement of objects into gr oups according to established criteria and involves sorting, grouping, and cat\u00adegorizing. Classification is at the heart of identifying what is invariant across groups of mathematical objects or mathematical processes. Clements (2004a) suggests that analyzing, com\u00adparing, and classifying objects help MATHEMATICS California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 MATHEMATICS 162 create new knowledge of objects and their relationships; in Developmental Guidelines for Geometry, he recom\u00admends a classification activity in which four-year-olds match shapes to identify congruent and noncongruent two-dimensional shapes. Certainly, identifying triangles from within a set of figures that include examples and nonexamples of triangles is essentially a classification exercise. But classifica\u00adtion should not be reserved solely for work with shapes; rather, it should be included in young children's math\u00adematical activities as it also facilitates work with patterns and data analysis. The developmental continuum for data analysis starts with classification and counting and evolves into data repre\u00adsentation (e.g., graphing). Seo and Ginsburg (2004) were inter\u00ad ested in how frequently four- and five-year-olds engaged in mathemati\u00adcal activities during play. Interestingly enough, after studying 90 of these children the researchers report that classification activities were the least frequently occurring of the mathemati\u00adcal activities observed. Only 2 percent of the mathematical activities observed could be categorized as classification activities. Patterns help children learn to find or der, cohesion, and predictability in seemingly disorganized situations. The recognition and analysis of pat\u00adterns clearly provide a foundation for the development of algebraic think\u00ading (Clements 2004a). Identifying and extending patterns are important pre\u00adschool activities. For example, Gins-burg, Inoue, and Seo (1999) report that the detection, prediction, and creation of patterns with shapes are the most frequent mathematical activities in preschool. However, compared with counting, little is known about young childr en's knowledge of patterns. Patterns involve replication, comple\u00ad tion, pr ediction, extension, and descrip\u00ad tion or generalization (Greenes 1999). In preschool years, young children gradually develop the concept of pat\u00adterns that includes recognizing a pat\u00adtern, describing a pattern, creating a pattern, and extending a pattern. To understand a pattern, children should be able to identify similarities and dif\u00adferences among elements of a pattern, note the number of elements in the repeatable group, identify when the first group of elements begins to repli\u00adcate itself, and make predictions about the order of elements based on given information. Klein and Starkey (2004) report that young childr en experience difficulty at the beginning of the year with a fundamental property of repeating pat\u00adterns: identifying the core unit of the pattern. However, experiences can have a positive impact on young children's knowledge of duplication and extension of patterns (Klein and Starkey 2004; Starkey, Klein, and Wakeley 2004). In a study about the kinds of mathe\u00ad matical activities in which young childr en engage during play, Seo and Ginsburg (2004) found that four- and five-year-old children most often engage in \"pattern and shape\" activities, which the authors describe as \". . . identifying or creating patterns or shapes or exploring geometric properties and relationships. For example, Jennie makes a bead necklace, putting plastic beads into a string one by one. She uses only yellow and red beads for her necklace and makes a yellow-red color pattern\" (Seo and Ginsburg 2004, 94). Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 163 These researchers provide some evidence that young children, when engaged in play, do generate their ow n repeating patterns. In preschool set\u00adtings, teachers can encourage chil\u00addren to share their patterns created with objects, bodies, and sounds in relation to music, art, and movement (Smith 2001). Although the cited work is invaluable to the education of youn g children and the development of pre\u00adschool learning foundations, much research remains to be done. The developmental trajectory of patterns has been characterized as evolving from three-year-old children' s ability to identify repeating pattern to four-year-old children's ability to engage in pattern duplication and pattern extension (Klein and Starkey 2004). The perception of the initial un it plays a fundamental role in both the duplication and extension of patterns. Measurement Measurement is defined as a mathe \u00ad matical process that involves assignin g numbers to a set of continuous quan\u00adtities (Clements and Stephen 2004). Technically, measurement is a numbe r that indicates a comparison between the attribute of the object being measured and the same attribute of a given unit of measure. To under\u00adstand the concept of measurement, children must be able to decide on th e attribute of objects to measure, select the units to measure the attribute, and use measuring skills and tools to compare the units (Clements 2004a; Van de Walle 2001). To accomplish this task, children should understand the different units that are assigned to physical quantities such as length, height, weight, volume, and nonphysi\u00adcal quantities such as time, and tem\u00adperature (Smith 2001). Measurement is one of the main real-world applications of mathemat\u00adics. Shaw and Blake (1998) note that in children's mathematics curricula, measurement is an integration of number operation and geometry in everyday mathematical experiences. A typical developmental trajectory involves children first learning to use words that represent quantities or magnitude of a certain attribute. Then, children begin to demonstrate an abil\u00adity to compare two objects directly and recognize equality or inequality. For example, they may compare two objects to determine which is longer or heavier. After comparing two items, children develop the ability to compare three or more objects and to order them by size (e.g. from shortest to lon\u00adgest) or by other attributes. Finally, children learn to measure, connecting numbers to attributes of objects, such as length, weight, amount, and area (Clements 2004a; Ginsburg, Inoue, and Seo 1999). This theoretical sequence estab\u00ad lishes the basis for the measur ement strand. Children's familiarity with the language required to describe mea\u00adsurement relationships\u2014such as lon\u00adger, taller, shorter, the same length, holds less, holds the same amount\u2014is an important foundation for the con\u00adcept of measurement (Greenes 1999) that should be directly addressed in preschool and, thus, is incorporated as part of the mathematics foundations for children at around 48 months of age. Young preschoolers learn to use words that describe measurement rela\u00adtionships as they compare two objects MATHEMATICS California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 MATHEMATICS 164 directly to determine equality or inequality, and as they order three or more objects by size. Older preschool children begin to make progress in reasoning about measuring quantities with less dependence on perceptual cues (Clements 2004a, Clements and Stephen 2004). Children start to com\u00adpare the length of objects, indirectly, using transitive reasoning, and to measure the length of objects often by using nonstandard units. They develop the ability to think of the length of a small unit (i.e., a block) as part of the length of the object being measured and to place the smaller unit repeat\u00adedly along the length of the larger object. Geometry Geometry is the study of space and shape (Clements 1999). Geometry and spatial reasoning offer a way to describe, interpret, and imagine the world. They also provide an important tool for the study of mathematics and science. The research literature shows that young children bring to kinder\u00adgarten a great deal of knowledge about shapes. This finding is important because teachers and curriculum writers seem to underestimate the knowledge about geometric figures that students bring to school. This under\u00adestimation and teachers' lack of confi\u00addence in their own geometry knowledge usually result in teachers' minimizing the time dedicated to teaching geom\u00adetry concepts to children (Clements 2004a; Lehrer, Jenkins, and Osana 1998). The literature recommends that young children be given the opportu\u00adnity to work with many varied exam\u00adples of a particular shape and many \"nonexamples\" of a particular shape (Clements 2004a). For example, children need to experience examples of triangles that are not just isosce\u00adles triangles. They need to experience triangles that are skewed\u2014that is, a triangle where the \"top\" is not \"in the middle,\" as in an isosceles triangle. They need also to experience triangles with a varying aspect ratio\u2014the ratio of height to base. Without the opportu\u00adnity to experience a wide range of triangles, children may come to \"expect\" triangles to have an aspect ratio that is close to 1 and, conse\u00adquently, often reject appropriate exam\u00adples of triangles because they are too \"pointy\" or too \"flat.\" In addition, chil\u00addren need to experience nonexamples of triangles so that they can develop a robust and explicit sense of the prop\u00aderties of a triangle. In 1959, Van Hiele developed a hier\u00ad archy of ways of understanding spatial ideas (Van Hiele 1986). The hierarchy consists of the following levels: 1\u2014Visualization, 2\u2014Analysis, 3\u2014Abstraction, 4\u2014Deduction, and 5\u2014Rigor. Van Hiele's theory has become the most influential fac\u00adtor in geometry curricula. Recently, researchers have suggested a level of geometric thinking that exists before the visual level: a \"precognition\" level in which children cannot yet reliably identify circles, triangles, and squares (Clements 2004b; Clements and others 1999). Shape knowledge involves not only r ecognition and naming but also an understanding of shape characteristics and properties. One way in which chil\u00addren demonstrate this understanding is through their ability to put together shapes into new shapes (Clements Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 2004a). The developmental trajec\u00ad tory for the composition of geometric figures evolves as children begin to use shapes individually to represent objects, progress to covering an outline with shapes, and eventually be able to combine shapes without an outline and make shape units (i.e., smaller shapes that make up a larger shape that is itself a part of a larger pic\u00adture) (Clements 2004a; Clements and Sarama 2000). Developing a sense of space is as important as developing spatial sense. Spatial sense allows people to get around in the world and know the rel\u00adative positions of artifacts in the physi\u00adcal environment (Smith 2001). Spatial reasoning involves location, direction, distance, and identification of objects (Clements 1999). Very young children do develop an initial spatial sense to get around in the world. For example, young preschoolers learn to navigate their way around their school and classroom, and this ability suggests that they have created a mental map of those places. In the beginning stages of spatial reasoning, children use their own position as a point of reference for locating positions and orientations of objects in space, such as in/out and above/below. Then, children develop the ability to relate positions of two objects external to themselves or in themselves such as in front/in back, forward/backward, near/far, close to/far from (Greenes 1999). There is evidence that even preschool children develop mapping skills. They can build maps using familiar objects and as they get older, build imagery maps in familiar classroom settings (Blaut and Stea 1974; Gouteux Young 1994). 165 Children's growth in understanding and knowledge about shape and space is thought to develop through educa\u00adtion and experience rather than merely through maturational factors. There\u00adfore, it is important not only to create a foundation for addressing this math\u00adematics area, but also to encourage preschool programs to provide children with plenty of rich and varied opportu\u00adnities to engage with various aspects of geometry. Engagement should be done in such a way that it grounds young children's experiences with shapes in action. As a result, the preschool foundations tend to de-emphasize the \"naming\" of shapes in this foundation; rather, they focus on children's ability to identify shapes, whether verbally or nonverbally. Mathematical Reasoning Mathematical proficiency entails strategic competence, adaptive rea\u00adsoning, conceptual understanding, productive disposition, and procedural fluency (Adding It Up 2001). Each of these competencies sets the founda\u00adtion for what is often called problem solving or mathematical reasoning. Most preschool children by at least thr ee years of age show that they can solve problems involving simple addi\u00adtion and subtraction, often by model\u00ading with real objects or thinking about sets of objects. In a study by Huttenlo\u00adcher, Jordan, and Levine (1994), pre\u00adschoolers were presented with a set of objects of a given size that were then hidden in a box, followed by another set of objects that were also placed in the box. The children were asked to produce a set of objects correspond\u00ading to the total number of objects contained in the box. The majority MATHEMATICS California Department of Education Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 MATHEMATICS 166 of three-year-olds were able to solve these types of problems when they involved adding or subtracting a single item, but their performance decreased rapidly as the size of the second set increased. Preschoolers demonstrate the con\u00ad ceptual understanding and procedural fluency necessary for them to solve simple word problems (Fuson 1992b). Simple word problems are thought to be easier for preschool children to solve than number problems that are not cast in a context (Carpenter and others 1993). All ages of problem-solvers are influenced by the context of the problem and tend to perform better with more contextual informa\u00adtion (Wason and Johnson-Laird 1972; Shannon 1999). However, preschool children tend to be more heavily influ\u00adenced by the context of the problem than do older children and adults, thus limiting their ability to solve num\u00adber problems that are not presented in context. Alexander, White, and Daugherty (1997) pr opose three conditions for reasoning in young children: the chil\u00addren must have a sufficient knowledge base, the task must be understandable and motivating, and the context of the task must be familiar and comfortable to the problem-solver. These conditions probably apply to all ages of problem-solvers (Wason and Johnson-Laird 1972; Shannon 1999). Researchers indicate that four- and five-year -olds engage in advanced mathematical explorations spontane\u00adously in their play (Ginsburg, Inoue, and Seo 1999; Seo and Ginsburg 2004). In their everyday activities, young children spontaneously engage in a variety of mathematical explora\u00adtions and applications such as pattern analysis, change and transforma\u00adtion, comparison of magnitude, and estimations. Any logical thinking that children exhibit to solve real-life prob\u00adlems could potentially be considered beginning mathematical reasoning. For example, children distributing the same (or almost same) amount of snack to classmates or using strate\u00adgies to solve immediate situations in play are situations in which children begin to demonstrate their ability to solve mathematical problems. Thus, it is crucial for teachers to be attuned to the fact that mathematical reason\u00ading happens all the time in children's lives, and teachers would do well to use those occasions to nurture chil\u00addren's mathematical thinking skills. The examples illustrate the authentic problems that occur in preschoolers' everyday activities and all the different skills involved in mathematical reason\u00ading and problem solving. Preschool Learning Foundations, Volume 1 California Department of Education 167 Glossary MATHEMATICS attribute. A property or characteristic of an object or a person; attributes such as size, color, or shape would be appar\u00adent to a preschool child and would be used in grouping or sorting cardinality. The concept that the number name applied to the last object counted represents the total number of objects in the group (the quantity of objects counted) classification. The sorting, grouping, or categorizing of objects accor ding to established criteria one-to-one correspondence. One and only one number word is used for each object in the array of objects being counted simple repeating pattern. A pattern with two repeating elements: A-B-A-B, A-A\u00adB-B, A-B-B-A-B-B subitize.
