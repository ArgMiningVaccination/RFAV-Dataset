If vaccines are as safe and wonderful and seemingly miraculous as their advocates repeatedly state, why then, are people collectively sicker than ever? Why have we not seen a dramatic decrease in the frequency and severity of human disease, as touted by those fighting to make them absolutely mandatory here in the United States? Why the exact opposite? The answer, simply, is that there is big, big money in keeping people sick. Sick patients need medications, lots of medications. And it will shock no one to hear that the cost of today's medicine and prescription drugs has done nothing but escalate over the past two to three decades. If you can create the right setting of sickness at a young age, without killing them outright, you will essentially have a huge base of customers for life. Conversely, a healthy population does not do much financial good for the bottom lines of those who stand to benefit from their sale, manufacture and mandates. A chronically sick population, however, ensures a lifetime of customers who need, not want, but need what you're selling. Frequency of Vaccinations in America Up until about the 1980s, children received only a fraction of the total inoculations that they are being given today. Today, things are different. You may not be going to the doctor as often for vaccinations, but there's a caveat to that. Many vaccines are bundled - something we'll review in more detail throughout this section of the website. In the interim, here are a few interesting facts on today's common vaccination schedule: - By their first birthday, following the recommended vaccination schedule, your child will have received a total of 26 doses, from over a dozen different vaccines. - By the time they reach their 18th birthday, your developing teenage will have received a total of 69 doses of an astounding 16 different vaccines. - Infants from 12-16 months are frequently given over a dozen vaccinations in a single pediatrician's office visit, grouped into single-shot injections, with virtually no clinical research demonstrating either their safety or health risks. - Much of the funding for vaccine research, comes directly from the companies who manufacture the vaccinations. The Unknown Dangers of Multi-Vaccination Synergistic Effects Introducing even one highly toxic chemical concoction into the body is concerning enough. But today's kids don't get just one, they get dozens, often grouped together to lessen the number of shots. But of what benefit and purpose is this being done? For convenience? For the benefit of the child's health? Or is it to prevent mom and dad from asking questions they would rather not answer, about the almost unfathomable frequency of these non-natural inoculations? Stacking, or layering, vaccines is one of the foremost concerns among parents looking for real answers to how these inoculations may affect their children during youth and into adulthood. To understand this a little better, you need to know the basics of biological synergism. When you introduce a substance into the human body, it will obviously react in any number of ways. When substances (be it medicines, nutrients, toxins, proteins, etc) are delivered simultaneously or in groups, they function synergistically - which means their effects, good or bad, can be increased based on the presence of one another. This is commonly done with beneficial dietary supplement formulas, such as antioxidants, vitamins A, C, and E, and other natural compounds, to encourage them to work more effectively in a group. But what happens when two, six or even a dozen harsh chemicals, bacteria and viruses are suddenly forced upon a young, developing human system? Is it safe to assume that their effects are also extrapolated, and if so, why are so many parents unfamiliar with the concept of synergist effects? Some Current, Documented Health Statistics Today, one out of every six children in the United States is diagnosed with some form of learning disability. The occurrence of Autism diagnosis has increased substantially over the past two and a half decades, from 1 in every 10,000 (1990), to approximately 1 in 70 by current estimates. Over half of all children are reported to have suffered a chronic illness by their 18th birthday. Cancer is now the leading cause of death among children. Over 25,000 adverse vaccine-related reactions are reported each year, including severe allergic reaction, non-treatable illnesses and death. The number of unreported reactions remains a mystery to all. Infant mortality rates are closely associated with the overall number of vaccinations a child has received before their first birthday. "}
