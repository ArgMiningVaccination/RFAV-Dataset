Galloway, MD, F ACP , F ACC,National Native American Cardiology Program, Indian HealthService, Flagstaff, Arizona, and Associate Professor of ClinicalMedicine and Public Health, University of Arizona, Tucson,Arizona Introduction American Indians face persistent and pervasive disparities in medical care. Despite significant advances in health care delivery, life expectancy remains four years lower for NativeAmericans than the general population, and the infantmortality is 25 percent higher. 1The causes for these disparities are complex, but an important contributor remains poor accessto care. Natives continue to face cultural and socioeconomicbarriers that limit use of Indian Health Service facilities. Skepticism about Western medicine has been frequently identified as a contributor to these barriers. Natives have hadan ambivalent, and sometimes even adversarial, relationshipwith US government physicians. Many tribes have soughtindependence from the federal system through the IndianHealth and Education Act of 1975. Giving the tribes controlover their own health care has the potential to create a systemmore responsive to local needs. Y et even as tribes have sought increased independence in governing their own medical delivery, there remains apersistent dearth of Native American health care providers totake the helm of local health initiatives. While AmericanIndians constitute 1.5 percent of the US population, 2they are dramatically underrepresented in the professional schools.Only 0.007 percent of medical school graduates are NativeAmerican. 2For other health professional schools, AI students make up only 0.5 to 1 percent of the student body. Thesenumbers have been static over the past 10 years. 4While Native Americans have seen improvement in secondary schoolsuccess with a rise in high school graduation rates from 52 percent in 1980 to 71 percent in 2002, these gains have not beenmatched in graduate education. 5 In this Issue... 81 Increasing the Native American Presence in Health Care: Three Indian Health Service Programs that Support Academic Achievement 86 Promoting Healthy Food Choices among Children in an Isolated First Nations Community 90 Executive Leadership Development Program 91 OB/GYN Chief Clinical Consultant's Corner Digest98 IHS Child Health Notes 100 NCME Videotapes Available 102 Clinical Reporting System (CRS) Update103 Meetings of Interest107 Position VacanciesEducational achievement among Navajo Americans reflects these national trends. Data taken from the 2000 Census reveal that only 62.5 percent of Navajo Americansreport completing high school or the equivalent, as comparedto the national rate of 80 percent. Only 6.9 percent of Navajocomplete at least a four-year college degree, as compared to24.4 percent nationally. While 27.7 percent of Navajo begincollege, only 6.5 percent of the total population achieve a two-year degree, 5 percent obtain a four-year degree, and 1.9percent of Navajo earn a graduate degree. Our Native American students face unique challenges in higher education. Y et they must succeed in order to take on alarger role in health care delivery. We describe three programsthat offer enrichment services to encourage American Indianstudents to pursue careers in the health professions. Adventuresin Medicine, a summer mentorship program at the KayentaHealth Center on the Navajo Nation is currently in its fifth year.The Indigenous Pride Health Career Program, a program on theHopi Nation is currently entering its second year. Both programshave received financial and organizational support from theNorthern Arizona Health Education Center. Pathways intoHealth, a national distance education collaborative, has alsopartnered with Northern Arizona Health Education Center in itsdevelopment and growth. Background AI students are often less successful than other minorities in higher education. Dr. Yvette Roubideaux is a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and a physician working at the Universityof Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. She is the Director of theUniversity of Arizona/Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona Indiansinto Medicine (INMED) Program. In an interview for thisarticle, she cited a very high attrition rate for Native Americanstudents in college. She said, \"The dropout rate is shockinglyhigh - 80 or 90 percent.\" She discovered that the average gradepoint average for first-year Native American students at the Uof A is 1.7. \"They are only able to recover on average to a 2.3or 2.5 by their junior year. That' s at the very lower limit ofpossibility to qualify for graduate school,\" she said. Dr. Thomas Sequist, a member of the Taos Pueblo Tribe in New Mexico, now runs the Four Directions Summer ResearchProgram for Native American college students throughHarvard Medical School. According to Sequist, the fear offailure prevents many students from even entering college.\"One major obstacle is that students haven't considered thatthey could go to college or medical school. I am concernedthat students are too worried that they will fail,\" he said. Sequist looks to the lack of Native American role models as an important barrier to obtaining higher education. Sequisttook a circuitous route to becoming a physician. He completedan undergraduate degree in engineering and worked as anintern for several summers before deciding to pursue medicalschool. \"I'm the first person in my family to finish anundergraduate degree, let alone medical school. My ownbiggest challenge was the lack of physician role models. Inretrospect, I went through the process blindly. I am gratefulthat it turned out so well in the end,\" he said. Sequist cites his mother, who worked as a nurse for the Santa Fe Indian Health Service hospital, as an inspiration.Nursing has traditionally been an accepted role for NativeAmerican professionals in the Indian Health Service. Y et, heworries that without many physician role models, NativeAmerican students choose other health careers because theydon't see a degree in medicine as a feasible option. Heconsiders career counseling one of the most important aspectsof his work with Native American college students. \"It takes alot of work to convince kids that they can be a doctor. If theyhave examined the careers and prefer nursing, then that' s great;we certainly need more Native American nurses. But I worrythat a lot of kids choose careers without considering all of theiroptions,\" he said. In addition to the lack of role models in the community, Roubideaux feels that limited parental education and supportpresent additional challenges. \"I actually see a difference instudents who have a parent who went to college, although I donot have data to prove this. Those students tend to do better.The importance of a college education has been instilled inthem. A parent who has been to college tends to know moreabout how to support a student in college,\" she said. Roubideaux feels that students who graduate from reservation schools struggle the most. \"I think I see the biggestbarriers for students from the reservation schools. Even if theywere a straight-A student, they are way behind the otherstudents once they get to college. They didn't have to work thathard in high school. As a result, they don't have the studyhabits. They don't have the time management skills. A lot ofour students get discouraged during the first year because theyaren't doing as well as they did in high school,\" she said. The cultural barriers cannot be minimized. \"In the environment that most of our students come from, college isnot part of the cultural norm,\" Sequist said. Roubideauxagrees. \"Students are afraid that if they go to college ormedical school and become part of Western thinking, they haveto give up their culture and their families. When students go tocollege, they think they are losing something or must give uptheir culture, which is not at all necessary,\" she said. James Galloway, MD, the founder of the Pathways into Health Program, cited this fear of cultural loss as a primarymotivation for creating a distance-learning program. Inaddition to his responsibilities for the Pathways into HealthProgram, Galloway is also the senior cardiologist and directorfor the Native American Cardiology Program at the Universityof Arizona. Galloway began his career as an internist for theIHS at Hopi, then at the Whiteriver Apache and San CarlosApache hospitals. \"Currently, students who want to pursuehigher education must leave the reservation. They are forcedout of their environment, yet they still have a strong pull toreturn home for family events like ceremonies and funerals. April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 82They fall behind and then cannot graduate. It would be a tremendous opportunity to stay on the reservation and get aneducation at the same time,\" he said. Karen Francis-Begay, originally from Chinle on the Navajo Nation, is now the director of Native American StudentAffairs at the University of Arizona. She created the First Y earScholars Program to recreate in a university setting the familyand clan supports of a home community. She also wanted tocombat the stereotype of the Native American student asdisconnected, ill-prepared, and disadvantaged. The First Y earScholars Program creates a living-learning community gearedfor Native American students. It pulls together previouslyexisting enrichment services into a more cohesive program.Students participating in the program live together in a co-eddorm with an on-site Native American student resident advisor.In addition, the students take courses together, some gearedspecifically for Native American students, and others that aregeneral courses required for graduation. In this way, studentsare able to support each other emotionally and academically.The students are also required to take a Connections Class,taught by Francis-Begay, that reinforces time management andstudy skills. Finally, the program includes mandatory studysessions in the residential dormitory. Francis-Begay sees financial support as an essential component of keeping Native American students in school. Inaddition to providing information on the financial resourcesavailable, the First Y ear Scholars Program also offers a $1000stipend to each student to cover deposits and other costsincurred before the academic term begins, and for manystudents, before other scholarship funds become available. The First Y ear Scholars Program has seen some early success. Last year, a cohort of 30 students participated in thefirst year of the program. \"Attrition was 40 percent for first-time, full-time Native American students after the freshmanyear. In the first year, we need to give the skills to progress tothe second, third, fourth years, and ultimately to graduation. Inour First Y ear Scholars Program, we have had the highestpersistence rate - 69 percent. Hopefully that will translate intoa higher graduation rate as well,\" Francis-Begay said. Francis-Begay plans to expand the program each year until it reaches amaximum of 60 participants. Those students participating in the First Y ear Scholar Program who dropped out cited financial hardship or familyconcerns as the most common reasons for leaving. \"We do exitinterviews with all the students. A lot of students attributedleaving to family issues and financial reasons. Some didn't getthe aid that they expected. For some, the primary incomeprovider lost his or her job; others had family stresses like adeath in the family. A few said that they just weren't quiteready for college,\" she said. Jennifer Stanley completed the First Y ear Scholars Program and is now a sophomore at the University of Arizona.She also participated in Adventures in Medicine in Kayentawhile still in high school. She states that her biggest challengein the transition from high school to college was \"probablytaking my own responsibility for myself, grades-wise, andgoing to my classes. I guess this is all about myself - I'm notdoing it for anyone else but myself.\" She said that before she got to college, it was hard for her to imagine university life. She said about the Kayentamentorship program, \"I didn't know what college was like. Thestudents there were trying to tell us, but I couldn't imagine it.I think they did everything they could to help us, but it was justme.\" Stanley has found the Native American program at the Uof A to be very helpful. \"All the other students there are in thesame boat as me,\" she said. Marquita Mose also participated in Adventures in Medicine and graduated from Monument Valley High Schoolin 2003. She enrolled in Scottsdale Community College andintended to get a degree to be an Emergency MedicalTechnician. But she struggled during her first year of collegeand ultimately withdrew. \"Probably the biggest thing[contributing to my withdrawal] was grades. Y ou had to takethe same classes every day. Doing the work was hard, andfinally I got sick of it. The language and terminology was thehardest,\" she said. She has recently returned to school and iscurrently enrolled in a program to become a nursing assistant. Roubideaux has been impressed by the tremendous barriers facing Native American students in graduate education.\"Initially I focused on the students ready to apply for medicalcareers. Then, I realized we were too late. The first year is thetime people drop out. They get overwhelmed. [A mentor ofmine] believes that you need to help people as early as possiblein the pipeline,\" she said. Galloway concurs. \"Whenever wepresent the Pathways program to the tribal governments, theysay, 'Great, but we need to start earlier!\" he said. Adventures in Medicine, Navajo Nation Adventures in Medicine (AIM) is a peer mentorship program at the Kayenta Health Center in Kayenta, Arizona on the Navajo Nation. Now in its fifth year, the program runs forfour weeks during July. We have mentored 82 high schoolstudents through the program. In addition, we have had 16mentors participate, four of them Native American. The Northern Arizona Health Education Center, which focuses on increasing the number of rural health careproviders, has sponsored the grant of approximately $5,000 peryear. A local organization, Y outh Empowerment Services,administers the grant. Our Health Promotion/DiseasePrevention program also contributes to AIM. The funds pay forstipends for all participants in the program. In addition topaying the mentors, we also offer a $100 stipend to each highschool student who completes the program to reinforce thevalue of the time they spend with us. We also pay honoraria tospeakers, including traditional practitioners and patients whoshare their experiences with illness with the group. Each year, we invite two first-year medical students to run the daily activities and mentor the high school students. Most April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 83years we are able to recruit a local college student to serve as a mentor in addition to the medical students. The program runsthree days per week and is broken into morning didactics andafternoon activities. The day begins with a one-hour lesson taught by the medical students on basic human physiology. The collegestudents teach a college preparation curriculum in which theydiscuss the college application process, the financial aidprocess, and the mentors' personal experiences. They alsoteach how to write a personal statement and a CV , andinterview skills. The college students and medical studentsjointly teach a \"medicine in literature\" curriculum to enhanceliteracy skills. In the afternoons, the students participate infield trips to local health care sites, such as the dialysis center;complete a community service project to improve healthawareness in the community; and volunteer in the clinic. Inaddition to these classes, we invite a patient once weekly toshare his or her experience with illness and the medical system,and we invite various clinic staff to teach the students abouthealth careers. For the past three years, we have also run a \"graduates program\" for students participating in the program for a secondor third summer. These students, generally a group of 4 - 6,receive intensive seminars on topics chosen by the mentors.They also complete their own community service project. We incorporate a traditional Navajo medicine curriculum into our program. We invite a local practitioner to teach thestudents one session per week. Our most exciting field trip thisyear was a joint adventure with the Navajo and Hopi students.They met at the Navajo National Monument and walked thetrails with a Hopi and a Navajo herbalist to study the localplants. Last year, we also initiated an \"Elders Curriculum\"where we invited three traditional elders to teach the studentsabout important issues. Indigenous Pride Health Careers Program, Hopi Nation The Indigenous Pride Health Careers Program (IPHCP) is an intensive program that introduces minority students living on the Hopi Reservation to careers in the health professions. Italso strives to promote healthy lifestyles through education.The program began in summer 2005 with a $107,000 Pathwaysgrant from Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA). The grant was written by the Northern Arizona AreaHealth Education Center (NAHEC) in Flagstaff, Arizona, whoco-facilitates the program along with Hopi Health Care Center,Northland Pioneer College, and other community programsbased on the Hopi Reservation. The primary goal of the IPHCP is to promote a long-term interest in the health professions that will lead to a career inmedicine. Ideally, after receiving an education, the studentswill return to the Hopi Reservation to bring their skills home totheir own community. The IPHCP also trains students to work as youth advocates for healthier lifestyles in the Hopi community. Studentsparticipate in and earn 15.5 college level credits in Introductionto Community Health, Community Health Field Work, FirstAid and CPR, Medical Terminology, and Introduction to SocialWork. In addition to the classroom work, the studentsparticipate in an intensive eight-week summer program thatteaches peer-education skills. Finally, they receive pre-professional training through volunteer opportunities at HopiHealth Care Center under the guidance of physicians and otherhealth care professionals. Upon completion of the program,students receive Community Health Advisor certificationthrough Northland Pioneer College. This program has recently concluded the first nine-month cycle. Ten IPHC students began in the summer of 2005 with aretreat at Northern Arizona University (NAU) to learnleadership skills. This two-day retreat was coordinated byNAHEC staff in Flagstaff. Students bonded through variousactivities including an all-day ropes course teambuildingexercise and hands-on workshops dealing with leadershipissues. Immediately after the conclusion of the leadership retreat, the students began their first classes: Introduction toCommunity Health and Red Cross First Aid/CPR training.They also attended a weekend orientation and health fair at theUniversity of Arizona, hosted a group of summer campstudents on a tour of the Hopi Reservation, and spent two daysin Kayenta with students from the Adventures in Medicineprogram. For the majority of students, the stand-out experiencewas \"shadowing\" health care professionals at Hopi Health Careand various community-based organizations. IPHCP wrapped up the summer with Community Health Field Work, a class that prepares students to conduct variouscommunity projects. The culminating assignment for the classis conducting an actual project within their community. Thisyear' s projects included community cooking demonstrations, asubstance abuse video, an injury prevention program, and a\"Stop the Pop\" campaign. Some of the students were able toadvertise their programs on local radio, which taught them howto create effective promotion materials. Students were challenged as they headed back to begin the 2005 - 2006 school year. Not only did they attend school full-time and participate in school sports programs and other extra-curricular activities, but they also attended IPHCP collegecourses in the evening. The students completed a class insocial work in the fall, and are currently completing theircoursework requirements with a course in medicalterminology. Students also participated in a three-dayconference in February in Scottsdale, Arizona entitled\"Healthy Adolescents: Building the Future,\" sponsored by theArizona Adolescent Health Coalition, which exposed studentsto health issues confronting today' s youth. This has been an exciting year for both students and everyone coordinating IPHCP behind the scenes. Introducingstudents to new challenges and helping them realize that theycan succeed in college and pursue any career they choose has April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 84been a priceless experience. We will need to see several years of graduates before we can begin to assess the effectiveness ofthis program. This year, we anticipate introducing another 10- 12 students to this program. Pathways into Health, A National Program Pathways Into Health is a unique national educational partnership between academic institutions, the Indian Health Service, and Native American tribes, communities and tribalcolleges to bring graduate education to remote reservationtowns via distance learning technology. The program currentlyinvolves over 140 individuals in ten university institutions, andmultiple tribes and Indian organizations, tribal colleges, andthe Indian Health Service, as well as other federal and non-profit organizations. A resolution of support from the NationalCongress of American Indians and a National AdvisoryCouncil composed of outstanding American Indianacademicians offer guidance and support in this importantinitiative. This program, now in its second year, strives to bring university academics to Indian communities utilizing the latestin telehealth and distance learning technology. Local healthfacilities then partner with the academic institutions to providepractical learning opportunities. Native American studentsmatriculate and graduate in their home towns and can thenremain in their hometowns as they pursue careers in their localhealth care facilities. The program, currently piloting acurriculum for laboratory technicians to become technologists,will be expanding to include training for physicians, nurses,pharmacists, psychologists, physical therapists, dentalhygienists, public health experts, and other health professions. A major component of the Pathways into Health Program is the Pipeline Committee, co-chaired by the Assistant Provostat Nothern Arizona University, Dr. Carl Fox, and SeanClendaniel of the Northern Arizona AHEC Program. Thiscommittee is focusing on the development of nationalcollaborations and coordination of activities related toacademic support and interventions for youth fromkindergarten through high school. Conclusion Increasing the number of Native American health care professionals is an important component of efforts to improve access of Native Americans to high-quality health care. WhileNative American students have made strides in secondaryeducation, these achievements have yet to translate intosufficient numbers of Native American health careprofessionals, particularly physicians. The solution to thiscomplex problem remains elusive, but clearly interventions arerequired at all stages of education. IHS health care providersare uniquely positioned to mentor local youth, to guide themthrough the educational process, and to empower them tobecome successful health professionals ready to direct thefuture of medical care for Native Americans.

April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 85April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 86Promoting Healthy Food Choices among Children in an Isolated First Nations Community Peter Louie, MD, Tara Tandan, MD, FRCPC, Rod Rassekh, MD, Benton, LLB, all the Departmentof Pediatrics; and Andrew Macnab, MD, FRCPC, formerlyfrom the Department of Pediatrics, now Distinguished Scholarin Residence, Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies,University of British Columbia, V ancouver, British Columbia The Need Nutritional health among First Nations children, particularly those living in remote areas, is poorer than among children living in urban settings. 1-4The increasing prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in FirstNations populations suggests the need for early, moreaggressive health promotion interventions. 1-13Dental health is also known to be below the average for the remainder of thepopulation, and poor nutrition is known to be both a cause andconsequence of poor dental health. 14 Intervention programs aimed at achieving healthier diets for school-aged children have the potential to positivelyinfluence dietary habits throughout life and contribute to theprevention of chronic disease. Such programs are frequentlyfocused on nutritional education alone, and previous studieshave shown that this is insufficient to change food choices andhabits. 1,16-20Food preference has been shown to be an important factor in determining food choices, and when these preferencesare established in childhood, they tend to be maintained intoadulthood. 1,16-22Food availability may also play a role. To design effective and culturally consistent interventions, wemust first understand the nutritional status of isolated FirstNations communities. The purpose of this study was to gather data on nutritional knowledge, practices, and status, as part of the development ofan intervention program to improve the nutritional health ofchildren in Hartley Bay, a remote Tsimshian First Nationscommunity in northern British Columbia. Methods Participants. Hartley bay is an isolated First Nations village in Northern British Columbia. The closest town, Prince Rupert, is 135 kilometers north and accessed by a one-hourflight or seven-hour ferry ride. In this community, there are250 people, 70 of whom are children. All 53 school-agedchildren, ranging from preschool to the eleventh grade (age 5 -18 years), and their 28 primary caregivers (who prepared themajority of the children' s meals) were invited to participate.Informed consent was obtained from parents of 52 (98%) ofthe children. The study had the approval of the University ofBritish Columbia Behavioral Review Board. Materials. Food intake data were collected using a three- day food diary. To enhance diary completion, the survey wasconducted during school days. The diaries includedinstructions on how to report both the type and quantity ofdifferent foods. Nutritional knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, andpreferences were assessed using questionnaires. Thequestionnaires were designed and the language modified by amember of the community to ensure that it was appropriate,understandable, and culturally-sensitive. The questionnaireswere then pilot tested with a sample of parents and children inthe community, and their suggestions incorporated. Procedures. The children' s questionnaire was administered by teachers at the school to students in or abovethe third grade. Teachers had children in third grade or abovecompleted breakfast, lunch, and daytime snacks portions of thefood diary during class time, and assigned dinner and night-time snacks to be completed as homework assignments. Pointswere awarded for the completion of each day' s diary, and asmall prize awarded to each student for completion of thethree-day diary. For children in grade two or below, the threeday food diary was completed both at home and at school, withthe help of the parents for breakfast, dinner and eveningsnacks, and the teachers for lunch and daytime snacks. Amember of the research team visited each of the fourclassrooms on a daily basis to answer questions regarding fooddiary completion and to facilitate legible and detailedrecording of dietary intake. The caregiver' s questionnaires were administered to the primary caregiver for each child during the weekly home visitmade by the Community Health Representative. Outcome Measures and Analysis. The primary outcome measure was the average daily nutrient intake for the childrenstudied. In recent years, scientists from Canada and the Instituteof Medicine, Food and Nutrition in the United States havedeveloped a harmonized set of nutritional recommendationsknown as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). 21-27DRIs are slowly replacing the 1990 Canadian RNIs (recommended nutrientintakes). This transition is not yet complete and both systemsare being used. It has generally been accepted that althoughmicronutrient values are referenced using DRIs, formacronutrients, RNIs are still being used. Secondary analysesof current nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs ofcaregiver and/or child, and their relationships to actual foodintake of the study children were performed. Statistical Analysis. Children' s and caregiver' s questionnaire responses were manually graded, transcribed onto a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and descriptive statisticscalculated. Nutrient intake was derived from the diaries by aqualified dietary technician who entered the food diaries intothe dietary analysis software used at British Columbia' sChildren' s (CBORD Professional DietAnalyzer/Spreadsheet V4.2.02 ). Total daily nutrient intakes derived from the diaries were then averaged for each age rangethat correlated with reference values.Results Of 53 school aged children, 52 (98%) consented to participate in the study, male:female ratio 1:1.27, age 4 to 18 years.We received 43 (83%) completed Food Diaries and 42 (81%)completed Children' s Questionnaires. From the 28 households, wereceived 21 (75%) completed Caregiver Questionnaires. Children' s Food Diaries. Children' s average daily macronutrient intakes calculated from the diary records aresummarized in Table 1. Among the children in our study, 25% ofcalories were from fat, 13% from protein, and 62% fromcarbohydrate. All age groups in both sexes fell below therecommended nutritional intake(RNI) for daily caloric intake. April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 87Table 1.

Child food preferences, with food scored from1 (dislike) to 4 (love)9-11 12-14 15-1718-2021-23 Children' s Questionnaires. During the study period, most meals were prepared by a parent for 31 (74%), by asibling for 4 (10%), by themselves for 5 (12%) and byanother person (aunt, grandmother, other) for 6 (14 %) ofthe children. The children were asked to choose allsources from which they received their nutritionknowledge. Twenty-eight (67%) children reportedlearning about nutrition from parents, 27 (64%) fromhealth care workers, 25 (60%) at school, 25 (60%) fromelders, and 16 (38%) through media. Children recordedthe highest preference (1 = hate, 2 = don't mind, 3 = like,4 = love) for fruits, followed by milk, sweets, meat andfish, chips, vegetables, and noodles in descending order ofpreference (Table 2).Caregiver Questionnaire. The average number of dependents for the 21 caregivers who completed the caregiver questionnaires was 2.2. The caregivers reported that themajority of meals are prepared by a parent (18; 86%).Occasionally meals are prepared by other family membersincluding siblings (3; 14%), a grandparent or a (4; 19%). Fifteen caregivers(71.4%) identified elders, 11 (52%) identified health careworkers, and 8 (38%) identified the media as a source of theirnutrition knowledge. Taste was reported as being the mostimportant determinant of food choice. Caregivers recorded highest preference scores (1 = dislike, 2 = don't mind, 3 = like, 4 = love) to fruits, and meat and fish,followed by vegetables, grains, milk, and then sweets. Sweetsreceived the lowest ranking, with a mean score of 2.6 (Table 3).Caregivers' comments on constraints influencing food choiceincluded \"unhealthier foods are cheaper to buy,\"\"transportation is an added cost,\" \"short life span for produce,\"\"no local produce access,\" \"meats, vegetables, and fruits arecostly,\" \"not much locally available except junk food,\" \"limitedaccess to vegetables and fruits,\" \"hard to get vegetables andfruits into Hartley Bay,\" \"eat seafood while in season and whilefreezer supply lasts,\" \"seafood not as plenty as before.\" April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 88Table 3. Caregiver food preferences, with food scored from 1 (dislike) to 4 (love) Table 4. Food caregivers would eat more of if available(n=21) When asked w hich foods they would eat more of if they had the chance, caregivers reported fruits (100%), vegetables (95%) and dairy (95%) as their foods of choice (table 4). Someof their comments regarding specific food examples andfactors preventing their consumption of more of these foodswere, \"cereals, w hite and wheat bread: availability,\" \"all kinds of fruits and having to wait for the ferry to run - too expensiveon the seaplane at $0.60 per pound,\" \"limited availability andno local grocery store.\" With regard to dairy products theycommented that \"if they buy too much, the products spoil.\" When asked what ideas they could suggest to help make fresh goods and dairy more available in the community, 3(14%) did not respond, 3 (14%) suggested improved regularferry transport or regular ferry visits with supplies for salefrom the ferry, 2 (10%) suggested improved regular planetransport, 14 (67 %) suggested a community store, and 1 (5%)suggested some healthy food supply support through theschool. Additional suggestions made were for healthy cookingclasses and monthly healthy food packages for set incomeclients. Specific comments included, \"the band can have theirown small grocery store, owned by the village, not by just a fewpeople,\" \"we desperately need a grocery store,\" and \"ferry oncea week or every two weeks to sell fruit, veggies, meats andother foods other than pop, chips, bars and sweets.\" Discussion The daily caloric intake of the children of Hartley Bay was inadequate, although the percentage of calories from fats, carbohydrates and proteins were in the normal range.Nutritional analysis showed inadequate calcium, vitamin D,fiber, and folate intake. Vitamin C consumption was above thenormal range primarily due to over-consumption of sweetenedjuice mixes. Nutritional knowledge for these children camealmost equally from school, health care workers, and familymembers. Caregivers identified elders as the primary source offood knowledge. Previous nutritional studies have shown that education is important; however, when used alone, it is insufficient tochange food choice and eating habits. Food preference hasbeen shown to be much more strongly correlated withconsumption than is knowledge. 1,15,19-22Children may know which foods are healthy, but likely will not consume themunless they find them desirable to eat. The Pathways studyamong American Indian communities found that a multi-faceted approach could be effective in changing nutritionknowledge and diet. 28 In our study, taste was the main determinant of food choice in children, with their highest food preference beingfruits, followed by milk and sweets. Taste was the also theprimary determinant of food choice in caregivers with theirhighest food preference being fruits and meats, followed bygrain and vegetables. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and diaryproducts are the foods that they would eat more of if given theopportunity. Lack of availability of fresh produce and dairyproducts due to transportation costs and perishability causedthe greatest constraint on food choice. The limitation inavailability of these foods is reflected in inadequate calcium,vitamin D, fiber, and folate intake found in the dietary analysis.The daily caloric intake was inadequate although the percentage of calories from fats, carbohydrates, and proteinswas in the normal range. Vitamin C consumption was abovethe normal range primarily due to over-consumption ofsweetened juice mixes. The primary barrier to healthier food choices in this remote community is the availability of fresh fruits, vegetables,and diary products. We have identified that they have a desireto consume these foods if they were available. Solutions The caregivers suggested a general store, but on discussion with the band, this was not seen as a feasible option, as the store would face pressures to provide credit or loans tocustomers who wanted to pay at a later date, but who would beunreliable about paying. The possibility of a store on the ferry,which comes twice a week, may be a feasible solution, whichwill be explored further by the community. Vitaminsupplementation was considered, but this was considered notpractical or sustainable. Folate supplementation, to decreasethe incidence of neural tube defects in the neonate, will berecommended for females in their teens or those who plan toconceive. Most importantly, based on the findings of this study, and with guidance from the community health director, a \"SMARTmeals\" program has been developed by a member of thevillage. SMART stands for: Swift to prepare, Money wise,Appropriate for the family, Remarkably delicious, Totallyhealthy. The SMART program has been piloted, and theresponse by the community has been excellent. In thebeginning phase of implementation, the participants attendfour sessions that focus on breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snackspreparation. These sessions teach menu planning, creativerecipes, economical shopping, along with food preservationand storage techniques. The sessions are meant to beinteractive, and community members are encouraged to sharetechniques and tips amongst one another. The \"SMARTMeals\" program has since been expanded to include foodoptions for feasts, which are socially and culturally importantcomponents of life in First Nations communities. In response,twenty-seven menu items have been developed to preserve thetraditions held for generations by First Nations communities,while moving forward to improve the health and well being ofits residents. The above findings need to be considered in light of the study limitations. These data were based on self reporting anddepend on the children' s memories to recall and describe whatthey consumed. The data from the food diaries only reflectedweekday food intake and not weekend consumption. Finally,the small sample size may also limit the generalizability of thedata. However, the challenges of access to fresh foods arelikely similar amongst most isolated northern British Columbiacommunities, and solutions found for this community may beappropriate for others. This work was only possible because of the motivation of the Gitga'at Band Council to improve the health of theirchildren, which led to the collaborative relationship betweenthe community and the authors.

OB/GYN Chief Clinical Consultant's Corner Digest Abstract of the Month Tired of hearing only bad news from the WHI? Reductionin diabetes incidence with combination hormonereplacement Aims/Hypothesis: Studies examining the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy on concentrations of glucose, insulin, and diabetes incidence have beeninconclusive, in part because many of the studies were toosmall. We examined the effect of oestrogen plus progestin ondiabetes incidence and insulin resistance. Methods: The study was a randomised, double-blind trial comparing the effect of daily 0.625 mg conjugated equineoestrogens (CEE) plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetatewith that of placebo during 5.6 years of follow-up. Theparticipants were 15,641 postmenopausal women enrolled inthe Women' s Health Initiative Hormone Trial. These womenwere aged 50 to 79 and all had an intact uterus. Diabetesincidence was ascertained by self-report of treatment withinsulin or oral hypoglycaemic medication. Fasting glucose,insulin, and lipoproteins were measured in a random sample atbaseline and at 1 and 3 years. Results: The cumulative incidence of treated diabetes was 3.5% in the hormone therapy group and 4.2% in the placebogroup (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.67-0.93, p = 0.004). Therewas little change in the hazard ratio after adjustment forchanges in BMI and waist circumference. During the first yearof follow-up, changes in fasting glucose and insulin indicateda significant fall in insulin resistance in actively treated womencompared to the control subjects (Y ear 1 to baseline between-group difference -0.22+/-0.10, p = 0.03). Conclusion: These data suggest that combined therapy with oestrogen and progestin reduces the incidence of diabetes,possibly mediated by a decrease in insulin resistance unrelatedto body size. Future studies of alternative postmenopausalhormone therapy regimens and selective oestrogen agonistsand/or antagonists should consider the effects of theseregimens on insulin resistance and diabetes. Margolis KL, et al. Effect of oestrogen plus progestin on the incidence of diabetes in postmenopausal women: resultsfrom the Women' s Health Initiative Hormone Trial.Diabetologia. 2004 Jul;47(7):1175-87.Comment: Thomas Burke, Anchorage Does hormone replacement prevent type II diabetes? The question has been raised by several small observational studies with conflicting results. Now we havethree large studies that show a significant decrease in diabetesincidence for women taking estrogen with progesterone. TheNurses Health Study (N=21,028) was prospective andobservational. HERS, the Heart and Estrogen/ProgesteroneReplacement Study (N=2,029), and WHI, the Women' s HealthInitiative (N=15,641), were both large prospective randomizedstudies. All three showed a significant decrease in diabetes incidence of 20% or more. The studies controlled for other risk factors like weight, and the WHI showed a decrease in insulinresistance as well. It is highly unlikely that we will seeadditional studies of this size addressing this issue. Hopefullythe diabetes risk data from the estrogen only arm of the WHIwill be published soon. While public attention his focused onother findings of these studies, the change in diabetesincidence may be of greater clinical significance. As type IIdiabetes is such a common disease in AI/AN, we shouldinclude this information in our counseling. We do not recommend taking hormone replacement for the purpose of disease prevention, even though we know that itis effective at least for osteoporosis, hip fracture, and coloncancer. We know that colon cancer is increased to nearlydouble the prevalence in some AI/AN. Currently it isreasonable to prescribe hormone replacement for the treatmentof menopausal symptoms after a discussion of the risks andbenefits. The decreased incidence of type II diabetes shouldnow become a routine part of that discussion. OB/GYN CCC editorial comment Thanks to Dr. Burke for pointing out a possible bias that appears to overlook the benefits of hormone therapy (HT), while emphasizing the negative effects of HT. Anotherexample is referenced below. In the estrogen alone trial,estrogen decreased coronary heart disease risk among women50 to 59 years of age at baseline. Our goal should be to presentbalanced, non-judgmental counseling to our AI/AN patients. Hsia J, et al. Conjugated equine estrogens and coronary heart disease: The Women' s Health Initiative.

Hot Topics ObstetricsGDM: Can we proceed directly to one stepscreening/diagnosis in AI/AN women? Some providers have noted that many AI/AN patients are lost to follow-up between a positive glucose screen test result and the performance of the definitive diagnostic test, the three-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Other providers note thatmany AI/AN women live in remote areas with limited access tocare, yet have some of the highest rates of diabetes inpregnancy in the US, and possibly in the world. ACOG and the Indian health system convened an expert panel of 35 in April 1993 to discuss these and other issuesrelated to the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus inpregnancy. One of the main areas of discussion was thateliminating the screening phase and proceeding directly to adiagnostic test seemed warranted in certain AI/ANpopulations. There was general concurrence that these rates were so high that being an AI/AN woman was sufficient to serve initself as a positive screen, and thus to indicate the need for adiagnostic level of testing directly. The Expert Panel suggestedthat upcoming Technical Bulletins (subsequently modified to'Practice Bulletins') reflect that other loading doses arecurrently used in other populations. Hence, the current ACOGPractice Bulletin, No. 30 now states, \". . . there may be groupsof individuals at such high risk for GDM that it may be moreconvenient and cost-effective to proceed directly to thediagnostic GTT without obtaining the laboratory screeningtest.\" OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment: After the above ACOG Consultation, the American Diabetes Association issued the following statement: One-step approach: perform a diagnostic OGTT without prior plasma or serum glucose screening. The one-stepapproach may be cost-effective in high-risk patients orpopulations (e.g., some Native American groups). The ACOG Consultation was a high level document, i.e., no direct recommendations came out of the ACOGConsultation - it was ultimately left up to the local facility. Personally, a good rule of thumb is that if any AI/AN groupexceeds 7 %, then they would qualify for one-step testing;hence within the context of the ACOG/ADA advice above, Isuggest any AI/AN group that exceeds a 7% prevalence ofdiabetes in pregnancy should consider one step universaldiabetes screening. This screening should occur at 24 - 28weeks. If additional high risk factors are present, thenadditional screening should also be performed at the firstprenatal visit. High risk patients include those with the following factors: history of infant over 8 lb,14oz. (4000 grams) at birth first degree family history of diabetes (parents or sibling) initial visit BMI > 25 (BMI = kg/m 2X 100) past history stillbirth, congenital anomaly current pregnancy: unexplained polyhydraminos, persistent glycosuria age > 35 years prior history of gestational diabetes Other Resources Gestational Diabetes.

Link between GDM and type 2 DM can be broken: update The similarity of findings between the PIPOD and TRIPOD studies support a class effect of thiazolidinedionedrugs to enhance insulin sensitivity, reduce insulin secretorydemands, and preserve pancreatic beta-cell function, all inassociation with a relatively low rate of type 2 diabetes, inHispanic women with prior gestational diabetes. Xiang AH, et al. Effect of pioglitazone on pancreatic beta- cell function and diabetes risk in Hispanic women with priorgestational diabetes. Diabetes. 2006 Feb;55(2):517-22. OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment The January 2006 CCCC reported that treatment with troglitazone delayed or prevented the onset of type 2 diabetes inprevious GDM patients (Buchanan, et al). Unfortunately,troglitazone was subsequently taken off the market. Xiang, et alnow report a similar effect, which raises the question of a classeffect in the thiazolidinedione drugs. As many as 70% of GDMpatients can progress onto type II DM, especially if they do notreturn to their ideal body weight.

Child Health FDA warns parents about contaminated teething rings The Food and Drug Administration urges parents to stop giving their babies a liquid-filled plastic teething ring made by The First Y ears, a unit of RC2 Corp., which may becontaminated with bacteria. Liquid in the teething rings couldinfect infants if they swallow or absorb it through a cut in themouth, the FDA said. The risk of illness is greatest for babieswith immune systems weakened by cancer, malnutrition, orother health problems. Chronic Illness Prenatal setting represents a missed opportunity fortuberculosis treatment completion Results: Among 678 women with known tuberculin test (TST) status, 341 (50.3%) had a TST -positive result, including 200 who were newly diagnosed. Of 291 TST -positive women with no previous LTBI treatment or history ofTB, 27 (9.3%) completed >6 months of INH. In a subset withdetailed follow-up, the most important reasons for notcompleting treatment were nonreferral for evaluation of a TST -positive result (30.9%), not keeping the appointment (17.9%),and nonadherence with prescribed treatment (34.6%). Conclusion: The prenatal setting represents a missed opportunity to link TST -positive non-US-born women withLTBI treatment and support for treatment completion. Sackoff JE, et al.

Breastfeeding: Suzan Murphy, PIMC Breastfeeding as a pain reliever Most of us can manage the momentary discomfort from minor invasive medical procedures. Just a little pinch for an injection, venopuncture, or finger stick is quickly forgotten asa small price for the knowledge or benefit that the procedureprovides. However, when the \"little pinch\" is happening tonewborns, parents and providers have a bigger struggle.Neonates experience pain, possibly more profoundly than olderbabies. Therefore, finding ways to reduce the level of pain thata newborn experiences from necessary, minor, invasivemedical procedure is important to neonatal care. Traditionally, there have been few options for newborn pain management. Pharmaceutical tools have not beencommonly used due to questionable effectiveness and potentialadverse effects. But with new tools such as sweet solutions,pacifier use, and breastfeeding being explored, there arepossibly new minor pain management options to use. Expanding on work done by L. Gray, et al at Boston University School of Medicine, R. Carbajal, et al at Poissy-Saint Germain Hospital in France explored the effectiveness ofinfant pain relief during a routine, invasive, medical procedure.One hundred and eighty term, well infants were divided intofour groups of 45 infants each, to be monitored during avenopuncture. The variable groups were breastfeeding, beingheld in their mother' s arms (not breastfeeding), receivingsterile water, and receiving 30% glucose followed by a pacifier.During the venopuncture procedure, infants were monitoredfor response to pain using videoed observations of facial, eye,and limb movements, vocal response such crying, and clinicalindicators of heart rate and oxygen saturation. The results wereconsistent with L. Gray, et al' s research of slightly older infants(5 - 7 wks). Breastfeeding was effective in reducing indicatorsof pain response during a common invasive medical procedure.There was no variation in sucking reported by mothers whobreastfed during the venipuncture. This suggests that there wasno negative maternal impact, such as nipple chomping/biting,while the infant experienced the venopuncture. It was notedthat using glucose followed by a pacifier was equally aseffective as breastfeeding. The variables of holding an infantor offering sterile water were not found to effectively reducethe pain response. Breastfeeding during a minor medical procedure could be easily achieved in the clinic environment. It could also easeprocedures, benefiting the staff, patient, and family. Medical Mystery Tour As seen on TV's Desperate Housewives: wandering spleen If you, or any of your family members, happened to inadvertently watch Desperate Housewives on 2/12/06, you might have wondered what a 'wandering spleen' really is. If bychance you happen to have missed just this one particularepisode, one of the characters on the program had recentlybeen diagnosed with a wandering spleen and was trying 'desperately' to get married quickly so she could get healthinsurance. Comments about our health insurance system and the increasing number of uninsured Americans aside (see below),the character related that she was told that her spleen couldcrash into her heart at any time. It has been a month since thatepisode and I presume you have been on the edge of your seatsince then, so here, finally, is the rest of the story. Congenital wandering spleen is a very rare, randomly distributed, birth defect characterized by the absence orweakness of one or more of the ligaments that hold the spleenin its normal position in the upper left abdomen. The disorderis not genetic in origin. Instead of ligaments, the spleen isattached by a stalk-like tissue supplied with blood vessels(vascular pedicle). If the pedicle is twisted in the course of themovement of the spleen, the blood supply may be interruptedor blocked (ischemia) to the point of severe damage to theblood vessels (infarction). Because there is little or nothing tohold it in place the spleen \"wanders\" in the lower abdomen orpelvis where it may be mistaken for an unidentified abdominalmass. Symptoms of wandering spleen are typically those associated with an abnormally large size of the spleen(splenomegaly) or the unusual position of the spleen in theabdomen. Enlargement is most often the result of twisting(torsion) of the splenic arteries and veins or, in some cases, theformation of a blood clot (infarct) in the spleen. \"Acquired\"wandering spleen may occur during adulthood due to injuriesor other underlying conditions that may weaken the ligamentsthat hold the spleen in its normal position (e.g., connectivetissue disease or pregnancy). OB/GYN CCC editorial comment Y es, on the one hand, the character was correct that her spleen may be loosely tethered in its current location, but it would not have 'crashed' into her mediastinum. On the otherhand, another term for this phenomenon is 'pelvic spleen,' sowe should be aware of this as a possible cause of an unknownpelvic mass. Other terms for this phenomenon are: displacedspleen, drifting spleen, floating spleen, splenic ptosis,splenoptosis, and systopic spleen. The wandering spleen syndrome is also a rare cause of acute abdominal pain that is most typically seen in youngeradolescents and children, although it can occur in adults.Patients typically present with acute left upper quadrant painassociated with an abdominal mass. CT imaging confirms thediagnosis. The treatment of choice is splenopexy; splenectomymay be required if the spleen is infarcted and there is torsionand absence of splenic blood flow. Fun facts about wandering spleens aside, the real issue here is the extent to which this character, and many patients inthe US, have to go to get adequate health care. Unfortunately,due to economic factors, there are increasingly more uninsuredpatients. While this may not directly effect our AI/AN patients,it will affect their partners, if their partner is non-Native, andhence our greater tribal family systems. It also hasdownstream Indian health funding effects on AI/ANs as theuninsured patients stress an already stressed Medicaid andMedicare system. As health professionals we should continueto educate our colleagues, the public, and our legislativerepresentatives that health care is an important investment fora productive society. Resource The Uninsured. ACOG Committee Opinion No. 308. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Obstet Gynecol 2004;104:1471-4. This is an insightful document fromthe ACOG Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women. Midwives Corner: Rosemary Bolza, CNM and Marsha L. Tahquechi, CNMShould we to draw rubella titers as part of theprenatal panel? I remember having rubella. It wasn't too bad. We had a trip planned so my mother went ahead and took me on the Greyhound bus. I got to wear dark glasses and thought I waspretty cool. However, my children never had this experiencebecause of the development of vaccinations for rubella andmeasles (rubeola). In my midwifery program in 1981, documenting immunity to rubella was important for both the midwife and the prenatalpatient, even though rubella was very rare at that time. Thedevastating consequences of congenital rubella meant thathealth care providers needed to be sure they were immune andthat pregnant women who were not immune needed to takeprecautions if there were an outbreak of rubella. However, Ibelieve that today the rubella titer gives us a false sense ofsecurity and we would give better care by concentrating ondocumenting and updating immunizations. Several years ago the CDC put out news releases that rubella was not present in the United States. The disease thatis still sometimes seen is the measles (rubeola). In the early90s it became apparent that two MMRs are needed to give goodprotection against the measles. I often see providers who lookonly at the rubella immunity and do not take the time to checkif the patient has had two MMRs. Rubella immunity does notassure immunity to rubeola. Even if a person is rubellanonimmune, if they have had two MMRs there is norecommendation to continue to give more MMRs, so theroutine drawing of the rubella titer is not necessary. The timeand money spent on rubella titers for prenatal patients would bebetter spent documenting and updating all of the recommendedadult immunizations for the prenatal patient. OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment Special thanks to Rosemary Bolza for bringing up this subtle, but important issue. Rosemary' s point goes with a long line of obstetric practices that consume energy, but have no April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 94April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 95'value added'; e.g., there is no role for routine urine dipstick testing in return prenatal visits. Roz Singleton Should all pregnant women have serology screening forrubella and varicella? No. Serologic testing for varicella should be considered only for women who do not have evidence of immunity (reliable history of chickenpox or documented vaccination).Rubella serologic testing is only necessary for women whocannot provide written documentation of rubella vaccination.Once a person has been found to be seropositive, it is notnecessary to test again in the future. If an employee has two documented MMRs but has negative titers for one or more of these diseases, should Igive an additional MMR dose? The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) does not routinely recommend more than two doses of MMR. A negative serology after two documented doses ofMMR probably represents a false negative (i.e., antibody titertoo low to detect with commercial tests). However, it istheoretically possible to have true two-dose vaccine failure. Ifa person is found to have a negative serology after twodocumented doses of MMR, it may be prudent to administerone additional dose of MMR. Y ou should also cease doingpostvaccination serologic testing if an employee has twodocumented doses of MMR, which is the ACIP definition of\"immune.\" Acceptable documentation of immunity for rubella in childbearing women include: documentation of one dose ofMMR (or other rubella containing vaccine) or lab evidence ofimmunity. However, measles immunity requires two doses ofMMR. I agree with you that it is important to ensureimmunity to both measles and rubella; titers could preventsomeone from getting a second dose of MMR. The secondMMR right now is only required in school-aged children, somecolleges, and in hospital care workers, so it' s not universal, butit' s a good idea Do birth certificate data reflect the number of CNM- attended births? The number of midwife attended births has been steadily increasing since the 1970s. This growth has been primarily attributed to the growth in the CNM population. In 2002, 8.1%of all births were attended by a midwife. Still, despite theincrease, there is evidence that midwife attended births areunder-reported. This small study at a Michigan practice fromJune to August 1999 reviewed 899 births for accuracy inreporting birth data. Conclusions: There was an over-reporting of CNM attended births at the hospital level. However the state vitalstatistics records showed a 10.9% under-reporting of CNMattended births. The under-reporting of CNM attended births,while unclear in origin, has been attributable to a variety ofpossible errors. Recommendations were made to improve theaccuracy in the reporting of CNM attended births. CNMs areencouraged to learn about the birth registration process at thelocal, state, and federal levels to ensure accuracy in reportingCNM attended births. Walker DS, et al. Do birth certificate data accurately reflect the number of CNM-attended births? yet another to protectnon-pregnant non-immune women against chickenpox Inevitably, at 5pm on Friday, the patient says, \"I'm pregnant, my four-year-old has chicken pox, and my mother says that I never had it when I was a child. Should I be worried?\" Thankfully, with increasing use of varicella vaccine in children and non-immune adults, this scenario is becomingmuch less common. But varicella exposure of non-immunepregnant women still occurs and is now more challenging tomanage since the company that manufactured varicella zosterimmune globulin (VZIG) has recently discontinuedproduction. Varicella zoster virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets and close contact, and is highly contagious, with 60-90% ofsusceptible people becoming infected after contact. The periodof infectivity is from 48 hours before the rash appears until thelast vesicles crust over. The incubation period is from 10 to 20days (average 14 days). Infection with varicella confers life-long immunity. Because of the high prevalence of immunity inadults, varicella infection in pregnancy is quite rare. Althoughthe disease course is often mild in children, affected adults maybecome gravely ill, with complications including pneumoniaand encephalitis. If acquired in the first 20 weeks ofpregnancy, there is a small (<2%) risk that the fetus willdevelop congenital varicella syndrome. Infection around thetime of delivery is also especially risky for the neonate; if amother develops chicken pox from five days before until twodays after giving birth, the neonate will lack protectivematernal antibodies and is especially at risk. If a pregnant woman describes a recent possible exposure to varicella, careful questioning will usually elicit a history ofchickenpox infection in the past. Of women who do not recalla history of chickenpox, 70-90% will still have detectableantibodies. If antibody testing is available in a timely manner,this will often confirm that no further intervention is needed.If antibody testing is unavailable or indicates that the patient issusceptible to varicella, then administration of VZIG within 72hours of exposure is recommended. With VZIG now unavailable, the CDC has recommended consideration of the use of VariZIG, which is only availableunder an \"Investigational New Drug Application ExpandedAccess Protocol\" from a sole U.S. distributor. VariZIG is apurified human immune globulin preparation prepared from plasma with high levels of anti-varicella antibodies. It is verysimilar to VZIG but is lyophilized. Because it is only availableunder IND protocols, informed consent must be obtained priorto use. ACIP has recommended that the following groups ofnon-immune exposed patients receive VariZIG: Immunocompromised patients. Pregnant women. Neonates whose mothers have signs and symptoms of varicella infection from five days before to two daysafter delivery. Premature infants born at >28 weeks gestation and exposed in the neonatal period, whose mothers arenon-immune. Premature infants born at <28 weeks (or <1000g) and exposed in the neonatal period, regardless of maternalimmune status Treatment should be given as soon as possible; efficacy more than 96 hours after exposure is unknown. If VariZIGcannot be obtained, administration of intravenous immuneglobulin may be considered. If no treatment is undertaken,close observation and early treatment with acyclovir for anyresulting infection is indicated. Post-exposure prophylaxis forthose not included in the above high risk groups can beaccomplished with prompt varicella vaccination. ACOG recommends vaccination of nonpregnant women of childbearing age if no history of previous chickenpoxinfection is elicited. The loss of ready access to VZIG onlyincreases the utility of this intervention. Procuring VariZIG ina timely manner is likely to be difficult for even large urbanfacilities; getting post-exposure prophylaxis to a womanseeking care at a rural site such as those served by many IndianHealth Service facilities will be especially challenging.

OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment Dr. Howe raises an excellent point. Here are a few additional thoughts. As chickenpox is becoming relatively lessfrequent, one would have to vaccinate a relatively largernumber of women to prevent one perinatal case. Moreover,many women without a history of chickenpox will haveantibodies from non-clinical infection, so we should screen forvaricella antibody titers in all women without a history ofchicken pox before immunizing them. Finally, as we don'twant to vaccinate pregnant women, we should performantibody testing when possible. Oklahoma Perspective from Greggory Woitte, Hastings Indian Medical CenterMetformin and polycystic ovarian syndrome Polycystic ovarian syndrome is present in approximately 5 - 7% of women and is defined as hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. Women with PCOS have an 11-foldincreased risk in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.Metformin combined with clomiphene citrate increases thelikelihood of successful ovulation and pregnancy rates.Metformin has been shown to decrease insulin resistance andcause weight loss in obese women. Metformin for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (Barbieri RL). Results: Three clinical trials reported that for the treatment of anovulatory infertility caused by PCOS, metformin plusclomiphene is more effective than clomiphene alone ininducing ovulation. For the treatment of irregular mensescaused by PCOS in women not attempting conception,metformin therapy may restore ovulatory menses in themajority of women. However, most women will require 4 - 6months of metformin therapy before they achieve ovulatorymenses. In obese women, metformin plus a low-calorie dietmay be associated with more weight loss than a low-caloriediet alone. Conclusion: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common gynecologic endocrine disorder. Obstetrician-gynecologistsshould be familiar with the indications and contraindicationsfor the use of metformin in their practice. OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment Thanks to Dr. Woitte for reminding us about the high frequency of PCOS. We should maintain a high index of suspicion, especially because PCOS is highly amenable tomedical therapy. Metformin has other beneficial uses in thetreatment of glucose intolerance and in the prevention of typeII DM seen during the Diabetes Prevention Program (Knowleret al, 2002). Another common question is, what is the role of metformin in lactation? The official notation is, \" Excretion in breast milk unknown/not recommended,\" but please also review the following case series published in the June 2005 CCC Cornerby Briggs. Metformin was excreted into breast milk, and neither hypoglycemia nor other adverse effects were observed in threenursing infants. Conclusion: Metformin is excreted into breast milk, but the amounts seem to be clinically insignificant. No adverseeffects on the blood glucose of the three nursing infants weremeasured.

IHS Child Health Notes April 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 98Quote of the month \"It ain' t what people don't know that' s so dangerous, it' s what people know that just ain't so. \"Will Rogers Articles of Interest Hearing thresholds and tympanic membrane sequelae in children managed medically or surgically for otitis media with effusion.

A 10 year follow-up of children who were randomized to either medical or surgical treatment for persistentotitis media with effusion (OME) Surgical treatment was with ventilating tubes that were removed after 12 months Medical treatment was with low dose sulfisoxazole for six months The risk of long term tympanic membrane abnormalities (sclerosis, retractions, perforations)was 4.4 times higher in the group that had ventilationtubes placed Hearing thresholds were 2.1 to 8.1 dB higher in children who had undergone placement of tubes The risk of mild permanent hearing loss (>15dB) was 3.3 times higher in the group that received ventilating tubes Parental reports of hearing and speech and school success were equal in both groups Editorial Comment Ventilating tubes (VT) have long been considered an acceptable treatment for persistent OME. The AAP ClinicalGuidelines on otitis media with effusion published in 2004 listOME > 4 months as one possible indicator for surgicalplacement of VT. This recommendation is based on a decreasein the number of days with effusion and improved hearinglevels of 6 to 12 dB in children while VT remain in place. VT may provide the short term physiologic benefits described above but they do not demonstrate any long-termbenefit in terms of functional outcomes in normal childrenwith OME. Children with OME followed to age five yearshave similar outcomes in hearing and speech whether they havehad medical therapy or surgical therapy in their younger years.Unfortunately, as the above study shows, VT placement islikely to result in a much greater risk of permanent tympanicmembrane damage and functional hearing loss in children.The 2004 AAP guideline does stress in other sections that \"watchful waiting\" may be an acceptable plan forasymptomatic children with OME. Given the potential harm ofVT, it seems prudent to recommend surgical treatment only forchildren with high risk conditions (Down syndrome or cleftlip), documented speech delay, or significant hearing loss,which is usually defined as > 40dB. In these groups therisk/benefit ratio will favor surgical intervention in spite of thedocumented long-term risks. Recent literature on American Indian/Alaskan Native health; Doug Esposito, MD Redeeming hollow promises: the case for mandatory spending on health care for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Am J Public Health . 2006 Feb 28; [Epub ahead of print] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16507732&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_DocSum The authors describe in detail the federal funding process for Indian health programs as compared to other governmenthealth programs. They discuss the \"discretionary\" fundingstructure of AI/AN programs, and compare that with\"mandatory\" spending for Medicare and Medicaid, presentingthe shocking (but not surprising) statistics of under-funding. In1999, according to the Level of Need Funded Workgroup of theIHS, funding occurred at 54% of what was needed. Severalrecommendations are made that, if enacted, would, in theauthors' opinions, significantly narrow the funding gap and, byextension, allow for meaningful reductions in AI/AN healthdisparities. These include treating funding for AI/AN healthprograms as \"mandatory\" rather than \"discretionary,\"automatically adjusting funding for inflation in order topreserve purchasing power, and making funding rates forAI/AN programs comparable to other government programs.Caution is offered, reflecting pessimism surrounding thepresent political climate and the will and ability of Congress toaddress this problem in any meaningful or productive way. Editorial Comment I believe that this is a landmark paper, written by lawyers with health policy backgrounds, who appear to be motivated by a passion for social justice. Although the data are not new or earthshattering, a uniquely cogent, well organized, and logical argumentcalling for changes in the funding structure for Indian health ismade that even I can follow! Hopefully, this article will find its wayinto the hands of the right people, and help to change the minds ofApril 2006 THE IHS PROVIDER 99our legislators. Please read this article, and pass it along.

Endemic iron deficiency associated with Helicobacter pylori infection among school-aged children in Alaska. Pediatrics. 2006 Mar;117(3):e396-404. Epub 2006 Feb 1.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16452320&query_hl=9&itool=pubmed_DocSum Arctic populations are known to have high rates of iron deficiency that approximate those seen in the developingworld, despite subsistence diets relatively high in iron and lowlevels of intestinal parasitosis. High rates of H. pylori infection are also reported in these same regions. In this study, the authors confirm a high prevalence of iron deficiency (38%), iron deficiency anemia (7.8%), and activeH. pylori infection (86%) among approximately 700 school- age Yupik children residing in remote western Alaska. Theylink as an independent variable active H. pylori infection with iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in these children.Although causality could not be definitively established due tothe cross-sectional study design, they conclude that H. pylori infection might be an important risk factor for iron deficiencyin this population of children who should otherwise be at lowrisk for this micronutrient deficiency. Strengths of the study are large subject numbers, a high participation rate, and a population-based, cross-sectionaldesign. Additionally, a validated method was used to diagnoseactive H. pylori infection, in contrast to most other studies in children that have relied on a serologically derived casedefinition. The authors point out that serologic testing isinsensitive and non-specific in children, in addition to havingan inability to differentiate between active and past infection. Editorial Comment Y et again, an important study reporting interesting and relevant data with broad implications for those of us serving AI/AN populations emerges, thanks to the CDC ArticInvestigations Program in Anchorage, Alaska. What is theprevalence of active H. pylori infection among the specific population of children served in your practice? I searchedPubMed briefly to find out, and identified only a couple ofreports dealing with groups other than those residing in Arcticregions. All of these reports employed either serologic or stoolantigen derived case definitions, with the associated limitations,and had variable study objectives. Active infection ratesunfortunately were not the objective of any of these studies. Twoof these papers are cited below for the interested reader. It is unfortunate that few H. pylori investigations have been done in other Native communities in the US. Given comparablelevels of poverty, crowding, sanitation, etc., that occur in thepopulations we all serve, one might presume similarities in H. pylori epidemiology and its association with iron deficiency. Our collective clinical experience serves to further strengthenthese suspicions. Alas, we will just have to wait for additionalstudies to be done to confirm these concerns. The authors make an important side point worth reiterating. The diagnosis of active H. pylori infection in children is difficult and fraught with significant challenges.The gold standard for diagnosis is biopsy-proven evidence ofthe bacterium on stained tissue samples obtained fromendoscopic examination of the stomach and proximalduodenum. Serologic testing is frequently used in clinicalpractice as a surrogate for this invasive procedure due to itsrelative ease of collection and low cost. Unfortunately,serology is highly inaccurate in this setting. Cautious use andinterpretation of results obtained from this increasingly popularand potentially misused method are certainly warranted. Will treatment of H. pylori infected iron deficient children result in improvement in their iron status? Two reports havebeen published by the Arctic Investigations Program reportingthe results of this arm of their study, although I could notproperly review them on short notice. I was able tocommunicate briefly with Dr. Baggett, a co-author of both ofthese reports (cited below) and learned that no effect on irondeficiency was found after treatment of H. pylori. A wholehost of explanations can be posited for this finding, but thedetails will have to wait until the next installment of thiscolumn. Can you wait that long? Drum roll, please!

With WebEx training, participants can attend theclass from their own computer at their office or in a conferenceroom with other attendees. The WebEx training has enabledmore people to attend the training than ever before since theydo not need to spend time and money traveling to the training.This is very beneficial for clinicians, since their time awayfrom their facility is limited. Over 120 people received trainingin the Aberdeen Area alone, which is equivalent to 72% of all the people trained on CRS in 2005! Here are a few commentsfrom students who attended the WebEx training: \"I think WebEx is a super great teaching tool. It saved meten hours of driving and a day away from work, and it wasa VERY effective learning strategy. I learned a lot,thanks. \" - Leslye, Winnebago Hospital, Nebraska \"I love WebEx and can't wait until the voice feature isinstalled so that we can record the sessions with thediscussion. \" - Nicholas, American Indian Health & Services, California \"The WebEx session was totally convenient for our clinic.Much better than traveling to the Area Office for atraining. \" - Louise, Lassen Indian Health Center, California \"This will be very useful. Having it brought to us ratherthan traveling to another site enabled more people toparticipate here. \" - Joanne, Rosebud Comprehensive Health Care Facility, South Dakota Requirements for WebEx training include pre-registering online for the class, a one-time installation of the WebExsoftware, a computer, and a phone. Instructions for registeringand attending the class are sent out several weeks before thetraining and include a contact name and number if additionalinformation is needed.Due to the success of this type of training, the IHS is purchasing equipment that will enable a session to be recorded,which could then be viewed by an attendee at his/herconvenience. In addition, next year' s training will include evenmore WebEx sessions, and multiple types of training sessionswill be offered that will be tailored to the audience.
