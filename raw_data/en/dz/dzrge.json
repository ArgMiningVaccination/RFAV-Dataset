Why is there a shortage of flu vaccine? The British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency suspended the manufacturing license of one of the two manufacturers of injectable flu vaccine. This caused a 50-percent reduction of the available supply of United States flu vaccine. Does MUSC have flu vaccine? Not at this time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are working with the remaining manufacturer of injectable flu vaccine to allocate 22.4 million doses of the vaccine across the nation. At this time, we do not know the allocation for the MUSC hospital and clinics; however, we expect to receive a supply. Once we have the vaccine, we will announce our own allocation plan. A task force of clinicians and administrators at MUSC has been working with local and state DHEC departments to communicate MUSC's needs and obtain a supply. When will MUSC get the flu vaccine? An allocation plan between the CDC and Aventis Pasteur is being discussed. The details of this plan have not been released, as the group is surveying areas across the nation to determine the areas of most need. When our allocation is announced, the administration will release the information through Medical Center leadership. What about Flumist? Flumist is a live attenuated vaccine intended for active immunization against the influenza virus. It is administered intranasally and is intended for healthy people ages 5 to 49 years. Flumist should not be given to patients with known or suspected immune deficiencies, those with an egg allergy, patients 5 to 17 years of age who are being treated with aspirin therapy, or health care workers that will care for profoundly immunosupressed patients within seven days of vaccination. The Medical Center is working to procure Flumist for our health care workers with direct patient care and for patients who meet vaccination criteria. Additional details about vaccination procedures with Flumist will be available soon and will be communicated through MUSC supervisors. Where else can I get the flu vaccine? At this time, we expect MUSC to get the vaccine through the CDC allocation process; however, we are not sure when and in what quantity. Health care workers will be prioritized based on patient-care activities. The health departments in Charleston are taking appointments for patients who want the vaccine. For up-to-the-minute flu vaccine stock, they should be contacted. In addition, some area pharmacies have scheduled flu vaccine clinics. Your primary care provider may also have the vaccine or be able to refer you to a clinic with vaccine. Who should get vaccinated this season? Because of a shortfall in vaccine production for this season, CDC is recommending that certain people be given priority for getting the vaccine. People in the following groups should seek vaccination this season: all children aged 6 to 23 months; adults aged 65 years and older; persons aged 2 to 64 years with underlying chronic medical conditions; all women who will be pregnant during the influenza season; residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities; children aged 6 months to 18 years on chronic aspirin therapy; health care workers involved in direct patient care; and out-of-home caregivers and household contacts of children aged to 6 months. These people are considered at high risk for serious flu complications or have contact with people at high risk for serious flu complications. If you are not in this group, the CDC asks that you forgo the vaccination this year so the limited stock may be reserved for those most at risk. What other steps can be taken to prevent the flu? Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick, too. If possible, stay home from work, school and errands when you are sick. You will help prevent the spread of your illness to others. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Washing your hands often will help protect against germs. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs are often spread when a person touches something contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth.
