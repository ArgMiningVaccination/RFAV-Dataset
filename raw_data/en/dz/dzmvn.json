The State may rely on a finding from an Express Lane agency notwithstanding sections 1902(a)(46)(B) and 1137(d) or any differences in budget unit, disregard, deeming or other methodology, if the following requirements are met: [(I)] Prohibition on determining children ineligible for coverage.\u2014If a finding from an Express Lane agency would result in a determination that a child does not satisfy an eligibility requirement for medical assistance under this title and for child health assistance under title XXI, the State shall determine eligibility for assistance using its regular procedures.

[(C)] Options for satisfying the screen and enroll requirement.\u2014 [(i)] In general.\u2014With respect to a child whose eligibility for medical assistance under this title or for child health assistance under title XXI has been evaluated by a State agency using an income finding from an Express Lane agency, a State may carry out its duties under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 2102(b)(3) (relating to screen and enroll) in accordance with either clause (ii) or clause (iii). [(ii)] Establishing a screening threshold.\u2014 [(I)] In general.\u2014Under this clause, the State establishes a screening threshold set as a percentage of the Federal poverty level that exceeds the highest income threshold applicable under this title to the child by a minimum of 30 percentage points or, at State option, a higher number of percentage points that reflects the value (as determined by the State and described in the State plan) of any differences between income methodologies used by the program administered by the Express Lane agency and the methodologies used by the State in determining eligibility for medical assistance under this title. [(II)] Children with income not above threshold.\u2014If the income of a child does not exceed the screening threshold, the child is deemed to satisfy the income eligibility criteria for medical assistance under this title regardless of whether such child would otherwise satisfy such criteria.

[(IV)] Requirement for simplified determination.\u2014In making such a determination, the State shall use procedures that, to the maximum feasible extent, reduce the burden imposed on the individual of such determination. Such procedures may not require the child's parent, guardian, or custodial relative to provide or verify information that already has been provided to the State agency by an Express Lane agency or another source of information unless the State agency has reason to believe the information is erroneous. [(V)] Availability of chip matching funds during temporary enrollment period.\u2014Medical assistance for items and services that are provided to a child enrolled in title XXI during a temporary enrollment period under this clause shall be treated as child health assistance under such title.

[(i)] [(1)] In addition to any other authority under State law, where a State determines that a intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded which is certified for participation under its plan no longer substantially meets the requirements for such a facility under this title and further determines that the facility's deficiencies\u2014 [(A)] immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its patients, the State shall provide for the termination of the facility's certification for participation under the plan and may provide, or [(B)] do not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its patients, the State may, in lieu of providing for terminating the facility's certification for participation under the plan, establish alternative remedies if the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the alternative remedies are effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies, and may provide that no payment will be made under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to such facility after a date specified by the State. [(2)] The State shall not make such a decision with respect to a facility until the facility has had a reasonable opportunity, following the initial determination that it no longer substantially meets the requirements for such a facility under this title, to correct its deficiencies, and, following this period, has been given reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.

[(3)] Notwithstanding subsection (a)(17), for individuals who are eligible for medical assistance because of subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), or (a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX)\u2014 [(A)] application of a resource standard shall be at the option of the State; [(B)] any resource standard or methodology that is applied with respect to an individual described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) may not be more restrictive than the resource standard or methodology that is applied under title XVI; [(C)] any resource standard or methodology that is applied with respect to an individual described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) may not be more restrictive than the corresponding methodology that is applied under the State plan under part A of title IV; [(D)] the income standard to be applied is the appropriate income standard established under paragraph (2); and [(E)] family income shall be determined in accordance with the methodology employed under the State plan under part A or E of title IV (except to the extent such methodology is inconsistent with clause (D) of subsection (a)(17)), and costs incurred for medical care or for any other type of remedial care shall not be taken into account. Any different treatment provided under this paragraph for such individuals shall not, because of subsection (a)(17), require or permit such treatment for other individuals. [(4)] [(A)] In the case of any State which is providing medical assistance to its residents under a waiver granted under section 1115, the Secretary shall require the State to provide medical assistance for pregnant women and infants under age 1 described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and for children described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) or subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) in the same manner as the State would be required to provide such assistance for such individuals if the State had in effect a plan approved under this title. [(B)] In the case of a State which is not one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia, the State need not meet the requirement of subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), or (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) and, for purposes of paragraph (2)(A), the State may substitute for the percentage provided under clause (ii) of such paragraph any percentage. [(m)] [(1)] Individuals described in this paragraph are individuals\u2014 [(A)] who are 65 years of age or older or are disabled individuals (as determined under section 1614(a)(3)), [(B)] whose income (as determined under section 1612 for purposes of the supplemental security income program, except as provided in paragraph (2)(C)) does not exceed an income level established by the State consistent with paragraph (2)(A), and [(C)] whose resources (as determined under section 1613 for purposes of the supplemental security income program) do not exceed (except as provided in paragraph (2)(B)) the maximum amount of resources that an individual may have and obtain benefits under that program. [(2)] [(A)] The income level established under paragraph (1)(B) may not exceed a percentage (not more than 100 percent) of the official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with section 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 [[77]](#ft77)) applicable to a family of the size involved. [(B)] In the case of a State that provides medical assistance to individuals not described in subsection (a)(10)(A) and at the State's option, the State may use under paragraph (1)(C) such resource level (which is higher than the level described in that paragraph) as may be applicable with respect to individuals described in paragraph (1)(A) who are not described in subsection (a)(10)(A). [(C)] The provisions of section 1905(p)(2)(D) shall apply to determinations of income under this subsection in the same manner as they apply to determinations of income under section 1905(p). [(3)] Notwithstanding subsection (a)(17), for individuals described in paragraph (1) who are covered under the State plan by virtue of subsection (a)(10)(A)(ii)(X)\u2014 [(A)] the income standard to be applied is the income standard described in paragraph (1)(B), and [(B)] except as provided in section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii), costs incurred for medical care or for any other type of remedial care shall not be taken into account in determining income. Any different treatment provided under this paragraph for such individuals shall not, because of subsection (a)(17), require or permit such treatment for other individuals. [(4)] Notwithstanding subsection (a)(17), for qualified medicare beneficiaries described in section 1905(p)(1)\u2014 [(A)] the income standard to be applied is the income standard described in section 1905(p)(1)(B), and [(B)] except as provided in section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii), costs incurred for medical care or for any other type of remedial care shall not be taken into account in determining income. Any different treatment provided under this paragraph for such individuals shall not, because of subsection (a)(17), require or permit such treatment for other individuals. [(n)] [(1)] In the case of medical assistance furnished under this title for medicare cost-sharing respecting the furnishing of a service or item to a qualified medicare beneficiary, the State plan may provide payment in an amount with respect to the service or item that results in the sum of such payment amount and any amount of payment made under title XVIII with respect to the service or item exceeding the amount that is otherwise payable under the State plan for the item or service for eligible individuals who are not qualified medicare beneficiaries. [(2)] In carrying out paragraph (1), a State is not required to provide any payment for any expenses incurred relating to payment for deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments for medicare cost-sharing to the extent that payment under title XVIII for the service would exceed the payment amount that otherwise would be made under the State plan under this title for such service if provided to an eligible recipient other than a medicare beneficiary. [(3)] In the case in which a State's payment for medicare cost-sharing for a qualified medicare beneficiary with respect to an item or service is reduced or eliminated through the application of paragraph (2)\u2014 [(A)] for purposes of applying any limitation under title XVIII on the amount that the beneficiary may be billed or charged for the service, the amount of payment made under title XVIII plus the amount of payment (if any) under the State plan shall be considered to be payment in full for the service; [(B)] the beneficiary shall not have any legal liability to make payment to a provider or to an organization described in section 1903(m)(1)(A) for the service; and [(C)] any lawful sanction that may be imposed upon a provider or such an organization for excess charges under this title or title XVIII shall apply to the imposition of any charge imposed upon the individual in such case. This paragraph shall not be construed as preventing payment of any medicare cost-sharing by a medicare supplemental policy or an employer retiree health plan on behalf of an individual. [(o)] Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a) to the contrary, a State plan under this title shall provide that any supplemental security income benefits paid by reason of subparagraph (E) or (G) of section 1611(e)(1) to an individual who\u2014 [(1)] is eligible for medical assistance under the plan, and [(2)] is in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or intermediate care facility at the time such benefits are paid, will be disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of any post-eligibility contribution by the individual to the cost of the care and services provided by the hospital, skilled nursing facility, or intermediate care facility. [(p)] [(1)] In addition to any other authority, a State may exclude any individual or entity for purposes of participating under the State plan under this title for any reason for which the Secretary could exclude the individual or entity from participation in a program under title XVIII under section 1128, 1128A, or 1866(b)(2). [(2)] In order for a State to receive payments for medical assistance under section 1903(a), with respect to payments the State makes to a medicaid managed care organization (as defined in section 1903(m)) or to an entity furnishing services under a waiver approved under section 1915(b)(1), the State must provide that it will exclude from participation, as such an organization or entity, any organization or entity that\u2014 [(A)] could be excluded under section 1128(b)(8) (relating to owners and managing employees who have been convicted of certain crimes or received other sanctions), [(B)] has, directly or indirectly, a substantial contractual relationship (as defined by the Secretary) with an individual or entity that is described in section 1128(b)(8)(B), or [(C)] employs or contracts with any individual or entity that is excluded from participation under this title under section 1128 or 1128A for the provision of health care, utilization review, medical social work, or administrative services or employs or contracts with any entity for the provision (directly or indirectly) through such an excluded individual or entity of such services. [(3)] As used in this subsection, the term \"exclude\" includes the refusal to enter into or renew a participation agreement or the termination of such an agreement. [(q)] [(1)] [(A)] In order to meet the requirement of subsection (a)(50), the State plan must provide that, in the case of an institutionalized individual or couple described in subparagraph (B), in determining the amount of the individual's or couple's income to be applied monthly to payment for the cost of care in an institution, there shall be deducted from the monthly income (in addition to other allowances otherwise provided under the State plan) a monthly personal needs allowance\u2014 [(i)] which is reasonable in amount for clothing and other personal needs of the individual (or couple) while in an institution, and [(ii)] which is not less (and may be greater) than the minimum monthly personal needs allowance described in paragraph (2). [(B)] In this subsection, the term \"institutionalized individual or couple\" means an individual or married couple\u2014 [(i)] who is an inpatient (or who are inpatients) in a medical institution or nursing facility for which payments are made under this title throughout a month, and [(ii)] who is or are determined to be eligible for medical assistance under the State plan. [(2)] The minimum monthly personal needs allowance described in this paragraph is $30 for an institutionalized individual and $60 for an institutionalized couple (if both are aged, blind, or disabled, and their incomes are considered available to each other in determining eligibility). [(r)] [(1)] [(A)] For purposes of sections 1902(a)(17) and 1924(d)(1)(D) and for purposes of a waiver under section 1915, with respect to the post-eligibility treatment of income of individuals who are institutionalized or receiving home or community-based services under such a waiver, the treatment described in subparagraph (B) shall apply, there shall be disregarded reparation payments made by the Federal Republic of Germany, and there shall be taken into account amounts for incurred expenses for medical or remedial care that are not subject to payment by a third party, including\u2014 [(i)] medicare and other health insurance premiums, deductibles, or coinsurance, and [(ii)] necessary medical or remedial care recognized under State law but not covered under the State plan under this title, subject to reasonable limits the State may establish on the amount of these expenses. [(B)] [(i)] In the case of a veteran who does not have a spouse or a child, if the veteran\u2014 [(I)] receives, after the veteran has been determined to be eligible for medical assistance under the State plan under this title, a veteran's pension in excess of $90 per month, and [(II)] resides in a State veterans home with respect to which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs makes per diem payments for nursing home care pursuant to section 1741(a) of title 38, United States Code [[78]](#ft78), any such pension payment, including any payment made due to the need for aid and attendance, or for unreimbursed medical expenses, that is in excess of $90 per month shall be counted as income only for the purpose of applying such excess payment to the State veterans home's cost of providing nursing home care to the veteran. [(ii)] The provisions of clause (i) shall apply with respect to a surviving spouse of a veteran who does not have a child in the same manner as they apply to a veteran described in such clause. [(2)] [(A)] The methodology to be employed in determining income and resource eligibility for individuals under subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(III), (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), (a)(10)(A)(ii), (a)(10)(C)(i)(III), or (f) or under section 1905(p) may be less restrictive, and shall be no more restrictive, than the methodology\u2014 [(i)] in the case of groups consisting of aged, blind, or disabled individuals, under the supplemental security income program under title XVI, or [(ii)] in the case of other groups, under the State plan most closely categorically related. [(B)] For purposes of this subsection and subsection (a)(10), methodology is considered to be \"no more restrictive\" if, using the methodology, additional individuals may be eligible for medical assistance and no individuals who are otherwise eligible are made ineligible for such assistance. [(s)] In order to meet the requirements of subsection (a)(55), the State plan must provide that payments to hospitals under the plan for inpatient hospital services furnished to infants who have not attained the age of 1 year, and to children who have not attained the age of 6 years and who receive such services in a disproportionate share hospital described in section 1923(b)(1), shall\u2014 [(1)] if made on a prospective basis (whether per diem, per case, or otherwise) provide for an outlier adjustment in payment amounts for medically necessary inpatient hospital services involving exceptionally high costs or exceptionally long lengths of stay, [(2)] not be limited by the imposition of day limits with respect to the delivery of such services to such individuals, and [(3)] not be limited by the imposition of dollar limits (other than such limits resulting from prospective payments as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (1)) with respect to the delivery of such services to any such individual who has not attained their first birthday (or in the case of such an individual who is an inpatient on his first birthday until such individual is discharged). [(t)] Nothing in this title (including sections 1903(a) and 1905(a)) shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to deny or limit payments to a State for expenditures, for medical assistance for items or services, attributable to taxes of general applicability imposed with respect to the provision of such items or services. [(u)] [(1)] Individuals described in this paragraph are individuals\u2014 [(A)] who are entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage (as defined in paragraph (3)), [(B)] whose income (as determined under section 1612 for purposes of the supplemental security income program) does not exceed 100 percent of the official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with section 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 [[79]](#ft79)) applicable to a family of the size involved, [(C)] whose resources (as determined under section 1613 for purposes of the supplemental security income program) do not exceed twice the maximum amount of resources that an individual may have and obtain benefits under that program, and [(D)] with respect to whose enrollment for COBRA continuation coverage the State has determined that the savings in expenditures under this title resulting from such enrollment is likely to exceed the amount of payments for COBRA premiums made. [(2)] For purposes of subsection (a)(10)(F) and this subsection, the term \"COBRA premiums\" means the applicable premium imposed with respect to COBRA continuation coverage. [(3)] In this subsection, the term \"COBRA continuation coverage\" means coverage under a group health plan provided by an employer with 75 or more employees provided pursuant to title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or title VI of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [[80]](#ft80). [(4)] Notwithstanding subsection (a)(17), for individuals described in paragraph (1) who are covered under the State plan by virtue of subsection (a)(10)(A)(ii)(XI)\u2014 [(A)] the income standard to be applied is the income standard described in paragraph (1)(B), and [(B)] except as provided in section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii), costs incurred for medical care or for any other type of remedial care shall not be taken into account in determining income. Any different treatment provided under this paragraph for such individuals shall not, because of subsection (a)(10)(B) or (a)(17), require or permit such treatment for other individuals. [(v)] A State plan may provide for the making of determinations of disability or blindness for the purpose of determining eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan by the single State agency or its designee, and make medical assistance available to individuals whom it finds to be blind or disabled and who are determined otherwise eligible for such assistance during the period of time prior to which a final determination of disability or blindness is made by the Social Security Administration with respect to such an individual. In making such determinations, the State must apply the definitions of disability and blindness found in section 1614(a) of the Social Security Act. [(w)] [(1)] For purposes of subsection (a)(57) and sections 1903(m)(1)(A) and 1919(c)(2)(E), the requirement of this subsection is that a provider or organization (as the case may be) maintain written policies and procedures with respect to all adult individuals receiving medical care by or through the provider or organization\u2014 [(A)] to provide written information to each such individual concerning\u2014 [(i)] an individual's rights under State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State) to make decisions concerning such medical care, including the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment and the right to formulate advance directives (as defined in paragraph (3)), and [(ii)] the provider's or organization's written policies respecting the implementation of such rights; [(B)] to document in the individual's medical record whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive; [(C)] not to condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate against an individual based on whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive; [(D)] to ensure compliance with requirements of State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State) respecting advance directives; and [(E)] to provide (individually or with others) for education for staff and the community on issues concerning advance directives. Subparagraph (C) shall not be construed as requiring the provision of care which conflicts with an advance directive. [(2)] The written information described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be provided to an adult individual\u2014 [(A)] in the case of a hospital, at the time of the individual's admission as an inpatient, [(B)] in the case of a nursing facility, at the time of the individual's admission as a resident, [(C)] in the case of a provider of home health care or personal care services, in advance of the individual coming under the care of the provider, [(D)] in the case of a hospice program, at the time of initial receipt of hospice care by the individual from the program, and [(E)] in the case of a medicaid managed care organization, at the time of enrollment of the individual with the organization. [(3)] Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the application of a State law which allows for an objection on the basis of conscience for any health care provider or any agent of such provider which as a matter of conscience cannot implement an advance directive. [(4)] In this subsection, the term \"advance directive\" means a written instruction, such as a living will or durable power of attorney for health care, recognized under State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State) and relating to the provision of such care when the individual is incapacitated. [(5)] For construction relating to this subsection, see section 7 of the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 (relating to clarification respecting assisted suicide, euthanasia, and mercy killing) [[81]](#ft81). [(x)] The Secretary shall establish a system, for implementation by not later than July 1, 1991, which provides for a unique identifier for each physician who furnishes services for which payment may be made under a State plan approved under this title. [[82]](#ft82) [(y)] [(1)] In addition to any other authority under State law, where a State determines that a psychiatric hospital which is certified for participation under its plan no longer meets the requirements for a psychiatric hospital (referred to in section 1905(h)) and further finds that the hospital's deficiencies\u2014 [(A)] immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its patients, the State shall terminate the hospital's participation under the State plan; or [(B)] do not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its patients, the State may terminate the hospital's participation under the State plan, or provide that no payment will be made under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to such hospital after the effective date of the finding, or both. [(2)] Except as provided in paragraph (3), if a psychiatric hospital described in paragraph (1)(B) has not complied with the requirements for a psychiatric hospital under this title\u2014 [(A)] within 3 months after the date the hospital is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, the State shall provide that no payment will be made under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to such hospital after the end of such 3-month period, or [(B)] within 6 months after the date the hospital is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, no Federal financial participation shall be provided under section 1903(a) with respect to further services provided in the hospital until the State finds that the hospital is in compliance with the requirements of this title. [(3)] The Secretary may continue payments, over a period of not longer than 6 months from the date the hospital is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, if\u2014 [(A)] the State finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the hospital with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the hospital, [(B)] the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action, and [(C)] the State agrees to repay to the Federal Government payments received under this paragraph if the corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable.
