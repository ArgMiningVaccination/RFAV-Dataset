General Guideline Principles ................................ ................................ WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 7 A. GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatment required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's hea lth to its pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesses. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and gi ven relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within a well -defined timeframe, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. These timeframes may be slightly longer i n the context of conditions that are inherently mental health issues, and shorter for other non - musculoskeletal medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic etc.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respond should prompt the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community should be a primary emphasis in the treatment of work -related injury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implement effective educational strategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should a lways start with communication providing reassuring information to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self - management of symptoms and prevention of f uture injury. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 8 Time Frames A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month, and Chronic - greater than three months. A.7 Initial Evaluation Initia l evaluation refers to the acute timeframe following an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initial encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time frames for conducting diagnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.9 Treatment Ti me Frames Treatment time frames for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. It is recognized that treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, pat ient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.10 Delayed Recovery For those patients who fail to make e xpected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be performed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a mental health issue, assessment for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychological issues) should be ongoing throughout the care of the patient. At 6 -12 weeks, alternate treatment programs, i ncluding formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation should be considered. Clinicians must be vigilant for any pre -existing mental health issues or subsequent, consequential mental health issues that may be impacting recovery. For issues that are clear ly and inherently mental health issues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work -related, mental health disorder as part of the claim at issue), referral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner. Referra ls to mental health providers for the evaluation and management of delayed recovery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological condition. The evaluation and management of delayed recovery does not require the establishme nt of a psychiatric or psychological claim. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 9 Treatment Approaches A.11 Active Interventions Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are vie wed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clinically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or comm unity settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of imaging procedures and interpretation of results. All diagnostic procedures have characteristic specificities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selection of one procedure over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile patient's tolerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a sec ond diagnostic procedure is not required. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g. physiatrist, sports medicine physician or other appropriate specia list) radiologist or surgeon documents that the initial study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure is permissible under the MTG. It is recognized that repeat imagi ng studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and/or to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the patho logy when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections when clinically indicated, and post - operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding serial imaging, (including x -rays, but particular ly CT scans), it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. A given diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as obtained by other procedures. There fore, prudent choice of procedures(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, and promote efficiency by avoiding duplication or redundancy. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 10 A.14 Surgical Interventions Consideration of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and imaging and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assim ilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause. I n all cases, shared decision making with the patient is advised. The patient should be given the opportunity to understand the pros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative where applicable, evidence -based outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre -Authorization All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgical and surgical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics within the criteria of the Medical Treatment Guidelines and based o n a correct application of the Medical Treatment Guidelines are considered authorized, with the exception of the procedures listed in section 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not included on the list of pre -authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Second or subsequent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgical procedure due to failure of, or incomplete success from the same s urgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures) also require pre -authorization. A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric Evaluations In select patients, mental health evaluations are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration of evaluations and/or interventions by mental health professionals may vary, particularly based on whether: the underl ying clinical issue in the claim is inherently a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question; or there is a pre -existing, unrelated men tal health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question. Tests of psychological function or psychometric testing, when indicated, can be a valuable component of the psychological evaluation in identifying associated psychological, personality and psychosocial issues . Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagno sis should only be made after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. A professional fluent in the primary language of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpreter must be provided. Frequency: When assessing for a pre -existing, unrelated mental h ealth issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) a work -related, medical injury or illness, then a one -time visit for initial psychiatric/psychological encounter should NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 11 be sufficient, as care would normally be continued b y the prior treating provider. If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial encounter, time for such testing should not exceed an additional three hours of professional time. For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central par t of the initial claim, or in which there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the work -related, medical injury or illness, that is part of the claim in question, then more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed in detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such mental health conditions. A.17 Personality/Psychological/Psychosocial Intervention Following psyc hosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions planned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. Optimum duration: six weeks to three months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseling is not intended to delay but rather to enhance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. For select patients, longer supervision and treatment may be req uired, and if further treatment is indicated, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every four weeks during the first six months of treatment. For treatment expected to last six to twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to eight weeks. For long -term treatment beyond twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. All parties should strive for ongoing and continuous communications, in order to facilitate seamless, continuous and uninterrupted treatment. A.18 Functional Capacity Evaluation (F CE) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of function as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dy namic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of- motion, coordination and strength, worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitive, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this eval uation may include: (a) musculoskeletal lift/carrying analysis; (e) job - specific activity tolerance; (f) maximum voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) n on-material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavioral; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 12 An FCE may be considered at ti me of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, when the treating physician is unable to make a clear determination on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated early during a treatment regim e for any reason including one to support a therapeutic plan. When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physician is responsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCEs cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician must interpret the FCE in light of the individual patient's presentation and medical and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to diagnose malingering. A.19 Return To Work For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of me dical care , and should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provid e the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work, since the p rognosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker has been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by video conference, or by telephone, to obtain information regarding the individual or specific demands of the patient's pre -injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repetitive activities, l oad lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental exposures, psychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re -entry, risk of re -injury or disrupt convalescence. When returning to work at the patient's previous job tasks or set ting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's activities, inquiry should be made about modified duty work settings that align with, the patient's condition in view of proposed work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, that under certain circumstances, more than one job site evaluation may be indicated. Ideally, the physician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it is recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information, as can video conferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work area. Frequency: one or two c ontacts. 1st contact : Patient is in a functional state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd c ontact : Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. The physician shall document the conversation. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 13 Other A.21 Guideline Recommendations And Medical Evidence The Workers' Compensation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have relied on the methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigational Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigational and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizing that in certain circumstances there is no doctor -patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address s cope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 14 Ankle and Foot Disorders Effective date will coincide with the launch of OnBoard: Limited Release B. Introduction This guideline addresses common and potentially work -related ankle and foot injuries . It encompasses assessment; including identification of \"red flags\" or indicators of potentially -serious injury or disease; diagnosis; diagnostic studies for identification of clinical pathology and management . Red flags include fracture, dislocation, malignancy, metabolic disorders, infection, and other conditions. B.1 History Taking and Physical Examination B.1.a History Taking and Physical Examination History taking and physical examination establish the foundation/basis for and dictate subsequent stages of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. When findings of clinical evaluations and those of other diagnostic procedures are not consistent with each o ther, the objective clinical findings should have preference. The medical records should reasonably document the following: B.1.b History of Present Injury Mechanism of injury: This includes details of symptom onset and progression, and symptoms that may arise from postural or functional accommod ation to the Ankle -Foot injury; Relationship to work: This includes a statement of the probability that the illness or injury is work -related; Prior occupational and non -occupational injuries: To the same area including specific prior treatment; Ability to perform job duties and activi ties of daily living; and Exacerbating and alleviating factors for symptoms; not limited to the Ankle - Foot. B.1.c Past History Past medical history includes, but is not limited to, neoplasm, gout, arthritis, and diabetes; Review of systems includes, but is not limited to, symptoms of rheumatologic, neurologic, endocrine, neoplastic, and other systemic diseases; Smoking history; Vocational and recreational pursuits; Prior imaging studies; and Past surgical history. B.1.d Physical Examination Examination of a joint should include the joint above and below the affected area, including the opposite side for comparison. Physical examination should include NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 15 accepted tests and exam techniques applicable to the joint or area being examined, including: Visual inspection - Examine both feet and look for and note asymmetries and for deformities suggestive of degeneration, malformation, fracture, or dislocations . Observe for signs of serious injuries, e.g., degloving injuries, lacerations, puncture woun ds, open wounds and crush injuries ; Palpation; Range of motion/quality of motion (active and passive); The range of motion (ROM) of the foot and ankle should be determined both actively and passively. Compare mobility of the affected and una ffected side; Strength (weakness / atrophy) ; Joint integrity / stability - Stress the ligaments to assess the stability and compare to contralateral unaffected side ; Examination for deformity/displacement ; and Assess neurologic (motor, sensory and reflexes) and vascular status (integrity of distal circulation, peripheral pulses, skin temperature) of the foot and ankle, as clinically indicated. Observe for signs of serious injuries, e.g., degloving injuries, lacerations, puncture wounds open wounds and crush injuries. B.2 Assessing Red Flags Certain findings, \"red flags\" raise suspicion of potentially serious medical conditions. Assessment (history and physical examination) should include evaluation for red flags. In the foot and ankle these findings or indicators may include: fracture, dislocations, infection or inflammation, tumor, tendon rupture and neurological or vascular compromise including compartment syndrome. Further evaluation/consultation or urgent/emergency intervention may be indicated, and the New York An kle and Foot Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines incorporate changes in clinical management triggered by the presence of \"red flags\" . Table 1. Red Flags for Potentially Serious Ankle and Foot Conditions Disorder Medical History Physical Examination Dislocation Significant ankle or foot trauma Ankle or foot deformity with or without spontaneous reduction or self -reduction Edema Deformity Fracture Significant trauma Abnormal mobility Deformity with or without spontaneous or self - reduction Painful swelling of ankle or foot Edema Ecchymosis or hematoma Deformity Abnormal mobility Bony crepitus Infection Swelling, redness, localized warmth of ankle or foot Fever or chills Diabetes or immunosuppression (e.g., transplant, chemotherapy , HIV) Visible and/or palpable mass Local tenderness, heat, swelling, erythema Systemic signs of infection (fever, tachycardia) Inflammation Inflammatory arthritis or autoimmune disease Swelling, effusion, erythema, warmth, or edema Metabolic disorder Poor nutrition NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 16 Changes in weight, appetite, energy level, skin, or bowel or bladder function Hair loss Acute gout Sudden attack(s) of joint pain, redness, and swelling, usually monarticular, especially of the great toes Predisposing factors of being a man or post - menopausal woman, renal impairment, hyperuricemia, and use of diuretics or cytotoxic drugs Swelling Red, tender, warm first metatarsal joint Neoplasm Neoplastic disorder Unexplained weight loss, fatigue, masses Palpable mass Deformity of ankle or foot Rapidly progressive neurological compromise Neuropathy, decreased or absent sensation Neurologic disease Diabetes Dislocation or fracture May have sustained laceration, or direct trauma Decreased sensation in feet and ankles Loss of vibratory or positional sense Altered sensation in a dermatomal distribution Absent ankle jerk Motor loss in specific distribution Painless swelling (Charcot's joint) Rapidly progressive vascular compromise Diabetes Peripheral vascular disease or bypass grafts Dislocation or fracture May have sustained laceration, or direct trauma Decreased or absent foot and ankle pulses Decreased capillary filling Cold, pale extremity Tendon ruptures and evulsions Achilles Sharp pain to the posterior distal calf or ankle, may be accompanied by loud pop Forceful plantarflexion of the foot, or unaccustomed and vigorous running, hiking, or climbing May have sustained laceration, open wounds, crush injuries, or dire ct trauma May have degloving injury Administration of fluoroquinolones or local injections Swelling and bruising Inability to point foot downward and stand or walk comfortably Positive Thompson test May have overlying signs of trauma including laceration, open wounds, puncture wounds, crush injuries Peroneal Pain and swelling of the lateral heel May have sustained laceration, open wounds, crush injuries, or direct trauma May have degloving injury Impaired eversion strength May have overlying signs of trauma including laceration, open wounds, puncuture wounds or crush Tibialis, Anterior Swelling and pain in the anterior ankle May have sustained laceration, open wounds, crush injuries, or direct trauma May have degloving injury Anterior ankle tenderness, probable impaired dorsiflexion strength, tenderness at the first metatarsal or metatarsophalangeal joint May have overlying signs of trauma including laceration, open wounds, puncture wounds, crush injuries Tibialis, Posterior Medial ankle pain and swelling, particularly if behind the medial malleolus, new or Flatfoot deformity, particularly posterior medial malleolus, NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 17 progressive flatfoot deformity (with or without pain) May have sustained laceration, open wounds, crush injuries, or direct trauma May have degloving inj ury asymmetrical flatfoot , difficulty with ipsilateral heel raise May have overlying signs of trauma including laceration, open wounds, puncture wounds, or crush injuries B.3 Diagnostic Criteria and Differential Diagnosis For most cases presenting with true foot and ankle disorders, diagnostic studies are usually not needed until after a period of conservative care and observation. Most ankle and foot problems improve quickly once any red flags are ruled out. Routine testing, i.e., laboratory tests, plain -film radiographs of the foot or ankle, or special imaging studies are not recommended during the fir st month of activity limitation except when a red flag that is noted on history or examination raises suspicion of a dangerous foot or ankle condition or of referred pain. B.3.a Diagnostic Testing and Procedures One diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as obtained by other procedures. Therefore, prudent choice of procedure(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s) , or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize adverse effect to patients and promote cost effectiveness by avoiding duplication or redundancy. All diagnostic imaging procedures have a significant percentage of specificity and sensitivity for various diagnoses. None is specifically characteristic of a certain diagnosis. Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection and interpretation of im aging procedure results. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, the second diagnostic procedure will be redundant if it is performed only for diagnostic purposes. At the same time, a subsequent diagnostic procedure (that may be a repeat of the same procedure, when the rehabilitation physician, radiologist or surgeon documents that the study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis) can be a complement ary diagnostic procedure if the first or preceding procedures, in conjunction with clinical information, cannot provide an accurate diagnosis. Usually, preference of a procedure over others depends upon availability, a patient's tolerance, and/or the treat ing practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedu res (e.g. imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and therapeutic injections when warranted, and post -operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding CT examinations, it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. When indicated, the following can be utilized for further evaluation of foot and ankle injuries, based upon the mechanism of injury, symptoms, and patient history.

Conditions : This guideline addresses the fol lowing Foot Foot Disorders 20 C.1 Achilles Tendinopathy Achilles tendon disorders, including Achilles tendinitis, tendinosis, or tendinopathy, are painful conditions affecting the Achilles tendon, which is the largest and strongest tendon in the body, connecting the soleus, and gastrocnemius muscles in the leg to the heel at the calcaneus bone. The Achilles tendon plantar flexes the ankle and facilitates walking. Achilles tendon dis orders can make walking difficult. For each of the Achilles tendon disorders causing pain, the initial management is non - operative. It is believed that early intervention is critical, as management becomes more complicated and less predictable when the co nditions become chronic. C.1.a Diagnostic Studies Although diagnosing of non -rupture Achilles disorders is largely based on a careful history and examination, diagnostic imaging may be required to verify a clinical suspicion or to exclude other musculoskeletal disorders. C.1.a.i X-ray for Diagnosis of Achilles Tendon Disorders, Retrocalcaneal Bursitis, or Blunt Trauma or Suspected Fracture Recommended - for diagnosing insertional Achilles tendon disorders or retrocalcaneal bursitis or evaluating blunt trauma or suspected fracture. Rationale for Recommendation : Radiography is poor at diagnosing soft - tissue disorders, and in the absence of trauma or suspected fracture, is not indicated as a first -line diagnostic tool for mid -portion te ndon disorders. X -ray may reveal calcaneal spur, prominent posterior calcaneal tuberosity, or ossification of the Achilles tendon. For other Achilles disorders, ultrasound or MRI are more effective. Therefore, plain radiographic film studies are recommende d only for insertional Achilles tendinopathy or traumatic injury. C.1.a.ii Ultrasound for Di agnosis of Achilles Tendinopath y Recommended - for diagnosing Achilles tendinopathy and may be particularly useful for differentiation of paratenonitis and tendinosis and for identifying fluid in the retrocalcaneal bursa. Rationale for Recommendation : Ultrasound is frequently used to diagnose midportion tendinopathy . C.1.a.iii Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI) for Diagnosis of Achilles Tendinopathy Recommended - for evaluating Achilles tendinopathies including paratendonitis, tendinosis, and retrocalcaneal bursitis. Rationale for Recommendation : MRI can demonstrate thickened paratenon with adhesions and offers extensive information on the internal structure of the tendon and surrounding tissues. MRI may be NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 21 helpful in differentiating inflammatory from degenerative changes in soft tissue. C.1.a.iv CT for Diagnosis of Achilles Tendinopathy Not Recommended - for diagnosing Achilles tendinopathy. Rationale for Recommendation : CT is not helpful in differentiating inflammatory from degenerative changes in soft tissue. As CT has limitations when compared to MRI , it is not recommended. C.1.b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ) are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests ac etaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.1.b.i Non-steroidal Anti (NSAIDs) Treatment Subacute, Chronic , or Post -operative Achilles Tendinopathy Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, or post - operative Achilles tendinopathy pain. Indications : For acute, subacute, chronic, or post -operative Achilles tendinopathy, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the- counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of foot/ankle pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.1.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profil e who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigare tte smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 22 manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointesti nal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.1.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse effects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the ben eficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs and Acetaminophen C.1.b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic Achilles Tendinopathy Pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs.

NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 25 Evidence for the Use of Night Splinting for Achilles Tendinopathy C.1.c.iii Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work - related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury st atus in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are depe ndent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized ove r passive interventions. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.1.c.iii.a Therapeutic Exercise - Physical / Occupational Therapy Recommended to improve function, including range of motion and strength . Frequency/Dose/Duration : Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilita tion plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of achilles tendinopathy pain, intolerance, lack of efficacy or noncompliance . Evidence for the Use of Exercise for Achilles Tendinopathy C.1.c.iii.b Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy for Chronic Mid - portion Achill es Tendinopathy NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 26 Recommended - as an adjunct to an eccentric exercise for chronic, recalcitrant Achilles tendinopathy .

Patients should generally have failed NSAID(s), eccentric exercises, iontophoresis, inject ion(s) and low level laser therapy. C.1.c.v.b Surgery for the Treatment of Acute or Subacute Achilles Tendinopathy Without Rupture Not Recommended - for acute or subacute Achilles tendinopathy without rupture. Rationale for Recommendations : Surgery is not recommended until a course of at least six months of other non-operative treatments with out demonstrated efficacy has been attempted and the patient's symptoms are sufficient to warrant the risks of surgical intervention. C.1.c.vi Other C.1.c.vi.a Orthotic Devices (Such as Heel Lifts, Heel Pads or Heel Braces) for Acute, Subacute, Chronic, or Postoperative Achilles Tendinopathy Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Evidence for the Use of Orthotic Devices for Achilles Tendinopathy C.2 Achilles Tendon Rupture The cardinal symptom of an Achilles tendon rupture is a sudden pain in the posterior heel that is often accompanied by a \"pop\" heard emanating from the heel. There is generally no history of prior symptoms (pain, stiffness) prior to rupture. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 31 Diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture is most often based on loss of plantar flexion strength , palpation of a gap in the -portion of the tendon (proximal to the calcaneal insertion), and a positive squeeze test of the calf muscle that fails to elicit plantar flexion. Specific imaging is not required for most acute rupture cases. There are no other spec ific diagnostic criteria for Achilles tendon rupture. Acute rupture refers to rupture that presents for evaluation within four weeks, whereas chronic rupture refers to ruptures that present for evaluation four to six weeks or more after an acute injury. Upon establishment of the diagnosis, initial treatment is symptomatic until the definitive care plan is established. This may include immobilization, relative rest, NSAIDs, acetaminophen and cryotherapy. C.2.a Diagnostic Studies Diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture is generally made through clinical history and physical examination findings . X-ray is generally not used for the diagnosis of acute Achilles rupture, although it may be helpful in identifying tendon calcification. C.2.a.i Routine X -ray for Diagnosis of Acute Achilles Rupture Not Recommended - to diagnose acute Achilles tendon rupture. Indications : Achilles tendon ruptures resulting from direct trauma or if suspected rupture involves the calcaneal insertion, or among patients with reasonable suspicion of tendon calcification. Ruptures of the tendon at the calcaneal insertion are reported to be rare, although if suspected radiography may detect avulsion of the bony insertion. C.2.a.ii Ultrasound for Diagnosis of Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture Recommended - for the diagnosis of acute Achilles tendon rupture. Indications : Clinical suspicion of rupture is high but uncertain. Rationale for Recommendation : It is recommended as the main confirmatory diagnostic test for Achilles ruptures, particularly when there is diagnostic uncertainty. C.2.a.iii MRI for Diagnosis of Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture Recommended - for the evaluation of acute Achilles tendon rupture. Indications : Clinical suspicion of rupture is high but uncertain. Rationale for Recommendation : MRI is recommended for select use as an alternative when clinical suspicion for rupture is high . It is sometimes used to evaluate the Achilles tendon parti cularly where there is diagnostic uncertainty, although ultrasound has been generally preferred. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 32 C.2.b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective.

C.2.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended concomminent use of cytoprotective classes Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump in hibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.2.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have t he risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 33 Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at le ast 30 minutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. C.2.b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Achilles Rupture Pain Recommended for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic Achilles rupture pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs.

C.2.b.v Opioids for Pain from Acute or Postoperative Achilles Tendon Repair Recommended limited use of opioids (not to exceed seven days) for the treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture is a treatment option for select patients presenting with acute or moderate to severe pain related to Achilles rupture. Limited use of opioids for a few days (not to exceed seven days) is also recommended for select patients w ho have undergone recent Achilles tendon repair or those who encountered surgical complications. Indications: Acute rupture or postoperative pain management for patients with moderate to severe pain. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Frequency and dose per manufacturer's recommendations; may be taken scheduled or as needed; generally taken for short courses of a few days, with subsequent weaning to nocturnal use if needed, then discontinuation. Total length of treatment usually ranges from a few days to one week . Generally should be utilized to supplement pain relief in addition to an NSAID or acetaminophen to reduce total need for opioid and the consequent adverse effects. Indications for Discontinuation : Sufficient pain management with other methods such as NSAIDs, resolution of pain, intolerance, adverse effects, lack of benefits, or failure to progress over a couple weeks. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 34 Rationale for Recommendations: Opioids are recommended for brief select use in postoperative patients with primary use at night to facilitate adequate postoperative sleep C.2.b.vi Opioids for Pain from Subacute or Chronic Achilles Tendon Repair Not Recommended for treatment of pain from subacute or chronic Achilles tendon repair. Rationale for Recommendation: Opioids are not recommended for routine use. C.2.b.vii Prophylaxis for Prevention of Deep Venous Thrombosis Recommended - for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis. Indications - Patients with predisposing risks for developing venous thrombosis events. High -risk populations are not well defined currently, and therefore require a high degree of physician and patient judgment. A low threshold for prophylaxis may be appropriate for patients with prior history of thrombolic and thromboembolic events, delayed rehabilitation or ambulation, obesity, diabetes, or other coagulation disorders. C.2.b.viii Thrombosis Prophylaxis for Prevention of Deep Venous Thrombosis Not Recommended to prevent deep venous thrombosis.

Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adju nctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.2.c.ii.a Therapeutic Exercise - Physical / Occupational Therapy Recommended - to improve function, including range of motion and strength. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Frequency of visits is usually individualized based on severity of the limitation. Two to three visits per week for two weeks are often used to initiate an exercise program. Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for mild patients or up to 12 to 15 with documentation of objective functional improvement. As part of the rehabilitation plan, patients should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapy, at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement. Indications : All postoperative and conservatively managed Achilles rupture patients. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, intolerance, lac k of efficacy or noncompliance . C.2.c.ii.b Postoperative TENS for Achilles Tendon Repair NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 36 Not Recommended - as a postoperative treatment for Achilles tendon rupture. Rationale for Recommendation : There is no defined benefit of TENS for promoting the healing process . C.2.c.iii Surgery C.2.c.iii.a Surgery for Treatment of Achilles Tendon Rupture Recommended - for treatment of ruptured Achilles tendon. The mixed results of the data supporting operative and non - operative care should be discussed with patients when covering treatment options. Discussion should include the equivocal superior ity of surgical compared to non-operative treatment . C.2.c.iii.b Non-Operative Management of Achilles Tendon Rupture with Functional Splinting and Casting Recommended - for Achilles tendon rupture. Non-operative management may be indicated in many cases, particularly for select patients with low physical demands where risk factors may outweigh benefits. Evidence for the Use of Non -operative and Surgical Repair for Achilles Tendon Rupture Surgical Repair - Open and Percutaneous Methods Surgical repairs have included two basic approaches - open and percutaneous methods. C.2.c.iii.c Open and Percutaneous Operative Approaches Recommended - for patients undergoing operative repair. There is no recommendation of one approach over the other.

Indications: All postoperative Achilles tendon repairs. Frequency/Duration : Apply zero to two weeks postoperative . Indications for Discontinuation : Discomfort, noncompliance , device intolerance. Evidence for the Use of Postoperative Management for Achilles Tendon Rupture C.3 Ankle Tendinopathies (Other than Achilles Tendinopathy) The ankle's tendinous compartments are susceptible to stenosing tenosynovitis, similar to those of the wrist . They may be affected by disease (e.g., rheumatic disorders, diabetes mellitus, and infectio n) and undergo age-related degenerative changes. Tend on subluxations, dislocations, and tears occur. There are no quality trials addressing ankle tendinopathies other than Achilles tendinopathy . Guidance for these ankle -foot tendon disorders is based on analogies to othe r tendinopathies, particularly of the wrist. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 38 C.4 Tenosynovitis (Including Stenosing Tenosynovitis) Patients with tendinopathy present with localized ankle pain that is augmented by movement. Occassionally, pain may extend along the affected tendon sheath. Initial care usually involves limitation of the physical factors thought to be contributing. Walk ing casts or boots, splints, or braces for tendinoses may be helpful especially in moderate to severe cases. NSAIDs are often prescribed for initial treatment. C.4.a Diagnostic Studies There are no tests that are typically performed for tenosynovitis. X -rays are usually not helpful. Boney deformities may contribute to the tenosynovitis and occult fractures may occur . C.4.b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although mos t evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.4.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory (NSAIDs) for Acute, Subacut e or Chronic Ankle Tenosynovitis Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic ankle tenosynovitis. Indications : For acute, subacute, chronic, or postoperative ankle compartment tenosynovitis, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resol ution of foot/ankle pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.4.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: mi soprostol, sucralfate, histamine t ype 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 39 patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestin al bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding . Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.4.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safe st regarding cardiovascular adverse. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the pote ntial for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs for Compartment Tenosynovitis C.4.b.iv Acetaminophen for Tenosynovitis Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic Achilles Tenosynovitis Pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with foot/ankle pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative . Dose/Frequ ency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. C.4.c Treatments C.4.c.i Mobilization / Immobilization C.4.c.i.a Walking Boots, Casts, Splints, and Braces for Acute and Subacute Ankle Tenosynovitis Recommended - for treatment of acute and subacute ankle tendinoses. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 40 Indications : Patients with tendinosis. Frequency/Duration: Worn while ambulating. Indications for Discontinuation: Failure to respond or resolution. C.4.c.ii Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work - related injury should be fo cused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventi ons. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into th e rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.4.c.ii.a Therapy to Address Residual Deficits, Particularly Postoperative ly Recommended - for the treatment of residual deficiits associated with acute, subacute, chronic, or postoperative tenosynovitis. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improveme nt. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activitie s). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, intolerance, lac k of efficacy or noncompliance . NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 41 C.4.c.ii.b Other Non -Operative Interventions Including Manipulation and Mobilization, Massage, Deep Friction Massage, or Acupuncture for Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Ankle Tenosynovitis Not Recommended - for the treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic ankle tenosynovitis. C.4.c.ii.c Iontophoresis for Acute and Subacute Ankle Tenosynovitis Recommended - for ankle tenosynovitis using glucocorticosteroids and sometimes NSAIDs. Indications : Patients with ankle tendinosis . Generally those who either fail to respond adequately to NSAIDs, splints, and activity modifications or decline injection. Dose: Glucocorticosteroid is generally used . Frequency/Duration: Generally two to three treatments to ascertain efficacy; an additional four to six treatments may be scheduled if efficacious. If improvements continue at six appointments, an additional four to six treatments are reasonable . Indications for Discontinuation: Failure to respond, developme nt of adverse effects, resolution. Rationale for Recommendation : Iontophoresis with either a glucocorticoid or NSAID is recommended for select patients who fail to respond to other treatments or who decline injection. C.4.c.ii i Injection Therapy C.4.c.iii.a Glucocorticosteroid Injections for Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Ankle Tendinosis Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic ankle tendinosis. Indications : Ankle symptoms of pain over a compartment. Generally, at least one week of non -invasive treatment to determine if condition will resolve without invasive treatment. It is reasonable to treat cases with an initial injection . An adjuvant injectable anesthet ic is typically used. Frequency/Duration: It is recommended that a single injection be scheduled, and the results evaluated to document improvement . Failure of a response within one to two week s should result in reanalysis of the diagnosis and NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 42 consideration of repeat injection . Recurrence of symptoms months later should result in consideration of re -injection. Repeat injections can be considered when there is decreased pain and increased function from the previous injection. More than three injections in a year should be avoided due to tendon weakening and risk of rupture . Recurring injections on a year after year basis should also be similarly avoided . Indications for Discontinuation: If a partial response, consideration should be given to repeating the injection, typically at a modestly higher dose. Evidence for the Use of Glucocorticosteroid Injections for Ankle Tendinoses C.4.c. iv Surgery C.4.c.iv.a Surgical Release for Subacute or Chronic Ankle Tenosynovitis Not Recommended - for patients with subacute or chronic ankle tenosynovitis who fail to respond to non -operative interventions including injections . C.5 Plantar Heel Pain (\"Plantar Fasciitis\") Heel pain is the most common area of pain in the foot . Plantar heel pain , known as \"plantar fasciitis,\" is common. Other names for plantar heel pain include painful heel syndrome, heel spur syndrome, runner's heel, arked pain in the inferior or plantar aspect of either the center or medial heel . Pain may be reported distal towards the arch of the foot. As noted, it is most noticeable during weight -bearing activities, especially the first weight -bearing step of the d ay or after periods of sitting or recumbency. Plantar fasciitis generally responds well to conservative management, with more than 90% of patients resolving over a six to 12 month period with non -surgical intervention. Initial management of plantar heel pain is non -invasive. More than 90% of plantar heel pain will resolve with non -invasive measures over a six to 12 month period . Possibly, the most important non -operative treatment is reassuring the patient that 95% of t hose with plantar fasciitis will have resolution of symptoms in 12 to 18 months. Plantar Fasciitis Diagnostic Criteria (Appendix D.2 - Table 3) C.5.a Diagnostic Studies Imaging plays a limited role in routine clinical practice and is generally reserved for select cases to rule out other causes of heel pain or to establish the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis when it is in doubt. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 43 Plain radiographs are utilized for diagnosi ng plantar fasciitis. C.5.a.i Use of X -Ray for Diagnosis of Plantar Heel Pain Recommended - for diagnosing suspected fracture in patients with plantar heel pain . Indication: Evaluation of plantar heel pain when calcaneal fracture or osseous tumor is suspected, or to rule out other causes of heel pain . Plain films should not be obtained solely to identify the presence of heel spurs . C.5.a.ii MRI for Diagnosis of Select Patients with Plantar Fasciitis Recommended - for the evaluation of select patients with plantar fasciitis. Indications: Suspected plantar fascial rupture, avascular necrosis of talar dome, and stress fracture of the talar neck particularly if heel pain is not improving. Rationale for Recommend ation : MRI may be useful in the diagnosis of causes of heel pain other than plantar fasciitis, including calcaneal stress fracture, plantar calcaneal spurs, avascular necrosis of talar dome, joint fluid, ganglion cyst, s tress fracture of the talar neck, and osseous tumors. Evidence for the Use of MRI for Plantar Fasciitis C.5.a.i ii SPECT -CT for Diagnosis of Plantar Fasciitis Not Recommended - for the diagnosis of plantar heel pain. C.5.a.iv Ultrasound for Diagnosis of Plantar Fasciitis Recommended - for the evaluation of select patients with plantar fasciitis. Indications : Evaluation of plantar heel pain when clinical diagnosis is uncertain or after no improvement from a course of conservative treatment of four to six weeks. Rationale for Recommendation: is recommended for cases of suspected plantar fascial rupture or plan tar calcaneal bursitis if symptoms are not resolved after a trial of non -invasive therapy. C.5.b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 44 suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.5.b.i Non-steroidal Chronic, or Postoperative Plantar Fasc iitis Pain Recommended - treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, or postoperative plantar fascitis pain. Indications : postoperative plantar fasciitis pain , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of foot/ankle pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.5.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - concom itant use of cytoprotective Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also h ave indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleedin g. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.5.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse. Recommended - If nee ded, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 45 minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. C.5.b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Plantar Fasciitis Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic Plantar Fasciitis Pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with foot/ankle pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative . Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis.

Indications: Postoperative pain management. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Frequency and per manufacturer's recommendations; may be taken as sche duled or as needed. Generally suggested to be taken for short courses (a few days), with subsequent weaning to nocturnal use if needed, then discontinued. Indications for Discontinuation : Sufficient pain management with other methods such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen, resolution of pain, intolerance, adverse effects, lack of benefits, or failure to progress. Rationale for Recommendations : There is no quality evidence for the use of opioids for the treatment of acute, subacute , or chronic pla ntar heel pain. The vast majority of patients with plantar fasciitis generally do NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 46 not have pain sufficient to merit trialing with the risks of opioids. They are not recommended for routine use. Some patients may have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids in the immediate postoperative period may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief select use in postoperative patients with primary use at night to achieve postoperative sleep while not i mpairing early rehabilitation. Evidence for the Use of Opioids for Plantar Fasciitis C.5.b.viii Oral or Intramuscular Glucocorticosteroids for Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Plantar Heel Pain Not Recommended - for the treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic plantar heel pain. Rationale for Recommendation : As evidence is lacking and evidence of efficacy is present for several other treatments, the use of glucocorticosteroids by oral or intramuscular routes is not recommended.

NYS WCB MTG - Ankle Acetaminopthen and/or non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drug s (NSAID s) for pain control are often not needed due to the propensity for the join to be denervated, but if needed are recommended. For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.8.b.i Chr onic, or Postoperative Charcot Joint Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, or postoperative Charcot Joint pain. Indications : For acute, subacute, chronic, or postoperative Charcot Joint pain, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first.

Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of foot/ankle pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.8.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers . Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleedi ng Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 61 C.8.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse. Recomm ended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficia l effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. C.8.b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Charcot Joint Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic Charcot Joint Pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs.

There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. C.8.c Treatments C.8.c.i Rehabilitation Therapy Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work - related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasibl e. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivere d by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 62 The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels.

C.10 Foot Drop Foot drop is a weakness in the dorsiflexion strength of the affected lower extremity resulting in an abnormal gait pattern. Foot drop is most commonly caused by a variety of central and peripheral nervous system disorders, although any disorder affecting muscle strength may cause foot drop. Foot drop results in an abnormal gait pattern most often because the ankle of t he weak side cannot undergo voluntary dorsiflexion. The acute onset of foot drop after ipsilateral leg trauma may be a manifestation of compartment syndrome . Acute cases of foot drop are urgencies if not emergencies due to the potential for significant enduring impairments . Acute trauma followed by foot drop and lower leg pain may mark compartment syndrome ,which is one of the surgical emergent causes of foot drop. C.10. a Diagnostic Studies Diagnostic studies to determine the cause of foot drop most often include MRI of the brain, spinal cord and/or MRI of the periphery and electrodiagnostic studies of the peripheral nerves as clinically indicated . C.10. a.i Diagnostic Studies for Diagnosis of Foot Drop Recommended - to determine cause of foo t drop (see General Principles A. 12 - Diagnostic Imaging and Testing Procedrues) .

Evidence for the U se of Taping C.10. b.ii Other C.10. b.ii.a Ankle -foot Orthotics for Treatment of Foot Drop Recommended - for the treatment of foot drop. Evidence for use of Orthotics C.11 Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome (TTS) Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome (TTS) is a relatively infrequent condition defined as an entrapment neuropathy of the tibial nerve or one of its branches from its entry point under the flexor retinaculum below the medial malleolus to the end of its lateral and medial plantar and posterior calcaneal branches, which innervate the base of the foot. TTS is NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 67 described by the constellation of symptoms of intermittent tingling, numbness or burning paresthesias in the toes and the plantar surface of the foot. In the absence of neuropathi c findings (sensory or motor involvement) four to six weeks of conservative care before using invasive measures may be reasonable. The commonly prescribed conservative measures are intended to relieve pressure and pain. These include cold, taping, exercise s (especially posterior tibial nerve stretching), anti - inflammatory medications, splints, orthotic devices and supportive footwear. There are no well-established standard diagnostic criteria for TTS. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for TTS in patients presenting with pain and paresthesias of the plantar foot that worsen with prolonged standing and walking, or cause interruption of sleep. C.11 .a Diagnostic Studies C.11. a.i Nerve Conduction Studies ( NCS ) for Diagnosis and Pre -operative Assessment of TTS Patients Recommended - for confirming the diagnosis of entrapment of the tibial nerve at the ankle for cases that do not improve with conservative treatment or if considering surgical release after excluding the possibility of other causes such as polyneuropathy and radiculopathy. C.11. a.ii NCS for Initial Evaluation of TTS Patients Not Recommended - for the initial evaluation and most TTS patients as NCS do es not change the management of the condition during the first four to six weeks while conservative therapy is being tried. C.11. a.iii Electromyography ( EMG ) for Initial Evaluation, Diagnosis or Pre - operative Asse ssment of TTS Patients Not Recommended - for initial evaluation, diagnosis or pre -operative assessment of TTS patients. Electromyography (as distinguished from a nerve conduction study) is not generally recommended as there is no quality evidence demonstrating the utility of EMG in the diagnosis of TTS. Rationale for Recommendations : NCS is recommended for diagnosis of entrapment of the tibial nerve at the ankle and for pre -operative assessment , but is not recommended for initial evaluation and most TTS patients. C.11. a.iv MRI for Diagnosis of TTS Recommended - for the diagnosis of select cases of clinically suspected TTS that has failed conservative management or if a mass lesion is suspected. C.11. a.v MRI to Diagnose TTS Not Recommended - for the initial evaluation of TTS. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 68 C.11. a.vi Use of Ultrasound as an Aid to NCS Recommended - as an aid to NCS as it may be beneficial to identify suspected space occupying lesions in the tarsal tunnel after failed conservative management, or as an adjunct to guide interventional therapies. C.11. a.vii Routine U se of Diagnostic Ultrasound Not Recommended - as a r outine diagnostic test for TTS. Rational for Recommendations : The routine use of ultrasound for initial evaluation is not recommended. Ultrasound studies should be reserved for patients that have failed conservative therapy . Use as an adjunct to guide interventional therapies may be useful. C.11. b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less Drugs (NSAIDs) and Acetaminophen for TTS Pain Recommended - for treatment of TTS Indications : For TTS Pain, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of foot/ankle pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.11. b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 69 patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers . Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevent ion of gastrointestinal bleedi ng. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID.

C.11. b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of TTS Pain Recommended - for treatment of TTS Pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients TTS pain. Acetaminophen may provide enough mild analgesic relief to allow the patient to exercise or function at a higher level . Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. C.11. b.v Oral Systemic Glucocorticosteroids for Treatment of TTS Recommended - for treatment of TTS patients who decline tarsal tunnel injection. Indications - Tarsal tunnel syndrome unresponsive to splinting. Most patients should be injected rather than given oral steroids . However, among those declining injection, oral glucocorticosteroids may be warranted. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 70 Frequency/Dose: It is recommended that one course (10 to 14 days) of oral glucocorticosteroid be prescribed, rather than repeated courses. Prescriptions of low rather than high doses are recommended to minimize potential for adverse effects. Opioids Opioids have occasionally been used to treat patients with TTS. These medications have primarily been used for a f ew nights in the post -surgical period (see Non Acute Pain Guideline) . C.11.b.v i Routine Use of Opioids for Treatment of Pain from TTS Not Recommended - for treatment of patients with pain from TTS. Rationale for Recommendations: The vast majority of patients with TTS do not have pain of suff icient intensity to require opioids. Patients having such degrees of pain should generally have investigations performed for alternative diagnoses. They are not recommended for routine use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in postoperative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep postoperative ly. C.11. b.vii Opioids for Pain Treatment of TTS in Select Patients Post Op Recommended - limited use (not more than seven days) for select patients Indications: Patients who have und ergone recent tarsal tunnel release and have large incisions or encountered significant complications and whose pain cannot be managed with other means. Evidence for the Use of Opioids for TTS C.11. b.viii Diuretics for Routine Treatment of TTS Not Recommended - for routine treatment of TTS. Rationale for Recommendatio n: Most of the medical conditions described as risk factors for TTS do not involve edema or swelling of the lower extremities. C.11. b.ix Vitamins , Including Pyridoxine Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS in patients without vitamin deficiencies. C.11. b.x Lidocaine Patches for Treatment of TTS Recommended - for treatment of select cases of TTS. Indications : Patients with moderate to severe TTS with pain as a central complaint and in whom other treatable causes of the pain have been NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 71 eliminated. Generally should have previously been treated with likely more efficacious treatment strategies. Frequency/Duration : Per manufacturer's recommendation. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution, intolerance, adverse effects, lack of benefits, or failure to progress over a trial of at least a couple weeks. C.11. c Treatments C.11. c.i Cyrotherapy / Heat C.11. c.i.a Self-application of Ice or Heat for Treatment of TTS Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. Rationale for Recommendations : Ice and heat may help particularily with more acute symptoms . C.11. c.ii Mobilization / Immobilization C.11. c.ii.a Nocturnal Treatment of TTS Not Recommended - nocturnal splinting for treatment of TTS. C.11. c.iii Rehabilitation Therapy Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work - related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker t o pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task.

NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 72 Assistive devices may be included as an adju nctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.11. c.iii.a Rest for Treatment of More Symptomatic Cases of TTS Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. Rationale for Recommendations : Ankle rest may be beneficial for the more symptomatic cases where aggrevating factors include constant standing or walking. C.11. c.iii.b Exercise Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. Rationale for Recommendation : Exercise regimens for tendon gliding or nerve gliding may be appropriate with documentation of improved function and decreased pain. C.11. c.iii.c Taping Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. C.11. c.iii.d Magnets Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. C.11. c.iii.e Acupuncture Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. Rationale for Recommendation : There are other interventions with documented efficacy. Therefore, the use of acupuncture for treatment of TTS is not recommended . C.11. c.iii.f Manipulation and Mobilization of the Distal Lower Extremity Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. C.11. c.iii.g Ultrasound Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS C.11. c.iii.h Iontophoresis Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. Rationale for Recommendation : Other treatments have documented efficacy and should be used preferentially. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 73 C.11. c.iii.i Phonophoresis Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. Rationale for Recommendatio n: Other treatments have documented efficacy and should be used preferentially. Evidence for the Use of Phonophoresis C.11. c.iv Injection Therapy C.11 .c.iv.a Glucocorticosteroid Injections Recommended - as part of a conservative management strategy for treatment of TTS. Rationale for Recommendation : Injections are commonly reported as part of conservative therapy and as an additional mode for confirmation of suspected diagnosis of TSS. Thus, if a more conservative treatment strategy fails to improve the condition, glucocorticosteroid injections may be useful. C.11. c.iv.b Insulin Injections Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS. C.11. c.iv.c Botulinum Injections Not Recommended - for the treatment of TTS C.11. c.v Surgery C.11. c.v.a Surgical Release for Space Occupying Lesion Recommended - Surgical release of posterior tibial nerve impingement at the tarsal tunnel upon failure of conservative treatment and in the presence of space occupying lesion. Surgical release for cases with nonspecific causes are otherwise expected to have mixed results and patients should be counseled regarding potential lack of benefit before consideration of surgery. C.11. c.vi Other C.11. c.vi.a Orthotics for Treatment of Select Patients with TTS Recommended - selectively for those with TTS thought to be of biomechanical origin . NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 74 C.12 Ankle Sprain Injuries to the ankle are common and are a frequent reason for seeking acute care. Ankle sprain injuries involve tear of one or more ligaments in any of the three ligament groups. The majority of ankle sprains involve only the lateral ligaments, with approximately 15% involving the medial ankle. The natural course of the lateral ankle sprain is rapid improvement. Ten to 20% of p atients with acute ankle sprain may develop chronic ankle instability . Classification systems for lateral ankle sprain severity are based on physical examination findings and are used to define the extent of ligament injury. Sprain : Injury, not necessarily permanent, of a ligament. S, Grade I: overstretching or slight tearing without instability. S, Grade II: incomplete tearing. S, Grade III: complete tear or rupture. Red flags , including fracture, should be considered. C.12. a Diagnostic Studi es C.12 .a.i Routine Use of Arthrography in Diagnosis of Acute , Subacute or Chronic Ankle Sprain Not Recommended - for evaluation of acute , subacute or chronic ankle sprain. Rationale for Recommendations : Arthrography is invasive, is associated with adverse effects including risks from dye and post -procedure pain. MRI, CT, and ultrasound have essentially replaced plain arthrography in current practice. C.12. a.ii X-Ray in Assessment of Acute Ankle Sprain When Fracture is Not Suspected Not Recommended - for evaluation of acute ankle sprain when fracture is not suspected. C.12. a.iii X-Ray in Assessment of Acute Ankle Sprain When Fracture is Suspected Recommended - if fracture is likely and the differential diagnosis reflects suspicion of fracture. Rationale for Recommendations : The primary purpose of obtaining radiologic imaging for the acute ankle injury is to evaluate for the presence of ankle or foot fractures. Ankle fracture occurs in approximately 15% of patients with a nkle sprain. Indications : Suspicion of fracture or if the history or physical is clinically suspicious for an injury other than an ankle sprain. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 75 Views : Anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise radiographs should be obtained. C.12. a.iv Routine Stress X -Ray for Evaluation of Ligame nt Rupture in Acute Ankle Sprain Not Recommended - for evaluation of acute ankle ligament rupture. C.12. a.v Routine Stress X -Ray for Evaluation of Ligament Rupture in Subacute or Chronic Ankle Sprain Not Recommended - for evaluation of subacute or chronic ankle pain. Rationale for Recommendations : Plain films are not required for the diagnosis of acute ankle sprain as x -ray is poor at diagnosing soft -tissue disorders. The use of plain film x -ray rather is utilized for evaluation of accompanying ankle or foot fracture, orientation of fracture plane(s), and magnitude of the involvement of the articular surfaces, which if present may alter management in favor of surgery. X -ray is indicated based on high clinical suspicion. Therefore, x -ray is recommended for assessment of suspected ankle or foot fracture. Evidence for the Use of X -ray for Evaluation of Ankle Fractures C.12. a.vi CT for Assessment of Subacute or Chronic Ankle Sprain Recommended - for the assessment of select patients with subacute or chronic ankle sprain. Indications - Patients who have no improvement with non -operative therapy after four to six weeks, persistent pain with weight bearing, or chronic feeling of instability; ankle injuries that involve crepitus, catching or locking, as these symptoms may be associated with a displaced osteochondral fragment.

C.12.a.xv Electrodiagnostic Studies of the Peroneal Nerve Recommended - for select patients with recurrent / recalcentrant lateral sprains . Indications -To rule out peroneal neuropath in Patients with Lateral sprains as a result of marked inversion injury . C.12. b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. NYS WCB MTG - Disorders b.i for Trea tment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Sprain Injury Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute or chronic ankle sprain injury pain, particularly in patients contraindications for non- steroidal anti -inflammatory ( NSAIDs ). All including acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative . Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. C.12. b.ii Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, Chronic Ankle Sprain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, or postoperative Ankle Sprain . Indications : For ankle sprain pain , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for D iscontinuation: Resolution of foot/ankle pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.12. b.iii NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointesti nal Bleeding Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers .

C.12. b.iv NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. Evidence for the Use of Acetaminophen for Ankle Spr ain Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs for Ankle Sprain C.12. b.v Opioids for Select Acute or Postoperative Ankle Sprain Recommended - for no more than one week for select patients with severe pain related to acute ankle sprain. Limited use of opioids for no more than one week may be indicated for those that have undergone ankle ligament repair surgery or those who encountered surgical complications. Indica tion: Highly selective use. Severe pain with acute ankle sprain and postoperative pain management. Generally to be used only with either demonstrated insufficient control of pain with NSAID or severe sprain/ postoperative pain. Frequency /Dose /Duration : Frequency and dose per manufacturer's recommendations ; may be taken scheduled or as needed; generally suggested to be taken for short courses of a few days . Indications for Discontinuation : Sufficient pain management with other methods such a s NSAIDs, resolution of pain, intolerance, adverse effects, lack of benefits, or failure to progress over a couple weeks. Rationale for Recommendation : The vast majority of patients with ankle sprain generally do not have pain sufficient to require opi oids. Some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief select use in postoperative patients primar ily at night to achieve postoperative sleep.

Evidence for the Use of Heat for Ankle Sprain C.12.c. iii Immobilization C.12. c.iii.a Ankle Brace (Orthosis) for Acute Ankle Sprain Recommended - for treatment of acute ankle sprain with optional use as needed by the patient for mild and moderate sprains. Evidence for the Use of A nkle Brace Support (Pneumatic/Gel) for Ankle Sprain Evidence for the Use of Ankle Support or Brace for Ankle Sprain C.12. c.iii.b Walking Boot for Acute Ankle Sprain Not Recommended - of acute ankle sprains. C.12. c.iii.c Walking Boot for Select Cases of Severe Ankle Sprain Recommended - for select cases of severe ankle sprains. Evidence for the Use of Walking Boots for Ankle Sprain C.12. c.iii.d Early Mobilization for Acute Ankle Sprain NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 81 Recommended - for acute ankle sprains without fracture. Indications : Acute ankle sprains (severe sprains should undergo no more than three weeks of immobilization, splints should be sufficient for immobilization ; ankle sprains that are mild or moderate should not undergo immobilization. Rationale for Recommendations : Early mobilization is recommended over immobilization for most patients C.12.c.iii.e Immobilization for Acute Mild to Moderate Ankle Sprain Not Recommended - for patients with acute mild to moderate ankle sprain as splints should be sufficient. Rationale for Recommendation: Mild acute sprains are generally self -limited and respond well to early mobilization and other therapies; therefore, casting is not recommended. C.12. c.iii.f Immobilization for Severe Ankle Sprain Recommended - splinting for immobilization for severe ankle sprain. Indications : Severe ankle sprain. Frequency/Duration : Application of a splint for ten days to three weeks after a 48 hour period of elevation and non - weight bearing. Rationale for Recommendation : Casting is restrictive of activity, including return to work, impairs driving performance more than bracing, and is associated with risk for deep venous thrombosis. Cast immobilization is therefore not recommended . Splinting is recommended for immobilization of severe ankle sprain. Evidence for the Use of Ear ly Mobilization for Ankle Sprain C.12.c. iv Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work - related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasibl e. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant att ainment of objective functional NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 82 gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maint ain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.12.c.iv.a Therapy - Active Therapeutic Exercise Recommended - for select patients with a cute, subacute or chronic ankle sprain Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy.

C.12. c.vii.b Surgery for Treatment of Chronic Ankle Instability (CAI) Recommended - for select cases of chronic ankle instability. Indications: Chronic ankle instability of at least three months duration, lateral ankle ligament laxity, and failure of non-operative therapies including therapy and use of ankle orthosis. Rationale for Recommendations : Persistent functional instability of a chronic nature may be considered for ligament reconstruction. Evidence for the use of Surgical Intervention for Chronic Ankle Instability Evidence for the Use of Acute Surgical Repair for Ankle Ligament Tear C.12. c.vii.c Postoperative Management of Ankle Instability Recommended - Short -term cast immobilization with early mobilization and therapy for ankle instability. Rationale for Recommendation: Immobilization or early motion and therapy are described as frequent postoperative management techniques. Evidence for the Use of Postoperative Management for Ankle Instability C.13 Mid-Tarsus Pain and Sprains Mid-tarsus or mid -foot pai n and sprains frequently involve the ligaments of the mid -foot. A primary diagnostic focus is to eliminate the diagnosis of midfoot fracture. Metatarsalgia is included in this category as is metatarsophalangeal joint sprain. However, metatarsalgia is a bro ad categorization of forefoot pain that also includes numerous other conditions (e.g., Morton's neuroma ). NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 88 C.13.a D iagnostic Studies C.13.a.i Weight Bearing X -Rays Recommended - AP and lateral views without obliques; often bilateral for comparative purposes : Often normal in mild injuries (Grade 1 Sprains) . Generally abnormal in moderate (Grade 2 Sprains) . Always abnormal in severe injuries (Grade 3 Sprains). C.13.a.ii CT Scans Recommended - in uncertain cases and in select pre -operative cases . C.13.b Treatments C.13.b.i Mobilization / Immobilization C.13.b.i .a Inmobilization in a Short-Leg Walking B oot or Cast Recommended - for mild to moderate cases without diastasis . Duration of Therapy - four to six weeks with repeat x -rays and evaluation for stability at two weeks . C.13. b.ii Surgery C.13. b.ii.a Surgery Recommended - for all severe cases, unstable injuries, and those with significant diastasis common neuralgia affecting the web spaces of the toes, typically the third toe. The pain of Morton's Neuroma may be debilitating in cases where patients have difficulty walking or applying pressure on their foot out of fear of pain. The neuroma is associated with a pathology of the plantar digital nerve as it divides at the base of the toes to supply the sides of the toes. There are many different treatments that have been used for Morton's Neuroma such as NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections, ablative procedures , and surgery. A careful history and physical examination is considered t he most important diagnos tic approach and in most cases needs no further diagnostic testing. C.14. a Treatment C.14.a.i Rehabilitation NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 89 C.14. a.i.a Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy Not Recommended - for Morton's Neuroma. Evidence for the Use of Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy for Morton's Neuroma C.14. a.i.b Manipulation or the Distal Lower Extremity for Treatment of Morton's Neuroma Not Recommended - for treatment of Morton's Neuroma. Evidence for the Use of Manipulation and Mobilization C.14. a.ii Injection Therapy C.14. a.ii.a Glucocorticosteroid Recommended - Morton's Neuroma. Indications: select cases where pain and/or debility are significant and changing shoe wear, and/or orthotics fail to sufficiently control symptoms. Rationale fo r Recommendatio n: Up to three injections to attempt to reduce symptoms is a reasonable inter vention to try before surgery. Ongoing injections are not recommended. Evidence for the use of Glucocorticosteroid Injections C.14. a.ii.b Sclerosant Injections Indications: Select cases where pain and/or debility are significant and changing shoe wear, orthotics and glucocorticoid injection(s) fail to sufficiently control symptoms. C.14. and/or Decompression for Morton's Neuroma NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 90 Recommended - where pain and/or debility are significant and changing shoe wear, orthotics and glucocorticoid injection(s) fail to sufficiently control symptoms. Rationale for Recommendation s: Ablative procedures or surgery are recommended in select cases where pain and/or debility are significant and changing shoe wear, orthotics and glucocorticoid injection (s) fail to sufficiently control symptoms. Evidence of the Use of Surgery C.14. a.iv Other C.14. a.iv.a Changes in Shoewear for Treatment Morton's Neuroma Recommended - for treatment of Morton's Neuroma. Indications : Essentially all patients should be advised to wear stiff -soled, wide toe box shoes with a low heel and soft insert. C.14. a.iv.b Orthotics for Treatment of Morton's of Morton's Metatarsal Pads for Treatment - for treatment of Morton's Neuroma. Rationale for Recommendation: An attempt at an orthosis or a metatarsal pad is recommended. Evidence for / Hallux Valgus Hallux valgus (\"bunion\") is lateral deviation of the great toe at the metatarsophalangeal joint with respect to the midline of the body, generally defined as over 14.5 degrees; and occurring in most cases with medial deviation of the first metatarsal. The feet should show valgus deviation of the great toe beyond the first metatarsophalangeal joint. C.15. a Diagnostic Studies A careful history and physical examination is considered the most important diagnos tic approach and in most cases needs no further diagnostic testing for preliminary treatment. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 91 C.15. a.i X-Rays Recommended - to evaluate alternate conditions such as osteoarthrosis, gout and degenerative joint disease. Also, x -rays are useful for measur ing angles and surgical planning.

Evidence of the Use of Surgery C.15. b.iii Other C.15. b.iii.a Orthotics for Treatment of Recommended for treatment of Hallux Valgus. Indications: Use of orthoses for hallux valgus should generally be limited to one of two conditions: 1) There should be demonstrable hyperpronation or radiographic evidence of hyperpronation with a talar flexion angle of 30 degrees or more on a standing study; or 2) th ere should be pain localized to the plantar aspect of the hallux metatarsal head with or without bunion pathology. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 92 Rationale for Recommendation: Orthotics are recommended for those with symptoms insufficiently controlled by changing shoewear when possibl e. Evidence for Use of Orthotics C.16 Hammer Toe Hammer toe syndromes normally occur in the sagittal plane .

Recommended - for treatment of hammer toe. omy, Fusion, and D iaphysectomy) Recommended - for hammer toes with insufficient results from non - operative procedures. C.17 Ankle and Foot Fractures The initial evaluation of a patient with ankle injury should seek to identify conditions that require immediate treatment. These c onditions include open fracture, vascular compromise, compartment syndrome, and joint dislocation. In general, undisplaced or minimally displaced injuries are treated non -operatively, whereas displaced or unstable injuries are treated operatively. Complications of ankle and foot fractures include decreased range of motion, post -traumatic osteoarthritis, pain, persistent pain despite hardware removal, progressive talar instability, and malunions with concomitant syndesmotic widening. The initial t reatment of foot and ankle fractures is dictated by injury type (displaced or stable, open or closed) and by concomitant soft tissue injury. Closed, stable injuries are generally treated non -operatively. Open fractures require emergent debridement and antibiotic prophylaxis. Closed unstable fractures generally require operative management. Management should be initiated for severe swelling, compartment syndrome, and skin integrity breakdown from fracture blisters. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 93 C.17. a Diagnostic Studies C.17. a.i X-Ray for Suspected Acute Ankle Fractures Recommended - as a first -line study. Indications : Suspicion of fracture. Rationale for Recommendation : X-ray is the recommended initial imaging study for suspected fracture. Evidence for the Use of Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules for Ankle Sprain C.17. a.ii MRI for Distal Lower Extremity and Ankle Fractures Recommend ed - for investigation of distal lower extremity and ankle fractures. Indications : For acute or subacute fracture to evaluate soft tissue/ligament trauma in complex displaced or comminuted fracture , or if stability of fracture is uncertain and MRI will guide management decision. Rationale for Recommendation : MRI should not be used as a first -line imaging technique. Upon confirmation of displaced, comminuted, or unstable fracture, MRI may be an important diagnostic technique for the evaluation of suspected injuries of soft tissues related to distal fibular, tibial, and malleolar fractures, such as to the ankle ligament complex, extensor tendons, deltoid ligament, or tibial nerve. MRI is recommended for these select circumstances. Evidence for the Use of MRI for Evaluation of Ankle Fractures C.17. a.iii CT for Diagnosis and Classification of Ankle Fractures Recommended - for investigation of distal lower extremity and ankle fractures. Indications : Suspected occult and complex ankle fractures; to gain greater clarity of fracture displacement. If intraarticular displacement is considered, then axial views are recommended in addition to any coronal views. Rationale for Recommendation : CT should be considered when x -ray images are negative, but on the basis of physical findings, an occult fracture is strongly suspected. CT may also be useful for evaluation of complex comminuted fractures, providing superior depiction of distal tibial articular surface involvement, fragment positioning, and diagnosis of subluxations. Evidence for the Use of CT for Evaluation of Ankle Fractures NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 94 C.17. a.iv Ultrasound Imaging for Diagnosing Ankle Fracture Recommended - for evaluation of soft -tissue injury associated with select displaced fractures or suspected malleolar stress fractures. Indications: Evaluation of soft -tissue injury associated with select displaced fractures to assess stability of fracture, particularly of the deltoid ligaments with medial and bimalleolar fractures, and in detection of suspected occult or stress fractures. Also used for suspected stress fracture of the distal tibia. Rationale for Recommendation : Ultrasound imaging may be a useful adjuvant to clinical assessment of patients with regards to selection for further radiolog ical examination, and is therefore recommended in select patients. Evidence for the Use of Ultrasound for Evaluation of Ankle Fractures C.17. b Medications C.17. b.i Pre-Operative Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Ankle Fractures Recommended - for closed or open ankle fracture surgery. Evidence for the Use of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Ankle Fractures C.17. b.ii Use of Nasal Spray Calcitonin for Post -fracture Not Recommended - for prophylaxis of post -fracture osteopenia. Evidence for the rupture section. Non-Steroidal Anti Drugs (NSAIDs) and Acetaminophen For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.17. b.iv Non-Steroidal Drugs (NSAIDs) for Acute Ank le Fracture Analgesia Recommended - for treatment of pain associated with ankle fracture . NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 95 Indications : For acute, subacute, chronic, or postoperative ankle fracture , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of foot/ankle pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discont inuation. C.17. b.v NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommende d - concomminent use of cytoprotective sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette sm okers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleedin g. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.17. b.vi NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple r isk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effect s of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or eight hours before the daily aspirin. C.17. b.vii Acetaminophen for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Acute Ankle Fracture Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic acute ankle fracture pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 96 Indications : All patients with foot/ankle pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative . Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs and Acetaminophen for Foot and Ankle Fractures C.17. b.viii Limited Use of Opioids for Acute and Postoperative Pain Management Recommended - for limited use (less than seven days) for acute and postoperative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For acute injury and postoperative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatments (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen, elevation, splinting) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for Recommendation : Some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in postoperative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep postop erative ly. Evidence for the Use of Opioids for Foot and Ankle Fractures C.17. b.ix Tetanus Immunization Status for Open Fractures Recommended - updating of tetanus immunization status as necessary. Indications: Wounds that are not clean if more than five years have elapsed since last tetanus immunization. Rationale for Recommendation : As the adverse effects of not immunizing may be fatal, tetanus immunization updating for open wounds is recommended. Wounds that are not clean or burns should require immunization if more than five years since last immunization, rather than ten years. Patients without a completed immunization series of three injections should receive tetanus immune globulin along with immunization. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 97 Evide nce for the Use of Tetanus Immunization for Open Foot and Ankle Fractures C.17. b.x Analgesia for Non -Operative Reduction Ankle Fractures Recommended - for performing non -operative closed reduction of ankle fractures. Rationale for Recommendation : Appropriate technique should be based on factors of physician experience and preference, patient history of intolerance to medications or level of anxiety, and availability of equipment and supplies. Evidence for the Use of Non -operative Reduction Analgesia for Ankle Fractures C.17.c Immobiliza tion C.17. c.i.a Cast Immobilization for Ankle Fractures Recommended - for the management of ankle fractures. Indications: All ankle fractures. Frequency/Duration: Immobilization generally for six to eight weeks. Rationale for Recommendation : Cast immobilization is recommended for all patients and the use is dependent on physician and patient preference. C.17. c.i.b Early Mobilization for Ankle Fractures Recommended - in the management of postoperative and stable non -operative ankle fractures. Indications: Stabilized malleolar fractures with or without surgery and closed ankle fractures with adequate fixation and stabilization. Frequency/Duration: Early mobilization can be started within one to thre e days postoperative ly. Rationale for Recommendation : Early mobilization is recommended for most patients with stable or repaired malleolar ankle fracture. C.17. c.i.c Early Postoperative Weight -bearing for Ankle Fractures Recommended - Early weight -bearing of operatively fixated ankle fractures postoperatively. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 98 Indications: Stabilized malleolar fractures with or without surgery and closed ankle fractures with adequate fixation and stabilization. Rationale for Recommendation : Early weight -bearing may provide improvement in functional recovery short -term, does not appear to result in increased adverse events . Evidence for the Use of Immobilization, Early Mobilization, Early Weight -bearing for Ankle Fractures C.17 .c.ii Rehabilitation C.17. c.ii.a Electrical Stimulation for Prevention of Muscle Atrophy Not Recommended - for prevention of muscle atrophy in ankle and foot fracture management. Evidence for the Use of Electrical Stimulation for Ankle and Foot Fractures C.17. c.ii.b Therapy for Patients with Functional Deficits after Cast Removal Recommended - after cast removal for ankle fractures. C.17. c.ii.c Manual Therapy as Part of a Post -ankle Fracture Rehabilitation Program Recommended - as part of an active post -ankle fracture rehabilitation program. C.17. c.ii.d Passi ve Stretching for Contractures A fter Immobilization of Ankle Fractures Not Recommended - for contractures after immobilization of ankle fractures. Frequency/Dose /Duration : Frequency of visits is usually individualized based on severity of the limitation. Two to three visits per week for two weeks are often used to initiate an exercise program. Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for mild deficits or for mor e severe deficits, up to 12 to 15 with documenation of objective functional improvement. Evidence for the Use of Therapy for Ankle Fractures C.17. c.ii.e Ultrasound to Stimulate Bone Healing for Ankle and Foot Fractures NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 99 Not Recommended - for ankle and foot fracture management. Evidence for the Use of Ultrasound Stimulation for Ankle and Foot Fractures C.17. c.ii.f Hyperbaric Oxygen for the Management of Ankle or Foot Fractures Not Recommended - for management of ankle or foot fractures. Evidence for the Use of Hyperbaric Oxygen for Ankle and Foot Fractures C.17.c. iii Fracture Care Malleolar Ankle Fractures Management of non -displaced and stable fractures has traditionally been non -operative with good results. There is continued debate regarding treatment for particular fractures types that are not clearly stable or unstable. Non -union of the distal fibula fr acture is rare lending support to a trial of conservative management for non -displaced and stable displaced fractures. Reduction failure or delayed union may require surgical intervention. Posterior malleolar fractures are often missed and are highly varia ble. C.17.c.iii.a Immobilization for Non -displaced Ankle Fractures Recommended - for the treatment of non -displaced and reduced stable ankle fractures. C.17.c.iii.b Immobilization and Reduction for Closed Displaced Ankle Fractures Recommended - for select non -comminuted closed displaced ankle fractures. Indications: Non-comminuted closed displaced ankle fractures with post -reduction displacement less than two to three mm and less than 25% posterior malleolus articular surface involvement. C.17.c.iii.c Operative Fixation for Closed Displaced Ankle Fractures Recommended - for unstable closed displaced ankle fractures. Indications: Generally sev ere lateral fracture with medi al malleolar involvement. Comminuted closed displaced ankle fractures with post -reduction displacement more than 2 to 3mm and more than 25% posterior malleolus articular surface involvement NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 100 Rationale for Recommendations : In the absence of severe systemic comorbidities, the resul ts after open reduction and internal fixation of malleolar fractures in patients above and below 60 years of age are nearly identical, while nonoperative treatment of unstable fractures leads to significantly inferior outcomes. Therefore, the general indications for surgery in elderly patients should not differ from those in younger patients. Individual fracture treatment is tailored depending on bone quality, skin conditions, comorbidities and functional demand of the patient. To avoid complications, it is imperative to consider and treat comorbidities such as diabetes and osteoporosis. Evidence for the Management of Malleolar Ankle Fractures Tibial Shaft Fractures (Diaphyseal) C.17.c.iii.d Operative Fixation for Tibial Shaft Fracture (Closed, Diaphyseal) Recommended - for definitive management of displaced tibial shaft fracture. Indications : Displaced, comminuted distal tibial shaft fracture. C.17.c.iii.e Cast Immobilization for Tibial Shaft Fractures (Closed, Diaphyseal) Recommended - case may be indicated in select patients with closed, stable, tibial fracture. Evidence for the Management of Tibial Shaft Fractures Distal Tibial Extra -Articular Fractures C.17.c.iii.f Operative Fixation (i.e., Fracture Plating, Intramedullary Nail) for Distal Tibial Extra -Articular Fractures Recommended - in select patients. Indications : Open fractures, initial shortening >15mm, angular deformity after initial manipulation >5 in any plane. C.17.c.iii.g Cast Immobilization for Distal Tibial Extra -Articular Fractures Recommended - in select circumstances for distal extra - articular tibial fractures. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 101 Indications : Closed simple fractures with initial shortening <15mm, angular deformity after initial manipulatio n <5 in any plane. Evidence for the Management of Tibial Extra -articular Fractures and Pilon Fractures Recommended - in select patients. Indications : Non-displaced, non -comminuted, stable fracture; ability to obtain acceptable fracture alignment with closed reduction. C.17.c.iii.i Operative Management of Tibial Plafond and Pilon Fractures Recommended - for tibial plafond fractures in select patients. Indications : Displaced, comminuted, or inability to obtain acceptable fracture alignment with closed reduction. Rationale for Recommendations : Distal lower leg fractures that impinge on the articular surface with the talus are known as plafond fractures. These fractures are noted to have high complication rates from surgical reduction and fixation. Evidence for the Management of Tibial Plafond and Pilon Fractures Syndesmotic Ruptures Operative treatment of injury to restore the tibiofibular re lationship . C.17.c.iii.j Operative Fixation for Syndesmotic Ruptures Recommended - for unstable syndesmotic rupture. Indications - Closed ankle fractures with unstable syndesmosis, AO fracture type C and/or pathologic widening of more than 2mm of the syndesmosis at intra -operative testing. C.17. c.iii.k Non-operative Management of Syndesmotic Injuries Recommended - for stable syndesmotic injury. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 102 Indications: Absence of other destabilizing injury including ankle fracture or deltoid ligament injury. Rationale for Recommendations : There is opinion that not all ankle syndesmotic injuries lead to ankle instability, and may not need repair in the absence of other destabilizing injury. Fixation is required in the presence of fracture. Thus, non-operative management is recommended for select patients. Operative repair is recommended for non -stable injuries, which include most syndesmotic rupture with concurrent fractures or deltoid ligament injury. Evidence for the Treatment of Syndesmotic Injury Fibular Fracture C.17.c.iii.l Operative Fixation for Displaced Distal Fibula Fractures Recommended - for displaced distal fibula fracture. Indication s: Distal fibula shaft fracture, unsatisfactory closed reduction. Rationale for Recommendation : Operative fixation is recommended for displaced, unstable distal fibular fractures. Evidence for the Operative Management of Fibular Shaft Fractures Arthroscopy with ORIF of Distal Assisted Fibular Fractures Not Recommended - for distal fibular fractures. Evidence for the Use of Arthroscopy Evaluation During Distal Tibia Fracture Fixation ORIF Deltoid Ligament Repair with ORIF of Lateral Ankle Fracture C.17.c.iii.n Deltoid Ligament Repair Concurrent with ORIF for Unstable Ankle Fractures Recommended - for patients with deltoid ligament disruption and high fibular fractures or in patients with concomitant syndesmotic fixation . Evidence for the Repair of Deltoid Ligament with Lateral Ankle Fracture Fixation C.17. c.iv Other NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 103 C.17. c.iv.a Pneumatic Compression for Treatment of Ankle and Foot Edema Recommended - for patients with significant postoperative edema. Indications: Excessive swelling after ankle fracture surgery. Evidence for the Use of Pneumatic Compression for Edema Management C.17. c.iv.b Interferential Therapy for Treatment of Ankle Edema Not Recommended - for the treatment of postoperative swelling following ORIF for displaced malleolar fracture. Evidence for the Use of Interferential Current Therapy Postoperative C.18.a.i X-ray Recommended - as a first -line study for suspected acute hindfoot fractures. Indications : Suspicion of fracture. Views : Calcaneus: AP, lateral, and calcaneal view ; Talus: AP, lateral, mortise, Broden views internal oblique) and Canale views (talar neck) . Evidence for the Use of X -ray for Hindfoot Fractures C.18.a.ii MRI Recommended - for suspected acute occult fracture of the talus and calcaneus. Indications - Generally reserved for suspicion of occult fracture of the talus neck or lateral process. Patients whose plain images indicate osteochondral lesion and those who remain symptomatic after six weeks should undergo evaluation with MRI. C.18.a.i ii MRI for Follow -up Evaluation of Non -acute Calcaneus Fracture NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 104 Recommended - for calcaneus fractures for identification of complications in the non -acute fracture patient. Indications: Non-acute fracture patient with persistent pain more than four months after injury. Rationale for Recommendations : MRI is used for suspected occult fracture, as some talus fractures are not apparent on radiographs. MRI is also indicated for evaluation of avascular necrosis . In general, MRI is suboptimal compared with CT scan for calcaneus injury. Evidence for the Use of MRI for Hindfoot Fractu res C.18.a.iv Bone Scanning for Calcaneus Fracture Recommended - for diagnosis of occult and stress fractures in select patients. Rationale for Recommendation : A bone scan may be reasonable for those with high clinical suspicion but with negative x -ray and CT scan. Bone scans are utilized to diagnose occult calcaneus fractures and stress fractures of the calcaneus. Evidence for the Use of Bone Scanning for Hindfoot Fractures C.18.a.v CT for Diagnosis and Classification of Hindfoot Fractures Recommended - for investig ation of hindfoot fractures. CT is recommended for occult and complex distal extremity, ankle, and foot fractures to gain greater clarity of fracture displacement, articular involvement, and subluxation of affected joints. If intraarticular displacement is considered, then axial views are recommended in addition to any coronal views. CT is indicated for evaluation of suspected subtalar joint fractures. Views : Coronal and axial. Rationale for Recommendation : CT scans are con sidered the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing calcaneus fractures. For other hindfoot fractures, CT should be considered when x -ray images are negative, but on the basis of physical findings an occult fracture is strongly suspected. CT may al so be useful for evaluation of complex comminuted fractures, providing superior depiction of distal tibial articular surface involvement, fragment positioning, and diagnosis of subluxations. The value of CT has been demonstrated - its use for evaluation of articular step off and gaping, comminution, and treatment has influenced observers to change treatment plans developed from radiographs . Evidence for the Use of CT for Hindfoot Fractures NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 105 C.18. a.vi Follow -up Visits - Imaging For talus fracture, if clinically suspected in the setting of negative radiographs, follow -up radiographs may be helpful; after approximately seven days there will be resorption at the fracture line, which will then be visible more easily. Follow -up radiog raphy at six to eight weeks for confirmed talus fracture, looking for the Hawkins sign, a radiographic subchondral radiolucent band in the talar dome. This sign, visible in the anterior -posterior view, is indicative of viability at six to eight weeks post - fracture indicating that avascular necrosis is unlikely to develop. C.18. b Medications Non-Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Acetaminophen For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and - for fracture analgesia. Indications : For hindfoot fracture analgesia, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of foot/ankle pain, lack of efficacy, or development of advers e effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.18. b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding. Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s - For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers . NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 106 Frequency/Dose/Duration - Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleedi ng. Indications for Discontinuation - Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.18. b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the ben eficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.18. b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Hindfoot Fracture Pain Recommended - for treatment of hindfoot frracture pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with foot/ankle pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative . Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs and Acetaminophen for Foot and Ankle Fractures C.18.b.v Limited Use of Opioids for Acute and Postoperative Pain Management Recommended - for limited use (less than seven days) in select patients for acute and postoperative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indicati ons: For acute injury and postoperative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatments (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen, elevation, splinting) is often required, especially nocturnally. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 107 Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for Recommendation : Select patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for br ief, select use in postoperative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep postoperative ly. Evidence for the Use of Opioids for Foot and Ankle Fractures C.18. b.vi Tetanus Immunization Status for Open Fractures Recommended - updating of tetanus immunization status as necessary. Indications: Wounds that are not clean if more than five years have elapsed since last tetanus immunization. Rationale for Recommendation: As the adverse effects of not immunizing may be fatal, te tanus immunization updating for open wounds is recommended. Wounds that are not clean or burns should require immunization if more than five years since last immunization, rather than ten years. Patients without a completed immunization series of three injections should receive tetanus immune globulin along with immunization. Evidence for the Use of Tetanus Immunization for Open Foot and Ankle Fractures C.18.b .vii Pre-Operative Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Ankle Fractures Recommended - for closed or open ankle fracture surgery. Evidence for the Use of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Ankle Fractures C.18.b. viii Use of Nasal Spray Calcitonin for Post -fracture Not Recommended osteopenia. Rationale for Recommendation: Nasal calcitonin obtained from salmon compared with placebo did not result in significant differences in bone mineralization 3 months after surgery. Evidence for the Use of Calcitonin Prophylaxis for Post -fracture of the Achilles tendon rupture section. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 108 C.18.c T reatments C.18.c.i Rehabilitation Therapy Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work - related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Activ e interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices m ay be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.18. c.i.a Diathermy for Management of Edema Associated with Calcaneus Fracture Not Recommended - for management of edema associated with calcaneus fractures. Evidence for the Use of Diathermy for Edema Control C.18.c.i.b Therapeutic Exercise - Physical / Occupational Therapy Recommended - to improve function, including range of motion and strength. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 109 C.18.c. ii Fracture Care Talus Fractures Because of its key position, diagnosis and treatment of talus fractures is critical for foot and ankle function. C.18. c.ii.a Non-operative Management of Non -displaced Talar Fractures Not Recommended - for non -displaced talar fractures (head, neck, body). C.18. c.ii.b Operative Management of Displaced Talar Fractures Recommended - for all displaced talar fractures (head, neck, body, lateral process). Indications: All non -displaced, non -reducible fractures. Referral to specialist is indicated for all injuries due to the high potential for poor outcomes of these injuries. Emergent referral for talar neck fractures . Rationale for Recommendations : Because of the key role the talus plays in locomotion, and the risk for significant disability and complication with these fractures referral to specialists for most, if not all, talus fractures is recommended. Evidence for the Management of Talar Fractures Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus C.18. c.ii.c Non-Operative Management of Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus Recommended - for select patients. Indications: A non -operative approach is indicated for initial management of lateral lesions that radiographically appear to be a compression lesion with no visible fragment or there is a fragment but it is still attached. Management: C ast or brace immobilization a nd protected weight -bearing for six to 12 weeks, followed by increasing pain-free range -of-motion exercises and strengthening. C.18.c.ii.d Operative Intervention for Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 110 Recommended - after an initial course of conservative management. Microfracture and osteochondral autograft are recommended. Rationale for Recommendations : A trial of conservative management is recommended initially. A trial of protected weight bearing for six to 12 weeks is reasonable. Evidence for the Use of Operative Management for Osteochondral Lesions Calcaneus Fractures C.18.c.ii.e Cast Immobilization for Select Calcaneus Fractures Recommended - for select calcaneus fractures. Indications: Non-displaced fracture, displaced extra - articular, displaced intra -articular. C.18.c.ii.f Operative Management for Select Calcaneus Fractures Recommended - for select calcaneus fractures. Indications: Displaced, non -reducible extra -articular fractures, displaced intra -articular fractures. Rationale for Recommendations : Both operative and non - operative management have considerable potential for adverse effects, including secondary late fusion, compartment syndrome and fasciotomy, DVT and pulmonary embol ism, and late -term arthrodesis. Evidence for the Management of Calcaneal Fractures C.18. c.iii Other C.18. c.iii.a Use of Pneumatic Compression Device for Treatment of Calcaneus Fractures Recommended - for patients with significant edema after closed calcaneus fractures. Indications: Patients with excessive swelling after closed displaced calcaneus fractures who are surgical candidates. Use in non -operative patients to reduce risk of other complications. Frequency/Duration: Pedal compression device used continuously until swelling subsides sufficiently to allow for surgery or to manage non -operatively. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 111 Rationale fo r Recommendation : Pneumatic compression for edema management is recommended for management of acute calcaneus fracture management in select patients with significant edema . Evidence for the Management of Edema Associated for Suspected Acute Forefoot or Midfoot Fractures Recommended - as a first -line study for suspected forefoot or midfoot fractures. Indications : Suspicion of all forefoot and midfoot fractures. Views : AP, lateral , and oblique. Rationale for Recommendation : X-ray assists in identifying fractures, orientation of fracture plane(s), magnitude of the involvement of the interphalangeal and metatarsal phalangeal joints, which if large enough may alter man agement in favor of surgery (see below). If fracture is clinically suspected in the setting of negative radiographs, follow -up radiographs may be helpful; after approximately seven days there will be resorption at the fracture line, which will then be visi ble. Evidence for the Use of X -ray for Suspected Tarsal, Metatarsal, or Phalangeal Fractures C.19.a.ii MRI for Suspected Acute Forefo ot and Midfoot Fractures Recommended - for suspected occult and stress fracture in select patients. Indications : Generally reserved for suspicion of occult or stress fracture of the fore or midfoot, however, CT is viewed as superior by some. Rationale for Recommendation : MRI should not be used as a first -line test. MRI may be an important diagnostic technique for the evaluation of suspected injuries of the navicular, tarsometatarsal joint (Lisfranc injury) and for early diagnosis of suspected stress fracture. MRI is also used for suspected occult fracture and for evaluation of avascular necrosis. Evidence for the Use of MRI for Suspected Tarsal Metatarsal and Phalangeal Fractures C.19.a.iii Bone Scanning for Forefoot and Midfoot Fractur es Recommended - for diagnosis of occult and stress fractures in select patients. NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 112 Indications : Generally reserved for suspicion of occult fracture of th e tarsal and metatarsal bones. Rationale for Recommendation : Bone scans are not required for evaluation of the majority of patients with forefoot and midfoot fractures. A bone scan may be reasonable for patients with high clinical suspicion but negative x -ray or CT scan. Evidence for the Use of Bone Scan for Suspected Tarsal, Metatarsal, or Phalangeal Fractures CT and Classification of Forefoot and Midfoot Fractures Recommended - in select patients for investigation of forefoot and midfoot fractures. Indications: Evaluation of displaced or comminuted fracture of the tarsal and metatarsal bones to gain greater clarity of fracture displacement, articular involvement, and subluxation of affected joints. Generally, this is a second -line diagnostic tool after x -rays. Rationale for Recommendation : CT should not be used as a first -line test. CT may be an important diagnostic technique to gain greater clarity of fracture displacement, articular involvement, and subluxation of affected joints, and is recommended for select patients. Evidence for the Use of CT for Suspected Tarsal Metatarsal and Phalangeal and Acetaminophen For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paraceta mol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. Acetaminophen for or Metatarsal Fracture Pain Control Recommended - for phalangeal or metatarsal fracture pain control . Indications : For acute, subacute, chronic, or postoperative phalangeal or metatarsal fracture NSAIDs are recommended for NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 113 treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of foot/ankle pain, lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.19.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High -Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding. Recommended - concomminent use of cytoprotective classes of misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at High-Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who als o have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smoke rs. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal blee ding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.19.b.i ii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse.

NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 115 Indications: Multiple metatarsals fractured if displaced; shaft fracture near metatarsal head. Management: Percutaneous pinning or internal fixation with screws, plates; non -weight bearing four to six weeks. Progressive weight -bearing over next four to six weeks in fracture shoe/boot or walking cast. Full weight -bearing in shoes/stiff soled shoe after radiograp hic evidence of union. Rationale for Recommendations : Immobilization or fixation technique is dictated by the physical and radiographic findings. Evidence for the Management of Metatarsal Fractures C.19. c.i.e Non-operative Management for Proximal Fifth Metatarsal Fractures (Including Joints and Avulsion) . Recommended for patients. <1 to 30% articular surface with cuboid; Jones Fracture: patient/provider preference. Management: Repeat films at one and six Jones Fracture: non-weight -bearing short -leg cast immobil ization for one and six weeks, followed by hard -sole shoe or walking cast until union. C.19. c.i.f Operative Management for Fifth Displaced Metatarsal Shaft Fractures (Jones, Avulsion) Recommended - for select patients. Indications: Avulsion of tuberosity: displaced >1 to 2mm step-off articular surface or more 30% of articular surface with Jones Fracture: patient/ Management: Avulsion of tuberosity: similar to metatarsal shaft fractures treated ope ratively. Jones Fracture: non-weight bearing Jones splint for 2 weeks, followed by weight bearing in hard -sole shoe as tolerated. Rationale for Recommendations : Immobilization or fixation technique is dictated by the physical and radiographic findings. Evidence for the Management of Proximal Fifth Metatarsal Injuries NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 116 C.19. c.i.g Immobilization for Distal, Middle, or P roximal Phalanx Recommended - for treatment of select patients . Indications: Closed, non -displaced or stable after reduction, involves less than 25% of articular surface . Management : Closed reduction after digital or hematoma block; obtain post -reduction film, repeat at one and six weeks; splint toe with buddy taping to adjacent toe until non - tender ( three to four weeks) excluding hallux . Additional immobilization with a postoperative shoe or cast -boot should be considered. C.19. c.i.h Operative Management for Distal, Middle, or Proximal Phalanx Fractures Recommended - for treatment of select patients . Indications: Displaced fractures of great toe with poor reduction, unable to hold reduction with tape splinting. Rationale for Recommendations : Immobilization or fixation technique is therefore dictated by the physical and radiographic findings. It is generally limited to displaced fractures of the great toe or multiple toe fract ures. Evidence for the Management of Phalangeal Fractures C.19 .c.i.i Non-operative Management for Lower Extremity Stress Fractures Recommended - for low risk lower extremity stress fractures. Indicat ions: Non-displaced stress fractures. Management : All non -displaced stress fractures can be treated conservatively initially. C.19. c.i.j Operative Management for Lower Extremity Stress Fractures Recommended -for lower extremity stress fractures (including navicular stress fractures) that do not respond to non-operative management or that are displaced . Rationale for Recommendations : Stress fractures respond well to activity restriction in most i nstances. Activity restriction is therefore recommended. Stress fractures that do not respond or that are displaced are treated operatively . NYS WCB MTG - Ankle and Foot Disorders 117 Specialists may sometimes elect to initially treat select, minimally displaced fractures non -operatively.
