Member of the Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association (AACMA) and Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Authority (AHPRA). I believe in dealing with the root cause of any discomfort you are having rather than just symptoms alone. At Rebalance TCM we use an integrated approach which incorporates your mind, body and spirit to ensure a complete treatment to help you improve your health and feel rebalanced, revitalised and rejuvenated. I am also passionate about early prevention and timely management of DIS-EASE as opposed to waiting until you are in severe pain or worse before receiving treatment "}
