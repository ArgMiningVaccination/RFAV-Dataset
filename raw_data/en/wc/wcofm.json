Alzheimer 's disease (AD), the most common cause of mid-to- late life cognitive impairment and dementia, is pathologi- cally de ned by deposits of amyloid- (A42)-plaques and (p-tau) tangles. Complex, inter- acting, and incompletely understood biopsychosocial and pathological processes lead to heterogeneous AD clinicalphenotypes (i.e., cognitive-behavioral syndromes related to AD). AD biopathological processes develop over one to two \"preclinical \"decades before symptoms manifest insidiously; this preclinical period is increasingly targeted in research and may represent the best opportunities to potentially delay or prevent onset of dementia stages of AD. 1,2The current treatment paradigm in Alzheimer 's disease (AD) involves a multipronged approach of combining pharma- cological and nonpharmacological approaches to mitigateprogressive loss of cognitive and functional abilities. No new AD medications have been approved by Food and Drug Admin- istration (FDA) since 2002 (other than a capsule preparationthat combines two available medications). However, over the last decade multiple lines of evidence from randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials (RCT), and pro-spectivelong-term observational cohort studies have emerged to support the clinical effectiveness of AD medications, in mono-, or add-on-dual combination therapy to at leastKeywords cognitive impairment dementia cholinesterase- inhibitorAbstract The foundation of current Alzheimer 's disease (AD) treatment involves pharmacolo- gical and nonpharmacological management and care planning predicated on patient-centered psychoeducation, shared goal-s etting, and decision-making forged by a strong triadic relationship between clinic ian and the patient-caregiver dyad. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AD medications, cholinesterase-inhibitors (ChEIs), and the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NM DA) antagonist memantine, when utilized as part of a comprehensive care plan, while generally considered symptomatic medica-tions, can provide modest \"disease course-modifying \"effects by enhancing cognition, and reducing loss of independence. When co mbined, pharmacologic and nonpharma- cologic treatments can meaningfully mitigate symptoms and reduce clinical progres-sion and care burden. AD pharmacotherapy rst involves identi cation and elimination of potentially harmful medications and supplements. First line treatment for neurop-sychiatric symptoms and problem behaviors is nonpharmacological and involvespsychoeducation, trigger identi cation, and implementatio n, iterative evaluation, and adjustment of behavioral and environmental interventions. Intensive researchefforts are underway to develop more accurate and practical AD diagnostic biomarkers and clinical tools and better therapeutics. Ongoing research studies for primary and secondary prevention of AD and clinical trials evaluating symptomatic anddisease-modifying treatments in symptomatic AD are directed at diverse therapeutictargets including neurochemicals, amyloid and tau pathological processes, mitochon-dria, in pathways, neuroglia, and Arash Salardini, MDCopyright \u00a9 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, USA.

In vivo AD biomarkers of the pathological process are now available in the clinic. Measurements of amyloid-Beta 42(A42), tau ( ), and phospho-tau (p-tau) proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as A 42-plaque burden on amyloid-PET (positron emission tomography), can now aid clinical, as well are research, diagnosis of AD with a high level of certainty. Though breakthroughs to affect newer AD therapeutics have yet to materialize, learning fromdozens of large and varied clinical trial programs have provided cornerstones of ongoing intensive research efforts that aim at primary and secondary prevention, as well assymptomatic and disease-modifying treatments for AD. This paper will (1) review current multifactorial manage- ment of AD, with a focus on practical aspects of psychoedu-cation and behavioral approaches, clinical evidence, and considerations for treatment with FDA-approved AD medi- cations; and (2) brie fly summarize experimental pharmaco- logical approaches under research investigation that are likely to form the bases of future combination therapies in the AD clinical spectrum. Current Treatments in AD There is no cure for AD dementia. It is increasingly recognized that the complex and incompletely understood pathological processes culminating in AD dementia can begin decades priorto the manifestation of clinical symptoms, by which time extensive and likely irreversible processes have wrought wide- spread destruction on multiple levels: molecular, intracellular,cellular, network, and systems. The current AD treatment paradigm is one of multifaceted management of symptomsaimed at retaining quality of life, mitigating the burden of illness and reducing long-term clinical decline. Successful long-term pharmacotherapy with FDA-approved AD medica-tions, initially involving monotherapy inhibitor (ChEI) and ultimately involving add-on nation treatment with a ChEI and memantine, requires devel-oping, implementing and sustaining a solid foundation of psychoeducation, nonpharmacological and behavioral care strategies, and clarity in care goals and expectations; this is predicated on a strong therapeutic alliance between the clinician and the patient -caregiver dyad. Management of AD Table 2 broadly outlines the multifactorial tailored man- agement of AD. Evaluation and management of AD requires a solid foundation of open, honest, and compassionate com- munication; shared goal setting; and a triadic partnershipbetween the clinician, patient and care-partner(s). tion and management should be a patient -caregiver dyad- centered and dynamic processes that involve multiprongedand, ideally, integrated interdisciplinary team approaches. Treatment of AD is not curative and successful management to mitigate the burden of illness relies on four basic pillars:(1) timely and accurate syndromic and etiological diagnoses combined with proactive educational and care planning that are customized to the patient -caregiver dyad (the dyad) - without accurate diagnosis and tailored psychoeducation, appropriate dyad-centered treatment, and care can 'tb e nonpharmacological interventions and beha-vioral approaches; (3) pharmacological interventions; and (4) holistic care planning that is proactive, pragmatic and dynamic, and includes monitoring and adjustment of theTable 1 Risk factors for AD dementia Modifiable (in early life, midlife ages 45 -65 y, or later life ages >65 y)Nonmodifiable Vascular risks: Diabetes (later life)Hypertension (midlife) Dyslipidemia (midlife) Metabolic Syndrome and obesity (midlife) Smoking tobacco (later life) Low physical activity (later life)Cerebral hypoperfusion Cerebrovascular injury or stroke Depression (later life) Severe head trauma or traumatic brain injury Hearing loss (midlife)Low cognitive reserve: low education, intelligence, professional or social attainment/occupation (early life and potentially midlife) Low social contact (later life)Age Gender (female >male) Family history ( rst- or second-degree relative or multiple generations) Race Down 'sS y n d r o m e ApoE- 4 allele Cerebral amyloidosis -ab i o m a r k e ro ft h eA Dp a t h o l o g i c a lp r o c e s s a Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer 's disease; ApoE, Apolipoprotein E. aIt is currently a nonmodi able risk factor but primary and secondary prevention trials utilizing amyloid-modifying drugs are in progress and early results support that cerebral amyloid plaque burden can be lowered; whether this translates to clinical bene t or of lowering risk of progression to MCI or dementia, potentially making this be a modi able risk factor, is to be determined.

Psychoeducation Management of AD should foremost involve dyad-tailoredpsychoeducation based on the dyad 's priorities, strengths and limitations, environment, and resources. These factors are also salient during the evaluation process and in recom-mending, implementing, monitoring, and adjusting non- pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, and in the execution of a successful care plan. Psychoeducationshould also iteratively, throughout the evaluation and man- agement processes, assess the understanding (knowledge of facts) and appreciation (recognition that facts apply to theperson) regarding the presence, severity, and functional effects of the symptoms, the clinical syndrome, and the underlying condition/disease (e.g., AD), and regarding careplans. These factors guide education and communication that should be part of a structured process and dialogue to inform the dyad regarding the patient 's clinical status (e.g.,mild cognitive impairment vs. dementia); syndromic diagnosis (i.e., under- lying cause(s), such as AD or multiple etiology (mixed) dementia due to AD, and vascular cognitive impairment);expected course; life, safety-related and care planning needs; treatment, support, and care options; and health system, public, and psychosocial resources. Once this foundation isformed, a stage-appropriate pharmacological treatment plan can be instituted. Long-term dyad-centered management of AD requires proactive planning and flexibility to monitor and modify care plans according conditions, resources, and goals. NonPharmacological Management Behavioral problems, strategies, and interventions: during the course of illness, 85 to 90% of patients with AD will experience signicant neuropsychiatric symptoms and problem beha- viors (namely, noncognitive behavioral symptoms [NCBS]; or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [BPSD]), and BPSD are associated with more rapid decline, earlierTable 2 Key Elements of effective multifactorial management of AD Patient-caregiver dyad-centered evaluation, diagnosis and disclosure, and care planning processes \u0081Timely detection of symptoms, accurate assessment and diagno sis, iterative psychoeductio n, and appropriate disclosure. \u0081Shared goal setting for diagnostic, disclosure and manageme nt processes; sustained psych oeducation and tailoring of a proactive care plan to patient-caregiver dyad.

Precipitating factors for speci c behavior(e.g., triggersforaspeci c BPSDs) should be identi ed, modi ed, and continually assessed. Nonpharmacologic inter- ventions and behavioral strategies against BPSD include bothgeneral and tailored approaches to caregiver psychoeducation and training in dementia-speci c strategies for trigger avoid- ance, problem solving, communication, environment modi - cation, task and \"just right \"patient engagement and activities. BPSD psychoeduction for caregivers should include some explanation of general models of the biopsychosocial sub- strates of BPSD in AD, such as loss of behavioral and coping reserve, compromise of \"top-down \"control in frontostriatal networks, progression -regression models of aging and dementia with stripping of control systems and degenerative regression to early developmental stages in which limited capacities drive perceptions and problem behaviors. It is important to explain to caregivers that poor or problembehaviors by the individual with AD dementia are not inten- tional (e.g., to be mean, ornery, or vindictive) but are due to disease, brain injury/damage, and diminished capacities. Pharmacological Management The current AD medication treatment paradigm is to reduceprogression of symptoms and disability; expectations are for pharmacological treatments to modestly retard expected clin- ical decline in ways that are nonetheless meaningful. Despiteongoing efforts, a magic bullet or \"cure \"for AD in the dementia stages is unrealistic in the near future; by the time AD is in the dementia stages, degeneration has wrought multilevel braindestruction for one or more decades. Combined together, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management in AD seek to minimize the disabling effects of cognitive and func -tional decline and emergence and severity of BPSD. The FDA- approved AD medications, the ChEI and rivastigmine, and the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)antagonist memantine, can reduce progression of clinical symptoms and disability. From a public health and economics perspective, therapies that minimize caregiver burden anddelay nursing home entry translate into signi cant bene ts related to worker productivity and health care savings. 9-12 Review and elimination of potentially deleterious medica- tions: the initial step in the pharmacologic management of AD consists of reviewing and eliminating redundant and poten-tially deleterious medications. For example, diphenhydra- mine, often taken as an over-the-counter drug combination with acetaminophen for sleep and pain relief, and medicationsfor anxiety (e.g., benzodiazepines), urinary incontinence (e.g., those with high anticholinergic activity), and sedative/hypno- tics are relatively contraindicated in the elderly, require closescrutiny, and can be particularly deleterious in cognitively vulnerable older persons (see Beers 's criteria) 13,14 Treatment of co-morbid conditions that may contribute to or decompensate dementia symptoms: identifying and treating conditions that can negatively impact cognition, function, and behavior in patients with AD can substantiallyaffect clinical outcomes. In many individuals, the symptoms and signs of decompensation can be subtle, chronic, and may not manifest as acute delirium/encephalopathy (see 15,16for a review of delirium-dementia link). A cognitive laboratory panel (e.g., complete blood count [CBC], complete metabolic panel with liver panel, thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH],vitamin B 12, homocysteine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]) can help to identify common conditions that may exacerbate cognitive or behavioraldecline, including dehydration, electrolyte and metabolic derangements, anemia, cardiac or cerebral ischemia, hypoxia, thyroid and vitamin de ciencies (e.g., vitamin B 12 deciency), and infections (e.g., urinary tract infections, pneumonia). Other conditions, such as pain, for example, from arthritis, constipation, hunger, thirst, and fatigue arealso common in AD, particularly in later stages when patients cannot appropriately recognize or communicate their symp- toms; these can lead to BPSD, particularly anxiety, irritabil- ity, agitation, aggression, and sleep-wake disturbances. Use of antipsychotics in ad is off-label and carries substan- tial risk. Antipsychotics must be used with extreme caution, with ongoing monitoring and only when strict conditions have been met. 8,17In the U.S., though commonly used as off-label, antipsychotics carry an FDA black-box warning in dementia. Short- and long-term antipsychotic use in patients with dementia is associated with substantial risk of cognitivedecline, morbidity (e.g., parkinsonism, falls, pneumonia, car- diovascular, and cerebrovascular events), and mortality. Anti- psychotics should only be used as a last resort for severerefractory behavioral disturbances without an identi able and treatable cause (e.g., severe aggression, agitation, or psychosis not due to delirium, pain, or infection) or when a serious risk ofimmediate harm or safety exists that cannot be otherwise ameliorated. 8,17Risperidone is approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA) for short-term, 12-week, use in demen-tia when there is refractory severe agitation or psychosis; it is not approved for this indication in the U.S. After a careful evaluation, ideally by a dementia subspecialist, cautious use ofantipsychotics should be limited to the lowest effective dosages for short durations; continued use requires ongoing monitoring, assessment of risk-bene t, and understanding, Seminars in Neurology Vol. 39 No. 2/2019Current and Future Treatments in Alzheimer 'sD i s e a s e Atri 230 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Aggregate data supports that during the initial 6 to 12 months of treatment, performance on measures of cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), behavioral symp-toms, or global clinical impression of change may signi cantly improve in a minority (10 -20%), plateau in nearly half (30 - 50%), or continue to deteriorate in about a third (20 -40%) of treated patients. In dementia stages of AD, the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve stabilization or improvement in one or more clinical domains (e.g., cognition, function, behavior, global severity) ranges from 5 to 9:1 for monotherapy (with ChEI or memantine), as well as for dual ChEI-memantine add-on combination therapy. 22-24The NNT to achieve signi cant improvement on multiple domains simultaneously is approxi- mately 8:1 for ChEI-memantine dual combination therapy inmoderate to severe AD; in contrast, marked clinical worsening, dened by simultaneous signi cant worsening on multipledomains, is also reduced by 48 to 68% with ChEI-memantine combination therapy compared with ChEI alone. 20At the group level in clinical studies, discontinuation of ChEI treat- ment has been demonstrated to be harmful -the group of patients taken off and the group of patients that are noncom-pliant with medication adherence appear to progress more rapidly than groups of patients who continue treatment. Unless otherwise indicated, clinicians should avoid disconti-nuation trials of ChEIs to \"see if there is worsening \"-even temporary discontinuation is associated with irreversible declines and greater risk of nursing home placement. 25-30 The question of when, in whom, and how to discontinue AD medications (e.g., deprescription), particularly in late-stage dementia, requires further research. Sustained AD medication treatment provides greater like- lihood of overall stabilization in the short-term and an expected modest reduction in the trajectory of clinical declinein the long-term. As the AD progresses, over several months to years, patients who may initially show improvement or stabi- lity, will eventually decline, even when pharmacological treat-ments are sustained. The care plan for any individual patient should be holistic, evidence-based, and customized to dyad goals, preferences, and circumstances. It is important forclinicians to communicate practical issues and expectations associated with AD pharmacologic treatment; these include treatment rationale and expected outcomes. In the long run,current pharmacological management of AD can mitigate but not prevent decline. Cholinesterase-inhibitors : ChEIs facilitate central choliner- gic activity by reducing the physiological breakdown of acetyl Ch (ACh) by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase thusenhances cholinergic neurotransmission. and characteristics : although there are mechanistic and pharmacokinetic differences among the available ChEI drugs (see Table 3 ), there is no compelling data to support signi cant group-level ef cacy differences between them. An oral formulation of all three ChEI 'si s generically available in the U.S. Donepezil and rivastigmine have approved FDA-label indications in mild, moderate, andsevere AD dementia; galantamine is FDA-approved for mild and moderate AD.

ChEIs safety and tolerability : with slow titration in appro- priate individuals, ChEIs are generally tolerated well and havean acceptable adverse effect pro le. 3The most common adverse effects which include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, flatulence, loose stools, diarrhea, salivation, and abdominal cramping are related to peripheral cholinomimetic effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. For oral preparations, adverse GI effects of ChEIs can be minimized by administering the drugafter a meal or in combination with memantine. Some indi- viduals can experience vivid dreams or mild insomnia, thus doses should ideally be given after a meal in the morning. Therivastigmine transdermal patch can also cause skin irritation, redness, or rash at the site of application. Overall, adverse effects may occur in 5 to 20% of patients starting on ChEI 's but are usually mild and transient, and can be mitigated by dose and rate of dose escalation. ChEIs may also decrease heart rate and increase the risk of syncope, particularly in susceptibleindividuals (e.g., those with sick sinus syndrome or atrioven- tricular [AV] block) and with overdose. Use of these agents is contraindicated in patients with unstable or severe cardiacdisease, uncontrolled epilepsy, unexplained syncope, and active peptic ulcer disease. Risk of adverse effects can also be mitigated by supervising administration of all medications,including ChEIs -too often patients with AD, particularly in milder stages, are left unsupervised to access or take medica- tions, resulting in inconsistency or duplication of doses; ef cacy and induce harm. ChEIs and In over 40 short-term trials (RCTs) over 24 and in meta-analyses of RCTs, all three ChEIs have demonstrated small to medium effect- size treatment bene ts at the patient-group level in terms of improving, stabilizing or delaying decline in cognition, activ- ities of dialing living, and global status, and in ameliorating BPSD and caregiver burden. 21,28,29,31 -43In the few studies that have directly compared ChEIs to each other, no signi - cant differences were found.44,45Longer term bene ts of 2 to 4 years or more are also supported by longer term open-label extension27,46 -48and long-term prospective observation clinical cohort studies.49-53Level II (and equivocal level I) evidence suggest donepezil may be bene cial in very mild stage AD or for subgroups with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (i.e., carriers of APOE-e4 (Apolipoprotein E) allele,54those with depression or depressive symptoms55). Such off-FDA label pharmacotherapy is not suf ciently supported by level I evidence to warrant an unequivocal recommendation for all patients. However, ef - cacy/effectiveness, risk (tolerability and safety), and cost data,individual clinical circumstances, and patient-caregiver dyad preferences may warrant a discussion between clinicians, patients, and caregivers about this possibility. 54 NMDA antagonists (memantine) : Memantine was the last FDA-approved treatment for AD dementia (2002) and remains the sole medication in its class. Memantine affectsglutamatergic transmission; it is a blocker. Memantine tine is available in immediate-release twice daily (available generically in the U.S.) and extended-release once daily pre- parations. A combination capsule that combines donepezil10 mg with various dosages of memantine extended-release (XR) is also available in the U.S. The pharmacokinetic pro les and characteristics of the memantine formulations arereviewed in Table 4 . Memantine is mostly renally cleared and does not affect the hepatic CYP450 enzyme system. Memantine safety and tolerability : titrated appropriately, memantine has a favorable safety and tolerability pro le. Mild and transient treatment-emergent side effects may include confusion, dizziness, constipation, headache, andsomnolence; these may be encountered during, or soon after, titration to the maximum total daily dose of 10 mg twice daily for immediate-release memantine, or 28 mg once dailyfor memantine XR. (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), a dose-adjust- ment to 5 mg twice daily for immediate-release memantine and 14 mg daily for memantine XR is ADdementia, as monotherapy or in combination with a ChEI (often added on to existing ChEI treatment).

Safety and tolerability of ChEI-memantine add-on combi- nation treatment : several studies have reported on safety and tolerability of combination therapy; overall, there is a goodprole for both. Addition of memantine to stable doses of ChEIs does not correspond to signi cant overall increases in adverse events (AEs). The rates of discontinuation due to AEsfor ChEIs and memantine combination treatment are low (see Table 5 ), between 5 to 10%, and not generally sig- nicantly different from placebo.58,72,84 -86 Vitamins, medical foods, and supplements : Other than for vitamin E, large RCTs have failed to provide support from level III/IV epidemiological association studies for potentialbenet of vitamins/supplements at the AD dementia stage.

For patients with moderate to severe AD, memantine can be initiated once patients have received stable ChEI therapy forseveral months without adverse effects ( Table 5 ). Meman- tine monotherapy can be initiated on-label if the patient has moderate or later stage AD; conversely a ChEI can be addedafter several months of stable memantine monotherapy. The latter may be a particularly useful strategy in patients whoare very sensitive to or experience GI side effects with ChEIs. A very low and slow titration (e.g., starting donepezil 2.5 mgdaily after breakfast, increasing it to 5 mg daily if no side effects emerge within 6 weeks) may be helpful in patients who are very sensitive to cholinomimentic effects. In highlyrefractory situations, switching to another ChEI at a low-dose can be tried. Persistence, higher dose (in later dementia stages) and duration of treatment are associated with betteroutcomes even in those with advanced dementia. 50,53,75,76,90 All patients should have diligent management of their vascular risk factors including lipids, blood pressure, andglucose. Anxiety and clinical depression should be monitored and treated (using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] with low geriatricprole, e.g., citalopram,escitalopram, sertraline). Thereshould be proactive monitoring and optimization of sleep, stress level, hydration, and nutrition status; any de ciencies (e.g., thyroid, vitamin B 12) and systemic conditions that can decompensate mental functionsshouldbetreated (e.g., urinary tract infection [UTI], dehydration, hyponatremia). Along with social andmental engagement, and stress management, daily exercise, and physical activity should be an integral part of the care plan. Potentially deleterious medications, including anticholi- nergic medications and benzodiazepines, should be weaned off and avoided. Off-label use of antipsychotics should be Table 6 Recommended notes Donepezil Starting dose: 5 mg/d; can be increased to 10 mg/d after 4 -6 wk.

When to start and stop AD medications : per FDA prescrib- ing information, clinicians may start a ChEI in mild, moder-ate, or severe AD, and memantine in moderate or severe AD. In moderate stages, a ChEI or memantine can be started, and ultimately, the complementary agent can be added toachieve dual/combination therapy. Based on the patient - caregiver dyad preferences and clinician comfort and exper- tise, an individualized discussion can be prompted regardingthe pros and cons, cost, and uncertainties of off-label pre- scription of AD medications, such as ChEIs in MCI due to AD 54 and high-dose vitamin E.87,88 AD medications can be maintained in late-stages to sup- port basic psychomotor processes, praxis, functional com- munication, behavioral responses required to assistcaregivers to deliver basic ADL care, and the elementary processes of movement and eating. The bene ts may also extend to reducing antipsychotic usage. In the terminalstages of AD when personhood has disintegrated, and when there is no meaningful communication or interaction, patients should only receive care (pharmacological or other-wise) that is directed to provide palliation and comfort. 91 Future Treatments in AD Despite no new treatments being approved for AD since2002, and the failure or abandonment of more than 200investigational programs in the interim, the AD drug pipeline remains moderately full of presumed disease-modifying and symptomatic agents with a variety of mechanisms of action (MOA). A search of clinicaltrials.gov (accessed November 19, 2018) for phase I -III interventional clinical trials that are \"recruiting \"or\"active but not recruiting \"for AD shows over 150 results. A recent annual review of the AD drug develop- ment pipeline found 112 agents: 26 agents in 35 trials inphase III, 63 agents in 75 trials in phase II, and 23 agents in 25 trials in phase I. 92The presumed MOA of agents in the pipeline were classi ed as disease-modifying therapies (DMT) in 63%, symptomatic cognitive enhancers in 22%, and symptomatic agents addressing BPSD in 12%.92 Agents classi ed as DMTs are posited to affect upstream underlying AD pathobiology related to A and tau, and are hypothesized, if ef cacious, to be able to slow disease progression that would manifest clinically with chronicbenets (over many months to years) of reducing the rate of decline. Agents classi ed as symptomatic therapies are posited to mainly affect downstream neurochemical, mole-cular, synaptic, resultant disruptive cas- cades, and are hypothesized to be able to show symptomaticeffects that would manifest clinically with relatively acute benets (over weeks to a few months) of improvement in cognitive functions or mitigation of symptoms.While DMTs are presumed to affect AD etiology, this area remains one of controversy and one that is not completelyunderstood. 93-95Over the past 25 years, variations of prevail- ing \"amyloid-related \"hypothesis models of AD have posited a causative or necessary role of accumulation of synapto- andneuro-toxic forms of A ,n a m e l yA 42oligomers, proto brils, andbrils, ultimately forming insoluble extracellular microglial and hyperphosphorylation of the tubule stabilizing protein tau, and formation of tangles.95-100 tau-Mediated processes are posited to cause further synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and destruction, suggested to have a prion-like seed and spread intersynaptically and interneuron-ally, thus leading to widespread cortical dysfunction. Other models have posited microvascular injury tipping the balance in favor of accumulation of toxic A 42species,94and two-stage models that posit an \"amyloid-dependent \"rst phase, led by soluble oligomeric and brillar A accumulation that over time becomes increasingly decoupled from amyloid in the\"amyloid-independent \"second stage to brillary neuronal and synaptic loss and further sequelae. 95 Support for an early and central role of A in AD patho- genesis comes from a rare familial autosomal dominant forms of AD (FADAD; accounts for <1% of all AD) that usually manifest in \"early-onset \"AD (EoAD; dementia onset prior to age 65; <4% of all AD), and are caused by mutations in presenilin-1 (PSEN-1), amyloid precursor protein (APP) orpresenilin-2 (PSEN-2). 101These gene products affect A metabolism; FADAD mutations result in increased, relative, or absolute production of the A 42. This strong link between all genetic determinants of AD and the overproduction of A42has provided support for amyloid-related hypotheses and a majority of drug candidates tested in the last 15 or so years have posited an amyloid-related MOA. Anti-amyloid DMTs Antiamyloid DMTs have focused MOAs: of A 42production (secretase inhibitors: gamma [ secretase inhibitors, reduction of A-plaque burden via aggregation inhibitors; and (3) pro- motion of A clearance via active or passive immunotherapy. Reduction of A 42Production by -secretase Inhibitors/ Modulators and -Secretase Inhibitors The A 42peptide is formed from the amyloid -protein precursor (APP) by the sequential cutting actions of -a n d -secretases. While reduction of A 42production by -a n d - secretase inhibitors appeared as promising therapeutic approaches, and drugs in these classes have shown to reliably decrease A 42production in patients, concerns regarding adverse effects have slowed development of these drugs. -Secretase inhibitors/modulators : the development of the -secretase inhibitor semagecestat was halted in phase III due to its association with worsening of daily function and increased rates of skin cancer and infections.102Development of avagecestat, another -secretase inhibitor, was halted in Seminars in Neurology Vol. 39 No. 2/2019Current and Future Treatments in Alzheimer 'sD i s e a s e Atri 235 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. phase II due to its association with higher progression rate fromprodromal/MCI AD dementia, as well as increased rates ofskin cancer. 103Safety concerns for -secretase inhibitors stem from toxicity risks due to blocking ofcritical cell differentiation events related to interference with the NOTCH protein, aprotein that plays an important role in control of normal cell differentiation and communication. Taren flurbil ( r-flurbipro- fen,flurizan) was the rst-secretase inhibitor to lack of ef cacy, and ef cacy in a phase III program. -Secretase inhibitors : the development of -secretase inhi- bitors (BACEi 's), while still ongoing for some agents (elenbece- stat, CNP520), has also recently encountered major dif culties that have resulted in discontinuation of several clinical trials, with agents in this class including verubecestat (MK-8931),atabecestat, lanabecestat, and LY3202606. A phase III verube- cestat clinical program was discontinue due to futility in mild and moderate AD dementia, and treatment was associatedwith rash, falls and neuropsychiatric symptoms. 104In a very recent late breaking news symposium at clinical trials AD (CTAD, Barcelona, October 24, 2018; available from: https://www.alzforum.org/print-series/1076786 for a report of the symposium) verubecstat, atabecestat, and LY3202626 were reported to be associated with detrimental effects on cogni-tion in prodromal AD; atabecestat was also associated with liver toxicity. All agents show signi cant effects on reduction of A 42in the CSF, and while the mechanism causing rela- tively acute detrimental effects (mild to moderate effect sizes) on cognition for some of these agents is unknown, some posited suggestions include too much suppression, tooquickly, of A 42production and levels, and off-target effects including BACE-2 inhibition. Reduction of A -plaque Burden via Aggregation Inhibitors Agents with this MOA include ELND005 (scyllo-inositol), an oral A 42anti-aggregation agent. In preclinical studies, ELND005 slowed progression of AD pathology by neutraliz-ing A 42oligomers, inhibiting toxic effects on synaptic transmission, preventing the formation and breaking down of A42brils. A phase II study in mild and moderate AD did not show ef cacy and suggested toxicity from higher doses tested (including death and infections).105Further develop- ment of the drug at the lowest dose (250 mg) has notprogressed in the last several years. Promotion of A Clearance via Active or Passive Immunotherapy Clinical trials in this MOA have dominated, and learnings from these negative trials have signi cantly impacted the AD drug development landscape in the past 15 years. Active immu- notherapy with AN-1792, in the rst humanvaccination trial in AD, was discontinued in 2002 due to T cell-activated menin-goencephalitis in 6% of vaccinated patients. 106Consequently, theeld turned to the development of passive immunotherapy approaches that would not risk T cell-mediated responses -therst agent of this class, bapineuzumab, did not show ef cacy in two phase III clinical trials in mild and moderate AD.107 However, valuable experience gained from several negative phase III bapineuzumab and solanezumab trials108paved the way for great insights regarding the need for requiring bio-marker evidence of AD pathology, speci cally \"amyloid posi- tivity, \"for subject inclusion in antiamyloid drug trials, the characteristics and association of amyloid related imagingabnormalities (ARIA) with antibody dose and Apolipoprotein -4 (Apo 4) genotype, necessity for higher dosing and evidence for target engagement (e.g., reduction of plaque burden onamyloid PET), low likelihood of treatment ef cacy in dementia stages of AD, and the subsequent development and testing of multiple anti-A \"mabs \"with different characteristics. Passive A immunotherapy : this amyloid-related MOA has been the most active and remains highly promising with several ongoing drug programs in phase III development,including aducanumab, gantenerumab, and BAN2401 in prodromal or very mild AD, and crenezumab, gantenerumab, and solanezumab in prevention trials for preclinical or at-genetic-risk populations. 92Safety considerations related to this MOA include risk of ARIA. Phase I-b results from aduca- numab suggested, for the rst time, a congruent signal for the association of treatment-related reduction in cerebral amy- loid burden and mitigation of clinical decline in patients with prodromal AD or very mild AD dementia.109 Active A immunotherapy. following AN-1792, second generation anti-A active immunotherapy agents were designed with higher speci city to A sites to avoid T-cell activation. Second generation vaccines remain under devel- opment and include ACC-001 (underwent phase II test- ing),110CAD106111(under testing in the Alzheimer 's prevention initiative, API), Generation 1 prevention trial in nonsymptomatic individuals who are homozygous for ApoE4), and Lu AF20513112(under Phase II testing in Stage two-third preclinical and prodromal AD). Anti-Tau DMTs Prevention of tau-Protein Phosphorylation or Fibrillarization, and Promotion of Clearance The other major potential DMT MOA, and one that has not yet had agents advance to phase III development, is via anti-phospho-tau approaches. Potential approaches to prevent tau-phosphorylation and synthetase kinase-3 meet II endpoints), assembly inhibitors and inhibitors (e.g., not meet week 12 phase II endpoint), while those promoting clearance include anti-tau passive immunother- apy (ABBV -8E12, AADVac-1; BIIB092 in phase testing). Other MOAs and Symptomatic Agents Cummings et al92provides a list of 40 putatively symptomatic agents in clinical trials for AD. The list includes agents with diverse MOAs, including sigma receptor agonists (AVP-786; AXS-05), SSRI 's (escitalopram for agitation in AD); Seminars in Neurology Vol. 39 No. 2/2019Current and Future Treatments in Alzheimer 'sD i s e a s e Atri 236 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. cannabinoid receptor agent (nabilone), 5HT-6 antagonists (SUVN-502 in phase II testing as triple add-on to backgroundChEI and memantine combination therapy in mild and mod- erate AD; this MOA was not observed to be ef cacious in phase III testing as add-on to background antagonists (riluzole), anti-epileptics (levetiracetam), and many others. Insights from dozens of large and varied clinical trial pro- grams in the last decade have provided cornerstones ofongoing intensive research efforts that aim to develop more accurate diagnostic tools (e.g., utilizing neuroimaging, blood, CSF, pro-teomic,andgenomicbiomarkers ofAD) and better therapeutics via symptomatic and disease-modifying treatments for AD. Primary and secondary AD prevention trials are also underway.Multifactorial lifestyle intervention clinical trials (e.g., FINGER study [Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cogni- tive Impairment and Disability] 115) and risk reduction of modi able risk factors (see Table 1 ) also presents great opportunities to reduce the risk of AD and dementia.1 Summary The current AD treatment paradigm is to mitigate symptoms and reduce clinical progression. Nonpharmacologic manage- ment and pharmacologic therapies, including FDA-approved AD medications (ChEIs and memantine), are aimed to mini-mize the disabling effects from cognitive and functional decline, and BPSD. Clinicians should establish a proactive and flexible patient/dyad-centered approach to compassionately care for individuals with AD and their caregivers. Establishing and maintaining a strong therapeutic alliance that is holistic,pragmatic, and involves psychoeducation, behavioral and environmental strategies, appropriate pharmacotherapy, planning for current and future care needs, and promotion of brain health, and patient -caregiver dyad psychosocial well-being is central to competent and ethical care in AD. Intensive research efforts remain underway to develop more accurate diagnostic tools and better AD therapeutics. A myriad of ongoing phase I -III human clinical trials for primary and secondary prevention, as well as symptomatic and disease-modifying treatment, are directed at diverse therapeutic targets in AD including neurochemicals, amy-loid, and tau-pathological processes, mitochondria, neuroglia.
