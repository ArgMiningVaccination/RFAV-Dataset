The SP Detox Balance powder is full of whole food-based nutritional ingredients and is packed with 17 grams of protein. How It Works The SP Detox Balance Program provides the body with additional nutritional support it may need to metabolize and expel toxins safely during each of the three phases of metabolic detoxification.* Phase I: Unlock The body transforms fat-soluble toxins to an \"unlocked\" state that is more water-soluble, and in many cases, more toxic than its original form. SP Detox Balance delivers key nutrients. Phase II: Neutralize The highly toxic substances produced in Phase I convert to non-toxic molecules and become even more water-soluble. SP Detox Balance delivers key nutrients. Phase III: Eliminate Water-soluble toxins leave cells, and the body eliminates them. SP Detox Balance delivers plant-based fiber to aid toxin elimination. Program Options The program features two options - a 28-day or 10-day plan. After patients take the Toxicity Questionnaire, health care practitioners will recommend one of the options based on their results. Patients will then follow a simple regimen in the Program Guide, including the required number of shakes per day. Just mix the SP Detox Balance powder with water (or other approved beverage) and enjoy - morning, noon, or night!
