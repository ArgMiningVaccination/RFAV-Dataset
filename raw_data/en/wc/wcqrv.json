This smart drug sells on the mere assumption that it's potent and can rapidly improve your cognitive performance. Is that true? Is Noopept safe? In this article, we take an in-depth look into Noopept, it's purported benefits, legal status, and alternatives. We'll also explore some questions users have and their answers. Key Takeaways: Noopept Noopept Overview: What Is It? brand name for N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester. This synthetic smart drug is quite popular among students and professionals, who use it as a general multipurpose nootropic agent taken in daily doses. Just like with other popular nootropics, Noopept benefits you by enhancing your cognitive function, improving your memory consolidation and recall, reducing brain fog, and helping to regulate your moods. As a cognitive stimulant, Noopept claims to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-anxiety effects, while also improving blood flow to the brain. These three factors can also reduce neurotoxicity, preventing free radicals from destroying neurons and other cells in your brain. Noopept, in this right, also claims to help fight mild cognitive disorders and diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Piracetam and Noopept have similar mechanisms of action, according to many studies that have compared the two. However, Noopept is 1000 times stronger, and requires much smaller doses for similar effects [[1]](#1). Potential Benefits Several preliminary studies have investigated the potential benefits of using Noopept. None of them, however, give any firm conclusions on the safety or efficacy of its use. That's why the benefits below are still tentative. Plenty of clinical research is underway to confirm them. Boost Memory and Cognition Noopept can help you increase your cognitive capacity and recall ability. It also reduces your risk of cognitive decline. Recent studies show that with just one dose of this drug, you may experience an increase in your ability to learn new things [[2]](#2). In several animal studies done on rats, a single dose of Noopept and chronic dosing of a similar amount over 28 days led to a notable increase of their nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [[3]](#3). Increased NGF and BDNF lead to cognitive enhancement and improved memory function. It also leads to long-term memory enhancement in rats. Researchers believe this may be the case for humans as well, but this hypothesis is yet to prove true. In another study conducted on people with cerebrovascular deficiencies, 20 mg of Noopept was more effective than 1200 mg of piracetam at improving their global Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores showing a cognitive enhancement from use [[4]](#4). These results were clearer in persons with post-traumatic cerebral insufficiency and impaired brain function. However, researchers failed to replicate such results in people with normal human brains. Nevertheless, it spoke to Noopept's ability to improve cognition in people with brain trauma. Compared to piracetam, N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester is more effective at improving cognitive processes [[4]](#4). Despite [promising results](https://transparentpharmacy.net/pain-care.html), researchers need to conduct more studies on more human subjects before making concrete statements on Noopept's ability to improve brain health.

No hard evidence exists to support these claims. However, preliminary studies have also shown early promise in this case. A clinical study on Noopept benefits on patients with cognitive disorders resulting from traumatic brain injury or stroke showed that it improved their emotional states [[4]](#4). Almost half of subjects who used a 10 mg dose reported a reduction in fatigue, brain fog, irritability, and anxiety. Noopept also improved their mental stability within a week of using it. They also reported other benefits, including sleep improvement and reduced occurrence of headaches. Besides that, they reported improved moods and better wakefulness as well. While these results show Noopept's ability to regulate moods and emotions, more research on larger clinical samples will provide better insights into how this works. May Reduce Stress Noopept acts to potentially help you reduce oxidative stress in your brain, reducing your risk of age-related cognitive decline. According to studies conducted on rats, this nootropic reduces the activities of stress-induced proteins [[5]](#5). Although the mechanism of stress is slightly different in humans, these studies suggest results could be similar in people who use Noopept. Researchers need to conduct more clinical studies to determine just how effective Noopept is on helping users reduce stress and enhance their mental performance. May Have Positive Effects on Neurological Disorders Preliminary evidence from research shows that Noopept can have a positive effect on mechanisms that cause cognitive impairment or Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease [[6]](#6). In an Alzheimer's disease model study on mice, injections of Noopept seven days before treatment prevented them from experiencing amnesia from amyloid injections. These mice also coped better when they received more Noopept injections after receiving amyloid [[7]](#7). In a study on its effect on cells, Noopept helped prevent oxidative damage and mitochondrial cell death [[8]](#8) These two factors are essential in fighting Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Noopept also showed neuroprotective features whose primary function is preventing cell death from amyloid toxicity, a primary cause of these two disorders [[9]](#9). More tests on living animals and humans will help determine how long-lasting these effects are. Side Effects of Noopept N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester has the potential to cause certain side effects when used as nootropic supplements. Because Noopept has not undergone extensive studies, there isn't enough data available regarding its effects on human users or the frequency thereof. However, here are some side effects of Noopept you may experience: - Brain fog. - Confusion. - Drowsiness. - Lack of focus. - Anxiety. - Fatigue. - Irritability. - Seizures. These side effects are normally mild if experienced, especially in the majority of users. Is Noopept Safe To Take? Generally, Noopept is safe to take. However, studies on its side effects and long-term health risks remain elusive. We cannot state with any certainty if this nootropic is safe to use for extended periods. No evidence exists to show any long-lasting damage from using Noopept. Before taking Noopept or any other nootropic supplement, make sure you read its instructions and medical disclaimer before use. However, we strongly advise you to seek the advice of a professional doctor before taking Noopept or any other nootropic drug. You may need a full assessment before any Noopept administration, especially if you have a history of memory loss, headaches, cognitive disturbances, or seizures. Noopept may also have adverse drug interactions with other medicines, although so far, there are no recorded cases. How Does Noopept Work? Noopept works using two mechanisms. It increases the release of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and by influencing neurotransmitter systems. As a cycloprolylglycine prodrug, it causes production of BDNF in your brain. BDNF supports the growth and differentiation of new neural cells [[10]](#10). An increase in BDNF increases neuron density in the brain, leading to the formation of new neurotransmitters. This increase leads to enhanced cognitive performance on different metrics, including memory formation, focus, speech fluency, and learning [[10]](#10). Noopept also increases the nerve growth factor, promoting neuroplasticity in different regions of your brain at the same time. It also works on certain neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, including AMPA, a glutamate receptor. AMPA glutamate receptors ensure fast transmission of synapses in your central nervous system. It also promotes the availability of acetylcholine in the brain. Rather than increasing its amount, Noopept increases the number of free acetylcholine receptors at the synapse. This leads to improved brain health, an increase in focus, learning ability, verbal fluency, and to some extent, muscle function. Long Term Effects of Noopept Noopept has high bioavailability and will cross the blood-brain barrier with ease [[11]](#11). It also breaks down and leaves the body much faster. For this reason, Noopept is a fast-acting nootropic supplement, not a long-term one. However, you may enjoy the health benefits of increased neuropeptide availability in the long run, as it helps to improve your overall brain health and enhance cognitive function. Duration of Effects Noopept kicks in within 20 minutes of ingesting it. Because of its bioavailability, Noopept is one of the fastest nootropics to take effect in the body. You'll enjoy maximum benefits of your dose within 60 minutes of ingestion, then its effects will quickly dissipate over a couple of hours. In some rare cases, these effects may last up to 3 hours after use, according to Noopept reviews. However, to enjoy long-lasting effects from the action of BDNF and NGF, you'll have to use Noopept supplements consistently for several weeks. Half-Life: What Is It? Fast-acting drugs normally have a short half-life, and that's also the case with Noopept. It has a 60-90 minute half-life depending on your weight, physiology, and dose ingested. Such a short half-life means that within 60-90 minutes, your body clears half of your dose. Taking Noopept: Dosage Options You can take Noopept supplement in one of three options: oral, sublingual, or intranasal. Oral Noopept is most common in capsule form, which you can swallow. This is by far the easiest way to ingest Noopept. It's also the safest, because you don't need to measure the oral dosage yourself. These capsules are also palatable, and there's no bitter aftertaste once you swallow them. Besides that, you can carry this supplement around with ease. You can also store them with little worry, as the capsules can last for extended periods. If you want to try out this product safely, then use its oral option. You can stop using it at any time. Sublingual You can also ingest this nootropic by dissolving Noopept powder under your tongue. Using it this way allows you to bypass your digestive system, which means it won't break down before entering your bloodstream. Using sublingual Noopept gives more potent results than using capsules. However, in its powder form, it may be unpalatable for some users. Moreover, a fast absorption rate increases your risk of experiencing adverse side effects, especially if you're new to this nootropic supplement. Mega A megadose is a Noopept serving that ranges from 50 to 100 mg. In certain cases, a megadose may even exceed these limits. Noopept users can take high doses if they're trying to achieve massive improvements in memory, intelligence, and cognition fast. We recommend you take a megadose just once a week at most. For beginners, avoid megadoses until you have a proper tolerance buildup. They can be dangerous to some people. Besides that, using a megadose every so often reduces its efficacy in the long run. Legal Status of Noopept Depending on the state, country, or territory you're in, Noopept may be a drug regulated under the laws of your jurisdiction. Just because it's legal or unregulated in your country doesn't mean it isn't regulated elsewhere. Here, we'll look at the legality of Noopept in different places across the world. Is Noopept Legal in the US? In the United States, regulation on a substance means it's scheduled or controlled under the law. At the time of this writing, Noopept has no rules, making it unregulated. You can legally purchase, possess, and use it within the US. You can purchase it for personal use without restrictions, whether online or from other countries. Note, however, that Noopept has neither been submitted to or tested by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be considered 'approved'. The FDA has not approved it for any dietary or medical use, and that means you may face some limitations in marketing or selling Noopept supplements. These restrictions apply to suppliers and retailers, not consumers. Is Noopept Legal in the UK? It's no longer possible to purchase, resell, or distribute this nootropic, even under the brand name Noopept in the UK. As of 2016, the UK government listed it as a banned substance [[12]](#12). You won't be able to access these synthetic nootropics, even from Nootropics Depot, or any other US or Canadian wholesalers. Is Noopept Legal in Europe? The European case is slightly more complicated. The definition of 'drug' varies from government to government, making it difficult to determine if Noopept is legal in the EU. Some European countries may allow you to import Noopept for personal use without restriction, while others may enforce strict laws against its use. Is Noopept Legal in Canada? In Canada, Noopept does not have a Drug Identification Number. Because it's also not registered with the Canadian FDA, you cannot import, resell, or distribute Noopept. However, since Noopept is not a scheduled or controlled drug, you can import it for personal use. Where Can You Buy Noopept? You can purchase Noopept synthetic nootropics directly from Nootropics Depot. Also, some supplement manufacturers sell their products directly to the market. This wholesaler is one of the largest suppliers of nootropics in the US. However, you can still buy Noopept from many other online stores, including Amazon.

Noopept increases the levels of dopamine in your brain. An increase in BDNF in your brain causes neuron density to increase, leading to an increase in dopamine levels. Is Noopept the Best Nootropic? Although popular among students and professors, Noopept is not the best nootropic. It may be 1000 times stronger than piracetam, but that doesn't mean it's the best. Other alternatives exist. They may even be safer, considering plenty of research has not established just how powerful Noopept is as a nootropic. How Does Noopept Make You Feel? Noopept will make you feel a change in your capacity for recall, and you'll remember things from long ago. Besides that, you may feel some side effects like extreme exhaustion a few hours after use. Otherwise, Noopept is not a stimulant, and it will not give you an energy boost. What Is the Best Nootropic for Motivation? Some nootropics are better for motivation than others. Take a look at this list of top [nootropics for motivation](https://www.farrinstitute.org/nootropics-for-motivation/) for more information. What Is Noopept Good For?
