We call bullshit on this highly marketed weight loss craze that can be found in any supplement store or online google search. For those who know me and have sat through a nutrition class or even talked nutrition with me for a few minutes know that I'm quick to dismiss the garbage that floats around promising quick fixes and jump starts to weight loss. There actually is not any research data on the effectiveness of these diets in the medical literature according to Harvard Health Publishing. There have been numerous studies done that have shown \"cleansing\" diets consisting of low calorie intake will lower the basal metabolic rate in order to conserve energy. Once the individual resumes to normal eating habits they experience rapid weight gain. So why do people experience a quick loss in weight when they partake in cleansing diets or detox supplements? The weight loss is mainly fluid loss due to a dangerously low intake of carbohydrates or peeing out of your butt produced by salt water, laxative tea or whatever detox supplement you are throwing down your hatch. Once the cleanse/detox period is over and the individual resumes normal eating, guess what, the weight comes back on quickly. Some of the red flags and risks involved are the lack of protein intake, dehydration, electrolyte depletion (Gatorade does not replenish electrolytes, FYI), and irritation of the digestive system. Repeating this habit can even lead to metabolic acidosis which is a chemical imbalance of acids and bases in your blood. The bottom line is that if it sounds too good to be true, it is. Many products sold online, in stores, at spas and through multilevel marketing companies promise to \"cleanse\" or \"detoxify\" your body. Dietary supplements are poorly regulated, and the people selling these products may not understand the science behind them or are just trying to make a profit. In general, detoxes and cleanses don't promote health and longevity, and there is little evidence or research that \"detoxification\" actually occurs. The level of effort needed to follow certain guidelines is typically high, with strict limitations regarding what food may be consumed, how it needs to be prepared and in what combinations it needs to be eaten. Strong suggestions also accompany the use of pills, powders, tea, etc. So what is actually in those detox supplements? Some cleanses like Herbalife, Isagenix, and others contain high doses of low heat nonfat dry milk (denatured skim milk), which often cause stomach and skin issues for those who do not typically consume higher levels of dairy products. On top of that they contain artificial sweeteners, maltodextrin and isolated fructose, as well as preservatives and artificial vitamins. They also contain only around 250 calories per meal replacement, which is less than what my 30 pound dog consumes daily. Many of those who consume these cleanses report ongoing hungriness, dizziness, and overall fatigue. This is because your body is not being fueled properly, but likely going through starvation. When this happens, your body actually stores the energy you put into it as fat in order to sustain. Our body has it's own \"detox\" system. How else do you think 70% of us can consume such a shitty diet and continue to function. Our \"detox\" system is comprised of the skin, the respiratory system, the immune system, the small & large intestines, the liver and kidneys. Together they do an amazing job of detoxing our bodies and, thereby, making nutrients ready to be absorbed into the bloodstream. If you are generally healthy and free of disease, your body is detoxing itself around the clock. Cleanses & detoxes do not produce long-term health results. If you want health & wellness then you need to make a commitment to eat healthy by consuming lean meats, veggies, some fruit, little starch and no sugar (simply put). Exercise on a regular basis and decrease processed/fast food. Our culture has become so enamored with a quick fix pill or shake to lose weight and feel healthier, when in reality, real foods are the best medicine you can get. Sacrificing your health in the short term to lose weight and see if a magical cleanse really works will only leave you with mud butt and disappointment in the long run. "}
