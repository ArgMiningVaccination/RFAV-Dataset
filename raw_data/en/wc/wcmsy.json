(AP Photo) (AP Photo) \"Fat\" may be the new normal in the United States, according to [WalletHub](https://wallethub.com/edu/fattest-states/16585/). HIGHEST % OF PHYSICALLY INACTIVE RESIDENTS 1. Mississippi 2. Tennessee 3. Arkansas 4. Oklahoma 5. Louisiana More than three-fourths of American adults are now either overweight or obese, according to a [report](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2323411) that used data from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/). And, for the first time ever, there are more [obese](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm) Americans than there are people who are overweight. Obesity is defined as when 30 percent or more of a person's body weight comes from fat. Americans have gotten dramatically fatter over the last couple of decades and experts say there are a variety of reasons for that. \"This is obviously a reflection of a generation of decreased physical activity and changing diets that are not healthy,\" said Jeffrey Levi, executive director of [Trust for America's Health](http://healthyamericans.org/). \"The biggest concern...is not just the number of people who are obese, but the large number of people who are suffering from severe obesity and that condition is where we see the most dire health consequences and can become life-threatening.\" More than one-fourth of Americans ages 6 and up were completely inactive in 2014, according to the [Physical Activity Council](http://www.physicalactivitycouncil.com/pressrelease/). That means more than 28 percent of Americans didn't participate in individual or team sports, didn't go to the gym, or camp, or walk for exercise, or even stretch. \"The high rate of inactivity is fundamentally alarming. We have almost 83 million Americans living totally sedentary lives,\" said council chairman Tom Cove in a press release. The lack of physical activity, along with over-sized food portions, lack of access to healthy food, not getting enough sleep, and genetics, all [contribute](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/obe/causes) to being overweight or obese. In the graphic above, a rank of No. 1 corresponds to the state with the biggest weight problems. Click on each state to see where it ranks. The states with the most obese adult residents are Mississippi, West Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky. The fewest obese adults are found in California, Utah, Massachusetts, District of Columbia, Hawaii and Colorado. When it comes to children, the highest obesity rates are found in Mississippi, South Carolina, District of Columbia, Louisiana and Tennessee. The states with the lowest percentage of obese children are Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, New Jersey and Oregon. A new [analysis](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/11/1923.abstract) finds the severely obese cost the nation almost $69 billion in 2013. \"The good news is that in our annual reviews, we're finding that obesity rates have become more stable among adults,\" said Levi. \"Only a handful of states have seen very small increase in the adult obesity rate. The bad news is that they are settling in at very high rates that have tremendous public health and quality of life consequences.\" Comments welcome.

Middle-aged white people without a college degree are dying faster than other Americans, according to researchers from Princeton University. (Photo by Flickr user Andy via Creative Commons license) Middle-aged white people without a college degree are dying faster than other Americans, according to researchers from Princeton University. Thanks to medical advances and preventative measures, overall death rates in the United States have fallen in the last century. However, death rates for white people between the ages of 45 and 54 have increased by one-half a percent per year since 1998, said Anne Case and Angus Deaton of Princeton University. Deaton was awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace for economics last month. Case and Deaton believe drug and alcohol overdoses, as well as suicide, are behind the rise in midlife mortality. Mortality by cause, white non-Hispanics ages 45-54 (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: \"Rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st century\") \"Midlife increases in suicides and drug poisonings have been previously noted,\" the [researchers wrote](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/29/1518393112.full.pdf). \"However, that these upward trends were persistent and large enough to drive up all-cause midlife mortality has, to our knowledge, been overlooked.\" People in this age group were more likely to report an increase in poor health as well as an increase in pain, including neck pain, facial pain, chronic joint pain, and sciatica. The study found the hardest hit were those without a college degree. Death rates increased more than 20 percent from 1999 and 2013 for middle-aged people without a college education, while they actually fell for those who did earn a college degree. Death rates for whites with only a high school diploma are the highest of any race or ethnic group at 736 per 100,000. That could suggest that setbacks at this stage of life \u2014 such as job loss or health concerns \u2014 could prove particularly difficult for this group of Americans. \"After the productivity slowdown in the early 1970s, and with widening income inequality, many of the baby-boom generation are the first to find, in midlife, that they will not be better off than their parents were,\" the researchers wrote. Death rate for people aged 45-54: US White non-Hispanics (USW), US Hispanics (USH), and six comparison countries: France (FRA), Germany (GER), the United Kingdom (UK), Canada (CAN), Australia (AUS), and Sweden (SWE) (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: \"Rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st century\") No other rich countries have experienced a similar trend, according to study. Since 1998, mortality rates in developed countries continued to drop by 2 percent each year while US white non-Hispanic mortality rose by half a percent a year.

However, while white death rates \u2014 including those with and without a college education \u2014 are up, they're still not as high as black death rates.

The country's first great wave of immigrants arrived from Ireland and Germany. In 1850, the Irish were the nation's largest immigrant group, settling primarily on the East Coast and in Southern states. Then came the Age of Mass Migration\u2014from 1850 to 1913\u2014one of the largest migration episodes in modern history, when almost 30 million immigrants moved to the United States. At the time, American borders were completely open to European immigrants. By the 1880s, the Germans were the nation's largest foreign-born group in many Midwestern and Southern states. An Italian immigrant - date unknown (William Williams papers /Augustus Sherman photographs/New York Public Library) In 1880, Chinese were the biggest immigrant group in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Nevada. However, when the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricted their entry into the United States, other foreign-born groups overtook them in those states. By the early 1900s, another great influx of immigrants arrived from Southern and Eastern Europe. The 1930s saw Italians become the largest foreign-born group in the country and in nine states, including New York, Louisiana, New Jersey and Nevada. The make-up of immigrants changed again after 1965. Mexicans became the largest foreign-born group in the country by the 1980s, and by 2013 were the largest immigrant group in 33 states.

Most Americans Think Science, Religion Conflict (Photo by Flickr user Richard Howes via Creative Commons license) A majority of Americans, 59 percent, believe science often conflicts with religion, while 38 percent say the two areas are mostly compatible The most religious Americans are less likely to believe that religion and science conflict with each other, a new [Pew Research poll ](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/22/science-and-religion/)finds. People with no particular religious affiliation, or who are not religiously observant, are most inclined to think religion and science generally clash. One of the biggest areas of contention involves how humans came to be. Two-thirds of Americans \u2014 65 percent \u2014 say humans evolved over time. Some see a contradiction between the Theory of Evolution \u2014 which holds that humans evolved from other animals over time \u2014 and core tenets of the Christian faith, particularly the belief that a supreme being created life and the Universe. The debate over evolution and whether it should be taught to American schoolchildren was so heated that it eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 the highest court in the United States. In 1925, the southern state of Tennessee passed a bill banning the teaching of evolution at all of the state's educational institutions. John Scopes, a high school science teacher in the state, [challenged the law](https://www.aclu.org/state-tennessee-v-scopes) by teaching evolution to his students. He was arrested and convicted, only to have his conviction overturned by the state supreme court. The law was never enforced in Tennessee again. The issue finally reached the U.S. Supreme Court 40 years later, after Susan Epperson, a Zoology teacher in Arkansas, challenged a state law that banned teaching students that \"mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals.\" In 1968, the Supreme Court, unanimously declared the Arkansas law unconstitutional. Today, according to the Pew poll, about 1 in 3 Americans \u2014 31 percent \u2014 think humans did not evolve and have always existed in their present form. White evangelical Protestants \u2014 60 percent of them \u2014 are more likely than people in other major religious groups to believe this view. However, 1 in 4 Americans \u2014 24 percent \u2014 seems to believe in something of a gray area between evolution and creationism, saying human evolution occurred with the guidance of \"a supreme being.\" That's in keeping with a [2014 survey](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k8pm1s48uaqvvm3/NSRHO%20Report.pdf?dl=0) that studied the public's beliefs about human origins in depth and found there were people who ascribed to a sort of theistic evolutionism \u2014 the belief that God or a divine intelligence was somehow behind evolution. \"I was surprised at the level of sort of disarray over these beliefs,\" said Jonathan Hill, assistant professor of Sociology at Calvin College, who conducted the study. \"Their views are rather fragmented, so yes, they could affirm an Adam and Eve and at the same time affirm evolution...the real world and beliefs that people hold on this are very messy.\" Hill found that the more he drilled down and asked people about their views on creationism in greater detail, the less certain people were about historical claims in the bible. \"It tells me there are elites in society who are invested in one narrative or another,\" Hill said. \"They're very articulate and they have a lot to gain, one way or another, about a particular narrative about human origins, but it does say that a large swathe of the public isn't on board with either of those programs.\" The US melting pot often influences the best foods to eat in each state.

[Busbud](https://www.busbud.com/blog/top-instagrammed-locations/) explored which locations are mentioned most on the photo-sharing app, which claims to have 300 million monthly users, and came up with a diverse list that includes everything from wineries and vineyards, to historic sites and wildlife areas. Parks and geographic landmarks are the most common attractions on the list. The extreme wilderness of Denali National Park in Alaska, a 6 million-acre preserve with beautiful views, diverse wildlife and North America's tallest mountain is the top Instagrammed location in Alaska. In the South, the beaches of South Carolina and Tennessee's Dollywood theme park are tops, along with two racetracks: Georgia's Atlantic Motor Speedway and North Carolina's Charlotte Motor Speedway. In the American Northeast, ballparks, landmarks, and beaches are among the locations mentioned featured most often on the photo-sharing app. In the West, there are many natural splendors to choose from, including Montana's Glacier National Park, home to more than a million acres of forests, alpine meadows, lakes and valleys in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Its more than 2.3 million visitors in 2014 make Glacier the tenth most-visited park in the nation. The Grand Canyon, also a western wonder, is the second most popular national park with more than 4.7 million annual visitors. Next to parks, vineyards and wineries are the most popular locations on Instagram. There are [7,762 wineries](http://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?section=news&content=127266) in the United States, 3,674 of them are in California.

Americans fear US government corruption and cyber-terrorism more than terrorism, according to a new survey from Chapman University. (Photo by Flickr user Florian F. via Creative Commons license) Americans are more afraid of U.S. government corruption than they are of potential terrorist attacks. According to a [Chapman University survey,](https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2015/10/13/americas-top-fears-2015/) 58 percent of people say they were either afraid or very afraid of corruption on the part of government officials, while 44.4 percent report fearing man-made disasters such as a terrorist attack. Government corruption tops a list of 88 potential fears and anxieties that 1,541 people from across the country were asked about. Almost half of Americans say they fear cyber terrorism and having their online information tracked by the government and corporations. The survey broke fear down into 10 major domains, including categories such as crime, personal anxieties and technology, as well as man-made and natural disasters. The other top 10 fears include corporate tracking of personal information, terror attacks, bio-warfare, identity theft, running out of money and credit card fraud. Ultimately people seem to be more afraid of disasters created by man than those nature dishes out. The most-feared natural disasters are pandemics, rather than hurricanes or earthquakes, and when it comes to personal anxieties, fear of reptiles tops the list. Global warming is the main environmental concern and when it comes to daily life, death is what people fear the most. Other fears include war, heights, insects, loneliness and the dark.

At the turn of the century, just before the United States entered World War I, German Americans accounted for about 10 percent of the population and their presence was keenly felt. \"They were very proud and they clung to their culture very strongly. They still spoke German everywhere...They were almost arrogantly proud of what they thought was a superior German culture and a lot of them didn't want to integrate and assimilate in the United States,\" said Erik Kirschbaum, author of [Burning Beethoven: The Eradication of German Culture in the United States during World War I](http://www.berlinica.com/burning-beethoven.html). \"They wanted to preserve their culture and keep it intact as long as they could.\" German immigrants flocked to New York and Chicago, and residents in numerous small Midwestern towns spoke German almost exclusively. German-language newspapers, theaters and churches flourished. In some of these areas, the German influence was so pervasive that other non-German settlers ended up learning German so they could communicate with fellow residents. Germans helped establish General Electric and designed New York's Brooklyn Bridge. They dominated the beer industry and that influence lingers in name brands like Busch, Miller and Pabst. Dormitory for interned Germans at Fort Douglas, Utah. (Library of Congress) The situation took a dark turn for German Americans when the United States entered World War I. Suddenly, as anti-German hysteria swept the country, America's largest, most powerful minority was considered suspect. \"A lot of people thought the country was filled with spies and saboteurs and actually 30 Germans were killed by mobs and lynch mobs,\" said Kirschbaum, whose own grandfather grew up speaking German but refused to speak in the language in his later years. Shortly after declaring war on Germany, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson required about 250,000 German-born men \u2014 aged fourteen and older \u2014 to register their address and employment at their local post office. Within a year, that order was expanded to include women. About 6,000 of these people were arrested and 2,000 of them, who were deemed \"dangerous\", were sent to internment camps. German language books were taken out of schools and libraries and burned by so-called patriotic organizations that wanted to make sure German was eradicated from the American landscape. Kirschbaum says German Americans, who saw Germany as their mother and America as their wife, felt they had to make a choice. \"They suddenly realized they can't be both German and American,\" he said. \"And after the war, a lot of them felt they had to assimilate, there was no choice and a lot of them did. A lot of them became thoroughly American. They stopped speaking German. They stopped teaching their children German. They stopped reading German newspapers and they became whole-hearted Americans.\" And in doing so, much of the German culture they'd proudly held onto for so long, slowly vanished from the American landscape. Today, Kirschbaum sees disturbing parallels between the anti-German sentiment that swept the nation a century ago and the rise of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S. since the September 11, 2001 attacks. \"There's definitely a parallel between the United States government turning sauerkraut into liberty cabbage during World War I and some people in Congress trying to change the term French fries into freedom fries after 9/11,\" he said. \"It's another sad chapter in American history that perhaps could have been prevented or avoided if more Americans knew about the history and the way they persecuted German Americans 100 years ago.\" (Teaser photo by Flickr user [momentcaptured1 ](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pat_ossa/5054849987/in/photolist-8GFqMZ-8FrGKd-8ForRp-8FrCDj-8FrCJY-5jYL7o-8FTRJk-8Fddws-8Fddk5-8Fa2Q6-8FddD1-8Fa3JD-5jYL5Y-8Fa3Bn-8GFqDi-8Fddbf-8GaLpD-8GaMbx-8FX4BJ-8GdX9E-8GdWUG-8FFRos-37JV1J-8FTRRx-8FFRMW-8FFRtm-8FTSg4-8FTS1R-8FX4oE-8FFREo-37JTtE-37JUcJ-6Z4FFU-g29eAv-4VNFD-5ke2uL-8E4L5S-8E4KXE-8E4KQm-8E4Lfd-8E1C98-37JXhJ-6YZJEV-8F9QKt-6ZHr2X-6ZH5vH-6ZHfRZ-6ZHK22-6ZH5jT-6ZHwkv)via Creative Commons license) Why So Many US Koreans Run Dry Cleaners While Arabs Are Grocers (File) Korean immigrant-owned Custom Dry Cleaners with store co-owner Chung Soo (R) and her daughter-in-law Choi Soo (C) behind the counter, with local customer Victory Hucks (L) in Washington, D.C.

Economists William Kerr, of Harvard Business School, and Martin Mandroff, of the Swedish Competition Authority, studied the relationship between ethnicity, occupational choice, and entrepreneurship. They [found](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21597) that ethnic groups in the United States tend to concentrate in certain businesses and that these small, socially-isolated groups attain considerable financial success through this type of concentrated entrepreneurship. FILE \u2014 Rae Alzaweny, owner of the Iraq Market grocery store, sorts produce in Dearborn, Michigan. (AP Photo) According to Kerr and Mandroff, Yemenis are 75 times more likely to own grocery stores than other immigrants, while Greeks tend to concentrate in the restaurant sector, and Middle Eastern immigrants are more likely to own grocery and liquor stores. The researchers say people decide what industry to enter based on their interactions. The tendency to cluster around certain industries often results because market interactions \u2014 such as with corporate America or in higher education \u2014 can prove more challenging for certain members of ethnic groups. Consequently, they rely more on social interactions \u2014 with friends, family or people within their ethnic group \u2014 to learn new skills and find jobs. This tendency to own their own business is more apparent among some groups. For example, 45 percent of adult Korean males are self-employed. That's three times higher than the 15 percent self-employed rate of the general adult male immigrant population. As business owners, these immigrant groups have to rely on their own judgment and they tend to learn from each other. \"When socializing during family gatherings and religious/cultural functions, entrepreneurs mentor each other and exchange industry knowledge and professional advice,\" the authors wrote. \"The more an entrepreneur socializes with other entrepreneurs, the more knowledge is exchanged. Social interaction and production are therefore complementary in the entrepreneurial sector and entrepreneurial productivity increases with the number of friends and family members in that sector.\" \"From Social Networks, Ethnicity and Entrepreneurship\" by William "}
