Attempts will be made to affiliate with professional teams, performing art organizations and with other special events in the community. The hours gained during the clinical education rotations will count towards the 1000 total hours necessary to fulfill course requirements for graduation. In all clinical education rotations, students will be supervised by a certified and state licensed Athletic Trainer or an approved allied health care professional whom is a Preceptor associated with the University's Athletic Training Program. The majority of the clinical education hours obtained by the Athletic Training Student will occur between the hours of 6:00am and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. However, clinical education rotations also include completing clinical education during Summer, Fall and Spring Breaks, Saturdays and Sundays, and may traveling with the supervision of a preceptor. 9 RETENTION POLICY Once admitted into the University, students who declare Athletic Training as their major will be designated as Pre-Athletic Training students. Students will be required to follow the course sequence form for their freshman and sophomore years. Following the successful completion of the retention process in the spring of the sophomore year, students will be formally admitted into the clinical portion of the Athletic Training Program. At this time, students will be designated as Athletic Training majors (ATHT). More information about this process will be discussed when the student enrolls in KIN 140 and again in KIN 210. Retention Requirements: \u00a8 Completion of KIN 140, 141, 145, 202, 210, 230, 232, 235, 345, and 234 is required. A grade of \"B\" (3.0) or better in KIN 140, 141, 145, and 210 is required. \u00a8 Students starting the program as true freshman should take KIN 184 and KIN 212 during their freshman year. Students starting the major after the freshman year must take KIN 184 and KIN 212 during the course of the program. \u00a8 A cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or better and an Athletic Training major GPA of 3.0 or better \u00a8 Submission of a written essay of career goals and objectives to the Program Director \u00a8 Interview with the Retention Committee (Program Director, Clinical Education Coordinator, Head Athletic Trainer, Department Chair, and an Assistant Athletic Trainer) \u00a8 Two letters of recommendation from faculty, staff, or professionals outside of the AT Program faculty RETENTION EVALUATION CRITERIA (50 point total =100%) Overall GPA = 15 points (30%) o GPA points will be as follows: 4.0 - 3.5 = 15 - 13 pts., 3.4 - 3.0 = 12 - 10 pts., 2.9 - 2.5 = 9 - 7 pts. o A cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or better and an Athletic Training major GPA of 3.0 or better is required. o A letter grade of \"B\" (3.0) or better in KIN 140, 141, 145, and 210 is required o Completion of the following courses with a grade point average of 3.0 or better is required: *KIN 140, *KIN 141, *KIN 145, *KIN 202, *KIN 210, KIN 230, KIN 234, KIN 235, and KIN 34. Completion of 85 clinical observation hours = 10 points (20%) Interview = 15 points (30%) o Interview will take place once each year around April 15th with the members of the Retention Committee. Recommendation Letters= 10 points (20%) 10 o Each recommendation will be scored on a scale of 1-5 points with 5 being the highest score possible. The sum of the two recommendations will be recorded, with 10 being the maximum score possible. The totals from each of the retention criteria areas are tabulated and reviewed for student retention. Those students that achieve a score of 80% or higher on the Retention Criteria will remain in good standing within the Athletic Training Program. Once the retention process has been completed during the spring semester of the sophomore year, the student will be notified approximately late -May of the on the decision of their retention status in the Athletic Training Program. Students who are not successful in meeting the retention criteria to the program will not be permitted to take athletic training clinical courses until the retention criteria has been met. Students may be allowed to continue on a probationary basis at the discretion of the Program Director and Retention Committee. If after the second attempt, the student does not meet the retention criteria to the program, they will be strongly encouraged to seek academic options other than Athletic Training. 11 ACADEMIC PROBATION/DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Students enrolled in the Athletic Training Program must maintain a university cumulative grade point average 2.5 or higher on a 4.0 scale. Athletic Training is an allied health care profession and academic performance should be a priority in the AT Program. The Athletic Training Student (ATS) must maintain a major grade point average of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale in the athletic training major. A student may repeat a course, but the repetition will not eliminate the previous grade from the record. A course may be repeated only once unless written authorization is provided by the chair of the department in which the course is offered or, in the case of an undepartmentalized school, by the dean. Athletic Training courses in which the ATS earns a grade of \"C-\" (1.7) or below must retake that course. The initial grade and the repeat grade are included in the computation of the cumulative grade point average for both the university and the AT Program. If the initial grade was a \"C-\"(1.7) and the repeat grade is passing, the number of credits required for graduation will be increased by the number of credits repeated. Athletic Training Students that fail to meet these standards (3.0 major GPA and a C or higher in major classes) will be placed on academic probation for one semester during which time the clinical hours will be restricted to those required by athletic training courses the ATS is currently enrolled in. A student that is placed on probation will be given a verbal and written warning, including a possible disciplinary action, if not corrected. The ATS must also meet with the Program Director on a regular basis to ensure academic improvement. The probationary student should continue to see the Program Director periodically throughout the semester for study hall assignments, tutoring services and other counseling. End of the semester grade reports will be collected and sent directly to the Program Director for all students within the AT Program. If a student is placed on academic probation for a total of 2 semesters, either consecutively or inconsecutively, he/she is then subject to removal from the AT Program. The student will meet with the Program Director of the AT Program and will be given a written dismissal verification notice. A copy will be filed in the student's academic file maintained by the Program Director. The student does have the right to follow a formal appeals process and seek options other than athletic training or transfer to another institution. Any student in the AT Program has the right to appeal or petition any decision made by the AT Program Action Committee. The appeals process is as follows. The student will appeal in writing to the Program Director. If a student is not satisfied, he/she can appeal to the AT Program Retention Committee. The student may then appeal to the Chair of the Kinesiology and Sport Sciences Department and finally to the Academic and Student Services Committee in the School of Education and Human Development, and the University Ombudsperson. 12 STUDENT GRIEVANCES Troubleshooters Troubleshooters are faculty members and administrators who serve as a resource for students seeking assistance with academic and non-academic matters. When regular channels have failed to bring resolution to your problem and after you have spoken to the appropriate Troubleshooter, you should contact the Ombudsperson. The troubleshooter for the School of Education at https://ombuds.studentaffairs.miami.edu/who-can-help/academic-troubleshooters/index.html Ombudsperson An Ombudsperson interprets University policy for students and make recommendations to the central administration when policy changes are needed. The University of Miami has two Ombudspersons for students. The Academic Ombudsperson works most closely with issues with faculty, coursework, grade appeals, etc. The Administrative Ombudsperson works most closely with administrative issues such as financial registration, access concerns, and university polices and procedures. Ombudspersons connect students to faculty and administrators who will listen, answer questions, interpret policies/procedures and provide guidance on the appropriate steps to consider for a resolution. The Ombudspersons seek to resolve matters informally before they become matters in a formal grievance-appeal proceeding and works with students in establishing next steps to assist in their success at the University. However, if a formal grievance-appeal is most appropriate, they can provide guidance on the process. University Troubleshooters University Troubleshooters are faculty members and administrators who serve as a resource for students seeking assistance. They represent in a wide range of campus departments, who assist students with academic and administrative related matters. If a student has spoken to the appropriate University Troubleshooter and have not brought resolution to a student's concern, students should contact the Ombudsperson. For more information, visit miami.edu/ombudsperson, call 305-284-4922, email ombudsperson@miami.edu or visit Ashe building 244.

These costs may vary. 27 TECHNICAL STANDARDS FORM Athletic Training education requires that the accumulation of scientific knowledge be accompanied by the simultaneous acquisition of skills and professional attitudes and behavior. The University of Miami School of Education and Human Development, Department of Kinesiology & Sports Sciences, awards a Bachelor's of Science Athletic Training degree to students who successfully complete the curriculum. Students are expected to acquire a broad base of knowledge and skills, and competencies of an entry-level Athletic Trainer as well as meet the expectations of the program's accrediting agency, The Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). Bachelors of Science Athletic Training degree will be required to acquire the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. In order to learn the variety of tasks needed to become proficient as an Athletic Trainer, the student must be able to perform the following tasks, which are all essential requirements of the program: observation, communication, motor, conceptual (integrative and quantitative), and behavioral/social. Observation The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in basic and applied sciences, including, but not limited to human anatomy and physiology, neuroscience, as well as in didactic courses in Athletic Training theory and practice for normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation requires the use of common sense, as well as the functional use of the senses of vision, audition, olfaction, and palpation. Communication A candidate must be able to elicit information from patients, describe the patient's mood, activity and posture, and perceive and accurately report nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with coaches, administrators, patients and their families. Communication includes not only oral, but also reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently with all members of the health care team in both immediate and recorded modes. Motor Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, manual positioning of body segments and other evaluative procedures. A candidate must be able to do basic screening and examinations (physiological measures such as BP, HR and respiration), diagnostic procedures (palpation, manual muscle testing, goniometry, ligament laxity testing, sensory evaluation, gait analysis, balance assessment), and review X-rays. A candidate must be able to lift an adequate amount of weight (approximately 50 pounds) in order to assess and lift a patient as necessary. A candidate must be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of Athletic Training students are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, spine stabilization for head or neck injury and application of pressure to stop bleeding. Additionally, candidates must be able to perform debridement of wounds and other physical assessment maneuvers, where such actions require coordination of both gross and 28 fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Conceptual-Integrative and Quantitative Analysis These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, synthesis, and retention of complex information. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of Athletic Training practitioners, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral/Social Attitudes Candidates must possess the emotional health required for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to an evaluation, diagnosis and care of patients, and be able to develop mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically-taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments both indoor and outdoor, display flexibility and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and education process. Completion of the program's technical standards does not guarantee a student's eligibility for the Board of Certification (BOC) exam. Students requesting accommodation to meet the technical standards must contact the Office of Disability Services prior to the start of the program or immediately upon a change in health status. Students must read and sign indicating they understand the technical standards listed above that are required of students selected to participate in the Athletic Training Program and understand that they are essential requirements of the program. If for any reason, the student's health status changes, they are required to update their signature.

The Athletic Training Students also are encouraged to attend the various local, regional, and national conventions sponsored by these groups. These organizations provide many benefits including scholarships, informational services, educational symposiums, scholarly journals, lobbying of government agencies, and job placement services. Examples of professional organizations include the following: National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) Southeast Athletic Trainers' Association (SEATA) Athletic Trainers' Association of Florida (ATAF) Both the Hurricane Athletic Training Students and the Iota Tau Alpha student groups, require officers to members of the NATA prior to election. Membership and membership fee information can be found on the following websites: NATA: www.nata.org SEATA: www.seata.org ATAF: www.ataf.org NPI NUMBERS In addition, students are highly encouraged to apply for a NPI number. An NPI is a unique 10-digit identification number used in standard health care transactions. It is issued to health care professionals and covered entities that transmit standard HIPAA electronic transactions (e.g., electronic claims and claim status inquiries). The NPI fulfills a requirement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). It also replaces all provider identifier numbers assigned by payers and is used by health care professionals. Covered entities under HIPPA are required by regulation to use NPIs to identify health care providers in HIPPA standard transactions. Applying for your NPI is quick, easy and free. Visit the CMS National Plan & Provider Enumeration System to complete your application today. Follow the NATA Step-by-Step NPI Application Instructions to apply. . 32 CLINICAL EDUCATION OVERVIEW Students will receive clinical experiences at local colleges, high schools, and sports medicine clinics. Attempts will be made to affiliate with professional teams, and other organizations and with special events in the community. The hours gained during the clinical education rotations will count towards the 1000 total hours necessary to fulfill course requirements. In all clinical rotations, students will be supervised by a certified and state licensed Athletic Trainer or an approved allied health care professional whom is a preceptor associated with the University's Athletic Training Program. The majority of the clinical education hours obtained by the Athletic Training Student will occur between the hours of 7:00am and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. Clinical education rotations also include Saturday and Sunday events, returning prior to the start of the semesters, and traveling with the supervision of a preceptor. A Preceptor will supervise each student and evaluate each student on his/her performance and clinical proficiency. Refer to the Appendix for the evaluation tools utilized by the Preceptor. Clinical education must provide students with authentic, real-time opportunities to practice and integrate athletic training knowledge, skills, and clinical abilities, including decision-making and professional behaviors required of the profession in order to develop proficiency as an Athletic Trainer. 33 CLINICAL EDUCATION ROTATIONS All Athletic Training Students are required to have clinical experiences with: both a male and female sports; both in-season and out-of-season sports; protective equipment (i.e. football, lacrosse, hockey) adolescent patient population (i.e. high school) non-sports or other allied health care settings (i.e. Sports Medicine Clinic, Physical Therapy Clinics, Hospitals, and others) In addition, all ATS students will complete a minimum of: Eight Non-Ortho Interactions (observations and patient presentations) Twelve Orthopedic Physician Interactions (observations and patient presentations) Four surgery observations Approx. 100 clinical education hours of intermittent clinical immersion experiences, where a student completes full days of immersion in the daily roles and responsibilities of an Athletic Trainer (50 hours as a junior, and 50 hours as a senior). These immersions can occur anytime students are not in classes such as during pre-seasons, post-seasons, school holiday breaks, weekends, or during days when classes don't conflict with a full day immersion. These clinical hours can be spread out over several types of immersion experiences and over several days, weeks, or months. However, they must occur under the supervision of University of Miami approved preceptors and they must comply with the programs weekly maximum hour policy. These hours are part of and not in addition to the required clinical education hours for KIN 443 and KIN 455. Please see the Clinical Education Coordinator for more details. Also, note, this requirement is subject to change based on special circumstances and at the desertion of the instructor for KIN 443 and KIN 455. TRANSPORTATION TO CLINICAL SITES Students are responsible for their own transportation to and from all clinical education sites. This includes all associate costs. 34 DIRECT SUPERVISION The preceptor must be physically present and have the ability to intervene on behalf of the athletic training student to provide on-going and consistent education. In addition, the preceptor must consistently and physically interact with the athletic training student at the site of the clinical experience. The preceptor must provide direct supervision in the form of visual and auditory contact with the student. Some form of educational instruction is to be included during clinical education hours. The preceptor is to conduct a regularly scheduled weekly education session for all ATS. Educational instruction may take the form of discussion, demonstrations, or research. Athletic Training clinical education hours can only be obtained under the direct supervision of a preceptor. Direct supervision means the preceptor has direct visual and auditory contact with the ATS. The NATA, CAATE, and the AT Program at the University of Miami DO NOT endorse Athletic Training students working as First Responders or as First Aid Providers. Any hours during which a student is acting as a First Responder or a First Aid Provider are not considered clinical education hours and may be a violation of the Florida State Practice Act. 35 CINICALAL EDUCATION HOURS Clinical education hours accumulated under the direct supervision of a preceptor must be recorded by the ATS on the Athletic Training Hours Form. This form requires the documentation of the month, the year, the type athletic training experience, and the athletic training hours accumulated for each day. At the end of each day, the ATS must total the hours and obtain the signature of the preceptor. The ATS must then submit a copy of the signed Athletic Training Hours form to the Program Director and to the instructor of the course. The student must have a minimum of ten clinical education hours and no more than of 40 hours each week. Any exception to the minimum requirement must be approved by the CEC or PD. Clinical education hours cannot exceed 40 hours in a week and all ATS should have at least one day off a week from the clinical education site. Students must ensure that they obtain the required semester hour total while staying within the maximum and minimum hour's policy. The semester minimum policy is determined by the total number of hour required by clinical lab classes (Junior Spring = 150 for KIN 444 and 100 for KIN 261= 250-hour semester minimum, the semester maximum is calculated by the number of weeks in the semester x the weekly maximum of 40 hours per week (approx. 14weeks x 40-hour maximum). 36 CLINICAL EDUCATION GUIDELINES I have read and understand the following (please initial): _________ ATS are NOT allowed to perform skills in which you have not been instructed (Instruction can be in the class room or in the clinical setting). _________ Clinical education hours must be recorded on the Athletic Training Hours form as verification for meeting class requirements (including the documentation of the day, month, year, and the type of athletic training experience). You must obtain the signature of your preceptor at the end of each day and each week (monthly log due at each monthly meeting). _________ ATS are NOT allowed to travel with a team without direct supervision by preceptor (this policy in effective for all clinical education sites and even includes local travel). _________ All athletic training clinical education hours must be obtained under the DIRECT SUPERVISION of a preceptor. _________ Clinical education hours may be counted for the following: Patient interactions Preparation of patients for practices/competitions Treatments before and after practices/competitions AT duties during practices/competition Injury evaluation/Clinic with a team physician Rehabilitation Observation of a surgery In-services Administrative duties Escorting an patient to an appointment with a physician or to the emergency room _________ Clinical education hours may NOT be counted for the following: Traveling time with a team (on a plane, bus, etc.) Team meetings or Team meals Social Time _________ Students must complete a minimum of 10 hours per week and not exceed a maximum of 40 hours a week. (Exceptions will be made for illnesses, when classes are not in session and for other special circumstances approved by the PD or CEC) I, ____________________________________________, have read and understand the Athletic Training Program Clinical Education Guidelines. ____________________________________________ _________________ 37 Signature Date CLINICAL EDUCATION ROTATION ATTENDANCE POLICY Clinical education is a part of your academic responsibility. Students are required to attend all clinical experiences per the specific site's schedule. Therefore, students are excepted to attend clinical assignments according to their schedule organized between preceptor and student during their initial conference. Students are to adhere to their team's practice, treatment, and competition schedule (if applicable). In the case of the high school hospital or clinic, you are to be in attendance when the facility is open, and your preceptor is working and with patients. Students should communicate regularly with their preceptor to determine potential conflicts and should plan ahead if needing to miss clinical obligations. Failure to do so could result in a change to your associated course (s) grade. Any work schedules or extracurricular activities you need to attend should be scheduled around your clinical education responsibilities. Students must complete a minimum of 10* and no more than 40 clinical education hours each week. Also, students are responsible for meeting the minimum clinical hours required for each of their clinical education classes for the semester. Exceptions to this policy are as follows: UM Classes Day(s) off (At least once a week) A Day off scheduled through a absence request form or Student has met the maximum of 40 hours per week A student is sick as defined by the Active & Communicable Disease Policy or with any other injury or illness with documentation from a physician Any University approved absence (see clinical education syllabus or University Bulletin) *The minimum 10 hours a week rule, is to ensure clinical education is spread out over the semester and not an option for students to decide to only compete 10 hours. Again, the exact number of hours per week will be determined by the nature of the clinical experience as determined by the preceptor and must be within the 10-40 hours min/max policy. Personal Absence Request: Proper approval must be obtained by submitting the Clinical Education Absence Request Form (refer to the Appendix of your Guidelines Manual). Students must get permission from his/her preceptor, and/ or the Clinical Coordinator or PD a minimum of 2 weeks before the requested personal day. Any exception to this rule must be approved and documented by the CEC or the PD. 38 ABSENCE REQUEST GUIDELINES If an ATS is going to be absent, it is his/her responsibility to inform the preceptor two weeks prior to the expected absence. Athletic Training Students must submit an Absence Request Form (refer to Appendix) to the preceptor. In cases of emergency, the ATS must attempt to contact the preceptor as soon as possible. PUNCTUALITY GUIDELINES Punctuality is very important when reporting to the assigned preceptor as scheduled. The Athletic Training Student must notify his/her preceptor in a timely manner if he/she will be arriving late. Preceptors may request that a student be removed from a clinical site for repeated violations of the above policies. 39 ATHLETIC PARTICIPATION GUIDELINES Athletic Training Students are not prohibited from participating in athletics; however, they are advised that athletic participation may prolong their education process. The courses in the Athletic Training major are designed to be taken in sequence to maximize student learning. The education process may be prolonged due to the possible difficulty in fulfilling classroom requirements and in obtaining clinical education experience while in season. STUDYING ABROAD/EXTENDED ABSENCE GUIDELINES Studying abroad is a very good experience and the University encourages it. Thus, Athletic Training Students are not prohibited from studying abroad, nor will students be expelled from the program due to extenuating circumstances resulting in a prolonged absence. However, students will be advised that these situations might prolong their education process. The courses in the Athletic Training major are designed to be taken in sequence to maximize student learning. The student must complete the major in sequence, therefore, upon returning to the program the student must re-enter in the proper sequence. The education process may be prolonged for one to two additional years. Athletic Training Students are advised that there are very limited clinical education experiences at the University of Miami during the summer sessions; therefore, clinical education experience are usually only available during the fall and spring semesters. The Athletic Training Program is currently exploring specific Athletic Training study abroad options and opportunities for the future. 40 UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI STUDENT EMPLOYMENT GUIDELINES Athletic Training Students are not allowed to receive any monetary remuneration during their Athletic Training education experience, excluding scholarships. Federal Work Study Program Through the Federal Work Study Program, the University offers on-campus jobs to undergraduate students demonstrating financial need. A student's work schedule may not, under the regulations, conflict with the class schedule. The basic rate of pay is the prevailing Federal minimum wage, with high higher rate paid for varying skill levels. Student Employment Guidelines Athletic Training Students are eligible for work-study through the University of Miami; however, they are not permitted to receive work-study in the Athletic Training Department or with the Athletic Training Program. These are the guidelines of the Athletic Training Program since students are not permitted to receive payment while being educated in the clinical setting. Furthermore, students that may have an off campus clinical assignment and will not be able to receive work-study or additional employment at that clinical facility. Off-campus Student Employment Students seeking assistance in obtaining off-campus employment should contact the Office of Career Planning and Placement for an off-campus referral. Again, Athletic Training Students are not allowed to receive any monetary remuneration during this education experience, excluding scholarships. 41 CLINICAL EDUCATION EVALUATIONS Copies of these evaluations can be found in the Appendix. However, as of Fall 2016, many of these evaluations will be completed electronically. Goal Sheets (currently offered electronically) Within the first few weeks of the clinical education rotation, the Athletic Training Student (ATS) and the Preceptor must discuss the student's goals for clinical education rotation/ semester. This should assist the preceptor in creating an optimal learning experience and concentrating on the areas that would best benefit the student. Self-Evaluations (currently offered electronically) The ATS will perform a self-evaluation after the first month of the Clinical rotation. The purpose of this evaluation is to give a student a chance to evaluate their own clinical performance and asses their areas in need of improvement. The ATS will complete this form and go over it with their assigned preceptor. Mid-term and Final Formal Evaluations (currently offered electronically and by paper) Preceptors will provide regular informal feedback to students regarding their performance. Formal evaluation of student performance will occur two times during each semester. The first formal evaluation that the preceptor completes on the student is approximately mid-way through the Clinical Athletic Training Rotation. The purpose of this evaluation is to appraise both the ATS's progress and areas in need of improvement. The second is a summative evaluation of the ATS's performance completed by the preceptor at the end of the Clinical Education Rotation. These evaluations will be considered in conjunction with the clinical proficiency evaluations while determining the ATS's grade for the Clinical Athletic Training Lab. Juniors: Clinical Proficiency Forms (Program Requirement) Seniors: Clinical Integrative Proficiencies (Matrix Requirement) Junior Athletic Training students in KIN 251, 261, 443, 444, and 462 are assessed on clinical proficiency scenarios during clinical education rotations and in clinical labs. AT students' progress to Clinical Integrative Proficiency assessments during their senior year. Assuring ATSs mastery of competencies is accomplished through clinical proficiency evaluation forms. The clinical proficiencies are attached to didactic courses that ATSs must complete for the Athletic Training major; therefore, the designated clinical proficiencies must be completed to satisfy the requirements of the didactic course. Each clinical proficiency skill/behavior is graded using a Likert scale ranging from one (0) to five (5). Each score on the Likert scale corresponds to specific skill/behavior that the ATS must demonstrate to obtain that given score. A score of one reflects an inability to complete the proficiency whereas a score of one, two, three, four, or five reflects an ability to complete the proficiency at a poor, fair, good, or superior level, respectively. Successful completion of the skill/behavior includes the proper demonstration with a score of 3 or better from the preceptor. However, students must earn a minimum total score of 26/35 on each clinical proficiency. 42 The clinical proficiency or CIP evaluation forms are provided to the ATSs in the corresponding clinical athletic training laboratory class. The ATS is responsible for maintaining and possessing these clinical proficiency evaluation forms on a daily basis. At the beginning of the clinical rotation, the preceptor and ATS will review and discuss the clinical proficiency evaluation forms to inform the preceptor about the clinical proficiency mastery accomplished by the student. The ATS must be able to present their clinical proficiency evaluations immediately upon request by a preceptor. Preceptor/Clinical Site Evaluation (currently offered electronically) At the conclusion of the clinical experience, the clinical site is evaluated anonymously in conjunction with the evaluation of the preceptor. The ATS submits this evaluation to the CEC for review. At the conclusion of the academic year, the CEC and PD provides the preceptor with general feedback from the evaluation conducted by the ATSs. The CEC or Program Director and the preceptor meet at the conclusion of the academic year to discuss the evaluation and determine the appropriate changes necessary to improve the clinical education experience for the students. Clinical Hour Log and Patient Interaction Form Students track clinical hour forms on a log form found in their Clinical Education Notebook. In addition, students are required to fill out a daily clinical hour log and patient interaction form. Senior Exit Program Evaluations The program also utilized a senior program evaluation, BOC performance data, and teaching evaluations to regularly asses and make clinical education and didactic improvements 43 COMPETENCIES & CLINICAL INTEGRATIVE PROFICIENCIES The Athletic Training Educational Competencies serve as a guide for the development of educational programs and learning experiences leading to a student's eligibility to challenge the BOC examination. Junior level students will complete the required University of Miami AT Program clinical proficiency skills check-offs, while senior level students will complete clinical integrative proficiencies (CIP) that are required by the 5th edition competencies. The Athletic Training Educational Competencies are categorized into eight content areas comprising the knowledge and skill set of entry level athletic trainers: Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Evidence-based practitioners incorporate the best available evidence, their clinical skills, and the needs of the patient to maximize patient outcomes. An understanding of evidence-based practice concepts and their application is essential to sound clinical decision-making and the critical examination of athletic training practice. Prevention and Health Promotion (PHP) Athletic trainers develop and implement strategies and programs to prevent the incidence and/or severity of injuries and illnesses and optimize their clients'/patients' overall health and quality of life. These strategies and programs also incorporate the importance of nutrition and physical activity in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and in preventing chronic disease (eg, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease). Clinical Examination and Diagnosis (CE) Athletic trainers must possess strong clinical examination skills in order to accurately diagnosis and effectively treat their patients. The clinical examination is an on-going process, repeated to some extent each time the patient is treated. The development of these skills requires a thorough understanding of anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics. Athletic trainers must also apply clinical-reasoning skills throughout the physical examination process in order to assimilate data, select the appropriate assessment tests, and formulate a differential diagnosis. Acute Care of Injuries and Illnesses (AC) Athletic trainers are often present when injuries or other acute conditions occur or are the first healthcare professionals to evaluate a patient. For this reason, athletic trainers must be knowledgeable and skilled in the evaluation and immediate management of acute injuries and illnesses. Therapeutic Interventions (TI) Athletic trainers assess the patient's status using clinician- and patient-oriented outcome measures. Based on this assessment and with consideration of the stage of healing and goals, a therapeutic intervention is designed to maximize the patient's participation and health-related quality of life. Psychosocial Strategies and Referral (PS) Athletic trainers must be able to recognize clients/patients exhibiting abnormal social, emotional, and mental behavior. Coupled with recognition is the ability to intervene and refer these individuals as necessary. Additionally, athletic trainers appreciate the role of mental health in injury and recovery and use interventions to optimize the connection between mental health and restoration of participation. 44 Healthcare Administration (HA) Athletic trainers function within the context of a complex healthcare system. Integral to this function is an understanding of risk management, healthcare delivery mechanisms, insurance, reimbursement, documentation, patient privacy, and facility management. Professional Development and Responsibility (PD) The provision of high quality patient care requires that the athletic trainer maintain current competence in the constantly changing world of healthcare. Athletic trainers must also embrace the need to practice within the limits of state and national regulation using moral and ethical judgment. As members of a broader healthcare community, athletic trainers work collaboratively with other healthcare providers and refer clients/patients when such referral is warranted. Clinical Integration Proficiencies (CIP) The clinical integration proficiencies (CIPs) represent the synthesis and integration of knowledge, skills, and clinical decision-making into actual client/patient care. The CIPs have been reorganized into this section (rather than at the end of each content area) to reflect their global nature. For example, therapeutic interventions do not occur in isolation from physical assessment. A simple \"check off list\" can be used to determine psychomotor and cognitive competency, but cannot assess decision making abilities. Clinical Proficiencies and CIP Requirements All Clinical Proficiencies and CIP must be completed with a score of 3 or better on each evaluation component (where applicable). Must have a minimum total score of 26/35 on CIP. Must be accompanied by other required documentation where applicable (i.e. injury reports, personal health profile.) Must be signed by both the student and preceptor 45 CLINICAL INTEGRATIVE PROFICIENCIES REQUIRED BY CLASS **See appendix or clinical education notebooks for evaluation forms by class.

The physical exam is required by the completion of the KIN 140/141 class. These are used in part to demonstrate that the student is able to meet the technical standards adopted by the AT Program. All registered students must meet the University's immunization requirements. In addition, it is suggested that all students receive a Hepatitis B vaccine. The physical examinations are submitted to the Program Director. The immunization records are maintained by the Student Health Center. The Technical Standards form containing the signature of the ATS documenting acknowledgement of this requirement is maintained by the Program Director of the AT Program. Students resign this form annually. Flu Shots and TB Testing as required for all hospital clinical education hours and surgery observations. Please see CEC regarding dates for flu-season vaccinations. This paper work is submitted to the requiring clinical sites. All records are kept confidential and will not be released without the student's permission or court order. 48 HEALTHCARE INSURANCE GUIDELINES Athletic Training Students will be subject to the same health care standards and policies as every other University of Miami Student. Please refer to the Undergraduate Catalog. 49 IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS & VACCINATION INFORMATION All new students are required to provide proof of immunization against measles, mumps and rubella, and tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. All new students must also provide proof of immunization against hepatitis B and meningococcal meningitis or sign a waiver declining these immunizations. An immunization form must be completed and immunization information must be entered at mystudenthealth.miami.edu, and the completed immunization form must be uploaded to mystudenthealth.miami.edu prior to arrival on campus. For students, less than 18 years old, the meningitis/ hepatitis vaccine waivers must be signed by a parent or legal guardian. Students should also consider immunization against varicella (chicken pox). All international students must also be screened for risk of tuberculosis by completing page two of the immunization form, and all nursing, physical therapy and medical (M.D) students are required to obtain additional immunizations and tuberculosis screening as described on the nursing and physical therapy immunization form and medical student immunization form. . Health Sciences students are now able to complete their annual symptom reviews (PPD questionnaires) at mystudenthealth. Sign onto mystudenthealth.miami.edu Click on 'forms and resources' on the left-hand column Then click 'Annual PPD questionnaire'. Answer the question and click 'submit'. Immunization information must be entered at mystudenthealth.miami.edu prior to uploading to allow for verification. Flu Shots and TB Testing as required for all hospital clinical education hours and surgery observations. Please see CEC regarding dates for flu-season vaccinations. Immunization information is provided to the State of Florida FLORIDA SHOTS immunization registry. Students can opt-out of the immunization registry by contacting us at studenthealth@miami.edu . This is an opt-out of sharing immunization information with the State of Florida registry and NOT an opt out of the immunization requirement. Deadlines for submission of immunization records are Fall-August 22nd, Spring-January 15th and Summer-April 15th for all except medical students. Medical student deadlines are as stated on the medical student immunization form. Failure to comply with these immunization requirements prior to the beginning of your first semester will interfere with registration and a $50.00 late processing fee will be charged for any form received after the start of the semester. Forms will be processed within 48 hours of receipt, and immunization status can be verified via mystudenthealth.miami.edu. Most students will be able to obtain the required immunization information from their prior medical providers or from their prior high school, college or university. Students who believe that they were 50 previously immunized but are unable to provide proof of immunization may either obtain blood tests confirming immunity or obtain the necessary immunizations. Immunizations and blood tests documenting immunity are available at the Student Health Service. All charges are in addition to processing fees for late forms. All students living on campus will also be asked to document receipt of hepatitis and meningococcal meningitis immunizations, or to acknowledge both receipt of information about these vaccines and preference against immunization. This can be done during completion of the immunization form or via mystudenthealth.miami.edu. VACCINATION INFORMATION Tuberculosis Screening Tuberculosis screening must be completed by all international students, and requires completion of page two of the Immunization Form. International students who have not had contact with others sick with tuberculosis, who were born in a country considered low risk for tuberculosis, and have never lived in or traveled to any country other than USA considered low risk for tuberculosis do not require additional screening. All other international students must have additional screening with a PPD Test within six months prior to arrival on campus, or by one month after arrival on campus. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is a serious infectious disease that attacks the liver and can lead to lifelong infection and even death. The virus is spread when an individual comes in contact with blood or other body fluids of an infected person through broken skin or mucous membranes. Each year approximately 3,000 - 5,000 people die from hepatitis B. Although there is no cure, the infection can be prevented by vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccination of everyone 18 years of age and under, as well as others at high risk for hepatitis B, including anyone with more than one lifetime sexual partner. Unprotected sex, non-sterile body piercing and tattoos, sharing needles, toothbrushes, razors and pierced earrings, and travel abroad to countries where hepatitis B is common, can increase the risk for college students. In addition, health sciences students (e.g., nursing and medical students) are at particular risk of exposure through patient care. The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective but should not be given to anyone who has had a life threatening reaction to baker's yeast or to a previous dose of the vaccine. The most common side effect of the vaccine is soreness at the site of the injection. Vaccination requires a series of three shots over a six month period and provides long term immunity. In addition to vaccination, people can attempt to reduce their risk by using condoms during sex and avoiding tattooing and body piercing with non-sterile instruments or techniques. They should also avoid sharing needles, pierced earrings, razors or toothbrushes. 51 Meningitis (Meningococcal Disease) Meningococcal disease is a rare but potentially fatal bacterial disease that occurs either as meningococcal meningitis, inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord or meningococcemia, presence of bacteria in the blood. Meningococcal disease occurs in about 1-3 out of 100,000 people each year, but is more common among freshman students living in on-campus housing. About 10-15% of those affected die in spite of antibiotic treatment and of those who survive, another 10-20% lose limbs, become deaf, have neurological problems, become mentally disabled or suffer seizures or strokes. Meningococcal bacteria are transmitted through the air via droplets of respiratory secretions, and through direct contact with persons infected with the disease. Oral contact with shared items such as cigarettes or drinking glasses or through intimate contact such as kissing, could put a person at risk for acquiring the infection. People identified as close contacts of a patient with meningococcal disease should receive antibiotics to prevent the disease. Symptoms include high fever, severe headaches, neck stiffness, rash, nausea, vomiting and lethargy (confusion, sleepiness, being hard to wake up). Because the disease progresses rapidly, often in as little as 12 hours, those who experience two or more of the above symptoms are urged to seek immediate medical care. The vaccine is considered to be safe, but should not be given to those who have had a serious allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components. Anyone with a history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome should speak to their health care provider before getting the conjugate (Menactra) vaccine. Some people have mild side effects including redness or pain at the injection site or fever. The vaccine does not completely eliminate the possibility of infection, but is effective against the strains responsible for two thirds of the cases on college campuses. Meningococcal Meningitis and Hepatitis B immunizations are available at the University of Miami Student Health Service. Varicella (Chickenpox) Chickenpox is more than just a childhood disease. While the symptoms are usually mild in children, college students may be 10 times more likely than children to develop serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death. Each year, approximately 11,000 people are hospitalized and 100 die due to chickenpox. Chickenpox may spread more easily in a college living environment, and college students are considered to be more susceptible to the disease. As with hepatitis B, health sciences students are at particular risk of exposure to chickenpox through patient care and furthermore may transmit the infection to patients at high risk of complications. A vaccine is available to prevent chickenpox, and the CDC and ACHA recommend all college students who have not had chickenpox be vaccinated against the disease. If your child has not had chickenpox, it is strongly recommended by health officials that he or she get vaccinated. Varicella (Chicken Pox) vaccines are available at the University of Miami Student Health Service. 52 More information is available at www.miami.edu/student-health. Pertussis Pertussis is a bacterial respiratory illness characterized by severe spasms of coughing that can last for several weeks or even for months. According to the CDC, in the United States, 5000-7000 cases of pertussis are reported each year. There has been an overall increase in cases since 1990, with a disproportionate increase in adolescents and adults. Pertussis is highly contagious with up to 90% of susceptible household contacts developing clinical disease following exposure to an index case. Adolescents and adults who have been vaccinated as children often have mild or no symptoms, but may have classic pertussis. Infected individuals can pass the disease to non-immunized or not completely immunized infants, and the disease can be severe in these individuals. Due to the increased prevalence of pertussis, recent guidelines have recommended that tetanus boosters, which previously included diphtheria, should include pertussis as well. This combined vaccine (Tdap) should be given to adolescents. The Tdap vaccine can be given regardless of interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria-toxoid containing vaccine. HPV Vaccine The Human Papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for girls 11-12 years old, and for girls and women 13-26 years old and is also available for boys and men up to age 26 . The vaccine targets HPV subtypes that cause 70% of all cervical cancers and about 90% of genital warts, and is given in a series of three doses in a 6 month period. The vaccine is currently available at the Student Health Service. More information is available from the CDC. Vaccination Costs The cost of the physical examination and vaccinations are the student's responsibility. Hepatitis B Vaccines can be obtained at the Student Health Center 53 UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI HEALTHCARE GUIDELINES The Student Health Center is a modern, on-campus, outpatient medical center.

The preceptor should show the student where the EAP is located at the Clinical Site e. Students may submit a copy of the EAP or complete other assignments to their Clinical Lab Instructor as proof that the EAP was given to the students 56 CPR & AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATION TRAINING The Athletic Training Staff and the Athletic Training Students will receive annual Automatic External Defibrillation (AED) training program conducted by the Athletic Training Staff member or local EMS. The AED training program consists of a thorough explanation of how to work the AED, and a hypothetical situation in which the AED is used to treat a patient. The following points are addressed during the training session: The proper use, maintenance, and periodic inspection of the AED. Defibrillator safety precaution to enable the user to administer a shock without jeopardizing the safety of the patient, the user, or other persons. Assessment of an unconscious person to determine if cardiac arrest has occurred and the appropriateness of applying an AED. Recognizing that an electrical shock has been delivered to the patient and that the defibrillator is no longer charged. Rapid, accurate assessment of the patient's post-shock status to determine if further activation of the AED is necessary. The operations for the local emergency medical services system, including methods of access to the emergency response system, and interaction with emergency medical services personnel. The role of the user and coordination with other emergency medical service providers in the provision of CPR, defibrillation, basic life support, and advanced life support. The responsibility of the user to continue care until the arrival of medically qualified personnel. 57 BLOOD BORNE PATHOGEN TRAINING The Athletic Training Staff and the Athletic Training Students are required to attend the annual OSHA Blood Borne Pathogen training program conducted by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety or a designated representative.

Rulemaking Authority 468.705 FS. Law Implemented 64B30-25.004, Amended link for the latest edition: https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ChapterHome.asp?Chapter=64B33-4 63 NATA Code of Ethics Preamble The National Athletic Trainers' Association Code of Ethics states the principles of ethical behavior that should be followed in the practice of athletic training. It is intended to establish and maintain high standards and professionalism for the athletic training profession. The principles do not cover every situation encountered by the practicing athletic trainer, but are representative of the spirit with which athletic trainers should make decisions. The principles are written generally; the circumstances of a situation will determine the interpretation and application of a given principle and of the Code as a whole. When a conflict exists between the Code and the law, the law prevails. 1.

September 2005, Revised 2018 65 CLASSROOM DECORUM The University seeks to promote a teaching and learning environment free from material and substantial classroom disruptions. Faculty and students have a joint responsibility to develop and maintain an optimal learning environment. Faculty members and teaching staff have the authority and responsibility to effectively manage their classroom environments. Instructors may determine the time and manner for student questions and expression of points of view in the instructional setting.

The University of Miami School of Education and Human Development, Department of Kinesiology & Sports Sciences, awards a Bachelor's of Science Athletic Training degree to students who successfully complete the curriculum. Students are expected to acquire a broad base of knowledge and skills, and competencies of an entry-level Athletic Trainer as well as meet the expectations of the program's accrediting agency, The Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). Bachelor's of Science Athletic Training degree will be required to acquire the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. In order to learn the variety of tasks needed to become proficient as an Athletic Trainer, the student must be able to perform the following tasks, which are all essential requirements of the program: observation, communication, motor, conceptual (integrative and quantitative), and behavioral/social. Observation The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in basic and applied sciences, including, but not limited to human anatomy and physiology, neuroscience, as well as in didactic courses in Athletic Training theory and practice for normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation requires the use of common sense, as well as the functional use of the senses of vision, audition, olfaction, and palpation. Communication A candidate must be able to elicit information from patients, describe the patient's mood, activity and posture, and perceive and accurately report nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with coaches, administrators, patients and their families. Communication includes not only oral, but also reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently with all members of the health care team in both immediate and recorded modes. Motor Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, manual positioning of body segments and other evaluative procedures. A candidate must be able to do basic screening and examinations (physiological measures such as BP, HR and respiration), diagnostic procedures (palpation, manual muscle testing, goniometry, ligament laxity testing, sensory evaluation, gait analysis, balance assessment), and review X-rays. A candidate must be able to lift an adequate amount of weight (approximately 50 pounds) in order to assess and lift a patient as necessary. A candidate must be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of Athletic Training students are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, spine stabilization for head or neck injury and application of pressure to stop bleeding. Additionally, candidates must be able to perform debridement 81 of wounds and other physical assessment maneuvers, where such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Conceptual-Integrative and Quantitative Analysis These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, synthesis, and retention of complex information. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of Athletic Training practitioners, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral/Social Attitudes Candidates must possess the emotional health required for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to an evaluation, diagnosis and care of patients, and be able to develop mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically-taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments both indoor and outdoor, display flexibility and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and education process. Completion of the program's technical standards does not guarantee a student's eligibility for the Board of Certification (BOC) exam. Students requesting accommodation to meet the technical standards must contact the Office of Disability Services prior to the start of the program or immediately upon a change in health status. I certify that I have read and understand the technical standards listed above that are required of students selected to participate in the Athletic Training Educational Program and understand that they are essential requirements of the program.
