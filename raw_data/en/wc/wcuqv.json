The cli - mate question is linked to our thinking and to our actions. The one-sided pursuit of personal interests and egocentric needs damages the cli - mate on earth. It is similar with the climate between us hu - man beings: our natural needs can easily lead to isolation and separation, while spiritual con - siderations unite and integrate. Rudolf Steiner therefore speaks of the true human I as the \u00abunifying I\u00bb. The theme of the Christmas Conference in 2019 at the Goetheanum relates to these questions: How do we build communities? How do we keep in contact? And how can brotherliness arise as a ground on which anthroposophy can grow? These questions touch on the \u00abWe\u00bb and point to the fourth verse of the Foundation Stone Meditation. Remembering our spiritual foundations Human community-building has a more or less conscious past from which essential forces and impulses can arise for our work. It makes sense, therefore, to remember these spiritual goals or, in other words, to \u00abpractise Spirit Recalling\u00bb. Communities and collaboration are effective in the present and they need us to reflect on their spiritual foundations. However, a community is also future-oriented: together we look ahead to the ideals and objectives it stands for. Goals one works towards are always future- oriented since otherwise they would already have been achieved and maybe even belong to the past. In the spiritual goals and the working of communities lives a \u00abbecoming\u00bb and a plea: \u00abthat good may become\u00bb. This is about follow - ing the good star of which Rudolf Steiner spoke at the Christmas Conference of 1923/1924. The spiritual substance of the community points beyond individuals and their angel to the com - munal spiritual activities of the archangels and the impulses of the spirits of time. The fourth verse of the Foundation Stone Mediation speaks of the underlying Sun forces that will unfold when two or three are gathered \u00abin his name\u00bb. Living and working together We warmly invite you to this year's Christmas Conference and to work with us on the mysteries of community. Questions of working together are more acute than ever. As the anthroposophical movement and Society we need to practise com - munity-building in order to develop cultural im - pulses that can bring health to the earth and en - hance human coexistence and cooperation. We are looking forward to working together on this in the spirit of Christmas! | Matthias Girke, Goetheanum Editorial November 2019 N\u00b011 Pause for thought 2 Social commitment Anthroposophical Society 1 Developing cultural impulses 2 Rudolf Steiner: Community-building 3 Australia: Stepping down 3 Peru: Harmony of the Spheres 3 France: At the threshold 4 Events: Goethe's Faust Parts 1 & 2 4 Georgia: Youth conference 2020 11 Membership News School of Spiritual Science 4 Visual Arts Section: How did the appointment come about? 5 Natural Science Section: New Section leaders 5 Goetheanum Meditation Initiative Worldwide: Meeting the Guardian of the Threshold 6 Visual Arts Section: Paintings from Georgia 6 Education Section: Knowledge of the human being 6 Medical Section: Training for physicians 7 Medical Section: Eurythmy therapy Goetheanum 7 Campus: Video room 7 Stage: Faust discussion evening Anthroposophy worldwide 8 Russia: Spiritual ecology 8 Turkey: Songs, eurythmy ... 8 and Euchore Ensemble 9 Germany: Ch.

For the same reason it is also essential that our society gets occasionally shaken up by the young generation - and many young people do precisely that. They dem - onstrate, hold alternative views, think much about and discuss their country's future. Young people are very much committed to political processes. Recently, a confrontation took place between young activists (mainly students) and the police, triggered by the thoughtless behaviour of the government that violated the dignity of the citizens. After that, thousands of young people went on the streets, showing us that they are striving for a meaningful future for their country. Unfortunately, youth education and employ - ment remain a problem, which means that many young people go abroad. But they are at least aware that they have to bring about changes and find ways if they want to have a better future. Interest in anthroposophy Anthroposophy is not new in Georgia. It has been known here since the 1910s and has devel - oped into a strong movement since then. Aside from various anthroposophical institutions, the country has an active Anthroposophical Society whose work is mainly concentrated in the capital, Tbilisi. It organizes many events throughout the year. Here too, a group of young people is actively involved. Its members have been meeting every Wednesday over the past six years, working on various texts by Rudolf Steiner under the guidance of the council mem - bers: first they study the texts and have a con - versation and then they do artistic work: either Goethean picture observation or eurythmy. In the summer of 2016 the youth group was invited to come to the Goetheanum for the Faust Youth Conference. There, the young Georgians got to know many people and par - ticipated in various work groups and activities. In the summer of 2018, the group was again invited to the Goetheanum's Youth Conference. This time they brought a play (Faust) with them which they performed under the direction of Valerian Gorgoschidze. It was then that the idea came up to hold the next international Youth Section meeting in Georgia (page 3).A strong core group In the autumn of 2018 the group began to look out for other young people who are interested in a project on social questions. As a result, a second group was formed whose members are prepared to take responsibility for a confer - ence. In order to form a strong core group the young people decided to work regularly (every weekend, or every second weekend) on anthro - posophical contents and to invite members of the Anthroposophical Society in Georgia who have been studying anthroposophy for a long time to share their experiences with them. Georgia clearly has strong youth impulses that are active in various directions: many young people are socially active and interested in social processes. | Sandro Benedikt Belkania, Tbilisi Lenzburg ( ch) in 1996.

[...] We sense something that goes beyond lan - guage, when we meet someone in later life whom we knew as children. [...] What do we experi- ence when we attend cultic rituals together? [...] We experience shared memories of pre-earthly existence. [...] The cultic community seeks to invite the heavenly angels to descend to the cultic space and be among human beings. The anthro- posophical community seeks to elevate human hearts to the super - sensible world so that they can be among angels. [...] The work of an anthroposophical group does not consist in people talking about an - throposophical ideas, but in people feeling so united as human beings that they are awakened by each other and lifted up to the spiritual world in order to truly dwell among spiritual beings. [...] and that gives them strength [...].

Rather than merely registering decisions and trying their luck abroad, young Georgians stand up for better life conditions in their own country.

Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 11/19 | 3 Antroposophical Society Australia Stepping down Jan Baker-Finch will end her time as General Secretary for Australia at the Australian An - throposophical Society's agm in May 2020. General Secretaries are appointed through an election process in Australia, and the time in office is limited to two three-year terms. I took on the role jointly with my colleague, friend and mentor Peter Glasby in 2011. We worked together until Peter's death at the end of 2013. In May 2020, I will have completed two further terms, so the time has come for me to step down. I have truly appreciated the opportunity to meet many people whose inspiring work both locally and internationally has given me the courage and enthusiasm needed to continue striving to build an effective and interconnected community of anthroposophical initiatives in Australia, that are actually contributing towards the health of the whole community. Working as a part-time volunteer General Secretary has limitations and in order to in - crease the reach and vitality of the Society's activities a shift towards a form of shared lead - ership is, in my view, now necessary. Facilitator Herbert Wolpert is leading a series of work - shops with Society representatives aimed at bringing about such a change in the best and most widely embraced way. Late in 2018 I co-founded Pacifica College of Eurythmy near Brisbane. I am already very much occupied with establishing it as part of what we envisage will one day be a sustain - able, versatile, well-funded and well-resourced hub of art and social endeavours. Retirement does not feature anywhere in my future plans! | Jan Baker-Finch, general secretary of the Anthroposophical Society in AustraliaPeru Harmony of the spheres On 4 September, celebrating 400 years of Johannes Kepler's The Harmony of the World, Hartmut Warm spoke in Peru about the har - mony of the spheres. Given the limited interest people generally have in cosmic events, it was courageous to organize a public talk on the harmony of the spheres in South America. And yet, more than fifty people came and they were truly astounded. While we have direct access today to all the media and seem to have forgotten how to wonder at the incredibility of the cosmic intelligence, the Mi - chaelic age of spiritual enlightenment requires us to be astounded because without that we cannot really become researchers in the spiritual world. In his work Harmonices Mundi Johannes Ke - pler presented a basic cosmic order but was unable, with the means of his time, to provide sufficient evidence for it. Only now - much, much later - Hartmut Warm has been able to corroborate the validity of Johannes Kepler's de - liberations with sophisticated programmes and technologies. Rudolf Steiner made various indi - cations but was unable to go into detail. Hartmut Warren spoke of the silicon crystal, for instance, as a structure that the movements of certain planets correspond to. This is an important ob - servation because, in the Agriculture Course (ga 327), Rudolf Steiner spoke of Quartz and how it represented the cosmic order in farming. Such research results can be applied in many fields, in medicine for instance, given that the cosmic order is reflected in everything: the mac - rocosm is a mirror image of the microcosm. Our endeavours as anthroposophists are, and should always be, interdisciplinary; only then can we claim to do true spiritual research. | Thomas Spittler, Lima ( pe)France At the threshold On 28 and 29 September the annual meeting of the Anthroposophical Society of southeast France was held in the Hautes-Alpes region. In the last eleven years members of the Anthro - posophical Society in southeast France have met annually in various places, which means they get to know these regions better and learn about their culture and history. These meetings, which alternate between one day and two days, usually attract around 80 people - members, friends and guests. This year, the meeting was held north of Gap in the Hautes-Alpes region, and was attended by people of all generations. The theme was \u00abApproaching the Threshold\u00bb. Courage and internalization The preparation group, which consists of seven members, took a somewhat daring step last year by reducing the formal contributions to a mini - mum and encouraging everyone to get involved. This year we were able to benefit mutually from our spontaneous offerings. A climate of truth - fulness, the modesty of those who spoke and the sympathetic listening of the others made it possible for everyone to experience the special atmosphere of the threshold: an experience that is more important than talking \u00ababout\u00bb a topic. There was also a plenum on the School of Spiritual Science that created space for ques - tions. The open exchange helped to overcome the sometimes mystifying atmosphere and cer - tain preconceptions surrounding the First Class. Many attendees who had kept a distance from the School of Spiritual Science in the past were personally touched and recognized their own questions in the School's aims. Thanks to the incredibly mild pre-autumn mood in nature, these powerful experiences were coupled with an experience of beauty. We were able to hear the invitation to be courageous and to internalize the light - virtues that are associated with the image of Michael. | Alain Tessier, Marseille ( fr) Sebastian J\u00fcngelContact pronino@hidrostal.com.pe Image Venus-Earth-Venus: rotation in around 240 years , Hartmut Warm Read and order Anthroposophy Worldwide www.anthroposo - phie.org/en 4 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 11/19 Antroposophical Society School of Spiritual Science Performance and conferences Goethe's Faust Parts 1 and 2 In 2020 the Goetheanum Stage will present Faust Parts 1 and 2 by Johann Wolfgang Goethe in a new produc- tion directed by Andrea Pfaehler and Eduardo Torres. Goethe's Faust Parts 1 and 2 will be per - formed again at the Goetheanum in the summer of 2020. Since its premiere in 1938 - and this is unique in the world - the Goetheanum has been regularly showing unabridged performances of both parts of the tragedy. The forthcoming new produc- tion will constitute a new approach. With the help of Georg Darvas, the Faust team around Andrea ardo Torres and Nils Frischknecht (Goethea - num Stage) has worked out a shortened version that can be performed in around nine hours. The overall impression will be retained, allowing the audience to have an overview and follow the plot as it unfolds. The new production of Faust Parts 1 and 2 will premiere on 20 and 21 June 2020. Further performances will be integrated into special Faust Weekends under the motto of \u00abFaust+\u00bb. The various Sections at the Goetheanum will select topical ques - tions and deepen them against the back - ground of the Faust story. For, as ever, the special character of Faust at the Goethea - num lies in an approach to the question of \u00abbecoming human\u00bb and to the tasks of humanity that is inspired by spiritual science and relates to the present time. In June, there will be a special Faust pro- gramme for school classes (www.goethe - anum-paedagogik.ch/veranstaltungen/ faust-schueler-tagung). | Sebastian J\u00fcngel 20 - 21 June 2020 Performance of Goethe's Faust Parts 1 and 2 (premiere) (German) 3 - 5 July 2020 From Gretchen to Greta: How is it with you and climate change?

Every summer young people from different countries come together at the Goetheanum. They share their experiences, speak about their plans and establish contacts. In 2020 this meet - ing will for the first time not take place at the Goetheanum but at the initiative of young peo - ple from Georgia in their own country. Taking such a step can make us feel empowered and more self-confident; it will also set an example for young people all over the world to organize such a conference in their country too. Again and again we have worked on organi - zational questions such as: Where should the conference be? What should it be about? How do we deal with technical issues? We visited many places around our country that might be suitable for the conference and now we have found one. We had many discussions about the content and have now decided that it will be about the fourth seven-year period in the human biogra - phy, because then we can do it in a meaningful way - this will be helpful for the young people. The threefold social organism will be another topic because the young people are about to embark on an independent life, and it will help them to get clarity about the situation in the world and the possibilities of social threefolding. We have been in contact with the Youth Sec - tion at the Goetheanum and the Council of the Anthroposophical Society in Georgia. The orga - nizational group consists of young people from Georgia, Switzerland, Romania, Latvia and Russia. Following the preparatory phase we have now entered the creative phase. | Sandro Benedikt Belkania, Tbilisi ( ge)Visual Arts How did the appointment come about? Additional information to the news of Chris- tiane Haid's appointment as head of Visual Arts in Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2019. In Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2019 the spokespersons for the Goetheanum Leader - ship announced the appointment of Christiane Haid as the future head, for a limited period from 2020 until the end of 2022, of the School of Spiritual Science's Visual Arts Section. This de - cision was preceded by consultations conducted from January 2019 onward by a search group consisting of Willi Grass, Stefan Hasler, Claudia Schl\u00fcrmann and Dino Wendtland (Christiane Haid was initially also a member of this group). The search group was given the task to propose to the Goetheanum Leadership ( gl) a successor for Marianne Schubert before her withdrawal as head of Visual Arts in January 2020. Following conversations, some of them quite extensive, with 30 individuals, the search group had not been able to come up with a recommendation by the summer of 2019. At their retreat in September the Goetheanum Leadership decided - as reported - to confer the leadership of the Visual Art Section for a limited period of three years to Christiane Haid, who is also head of Humanities. Christiane Haid is now in the process of forming a specialist team with representatives from the different art disciplines. So far, these include Pieter van der Ree und Yaike Dunselman for architecture and Rik ten Cate and Barbara Schnetzler for sculpture. Towards the end of 2022 the Goetheanum Leadership will then make a decision regard - ing the Section leadership. | Marianne Schubert, head of Visual Arts at the Goetheanum Contact youthconference@gmail.com Image Youth meeting: members of the organi- zation team, courtesy of Web sbk.goetheanum.org Image Marianne Schubert, Sebastian J\u00fcngel Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 11/19 | 5 After last year's meeting in The Hague ( nl), the networkers decided in favour of Avignon (fr) for a meeting this year in order to support anthroposophy in France and get to know the situation there better. The Waldorf movement in France keeps being attacked with accusa - tions of sectarianism that have also affected the Anthroposophical Society. The meeting was prepared by Willem Meesters from the Didascali Waldorf Teacher Training and Alain Tessier, who is a council member of the Anthroposophical Society in France, with additional support from Ren\u00e9 Becker, the general secretary of the An - throposophical Society in France. The network initiative is undergoing changes because many of the original initiators have left and new members have joined in the past year. Joan Sleigh represents the Executive Council at the Goetheanum within the initiative and Christiane Haid the Goetheanum Leadership. Guardian and teacher The initiative was founded in order to create a space for sharing and joint research into the various forms of anthroposophic meditation based on the mantras of the nineteen Class Les - sons. After studying the connection between the 19th and the first Class Lessons in 2018, this year's meeting focused on the meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold. Ursula Flatters from J\u00e4rna ( se) gave an outline of how the figure of the Guardian of the Threshold changes in the course of the nineteen Class Lessons. The way he ad - dresses, accompanies and guides the meditant changes noticeably from one lesson to the next. From the beginning, he is not only the Guardian of the Threshold but also the teacher who leads the meditant through the various realms within the spiritual worlds. Wolfgang Tomaschitz, the general secretary of the Anthroposophical Society in Austria, referred to the fourth meditation in Rudolf Steiner's book A Way of Self-Knowledge ( ga 16) in order to il -lustrate how precarious the situation is at the threshold when meditants realize that they have to remelt their entire earthly existence in order to be able to enter the reality of the spiritual world. They need to achieve the ability to live with two contrary attitudes in both the sensory and the supersensible worlds. In small groups, we shared our experiences of the threshold situation and the various forms in which the Guardian of the Threshold appears. The whole experience was further enriched by a reading from and exercises based on passages from Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas in rela - tion to Johannes Thomasius and others meeting the Guardian of the Threshold. Andreas Neider spoke about the significance of humanity's un - conscious crossing of the threshold. Enlivening, heart-warming forces The landscape around the Avignon Waldorf School, through which the Sorgue river flows, has a special warmth and quality of light. This landscape, the warm welcome extended by our French friends, but also the strong Mistral wind conveyed something of the enlivening and heart- warming forces of the Southern French Vaucluse to our meeting. The network initiative will meet on the week - end after Easter 2020 (on invitation) in order to look ahead to a further major public Living Con - nections conference in 2021, which will be about meditative experience in relation to self-knowl - edge. | Andreas Neider, Weil im Sch\u00f6nbuch ( de) School of Spiritual Science Natural Science Section New Section leaders Johannes K\u00fchl has been head of the Natural Science Section at the Goetheanum since 1996. At the end of 2019 he will pass on the leadership to a team of two. At the end of this year, Johannes K\u00fchl will re - tire as head of the Natural Science Section, but continue with other tasks at the Goetheanum. He took over as Section leader from Jochen Bockem\u00fchl 23 years ago, which makes him the longest-serving member within the Goethea - num Leadership group. In his time in office he has experienced and carried many activities. The Natural Science Section which is in name and activity the one most dedicated to the sci - ences is also special in that it has its own research institute. Building the bridge between spiritual and natural science has always been seen by Jo - hannes K\u00fchl as his key task. A review will follow. Appointment for an initial period of two years From 1 January onwards Matthias Rang and Jo - hannes Wirz, both co-workers of the Natural Science Section, will be its new leaders. This pro - posal was confirmed by the Goetheanum Leader - ship on 15 October. We are looking forward to our two new colleagues and welcome them warmly. Matthias Rang is a physicist and has worked at the Research Institute since 2007. During that time he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Phenomenology of Complementary Spectra. Johannes Wirz, who has been a co-worker since 1987, is already one of the leaders of the Institute. He is a molecular biologist whose main focus at present is on bees and seeds. This double appointment will initially be for two years by which time Johannes Wirz will have reached retirement age. After that a new Section leadership team will be ap - pointed consisting of Matthias Rang and a suc - cessor for Johannes Wirz. This will make sure that we continuity as well as rejuvenation in the Section. | Ueli Hurter and Justus Wit - tich on behalf of the Goetheanum Leadership Image Johannes K\u00fchl (2000), Sebastian J\u00fcngelWeb www.meditation.goetheanum.org Image from The Soul's Awakening, Rudolf Steiner Goetheanum Meditation Initiative Worldwide Meeting the Guardian of the Threshold Around 40 people attended the network meeting of the Goetheanum Meditation Ini- tiative Worldwide which was held at the Wal- dorf School close to Avignon (fr) from 11 to 13 July 2019. The Initiative, which was founded in 2006, presented this year's meeting in Ger - man and English. The theme was the Guard- ian of the Threshold.6 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 11/19 School of Spiritual Science Visual Arts Paintings from Georgia On 28 September an exhibition opened at the Goetheanum of \u00abContemporary Art from Tbilisi.\u00bb Georgia's ambassador to Switzerland was present. Valerian Gorgoshidse recited, even celebrated, Georgian poetry in the Goetheanum's Founda - tion Stone Auditorium, in a space emerging out of light and colour changes, where the letters of the Georgian alphabet were suspended, into which Lasha Malashkia again and again wove his expressive eurythmy. The entire dramatic and lyrical range of the vocalic Georgian language resonated in the qualities of the sounds, words and rhythms. The planet poems, which were immersed in the corresponding coloured light, could be understood and experienced thanks to the eurythmy gestures. The pictures of the seven artists who were present at the vernissage and of Irakli Parjiani who died in 1991 are exhibited on the first floor of the Goetheanum. Each of the paintings conveys the deeply religious, icon-like, almost mysti - cal and oriental influence of the vibrant, partly imaginative stories they tell. Looking at these pictures, including the few landscapes, the ob - server experiences a rich inner life. A magical, almost oriental world As we enter the exhibition space, we first gaze at a large painting by Anton Balanchivadze, entitled \u00abOn the Eve of Time\u00bb, which has a Chagall-like quality. It seems to transport us to an archaic fairy world where we are surrounded by beings that seem to speak to us. In Irakli Parjiani's paint - ings one senses the artist's world of experience. Using light and darkness, he objectifies the experience in a way that lets observers feel they are part of it. There are also \u00ababstract\u00bb paintings. One, by Mischa Pitkhelauri, is entitled \u00abElements of a Theory of Knowledge of Goethe's Worldview\u00bb. It reflects the relationship that forms between the intuitive observer and the grey sensory world that is separate from him. Keti Matabeli takes us into the magical, almost oriental world of the Georgian national epic The Knight in the Pan - ther's Skin . There are more pictures to discover. To the sensitive observer they will reveal won - derful worlds. | Ronald Templeton, Dornach ( ch)Education Section Knowledge of the human being The Education Section's research week on the anthroposophical image of the human being, which was held at the Goetheanum from 30 September to 4 October, was about creating out of nothing. This year's research week on Rudolf Steiner's image of the human being took its cue from his lecture of 17 June 1909 ( ga 107) in connection with the ninth Class Lesson. Rudolf Steiner asks how the evolution of the world and of humanity interrelate. Using the example of the plant world, he demonstrates that plants develop physically and etherically and then \u00abrepeat themselves\u00bb (inclusion). Humans develop their physical and life bodies until they reach puberty, or what Steiner calls \u00abearth maturity\u00bb. Like humans, animals develop their soul body, but then stop there (evolution), while humans still have the possibility of developing their I. This means they can create new things that did not exist before. Creation from nothing This creating from nothing is something quite concrete. When we see two people together and we rejoice in this, our joy is something entirely new, something that was not there before. Their being together could be karmic, but our joy isn't. It is the Christ impulse that makes it possible for us to continuously create something new in our soul. For this to happen, it is necessary for the con - stituent members of our organization to change. Rudolf Steiner gives us the following image: When we have a car, we need to change a tyre after a while, and then another one. Once we have replaced more and more parts the day will come when nothing is left of the original car. It has become a new car. The members of our organization need to change in the same way by the time we reach the Vulcan era. This research week took place for the first time in the 1990s, supported by Heinz Zimmermann who was then head of the Education Section at the Goetheanum. The members of this research group have worked in the way proposed by Ru - dolf Steiner in the third lecture of Meditatively Acquired Knowledge of the Human Being (in ga 302a, Balance in Teaching ): studying, medi - tating, remembering: then inspirations for the teaching practice would begin to flow. Luckily, Christof Wiechert as well as Florian Osswald and Claus-Peter R\u00f6h continued with this research work. | Marcel de Leuw, Warnsveld ( nl)Medical Section Training for physicians A new training for anthroposophic physicians in the English language will take place at Em - erson College (gb) from 15 February 2020 to 21 May 2022. Many patients and physicians are looking for an integrative medical approach that considers the whole human being, body, soul and spirit. The new training aims at experiential learning processes based not least on the meeting with the patient. The course will include insights into the trea - sure of anthroposophic medicines and the way they are manufactured. Participants can ex - perience the effects of art therapy, eurythmy therapy, body therapy and nursing procedures, all of which can strengthen the therapeutic responses. In addition, they will learn how to include biographical aspects and insights from psychotherapy into the therapeutic process while their ethical and spiritual development will be enhanced by learning about meditative practices. Webinars and mentoring are also in - cluded in the training. The training will consist of nine one-week modules spread over three years that will mostly take place at Emerson College ( gb) but also in the anthroposophic hospitals in Witten/Herdecke (de), Berlin Havelh\u00f6he ( de) and Arlesheim ( ch) as well as at the Goetheanum and the Trigonos Centre in North Wales ( gb). This training is aimed at physicians worldwide, including in European countries that have no independent anthroposophic medical training yet. Successful participation will result in a cer - tificate that entitles qualified physicians to use the title Anthroposophic Physician. | Matthias Girke und Georg Soldner, GoetheanumWeb sbk.goetheanum.org/aus-der-sektion/ videos Goetheanum, Fran\u00e7ois Bonh\u00f4te Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 11/19 | 7 School of Spiritual Science Stage Faust discussion evening On 16 October the new Faust team at the Goetheanum spoke about text cuts, casting, the speech choir and Faust weekends in rela- tion to the new production of 2020. By now, the Faust team has completed its task of reducing the performance time of Goethe's Faust Parts 1 and 2 from seventeen to around nine hours. Some of the forty people who at - tended the Faust discussion spoke the parts in the (abridged) Upper and Lower Peneios scenes in order to get an impression of how the actual text cuts work. Director Andrea Pfaehler de - scribed the dynamic as \u00abmore youthful\u00bb. The new production will portray the various levels of existence in different ways. Mephisto and Helena will, for instance, be portrayed both through eurythmy (in the spiritual world) and acting (in Faust's empirical world), while four different actors will present diverse aspects of Faust's being. This focus on essential character - istics has also had an influence on the text. As Eduardo Torres, who is in charge of eurythmy, pointed out, more text is needed to create the quality of the dreamy sphere in both Peneios scenes than for individual acting scenes. In addi - tion, says Andrea Pfaehler, the beings presented often move in monologic situations. For the new production a group of speech art - ists has formed as well as a speech choir of 36 peo - ple from around the Goetheanum (directed by Agnes Zehnter). Both will speak for the eurythmy. By setting the Euphorion Scene to music, Elmar Lampson has both realized a wish expressed by Goethe and added another musical level to the Faust. | Sebastian J\u00fcngelCampus Video Room In March 2019 the Goetheanum opened up a room for videos about anthroposophical ac- tivities. Fran\u00e7ois Croissant is in charge. The western part of the first floor has been rede - signed: the offices of former Executive Council members and a room formerly used for mem - bership files were turned into meeting rooms and an exhibition and video space. This space features two cubes, each with four monitors that show a series of films in a loop. Each monitor is equipped with one set of headphones. The first films shown in March were in con - nection with Waldorf 100, the centenary of Waldorf Education: several parallel films gave insight into Waldorf Schools across the world. This theme was followed, from August to the beginning of September, by glimpses into the work done by the students and teachers at the Visual Art School in Basel in preparation for the exhibition \u00abGesture of Colour/Nature of the In - visible/Plants and Colour\u00bb. The films shown since mid-September include reflections on various anthroposophical activities, such as the renova - tion and painted ceiling of the Main Auditorium and more on Waldorf Education. Fran\u00e7ois Croissant, who is in charge of design - ing and maintaining the space, says that \u00abother themes will be added in the future in order to illustrate, through films, the manifold activities of the Goetheanum as well as its history and that of the School of Spiritual Science.\u00bb Visitors to the Goetheanum and conference attendees can use this space free of charge to learn more about applied anthroposophy or selected art exhibitions. | Sebastian J\u00fcngelMedical Section Eurythmy therapy In the autumn of 2020 a new state recog- nized basic training in eurythmy therapy will start at the Goetheanum. Following a fifteen-year process, the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Inno - vation decided on 14 January 2016 to include eurythmy therapy as a recognized method of complementary medicine in Switzerland. In re - turn, the authorities expect that the training is accredited from the first year up to the diploma granted by the Swiss Organization for Comple - mentary Therapies. Once students have com - pleted their training successfully a part of the study expenses will be reimbursed by the state. The new four- to five-year basic eurythmy therapy training (offered in German, or English on demand) integrates all the important ele - ments of a eurythmy foundation training into the eurythmy therapy training, placing particular emphasis on medical and anthropological stud - ies and professional therapeutic qualities and competences. Since Switzerland is a pioneer internation - ally when it comes to the official recognition of eurythmy therapy as a medical profession, this project is also of strategic importance globally. In individual cases, the various qualifications acquired in Switzerland have been accepted in EU countries as being on a par with a Bachelor's or Master's degree. The existing Dornach part-time training in eurythmy therapy which leads to a diploma will continue in parallel to the new training. | Kaspar Zett, Dornach ( ch), for the faculty The next Faust discussion evening will take place on 19 February 2020, 6 p.m., at the Goetheanum (costumes, stage set, lights) See also Events, page 4.

The Solovetsky Islands were once an influential monastic centre in the White Sea, created in 1429 by the monks Herman and Savvaty who established the Orthodox cross here, and Zosima, who founded the monastery. After the Russian Revolution the complex was transformed into a Gulag, a prototype for the Soviet forced labour camps. The horrors of this camp are like the outer layer of dark varnish and candle soot that hide the icon and makes it unrecognizable. In even earlier times, this was a mystery site. On aerial photographs one can see dozens of mazes, rem - nants of pre-Christian initiation by walking the inner path in outer nature. The summer weeks thus became a crossing of the threshold. We worked with the geomancer Wolfgang Schneider on the wounds of Gaia, painful memo - ries of mass shootings and torture, with the united power of consciousness of the partici - pants and the artistic-musical improvisation. Much unbornness The impulse to school our perception had taken us into Nordic nature for three summers running: first to the forests and fiords of Southern Nor - way, then to the high mountains (home of the giants), and finally to the radiant light of the mid - night sun on an island south of the Lofoten. Now we travelled further east on approximately the same latitude to this archipelago in the White Sea, a protrusion of the Arctic Barents Sea into the Scandinavian land mass, with the clearest polar ether. Everything becomes wide and soft here, whether the water glimmers brightly in the midnight sun, lies stretched out in a dark blue, or looms in a sombre grey beneath the wind and clouds. There is so much unbornness here, in sea and sky! A grail breeze can be felt on Solovetsky. Not that of the Pyrenees or of Southern England; and a hint only of the Nordic Sampo. This grail belongs wholly to the future, weaving subtly into the fabric that creates friendships between human beings - and eventually skills that grow from social awareness. | Raphael Kleimann, Vinterbro ( no) Anthroposophy Worldwide Web www.summerweek.baldron.orgIndia Arts and crafts education On 21 September 2019, a symposium was held in Mumbai on the importance of arts and crafts in schools. Aban Bana was also invited. From ancient times, India has had a vibrant cul - ture of arts and crafts. However, the teaching of arts and crafts in conventional Indian schools today is at its minimum, considering the school syllabus, which focuses on subjects like science, technology and economics in order to prepare the young people for the regular job market. Arts and crafts are seen as extracurricular activities, to be relegated to after school hours and to be indulged in by those who are not capable of passing in so-called academic subjects. Therefore, a symposium was addressed to the given situation of teaching art in conventional schools. The symposium was co-organised by prestigious organisations like avid Learning, Fed - eration of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( ficci ), Art1st (Art First) and the Mumbai chapter of Art Education Roundtables ( aer). Since I am the Country Representative of the Anthroposophical Society in India, and an active member of the Rudolf Steiner/Waldorf Educa - tion Movement in India, I was invited to take part as one of the nine speakers. My subject was the importance of Art in Wal - dorf Education. Art, which strengthens the heart forces, ennobles the human being to become a caring and responsible world citizen. I gave examples of how art is embedded in the very core of all subjects taught and is fully integrated into the curriculum. Importance is given to the threefold human being, represented by the head, heart and limbs. I ended my talk and panel discussion with the poem The Waldorf Impulse, which I wrote for the 100 years of Waldorf Education. | Aban Bana, Mumbai ( in)Turkey Songs, eurythmy, and ... The training seminar for teachers and educa- tors in Istanbul has published a songbook with 81 Turkish songs, some of them newly composed. A selection of songs was per - formed in eurythmy by the students. Bringing out a songbook for Waldorf kindergar - tens and lower school classes in Turkey has been a long-felt wish and it is the more special that it has come out in the year when we celebrate not only 100 years of Waldorf Education but also 10 years of Waldorf Educator and Teacher training in Istanbul. A year was spent composing new tunes and collecting traditional Turkish children's songs. The book also includes tried and tested poems and songs - for instance by Hedwig Diestel, Mari - anne Garff, Alfred Baur, and Rudolf Steiner - that are widely used in German kindergartens and have been translated into Turkish and set to music. Pictures kindly made available by Bettina Stietencron, Angela Koonda and five Waldorf pupils illustrate the songbook which could only be printed thanks to donations from Waldorf parents in Hamburg/Nienstedten. The seminar's second-year students used sev - enteen of the songs in the book for a eurythmy performance in Istanbul on 4 August. After two weeks of eurythmy and drama lessons, sixty students were ready to perform the Turkish al - phabet and basic elements of eurythmy. Then they sang and played the children's songs and in the end also presented them in eurythmy, as well as Edvard Grieg's Holberg Suite. Here too, the students demonstrated their talent for movement: in Turkey everyone lives in music! Under the direction of the Turkish theatre direc - tor Muzaffer Aksoy, the students also performed short scenes from Shakespeare's Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice. | Roberto Luca Pellacini, Hamburg ( de), and Tarhan Onur, Avid LearningThe songbook Dada Gece (Night on the mountain) can be purchased from egitimsana- tidostlaridernegi@gmail.com (Istanbul) or pel- lacini@gmx.net Ch. M\u00f6llmann Publishing Ch. M\u00f6llmann Verlag looks back on 25 years of book and music publishing - mainly in Ger - man but with a few English and Russian titles. Ch. M\u00f6llmann Publishing occupies a space of around 40 square meters for office, production and storage. Surely that should say 400 square meters! No: it is actually 40! Christoph M\u00f6ll - mann is a specialist in small figures. He has run this enterprise as manager, editor, typesetter, contact person for authors, and in other roles to do with books, supported by his co-proprietor Angelika Gausmann and two co-workers in type - setting and sales. Focusing on small editions, Ch. M\u00f6llmann Pub - lishing make many things possible, because Chris- toph M\u00f6llmann is keen to promote the spiritual life by publishing works of authors who contrib - ute to it. Even if editions tend to be small at first, it is possible that hundreds or thousands of copies of a particular title will sell later on. But Christoph M\u00f6llmann does not accept every manuscript. He is also fully committed to the anthropo - sophical cultural impulse and his enterprise is part of an association located around the an - throposophical centre at Hamborn Castle. The titles he publishes, whether they are specialist reading, literature or musical scores, all have to do with anthroposophy. Since the first finger exercises - wedding cards for a Turkish family - Ch. M\u00f6llmann have published more than 400 books and around 80 music volumes. One of the authors is Tatiana Kisseleva (A Life for Eurythmy) and among the composers are Esther and Raimund Schwedeler, whose complete works have largely been pub - lished by Ch. M\u00f6llmann and are also available electronically. Christoph M\u00f6llmann has him - self also turned author and written a history of Hamborn Castle. | Sebastian J\u00fcngel Anthroposophy Worldwide Denmark Luciaklinikken Many decades of hard work preceded the opening, on 1 July 2017, of the Luciaklinikken, an anthroposophic hospital with twenty beds near Odense. The hospital has now been accredited. A Danish entrepreneur bought the old castle, Dallund Slot, which previously served as a re - habilitation centre, and made it available to the owners of Luciaklinikken. With further financial support and the voluntary help of numerous people from the area it has been possible to ren - ovate and furnish the building. Nanna Rebecca Kirkebjerg, a gp and anthroposophic physician, is the hospital director. The hospital, which has twenty beds and 15 part-time staff, offers therapies as well as treatment following surgery, for cancer, stress, ptsd , autoimmune disease and for patients with Burnout syndrome. One of its aims is to conduct research into psychosomatic medicine, for instance in cooperation with the Univer - sity of Southern Denmark in Odense. Further cooperation is sought with the city of Odense (more than 185,000 inhabitants) and the region of Southern Denmark (around a million inhabit - ants) as well as with patient organizations and private health insurers. Funding In Denmark the health sector is generally funded through tax money but, for the time being, the patients in this private hospital will have to pay their own costs. It is therefore good to know that Luciaklinikken is already financially healthy. | Peter Alsted Pedersen, Soeborg dk)Switzerland Euchore Ensemble This autumn, the Euchore eurythmy ensem - ble will continue with its studies of Lili Rein - itzer forms based on the work of **Annemarie Dubach-Donath. Euchore is an international ensemble. Some of the eurythmists join the rehearsals in Dor - nach ( ch) from northern Germany, Munich in the south of Germany, Avignon in France and other places in Europe. The fact that the group continues to be active is owed to eurythmists who used to work personally with its founder, Lili Reinitzer. Before her death in 2017, Lili Rein - itzer entrusted to their care Josef Gunzinger's symphonic composition Saturn . The Euchore Ensemble grew out of the \u00abStud - ies for the extension of artistic eurythmy\u00bb which Lili Reinitzer began to offer in Dornach in 1982 as a professional development opportunity for qualified eurythmists. The training focused mainly on the spatial structure of the eurythmy forms given by Annemarie Dubach-Donath but also on rhythms, colours, steps and style. Out of this work the Euchore Ensemble was formed in 1992. One of its central tasks since 1999 has been to work on Josef Gunzinger's Saturn and Annemarie Dubach-Donath's silent eurythmic composition Evolution of the Sun , both of which Lili Reinitzer took over from their composers. In addition, Euchore performs almost annually major choral eurythmy works, including Anton Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. Following a break, the Ensemble started per - forming again in 2018. It consists of a core group and other eurythmists who are interested in Annemarie Dubach-Donath's forms. This au - tumn, two members of the Ensemble will also take up the studies again. | Sebastian J\u00fcngel Performance (with a lecture by Peter Selg) 16 No - vember, Rudolf-Steiner-Schule Berlin Dahlem the Surrounded www.luciaklinikken.dk Image Dallund Slot meeting in the din - ing room, Morten Kj\u00e6rgaard 10 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 11/19 Forum Fashion design with Eva Gronbach After attending the Waldorf School and passing her Abitur at a secondary school in Bonn ( de) Eva Gronbach trained as a dressmaker in D\u00fcsseldorf ( de) before studying fashion design in Brussels ( be) and Paris ( fr). She designed uniforms for Thalys and Novotel, worked for Yohji Yamamoto and Stephen Jones, designed the official fan shirts for the 2006 Football World Cup and creates her own collec - tions. Her active involvement with Waldorf 100 took her to the Friends of Rudolf Steiner's Educa - tion where the idea for the photo - book \u00abInsights Worldwide - 100 Years of Waldorf Education\u00bb was conceived. Kehrer Publishing ( de) has published the book in collabo - ration with Leica. Working in fashion brings up questions of identity, belonging and demarcation: Who am I? How do I become conscious of that? Who do I want to belong to? Who do I want to dissociate myself from? It is therefore not surprising that young people in particu - lar speak out when it comes to fashion - everyone has a right to their own new departures, espe - cially at this time of life. Another advantage of fashion is that it is concrete and tangible. It al - lows for communication across language barriers, for instance in classrooms with refugees. The story behind our clothes As part of the project Being Fash - ion Conscious I ask young people to reflect on their clothes. They describe what they wear and where they get it from, maybe even what they paid for it. Occa - sionally we also talk about what they don't wear. One refugee spoke about a jacket his mother gave him to take along, a jacket with many pockets. On his jour - ney it got caught on a border fence and, because he had to run, he left it behind. As he talked about this we realized how much of a story a jacket can tell, even to us who hadn't even seen it. Or I ask them to bring in a piece of clothing from home. Often the young people bring in something special, something that has some significance within their family: a mirror dress from Afghanistan, a colourful African print dress, an Indian sari or a Bavarian \u00abdirndl\u00bb. This task often sets off a certain dynamic because the family now asks questions like: Where do I come from? Memories come up - one talks together and shares experiences. Close to the fabric The next step is to ask: Where are you going? The young people begin to draw pieces of cloth - ing. They don't need instruc -tions - they can all draw! I merely encourage them not to copy other people's designs or existing labels. The drawings and designs are then pinned up and we look at them together. This confronts them with the idea before they enter into the production process. The next step is the execution, the sewing. They usually need help with this, for instance advice on how the fabric needs to be treated, how one best irons and sews it. In my experience sewing by hand is more immediate than using a sewing machine: apply - ing stitch after stitch, very close to the fabric. This also creates interaction, for often the moth - ers, grandmothers, or even the fathers join in and help. After three to four days it is done: the pieces of clothing - all of them unique - can be tried on: an immediate experience of success. For the young people it is also important that they can present their work to an audience. It motivates them; they become more critical and make more of an effort. In my experience the young people hardly judge each other; it is more that they are surprised at each other's achievement. This creates respect. They see how each one has their strength. This is about acceptance: How do I meet myself? How do I meet others? One gets better at read - ing codes others are using. This makes young people more independent; they emancipate themselves from many things that used to influence them to a greater or lesser extent. Meditating on clothes We can all think about the clothes we wear, where they come from, as in one of Rudolf Steiner's sub - sidiary exercises: where were they produced? Under what working conditions? How are they sewn? From what fabrics? We can also reflect on our attitude to shop - ping and how we feel when we put on a piece of clothing and what it is like when we make changes to it. Finally, we can also imagine what effect what we wear has on others. Then it can happen that a previously anony - mous piece of clothing begins to belong to us (particularly, of course, if we've made it our - selves).| Eva Gronbach, Berlin ( de) Web www.evagronbach.com Image Workshop at EuropeFiction 2019, Eva Gronbach Kokoro - heart connection: how is Yoichi Usami?

I warmly thank the writers of these impres - sive accounts which were grate - fully received. The editorial, too, conveyed important messages. Here are a few short quotations to remind us: \u00abThe history of the Anthropo - sophical Society has been written, one could say, since Rudolf Stein - er's death [...]. It is what we are building on.\u00bb Followed by, \u00abBut the future is open and depends on our present actions [...]\u00bb and finally, \u00abwe can overcome our fear [...] with images of a future we want.\u00bb That's it! Understanding destiny What do we want? What do we strive for? For instance: build - ing what needs to be created on what has evolved in such a way that it sits on top like a new level (the architectural version). Or, out of a different mood altogether: \u00abJust leave the ballast of the past behind! Our motto is \u00abFull speed ahead\u00bb (the sporty version). And so on, at pleasure. ... What seems to be missing is a much more inconvenient ver - sion that we, because it's more comfortable to do so, avoid like a cold shower. This inconvenient version would require us to get a clear view of the Anthroposophi - cal Society's \u00abchildhood\u00bb which was in fact burdened by the deepest sorrow. This trauma does indeed need urgent therapy or a thorough history-taking of its de - formed \u00abroot sprouts\u00bb, so that the original ground can be uncovered and become visible, in which the seed of the future being Anthro - posophy can be newly found again and again through free deeds of knowledge. New original sprouts can then spring up and grow through the phase that has been written into ever new metamor -phoses of anthroposophy. This \u00abtrauma therapy\u00bb can be helped by the rigorous basic research that is and has been carried out quietly and freely by a number of people. Studying both the sources and the future Initial meetings are now being planned in which a research synthesis could be achieved. This would bring new wind to the open-future direction without being one-sidedly sporty or otherwise. The successful study - ing of both the sources and the future depends, as we all know, on a genuine scientific attitude and the genuine wish to work to - gether, and on word and deed be - coming one. Only where the word becomes deed can it be heard and can it be true on earth. Paying lip service alone, as we see it daily in politics, creates frustration and a sense of powerlessness. With warm and hopeful greet - ings and wishes to those who are directly involved in setting the course for the future. | Maja Schmid, Kreuzlingen ( ch) Correction Anthroposophic medicines In Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2019 it said on page 12 that there was \u00aba ban on anthro - posophic medicines in the Netherlands.\u00bb This should say that only a few anthropo - sophic medicines are licensed and officially allowed to be sold.

The founder - who is himself a nurse with experience in management and lead - ership - advocates the abolition of unneces - sary administrative superstructures in favour of teams of self-determined professionals who can focus on their actual jobs. Buurtzorg consistently reduces documentation and bureaucracy to an absolute minimum, while creative and individual solutions for the good of the patients are their main concern.

In harmony and conflict Hanspeter Niggli and Niklaus Sch\u00e4r (and others) from CoOpera make sure that pension money can become effective in the real economy. If one considers that up to 90 per cent of the global speculative exchange transactions use pension and insurance moneys, one can imagine what it means that CoOpera with its 7000 pension fund members has withdrawn 810 million Swiss Francs (or one per mille of the total pension fund money in Switzerland) from such speculation in order to let it flow into valuable economic impulses.
