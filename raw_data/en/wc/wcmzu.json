Since 2002 we have laid the foundation that will allowour country to move forward rapidly. In November 2004,we created our Vision \"Madagascar, Naturally \" and we have designed and implemented many programs to support our development. To accelerate and better coordinate the development process and to make a quantum leap, we have created theMadagascar Action Plan, the MAP. The MAP is a bold, five year plan which establishes direction and priorities for thenation from 2007 to 2012. It states the commitments, strategies and actions that will ignite rapid growth , lead to the reduction of poverty , and ensure that the country develops in response to the challenges of globalization and in accordance with the national vision - Madagascar Naturally and the UN Millennium Development Goals. To the people of Madagascar, I invite you to become active participants in the implementation of the MAP. Everyone has a role to play in the work ahead. Rapid developmentwill bring tremendous benefits to all the villages and townsof Madagascar. To my colleagues in the civil service, we now must face the challenge of strengthening the efficiency of the publicadministration to respond to the expectations of the population through provision of quality services. We also should improveour capacity to absorb and use efficiently all resources that are available to us from the international community and thedonors. And we will benefit from our efforts. The time has come to reconsider the status of public servants in the Public Administration. I promise to do so. The Public Administration is the lead employer nationwide. We, its employees, are \"public servants\" and we must be the examples of true serviceand professionalism. We should show devotion, courage, integrity, and merit. To the private sector, you are central to the achievement of the MAP goals. We are committed to becoming a high- growth economy and making a quantum leap in our development. We must promote participation of local enterprises in all sectors of the economy to create rapid employment growth. We must attract more foreigninvestors to support our economy. The time has come to provide strong support to the rapid and broad developmentof the private sector to increase production of quality and competitive goods suitable for export to regional andinternational markets. Our policy is based on the spreading of investments that will contribute to employment creation,to the strengthening of professional education, and to the improvement of the living conditions of the Malagasy people. To our development partners, the international community, and the donors, you have played a vital role in the development of Madagascar. I thank you on behalf of all the Malagasy people. And I would like to gratefully thank you in advance for the substantial support that you will provide us for the implementation of the MAP. We need your assistance andstrong cooperation to improve the infrastructure, develop the educational system, promote rural development, and createa comprehensive health sector that aggressively addresses family planning and the fight against HIV/AIDS. Mutual trustis crucial to success. We will continue to strengthen this partnership. As President of the Republic of Madagascar, I publicly declare my commitment to providing the necessary leadership for the MAP to contribute to the rapid and sustainable development of Madagascar. We will succeed. God bless our country,00302 SectionOne 1-25 10/30/06 5:20 PM Page 5 Madagascar will become a prosperous nation.

This is a pioneering effort as we are out to achieve what so many otherdeveloping countries have only dreamt about. We will turn our dream into reality.To do that we must conduct a series of major reforms that we are calling \"BreakthroughReform Initiatives.\" These breakthrough reform initiatives, BRI, are urgent projectsthat require immediate attention, superior leadership, collaboration across ministries,and dedicated resources. BRI 1: Public Finance Reform We have to collect more revenues in order to fund the projects and initiatives in the MAP. This is important inorder to reduce our dependency on donors. As of 2006,this is one of the Government's weakest areas. Madagascarcurrently collects approximately 10% of its GDP from taxesand customs duties. We will increase this figure to 15%by the year 2012. This will necessitate making dramaticchanges in the tax code (making it simple) and the taxadministrative process (making it more efficient, effective,and fair). With the support of the IMF and the World Bank,in the early part of 2007 we will conduct a thorough analysisof the tax code. This will be done with active consultationof the private sector and the civil society. Within the Government, tight budget control and fiscal responsibility will also be promoted. This will necessitateestablishing funding priorities for the government that promotehigh growth and the facilitation of important social programs.BRI 2: Significant Increase In Investment To Promote High Growth Through the ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD OF MADAGASCAR we will create strong sector plans to ensurethe following export-oriented industries can develop rapidly- Manufacturing, agri-business, mining, and tourism. We will begin an international campaign to promote Madagascar as a place to invest. We will prioritize infrastructure projects to support key industries. We will provide appropriate incentives, regulations and policies to facilitate the attraction, growth and expansionof key sectors. We will provide access to land, establish a bold investment law, and create an effective arbitration system to enforce contracts, mediate disputes and ensure security of investments. We will address the impediments and establish a business climate that investors value.02 SectionOne 1-25 Cs.fh11 10/30/06 5:20 PM Page 17 MAP The Madagascar Action Plan Madagascar Naturally 017 BRI 3: Sow The Seeds Of A Green Revolution We will begin the process for creating a green revolution in Madagascar. A green revolution is the flourishing of the fieldsand crops of the farmers to ensure there is no hunger but anabundance of food that can meet domestic needs and also beused for export purposes. As of 2006, Madagascar was animporter of rice. Over the next few years Madagascar willbecome an exporter of rice and other crops. To facilitate thegreen revolution, the government will ensure that the neededseeds, fertilizers, and training are provided to the farmers,and new cooperative processes are established to help in thecollection and distribution of harvests. BRI 4: Transform Public Security In regards to security, the dahalo (cattle rustlers) of the ruralareas are a real annoyance and a serious impediment toprogress. Also, we have a serious problem with smugglingof precious stones and timber, and illegal fishing. We willnot simply reform security but transform our security systemto ensure that Madagascar is a safe and secure place to live,farm, travel, invest, and conduct business.BRI 5: Implement Bold New Measures For Health And Family Planning Our population rate is increasing too rapidly. Family size needs to be reduced. In some rural areas there are 7 to 10children per household. Contraceptives and birth controladvice will be made available to reduce the size of theaverage family. Malaria is rampant in Madagascar. As of 2006 only half of the population is protected when they sleep by bed nets.We have launched the Malaria Project to ensure that within2 years every person has a bed net. Also, we are committed to ensuring that HIV/AIDS never advances like it has throughout many African countries. Asof 2006, only 1% of the population was infected with the AIDSvirus, as compared with 30% in South Africa. We have begunto put in place a \"best practice\" strategy on HIV/AIDS policy. BRI 6: Transform The Judiciary We will undertake a series of major reforms of the judicialsystem - commercial courts, sentencing guidelines and prisonsystem - to ensure that the people and investors have completeconfidence and trust in the system. The judiciary must beefficient, effective and operate with utmost integrity. 02 SectionOne 1-25 Cs.fh11 10/30/06 5:20 PM Page 18 Madagascar Naturally MAP The Madagascar Action Plan THE HUMAN BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE MAP People make it happen018 The MAP is about people - the Malagasy people.To achieve our goals,some of our values,habits, practices andpriorities will need tochange. But hand inhand, shoulder toshoulder and heart toheart - we can do it. To succeed, we will need to attend to the humanbuilding blocks thatprovide the foundationfor a transformation.1. Develop Leadership Capacity Fundamentally, leadership is about mobilizing others to face reality, solve problems, produce resources, and achieve goals.We need strong leaders in all our institutions - the government,businesses, churches, schools, and civil society to do thiswork. By virtue of being at one time a colonized country, asocialist country, and a donor-dependent country, too manypeople have developed the habit of waiting for someone elseto provide leadership. That now has to change. To provide the needed leadership to make the MAP a reality, we will actively seek out and reward \"top performers\" andput them in important positions of responsibility so that theycan drive the reforms.Also, to support the development of leadership capacity we have created the National Leadership Institute of Madagascarat the Presidential palace of Iavoloha. This institute willprovide training and coaching for ministers, secretarygenerals, director generals, chef de region, chef de district,youth leaders, civil society leaders and business leaders. Wewill also be strengthening other educational and traininginstitutions in the country, such as ENAM and the universities. 02 SectionOne 1-25 Cs.fh11 10/30/06 5:20 PM Page 19 MAP The Madagascar Action Plan Madagascar Naturally 019 2. Change Mindsets And Habits We must change the mindsets, habits, practices and processes that get in the way of progress. As a people we must be ableto deal with the threats and dangers that confront us in theage of globalization, and also be able to take advantage ofthe tremendous opportunities and prospects that are nowabundant in the world. Progress necessitates change. Of course, in our culture there is much that is precious and needs to be protected. But someaspects of our traditions and beliefs must be modified or evendiscarded. The leadership work, nationally and locally, is tohelp facilitate this process of change, even loss, throughlistening, dialogue, encouragement and learning. 3. Fight Corruption We are all tired of corruption. Corruption increases the costof doing business and increases the cost of the provision ofgovernment services. The leadership work is to be tough oncorruption in any form - zero tolerance. While being tough,we must also promote a value shift in government and society.Those who engage in corruption, be they local civil servantsor international businessmen, clearly hold a value thatemphasizes self-interest over community or national interest.Leaders must aggressively promote, in their words and deeds,the values and practices that build national solidarity, integrity,and a clean and efficient way of operating.4. Increase Know-how Skills, skills, skills! Madagascar needs rapidly to develop theskills, know-how, and technology to thrive in a competitiveand global environment. This will take time but we mustaccelerate this learning process. Our policy is to useinternational experts to coach and train locals, attract moreoverseas Malagasy back home, and send more Malagasies totraining programs and courses - in the country and abroad. 5. Mobilize People And Resources To make the MAP a reality we need to mobilize anextraordinary level of resources - financial, technical, material,and human. This will require creativity, initiative andleadership. We know we must do at least three things: 1) We must actively seek donor support and assistance - not just from the main donors, but increasingly more from bilateral donors and international foundations. 2) We eventually want to become self-sufficient and reduce our dependency on donors, therefore we must ensurethat our national assets and resources are managed ina way to ensure maximum financial benefits for the country. 3) We will make genuine reforms in the tax regime and customs to allow us to significantly increase governmentrevenues that can then fund our social programs in health,education, security, and rural development.02 SectionOne 10/30/06 5:20 PM Page 21 MAP The Madagascar Action Plan Madagascar Naturally 021 NEW INSTITUTIONS TO SUPPORT THE QUANTUM LEAP The National Leadership Institute of Madagascar: Developing Leadership Capacity for MAP Rapid Development The National Leadership Institute of Madagascar (NLIM) was created in 2006 to provide cutting-edge training to buildleadership capacity at all levels of government and for allsectors of society. The NLIM is committed to training leaders to be professional, operate with integrity, be effective problem solvers and toachieve results. It will operate hand in hand with ENAM (the National School for Public Administration) to develop governmentleadership capacity. The Economic Development Board Of Madagascar: Developing the Business Conditions for MAP Rapid Development The EDBM was set up in 2006 to facilitate and promote private domestic and foreign investment. The EDBM ischarged with ensuring that the business climate of Madagascaris attractive for companies and conducive for the success ofprivate enterprises. 02 SectionOne 1-25 10/30/06 5:20 PM Page 23 MAP The Madagascar Action Plan Madagascar Naturally 023 MAP IMPLEMENTATION SYSTEM The National Vision The vision Madagascar Naturally and the United Nations MillenniumDevelopment Goals are the basis for thecountry's direction and long-term goals.The MAP The MAP five year plan reflects theeight bold commitments required toextricate the country from poverty andlaunch a quantum leap in medium andlong-term development.National Programs The MAP commitments and goals arespecified in greater detail in sectoralNational Programs - health, education,security, transport, etc. Annual Planning The MAP commitments areoperationalized and implementedthrough the annual planning processof The Politique Generale de l\u00e8tat andthe national budget.Donor Coordination Donor Coordination will take placethrough an annual Donor's Conferenceand sector meetings to ensure theefficient harmonization and allocationof funds, and to ensure results areachieved, and there is a sustainableimpact on poverty reduction.Monitoring & Feedback Monitoring and feedback mechanismswill be established so that theGovernment can evaluate progressand 1-25 Cs.fh11 10/30/06 5:20 PM Page 24 Madagascar Naturally MAP The Madagascar Action Plan 024 THE 8 MAP COMMITMENTS We will be a connected nation.

In 2003, a National Plan for Security was created, but due to lack of resources it has not been fully implemented. Zebu and crop theft still exist in many areas. Illegal trafficking in fish, gemstones, gold and timber is of serious concern given its magnitude. Drug cropsthrive in limited areas, feeding smuggling and urban crime. In 2005, about 5,700 Dahalo (cattle thieves) were arrested, an increase of 15% compared to the previous year. Goals1. Madagascar will be a safe country to live in, to travel in and to invest in. 2. All red zones will be clean areas and zebu theft will be significantly diminished. 3. Urban crime will be under control and brought back to an acceptable level. Strategies1. Review current system, adopt best practices, train and develop security forces in improved methodologies. 2. Align the mission of the security forces to national and regional needs and mobilize resources to supportthe mission. 3. Rationalize institutions, improve and reinforce the coordination between security institutions andcivil institutions. 4.

Activities have been undertaken to rapidly increaserevenues from tax and customs. Donors have helped thecountry through budgetary aid and debt relief in the last threeyears. Still, public resources are not sufficient because of lossof revenues due to exemptions, exonerations and poormanagement. Spending allocation, procedures and controlare partially inadequate. Goals1. Laws, regulations and procedures of tax and custom systems will provide sufficient revenues for quality public services. 2. Allocation of public resources will be established through negotiations among ministries, regions and communes onpriorities and needs, before parliamentary decision. 3.

In 2005 alone, 8,982km of roads were rehabilitated or maintained. There has been progress in railway, ports and airports but most activity has been limited to rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. Now we need to ensure long term strategic infrastructure planning is linked to key areas of projected economic growth. Decision making by the Ministry and donors needs to be faster to readjust funding prioritiesin light of changing circumstances and there needs to be a closer engagement with the private sector. The emphasisshould be not just on building new roads but also maintainingexisting ones. Some studies have suggested that overall trade in Madagascar could be 20% higher with the propermaintenance of infrastructure. Goals1. Ensure that all key growth areas will have good access to the transport network. 2. Define clear infrastructure priorities with regard to full economic return on investment - transport will be treatedas an investment rather than a cost. 3. Provide active assistance to high growth industries to access necessary infrastructure quickly and withminimal bureaucracy. 4. Involve the private sector as partners in strategic planning and development, especially for high growth areas. 5. Improve capacity and quality of companies, in construction and operation. 6.

Maintenance needs to be given a higherpriority as there are large losses of existing infrastructure,especially roads, each year. Many communities are stillremote and ways of connecting them to the nationalinfrastructure need to be actively pursued, includingalternative technologies. The number of isolated areas inMadagascar fell from 59% in 2003 to 33% in 2005. Only about600 of the 1,557 communes have access to regular transport(i.e. 10-12 months of the year). This has a flow on effect tomost parts of the economy and a direct impact on poverty inthe regions. Goals1. There will be an effective high quality national transport network for both urban and rural areas. 2. Expand maintenance programs with emphasis on maximizing the total volume of usable infrastructure. 3. We will seriously explore opportunities for alternative forms of transport as a way of connecting remote areas. 4. There will be an increase use of local materials and human resources and the provision of training. Strategies1. Manage existing infrastructure as a national asset which requires maintenance and investment. 2. Rehabilitation of key transport corridors and infrastructures which have fallen into disrepair including canals andremote airstrips. 3. Investigate alternative transport technologies for linking remote areas. 4. Encourage alternative forms of transport which use low- cost energy or energy produced locally. 5.

Simultaneously,there has been a decrease in the proportion of hydroelectricpower generation leading to a greater reliance on thermalproduction. Thermal production accounted for 21% of totalpower generation in 1997 but rose to 35% by 2004. As of 2006, the national energy company JIRAMA has not been structured to meet the increasing demand for energyrequired for the high growth economy. This is due to lackof finance, old equipment and machinery, and an inadequatemanagement system; significant reforms however areunderway. JIRAMA has announced that throughout 2007,all the major power consumption centers will be equippedwith new power stations which will meet the anticipateddemand growth for the next 3 to 5 years. Goals1. All urban and rural areas will have access to a reliable, sustainable and affordable electricity supply includingincreased urban coverage of 74% by 2011 and ruralcoverage of 10% by 2011. 2. We will have competition in the electricity sector and the development of Public Private Partnerships. 3. There will be sufficient supply to meet all new connections especially for high growth investments. 4.

This partly explains the fact that in first year of the primary school, approximately one out of four pupils drops out of school. Development projects of the pre- school centers were indeed carried out during several decades, but the pre-school cover rate remains very low. The greatmajority of children who attend pre-school are from urban areas that have many private schools. Goals1. All children between 0 and 5 years old will be receiving care and support for development throughparental education. 2. The pre-school education system will be available all across Madagascar with an enrolment rate of at least 20%. 3. The teachers of pre-school will have received good training, and will be motivated through appropriate remunerationand the recognition of their importance. 4. The local authorities and communities will bring sustainable support to the pre-school centres of their locality. Strategies 1. Develop a national pre-school strategy.2.

It represents a necessary stage for the development of the society and for the eradication of poverty. From an economic point of view, education is an investment: today it represents an expenditure which will produce a supplement of wealth as well as well- being tomorrow. The Malagasy Government began to reform the education system in 2003 with the launch of the national plan \"Education For All\" (EPT). Progress has been made with the total numberof pupils in primary education increasing from 1.7 million during the school year 1997-1998 to 3.7 million in 2005-2006.However, this success in terms of schooling remains relativeinsofar as the school retention rate and the internaleffectiveness has yet to be significantly improved. There are differences on the level of the access and the internal effectiveness of the educational system according tothe socio-economic origin of the pupils and between ruraland urban zone. It is proven now that 5 years of mandatoryschooling are not sufficient to allow a sustainable eliminationof illiteracy, the building of job competencies and thedevelopment of human capital for the nation. The government therefore has proposed to reform the education system, which is currently structured as 5 yearsof primary, 4 years of lower secondary and 3 years of uppersecondary to lengthen the primary cycle to 7 years andre-organize the lower and upper secondary cycles in linewith this reform. The reform of fundamental education will make it possible for Madagascar to increase the average number of years ofstudies, and to improve the educational level of the population.

As of 2006, in Madagascarapproximately 48% of the population 15 year old and aboveare illiterate. There are more than 1 million young peoplefrom 11 to 17 years who are illiterate. Training methodologiestraining such as AFI-D, Asama, and Ambohitsoratra gaveencouraging results but their scope needs to be broadened.Currently, financial resources from government budget aswell as from international partners are limited. GoalsMadagascar will reach the Millennium Development Goals of halving the illiteracy rate of adolescents adults from itslevel in 1990 to 2015. Reducing illiteracy will also play acatalyst role to promote self-fulfilment of rural young people,to develop entrepreneurship spirit and to encourage personalrisk and initiative taking. Strategies1. To intensify literacy education activities outside the regular school programs to target young and adult illiterate. 2. To provide specific curricula to 11 - 17 years old young illiterate people to allow them to catch up with the regularschool programs, particularly through ASAMA activities (alternative education). 3. To carry out large campaign of awareness raising on fight against illiteracy. 4.

These activities arecurrently carried out by youth associations and in Youth andSports Centers (CAPJI and Youth Houses). Sports and Youthevents are organized to sharpen the sense of respect for rules,develop team work and instill discipline. The Boy-scouts and Girl-scouts are active in Madagascar and make important contribution to the social development. Also,most churches have youth organizations that teach youngpeople values and social service. These activities mustcontinue to be encouraged. GoalsThe spirit and mentality shaped through sports ethics and extra-school activities will lead to a better way of life for theMalagasy young people. Participation of young people inyouth associations, sports programs and communityorganizations will contribute to smoother job-entry, job-stability and civic responsibility.

The delivering rhythm is 1,000 per year. As of 2006, 10 percent of the national territory was legally occupied with title or certificates. In 2005, the Government launched the National Land Tenure Program including the facilitation of land tenure transaction and the setting up of 21 land tenure offices (one stop shop) till December 2006. However, to allow strong motivation of private actors in production, the spatial coverageof land titling and the title delivering rhythm need to be substantially enhanced. The current legal system does notmeet the requirements of neither peasants nor large scaleagricultural investment. GoalsThe land tenure system will be responsibly employed for the following roles/objectives: social objective, economic objective,ecological objective. The land tenure system will activelyencourage private initiative in production, for small as wellas large scale actors. All land owners will feel secure, in ruralas well as urban areas. Strategies1. Modernize and computerize the land property and topographic records. 2. Decentralize land property management at commune (region) level. 3. Reform the legal framework.4.

To address the need, microfinance institutions have established some rural offices. As of 2006, seven authorized microfinance institutions are operating, along with other on- the-field running initiatives. It emerges from the present situation that the access to credit remains limited although the rate of penetration has markedly improved over the years (from 3% in 2003 to 6% in 2005). This is closely linked to thehigh interest rates and excessive guarantees from the financial institutions. GoalsFinancing methods in rural areas, at accessible rates, will enable the financing of investments in the medium andlong term allotted to the development of activities of ruraloperators. Poor and low-income households will have theopportunity to access credit at lower cost so as to allow themto undertake income-generating activities. Strategies1.

In 2005, rice production rose to 3,420,000tons, that is an increase of 13% compared to the level of 2004.However, Malagasy agriculture is characterized by its lowproductivity with average yields of around 2 tons per hectare.The problem lies in the low utilization of fertilizers andimproved seeds as well as in the poor performance ofagricultural equipment. GoalsAgricultural mechanization will be expanded and new agricultural techniques will be implemented. Substantialincrease of both production and productivity will ensure foodsecurity and release surplus for export. The green revolutionwill improve non productive lands in rural areas and improveincome levels. Strategies1. Intensification and improvement of productivity.2.

Vertical integration exists only forvery few products resulting in low value added. Supply chainsare not sufficiently developed and organized. Great potentialcan be exploited by extending the value chain in variousagricultural sectors in order to increase substantially thevalue added from agriculture, stock breeding, and fisheries. GoalsFarmers will consistently provide the market with more value added processed products that meet the demand of endconsumers, that will equally benefit the buyers. Most of theprocessing of the products for exports will be carried outlocally. The local farmers will be connected to domestic,regional and international networks and value chains andwill improve their market share accordingly Strategies1.

Import demand has kept downward pressure on the Ariary that has been slowly depreciating. Exports have suffered from the phasing out of the Multi-Fibre Agreement and from the low price of vanilla in the world market. Export Processing Zones have lost 10,000 jobs due to competition in garments from China and India.External sector outlook and economic growth will dependvery much on how attractive Madagascar will be for international investors and how fast the country can developits minerals and oil resources. Current account deficit has been high, reaching 11.7% of GDP in 2005. Economic growth was 4.6% in 2005. While the budget deficit is expected to fall to 4% of GDP for 2006, there has been a significant shortfallin revenue collection by the government. Goals 1. Achieve sustainable macroeconomic stability with low inflation. 2. Eliminate macroeconomic imbalances. Strategies 1.

However,FDI has been very low for a well-endowed country likeMadagascar. The country attracted only USD 85 million in2005. It is ranked 131 ST in the \"Doing Business Indicators' (DBI) of the World Bank, a very low ranking for a countrythat has not seen major political and social upheaval. In 2006,the Government established the Economic DevelopmentBoard of Madagascar to improve the investment climate andalso created a new investment law that would cut red tapeand provide a package of incentives that would serve toenhance Madagascar's attractiveness and promote a muchhigher level of FDI as well as encourage existing industriesto expand production.

As an island, Madagascar has5,000 unspoiled kilometres of coastline and a climate whichis favorable to the development of all forms of eco-tourism. However, because of the lack of infrastructure, suitable accommodation and connection to some regional hubs, thenumber of tourists coming to Madagascar is only about 150,000per year, generating a revenue of about $US 200 millions.However, inspite of the constraints, tourism ranks among themain providers of foreign currencies for the Malagasyeconomy. The sector is in constant expansion with 19%increase in revenues in 2005. The Government is committedto aggressively developing and promoting tourism. GoalsMadagascar will be a privileged destination for all categories of tourism, with a primary focus given to eco-tourism.International hotel chains will be encouraged to invest inMadagascar, so as to solve the problem linked to the lack ofinfrastructure and suitable accommodation.

Such biodiversity is concentrated in the forest ecosystems which are constantly losing ground to agricultural activity.Losing one hectare of forest in Madagascar has a more serious effect on the world biodiversity than losing one hectare of forest elsewhere. From a scientific viewpoint, it means the disappearance of several thousands of species, which do notexist anywhere else. Therefore, Madagascar is obliged to preserve endemic biodiversity through responsible governancefor protected areas which will be managed either by the State,private entities, or local communities or put under co-management. 10 cOMMITMENT_96-105 Cs.fh11 10/30/06 5:39 PM Page 4 MAP The Madagascar Action Plan | Commitment 7 | CHERISH THE ENVIRONMENT Madagascar Naturally 099 ENVIRONMENT PROJECT LEADER 1.

The goal is in line with the objective assigned by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and it accounts for 10% of the national territory allocated forecological balance. Furthermore, Madagascar will abide by the Kyoto Accords and international climate change agreements to ensure thatMadagascar is a green country that contributes not just tonational well-being but to global well-being. Strategies1. Establish new land, lake, marine and coastal protected areas. 2. Ensure financial sustainability for the management of protected areas and the biodiversity 3.

Thisis compounded by the lack of professionalism among forestoperators who behave like economic operators who areconcerned more about short term profit and interest. Inaddition, most Malagasy people use wood and its byproductsas an energy source because they do not require preliminaryinvestment in equipment and the product may be purchasedin a periodic manner. Apart from such actions, vegetationand clearing fires caused by farmers are a serious cause offorest and natural resource degradation. Currently the area of Madagascar forests and wetlands with endemic flora and fauna is 9,000,000ha. But these forests areendangered and must be preserved by setting up sustainablenatural resource management sites. GoalsMadagascar commits to keep its 9m hectare forest and wetland area for the conservation of its natural richnessand the sustainable use of its forest, lake, marine andcoastal resources. Strategies1. Develop and implement sustainable use plans for land, lake, marine, and coastal areas. 2. Promote the development and use of alternative energy resources such as bio-fuels that include palm oil, jatropha,soy and sugar cane. 3. Manage the clearing of vegetation and the damage caused by fires. 4. Promote reforestation and restore degraded habitats.5. Promote private sector financing to assist in environmental management.

Prevention and precautionmechanisms were initiated in the country through environmentalimpact and assessment studies, for the protection of sensitivezones (decree MECIE N \u00b0 99/954 on 15/12/99 and its riders). The environmental dimension must be mainstreamed into thedevelopment actions at all levels and into the sectoral, regional,and communal plans and policies, and into the business plansof companies. Currently all 22 region development plans includea part on the environment. Also, in keeping with landmanagement, the biggest cities have town master-plans whichintegrate the environmental dimension. Environmental educationand communication hold an important place in these plans. Goals We will mainstream the environment into all sectoral plans and develop a strong and effective environmental reflex. Strategies1. Explore ways that the government (national, regional and local) with the help of the private sector can assist inenvironmental protection and ensure that the highestglobal standards are met. 2. Strengthen the framework for preventing environmental damage (including pollution) caused by businesses, miners,farmers, fishermen, and tourism. 3. Contribute to the protection of sensitive zones through comprehensive environmental assessment. 4. Internalize the environmental stake into sectoral, regional, and communal policies. 5.

A consequence is that the forestadministration, which has become easy to bypass, has notbeen able to enact its mission and has watched on the sidelinesas the forests have been abused. Therefore, since 2003 the Government has begun to implement some profound changes within the sector suchas the accountability of all stakeholders involved in themanagement of natural resources, the enforcement of laws,and the strengthening of forest and environment controls.While the Government has articulated a firm and strongvision, the capacity to enforce that vision through coordinationand more resources must be further developed. Goals 1. To strengthen the institutions responsible for environmental management - the Ministry and environmental protectionagencies - to ensure a professional policy making and regulatory framework and to provide technical support tothe development and implementation of sector strategies. 2. As a specific goal - As of 2006 the number of forest and environmental offenses are in the order of 440 per year. The target in implementing various changes at the sectorlevel consists in reducing the offense number of 440 to nomore than 100 in 2.Strategies 1. Build human, material, infrastructure capacities in the Ministry to ensure it can effectively pursue its mission. 2. Strengthen forest and environmental regulation, enforcement and control. 3. Implement sustainable forest management techniques and forest plantations in appropriate areas to satisfy the demand for forestry products and tree seedlings and othermeasures to support forestation. 4. Improve the forest revenue system and reform tax laws to ensure a taxation on negative consequences that contributeto pollution and degradation. 5. Provide for the planning, monitoring, evaluation of all activities of the Ministry, and ensure better coordination,management, dissemination, and use of research, data andbest-practices at the national, regional and local levels.
