We use national, linked [electronic] [health]data in [England]to assess the impact of COVID-19 [vaccination]and positive [SARS-CoV-2]tests on the [risk]of cardiac and all-cause [mortality]in young people (12 to 29 years) using a [self]-controlled case series design. Here, we show there is no significant increase in cardiac or all-cause [mortality]in the 12 weeks following COVID-19 [vaccination]compared to more than 12 weeks after any [dose]. However, we find an increase in [cardiac death]in [women]after a first [dose]of non [mRNA vaccines]. A [SARS-CoV-2]test is associated with increased cardiac and all-cause [mortality]among people vaccinated or unvaccinated at [time]of testing.
