I thus routinely work with a medically qualified anthroposophic doctor and sometimes art therapists, masseurs and movement therapists. When more minds than one focus on a problem we can create an effective circle of warmth, containment, holding and healing. However, there will be no pressure to do this. The decision will be yours. Anthroposophic medicine uses a range of homeopathic medicines (and occasionally herbal medicines) based on anthroposophical holistic principles. It is a complementary and alternative (CAM) approach to healing.
