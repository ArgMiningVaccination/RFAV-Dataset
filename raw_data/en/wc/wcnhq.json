Reasons to Perform SARS-CoV-2 Testing Current and Potential Purposes of SARS-CoV-2 Testing Diagnosis Prognosis Confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with symptoms Assessment of COVID-19 disease severity and/or risk of progression * Antibodies are a protein the body's immune system produces in response to an infection. Antibodies identify the infection as foreign and direct other parts of the immune system to attack and neutralize/destroy the infection. The presence of anti-virus antibodies does not necessarily mean a person is immune to future infection. We are still learning about the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.

Patients with Suspected Active Infection Exposed Individuals and/or Those With Known Previous Infection (Potential) Immunity Status Exposure Screening/ Infection History Determine if a patient was previously infected with SARS- CoV-2 (whether or not they had symptoms) Primarily for population surveillance by tracking cases (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and exposure of those close to known infections Assess the presence of (potential) immunity due to previous infection based on presence and/or amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response (in the form of antibodies*) Demystifying SARS-CoV-2 Testing: First Edition 12April 16, 2020 Clinical Reason for Testing What the Test Measures SARS-CoV-2 Virus To confirm1 an ongoing/current infection, the virus itself must be detected in the body Combination of Virus, Antibody, and Health Tests To date, this is unclear Likely a combination of virus, anti-virus immune response, and other parameters (e.g., # of blood cells) Anti-virus Antibodies2 To determine prior infection or likelihood to be immune, a test looks for the presence of anti-virus antibodies produced by the immune system The presence of anti-virus antibodies does not definitively indicate a person is immune Diagnosis requires detecting the virus in the body, while screening for exposure and immunity status requires detection of anti-virus antibodies. What Tests Measure Diagnosis 1 Anti-virus antibody testing can also help with diagnosis, but should not be used alone for this purpose. 2 Antibodies are a protein the body's immune system produces in response to an infection.

Term Definition Academic A noncommercial research environment, focused on the goal of advancing our collective scientific knowledge base. Assay The procedure used for conducting a diagnostic test. Analyte Entity or target that is being analyzed. Can be an ion, a protein, a cell, a molecule, etc. Automation Line A track system moving samples between instruments as opposed to a \"sneaker network\" which is technicians moving samples through the lab. Biomarker A biological marker of disease. Technically all diagnostics are measuring biomarkers but in market terminology this refers to novel markers linked to personalized medicine. CLIA Waiver Tests receiving a CLIA waiver are low complexity and can be performed by a healthcare worker with no diagnostic training or experience or by the patient themselves. CLIA waivers are a requirement for POC or NPT and apply to the US only. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) CLIA of 1988 created quality standards for all US laboratory testing to ensure accuracy, reliability and timeliness regardless of where the test was performed. Each specific laboratory test system, assay, and examination is graded for level of complexity by assigning scores of 1, 2, or 3 (1 indicates the lowest level of complexity, and 3 indicates the highest level) for each of the following seven criteria: Knowledge; Training and experience; Reagents and materials preparation; Characteristics of operational steps; Calibration, quality control, and proficiency testing materials; Test system troubleshooting and equipment maintenance; Interpretation and judgment. High complexity tests are performed in specialty laboratories. Moderate complexity tests are performed in hospital, reference or physician office laboratories by trained laboratory technicians. Low or CLIA waived tests are typically performed at the point of patient care and can be performed by untrained personnel or even by the patient.

Term Definition Companion Diagnostics (CDx) (HA definition) Diagnostic tests which are used in combination with a specific therapy in order to guide treatment decisions. (FDA definition) In vitro diagnostic device or imaging tool that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The joint application of the diagnostic test and therapeutic are explicitly described in the product labels. Core Lab Hospital laboratory staffed by minimally trained lab technicians performing high volume, moderately complex tests on highly automated instruments. Cost per Reportable A method of financing the cost of an instrument and reagents. Total laboratory costs for running an assay divided by the number of results obtained. This spreads out the cost of \"non-reportable\" results (caused by either sample or analysis error) over all of the useful results. Emergency Room (ER) Emergency room (ER) is the area in a hospital where patients present, are evaluated, and are often treated in an emergency situation. (FDA) IVD The mark given to in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products indicating that the product has been cleared (510k) or approved (PMA) for use as a diagnostic product in the US Manufacturers can market these products to labs for the specific claims included in the product label Grant/Research Grant Non-repayable funding provided by an agency, foundation, trust, or other entity. Typically provided to fund a specific project or objective as outlined in a grant proposal. See R01. Hospital Near Patient Testing (NPT) Testing performed outside of the laboratory, near to the patient in a hospital. These tests are rapid and include both handheld readers and benchtop analyzers. Immunoassay (IA) A discipline of clinical laboratory medicine in which antibodies are used to detect target analytes from body fluids primarily blood. A number of different IA methods are available. IA is typically performed on highly automated instrumentation. Industry A commercial research environment, focused on the goal of developing new products or services which enhance health but also generate financial returns. Information Technology (IT) Technology that encompasses the computer systems and software that control instrumentation as well as results reporting and connections of the lab instruments to the laboratory information system (LIS) and hospital information system (HIS). Installed Base Total number of actively used instruments of a particular type among a group or multiple groups of customers.

Term Definition Integrated Hospital Network (IHN; IDN) A group or system of hospitals and clinics operating jointly to serve their patients. Buying decisions are often made for the entire system at once to provide power in price negotiations with vendors and standardize equipment and products used across the system. These relatively small groups typically drive compliance more effectively than GPOs. Alternatively called an Integrated Delivery Network (IDN). Intended Use/Indications for Use Device classification depends on the intended use of the device and also upon indications for use. For example, a scalpel's intended use is to cut tissue. A subset of intended use arises when a more specialized indication is added in the device's labeling such as, \"for making incisions in the cornea\". Indications for use can be found in the device's labeling, but may also be conveyed orally during sale of the product. the term intended use means the general purpose of the device or its function, and encompasses the indications for use. The term indications for use, as defined in 21 CFR 814.20(b)(3)(i), describes the disease or condition the device will diagnose, treat, prevent, cure or mitigate, including a description of the patient population for which the device is intended.22 Integrated Platform An automated analyzer that has the capability to run both clinical chemistry and immunoassay tests. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Intensive care unit (ICU) is the area in a hospital where patients in critical conditions are treated and monitored. In-Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) or Clinical Diagnostics Market In Vitro Diagnostics Services or products including instruments and reagents that utilize a variety of methods and formats to perform tests on human samples outside the body in order to assess disease risk, diagnose a condition, or monitor a patient's health IVDMIA In Vitro Diagnostics Multivariate Index Assays: Use multiple molecular and non-molecular markers to produce a diagnostic, prognostic and/or predictive index (value) for a patient. Example IVDMIA: Agendia's Mammaprint, a 70-gene, tissue-based assay to determine the risk of breast cancer recurrence post surgery IVD Supplies Market Revenues derived by vendors from sale of instruments, reagents, and service provided to clinical laboratories for IVD purposes. Demystifying SARS-CoV-2 Testing: First Edition 38April 16, 2020 Glossary Source: Health Advances analysis. Term Definition (FDA) IVD The mark given to in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products indicating that the product has been cleared (510k) or approved (PMA) for use as a diagnostic product in the US. Manufacturers can market these products to labs for the specific claims included in the product label Kit A set of reagents manufactured and packaged together for a specific purpose or to detect a specific analyte. Kits can come in RUO or IVD form. These are sold to labs that perform the testing. Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) A test that is developed and validated within a single laboratory and is not sold as a diagnostic kit for other labs to perform. These tests are not approved by the FDA, but rather, are regulated by CLIA (for accuracy, precision, test sensitivity and specificity). These tests may utilize CE and FDA IVD marked products or RUO products to perform the test. In the US, labs must be CLIA certified to perform such testing. Laboratory Testing Market Revenues derived from laboratories performing tests (includes hospital and reference laboratories as well as certified physician office laboratories; does not include near-patient or patient self-testing). By definition, these tests are performed by trained lab personnel and are not CLIA waived. The costs (IVD Supplies Market Revenue) are inherently captured in this revenue. Microbiology A discipline of clinical laboratory medicine used to detect the presence of pathogens in bodily tissues. Performed in a specialty laboratory with a low level of automation. Testing involves slow culture-based (measurement of pathogen growth over time) testing methods. Molecular Diagnostics (MDx) A discipline of laboratory medicine involving the use of testing procedures to measure DNA and/or RNA Despite being measures of molecules, other testing disciplines that assess proteins etc. are NOT considered to be MDx by standard industry terminology. For example, if you ask a lab director if they perform molecular testing, if they are not doing DNA or RNA analysis they will say no. In addition, molecular labs perform only or mostly DNA/RNA analysis methods Multi-analyte Test Type of multiplexing in which multiple analytes are measured and each analyte measured corresponds to one distinct diagnostic answer. Demystifying SARS-CoV-2 Testing: First Edition 39April 16, 2020 Glossary Source: Health Advances analysis. Term Definition Multi-analyte Technology A single platform, instrument, box, or technology that can measure more than one type of analyte at a time with analytes defined as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, ions, cells, etc. Multiplexed Test/Technology Technical definition: Simultaneous measurement of multiple target analytes in a single reaction vessel. Broader market definition: In the marketplace, some technologies that take a single sample input and split that sample (via automation or microfluidics) into individual reaction vessels to perform multiple tests are also considered to be \"multiplex\" technologies. Near-Patient Testing (NPT) Market Revenues derived by vendors from sale of IVD supplies outside the laboratory within the hospital setting. This does not include point-of-care (POC) testing in the physician office. Tests performed in this setting are rapid and must be CLIA waived. They are performed by nurses and physician rather than by trained laboratory professionals. National Institute of Health (NIH) A US government agency dedicated to medical innovation. The largest public funder of biomedical research in the world. Novel Content Newly discovered analytes or biomarkers. Patient Self Testing (PST) Test performed by the patient. Most PST is performed for glucose monitoring at home. All are CLIA waived. Physician Office Laboratory (POL) Laboratory associated with large physician practices performing non-CLIA waived tests. POC testing can also be performed in a physician office but this is not considered laboratory testing. Point-of-Care (POC) Market Revenues derived by vendors from sale of IVD supplies to be used outside of the laboratory. The POC market includes professional POC and patient self testing revenues. Tests are performed either by a healthcare worker or patient. All are CLIA waived. Demystifying SARS-CoV-2 Testing: First Edition 40April 16, 2020 Glossary Source: Health Advances analysis. Term Definition Pre- and Post- Analytic Automation Pre-analytic automation is instrumentation which automates single or multiple steps in the preparation of a sample for testing, including sample sorting, centrifugation, de-capping, and aliquotting. Post-analytic automation is instrumentation which automates single or multiple steps in the processing of a sample after testing, including re-sorting, storage, and retrieval. Professional POC Testing performed at the point of patient care by trained healthcare worker. This includes hospital near patient testing and physician office POC testing. (POL testing is included in the Laboratory Testing Market) R01 The most common type of grant awarded by the NIH. Used to support a specific investigator and research program for 3-5 years. Awarded for research which represents the investigators' specific interests and competencies and that falls within the mission of the participating NIH Institutes and Centers. Random Access Instrumentation Ability to add samples to an instrument at any time without disrupting on-going testing. Each sample can be tested in its own way: Number of tests, type of test (single analyte or multiplex), and specific test(s) performed. Instrument software prioritizes which samples get what test in what order to maximize instrument throughput and minimize TAT. Random Manual Assays Tests which due to low volume and esoteric nature will never be automated and will always be performed manually. Reference Lab Commercial service organizations offering routine and esoteric laboratory services to physician offices, clinics, and hospitals. Demystifying SARS-CoV-2 Testing: First Edition 41April 16, 2020 Glossary Term Definition Research Group Two or more investigators of any tenure or level of experience using shared resources and funding in support of a common mission and goal. Colloquially referred to as a \"lab\". Research Use Only (RUO) A mark given to products indicating that product has NOT been given clearance or approval to be used for clinical purposes. In the US, manufacturers cannot market these products to clinical labs or help them develop tests in their labs that use these products. Sample to Result Automation/Processing A fully automated instrument which allows the operator to input a sample and walk away. The instrument returns a result with no further intervention. Specialty CLIA Lab A term used for two purposes: (More common) to describe a service organization performing proprietary tests (e.g. OncotypeDx) but not performing routine testing. (Less common) to describe divisions of the hospital laboratory performing complicated testing requiring highly trained laboratory technicians. Specialty labs within the hospital include: anatomical pathology labs, microbiology, molecular and blood banks. Turnaround Time (TAT) The time it takes to return a result, either within the context of an instrument or of the whole laboratory procedure, beginning with the sample being loaded onto the instrument and ending with the result being recorded on the instrument. This can also be called the time to result. An alternative definition, not used in this presentation, is the total time it takes from sample acquisition to the time the result reaches the ordering physician. Source: Health Advances analysis.
