Everything you put into your body effects how these plants work within you. Before AND after such a ceremony. Everything put in, on, or around your body (especially food) must be considered in terms of how it harmonizes or clashes with these natural plant medicines and the work they are trying to do inside your body and energy field. In order to maximize your healing and avoid any negative experiences experienced facilitators will follow and recommend a specific diet for their retreats. You can think of this as creating a blank canvas within your system so the plants have as much space as possible to heal you without competition from other sources or interference from lower vibrational energies. Another way to look at it, is that you need to be as clean as possible for the plant to work inside you to its greatest capacity. By eliminating certain things from your diet, what you're doing is cleaning your body - physically and energetically - so that the plants can work and heal you to their fullest. With thanks and much gratitude to my fellow Shamans, Nathan Raaths & Heinrich Reisenhofer, we share the following Dieta guidelines that we follow in our Plant Community, courtesy of wakecircle.com: Dieta and Detoxing for Ayahuasca We generally begin our diets two weeks before our ceremony by phasing out certain foods. A diet of fresh fruit and vegetables and lots of water is the order of the day. The following guidelines are to be followed as certain substances do not mix well with the MAOI component of Ayahuasca and should be avoided: DO NOT EAT: - Fried foods and red meat (at least 1 week before a ceremony). - Small portions of chicken and fish is permitted prior to the ceremony, gradually reducing meat intake nearing your ceremony. - Pork should to be avoided for as long as possible before and after the ceremony. Continuous fresh food intake is always recommended! DO NOT DRINK: - alcohol at least 48 hours before a session. DO NOT HAVE: - NO Sex (or masturbate) at least 48 hours before or after working with the Teacher Plants - NO spicy food, red pepper, chilies, coffee (decaff is fine) etc. 3 days before session - NO fermented food, like pickles, herring, anchovies, mature cheese, etc. 24 hours before and after session. - NO marijuana - to be stopped at least 1 week prior to ceremony - NO Brewer's yeast or any yeast extracts. - NO Protein extracts or supplements. - NO Aspartame (Nutra sweet product) - NO Foods containing MSG (Monosodium glutamate) - Conservative uptake of salt and sugar/honey - 3 days before and after. 3 days prior to your ceremony you are encouraged to remove salt and sugar from your diet entirely. Reducing sugar and salt will heighten the effect of the Teacher Plant, so eliminate these as much as possible from your diet during preparation. On the day of Ceremony Generally, one should not eat 5 hours before a ceremony. Drinking of liquids is to stop 2 hours before ceremony. If the ceremony takes place in the morning, you can eat a light but substantial meal the night before taking the Teacher Plants, but nothing in the morning. If the ceremony takes place in the afternoon, you may have a light breakfast of fruits and cereals. Smoking Commercial (chemically-made) cigarettes generally inhibit the work of Ayahuasca. While natural tobacco is traditionally used as a smudge by the curanderos, our ceremonies are held in smoke-free environments for all participants' sake. For those who find it hard to get through the night without a cigarette, there will be designated smoking zones and we highly encourage you to bring along rolled, natural tobacco if possible. Marijuana Those who use marijuana are respectfully requested to stay away from it from about week before until the end of the ceremony. Ayahuasca needs to work in a marijuana-free environment. The combination of the two can be mischievous. Marijuana has its own potent place in the constellation of healing but should not be used in this ceremony. If this is not possible for you, for the good of everyone else please do not attend an ayahuasca ceremony. Other mind altering and mood enhancing substances. Alcohol, cigarettes and medications all inhibit the work of Ayahuasca. You will generally need to be medication free as they do not mix well. If you are on any mood/mind/depression control medication (or any other kind of prescription medication, are undergoing medical treatment, have a history of emotional or psychotic episodes or just experience any particular sensitivity, immediately inform your shamanic team in order to determine the best way forward. You may be risking your life (or your sanity) by consuming chemically produced drugs (cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, heroine, tik, crystal meth etc) 48 hours BEFORE or AFTER a ceremony. Under no circumstances take any recreational drug while still under the effect of the Teacher Plants. Medications that are contraindicatory with Ayahuasca. The list is extensive and you should contact your shamanic team if you are at all unsure. However, be AWARE of the following: * Certain antidepressants * Ventolin inhalers cannot be consumed from the morning. * Any antihistamines at least 48 hours prior to night of ceremony * Epilepsy medication * Steroids and muscle building formulas with creatine in them are strictly prohibited! * Certain painkillers * Cough syrups * Blood pressure medications * Diet pills Preparation for a Teacher Plant Ceremony - Be sure to get plenty of sleep and drink more pure water than you usually do. - Before the day of a ceremony (and for as many days as you can before) eat only fruit and vegetables. - On the day of the ceremony, have your last meal (fruit or vegetables only) before 12h00. This helps to prepare the working environment in your body and mind. At the start of a ceremony, an empty digestive tract is ideal. It's good to feel hungry at the start of a journey and the hunger will disappear. This also helps to avoid digestive discomfort during the ceremony. Being able to fast a few days before, or even a few hours before, would be the most ideal preparation as you will have less physical density to work through, and will therefore be able to move straight to the emotional and mental bodies. In Conlusion Ideally you should spend one to two weeks detoxing your body. This will have massive holistic benefits and we encourage you to not leave your detox till the last moment as it can often leave you starting the ceremony with headaches or will make it harder for the medicine to digest. Safety first - Relax and enjoy this "}
